<plain_text><page sequence="1">Berkeley Inside Out: Existence and Destiny in Waiting for Godot Norma Kroll, Providence College . . . since the death of Bishop Berkeley ... no matter what matter1 .... Although some readers of Beckett's Waiting for Godot have noted Lucky's cryptic references to Bishop Berkeley and to the matterless state of things, they have yet to see that his phrases provide clues to the play's singular world view.2 For example, John Pilling finds that Berkeley's im materialism "has obvious attractions to a man like Beckett," primarily because it satisfies his fascination with the "passivity and potential non existence of human beings" while enabling him to omit "the transcen dent being" who alone is active.3 Yet, if we explore the play's cos mology?the principles which determine the origin and space-time structure of the world as an orderly or, more precisely, a disorderly sys tem, we will see that Beckett exploits the philosopher's universe because it privileges the creative activity of both the cosmic and human imagina tions.4 As I will argue, Beckett builds on Berkeley's belief that reality con sists wholly of images conceived by God and perceived by humans, but inverts the philosopher's trust in God's unwavering regard of his cre ation. Rather, Beckett treats Godot, whom the characters invoke inter changeably with God, and who appears to rule their destiny, as an unseen cosmic observer who has withdrawn his mind's eye from the human pre dicament.5 This change cascades throughout the play, making human 1 Waiting for Godot (New York: Grove Press, 1954), p. 29a.

But his choice of Sartre as the main influence is curious: Sartre's philosophical system was predicated on free human choices and Beckett's characters are "tied.

" 5 Although Beckett has always been notoriously unforthcoming about explaining his works, he emphasizes that he exploits theological and philosophical systems for their de signs: "I am interested in the shape of ideas . . . even if I do not believe in them.

Bishop Berkeley, an eighteenth-century immaterialist philosopher and Anglican churchman, argued that "esse est percipi aut percipere" (to exist is to be perceived or to perceive),7 with God the all-perceiver. He uses perceiv ing, in God's case, as the term for the comprehensive category of mental activities?from imagining to remembering and conceiving?and, in humankind's case, for activities shifted to the sensory realm. As Berkeley believed, human beings can see (or hear or touch) the world and its inhabitants and thus assume that everything is composed of matter. But minds actually perceive only mental images, so that humans could not experience the world if it consisted of anything but clusters of images or ideas (pp. 66, 116). Berkeley's God conceives the images which constitute reality and then, by some humanly unimaginable process, observes them as they combine and interact in his mind. This cosmic perceiver differs significantly from the Christian savior. According to A. C. Grayling, in his masterful study of Berkeley, Christians see destiny as determined by the Creator, an "interested God," who personally rewards or punishes each individual, while Berkeley believed that destiny is generated by a disin terested metaphysical Mind who impersonally maintains the universe as a whole by observing it.8 In Godot, Beckett asks what if the cosmic observer should opt to pay only minimal attention to his creation, a metaphysical question which wonderful sentence in Augustine . . . 'Do not despair; one of the thieves was saved. Do not presume; one of the thieves was damned. ' That sentence has a wonderful shape. It is the shape that matters" (quoted in Hugh Kenner's Samuel Beckett: A Critical Study [Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1968], p. 100). For Beckett, reality consists of ideas which have no matter but do have "shape[s]." He believed the essence of artistic creation to be the rec onciliation of "the contraries of form and chaos" and "art and reality" without "surrender ing to either," as S. E. Gontarski puts it in his superb study of Beckett's visions and revisions, The Intent of Undoing in Samuel Beckett's Dramatic Texts (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1985), p. 14. 6Bert O. States perceptively finds that Beckett has "the homing instinct of a true escha tologist" but invents "a new myth, or story about the plight of modern man," which is "aimed at accommodating modern problems of despair and alienation" (The Shape of Para dox [Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1978], pp. 19-20). 7Berkeley, Philosophical Works (London: J. M. Dent, 1975) pp. 84, 104, 199. 8Grayling, Berkeley: The Central Arguments (La Salle, 111.: Open Court, 1986), p. 186. See also Berkeley (pp. 90, 84, 88, 96-97).</page><page sequence="3">532 Kroll inverts Berkeley's belief that God has chosen to focus fully and eternally on the universe because he is "infinitely wise, good, and perfect" (p. 123). Berkeley felt that the order and continuity of the creation? "the surprising magnificence, beauty, and perfection" as well as the "ex act harmony and correspondence of the whole"?attests to God's absolute power. Very differently, Beckett locates Vladimir and Estragon in a universe plagued by disjunctions, a universe which serves as evidence that God's detachment has become so extreme that he seems virtually powerless. His failure is underscored by his name, Godot, a joining of God and -ot, the reductive French ending typical of nicknames. In Ber nard Dukore's words, "perhaps Godot is a diminutive God, a puny God." 9 Although Vladimir and Estragon intuitively recognize that Godot is able to "see" their plight and "think it over," they see him as so inef fective that he has to "Consult his family" or "friends" or "agents," seek ing help "Before taking a decision" (p. 13a). These comments may seem naive and disjointed but, as Bert O. States explains, "[o]nce out of a character's mouth," such insights tend to "hover in the air . . . nonrefer entially, the property of the play's idea," not of the character's particular awareness (p. 13). In essence, Vladimir and Estragon are intrinsic parts of the play's mind-world, so that their instinctive comments, even when outwardly trivial or disconnected, function as transparent expressions of the world's diminished cosmic principles and processes. Beckett's fascination with Berkeley's ideas about the world-creating powers of the mind is apparently lifelong, central even in his early critical study, Proust (1931).10 He wrote this work while on a fellowship from Trinity College, where he had, as it were, particular links to Berkeley, for he, like the philosopher, went from student to instructor, and his tutor, A. A. Luce, was also the great scholar and editor of Berkeley's works. Luce, however, did espouse Berkeley's metaphysics,11 while Beckett al 9Dukore, "Gogo, Didi, and the absent Godot," Drama Survey, i (1962), 302. See also M. F. Vaughan's "Beckett's Naming of Godot," Studia Neophilologa, 52 (1980), 119-22. Some critics object to the argument that Godot is a version of God because the play was first written in French and the French word for God is "Dieu." But the characters' names are another of Beckett's interlingual jokes: "Vladimir" is neither French nor English but Rus sian (mighty prince) and "Lucky" is English. Clearly, theology is one of the major top ics of the play, which abounds with other hints about Godot's role as God. Vladimir and Estragon use both names interchangeably, and the sheep boy gives Godot a white beard (echoing Lucky's description of God). As James Knowlson finds, "the protagonist [in How It Is] is driven to postulate a single and omnipotent Other of Godlike proportions, whose mercy seems thoroughly arbitrary and random" and "inhuman" (see Knowlson and John Pilling's Frescoes of the Skull: The Later Prose and Drama of Samuel Beckett [New York: Grove Press, 1980], p. 70). 10Beckett, Proust (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1931; rpt.

This book is more an extended appreciation and affirmation of Berkeley's beliefs than an objective discussion of his philosophy.</page><page sequence="4">Berkeley Inside Out 533 ways creates an ironic distance between others' philosophical systems and the worlds in his fictions. Perhaps for this reason, scholars see that the aesthetic principles which Beckett approves in his reading of Proust prove "central to his own vision" in Godot,12 without noting the Berkele ian cast of Beckett's interpretation. Beckett reads A la Recherche du temps perdu as if Proust had either exploited or reinvented Berkeleian notions of an omnipotent God-mind. For example, he sees Proust's characters as Berkeleian images or "projection [s] of" the narrator's "consciousness," with Albertine, the focus of the narrator's desire, symbolizing "immate rial reality" (pp. 8, 33). Beckett also describes her in terms that anticipate Godot, as the "source of comfort and salvation that no miracle could replace" and as the one "who has promised to come and who does not come" (pp. 34-35). In the play, however, Beckett distinguishes between the created and the creator, representing Vladimir and Estragon as the human images and Godot as the neglectful imaginer. Beckett highlights his manipulation of Berkeley's paradigms most ex plicitly in Film (1964), written more than ten years after Godot.12, This script has "Esse est percipi" as its opening rubric and features a human figure striving to escape the "inescapability of self-perception."14 This character is "sundered into object (O) and eye (E), [with] the former in flight, the latter in pursuit" (p. 163). Yet, O seeks to avoid all eyes, God's and other humans' as well as his own. Although the God-perceiver is reduced to a print of "God the Father, the eyes staring at him severely" from the walls, O does not sit down to work until he destroys the picture (p. 167). He also covers a mirror, in an elaborate set of maneuvers de signed to keep his image from ever appearing thereon. He finally de stroys photographs which capture images of others observing images of him at successive stages in his life (pp. 173-74). Yet O fa^s because, even as he "covers" his own eyes, the camera twice cuts "back to E," who has 12See Robert Torrance, "Modes of Being and Time in the World of Godot," MLQ 28 (1967), 78. 13 The Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (New York: Grove Press, 1984), p. 163. In many of his other fictions, Beckett uses Berkeley obliquely, alluding to the philosopher as if his ideas about a God-centered world merely provided an ironic counterpoint to the charac ters' struggles with a God-forsaken one. In Murphy (1935), for example, the narrator mocks Berkeley's Siris, a late treatise on the healing properties of tar-water, deriding any possibility that the eponymous hero might adopt ideas held by the "idealist tar" ([New York: Grove Press, 1957], p. 108). 14See Gontarski's Intent (pp. 101-11) and "Film and Formal Integrity," in Samuel Beckett: Humanistic Perspectives, ed. M. Beja, S. E. Gontarski, and P. Astier (Columbus: Ohio State Univ. Press, 1983). His study offers a highly perceptive analysis of Beckett's use of "the cam era as a relentless, omnipresent perceiver" (p. 134). More recently, Sylvie Debevec Henning underscores the complex turnings of Beckett's use of Berkeley in her insightful discussion o?Film as a representation which takes "Berkeley seriously... in order to point up the weak spot in his generally fascinating work" (Beckett's Critical Complicity: Carnival, Contestation, and Tradition [Lexington: Univ. of Kentucky Press, 1988], pp. 131-32).</page><page sequence="5">534 Kroll O's face and watches him with "acute intentness" (p. 169). Thus Film be comes a dynamic image of Berkeley's principles. In the more complex world of Godot, Vladimir and Estragon seek to be perceived in full, focusing obsessively on keeping God's mind's eye on them as well as on observing each other. To Estragons "Do you think God sees me," Vladimir answers, "You must close your eyes" (p. 49b). This elliptical exchange makes sense only in a Berkeleian context. If Es tragon stops perceiving and continues to exist, he is being perceived. Yet neither of the human characters can be certain that the sustaining ob server is God and not the other, although they know instinctively that a cosmic observer is vital. Indeed, they compete desperately for God's at tention: Estragon "brandishing his fists, at the top of his voice" cries out, "God have pity on me!"; Vladimir, "vexed" at being excluded, adds, "And me?"; Estragon, however, merely repeats "On me! On me! Pity! On me!" In the context of their test of God's regard, their urgent calls for his mercy, followed by Estragons assumption that Godot has re sponded to their plea, reinforces Beckett's ironic equation of God and Godot and his emphasis on Berkeleian perceiving as saving. The climactic encounters between Vladimir and Estragon and Godot's messengers illuminate the crucial importance of being perceived. The messengers are a goat and a sheep boy, tasks which directly evoke the eschatological New Testament parable of the goats and the sheep (Mat thew 25.32). But, in Godot, scriptural names and motifs suggesting the Christian ends of destiny, whether salvation or damnation, function ironically, because no saving or damning acts ever occur. Instead, the two boys affirm both Godot's existence and his indifference: the first announces that "Mr. Godot told me to tell you he won't come this eve ning but surely to-morrow" (p. 33b), and the second promises "to morrow . . . [w]ithout fail" (p. 58b). Instinctively, Vladimir goes right to the crux of his and Estragons need: "Tell him [Godot] . . . (he hesitates) . . . tell him you saw us. (Pause.) You did see us, didn't you?" (p. 34a). The intensity of this seemingly rhetorical question highlights Vladimir's fear that he and Estragon might not be visible, as if their des tiny ultimately depends on the possibility of being seen by Godot. Yet Godot's inadequacy, not Vladimir and Estragon's, is the cause of their plight. Neither messenger offers any real hope that Godot might attend to his petitioners, and the second boy addresses Vladimir as "Mr. Albert" (p. 58b) ("noble" and "bright") which suggests that he is both worth perceiving and radiates or reflects sufficient light to be seen.15 In 15 Shimon Levy looks at Beckett's lighting directions in several plays and concludes that, for the dramatist, light is always connected to life (Samuel Beckett's Self Referential Drama [London: Macmillan, 1990], pp. 3-38). Correspondingly, Pilling perceptively explains that,</page><page sequence="6">Berkeley Inside Out 535 an attempt to compensate for Godot's heedlessness, therefore, Vladimir charges the sheep boy with an even more intense version of his earlier message to Godot: "tell him you saw me and that. . . (he hesitates) . . . that you saw me. (Pause. Vladimir advances, the Boy recoils. Vladimir halts, the Boy halts. With sudden violence.) You're sure you saw me, you won't come and tell me to-morrow that you never saw me!" (p. 59a). The obsessiveness of his fourfold repetition of "saw" emphasizes the necessity of being per ceived. This need stems not from trust in divine mercy or justice but from mistrust in a cosmic perceiver's will to observe. As Hugh Kenner sagely remarks, whatever "metaphysics . . . the Beckett theater will permit" en tails a "hierarchy of watchers and watched" (p. 137). Ii: BREAKING THE PROMISE Beckett's representation of a universe plagued by discontinuities makes Godot the nexus between causality or, more accurately, acausality and destiny. The lack of cause and effect in the natural world is Berkeleian: for the philosopher, God's mind alone engenders the "immediate and sole operation" of the regular succession of images which humans see as causality in "nature" (pp. 124, 81, 89-100, 156-59). Because these images in themselves do not act on or interact with any others, "one idea or object of thought cannot produce, or make any alteration in another," but is, by its very nature as a perception or mental impression, passive and inert (p. 84). In essence, each image is distinct from every other, which allows for interstices, no matter how infinitesimal or impercep tible, between them. Berkeley, however, denied "that bodies are annihi lated and created every moment, or exist not at all during the intervals between our perception of them" (p. 91), because he believed that God exercises his "will," or active imagination, to forestall the appearance of any disconnections (p. 85). Hence, causality and coherence seem to rule in the natural world only while God focuses his mind's eye directly thereon. Even so, Berkeley knew that the internal logic of his system calls for the repeated alternation of existence and nonexistence and that we cannot simply assume "that the Author of Nature always operates uni formly" because "we cannot evidently know" (p. no).16 This problem, which the philosopher could not deny, perhaps made Berkeley's system still more attractive to Beckett, for, as S. E. Gontarski perceptively ob in Happy Days, Beckett focuses on the "need for a witness to validate one's own existence [a need which requires light] " and on "the compulsion to go on saying words," with both in keeping with "Bishop Berkeley's dictum 'to be is to be perceived' " (Frescoes, p. 99). 16Luce, too, felt it necessary to deny that such gaps could develop in the universe (Ber keley's Immaterialism [London: Thomas Nelson, 1945], p. 106).</page><page sequence="7">536 Kroll serves, his Active worlds and "characters are hounded by the inconsisten cies of systems" which western theologians and philosophers devised to explain God and universe.17 Beckett delineates his version of the relationship between the creative will and destiny in Proust, where he explicitly privileges worlds that are patently intermittent. He sees portraying such states as a major sign of greatness in a poet because acausality is the reality and causality an illu sion. Beckett extols Proust for revealing the invisible "non-logical" suc cession "of phenomena in the order and exactitude of their perception, before they have been distorted into intelligibility in order to be forced into a chain of cause and effect" (p. 66).18 He describes Proust's mind in terms that echo Berkeley's explanation of God as the "pure subject" and causal medium of the world in the novel, but he sees the mind as most creative when "almost exempt from the impurity of will" (p. 69). Berke ley trusted the cosmic will to create the illusion of a coherent universe, while Beckett impugns the will as "utilitarian" and "not a condition of the artistic experience" for the same reason (p. 69). Vladimir and Estragon's destiny reflects Beckett's conviction that " [w]hen the subject is exempt from will the object is exempt from cau sality (Time and Space taken together)" (p. 69). Vladimir worries over the disconnectedness of time?"And where were we yesterday evening according to you?"?but Estragon accepts such gaps as inevitable? "How would I know? In another compartment. There's no lack of void." This last quite frightening assertion nonetheless strikes Vladimir as a re assuring truth?"(sure of himself). Good. We weren't here yesterday eve ning" (p. 42b). He has located himself, albeit negatively, according to where he was not, the only kind of certainty afforded by time and space. As the curiously precise term?"compartment"?implies, humans ap pear and reappear variously in scattered pockets of time and space. Es tragon's "void" becomes not a metaphysical abyss at the core of reality but areas of nothingness which sporadically interrupt the pattern of ex 17Gontarski, "Literary Allusions in 'Happy Days'," in On Beckett:Essays and Criticism (New York: Grove Press, 1986), pp. 308-9. 18 Schopenhauer was attractive to Beckett, not only for his theory of the world as both will and idea but also for his rejection of the Christian belief that God could be absolute goodness and the world a state of total misery (Pilling, p. 120). Yet Beckett's emphasis on the inertness of the images comprising reality belies Schopenhauer's belief that "matter is nothing more than causation" for "its true being is its action" (The World as Will and Idea [London: Regan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., 1910], 1,10). Gontarski, too, sees that Beckett is concerned "finally not [with] the world as matter but [with] The World as Idea" (Intent, p. 20). He also concludes that, "one interpretation of Waiting for Godot... as an autobio graphical account of Beckett and Susanne's flight from Paris to the Vauclose" notwithstand ing, "the play is fundamentally about stasis, not an arduousjourney" (Intent, p. 35). Indeed, the world in Godot is matterless and the characters passive.</page><page sequence="8">Berkeley Inside Out 537 istence. Thus, the universe of Godot stands bare of the illusion that space and time are coherent, an illusion of causality that most creators of fic tions, like Berkeley's God, deliberately simulate in their works. Central to this world is the tree?its sparseness a sign of Godot's inade quacy?which functions as the anchoring point of Vladimir and Estra gon's wait for Godot and the emblem of the world's acausality. Bare in the first act, the "tree has four or five leaves" in the second (p. 37a). This change could occur because, during the intermission, no one was watch ing the tree, neither Vladimir and Estragon nor members of the play's audience nor, apparently, Godot. By way of emphasizing that whatever exists does so only while being perceived and that such perceiving is a creative human activity, Vladimir "remember[s]" the tree, seeks it out, and sees it?"Look at it." Estragon, who is "tired" and not thinking, "see[s] nothing" until Vladimir calls his attention thereto and "[t]hey look at the tree" (p. 42b). But their mental images still differ and, for an other moment, they see a different tree. Vladimir measures his memory of the tree against its current appearance and notes that "yesterday eve ning it was all black and bare. And now it's covered with leaves." He perceives either a different tree in the same place or the same tree dis placed in time. In either case, the gaps in his perception of the world foreground its intermittency. Differently, Estragons surprised "Leaves?" emphasizes that he cannot bear such a disjunction. He, like the typical fiction-maker whom Beckett disparages in Proust, reinterprets reality, for mulating a causal paradigm to explain away the change: "It must be the Spring." Yet, Vladimir's insistent "In a single night," and "But in a single night!" discredits so easy a rationalization. The two characters thus come up against the kinds of disjunctions which Beckett explains in Proust: "the figure of Time could be represented by an endless series of paral lels,"as the narrator's "life is switched over to another line and proceeds, without any solution of continuity" (pp. 26-27). The potential for non existence built into this model of reality underlies Vladimir and Estra gon's recurrent sense of being lost in time or of having lost the things of time. Indeed, Vladimir and Estragon cannot count on the continued exis tence even of manmade objects, given that Godot has become unreliable and that, by nature, humans are intermittent perceivers. Distracted by other concerns, they have lost sight of Estragons footgear: Vladimir's "Where are your boots?" prompts Estragons "I must have thrown them away" (p. 43a). Yet the phrase "must have" implies that he does not ac tually recall doing any such thing. Ironically, Vladimir's sudden percep tion of the boots?"At the very spot where you left them yesterday!"? exacerbates rather than resolves their dilemma. He expects to see boots</page><page sequence="9">538 Kroll and does, but, given Estragon's "They're not mine" and his own close examination, even Vladimir has to accept that they are not the same boots?"(stupefied). Not yours!"?although not without some disgust? "Well of all the?" (p. 43b). By implication, Vladimir calls up a different pair or recalls the same pair in a different form and color. Yet, he, like Estragon when faced with a seemingly inexplicable change in the tree, cannot bear to recognize just how precarious their reality is and takes his turn at trying to paper over the discontinuity. He seizes on the more logical possibility that some third person "came and took yours and left you his." Comically, this attempt only leads them into a deeper muddle over whether or not the boots would be "too tight" for the new owner and emphasizes that they cannot account causally for what they see. Es tragon, "having tried in vain to work it out, " wants only to escape a situation that makes no sense to him: "Let's go." The problem is that, as Vladimir intuitively realizes, "We can't.... We're waiting for Godot" (p. 44a). They are bound by necessity to Godot, lest their existence too become intermittent. Beckett highlights the dynamics of the mental universe in Vladimir and Estragon's images of cosmic and human existence as overlapping dream-states. Estragon senses that reality is immaterial: he "gesture[s] to wards the universe" and questions whether " [t]his one [dream] is enough for you? (Silence.) It's not nice of you, Didi. Who am I to tell my private nightmares to if I can't tell them to you?" (p. na). The two humans' dreams differ from Godot's because the former are personal or "private" and the latter public or shared. For Estragon, the human condition con sists of a nightmarish or surrealistic jumble of images existing within some sort of disarranged metaphysical imagination. Analogously, Vladi mir focuses on the acts of perceiving that create and maintain each sphere of observation. Just as he watches Estragon sleep, he knows that "At me too someone is looking, of me too someone is saying, He is sleep ing, he knows nothing, let him sleep on" (p. 58b). These parallel insights explain why the play's landscape seems ambiguous, as if it were at once tangible and intangible or objective and subjective. Vladimir and Estra gon's sleeping and waking states alike are perceptible mental terrains, a variation on the world highlighted in Beckett's earlier novel, Watt, where "there was no other place, but only there where Mr. Knott was," in "this soul-landscape." 19 Although the insufficiency of Vladimir and Estragon's world leads them repeatedly to thoughts of escaping Godot's purview, they recognize that their destiny compels them to remain. To Estragon's "And if we dropped him?" Vladimir replies "He'd punish us" and adds 19Beckett, Watt (New York: Grove Press, 1959), pp. 199 and 249.</page><page sequence="10">Berkeley Inside Out 539 "[e]verything's dead but the tree" (p. 59b). The alliteration of "dropped" and "dead" calls attention to his instinctive awareness that abandoning Godot would lead to the loss of vitality, if not of existence. Vladimir and Estragon are "Tied to Godot! What an idea! No question of it. (Pause.) For the moment" (p. 14b). The last three phrases are highly ambiguous. Their relationship to Godot is both figuratively and literally an "idea," allowing "no question" that the connection is mental or that it has binding force. Yet Vladimir's emphasis on the transient "moment" also implies that their association with Godot might well be in process and subject to change. In this context, Godot is indeed a negative "Sav iour" or arbiter of destiny, since the responsibility for the failure of full ness and coherence is his. UK DESTINY AS FORTUNE AND FORTUNE AS POSSIBILITY AND CHANGE The play's title identifies both its main action?waiting?and its focus? Godot?but its subtitle, "A tragicomedy," indicates that its structure is built on a mix of fate and fortune, the main subsets of destiny, associated respectively with the two major dramatic genres. However, the insuffi ciency of Godot's attention, the immediate cause of events in the world of the play, so diminishes fate, or the law of necessity, that it dwindles into fortune, offering only the prospect of randomness. In turn, even fortune becomes increasingly chancy: Vladimir instinctively responds to Pozzo and Lucky's cries for help by claiming that he and Estragon have "the chance" to "do something," to cope with "a cruel fate" (p. 51a). The combination of these almost antithetical concepts emphasizes that fate is subject to chance and thus functions arbitrarily, like fortune. Yet fortune, which dominates the action, becomes inexorable, retaining tragic overtones because it cannot alter the inescapable randomness of their situation. Beckett foregrounds the complex pattern of Vladimir and Estragons fortune (or misfortune) in their encounters with Pozzo and Lucky. These figures embody, respectively, fortune and its servant, chance (or luck), and thus make the two faces of destiny not only per ceivable but also human. Beckett provides fairly explicit clues to Pozzo and Lucky's roles. In the French text, Pozzo proclaims that he woke up one morning "aveugle comme le destin."20 In the later British and American versions, however, Beckett deliberately alters the phrase to "blind as Fortune" (p. 55b), part of a set of changes that progressively underscores his adaptation of Ber 20Beckett, En attendant Godot (Paris: Les Editions de Minuit, 1952), p. 146.</page><page sequence="11">540 Kroll keley's belief system to his own purposes.21 Despite Estragon's uncertain "Perhaps he can see into the future" (p. 54b), Pozzo's blindness signals not that he has become a Tiresian seer or agent of fate but that, as he himself proclaims, he has lost all possibility of perceiving the Berkeleian images that constitute time: "The blind have no notion of time. The things of time are hidden from them too" (p. 55b). Correspondingly, Lucky has also deteriorated, becoming "dumb" (p. 57a)?an implied pun on dumb luck. Significantly, blindness limits perceiving and speech lessness hampers being perceived. Pozzo's name provides two clues to his role as fortune and the impli cations about its operations in the world of this play. He insists that the word should have meaning for Vladimir and Estragon: " (terrifying voice). I am Pozzo! (Silence.) . . . Does that name mean nothing to you? (Silence.) I say does that name mean nothing to you?" (p. 15b).22 First, it suggests the Latin posse, literally, to be able and, figuratively, to be possible. Beck ett may well be drawing on Luce's scholarly interpretation of Berkeley's percipi as "possepercipi" or "to be possible to be perceived," with the pos sibility ultimately dependent on God's observations (see Berkeley, p. 78, and Luce23). Pozzo validates his primary connection to Vladimir and Es tragon as a possible visual perception: "As far as one can see" (p. 15b). His function as the possibility of perceiving and of being perceived also explains why he arrives as if in response to Vladimir and Estragon's call for Godot and yet knows nothing about Godot. Although human pos sibility ultimately derives from the metaphysical source of things, it can not do the impossible, make that source accessible to sense experience. Second, the literal meaning of Pozzo's name?"well" in Italian?im plies both origins and limits, in this case of human possibility.24 The word signifies an issue of water from the earth, a pool fed by a spring, a deep vertical hole containing water, an enclosed place in the hold of a fishing boat in which fish are kept alive (evoking Estragon's "compartment[s]" of perceivable time and space), and a deep reservoir from which one 21 See Hersh Zeifman's useful discussion of other changes in "The Alterable Whey of Words: The Texts of Waiting for Godot," Educational Theater Journal, 29 (1977), 77-84. 22Scholars offer diverse views of Pozzo's nature and acts, seeing him, for example, as Godot or a God-figure, as a tyrant or slave-master, as a fertility figure, or as a Satanic being. See Stephani Pofahl Smith, "Between Pozzo and Godot: Existence as Dilemma," TheFrench Review, 47 (1974), 889-903; Curtis M. Brooks, "The Mythic Pattern in Waiting for Godot," ModernDrama, 9 (1966), 292-99; and George Martin, " 'Pozzo and Lucky': A Key to Godot," The American Benedictine Review, 28 (1977), 397-412. 23 Luce, The Dialectics of Immaterialism (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1963), p. 61. 24Some scholars assume that the name means crazy, which is pozzo in Italian, although Beckett may well have intended his characterization of Pozzo to evoke the irrational.</page><page sequence="12">Berkeley Inside Out 541 may draw. Vladimir and Estragon might well be poor fish trapped in a hold: indeed, Estragon remembers "the day I threw myself into the Rhone" and "You [Vladimir] fished me out" (p. 35a); he also finds that the chicken bones thrown to the ground by Pozzo "were like fishbones" (p. 43a). Ironically, the realm of human possibility, whether seen as a compartment or a landscape, offers only the barest sort of nourishment. Correspondingly, Lucky embodies the luck of individual humans in making fortune a kind of gamble. Hence, Pozzo plans to take Lucky "to the fair, where" he "hope[s] to get a good price for him" even though he sees that "you can't drive such creatures away" (p. 21b). To profit from luck, either in buying and selling or in games of chance, is to obtain the best that fortune can offer, and yet luck, whether good or bad, always remains attached to fortune. The rope is a sign of this connection or interplay. Lucky is set in motion when Pozzo "jerks the rope" (pp. 15a, i6a-b, 20a, 26a), bringing Pozzo the basket containing the best imagin able food and drink. Essentially, however, fortune and luck are always arbitrary: Pozzo "might just as well have been in" Lucky's "shoes and he in mine" if "chance had not willed otherwise" (p. 21b). Like the possibilities constituting fortune, chance must be perceived in order to be realized, particularly since it has become highly unpre dictable and painful. For example, Lucky arbitrarily kicks Estragon be cause, as Pozzo explains, "[h]e's wicked. . . . [w]ith strangers" (p. 15a), and Estragon is indeed a stranger to luck. For Beckett in Godot, as for Berkeley, all movement, like a kick or an embrace, is "relative," for "mo tion includes a relation of one thing to another" (pp. 111-12), whether the relationship is between two humans or between humans and luck. Thus, "[i]t's the natural order" that Lucky should dance before he thinks (p. 26b), with the dance making the dynamics of his connection to Vladimir and Estragon visible. This dance is named "The Net" be cause Lucky "thinks he's entangled in a net" (p. 27a). The key word is "think," for the dance is a perceivable manifestation of a mental activity, as spasmodic and agonizing as his metaphysical "think." Appropriately, then, Vladimir and Estragon name the dance the "Scapegoat's Agony" or the "Hard Stool," phrases which imply the gut-level torment that they perceive as their luck. Beckett's characterization of Pozzo and Lucky requires us to exam ine his subtle distinction between conventional allegory and the con crete embodiment of the thing in itself. The two figures are not allegori cal personifications of abstract ideas or principles of fortune existing in some nonsensory or nonperceivable order of reality. Beckett argues that allegory "must always fail in the hands of a poet" and that characters</page><page sequence="13">542 Kroll must be "handled as a reality, special, literal and concrete," with each functioning as a "living symbol" or "symbol of itself " (Proust, p. 60) ,25 These assertions recapitulate Berkeley, who denied that Platonic (or other) abstract ideas could exist, primarily because they cannot be per ceived (p. 81). But he accepted the existence of "general ideas" or con crete images derived from and "made to represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the same sort" (pp. 69-70). In Godot, Pozzo (like Lucky) is just such a manifestation of a perceivable Berkeleian image: he, like Vladimir and Estragon, is "[m]ade in God's image" (p. 15b), an ironic Berkeleian variation on the Biblical phrase. Lest we miss the Berkeleian implications of "image," Beckett gives us Pozzo's derisive as sertion that Vladimir and Estragon are "human beings none the less," for they are, as anyone "can see" or perceive, of "the same species as myself." The seemingly simple term?"species," which derives from spe cere, to observe, look, or regard?opens up a complex set of associations. It means not only "a class of individuals having common attributes and a common name" and a "category of biological classification" but also, in philosophical parlance which seems virtually Berkeleian, "a mental image," a "sensible object," and an "object of thought correlative with a natural object" (Websters New Collegiate Dictionary). Yet, Pozzo declares himself "perhaps not particularly human" (p. 19b), with "particularly" implying a specific person. Thus, Beckett offers a rather subtle distinc tion: human fortune is necessarily played out by humans, but it is differ ent from an individual human being. Beckett establishes a reciprocal relationship between the two pairs of characters, for humans depend on fortune and chance which, in turn, depend on the human characters to enact both. Pozzo maintains that "I cannot go for long without the society of my likes . . . even when the likeness is an imperfect one" (p. 16b). By implication, a person is the manifested image of his (or her) fortune, although not an exact image thereof, and thus fleshes out its development: "From the meanest crea ture one departs wiser, richer, more conscious of one's blessings. Even you . . . (he looks at them ostentatiously in turn to make it clear they are both meant) . . . even you, who knows, will have added to my store" (p. 20a). Wisdom, wealth, and grace not only benefit human beings but also add to the supply of human fortune in the universe. Yet this supply cannot exist apart from human beings (as it could in an allegorical representa 25 As Cedric Watts recognizes in "The Ambushes of Beckett's Waiting for Godot: A Lecture in a Series on Tragedy" (Kwartalnik Neofilologiczy [Warszawa, Poland], 25 [1978], 187-200), "allegoric interpretations [of Beckett's works] generally seem to fail because they have a reassuring clarity and definiteness, whereas the text has offered slippery ambiguities" (p.192).</page><page sequence="14">Berkeley Inside Out 543 tion), no matter how trivial their natures or situations have become. The answer to Vladimir's "Will you not play?" and Estragons "Play at what?" is "play at Pozzo and Lucky" (p. 47a). The two humans pass the time in a randomly chosen, comic version of their fortune, an activity which en ables them to survive. So, too, Pozzo finds it almost impossible to detach himself from Vladimir and Estragon: "I don't seem able . . . (long hesitation) ... to depart," and Estragon supplies the reason: "Such is life" (p. 31a). Human possibility requires time and space to develop or not, as the case may be. Pozzo's "land," where the "road is free to all" (p. 16a), becomes the space where the two humans wait for the possible arrival of Godot and instead encounter their fortune. Likewise, Pozzo's watch functions symbolically, as the visible embodiment of the nature and workings of time. It is a timepiece handed down in time, given to Pozzo by his "granpa" (p. 30b), a manifestation of time, not an allegorical im age. Initially, in the French version, Beckett depicts the watch as a "v?ri table savonnette, Messieurs, ? secondes trotteuses"?"a real hunter watch with a center second hand" (p. 64). In the British and the Ameri can texts, Beckett pointedly changes the description to a "genuine half hunter" "with deadbeat escapement." A hunter is a pocket-watch with a full cover over the front, hiding the movement of time; a half-hunter has a small window over the center of the dial. This window reveals the mo tion of the hands which connect the unperceivable circumference and the visible center, perhaps evoking the lines of destiny by which the non sensory images of time in God's mind impact on Vladimir and Estragon's sense experiences. The half-hunter's "deadbeat escapement," a techni cal term which also evokes Vladimir and Estragon's down-at-the-heels condition, is a clock mechanism with a pendulum which swings as the timepiece ticks and an escape wheel which stops between each tick. Time in Godot is fundamentally Berkeleian?a succession of discrete images, not causally related to each other, but rather conceived individually by the God-mind (Berkeley, p. 253). But its manifestation is Beckettian, intermittent and insufficient. Pozzo's loss of the watch, like that of his sight, underscores Beckett's representation of the ways that temporal possibility depends on percep tions and that perceptions can be interrupted. Even fortune cannot keep time going unless either the cosmic perceiver or a human being con tinuously observes it. Indeed, fortune is time-dependent. Pozzo must "observe [his] schedule" so that he can continue to function: hence, he emphatically counters Vladimir's portentous "Time has stopped" by holding up his watch as visible evidence: "cuddlinghis watch to his ear, " he insists, "Don't you believe it, Sir, don't you believe it. (He puts his watch</page><page sequence="15">544 Kroll back in his pocket.) Whatever you like, but not that" (p. 24b). This rhetori cal exchange would seem to be merely a way of passing time, except that, once out of sight, the watch itself vanishes, as if it had flickered out of existence. As Berkeley explained, "it is impossible" for any mind other than God's to "see or feel anything," even time which is the succession of perceptions of objects and events, "without an actual sensation ofthat thing" (p. 78). In turn, Vladimir and Estragon perceive that whatever time they have to play out their destiny depends on fortune, which offers them some possibility of being seen by Godot. In Pozzo's words, Vladimir ought to "Think twice before you do anything rash. Suppose you go now while it is still day, for there is no denying it is still day," for then "what happens in that case to your appointment with this . . . Godet . . . Godot . . . Godin . . . anyhow you see who I mean, who has your future in his hands ... at least your immediate future" (p. 19b). Pozzo's uncertainty about Godot's name implies that human fortune does not enjoy an un ambiguous connection to the cosmic perceiver. Yet his repetition of "day" and emphasis on "see" echoes Berkeley's belief that vision is the main channel of perception and of clarity of understanding. Thus, Vla dimir and Estragon's "future," the next stage in their destiny, depends on how well they follow Pozzo's advice. Pozzo and Lucky's roles as professors of the very nature of the universe signals another dimension to the workings of possibility and chance. Beckett draws on Berkeley's epistemology to augment Pozzo and Lucky's roles, albeit with an ironic twist.26 He portrays them as actual producers of the only two kinds of knowledge possible in a Berkeleian world, the regular sensory information that comes by way of perceptions, and the random intuitive flashes that come by chance and constitute luck, whether good or ill. As Pozzo admits, he can only have and transmit or dinary "thoughts" and "feelings" about "common things" (p. 22b). This last phrase echoes Berkeley's emphasis on "common sense," his term for the sensory perceptions that are the stuff of the world. Pozzo assumes, therefore, that his major contribution to Vladimir and Estragon's well being is to have "explained the twilight" (p. 26a): the light "begins to lose its effulgence, to grow pale . . . pale, ever a little paler, a little paler" (p. 25a). His explication does not focus on causes but describes the move from day to night as a sequence of sense images, which Berkeley believed to be the stuff of scientific study (p. no). But, in the world of Godot, such regular and gradual changes are short-lived. Thus, as Pozzo exclaims, 26As Eyal Amiran finds, "epistemology precedes metaphysics: how we perceive deter mines what is" ("Figuring the Mind: Totality and Displacement in Beckett's Fiction," four nal of Beckett Studies, i [1992], 39).</page><page sequence="16">Berkeley Inside Out 545 the twilight abruptly?"pppfff!"?"comes to rest" as "night" suddenly "burst[s] upon us . . . pop! like that! . . . just when we least expect it" (pp. 25a-b). This disruption justifies Pozzo's caustic generalization, "That's how it is on this bitch of an earth." Correspondingly, Lucky provides haphazard insights into metaphysi cal matters that cannot be perceived by the senses. Although he appears onstage carrying Pozzo's bag, a matter of luck or chance reduced to de livering the baggage of possibility, "In reality," as Pozzo explains, "It's not his job" (p. 21a). Lucky's proper task should be to offer thoughts on "Beauty, grace, truth of the first water," thoughts that are otherwise "all beyond" Pozzo (p. 22b). Such conceptions are not Berkeleian ideas, which are always sense-dependent, but Berkeleian "notions," which come by intuition, both directly and upon "reflection and reasoning" (pp. 121-22, 183-84). For example, Lucky had taught Pozzo that "the tears of the world are a constant quantity" and that "our generation" is no "unhappier than its predecessors" (p. 22a). These bitter insights are gained not simply by observing humans cry but by thinking about the general implications of such particular instances of human suffering. Lucky also brings Pozzo and, by extension, Vladimir and Estragon, the notion that fortune and chance are in process and have changed: as Pozzo laments, Lucky used to be "so kind ... so helpful . . . and entertaining . . . my good angel. . . and now . . . he's killing me" (p. 23a). A "good angel" is not a heavenly being, but a beneficent extrahuman agent of destiny who mediates between the divine or cosmic and the hu man, guarding the latter from danger or failure. Ironically, Lucky ad vances only the impossibility of such mediation and protection. Scholars have long seen Lucky's "think" as a sardonic metaphysics, if not a theodicy.27 His diatribe emphasizes that a God-figure or cosmic per ceiver exists but fails to maintain the universe in full. Lucky's description of "a personal God" with a "white beard" who is also "outside time with out extension" joins popular images of God as a corporeal father-figure to philosophical and theological views of him as extratemporal and ex traspatial (p. 28b). These contradictory phrases agree in establishing, for the uneducated and the learned alike, that Lucky's universe is God created. But his three negative terms for the creator's involvement with his creation emphasize that God bears responsibility for the current state of the world. The first, "apathia," from the Stoic apatheia, signifies both indifference to the sufferings inflicted by fortune and liberation from any kind of emotion. The next, "athambia," denotes the lack of light or 27 For a lucid discussion of the ways that Lucky's speech also refutes the possibility of a Christian God, see Martin Esslin, The Theater of the Absurd, rev. ed. (Garden City, N.Y. : An chor Press, 1969), p. 35.</page><page sequence="17">546 Kroll clarity (the Greek verb thambeo means to dazzle). This term suggests a God-figure who functions in darkness and thus is incapable of perceiving the images in his own mind. The third, "aphasia," signifies the inability to understand or use the written or spoken word, making Lucky's God unable to grasp and sustain the ideas and images of human minds.28 Each of these terms implies a failure of perception. Lucky's delineation of the threefold attributes of God characterizes him not by specifying what he is not, as was traditional in medieval Christian theology, but rather by stipulating what he has become, a withdrawn cosmic mind whose love or regard comes "from the heights" of divine disinvolve ment. In this context, "dearly" suggests not an emotional but an eco nomic term?not fondly but at great expense?with the cost born by human beings. Central to Lucky's speech is his explicit designation of a philosopher who is somehow associated with a nontraditional view of God. In the French version, Beckett names Voltaire, who believed that God was a fic tion created by the human imagination (p. 61). As Stephani Pofahl Smith recognizes, Voltaire, having "cast out the idea of Providence," only "left a world governed by chance."29 This view reverses Berkeley's conviction that humans are the intentional product of God's mind as well as Beck ett's representation of chance as providential. The British text has Sam uel Johnson,30 who both agreed with and contravened Berkeley on sig nificant points. As Boswell recounted, he told Johnson that he believed Bishop Berkeley's arguments against the existence of matter, although false, to be irrefutable, at which the philosopher became so irritated that he kicked a rock and exclaimed, "I refute it thus. "31 Johnson himself posited both that the world is constituted of matter and, like Berkeley, "that all action originates in the mind."32 He also believed in Christian salvation, but this tenet was driven by his fear of "nothing and nothing ness," seen as "a fall into a void" (Temmer, pp. 90-91) or an ultimate abyss, not the kind of local gaps suggested in Godot. Not until the American text of Godot do we have Beckett's explicit 28 See Beryl and John Fletcher, Student's Guide to the Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1978), pp. 65-67, a valuable gloss on Beckett's obscure expressions. Yet, it some times gives only the general meaning of the terms (for example, athambia, defined as "imperturbability"). 29Smith, p. 900. 30Beckett, Samuel Beckett: The Complete Dramatic Works (London: Faber and Faber, 1986), p. 41. 31 Boswell's Life of Johnson, ed. Charles Grosvenor Osgood (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1945), p. 130. 32 Mark Temmer, Samuel Johnson and Three Infidels: Rousseau, Voltaire, Diderot (Athens: Univ. of Georgia Press, 1988), pp. 88-93.</page><page sequence="18">Berkeley Inside Out 547 reference to Berkeley?"the dead loss per head since the death of Bishop Berkeley" (p. 29a). This image links fortune directly to this phi losopher's vision of a metaphysical God-mind and mental universe, as if God attended fully to the images constituting the creation during Berkeley's lifetime and stopped doing so when he died. This possibility explains why Lucky reports the subsequent constriction of every human "head," the perceivable seat of human mental processes.33 The reduc tion is roughly quantifiable?"one inch four ounce per head approxi mately"?emphasizing that the place of the imagination has extension in space, since it is measurable, and in time, for "time will tell." Thus, Beckett emphasizes that images are the sole stuff of reality?"no matter what matter" (in the British and American texts) (pp. 29a-b). Beckett embeds Lucky's images of a dwindling "head" in a randomly ordered set of images manifesting the escalating uncertainty of for tune, images which make the universe a kind of cosmic gamble. The terms "Fulham" and "Clapham," repeated twice in four lines (p. 29a), are place names, but "Fulham" also means a loaded die (OED). This reiteration supports the notion not only that the tosses of fortune have somehow been fixed but also that chance and place are somehow linked. Indeed, Lucky emphasizes that at best humans can only study the sensory evidence of the "intermittent" and "unfinished" state of the world (p. 28b). In the French text, he assigns those engaged in such study to a place, "Berne en Bresse," an enigmatic phrase evok ing the alternating motion of flag-waving (berne) or blanket-tossing, which are conventional medieval and Renaissance metaphors for the swings of fortune (like "tennis"). Lucky's place-image in the British and American versions?"Essy-in-Possy"?suggests a Pozzo-like state of being-in-possibility. The scholars belong to "the Acacacacademy of Anthropopopometry" (p. 28b), a phrase that calls up ambiguous images of the human figure. Yet, instead of anthropomorphic, which means seeing human qualities or personality but not human form in something nonhuman or immaterial, Beckett coins the term, "anthropometry," which means measuring the ways in which something immaterial or nonhuman, like images and the world, resembles the human form. The interpolated syllables?"caca" and "popo" (childish terms for excre ment and chamberpot) ?also imply that the scatological has displaced the eschatological. In effect, luck or chance establishes that humans have been visibly diminished, becoming "man in short," limited in space, and "man in brief," limited in time. 33Although Amiran assumes that Beckett's head imagery is metaphoric, he recognizes that any differences between image and reality repeatedly seem to disappear (pp. 39-51).</page><page sequence="19">548 Kroll Lucky's "think" sputters out in vivid images presaging not the death but the intermittency of the universe: "alas alas abandoned unfinished ... in spite of the tennis . . . tennis . . . the stones ... so calm" and ending in a final repetition of "unfinished" (p. 29b). This juxtapo sition of images of tennis (reiterated) and a beard suggests that human fortune can, at least momentarily, touch God/Godot's head/mind and spark his attention. Meanwhile, the images of stones, conventionally sym bolic of the bottom level of materiality, imply that the sensory impres sions constituting reality have become barely mindful, with the mind at issue that of the cosmic perceiver. But the universe continues to oscillate between fullness and emptiness, never quite destined to approach ei ther, a universe "which even though intermittent" is "better than noth ing" (p. 28b). Perhaps because the action in the world of Godot is mental, many crit ics conclude that "nothing happens, twice." Yet the play's two-act struc ture is linear (like Berkeleian images of time and space), not cyclical. Even Vladimir's "dog" verses are only repeated once, and the second version is not exact. It gets stuck in a series of repetitions, which leave it neither finished nor abandoned, and is carved in stone (an echo of Lucky's stone-images) as a memorial "[f]or eyes of dogs to come" (p. 37a). So, the play's acts are parallel but different, with Vladimir and Estragon's encounters with Pozzo and Lucky offering fixes on fortune from dissimilar perspectives. In Act I, their meeting highlights the meta physics of the universe, most obviously in Lucky's explicit revelations about the unperceivable cosmic circumference and the growing disrup tion of the perceivable world. In Act II, the confrontation underscores the effects of such a metaphysics on human fortune, as Lucky unluckily "falls, drops everything and brings down Pozzo with him. They lie helpless among the scattered baggage" (p. 49b). For their part, Vladimir and Estragon must find the strength to prop up fortune, but cannot sustain its operations beyond their field of sight: Lucky and Pozzo collapse once again as soon as they move offstage (p. 57b). IV: HUMAN PERFORMANCE Vladimir and Estragon are not passive sufferers, but participate actively in the mental dynamics shaping and sustaining their own lives. In es sence, they are finite human spirits, not images; they are, like Berkeley's infinite spirit, active creators, not passive or inert. Grayling explains, "Berkeley takes it that the self of which we have direct intuitive knowl edge just is the spirit" (p. 159; see Berkeley, pp. 121,185). The role of finite</page><page sequence="20">Berkeley Inside Out 549 spirits encompasses acts of imagining (also like the infinite God-mind) as well as of intuiting and perceiving: "We don't manage too badly, eh Didi, between the two of us? . . . We always find something, eh Didi, to give us the impression we exist?" (p. 44b) The term "impression" (traces left on the mind or spirit by the sensory impact of the world or of other humans) echoes a major motif in Berkeley's argument, that perceptions of reality are "imprinted" or "impressed" by God on the human mind (pp. 77, 166, 197). Yet Vladimir and Estragon must supplement God/Go dot's diminished or sporadic regard with their perceptions of each other: they must "find" or perceive the "something." They also operate di rectly on their world: "Yes yes, we're magicians" (p. 44b). Vladimir and Estragon have had to become illusionists and sorcerers,34 with each not only functioning as a performer who entertains the other but also, in an older meaning of the word, as a conjurer who has at least some power or influence over the appearance, if not the reality, of the world. But in this play, performances are life-sustaining, and appearances are reality. The two humans keep each other alive by spending time, for example, in mocking each other's appearance, moving from such images as "Cere monious ape!" and "Punctilious pig!"?which suggest mental attitudes and activities?to "Cretin!"?which implies an inability to think and "Crritic!"?which implies the capacity to think either too much or too little (p. 48b). Although Vladimir and Estragon claim to be talking so that they "won't think," they know that this reason is an "excuse" and that they "think all the same" (pp. 4oa~4ia). For humans, imagining, intuiting, remembering, and perceiving re quire interacting with others, which explains why the play seems self reflexive. Godot becomes a play within a play within a play, as if its world were a music-hall stage on which Vladimir and Estragon act out their roles for the audience, for each other, and for Godot. But they are actors (and even playwrights), not just spectators. For example, having engaged in a mock separation, they decide to "make it up": "Come to my arms" and "My breast" (pp. 48b~49a). Their comically exaggerated embrace stems not from some sort of ambiguous sexual attraction but from a des perate need for life-sustaining perceptions. The hug supplements their visual perceptions of each other with tactile ones and strengthens their hold on existence. The phrase "make it up" also implies that such in teractions enable them, to some degree, to invent their world. Yet, as 34The word also echoes Beckett's claim that "involuntary memory is an unruly magician" which "chooses its own time and place for the performance of its miracle" (Proust, pp. 20 21). For Beckett as for Berkeley, memory is vital to sustain the time/space continuum (p. 162). As Vladimir exhorts Estragon in an attempt to relocate themselves in reality, "Try and remember" (p. 42b).</page><page sequence="21">550 Kroll humans, they remain limited, unable to make their world sufficiently co herent or full. Vladimir recalls a time when they saw themselves as worthy of being observed: "We were respectable in those days" (p. 7b). The word "respectable," like "species," derives from specere and means both worthy of regard and fit to be seen. Primarily because sense perceptions stop at the surfaces of things, Beckett approves "[r]eality, whether approached imaginatively or em pirically, [which] remains a surface, hermetic" (Proust, p. 56), This exte riority applies not only to the characters but also to destiny in Beckett's fictive worlds. As Ruby Cohn astutely concludes, Beckett's characters "possess a fierce and concrete individuality," but "have no character, if we demand the logical and psychological consistency of traditional drama."35 Estragon's seemingly arbitrary identification of Pozzo with Abel or Cain or both (p. 53b) does not evoke the importance of their inner moral natures but rather points to that of their outer perceivable appearance. Fortune requires every man to be his brother's keeper, not just by watching but, in George Martin's words, by "watching over" each other (p. 406). Vladimir's attention to Estragon, while he eats, sleeps, and dreams, has enabled his fellow human to endure: "When I think of it.. . all these years .. . but for me . . . where would you be . .. (Decisively. ) You'd be nothing more than a little heap of bones at the present minute, no doubt about it" (p. 7b). With Beckettian obliquity, this rhetorical as sertion underscores the saving operations of the perceiving mind. Seeking help with his task of sustaining the other, Vladimir turns to the Gospels, a traditional source of solace, but is not consoled. He broods over the accounts of the two thieves crucified with Christ?"One of the thieves was saved. (Pause.) It's a reasonable percentage" (p. 8b). Percentages are a matter of statistical or random probability?of Lucky like chance?not of a merciful response to thought or deeds. Vladimir's perception of written evidence reinforces his awareness that fortune is not shaped by divine intervention but by cosmic odds. But his human tendency, in Beckett's words, to apply a "figure to that which is ideal and invisible," by "incarnating the Idea [of things] in what" the typical hu man "conceives to be an appropriate paradigm" (Proust, p. 71) cannot sufficiently obscure the unsettling reality. Vladimir's attempt to find hope in eschatology succumbs to his and Estragon's sense that Christian doctrine misperceives the way the universe actually works. Iniquity is not the issue between humans and Godot. Hence, Estragon is thoroughly puzzled over Vladimir's "Suppose we repented," asking "[r]epented what," and answering intuitively, "Our being born?" (p. 8b). This last 35Cohn, Currents in Contemporary Drama (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1971), p. 187.</page><page sequence="22">Berkeley Inside Out 551 plays on Calderon's "Man's greatest sin is to have been born," which Beckett repeats in Proust (p. 49). But in Godot he omits "sin," the seven teenth-century Spanish dramatist-priest's key word. The omission shifts the thrust of Estragon's questions away from Adam and Eve's original sin to his and Vladimir's struggle to stay alive. Although Estragon does iden tify himself as "Adam" (p. 25a),36 he embodies the human archetype only in the music-hall ineptitude of his creative performance. Ironically, Vladimir's second try at finding the key to destiny in the scriptural story turns the accounts into a performance, as if only by ob serving can anyone, including the evangelists, see the truth of things: "And yet. . . (pause) . . . how is it?this is not boring you I hope?how is it that of the four Evangelists only one speaks of a thief being saved. The four of them were there?or thereabouts?and only one speaks of a thief being saved. . . . One out of four. Of the other three two don't mention any thieves at all and the third says that both of them abused him" (pp. 9a-b).37 As Louisa Jones recognizes, "Vladimir is obsessed with the truth of the witnesses' reports. Witness means existence: the thieves were real if observed by others, just as Vladimir remains real when Estragon watches and listens to him."38 But Vladimir's concern with the evangelists as part of the audience at the crucifixion also calls seeing into question: "Why believe him rather than the others?" (p. 9b). In Godot, perceiving becomes problematical when regarded as a way to achieve or understand salvation, but serves well when treated as a way to figure out life and death. Although Vladimir hopes that one of the two thieves was "saved," he corrects Estragon's "From hell?" with "Imbecile! From death." Lest the audience miss the shift from a Christian view of destiny as promising an afterlife to an ironic version of Berkeley's view of destiny as the continuity of living images, Beckett has Estragon reiter ate?"I thought you said hell"?and Vladimir repeat?"From death, from death" (p. 9b). This last becomes a categorical term for the loss not only of life but also of sensation and existence on earth. Death is as com plicated a condition as life. In a lyrical meditation on those who have lost the struggle to stay alive?on "[a] 11 the dead voices" which "make a noise like wings" or "leaves" or "sand"?Vladimir and Estragon ironi 36The French text has Catullus (born 84 BC), who, like Proust, wrote of a lady who had withdrawn her love. 37Tellingly, Vladimir's faulty recollection improves the odds. In Luke, when one of the two criminals "railed" at Christ and the other "rebuked" the first, "he [Christ] said to him, 'Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise' " (23.39-43). Matthew has: "The two robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him" (27. 44); Mark has: "Those who were crucified with him also reviled him" (15.32); and John has: "and with him two others, one on either side" (19.18). 38Jones, "Narrative Salvation in Waiting for Godot," Modern Drama, 17 (1974), 185.</page><page sequence="23">552 Kroll cally suggest that the difference between the living and the dead is a matter of audience. The dead "all speak at once," not to each other but "[e]ach one to itself" (p. 40b), so that death is a kind of solipsism?a state of self-perception. Very differently, to be alive is to have and to fos ter reality by perceiving and being perceived by someone else (perhaps why Beckett has the appropriately named Krapp interact with a tape of himself in an attempt to stave off the isolation of total self-perception). Thus Vladimir moves to escape the possibility of death by demanding that Estragon "Say something" to him, adding in desperation, "Say any thing at all! " (pp. 4ob~4ia). They need each other as actor and audience: as Vladimir " (gloomily) " fathoms early in the play, "It's too much for one man" (p. 7b). In dealing with fortune, Vladimir and Estragon come up against the limits of their natures and their world. They are specific individuals and also particular manifestations of the general fortune of humankind: as Vladimir pleads, "But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or not. ... we have kept our appointment. How many people can boast as much?" and Estragon replies succinctly, "Bil lions" (pp. 5ia-b). They remain particular individuals who fulfill the same responsibilities faced by humans in general. Unlike tigers who leap and prowl "without the least reflexion," humans think and rethink. When Vladimir contemplates posing, as if onstage, "with folded arms" and "weighfing] the pros and cons," he effectively plays out a version of Lucky's "think," verbalizing notions that he intuits and acting as "a credit" to his proper kind. As Vladimir's repetition of "species" empha sizes, moreover,-he and Estragon are mental images, destined to stay to gether and to continue to await Godot's regard: "in this immense con fusion one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come?" or "for night to fall," whichever might happen first. The reference to "night" again highlights the importance of light for perception and of perception for destiny, at least while possibility and chance allow. V: THE MOMENT OF PERCEPTION In Godot, Beckett's inversion of Berkeley's belief in God's perpetual re gard of the world culminates in two haunting visions of the shape of ex istence and of destiny. These parallel revelations highlight the critical correspondence and difference between Pozzo and Lucky as human for tune and Vladimir and Estragon as human beings. From Pozzo's perspec tive, fortune allows humans one Berkeleian moment charged by a brief flash of light that both permits and limits existence: "one day we were</page><page sequence="24">Berkeley Inside Out 553 born, one day we shall die, the same day, the same second .... They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more" (p. 57b). The light is the vital principle, since darkness makes perceiving impossible. Pozzo, however, can see both states, for the opera tions of destiny, whether as fortune or fate, encompass both being and nonbeing. Vladimir and Estragon's man's-eye view of destiny is far more bitter than Pozzo's because humans persist only in time, which prolongs their anguish: "Astride of a grave and a difficult birth. Down in the hole, lingeringly, the grave-digger puts on the forceps. We have time to grow old. The air is full of our cries" (pp. 58a-b). Ironically, death?"the grave-digger"?functions as the vital principle, for it pulls humans into life, where they engage in a losing struggle against Berkeleian nothing ness. Indeed, Vladimir speaks only of existence, for he and Estragon, unlike Pozzo, cannot perceive or imagine its opposite. Yet the two hu mans' acts of perceiving are a kind of victory, enabling them to recall and sustain the images that constitute their lives and their world, just as Beck ett's acts of imagining prevail over nothingness by constituting the worlds in his works.</page></plain_text>
