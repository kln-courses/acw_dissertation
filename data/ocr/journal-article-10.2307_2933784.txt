<plain_text><page sequence="1">The World as Text in Hardy's Fiction JONATHAN WIKE CN part 2 of The Return of the Native (1878), wejoin EustaciaVye in eaves- dropping on Thomasin Yeobright, her aunt, and her cousin Clym, who has just invaded Wessex as an earlier generation was ready for Napoleon to do, signaled by bonfires in the dark and surrounded by a romantic haze. Eustacia can hear all their words distinctly, but she is interested only in "the alternating voice that gave out about one-tenth of them," preferring the unsorted sensation of sound to its reduction to meaning. Most of Clym's utterance is very brief, though he makes one noteworthy observation, preserved most likely for being so antithetical to Eustacia's own distaste for Egdon Heath: "Once it [Clym's voice] surprised her notions by re- marking upon the friendliness and geniality written in the faces of the hills around."' The world as text in Hardy is a matter mainly of legible faces. There are many faces in landscapes, as in the "strange- eyed constellations" of "Drummer Hodge."2 And many of these have writing on them, one of the most extensive and suggestive instances being the "Cliff Without a Name" in A Pair of Blue Eyes (1873), from which Henry Knight reads the geological record of Lyell, Chambers, and Darwin as he dan- (? 1993 by The Regents of the University of California 1 Thomas Hardy, The Return of the Natzve (London: Macmillan, 1985), p. 123 (subsequent references are noted in the text). 2 The Complete Poetical Works of Thomas Hardy, ed.

Hardy does not use this\ figure haphaz- ardly; he is very consistent about how lines in the faces of the world form, about what they seem to mean, and about what the process of formation means. Usually the writing in his landscapes is engraved in them, in the rocks and the branch- ing limbs. The most impressive feature of such passages- and Hardy inscribes his landscapes in a wonderful variety of ways-is their ingenuity and accuracy as descriptions. Consid- ered in their total weight, however, these descriptions also show an imaginative connection between the process of writ- ing, which puts marks on a blank surface, and the process of weathering, which does something similar-both through digging or scratching or some other abrasion. But I will start with a passage that adds more to this foundation. Describing Eustacia's unhappiness with her surroundings, Hardy says that "there was no middle distance in her perspective: roman- tic recollections of sunny afternoons on an esplanade, with military bands, officers, and gallants around, stood like gilded letters upon the dark tablet of surrounding Egdon" (p. 83). First, the "dark tablet" points to something of the commonplace and scientific background to the idea of the world as text. But more importantly, this description sets up Egdon Heath as not just a written landscape but a secondary text in The Return of the Native. As this essay will show, the way in which this secondary reading of the landscape, or text inside the text, parallels our primary reading of the novel establishes writing metaphors as the central source of imag- ery in Hardy's natural descriptions and shows again the re- markable internal consistency of his artistic apprehension of the world. Like his character Grace Melbury in The Woodlanders (1887), Hardy was acquainted with phrenology.3 And if not their heads, people's faces at least are constantly being read in his works; he says of Clym Yeobright that "his counte- nance was overlaid with legible meanings" (p. 141). Another description of Clym links him directly with the heath: "The face was well shaped, even excellently. But the mind within 3 See Michael Millgate, Thomas Hardy: A Biography (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1982), p. 77; Thomas Hardy, The Woodlanders (London: Macmillan, 1975), p. 121.</page><page sequence="3">THE WORD AS TEXT IN HARDY 457 was beginning to use it as a mere waste tablet whereon to trace its idiosyncrasies as they developed themselves" (p. 140). This has a similar sound and, probably, source to the description of Eustacia and what she reads. Hardy's faces can make up another secondary text in his narratives, one in which his characters check each other's thoughts against their words. They manipulate the way this extra text is read; some of the most fascinating scenes of this kind take place in The Woodlanders, when Grace Fitzpiers reads her hus- band's infidelity in his face, and later when Giles Winter- borne carefully prevents Grace from reading the suffering in his. In European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages E. R. Curtius says that "the use of writing and the book in figurative language occurs in all periods of world literature, but with characteristic differences which are determined by the course of the culture in general."4 Writers have always had directly at hand one way of describing the workings of the world, through reference to the instruments and processes of writ- ing itself. And, at least since the Middle Ages, nature has been regarded as a book that, along with Holy Scripture, reveals God's intentions to men. Curtius traces this idea from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance: it "originated in pulpit elo- quence, was then adopted by medieval mystico-philosophical speculation, and finally passed into common usage" (p. 321). He leaves off tracing book metaphors in the eighteenth cen- tury because of two related events: the decay of the common- place tradition and the rise of printing. But the notion of a legible, meaningful world has still not died out, nor has the habit of drawing on the materials and processes of writing for ways of describing nature. In the nineteenth century the world as text is particularly important in American literature, pervading the work of Emerson, Hawthorne, and even Mark Twain, as well as in the literature of England. Hardy picks it up where Curtius leaves off, with Goethe, in connection with whom he makes this entry in his notebook: "The book of 4 Ernst Robert Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, trans. Wil- lard R. Trask (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1957), p. 303.</page><page sequence="4">458 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE Nature is after all the only one which has in every page impor- tant meanings."5 In his use of writing imagery Hardy makes an important link between old and new. He rehabilitates what had decayed from the commonplace tradition to an almost empty figure, a cliche, by reexamining all facets of its potential concreteness, as poets frequently do with such figures, and making it part of that "sensuous understanding" that D. H. Lawrence, in his Study of Thomas Hardy, says was "very great and deep, deeper than that, perhaps, of any other English novelist."6 The per- ception of something like writing in the landscapes he looked at, in the furrows of the fields, in the tangled branches of trees, was an uncanny, almost mystical sensation I believe must have been more than a mere figure of speech for Hardy. Nor were the implications this figure holds for the representa- tion of a world in the text lost on him. He was aware of, and exploited, the changes in textual dimension caused by refer- ences to writing contained in a piece of writing. Hardy's original configuration of the world as text through writing imagery is part of a search for meaning in the world. I do not mean this in the traditionally humanistic or human-interest way, as being a search for religious or metaphysical meaning, although that is certainly important for him. It is more like a search for immanent meaning, a wish to establish a discourse between subject and object, observer and landscape, that resolves into meaning much as does human communication. This is at least what we get if we take most of the scriptural metaphors seriously and at face value. To return to Clym Yeobright, Hardy says of him that "the observer's eye was arrested, not by his face as a picture, but by his face as a page; not by what it was, but by what it recorded. His features were attractive in the light of symbols, as sounds intrinsically common become attractive in lan- guage, and as shapes intrinsically simple become interesting 5 The Literary Notebooks of Thomas Hardy, ed.

"Not by what is was, but by what it recorded"-the face is the natural point of convergence of the symbolic and the existential, the meeting place of the man behind it and the world around it. These are the two texts Hardy creates in his narratives, one recording what a thing says ("Here come I, a Turkish Knight, / Who learnt in Turkish land to fight" [p. 138], as Eustacia says in the mum- mers' play in Return), the other what it is ("Thus Tess walks on; a figure which is part of the landscape; a fieldwoman pure and simple, in winter guise").7 The passage on Clym from The Return of the Native points to an essential purpose in Hardy's art, the subtraction of meaning from an otherwise chaotic profusion of sensations. The writing imagery forms only the most systematically realized part of a great dialogue between observer and land- scape, a large portion of which is a matter of sound. Readers will remember the beginning of Under the Greenwood Tree (1872): "To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree has its voice as well as its feature. At the passing of the breeze the fir-trees sob and moan no less distinctly than they rock; the holly whistles as it battles with itself; the ash hisses amid its quiverings; the beech rustles while its flat boughs rise and fall."8 These sound images form an auditory parallel to the writing images in many novels and poems. In a night scene in Return we are told that "it was possible to view by ear the features of the neighbourhood" and that "acoustic pictures were returned from the darkened scenery" (p. 97). The air forces through the branches of trees, like the "wind oozing thin though the thorn from norward" in the poem "The Voice" (II, 157). We should compare this effect with the scratching that produces the script in Hardy's landscapes. Sometimes the sky is the medium, and again trees are often the agents, as in the poem "The Prospect," where "the twigs of the birch imprint the December sky / Like branching veins upon a thin old hand" (III, 87). This is typical of dozens of natural descriptions in Hardy's verse and prose; he drew a 7 Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman (London: Macmillan, 1975), p. 304 (subse- quent references are noted in the text). 8 Under the Greenwood Tree (London: Macmillan, 1975), p. 32.</page><page sequence="6">460 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE particularly intricate version to go with "Her Death and Af- ter" in Wessex Poems, a crazy tangle of branches against a white background, so chaotic as to derive a sort of pattern from its chaos (fig. 1). Dennis Taylor has found in these patterns the "subtle signature" of Hardy's descriptions.9 Seeing a face in the landscape was instinctive for Hardy, and I do not think this is entirely due to his close association of particular people with particular places, though it is cer- tainly related. He once wrote in his notebook: "I cannot help noticing countenances and tempers in objects of scenery, e.g., trees, hills, houses."10 Hardy felt strongly that it was the hu- man figure that gave the landscape definition and made it meaningful; this may even account to some extent for the anthropomorphic images we find in The Return of the Native, The Dynasts (1904-8), "The Darkling Thrush," and so many other places. But going back to what he says of how "shapes intrinsically simple become interesting in writing," we can see that the idea of writing on a face or in the landscape gives Hardy a way of talking about just how sensations are received and reduced to meaning. To begin with, let us look at the even more fundamental patterns of imagery in Hardy, at a level that precedes any sort of formal or traditional determination. Clearly, light and dark are as important symbolically for him as they are for most other writers, but the more telling opposition in his natural images is that between haziness and clear definition. A description commonly begins out of focus and "monochro- matic" or "neutral"-Hardy has a favorite term, "Laodi- cean," -for this quality in human personalities-and then re- solves into sharp chiaroscuro. The way in which the opening of The Return of the Native proceeds from murky twilight to full darkness punctuated by signal fires to the silhouetted figure of Eustacia Vye nicely demonstrates the move from an inchoate landscape to one given human definition; it is fairly predictable. Sometimes Hardy adds one further step to this 9 Dennis Taylor, Hardy's Poetry, i860-I928 (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1981), P. 259. 10 Quoted in Gittings, Thomas Hardy's Later Years (Boston: Little, Brown, 1978), p. 90.</page><page sequence="7">THE WORD AS TEXT IN HARDY 461 FIG. 1.

And this extension can accompany a change in the human object's status in the two texts, symbolic and existential, often signaling that it has shifted entirely from being a fellow subjectivity in the scene to being a mere object opposite the observer, a perceptual change often associated with the death of the human figure. Writing is traditionally associated in the imagination with death, but Hardy is not just drawing on tradition; every as- pect of the writing metaphor proves to be an organic part of his habitual ways of perception. To demonstrate both the process of resolution and the association of writing with death, we should turn briefly to the poem "The Darkling Thrush" (I, 187-88), with its curi- ous interplay of presences, its guesses at meaning in the land- scape, and its dialectic of sound and writing images. It begins with the obscure "spectre-gray" frost, then moves to a more defined image in the "tangled bine-stems" that "scored the sky / Like strings of broken lyres," with multiple puns on</page><page sequence="8">462 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE "scored," including references to writing and music. This resolves further into a clearly outlined face in the landscape: "The land's sharp features seemed to be / The Century's corpse outleant." The predominant idea of the first half of the poem is, of course, death. When the song of the thrush breaks in to compete with the landscape's visual message, challenging the rigidity and stagnation there with its "ecstatic sound," all of this visual resolution into meaning is contained in one word, when the speaker says that "so little cause for carolings /... Was written on terrestrial things" (emphasis added). Hardy links writing and aging, a natural enough connec- tion, but one that points to others. One source of this figure is the tabula rasa of Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understand- ing, the blank tablet on which perceptions inscribe them- selves."I Hardy establishes the writing on the blank page of a person's face as a metaphor for the accumulation not just of perceptions, but also of suffering. Most important of all, this figure imposes a historical scheme on individual lives that parallels larger historical patterns, with inevitable conse- quences that all the rest of Hardy's writing must either refute or confirm. In both the man and the race, consciousness has become a burden. Many characters are, like Angel Clare in Tess of the d'Urbervilles ( 1887), "ill with thinking; eaten out with thinking, withered by thinking" (p. 268). In characters like Clym Yeobright, perceptions, both of the outside world and of one's own place in it, have crowded in at the expense of the will. And the same is true of modern times generally. Hardy says of Clym that "people already feel that a man who lives without disturbing a curve of feature or setting a mark of mental concern anywhere upon himself, is too far removed from modern perceptiveness to be a modern type" (p. 167). The fate of such characters is summed up in a well-known passage in The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), which remarks that "the ingenious machinery contrived by the Gods for re- ducing human possibilities of amelioration to a minimum ... I ISee John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, 2 vols. (New York: Dover, 1959), I, 121.</page><page sequence="9">THE WORD AS TEXT IN HARDY 463 arranges that wisdom to do shall come part passu with the departure of zest for doing." 12 Since Hardy is talking about the face and not the mind as his blank sheet, what is seen there has an added symbolic dimension. Though the lines on a face come from one's own thought, their testimony is more readily accessible to other people. In The Woodlanders Hardy makes this contact between world and soul entirely concrete: "Where the eyes of a multi- tude continuously beat like waves upon a countenance they seem to wear away its mobile power; but in the still water of privacy every feeling and sentiment unfolds in visible luxuri- ance, to be interpreted as readily as a printed word by an intruder" (p. 43). Here the face is like a monument worn down by centuries of hard weather, and is connected imagina- tively to the whole complex of faces, pictures, landscapes, monuments, and texts in Hardy. In the same way that it parallels the process of aging in characters, writing provides a metaphor for their existence in the world. Just as the world leaves its marks on them, their lives and deeds are inscribed in a great "Scroll" or "Web," the world-text that is most fully elaborated in the brain of the Immanent Will in The Dynasts. Many of Hardy's characters' pleas for unconsciousness or nonexistence are expressed as a desire to be removed from this record. This is the sad motive of Michael Henchard in his will (Mayor of Casterbridge, p. 85) and of Tess in the poem "Tess' Lament," which concludes with the lines: "I cannot bear my fate as writ, / I'd have my life unbe; / Would turn my memory to a blot, / Make every relic of me rot, / My doings be as they were not, / And leave no trace of me!" (I, 217). The connection this figure makes between writing and presence is very important for one of the central functions of all of Hardy's works, which is to stand as monuments to peo- ple and moments that are past; and we have been seeing how these faces in landscapes gradually resolve themselves from unsorted sensations into pictures and then into texts that serve as monuments. A peculiar principle, which pertains to 12 The Mayor of Casterbridge (London: Macmillan, 1975), p. 274.</page><page sequence="10">464 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE much memorial writing and to sentimental expression gener- ally, governs Hardy's largely epitaphic writing, especially in verse. As his presence in the world diminishes, the departed one's presence in the recording text, the poem, advances. This conservation of presence between text and world may be inevitable in this kind of writing, but Hardy is unusually consistent in the way he manages to describe the object's transformation in both places, his corresponding inscription and erasure. This has partly to do, again, with the creation of two "texts" inside the thing we read, one of which speaks to the symbolic nature of a character or thing, the other to its existence. The writing of history and the history of writing are inextricably interwoven. Indeed, for Hegel there is no his- tory without writing. "The periods," he says, "which peoples have passed before the writing of history, may have been filled with revolutions, migrations, the wildest transforma- tions. Yet, they are without objective history because they lack subjective history, records of history."''3 The very develop- ment of writing skews our perception of history in a pro- found way. It naturally seems to accompany the growth of historical consciousness and to focus attention on writing's beginnings as different from time's beginnings, both in broad and narrow time frames. It creates an obsession with writing itself and its association with displacement and death, along with a desire to make the text take on some of the concreteness of the world it represents. I do not wish here to force on Hardy any more systematic philosophy of history than the one just briefly sketched, in which a surfeit of con- sciousness is reached by a corresponding loss of will and free- dom, but only to point out the imaginative consistency of his realization of it at all levels, especially in his basic descrip- tions. The most apparently tossed-off matters in Hardy are always painstakingly justified. At one point in The Return of the Native Hardy reverses his scriptural imagery. Diggory Venn is looking over a letter 13 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Reason in History: A General Introduction to the Philosophy of History, trans. Robert S. Hartman (New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1953), p. 76.</page><page sequence="11">THE WORD AS TEXT IN HARDY 465 from Thomasin Yeobright, one he has read and reread so often that now "the black strokes of writing thereon looked like the twigs of a winter hedge against a vermilion sunset" (p. 92). Again we have an engraved sky, but this is also an instance of the text as world. This description oscillates be- tween two tendencies, one speaking of a written landscape, the other borrowing from natural terminology to describe writing itself. Venn's letter is an ad hoc reversal, but several other such borrowings are part of a long tradition. For a long time, language has had to shift some terms from other areas to accommodate the act and substance of writing, which is still a relatively new development in human experience. The word "book," for example, still preserves the importance of trees in the written language of northern Europe; the Indo-European root is a word meaning "beech tree." The names of letters of the Runic alphabet were taken from names of trees, and in The White Goddess Robert Graves, outlining the background to Taliesin's "The Battle of the Trees," shows how tree alphabets held together whole sys- tems of myth and ritual.'4 Agricultural motifs appear in La- tin and Greek in a similar way. "Boustrophedon," or "turning like an ox,"'5 puts the system of alternating left-to-right and right-to-left script in terms of an everyday activity, and this idea continues in the Latin "versus," from which the English "verse" derives. Besides this relation of writing to such rustic activities as woodcutting and plowing, a more cultured pasto- ral tradition sees the production of writing as flowers and their reception as flower gathering, giving us the word "an- thology," for example. One of Hardy's most beautiful poems, "During Wind and Rain," ends with the line, "Down their carved names the rain- drop ploughs" (II, 240). If we follow these images closely, several references to writing emerge, in the carved names, in the plowing; this is writing on top of writing. Hardy is always interested in engraved things and in graves; the two words are related to each other and to the Greek "graphein," the source 14 See The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth, amended ed. (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1966), pp. 165-204. 15 American Heritage Dictionary, s.v. "boustrophedon."</page><page sequence="12">466 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE of many words in English. The word "write" itself carries the idea of incision; it comes from "Germanic writan . . . to tear, scratch."''6 Writing is usually conceived of as entirely abstract and without dimension, a purely unmotivated reflection of thought, but all this serves to underscore its materially deter- mined aspects- the very shapes of the letters in any alphabet are far from accidental-and to show further the organic strength of Hardy's writing metaphors. Hardy fits neatly into the tradition of using natural im- ages to describe writing, but all of this would not matter so much if it did not point to ways of reading those of his landscape descriptions in which writing imagery is less overt. To illustrate an intermediate step we might take, I would like to look at a passage from an early chapter in Jude the Obscure (1896), in which Hardy describes a field at Marygreen: The fresh harrow-lines seemed to stretch like the channellings in a piece of new corduroy, lending a meanly utilitarian air to the expanse, taking away its gradations, and depriving it of all history beyond that of the few recent months, though to every clod and stone there really attached associations enough and to spare- echoes of songs from ancient harvest-days, of spoken words, and of sturdy deeds.'7 In these "harrow-lines" we should see history as a palimpsest in the landscape, of which only the latest superficial layer still contains any meaning for the characters who look at it, leav- ing modern people alienated from the past. The past and memory are spatially represented in Hardy; throughout his novels he creates charged monumental spots at which mod- ern events take place before a backdrop layered by ancient events. This passage, coming at the end of his novel writing, now hides this great unconscious record from his characters, preserving it for the privileged reader, emptying it into the monument of the text. In Tess of the d'Urbervilles and especially Jude the Obscure, i6 American Heritage Dictionary, s.v. "write." 17 Jude the Obscure (London: Macmillan, 1975), p. 38 (subsequent references are noted in the text).</page><page sequence="13">THE WORD AS TEXT IN HARDY 467 there is less and less of the dialogue between observer and landscape. The sympathetic voice of the wind heard in Under the Greenwood Tree and The Woodlanders has faded, and along with it the possibility of such sympathy. We are living increas- ingly in the world of the text and a world of texts, the world itself becoming more and more remote. Again, with Hardy's need to make things concrete and external, all this happens inside the narrative, in the words and in what they describe. Put another way, this emptying of the real into its representa- tion confronts the characters much as it confronts us. Tess and Jude read actual messages in the landscape. Tess, for example, has two run-ins with an ominous sign-painter, whose messages contain meaning without intention. He is lettering bits of Bible verses onto boards: THY, DAMNATION, SLUMBERETH, NOT 2 Pet. II 3 and THOU, SHALT, NOT, COMMIT- (pp. 108-9) The red that Tess's sign painter uses reminds us of Diggory Venn, also a wanderer associated with weird fatality. The commas suggest a nearly illiterate copyist. This character has a strange affinity, even an identity, with the Immanent Will of The Dynasts, who "works unconsciously ... / Eternal artistries in Circumstance, / Whose patterns, wrought by rapt aesthetic rote, / Seem in themselves Its single listless aim, / And not their consequence." i8 The Dynasts records an attempt to connect particularized meaning-both the verses Tess reads have an obvious, bur- densome significance to her-with general consciousness. Jude the Obscure brings us even more into the text as world. Jude reads buildings and people en masse, not faces and landscapes. Few Hardy works are so divorced from the countryside. Christminster is "that ecclesiastical romance in i8 The Dynasts (London: Macmillan, 1978), p. 1 (subsequent references are noted in the text).</page><page sequence="14">468 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE stone," from whose "numberless architectural pages" (p. 58) Jude reads, just as he reads its "town life" as "a book of humanity" (p. 139). Earlier in the novel, on his way finally to Christminster, Jude reads a piece of his own handiwork in the landscape; "he remembered that once on his way home he had proudly cut with his keen new chisel an inscription on the back of [the] milestone, embodying his aspirations. It had been done in the first week of his apprenticeship, before he had been diverted from his purposes by an unsuitable woman" (pp. 96-97). This writing becomes an instrument of fatality to Jude, a moment of intention frozen into an emblem of his acceptance of repetition and misery. It is also a wonderful typographical moment in the book. The hand is a printer's dingbat (fig. 2); someone planning a new edition of Jude could choose a slightly different hand. It is somewhere be- tween typography and clip-art, and as such it has a conven- tional meaning; in this place in Jude it also has a striking representational quality. Here manifestations of the world as text, originating in writing imagery, are interrupting the book text itself. Such a moment both pierces and anchors the text, I believe. That it so strongly answers an urge to repre- sent, to return to the reality of the world the text re-creates, balances the way it reminds us of this inexorable emptying of world into text. It fixes a kind of limit. The notion of reading the world continues in Hardy's poetry and, especially, in The Dynasts. More, probably, than any other character, Napoleon is aware of his cosmic situa- tion, as the meaning-ridden landscape of Hardy's novels ex- pands in the epic-drama to a world-text.. In a conceit that turns phrenology inside out, the Phantom Intelligences read the brain of the Immanent Will. Napoleon shares their read- ing of historical meaning; he raises his head briefly above the world's confusion to see his place in its design. He is even credited with unnatural influence over the Immanent Will, and toward Waterloo he attains this view: "History makes use of me to weave her web / To her long while aforetime-figured mesh / And contemplated charactery: no more" (p. 449). Napoleon is one of Hegel's "world-historical individuals," "fortunate in being the agents of a purpose which constitutes</page><page sequence="15">THE WORD AS TEXT IN HARDY 469 FIG. 2. FROM JUDE THE OBSCURE (LONDON: MACMILLAN, 1975), P. 97. a step in the progress of the universal Spirit," but "not what is commonly called happy" (Reason in History, p. 41). As Napo- leon's demise approaches in part 3, Hardy uses a visual tech- nique to foreshadow his change from being a reader to being part of the unconscious design. There is an "extreme picto- rial reduction," the technique Tony Tanner finds "right at the heart of Hardy's vision,"'9 as Napoleon's figure is seen "di- minished to the aspect of a doll" (p. 450), a shift of a kind often associated in Hardy with death. He is reduced in es- sence to a mere object. Napoleon's recognition of his place in the web of the Immanent Will shows all the weariness and resignation we can expect such knowledge to bring; his life pattern recapitulates those' of Hardy's other characters who are overburdened with consciousness. In this Napoleon is contrasted with Wellington, in whom will and idea are at one: a later stage direction tells how "the web connecting all the apparently separate shapes includes WELLINGTON in its tissue with the rest, and shows him, like them, as acting while discover- ing his intention to act" (p. 68o; emphasis added). Napoleon has been a reader of the landscape, but now he has been "writ- ten" into it; Wellington is always, as was said of Tess, a "figure which is part of the landscape." Hardy carefully reduces a pictorial representation to a set of references to writing, collapsing world into text. Earlier I mentioned the cliff scene in A Pair of Blue Eyes and quoted a passage about Eustacia Vye in The Return of the Native: "There was no middle distance in her perspective." The reduction of a range of sensations to a cluster of writing images produces 19 Tony Tanner, "Colour and Movement in Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervzlles," Criti- cal Quarterly, 1 o (1968), 2 3 2.</page><page sequence="16">470 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE *~~~~~~~~. . .. tal FIG. 3. FROM THE COMPLETE POETICAL WORKS OF THOMAS HARDY (OXFORD: CLARENDON PRESS, 1982) I, 92. just such a picture without a "middle distance," in which the uppermost layer is simply laid over the bottom layer or ground. The cliff scene shows again how Hardy connects the scheme of writing images with time. Knight looks directly at the earliest stratum of the geological record, the bottom sur- face of the legible face in the landscape: "Time closed up like a fan before him."20 To go with this reduction in perspective, the colors in this scene, which takes place in broad daylight, all filter out to black and white. Here Knight sees the present superimposed on the deep past. Often in Hardy, however, the opposite happens; characters commonly reach their mem- ories through a kind of trance in which they read past sensa- tions like pictures laid over present scenes. A wonderful and very useful example is the poem "In Front of the Land- scape," the first poem in Satires of Circumstance. Or we can look back at the description of Eustacia, in which her memo- ries of Budmouth "stood like gilded letters upon the dark tablet of surrounding Egdon" (p. 83). If writing images are not at the exact center of Hardy's natural descriptions, they are at least very close, for Hardy is connecting the act of reading with the apprehension of the poetic image generally. The poetic image stands out "like gilded letters" from the "dark tablet" of its own "surround- ing Egdon." We should think of the outdoor readings of the 20 A Pair of Blue Eyes (London: Macmillan, 1975), p. 222.</page><page sequence="17">THE WORD AS TEXT IN HARDY 471 boy Thomas Hardy2l or of his re-creation in Jude Fawley, reading as he drives his aunt's bakery cart (pp. 56-57). A layer of meaning constantly detaches itself from a back- ground of sensation, a layer of memory from the back- ground of the present. The world is constantly moving into the text we hold up in front of it. Indeed, in all full, discrete moments of our apprehension of nature, objects stand out from their surroundings-as in the poetic image, but in a way not peculiar to it. We are all readers of the world, and for illustration I refer you to the drawing that accompanies "In a Eweleaze near Weatherbury" in Wessex Poems (fig. 3), which shows giant spectacles through which we can read the world or, possibly, the world can read us.
