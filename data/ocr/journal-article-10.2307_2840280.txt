Ifli Thie varying forms of the handles of pudding-knives from the Banks group HUIP are evidently all derived from the same source. Without doubt the (lesian is anthro- pomorphic. Absolute proof of this, however, was wanting until, through the kindness of Dr. Cod- rington, I became possessed of a knife the handle of which was carved to represent a complete male human figure (No. 3). In comparing this specimen with others from the British Museuim the anthropomorphic design is at once apparent. Dr. Cod- rington tells me that the native name of this implement is " igot." My specimen (No. 3) is made of reddish-brown wood and measures 161 inches in length and is much more highlly finished than is usually the case with this type of implement. Dr. Codrington says that the bread-fruit is abundant in the Banks Islands, where it forms an important part of the food supply when dried over a fire, wound round witlh strips of leaves and preserved in chests. The figures in the illustra- tion are one quarter the size of the originals. J. EDGE-PARTINGTON.</page></plain_text>
