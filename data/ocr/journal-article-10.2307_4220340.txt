In 1939, an experiment was established on the Jornada Experimental Range to evaluate the effects of shrub removal, rabbit exclusion, furrowing, and seeding in creosotebush [Larrea tridentata (DC.) Cov] vegeta- tion. Sixteen plots (21.3 x 21.3 m) were laid out in four rows of four plots per row with a buffer zone of 7.6 m between plots and rows. A barbed wire fence excluded cattle and poultry wire fencing excluded lagomorphs. Treatments were factorially applied at two levels. Plant cover in the plots was sampled in 1938 (before treat- ment), 1947, 1956, 1960, 1967 and 1989 with randomly located, line-intercept transects. Data from all sampling dates were analyzed as a split plot in time and main effects for 1989 tested by analysis of variance for a 2 ? 4 factorial experiment. There were significant (P&lt;0A0) year ? treatment interactions. Seeding and furrowing treatments were ineffective but lagomorph exclusion and shrub clearing treatments resulted in significant treat- ment differences for several species. In 1989, basal area of spike dropseed (Sporobolus contractus A.S. Hitchc.) was 30-fold greater on the lagomorph excluded than on the lagomorph unexcluded treatment. Canopy cover of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr. var. glan- dulosa), tarbush (Flourensia cernua DC.) and mariola (Parthenium incanum H.B.K.) were affected by lago- morph exclusion. None of the responses were viewed as successional in nature. They principally represented in- dividual species sensitivities to either absence of a pri- mary herbivore or removal of aboveground shrub bio- mass. Though the physical treatments could be regarded as relatively severe disturbances of the system, the im- pacts on community vegetation dynamics were relatively insignificant.

Gibbens Lagomorphs are among the most widely distributed na- tive herbivores in North America and the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) is found throughout western rangelands (Hall and Kelson 1959; Hansen and Flinders 1969). The diets of black-tailed and other jack- rabbits have been studied extensively, in part because of their potential competition with domestic livestock for forage resources. Jackrabbits eat a wide variety of plants, primarily grasses and forbs in spring and summer and woody plants in fall and winter (Vorhies and Taylor 1933; Riegel 1942; Brown 1947; Bear and Hansen 1966; Currie and Goodwin 1966; Hayden 1966; Fagerstone et al. 1980; Westoby 1980; Dabo et al. 1982). Several stud- ies have shown considerable dietary overlap of livestock and jackrabbits (Hansen and Flinders 1969; Sparks 1968 ; Schneberger 1990). Jackrabbit diets are determined largely by what is available in their feeding areas but they do graze selectively and utilize plants in proportions widely different from their relative availability (Uresk 1978; Sparks 1968; Johnson and Anderson 1984). The combined herbivory of jackrabbits and rodents can ef- fectively prevent improvement of deteriorated arid rangelands (Norris 1950). In 1938 and 1939, an experiment was established by U.S. Forest Service personnel on the Jornada Experi- mental Range to evaluate the effects of shrub removal, lagomorph exclusion, furrowing, and seeding in areas dominated by creosotebush [Larrea tridentata (DC.) Cov]. At one of three replicates the lagomorph exclusion fences withstood the vicissitudes of time and provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the long-term effects of lagomorph exclusion, principally black-tailed jackrab- bits, although desert cottontails (Sylvilagus audubonii) may have foraged in the area as well. Materials and methods This study was conducted on the Jornada Experimental Range 37 km north of Las Cruces, New Mexico (Lat. 32?37' N, Long. 106?40/ W). The study area is located on a bajada slope of the San</page><page sequence="2">211 Table 1.

Study plots are located on a ridgetop where loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, thermic, shallow, Typic Paleorthid soils (Tencee series) have formed on an old alluvial fan (Neher and Bailey 1976). Long-term annual pre- cipitation (1922-1990) at the nearest rain gauge (1.7 km distant at an elevation of 1,585 m) is 257 mm. Summer precipitation is mostly from high intensity, short duration, convective storms covering small areas and 55% of total precipitation occurs in July, August and September. Winter precipitation comes from low intensity frontal storms covering broad areas. Snow is infrequent. The frost- free period averages 200 days, but the effective growing season, when soil water and temperature are favorable, is often 90 days or less (Paulsen and Ares 1962). The vegetation is dominated by creosotebush with honey mes- quite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr. var. glandulosa) and tarbush (Flourensia cernua DC.) also present. Suffrutescents, including ma- n?la (Parthenium incanum H.B.K.), broom snakeweed [Gutierrezia sarothrae (Pursh) Britt &amp; Rusby], and desert zinnia [Zinnia acerosa (DC.) Gray], are abundant. Principal perennial grasses are bush muhly (Muhlenbergia porteri Scribn.), spike dropseed (Sporobolus contractus A.S.Hitchc), fluffgrass [Erioneuron pulchellum (H.B.K.) Tatoka], and black grama [Bouteloua eriopoda (Torr.) Torr.]. In 1938, sixteen plots (21.3 ? 21.3 m) were established in four rows of four plots with a buffer zone of 7.6 m between plots. Treatments (clearing, lagomorph exclusion, furrowing, and seed- ing) were factorially applied, yielding a check plot, four single factor plots, and 11 plots with varying degrees of interaction (Table 1). The clearing, furrowing, and seeding treatments were applied in 1938 but the lagomorph exclusion fences were not constructed until 1939. Poultry netting with a 2.5 cm mesh buried about 15 cm in the ground and extending above ground about 75 cm was used to exclude lagomorphs. The furrowing treatment consisted of shallow, handraked furrows designed to trap surface runoff water. A barbed- wire fence excluded cattle from all plots. All the plots were sampled in 1938 before the treatments were applied. Each plot was divided into east and west halves and 14, randomly located 10.65 m line- intercept transects sampled for shrub canopy cover and grass basal area in each half-plot. Following the same procedures, with a new set of random line locations each time, the plots were resampled in 1947, 1956, 1960, 1967, and 1989. Shrubs (not including suffrutes- cents) were removed from the cleared plots following the 1947, 1956, 1960, and 1967 samplings. Some creosotebush plants may have been left on the cleared plots in 1960 and 1967 for age-growth studies. In 1938, the seeding treatment plots were seeded with a mixture of black grama, spike dropseed, mesa dropseed [Sporobolus flexuosus (Thurb.) Rydb.], and four-wing saltbush [Atriplex cane- scens (Pursh) Nutt.] Some of the seeding treatment plots were reseeded in 1947. Effects of lagomorph exclusion, shrub removal, seeding and furrowing on canopy cover of shrubs and basal area of grasses were tested by Analysis of Variance (SAS 1990) for a split plot in time experimental design. The mixed model included fixed main effects and year as a random split effect. Main effects and two-way interac- tions were tested using pooled higher level interactions. Year effects and year ? main effect interactions were tested using year ? higher- level interactions. Main effects fifty-one years post-treatment were tested by Analysis of Variance (SAS 1990) for a 2x4 factorial experiment. Main effects and two-way interactions were tested using pooled high level interactions. Means within a significant treatment were separated using least significant difference (P&lt;0.10). All analyses were performed with the data in number of basic measurement units (3 mm) and then means converted to percentages. Relationships between rainfall and total shrub canopy cover and total grass basal area were determined. Correlation coefficients were calculated for canopy cover and basal area and rainfall for the month preceding sampling, for the first plus the second month preceding sampling, etc., until 24 months of antecedent rainfall had been accumulated. Results Annual precipitation during the 51-year period was ex- tremely variable (Fig. 1). During the 1937 to 1989 period, 32 years had below average annual precipitation and 28 years below average July, August and September pre- cipitation. Correlations of shrub canopy cover and grass basal area with accumulated antecedent rainfall revealed that correlations fell sharply after 10 antecedent months (Fig. 2). Grasses had higher r values than shrubs during the year of sampling but shrubs maintained higher r values than grasses with increasing antecedent periods. Because only six sample points out of 52 are available, these data must be viewed with caution. The analysis of variance for a split plot in time re- vealed that several shrub and grass species had significant (P&lt;0.10) year x treatment interactions for the lago- morph exclusion and shrub clearing treatments. Only two shrub species had significant year ? treatment in- teractions for the seeding and furrowing treatments and data for these treatments will not be presented. Results were similar to those of Korzdorfer (1968) who analyzed the 1938, 1947, 1956, 1960 and 1967 data using a mixed model, with years random and treatments fixed. In 1938, the pre-treatment shrub canopy cover aver- aged 24% with a range among plots of 15-30%. Creo- sotebush predominated, with canopy cover ranging from 9 to 24% among plots and an average of 18% over all plots. Mesquite and tarbush occurred on all plots with canopy cover ranging from 0.1 to 5% and 0.7 to 5%, respectfully. There were no differences between creosotebush can- opy cover on the lagomorph excluded and unexcluded treatments in 1938 (Fig. 3A). However, by 1947 creo- sotebush canopy cover was significantly greater on the excluded than on the unexcluded treatment and canopy</page><page sequence="3">212 200 100 1940 1980 1990 Fig. 1.

Correlation coefficients (r) for total grass (?) basal area and total shrub (v) canopy cover with months of accumulated antecedent precipitation cover remained higher on the excluded treatment at each later sampling date (Fig. 3A). There was a significant decline in creosotebush canopy cover from 1938 to 1989 with the excluded and unexcluded treatments showing a similar pattern (Fig. 3A). As expected, there were signifi- cant differences in creosote bush canopy cover between the cleared and uncleared treatments from 1947 to 1989. Across year differences of creosotebush canopy cover for the uncleared treatment varied somewhat from that of the lagomorph treatments but 1989 canopy cover was significantly less than in 1938 (Fig. 3A). Creosotebush reestablished as the dominant shrub after each clearing of the plots, making up 57, 66, 74 and 56% of total shrub cover in 1947, 1956, 1960 and 1967, respectfully. In 1989, when suffrutescents were more abundant than in prior years, creosotebush made up 35% of total shrub cover on the cleared plots. Mesquite canopy cover was significantly higher on the lagomorph excluded than on the unexcluded treatment in 1947 and later sampling years (Fig. 3B) Mesquite canopy cover was significantly higher in 1947 and 1989 than in 1938 on the lagomorph excluded treatment (Fig. 3B). However, on the lagomorph unexcluded treat- ment, mesquite canopy cover was significantly lower than in 1938 at all sampling dates. Mesquite canopy cover was significantly less on the cleared than on the uncleared treatment in 1938 and the clearing treatment increased this difference. The gravelly soil and alluvial fan characteristics of the study site provide scattered suitable microsites for mesquite (and tar bush). Differ- ences in canopy cover for plots in 1938, prior to treat- ment, reflect this site heterogeneity. Among-year differ- ences for the uncleared treatment were very similar to the lagomorph excluded treatment with mesquite canopy cover in 1947 and 1989 being significantly higher than in 1938 (Fig. 3B). There were no significant differences between the ex- cluded and unexcluded lagomorph treatments for tar- bush canopy cover (Fig. 3C). Among year differences were significant for the lagomorph treatments with a sharp decline in cover from 1938 to 1960 and only partial recovery by 1989. There was a significant difference in tarbush canopy cover in 1938 on the shrub clearing treatments and shrub clearing reduced tarbush canopy cover to very low levels in later years (Fig. 3C). Differ- ences in tarbush canopy cover among years for the un- cleared treatment followed the same pattern as in the lagomorph treatments. Mariola had very low canopy cover in 1938 and a sig- nificant difference was not found between lagomorph excluded and unexcluded treatments until 1989 (Fig. 3D). Mariola was not cleared from the plots but significant differences in cover on cleared and uncleared treatments occurred in 1947, 1967 and 1989. Both cleared and uncleared treatments had a large increase in mariola canopy cover from 1967 to 1989 (Fig. 3D). In 1938, perennial grass basal area averaged 2.9% over all plots. Bush muhly was most abundant, with an overall average basal area of 2.3% and a range among plots of 0.5 to 5.2%. Fluffgrass occurred on all plots but maxi- mum basal area was only 0.7%. Black grama was present on 14 of the 16 plots with a maximum basal area of 0.8%.</page><page sequence="4">20 15 10 0 20 15 - 10 - Creosotebush ?

There were no significant differences in black grama basal area between lagomorph excluded and unexcluded treatments at any sampling date (Fig. 4A). On the shrub cleared and uncleared treatments there was a significant difference in black grama basal area only in 1989. Only the lagomorph excluded and shrubs cleared treatments showed a significant increase in black grama basal area in 1989 when compared to previous years. Spike dropseed was present on all treatments in 1947 and later sampling years.

Bush muhly, the most abundant grass, did not have any significant differences between lagomorph ex- cluded and unexcluded treatments (Fig. 4C). On the clearing treatments significant differences in bush muhly basal area were found only in 1957 and 1989. Bush muhly basal area varied widely among years on both lagomorph and shrub clearing treatments with lows in 1947, 1960 and 1967 and highs in 1938, 1957 and 1989.

Fluffgrass basal area was significantly greater on the shrub cleared than on the uncleared treatment in 1938 and remained higher on the cleared treatment with differences being significant in 1957 and 1960. Among year fluctuations of fluffgrass and bush muhly are similar (Fig. 4C, 4D). Factorial analysis of the 1989 data revealed very few significant treatment interactions. Among shrubs only mesquite (cleared ? furrowed, seeded ? furrowed) and tarbush (cleared ? seeded) had significant treatment interactions (Table 2). Among grasses only spike drop- seed (excluded ? cleared) and fluffgrass (excluded ? seeded) had significant treatment interactions. Except for the excluded cleared interaction for spike dropseed it is difficult to accept the interactions as due to actual treat- ment effects. More likely they result from inherent dif- ferences in species cover among the plots. Mesquite, tarbush, and mariola had significant dif- ferences in canopy cover between the lagomorph ex- cluded and unexcluded treatments (Table 2). Among grasses, only spike dropseed and fluffgrass showed sig- nificant differences for the lagomorph treatments. Can- opy cover for the shrubs periodically cleared, creo- sotebush, mesquite and tarbush, differed between cleared and non-cleared treatments. However, mariola, which was not cleared, had a significantly higher canopy cover on the cleared than on the uncleared treatment (Table 2). This indicates mariola may have benefitted from reduced shrub competition. Black grama and spike dropseed had significantly higher basal area on the cleared than on the uncleared treatment. Only mesquite, tarbush and fluff- grass had significant differences between the seeded and unseeded treatments and these differences are not be- lieved to reflect a treatment effect (Table 2). The same is true for the difference between furrowed and unfurrowed treatments for mesquite canopy cover. Desert zinnia was present in 1989 but had not been recorded in previous years. It occurred on 13 of the 16 plots and had an average canopy cover of 1 %. There was some question whether it would have been recorded in samples taken before 1989. However, it did not appear in any of an extensive series of photographs of each plot taken in 1967. Perennial grass basal area was higher in 1989 than during previous sample years. However, there was ev- idence in the form of recently dead crowns of spike dropseed, black grama, bush muhly, and fluffgrass that the low rainfall in 1977 and 1978 had affected perennial grass populations. It was estimated that about 90% of the fluffgrass plants encountered when sampling in 1989 were dead. Discussion Rangelands of the northern Chihuahuan Desert changed substantially during the previous 120 years. A primary transition has been replacement of perennial warm sea- son grasslands by shrub dominated states. These vegeta- tive transitions have been driven by a combination of natural and anthropomorphic disturbances (Buff?ngton and Herbei 1965). The result is a desert that is charac- terized by increasingly heterogenous distribution of lim- ited resources. Schlesinger et al. (1990) described this phenomena as desertification that resulted in areas of resource accumulations best characterized as islands of fertility. It has been proposed that processes which spati- ally concentrate resources, particularly of limiting nu- trients such as nitrogen, are self-augmenting (Westoby et al. 1989). Current shrubland states, including those</page><page sequence="7">216 dominated by creosotebush, are viewed as permanent without considerable intervention (Friedel 1991). Our study was initiated in 1938 on a site that had already been converted to a self-augmenting shrubland state. Our in- terpretations of these data support hypotheses of stable shrubland states as a function of heterogenous resource distribution. Interpretation of these data is difficult because of the number of important but uncontrolled variables, par- ticularly precipitation and lagomorph population den- sities. Precipitation patterns are crucial to the expression of community structure in arid environments (Noy-Meir 1973; Laycock 1991) This study, with only six, widely separated yearly sampling points does not permit a difi- nitive evaluation of precipitation influences. Probably the low levels of shrub canopy cover and perennial grass basal area in 1957 and 1960 result from the severe drought of the early 1950's which had a great impact on vegetation in the Jornada Basin (Herbei et al. 1972). It is also likely the high cover values found in 1989 reflect the mostly above average precipitation of the 1980's. The appearance of desert zinnia on the plots between 1967 and 1989 is probably due to weather patterns favorable for this species. The recently dead crowns of perennial grasses found in 1989 apparently reflect the 50% below average precipitation received in July, August and Sep- tember of 1988. It is well recognized that lagomorph populations ex- hibit large annual variation and densities from 0.25/ha (Steinberger and Whitford 1983) to 2.33/ha (Norris 1950) have been reported in the Jornada Basin. Specific vegeta- tion responses may be confounded by the inherent varia- tion in rabbit densities and foraging pressures. Neither seeding nor furrowing treatments had sub- stantive longterm vegetative impacts. These results were not surprising. Reseeding treatments in this environment are typically unsuccessful due to insufficient or ineffec- tual moisture for either seed germination or seedling survival. Furrowing treatments do not persist due to the susceptibility of bajada slopes to surface erosion during high-intensity rainstorms. Perennial grasses showed only limited increases in basal cover for thirty years following removal of above- ground shrub biomass. The shrub clearing treatment would not directly redistribute nutrients from their con- centration beneath shrub canopies. Beck and Tober (1985) also found that removal of shrubs did not always result in an increase of herbaceous species. The lagomorph treatment, however, demonstrated definite impacts on plant community structure and com- position. It is recognized that lagomorphs, like the rodent guilds studied by Brown and Heske (1990), can have profound impacts on desert shrub habitats and on ecosystem processes, e.g., litter inputs (Steinberger and Whitford 1983). Jackrabbits utilize creosotebush twigs with high mois- ture content during winter and early spring (Steinberger and Whitford 1983). If this occurred on the plots the level of use did not create a significant difference between lagomorph excluded and unexcluded treatments. The differences between mesquite and tarbush canopy cover on the lagomorph treatments may reflect a true jackrab- bit influence. Mesquite is an important part of jackrabbit diets (up to 30%) in the Jornada Basin, particularly in fall and winter (Dabo et al. 1982; Fatehi 1986). In a tarbush vegetation type, tarbush constituted up to 14% of jack- rabbit diets (Wansi 1989). While browsing of canopy components may account for the difference between treatments, it is also likely that consumption of seedlings played an important role. The greater canopy cover of mariola on the lagomorph excluded treatment in 1989 indicates that this species is heavily browsed by lago- morphs. In Arizona, Chew and Chew (1970) found that jackrabbits and wood rats (Neotoma spp.) pruned from 56 to 65% of the volume of mariola plants but consumed only about half of the material. Our study indicates that jackrabbits can affect canopy cover of mariola. However, at a site in southwestern New Mexico mariola had 1.5- to 2.6-fold more individuals on plots open to rabbits than on plots where rabbits had been excluded for 22 years (Beck and Tober 1985). The 30-fold greater basal area of spike dropseed on the lagomorphs excluded than on the unexcluded treat- ments indicates a real treatment response. Dropseeds are preferred forages (up to 40% of diets) for jackrabbits (Dabo et al. 1982). The large treatment difference shows that spike dropseed is susceptible to grazing pressure. Fluffgrass, which was more abundant on the lagomorph unexcluded treatment, may be occupying niches which would otherwise be occuppied by spike dropseed. Fluff- grass is a component of jackrabbit diets (Fatehi 1986; Wansi 1989), but is probably not a preferred item in this particular species mix. The many dead plants found in 1989 indicate that this short-lived species is controlled more by water availability than by grazing pressure. Neither black grama or bush muhly showed a response to the lagomorph treatments. Bush muhly was recorded as an item of jackrabbit diets in several studies in the Jornada Basin (Fatehi 1986, Wansi 1989; Schneberger 1990) but did not exceed 6% composition, indicating a low preference by jackrabbits. However, black grama is preferred by jackrabbits and contributes up to 54% of diets in summer months (Fatehi 1986). The lack of an exclusion response by black grama at the study site may result from reproductive strategy that is almost entirely vegetative in this weather regime (Nelson 1934). Shrubs, including creosotebush, characteristically produce secondary terpene metabolites as an anti-herbiv- ory strategy in carbon-rich, nutrient-poor desert environ- ments (Meyer and Karasov 1991). Herbivore uses of non-chemically defended plants are proportionately high. Though the ratio of shrub canopy cover to grass basal cover was similar (4:1) between excluded and unex- cluded treatments, there was an approximately 40% in- crease in both shrub canopy and grass basal cover with lagomorph exclusion. Exclusion of a principle herbivore from this system not only minimized differential defolia- tion between herbaceous species and the dominant shrub species, but probably also lessened the competitive ad- vantages of species with chemical-based herbivore de- fenses. It is well-understood that excessive herbivory can be a transitional force in this environment. However,</page><page sequence="8">217 grazing by even native herbivores within shrub-domi- nated states may be a mechanism of self-augmentation. Conclusions With the great concern over the impacts of livestock grazing upon native vegetation, the impact of small na- tive herbivores is often overlooked. Our study shows: 1) Preferential grazing by lagomorphs can influence the species composition of shrub, suffrutescent and perennial grass cover, and 2) Creosotebush dominated communites are resistant to substantial vegetative change by seeding, disturbance of the soil surface, or periodic removal of above-ground shrub biomass. These results were cumula- tive over time and persisted through the wet and dry weather cycles typical of arid ecosystems. There is still much to be learned about the influence of small native herbivores; however, it is apparent that they can and do play an important role in shaping the composition of desert plant communities. Inputs which fail to directly affect redistribution of limited nutrients should not be expected to disrupt self-augmentation of shrub-domi- nated states.
