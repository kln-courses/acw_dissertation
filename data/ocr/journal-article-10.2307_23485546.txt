Kahanov (Hebrew section: pp. 13-16) From 1990-1995 underwater salvage surveys were conducted in and around 'Akko Harbor (map ref. 1568/2584) prior to development. The surveys, on behalf of the Antiquities Authority Marine Archaeology Branch, were directed by E. Galili, J. Sharvit and U. Dahari, with the assistance of M. Aviam, E. Stern, G. Amit of the Institute for the Study of Oceans and Lakes (sonar mapping), A. Engart, A. Almaro, D. Moskovitz and A. Greenberg (divers), Y. Zomar, T. Shabi and A. Mokiri (inspection), G. Newlander (registration), S. Ben-Yehuda (drafting), C. Amit (studio photography), N. Ze'evi and H. Tahan (drawing), I. Carmi and D. Segal (14C analysis) and N. Lipshitz (botany). The archaeological material was processed and studied by N. Bahat Zilberstein (Hellenistic-Byzantine pottery), G. Finkielsztejn (amphora stamps), E. J. Stern (Crusader pottery, R. Kool (numismatics), Y. Kahanov (wooden parts of ships), and B. Rosen (fishing gear and ammunition). The Marina (Fig. 14:1). In 1990, an underwater survey was performed in and around the harbor prior to the consrucion of a new section of the harbor and reclamation of parts of the sea. The survey area was bordered on the north and east by the shoreline, in the west by the western end of the fishermen's harbor and in the south, by 258ט latitude. A sub-bottom profiler was used in the survey and 27 targets were located, which divers probed using a water jet. A diving survey was also carried out and aerial photographs of the survey area were examined, resulting in the identification of several shipwrecks. The remains of eight sailing vessels (Fig. 14:2-9), partially covered with sand, were observed. Six of the vessels had large parts of wooden hulls preserved (Fig. 14:2-7), which were dated by '4C analysis to the 19th and 20th centuries CE. Bronze and brass nails with a square cross section, as well as brass sheets (thickness 0.7 mm) that were used to sheath the boats, were recovered from these six vessels. One of the eight vessels was located near the entrance to the harbor, at a depth of c. 4 m (Fig. 14:8). It included part of a wooden hull (c. 3 x 5 m) that consisted of planks and wooden framing timbers with hydraulic cement between them, serving as ballast. The wooden parts were dated by '4C analysis to the Middle Ages (1062-1250 CE; uncalibrated) and were probably part of a long wooden boat (length c. 25 m) that was demolished in the harbor. One of the vessels was detected near the beach, at a depth of 2.5 m (Fig. 14:9); it comprised several wooden parts of a boat dated by 14C analysis to the end of the 17th-beginning of the 18th century CE. Other sections of the same boat, possibly abandoned near the shore, were probably buried below the sand. South of the surveyed area, at a depth of c. 8 m, a a concentration of undressed schist stones (length 0.1-0.4 m; Fig. 14:1), covered over with sand (thickness c. 2 m), was found. These slabs may have ballasted a sailing vessel that was wrecked in this spot. A stone anchor with a single perforation (c. 50 kg; Fig. 14:12) was also detected. This anchor type was common in the Middle Bronze Age; it was used, however, in later periods as well and therefore, is difficult to date. Other finds included a stone cannonball (diam. 0.18 m), probably from the 17th century CE, fragments of pottery vessels, such as Mamluk-period glazed ware, a ceramic lantern, clay pipes from the Ottoman period, blue-decorated porcelain vessels from the Far East and animal bones, mainly cattle and camels. 12*</page><page sequence="2">During the survey, other remains were examined in the vicinity of the harbor, including the southern breakwater (Fig. 14:13), the'Island ofFlies'(Fig. 14:14), the eastern rampart (Fig. 14:15) and remains of two sailing vessels that had previously been excavated by the Society for Underwater Archaeological Research (Fig. 14:10) and the University of Flaifa (Fig. 14:11). One of these vessels (Fig. 14:11) carried a cargo of schist for ballast and was dated by 14C analysis to the beginning of the 20th century CE. In the wake of the survey's finds, it was decided that the development work could continue provided additional underwater probes and salvage excavations of sailing vessel remains and the harbor's installations be undertaken in the area slated for development. Furthermore, it was determined that future work, involving the cleaning, deepening or widening of the harbor would require underwater surveys and archaeological inspections. The Deepening of the Harbor (Fig. 14:11). Inspection of antiquities was undertaken in November 1992 and June 1993, while deepening the fishermen's harbor (the western basin) and its entrances. The deepening of the harbor was carried out by a crane with a grab located atop a barge. It was dredging mud and sand sediment that were transferred to another barge with an opening in its bottom, which transferred the material from the harbor out to sea. The surveyors examined and sorted out the scooped material and separated the ancient finds. Following the examination, the material was cast into the open sea, in areas marked by numbered buoys, which were initially checked for ancient finds. The meager Bronze Age finds included two stone anchors with a single perforation each and a loaf shaped, copper ingot. Only several fragments of pottery vessels from the Iron Age and Persian period were discovered. The few ancient remains prior to the 3rd century BCE, as well as the complete absence of imported Attic ware, which was predominant in the coastal region, indicate that no intensive maritime activity was carried out in the harbor's western basin prior to the Hellenistic period. A fundamental change in the maritime activity of the harbor's western basin occurred during the Hellenistic period. The finds from this period include numerous pottery vessels, among them amphorae and vessels for daily use, as well as metal objects. These finds attest to extensive commercial relations with the Mediterranean countries and the wide-scale import of food products from the Aegean area. Presumably, the southern breakwater (Fig. 14:13) was constructed at that time, as evidenced by the large and diverse finds from the period and the sediments in the harbor, which indicate the favorable anchorage conditions. The finds from the Roman period were numerous, including jars, everyday pottery vessels, and bowls that consisted of Western Terra Sigilatta (WTS) ware, which is rarely found in land sites. The WTS assemblage contains, among others, a flat bowl with an incised decoration on the base, depicting a boat tied to a tree by its bow (a practice known as Mediterranean anchorage; Fig. 15) and a deep bowl, incised with four iron anchors (Fig. 16). Metal vessels of the period were also present. Remains of a wooden hull (Fig. 14:16) were discovered in the northern part of the harbor, at a depth of 3.5 m; it has framing timbers sheathing, various wooden parts and bronze nails with a square cross section and a flat head. Laboratory examinations revealed that the framing timbers were made of European pine and were dated, by 14C analysis, to 144-213 CE (calibrated). The thick planks were also made of European pine and dated to 147-250 CE (calibrated). The results of the '4C analysis, the usage of mortise and tenon joints. The wooden parts and the shape of the nails indicate that the boat dates to the Roman period (2nd-3rd centuries CE). Judging by the length of the wooden pieces preserved from the boat it seems that the boat was a medium-sized vessel, wrecked in the western basin of the ancient harbor. The ceramic finds indicate a significant increase in commercial relations with the Mediterranean countries, as well as the presence of a well-to-do society that resided here. It seems that most of the maritime activity in this period was concentrated in the harbor's western basin, which provided shelter to medium-sized boats with a draft of 2.5-3.0 m. Finds from the Byzantine period were retrieved mainly from the entrance to the western basin. These included a few wooden sections, bronze nails and several coins, probably belonging to a wooden craft that sank in the entrance to the western basin. Large numbers of different-type jars were recovered close to the remains of the wreck and may originally have been part of its cargo. Several broken iron anchors (Fig. 17) were also found in the western basin. The broken anchors and the sparse finds in the western basin point 13*</page><page sequence="3">to unfavorable anchorage conditions that appear to have existed in this period. In absence of proper maintenance, the southern breakwater was probably destroyed and could no longer protect the vessels, which were compelled to drop anchor when taking shelter in the western basin. No finds from the Early Islamic period were detected within the western basin limits. The historian Muqaddasi described the construction of a harbor in 'Akko by Tbn Tülün; this harbor was probably established in the eastern basin, which was not inspected at during the current project. The chain that closed the opening to the harbor and which Muqaddasi described, apparently extended from the 'Island of Flies' (Fig. 14:14) to the eastern end of the southern breakwater (Fig. 14:13). Owing to its great length, the chain was most likely, partially submerged. Apparently, the eastern rampart (Fig. 14:15), whose remains are currently underwater, was built as a barrier on the east against enemy ships and as an approach road to the 'Island of Flies', rather than as a breakwater, which had previously been suggested by scholars. The waves reaching the harbor from the east did not endanger vessels anchored there because the bay's eastern shore was close to the harbor and sheltered it. Finds from the Crusader period were mainly uncovered close to the entrance of the western basin, beyond the limits of the Hellenistic and Roman-period harbor that yielded only several pottery fragments. The finds included pottery vessels from Cyprus, Syria, the Anatolian coast, the Aegean Sea and Italy. The western basin seems to have been blocked with sand during the Crusader period, due to neglect and absence of proper maintenance. Most of the maritime activity was conducted in the eastern basin, where the finds from this period, similar to those from the Early Islamic period, are likely to exist below the sand. Many finds from the Mamluk and Ottoman periods were located at the entrance to the western basin and to its east. In these periods, large vessels with deep drafts had apparently anchored outside the western basin and their merchandise was transported by boats. The ceramic finds indicate relations with countries in the northeastern Mediterranean Sea, such as Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. According to historical sources, the Muslims intentionally destroyed the harbor after the Crusader period, fearing the Christian return. In the 15th century CE, abandoned buildings in the city were used to store cotton; it seems that the destroyed harbor was adapted for handling this commodity. A wooden pier (Fig. 14:17), dated by 14C analysis to 1425-1461 CE (calibrated), was detected near the harbor's entrance. The pier included rectangular timber pillars that were driven into the bottom of the sea and rose to a height of c. 0.5 m above the seabed. The numismatic finds consist of 23 gold coins and 16 bronze coins. Twenty-one gold coins were identified as florins, struck in Florence, Italy, from the second half of the 13th century. Another gold coin was identified as a nomisma histamenon of the Byzantine emperor Constantine VIII (976-1025 CE). One more gold coin was identified as a dinar of the Muwahhidi ruler, 'Abd el-Mu'amin ibn 'All el-KUml (1130-1163 CE), minted in Bijaya, in eastern Algeria. The bronze coins have a time span from the Roman until the Umayyad period. The earliest bronze coin is dated to the reign of Nero (54-68 CE; struck in Antioch). Three of the coins date to the reigns of the emperors Caracal la (198-217 CE), Alexander Severus (222-235 CE) and Phillip I (244-249 CE), all minted in 'Akko. The latest bronze coins date to the time of the Umayyad dynasty, following the reform of' Abdel-Malik (697-750 CE). In 1994, the locations where the material removed from the harbor had previously been dumped were re examined. More coins were revealed, including nine gold florins that belonged to the florin assemblage from the survey, a gold solidus from the reign of the Byzantine emperor Constans II (641-646 CE) and two bronze coins from the Byzantine and Umayyad periods. The glass finds included lumps of raw green glass and numerous fragments of glass vessels, such as jugs, bottles, goblets and lamp bases from the Roman, Byzantine and Early Islamic periods. The metal objects comprised two anthropomorphic items, balance scales, bronze buckles and hookahs, and a bell. The fishing equipment consisted of items, such as bronze fishhooks, lead and stone weights for fishing nets and stone rings (diam. 0.25 m, weight 4-5 kg), used to dislodge fishhooks snagged between the rocks. Iron artillery shells and lead rifle bullets were found, as were wooden objects, including several pulley blocks of different diameters, used originally to rig the boats that were wrecked in the harbor. The copious finds recovered in the survey show that the harbor was first built during the Hellenistic period (3rd century BCE) in the area of the western basin and reached its peak in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. 14*</page><page sequence="4">In the Byzantine period, the anchorage conditions worsened and the southern breakwater was probably destroyed. At the end of the Umayyad period and in the Abbasid period (end of 7th-end of 9th centuries CE), the harbor was enlarged eastward and the eastern rampart was constructed (Fig. 14:15), connecting the 'Island of Flies' (Fig. 14:14) with the bay's northern shore. The finds from these periods are scanty, possibly because no part of the eastern basin was excavated. The southern breakwater is depicted in charts from 1686 as a line of low shoals, demarcating a closed basin. Yet, illustrations and maps of later periods show relatively high buildings on the middle of the southern breakwater and at its eastern end. Apparently, at the end of the 17th century or beginning of the 18th century CE, large buildings were constructed on the southern breakwater that do not appear on maps and charts from the beginning of the 20th century, probably because they were not preserved. The 'Pisan Anchorage' (Fig. 14:111). In 1993, an underwater survey had taken place west of the harbor, in an area referred to as the 'Pisan Anchorage', to examine the possibility of constructing a pedestrian bridge that would connect the western city wall with the harbor area. The remains of the southern breakwater (Fig. 14:13), which lie west of the modern breakwater, and the remains of buildings from the Crusader period were examined. Several granite column drums (diam. 0.4-0.6 m) were uncovered and in the western part of the survey area, close to the city wall, a complete granite column (diam. 0.8 m, length 3 m) was found. These columns evidently belonged to a consignment of construction items brought to ' Akko from Caesarea in the 18th century CE by Pasha Ahmad el-Jazzar, for the purpose of building and renovating the city wall and the breakwater. The columns, originally of the Roman period, were probably incorporated in the fortifications, in secondary use, and collapsed into the sea when the city walls were destroyed, as happened in Ashqelon and Caesarea. Another cargo of granite and marble columns had previously been discovered northwest of 'Akko, at a depth of 15 m, within the framework of a previous statewide underwater survey (ESI 5:109-110). The eastern part of the survey area yielded concentrations of masonry blocks and fieldstones that were part of collapsed buildings, dating to several periods. Several iron artillery shells (diam. 15-17 cm) were also scattered on the seabed, attesting to the battles that raged there in the 18th and 19th centuries CE and are documented in historical sources. In the northwestern part of the survey area, below the patio of the 'Pisan Harbor Restaurant', the foundations of a building from the Crusader period were discovered; the restaurant's patio is built upon the vaults of the building. Due to the undermining of the restaurant's foundation by the sea waves, the building was fdled with concrete before it could be photographed and properly documented. The survey finds raised the possibility that construction of the pedestrian bridge would damage antiquities and the landscape in the area of the ancient breakwater; consequently, the project was not approved. Judging by the ancient finds and the physical characteristics of the region (rocky and shallow seabed), it is unlikely that the area called the 'Pisan harbor' could have served as an anchorage for sea vessels. However, it could have been a landing point for small boats, unloading passaengers and cargoes from larger veseesls that anchored off shore of the 'Pisan' quarter. The Southern Breakwater (Fig. 14:1 V). During September-December 1995, an underwater survey was undertaken along the planned extension of the southern, modern breakwater. The survey area (70 x 250 m) extended in a south-southeastern direction from the southeastern end of the southern breakwater. Divers methodically scanned the bottom of the sea, aided by a meter-marked steel cable, and probes were carried out in the seabed, using a water jet. The seabed consisted of loose kurkar, kurkar pebbles and carbonaceous sand (thickness 1-4 m). Several worn, non-diagnostic potsherds and two iron artillery shells were recovered. Remains of the ancient breakwater were discerned below the stones of the modern breakwater in the northeastern corner of the survey area. Conservation work will be carried out in this section of the breakwater, including the removal of several rocks from the modern breakwater, which will expose the ancient breakwater's remains.
