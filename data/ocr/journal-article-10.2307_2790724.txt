Dr. Leakey is well known for the illuminating discoveries which he has made in recent years regarding prehistoric man in Africa. In this book he has correlated the results of his own researches with the available data bearing on the evolution of Man in other parts of the world, and he has succeeded in producing a most valuable outline of human prehistory. This outline is ' popular ' in the sense that it presents in a brief and remarkably lucid manner a statement of the problems and the present position of the science of pal~oanthro- pology, and at the same time it is an erudite work which contains many refreshingly original ideas and interpre- tations which challenge the serious attention of the professional anthropologist. Pal~oanthropology is a subject which demands the ce-operation of a number of experts--the geologist, pal~ontologist, anatomist, typo- legist, etc. The reviewer can claim a special knowledge of only one of the sciences which are thus involved, and is therefore not in a position to offer a critical survey of the whole of Dr. Leakey's thesis. Dr. Leakey has had extensive practical experience in the manufacture and interpretation of stone implements. Indeed, in his skill in the use of these tools, he must equal the original, pal~olithic craftsmen, for he records that with a single Aurignacian backed-blade he was able to skin and cut up a Thompson's gazelle in less than twenty minutes. He devotes several chapters to pal~olithic cultures, and shows that the subdivision of these cultures is probably much more complicated than is generally realized. "During the Upper Pleistocene," he says, "the various "species of Stone Age man were sub-dividing into "innumerable races and tribes, each of which often "made its stone tools by such distinctive methods, or "of such distinct types, that we have to give them new "labels to distinguish them." Apart from the question whether differences of technique necessarily imply racial differences, there is little doubt that Dr. Leakey has made out a strong case for his classification of pal~olithic cultures, and he is to be congratulated not only-on the lucidity of his treatment of this intricate subject, but also on the way in which he has attempted the very difficult task of correlating the cultures of different parts of the world with the geological phases of the Pleistocene period. A considerable part of Dr. Leakey's book is devoted to an account of the various physical types of pal~olithic man. By reference to certain features of the skull, i.e., the conformation of the supra-orbital ridges and the tympanic plate, the presence or absence of a ' canine ' fossa, the disposition of the alveolar processes of the [ 110 ]</page><page sequence="2">July, 1935.] M AN [Nos. 119-122 mandible, and the development of a chin eminence, he sharply divides the main human stem into two groups, Paleoanthropoidea-which includes the Neanderthal types, Pithecanthropus, and Sinanthropus, and the Neoan- thropoidea-whichincludesHomo and Eoanthropus. More- over, he represents these two groups as having diverged so far back as the Miocene period. Most anatomists will consider that this view is rather extreme. In the earlier representatives of the Neanderthal type, e.g., the Ehringsdorf fossil discovered in 1925, the distinctive 'neanderthaloid' features were evidently much less pronounced than in later forms, and approximated more closely to Homo sapiens. This suggests that the Nean- derthal type may have arisen in Pleistocene times as a secondary regression from a type more akin physically to modern man. Again, the remarkable anatomical features of the jaw and teeth of Eoanthropus seem to outweigh very considerably the evidence of the calvarium in assessing the relation of this form to Homo sapiens. The characters which Dr. Leakey has selected for his classifi- cation of palaeolithic man are probably too few to allow of certain conclusions, and it may be questioned whether they are all entirely satisfactory criteria from the taxonomic point of view. Thus the 'canine' fossa as described and figured in this book lacks a clear definition, and we may note incidentally that it evidently does not correspond to the canine fossa of human anatomists. Nevertheless, Dr. Leakey's conclusions are of the greatest interest and demand a close consideration. His re- searches have produced strong evidence that modern types of Man were in existence in Africa in the early part of the Lower Pleistocene, that is to say, at an earlier date than would have been conjectured by most anthro- pologists. This discovery has rather abruptly upset the current conceptions regarding the evolution of Homo sapiens, and it will doubtless take some time for anthro- pologists to adjust their own ideas of human phylo- genesis in order to take these new facts into account. Dr. Leakey's Homo Kanamens8s is so closely similar to Homo sapiens (judging by rather fragmentary remains) that it may well be doubted whether it deserves a separate specific name, and yet these remains are derived from very early Pleistocene deposits. This implies that the genesis of modern types of Man is to be sought in Pliocene or even Miocene times. Certainly we must accept the probability that-the human stem had already segregated from the common anthropomorph stock (which also gave rise to the modern anthropoid apes) in Miocene times, for we have the striking evidence of a fossil chimpanzee found in Miocene deposits of East Africa and recently described by Dr. Hopwood. This fossil is so similar to the modern chimpanzee that some authorities doubt whether it can be distinguished generically. If, then, the modern anthropoid apes were almost fully differentiated in the Miocene, the evolution of the human stem must at least have progressed some considerable distance at that early time. In his foreword to Dr. Leakey's book, Sir Gowland Hopkins remarks that it " will appeal to a wide circle and will make clear to all its readers the increasing dignity of prehistory as a subject for study." We heartily endorse this opinion. Dr. Leakey has an unusually attractive style, and throughout his book he shows an intimate knowledge of all the branches of pal,oanthropology combined with the ability to sift evi- dence with skill and judgment.
