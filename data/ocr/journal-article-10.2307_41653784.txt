While expressing agreement with this view I draw on Sigmund Freud's discussion of the death instinct in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (Freud 1920/1959) to suggest that the later stages of the aging process may involve an increase in detours and backward movements. Suggesting that these detours and backward steps are potentially beneficial, I conclude that Freud provides guidelines for how we may view and evaluate the losses and gains that Pruyser identifies as characteristic of the later stages of the aging process. Keywords Aging • Paul W. Pruyser • Iconic illusion • Life span models • Losses • Gains • Forward movement • Karl Menninger • Vital balance • Sigmund Freud • Death instinct • Detours • Backward steps Introduction In this article, I will be focusing on Paul W. Pruyser's article titled "Aging: Downward, Upward, or Forward?" (Pruyser 1975), in which he argues that the aging process should be viewed as a forward movement. His article titled "Creativity in Aging Persons" (Pruyser 1987b) was published posthumously in the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic in September 1987, five months after his death. This article draws on the argument developed in the earlier article but adds several new insights in its support. In my view, Pruyser makes a persuasive case in "Aging: Downward, Upward, or Forward?" for perceiving the aging process as a forward movement, especially when this D.

In support of this proposal I will draw on Freud's dual instinct theory as presented in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (Freud 1920/1959). Pruyser's Professional Life Before I discuss Pruyser's articles on aging, a few words about his professional life may be useful, especially for readers who are unfamiliar with him and his work. My source for this brief summary of his professional life is Jon G. Allen's biographical sketch in a special issue of the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic (Allen 1987, pp. 416-418) in tribute to Paul W. Pruyser, an issue that included several personal testimonies (including Karl and Roy Menninger), the "Creativity in Aging Persons" article by Pruyser, an article on religious challenges of aging by Raymond Studzinski (1987), an article by Karl Menninger on hope (Menninger 1987), Pruyser's previously published article titled "Maintaining Hope in Adversity" (Pruyser 1986/1 987c), and a bibliography of his published writings. Allen was the associate editor of the bulletin. Pruyser had been its editor up to the time of his death. Born on May 29, 1916, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Paul W. Pruyser did graduate work in psychology at the University of Amsterdam, and immigrated to the United States in 1948, completing his doctoral work in clinical psychology at Boston University in 1953. He worked at the National Veterans Epilepsy Center, interned at Boston State Hospital, and taught at Boston University. From 1954 to 1956 he spent two years as a senior psychologist at Topeka State Hospital and then joined the staff at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas. At the Menninger Foundation, he served as director of the Department of Education from 1962 to 1971, assuming responsibility for all the professional training programs, which included a thriving Clinical Pastoral Education program under the direction of Thomas W. Klink, the hospital's head chaplain. In 1972 Pruyser was appointed Henry March Pfeiffer Professor of Research and Education in Psychiatry at the Menninger Foundation. He retired from his full-time position in 1985, but continued as director of the interdisciplinary studies program, as a faculty member of the school of psychiatry and mental health services, as a clinical consultant, and as editor of the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic. He was editor of the Bulletin from 1978 until the time of his death on April 9, 1987. Although he had struggled with cancer for several years, the immediate cause of death was a sudden heart attack. He was a member and elder of the First Pres- byterian Church of Topeka. In addition to numerous articles and book chapters, he wrote five books, including A Dynamic Psychology of Religion (1968), Between Belief and Unbelief (1974a), The Min- ister as Diagnostician (1976c), The Psychological Examination (1979), and The Play of the Imagination: Toward a Psychoanalysis of Culture (1983). He edited two others: Diagnosis and the Difference It Makes (1976a) and Changing Views of the Human Condition (Pruyser 1987a), which were published posthumously.1 In addition to his articles in Pastoral 1 Another posthumous article "Where Do We Go from Here? Scenarios for the Psychology of Religion" (Pruyser 1987c) was published in the June 1987 issue of The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. I was editor of the journal at the time.

(Pruyser 1975) was published in Pastoral Psychology when he was 59 years old. The fact that his book Between Belief and Unbelief (Pruyser 1974a) was published the previous year and The Minister as Diagnostician (Pruyser 1976c) was published the following year indicates that this was a very productive period in his life.3 This was also the year that he delivered his presidential address to the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion on "Lessons from Art Theory for the Footnote 1 continued previous articles in the journal and also draws attention to the recent publication of "Maintaining Hope in Adversity" in the 1986 winter issue of Pastoral Psychology. It also notes that when he submitted the article the previous October, he wrote that he did not want any special consideration from me as editor, but he observed that, in light of his struggle with cancer, this might well be his "swan song" as far as his work in psychology of religion was concerned. I suggested that one can almost hear him asking this question of the universe - "where do we go from here?" - and then, having asked it, adding something like, "But don't tell me. I'll want to see and hear it for myself." I also indicated that the article challenges his colleagues to address two important questions: (1) Is there a developmental or dialectic dynamic in religion itself that moves from more or less anthropomorphic theistic imagery to impersonal or atheistic conceptions? and (2) Is religion, even among the educated and intellectually ambitious, a favorite and socially sanctioned area of stagnation, fixation, or regression? I suggested that I could think of no better way to orient ourselves for such explorations than to read or re-read his A Dynamic Psychology of Religion (1968), Between Belief and Unbelief (1974a) and The Play of the Imagination (1983). 2 In Pastoral Care: A Thematic Approach (Capps 2003) I suggested that his own case of Lambert (Pruyser 1976), a college student who sought help from a local pastor in the wake of the breakup of a romantic relationship, indicates that such a diagnosis may focus on the major theological theme (in this case prov- idence), a minor theme that interacts with the major theme (in this case repentance ), and a theme that is conspicuous by its absence (in this case, communion ). 3 We may wonder why he wrote about aging at such a productive period in his life. He had recently written a memorial tribute to Herman Gijbert can der Waals, M. D. (Pruyser 1974b), a Dutch psychoanalyst who had fled the Netherlands when Hitler invaded it, who had served as the Hospital director at Menninger and had also been a prominent figure in the Topeka Institute for Psychoanalysis; and 3 years earlier he had written a memorial tribute to Thomas W. Klink, who had served for many years as chaplain and director of the Pastoral Care and Counseling Department at Menninger (Pruyser 1971). He had also written an article on science and values that focused on his own "odyssey" (Pruyser 1973). This combination of memorial tributes to long-term colleagues and professional life review (however abbreviated) may have contributed to his interest in the aging process. Another factor may have been the long-term effects of what Lawrence J. Friedman in his historical study of the Menninger Foundation (Friedman 1990) calls "the palace revolt" - the ouster of Karl Menninger in 1965 as President of the Foundation. Although Pruyser was personally loyal to Menninger (he once told me that Karl Menninger was "like a father to me") he participated in the ouster, believing that it was in the best interests of the hospital. Friedman notes that his "closest colleagues acknowledged that Pruyser had taken an emotional beating" and that he "aged precipitously" (p. 324). He also indicates that Pruyser "was removed as Education Department director in 1971" (p. 324) but does not indicate the reasons. Perhaps he was personally motivated to discover the gains amid the losses that accompany aging. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="4">482 J Relig Health (2012) 51:479-497 Psychology of Religion" (Pruyser 1976b).4 A major emphasis of his presidential address - the importance of the imagination - plays a significant role in his article on aging. The abstract summarizes the article on aging as follows: Life views are dominated by an iconic illusion that forces the span of life into a low- high-low sequence of stages. Aging is seen as a loss, decline, a downhill course. But while there are losses in aging, there are also gains, and empirical observations show that many persons enjoy getting older. From a psychodynamic viewpoint the losses in aging, though painful, are made bearable by considerable gains that afford new pleasures. Aging's gains and losses are described, leading to the conclusion that the life course is neither upward nor downward, but a forward movement full of new discoveries, (p. 102) He begins the article itself with the observation that although "it is true that views on aging vary by culture and change with the times, nearly all Western views of aging are similar in one respect," namely, "the overruling conviction that life has a peak, some- where, with an upward and a downward slope on either side" (p. 102). He cites the first four lines from William Shakespeare's sonnet (Shakespeare 1952, p. 1595) as a poetical expression of this conviction: When forty winters shall besiege thy brow And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, The youth's proud livery, so gazed on now, Will be a tatter' d weed, of small worth held.5 4 In this address, he suggested that "certain concepts in the theory of art might be applicable to the psychology of religion, particularly when one realizes that in ontogenesis the individual tends to be introduced at once to art and religion" (Pruyser 1976, p. 1). He began by describing the reciprocal rein- forcement between art and religion in childhood and subsequent cultural experience, then went on to explore how the art-theoretical constructions of craft, imagination, and illusion contribute to our understanding of religion. He developed the theme of illusion in The Play of the Imagination (Pruyser 1983), introducing the distinction between "illusion" and "illusionistic," and making a case for illusionistic ways of thinking and imagining. Following his lead, I made a similar proposal for the relevance of art theory for pastoral theology in "The Lessons of Art Theory for Pastoral Theology" (Capps 1999; see also Capps 2010). 5 Like most sonnets, this one does not simply continue in the same vein for another ten lines, but instead begins at line nine (the traditional turning shift) to suggest that the loss of one's physical beauty is compensated for if one has been the parent of a "fair child." Here are lines five through fourteen: Then being asked where all thy beauty lies, Where all the treasure of thy lusty days. To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise. How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use If thou couldst answer, "This fair child of mine Shall sum my count and make my old excuse," Proving his beauty by succession thine! This were to be new-made when thou art old, And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold. This shift in perspective does not directly challenge Pruyser's view that the poem reflects the "overruling conviction" that life has a peak and that those beyond a certain age (here 40 years old) are on a downward slope. At the same time, its mention of a compensating factor supports his view (yet to be presented) that old age is not only one of loss but also of newly experienced gains. Springer</page><page sequence="5">J Relig Health (2012) 5 1 M9-A91 483 He adds: "It does not matter greatly whether the peak is at thirty, forty, or fifty years" as these differences "may depend on the average expectable life span, the composition of the population pyramid, the epidemiology of illness, the economic system, and the education and welfare policies of a society" (p. 102). What does matter is that the "visual imagi- nation sees a peak, flanked by valleys, one rising, one declining, in an aesthetically sat- isfying symmetry" (p. 102). Thus: "Life views are shaped by a regnant Gestalt of low- high-low proportions, an iconic illusion that pre-sorts all perceptions of the life cycle into a triphasic sequence" (pp. 102-103). Pruyser points out that there are an infinite number of representations of this "iconic illusion," and that each one of them reinforces the basic idea so strongly that we take the illusion for reality "until a rare or unexpected occasion elicits some puzzlement" (p. 103). These representations include "the symmetrical model of the peak flanked by two valleys"; the curve model used in empirical research "with its impressive middle section, tapered off evenly on either side"; its literary form as expressed "in the 'ages of man' of which Shakespeare's sonnet is only one example"; the linear model which "presents the image of the arc of life describing a curve through space again in a rise-peak-fall sequence"; the existential version as "a stretch of contingency, arched in the middle, suspended between the perplexing 'thrownness' of birth and the appalling 'pushed-outness' of death"; the journeyer's model which "shows a crawling babe rising to become a walking, erect adult who in turn becomes a shuffling, cane-supported oldster"; the activity model which "puts work in the middle, preceded by play, and followed by retirement, which may be just another word for play"; and the economic model which "centers on the productive years, preceded by a vague stretch of consumerism that contains, happily, a teen-age market [and] followed by the rentier's golden years that erode capital and produce no goods, but, happily, even so provide a market for nursing homes and retirement village builders" (p. 103). As Pruyser calls this an "iconic illusion," it is not surprising that we would also find it in the arts , where, he notes, it "is reinforced by the triptychs öf church altars with their major center panels and minor side wings; by the Laocoön group with its dominant, vigorous, high-rising center figure, and by the cascading structure of great churches and palaces whose major cupolas and spires are centered to draw one's gaze to a rise, peak, and fall pattern" (p. 103). Perhaps its homeliest form is "the Victorian fireplace mantel arrangement whose centerpiece, the clock, is flanked by two ornamental vases that are kept completely dysfunctional" (p. 103). He concludes: "So much in the world proclaims a tripartite or triphasic pattern with a dominant center that we come to think of this pattern as a cosmic, ordained reality, and as a leitmotiv of life," and given its ubiquity, "This powerful iconic illusion thwarts us from seeing, or making, alternative patterns" (p. 103). On the other hand, there have been different visions of aging, such as the fact that "the Greeks prized youth and old age but seemed to find little to admire about the middle years," and in some societies, especially those that have established patterns of ancestor worship, "the aged have such venerable status and benefits that aging is a positive goal of life and a desirable process" (p. 104). At the other extreme, there are societies in which "older people have not only been deni- grated, as they are by and large today, but were even sent into the wilderness to die" (p. 104). These various models indicate "that culture is a powerful determinant of attitudes toward aging and, hence, of feelings about selfhood at any age of life" (p. 104). In fact, "The impact of cultural factors on aging is so strong that it is foolish to belittle them as less real than the biology of aging" (p. 104). Also, although in principle cultural factors are â Springer</page><page sequence="6">484 J Relig Health (20 1 2) 5 1 :479-497 more changeable than biological factors, cultural change does not come easily, so if we want our conceptions about aging to change - no simple task - we need, in his judgment, to supplement "scientific data-gathering" with "existential inquiries and consciousness- raising, with keen alertness to the ideological consequences that follow from the dominant iconic illusion of aging" (p. 104). Unfortunately, It is very difficult to find even provisional agreement on what aging is. If aging is growing , in what sense does growing continue, stop, or change with the years? If aging is coming of age , time markers are introduced that set off one period of life from another for reasons of privilege and duty. If aging is maturing , the noun "maturity" introduces normative ideas about the course of the process denoted by the verb, elaborated by notions of "ripe," "over-ripe," and "rot" borrowed from horticulture, or by gastronomic notions of aging used in wine and cheese making. If aging is getting on in years , we may think of judgment beginning to prevail over action, maybe of mellowing, perhaps of fatigue setting in; psychiatrists have reason to think of vulnerability and depression.... And if aging is taken as the process meant to eventuate in being aged , it is largely seen as a foreboding of failing powers and eventual death, (pp. 104-105) With these variations in outlook and meaning "the so-called facts of aging have a rather dubious status" for many of these "facts" are functions of particular viewpoints, disci- plines, social observations, personal observations, etc., and the few facts that we have are "so minute and piecemeal that their import is unclear, since there is no way of assigning specific weight to them" (p. 105). He notes, for example, that autopsies have shown gross erosion of an entire brain hemisphere in older persons who nonetheless experienced exemplary physical and mental preservation until their last days. How, he asks, can we weigh this fact against, for example, the slowing of reaction times in reflexes over time? In light of these difficulties of fact-finding and knowing what to make of the few facts we do have, it would be easy to become nihilistic about the very idea that we can gain some understanding of the aging process. However, in Pruyser's view, such nihilism is unwarranted for we do know a few things about the aging process. One is that there is no escape from what St. Augustine identifies as the three presents - a present of things past, of things present, and things future - and that they "gradually assume different ratios in each person's life" (p. 105). Moreover, "this is an entirely endogenous process, so basic that it serves as an ordering principle for the smaller facts and more ad hoc observations one can make about aging" (p. 105).6 Nor can one overlook the fact that there is a "waning of physical vigor and alacrity of mind as the years roll by" and that death "lurks around the corner and can be held at bay for only so long" (p. 105). He suggests that "the vital balance quivers between the two forces of life and death, always precariously, and death has the edge in the long run by the sheer weight of its inertia" (p. 105). On the other hand, one's "increasing awareness of this eventual inertia" and of "the feelings it engenders are everyone's lot in life and may be the primary definition of aging each person will arrive at for himself' (pp. 105-106). If so, it is noteworthy in Pruyser's view that this "vital balance" is experienced by the individual person as "an ongoing process of losses and gains, mourning and rejoicing" (p. 107). The problem is that we "know quite a bit about the losses, and very little about the gains, because aging has so often been described, under the aegis of our iconic illusion, as a 6 The dictionary (Agnes 2001) defines endogenous as "developing from within; originating internally" (p. 470). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="7">J Relig Health (20 1 2) 5 1 :479-497 485 stepwise approach to decrepitude" (p. 107). To address this imbalance, he discusses, in the remaining pages of the article, both the losses and the gains that accompany the aging process. Losses in the Aging Process Although the losses that accompany the aging process have been discussed far more than the gains, Pruyser cautions that we should not for this reason "deny or play down these losses, for coping with them is one of the taxing and energy-consuming features of aging, which itself may accelerate the aging process and set up spiral effects" (p. 107). In a way, "aging is being put to a test of endurance: failure in coping with any specific loss undermines the aptness of one's response to the next loss, while success in coping with one loss may give one the vigor to face the next with bravery and skill" (p. 107). In his discussion of the losses, he focuses on those that especially involve "personal setbacks" (p. 107). The first such "personal setback" is the loss of personal dignity . He points out: The aged are subject to many indignities that are experienced as a frontal attack on their self-concept, their feeling of self- worth, and the maintenance mechanisms of self-regard. Whether these assaults on dignity are purely societal, or whether they are enhanced or perpetuated by the victims themselves through attitudes of self-fulfilling prophecy, makes little difference to the actuality of the experience, which is felt as a narcissistic blow. (p. 108) He notes that these blows may "fall harder" today, and be felt by more people than in former ages "due to the great increase in average life span expectancy from hygienic and nutritional improvements, medical 'miracles,' disaster control, and greater ease in living" (p. 108). An irony of the increase in average life span expectancy is that if "the average expectancy is low fewer people are exposed to the indignities of old age" (p. 108). The second personal setback is the loss of work. Pruyser suggests that this loss "runs a close second in importance to loss of dignity, and may be intimately linked with it" (p. 108). He points to a recent book by Terkel (1974) on the work of ordinary or low- income people which shows that "workers, by and large, tend to endow their jobs with a profound sense of vocation full of humanistic, religious, or ethical values that make them feel a significant part of a quasi-sacred scheme, even if they are by social standards no more than cogs in a machine" (p. 108). These attitudes toward work "seem to capture some meanings of the theological concept of vocation or calling, in which work (of any sort) makes one a participant in creation and providence, giving each person a definite place and a significant role in a cosmic plan" (p. 108). In this sense, loss of work is the loss of vocation, "depriving a person of the concrete experience of values and meaning" (p. 108).7 In addition to a sense of vocation, work provides a framework for reality testing and this, Pruyser notes, is "another factor of great importance to mental health" (p. 108): 7 The sense of vocation is one of the seven theological guidelines that Pruyser (1976) in Pruyser' s schema for pastoral diagnosis. So, too, is providence. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="8">486 J Relig Health (2012) 51:479-497 "Work brings a person into forced contact with the nature of things and materials, with the resistance of matter, with the contours and definitions of ideas, and the nature of cause and effect relations, with sensory qualities, mass and force" (p. 108). In turn, this contact "checks the unbridled fantasy, giving a counterweight to the wishes, longings, and impulses from the id, thereby providing a pivotal point for the ego's balancing tasks" (p. 108). In short, work "draws us out of ourselves into the world; it forces us to deal with the actual outlines of reality, shoulders us with obligations, and harnesses our energies" (p. 109), Given the importance of the sense of time to one's perception of the aging process in relation to oneself, work is also valuable because it "structures the flow of time for us into distinct periods for action and relaxation, work and play" (p. 109). It also structures space in terms of home and workplace and in terms of thought and conversation "by giving us opportunities to talk about our work while we are at home and to talk about home when we are at work" (p. 109). Thus, the loss of work "demolishes this outer structuring device and forces us to impose arrangements on time and space and social intercourse that have to be created de novo by what inner structuring resources we have" (p. 109). In short, "Having to give up working, one's reality contact may become tenuous, with an automatic takeover by fantasies that are prone to lead to regression" (p. 109). A third significant personal is the loss of independence. Pruyser observes: "This is a subtle thing because dependency and independence are relati vistic notions; nevertheless, they are a powerful factor in life that comes to act as a value orientation because devel- opment demands that we move in one direction from an original state of great dependency to one of independence in adulthood" (p. 109). He adds: "This progression and its intensity are prescriptive; in our culture we are exhorted to be maximally independent" (p. 109). In fact, the very "ideal of maturity prescribes self-sufficiency, self-help, competence in managing one's own affairs, a display of unshakable strength in the face of adversity, the ability to seek and organize one's own pleasures and to ward off pain effectively, skill in seeking our own sources of contact and support, capacity for making friends, ability to earn one's own money, and strength to be a good spouse or parent or a satisfied single adult" (p. 109). Thus, independence is viewed as a critical component of the very ability to connect with and relate meaningfully to others. A fourth personal setback is the loss of time, especially in the sense that one is running out of available time: Reality testing suggests that with more personal time behind one, there is less time ahead. The future is no longer a virtually endless stretch. And there is still so much to do, there are so many projects to start or finish, so many longings that should be fulfilled, (p. 110) In addition, there are persons who feel that "so many repairs must still be made of things done poorly in the past, so many faults to be set straight, so much atonement to be undertaken for previous transgressions" (p. 1 10). Little wonder, then, that the very feeling that one is aging tends to promote a degree of agitation, restlessness, or hurry. To be sure, these feelings are found among persons in mid-life too, but there seems to be a greater sense of urgency in the later years. An interesting complicating factor here is that exemption from work "puts much new chronological time at a person's disposal," but one "may not know at all what to do with this time; it is unstructured" (p. 110). Hence the conundrum of "too little time on the one hand, too much on the other hand; too little for personal synthesis and further maturation, too much for dreaming, trifles, and busy work" (p. 110). Such "situational ambiguity" may, in turn, "activate all kinds of personal Springer</page><page sequence="9">J Relig Health (2012) 5 1 :479-497 487 ambivalence," thus increasing the agitation and making "the task of coping all the more strenuous" (p. 110).8 Finally, Pruyser adds to these four noteworthy experiences of loss "a more basic meaning of loss to which these particular losses owe much of their pain" (p. 110). This is the loss of object relations. He points out that the essence of object relations for his purposes here is that "selfhood is a developmental and dynamic function of our relations to other persons, and vice versa" (p. 1 10). Our nascent selves "emerge from loyalties we have toward others, and the love of others is co-determined by the love we have of ourselves" (p. 110). Thus, even as every gain in loving, being loved, and being lovable is satisfying and joyful, so "every loss is frustrating, saddening, and anger-provoking" (p. 111). The very things we value - such as money, independence, success, competence, pro- ductivity, dignity, strength, fertility, a healthy and reliable body - are "taken as proofs of our lovability when they come our way," and they are also "intertwined with our love for the significant persons in our lives who modeled them as virtues" (p. 111). Consequently, any loss that is experienced as something being taken away from us by somebody (whether a person, group, government, fate, or god) creates a sense that "we are no longer loved as we were before and can no longer love in return as before" (p. 111). Worse yet is the fact that the losses we sustain "may not only be taken as signs of rejection but also become charged with irrational feelings of guilt and shame, which may turn them into punishment for transgressions or proofs of our disloyalties" (p. 1 1 1). To maintain adequate self-regard in the face of any loss is therefore "a taxing proposition" (p. 1 1 1). Pruyser concludes his discussion of the losses sustained in the later stages of the aging process with the observation that older persons, especially the very old, are prone to experience any or all of these losses as abandonment. He explains: "Being seen and heard in the marketplaces of life depends to a large extent on one's own initiative, drive, and agility; if any of these functions diminish, as they do in aging, through sensory and motor deficiencies and depletion of energy, one is simply less seen and heard, unless others make helpful efforts to give him a forum" (p. 111). However, such extra efforts by others are frequently not made, whether from forgetfulness or malignant rejection. In either case, "the aged person may well feel abandoned" (p. Ill ), and this very feeling of abandonment may "re-enliven old childhood memories of abandonment and mourning" and "it may be experienced more intensely by knowing that one is approaching the ultimate abandonment of death" (p. 111). As we consider his discussion of these losses, it is well worth noting that Pruyser refers to them as "personal setbacks," for the very word setback has the connotation of "a reversal" or an "interruption in progress" (Agnes 2001, p. 1312). Thus, they are an impediment to one's forward movement. It is also noteworthy that in his descriptions of individual losses he uses language like "progression" and the expectation that one will "move in one direction" on the one hand and "regression" on the other. He also suggests that a loss may "accelerate the aging process," implying that the forward movement may be faster than it ought to be, and that the forward movement is no longer perceived as a "virtually endless stretch" but as limited in time or duration. If the aging process is one of forward movement (and not a triphasic process of pro- ceeding upward to a peak and then declining again), the losses to which Pruyser draws our attention present various impediments and roadblocks in this regard, and there is also the 8 In his comments on the eighth stage of the life cycle {ego integrity vs. despair) Erikson (1963) suggests that despair "expresses the feeling that the time is now short, too short for the attempt to start another life and to try out alternate roads to integrity" (p. 269). â Springer</page><page sequence="10">488 J Relig Health (2012) 5 1 :479^97 issue or question of the final or ultimate goal toward which this forward movement is directed. The simplest and most straightforward answer is that, even as the aging process begins with birth, it necessarily ends or terminates in death. (The belief in a personal afterlife is not based on the view that this afterlife is integral to the aging process; rather, it is a new beginning, a new birth, as it were.) If so, we have reason to raise questions as to the very use of the language of "progression" for forward movement and "regression" for backward movement, especially if death is not viewed as an especially desirable goal, end point, or terminus of the aging process. I will return to this issue later. But first, we need to consider Pruyser' s discussion of the potential gains in the aging process. Potential Gains in Aging Pruyser begins his discussion of the potential gains with the observation that up to this point he seems "to have only reinforced the iconic illusion of a low-high-low sequential pattern" (p. 111). He agrees that this is, in fact, the case, for much as he "struggled to extricate myself from it, I have demonstrated how much I am still its captive" (p. 111). This being so, he asks the reader at this juncture "to consider the fact that many aging persons seem to take their successive losses rather well and do not succumb prematurely to the strains of aging" (p. 111). Pruyser asks: "Do they have exceptional coping skills, or does the aging process itself bestow gains and compensations for the losses it imposes?" (pp. 11-112). He believes that there is much to be said for the latter explanation, for the very fact that many individuals - not just the "happy few" - appear to age with "a good deal of tranquility and considerable happiness" suggests that they are "making some psychic gains and experiencing some satisfactions along with the losses they sustain" (p. 112). But what are these gains? Pruyser suggests that one such gain is the gradual discovery of some good and wholesome adult dependencies. He explains: "When the children have grown up, the parents begin to see how much they depend on their children's liveliness, attestations of love and goodwill, and their presence as objects of caring" (p. 112). Sometimes this realization is a reaction to the "empty nest" syndrome as spouses, "after having taken each other for granted, discover how much they need one another" (p. 1 12). Also, the necessity of planning for retirement may result in the discovery of how much we have depended on our regular work for daily satisfactions and mental equilibrium, and we may begin to take a new look at our former strivings for independence, finding some of it suspect: "By hindsight, some of it was very demanding and overdone, and the promoted ideal of independence now proves to have been rather fictitious" (p. 1 12). With this realization, one may begin to relax and to acknowledge "the healthiness of some dependencies" and to entertain the thought that "some specific dependencies (e.g., on one's children, pension plans, friendships, recreation, simpler housing, mass transportation) are likely to increase with the years" (p. 112). A second gain is the satisfaction that results from redefining one 's own status. Formerly defined by occupation, income, and social approval of one's demonstrated zeal for 'making it' - all of which are external status definitions - "the status of the person who knows that he is aging becomes increasingly defined by himself, in terms of his personal criteria" (p. 112). The achievement motive and the social approval one receives for it may give way to "a search for idiosyncratic satisfactions; one begins to think of what he really likes to do, or what he will do the moment he retires" (pp. 1 12-113). Whatever forms this takes, one "finds a new niche for himself that tallies with his native bent and preferences rather than Springer</page><page sequence="11">J Relig Health (2012) 5 1 :479-497 489 with the dictates of upward mobility and pressures for conformity" (p. 1 13). Thus, "Fateful as aging may be in many ways, it also gives new margins of independence for taking a greater hand in shaping one's own role and status" (p. 113). A third potential gain, one that may build on the second, derives from the fact that aging affords the opportunity for discovering one 's own inner world as a worthy complement of, or alternative to, the external world to which one has been enslaved for so long: "With a good deal of experience and many memories to look back on, one is in a position to take stock of oneself' (p. 1 13), and especially to discover that much of the self was thwarted by undue attention to the "masked" self of social expectation and that keen strivings for action cut oneself off from "the satisfactions of contemplation" (p. 113). These self discoveries may, in turn, enable one to develop new ways of relating to the external world, to embrace "an ever wider circle of humanity with whom one can identify without pointed personal or parental narcissism" (p. 113). One may befriend whomever one chooses to befriend, to enjoy encounters with a great variety of people from all walks of life, and become "less afraid of slurs of eccentricity" (p. 1 14). A fourth potential gain is the relaxing of defenses: "With greater and more profound knowledge of the inevitable ambiguities of life and acceptance of irreducible ambivalence of one's own feelings, unpleasant realities can be faced with less denial, and negative affects or dubious propensities are no longer so prone to lead to reaction formation" (p. 114). Moreover, the hyper- vigilance promoted by the rat race image of life "can calm down to normal alertness" and some motives for defense "begin to change, not the least of which is the reduction in drive level that many aging persons experience" (p. 114). For example, sexual attitudes and activities can become more relaxed, neuroticism tends to diminish with aging (albeit with intermittent moments of temporary exacerbation), and "every diminution of a defense yields a quantum of energy that can now be put to freer use" (p. 114). To put these freed-up energies to use, some older persons seek or create work. This may in some instances be "a defensive maneuver against the imminence of death," as a means either to avoid thinking about death or to consign it to a distant future date because there is so much that needs to be accomplished in the meantime. But Pruyser believes that it is likely to be much more than that, for "work structures time and space, as well as per- sonality," and "some work produces gifts that convey love symbolically," such as things that grandparents make for their children and grandchildren. A fifth potential gain is a newly discovered capacity to live in the present. If in earlier stages of life one was "rushing toward the future with feverish expectations and deep worries," older persons often "enjoy more because what they enjoy is now, in the present moment" (p. 1 14). These pleasures may be small and unspectacular but they are real. In the case of religious individuals, "the faith that sustained them in dark moments of the past, perhaps defensively, is now an enjoyable cosmology that beautifies and validates their present days" (pp. 114-115). This allusion to religious faith in the context of a discussion of the older persons' capacity to live in the present prompts Pruyser to comment briefly on two related issues, the first concerning the fact that persons in the later stages of life tend to think more than they did previously about their own "approximate life span." Some believe on the basis of intuition or family statistics that their life span will be longer rather than shorter. Some, on the same basis, anticipate otherwise. In either case, being old "means having to prepare oneself for death, pondering its meaning, or seeking a meaningful relation to its closeness" (p. 115). Springer</page><page sequence="12">490 J Relig Health (201 2) 5 1 :479-497 The second issue concerns developmental psychology and, more specifically, the contrast between the minute age-specific groups into which the young have been subdi- vided and the tendency to lump "the aged" together into a single group despite the fact that they may span as many as four or five whole decades. Pruyser observes: "Despite efforts at conceiving some subdivision, I am not sure that any compelling developmental distinctions have yet been made with a holistic tenor; most of them are of situational, fiscal, medical, or physiological orientation, or based on rather arbitrary chronological age brackets" (p. 1 15). He suggests that we really do not yet know what the feasible distinctions are because we have been so ideologically resistant to investigating the process of aging.9 A sixth potential gain that may occur in the later stages of the aging process is the aging person's capacity to make identifications or re-identifications with the idealism of youth and to take vicarious pleasure in their activism. Pruyser suggests that a generational factor may be operating here: Skipping the intervening generation with its dedication to thought control and behavior shaping and its penchant forjudging and disciplining, aging persons often feel attracted to youth and deal with young people in a relaxed way, tolerant of their foibles and positively charmed by their idealism and venturesomeness. Conversely, many young people feel attracted to the aged, finding them surprisingly congenial and avant-garde in comparison with the generation of their parents, (p. 115) Pruyser adds that the delight in one's own grandchildren "partakes of these qualities" (pp* 115-116). At the same time, the older person's identification with the idealism of youth transcends narrowly defined family associations and loyalties for "the rediscovery of youth and its goodness amounts to a carefree caring that stands in contrast to the anxious (and more narcissistic) caring that prevailed during the years of parental responsibility" (p. 1 16). Conversely, the older person's identification with the idealism of youth may also be an expression of the desire to reconnect with the youth who continues to live inside of oneself (See Capps 2011a). A seventh potential gain in the later stages of the aging process is that aging gives a new freedom for revealing one's innermost thoughts. Pruyser believes that this freedom "pertains to many ordinary people and is not confined to luminaries" who, in their advanced years, share their personal credos with the public. He describes this new freedom: However honest and open a person may have been before, aging gives him a new candor for speaking without inhibitions. He reaps the satisfactions of a delayed honesty and a latter day openness that exceed everything he has been before. He has less fear of mockery and retaliation; he can now emotionally afford to show his heart in his reasoning, (p. 116) 9 I have addressed this issue in my The Decades of Life: A Guide to Human Development (Capps 2008b). I propose in this book that Erik Erikson's well-known concept of the life cycle may be adapted to the decades of life, with each stage comprising one full decade. Because his model consists of eight stages each of which is given a psychosocial designation (i.e., basic trust vs. basic mistrust, autonomy vs. shame and doubt, initiative vs. guilt, identity vs. identity confusion, intimacy vs. isolation, generativity vs. stagnation^ and integrity vs. despair) this would have meant that the life cycle would cover a life span of 79 years. So I added two additional stages for the 80-89 and 90-99 decades (release vs. control and desire vs. struggle). I considered adding a stage for years 100-109 but decided that persons who have lived a full century or more have won the right to call this decade whatever they chose. Incidentally, this conception not only addresses the problem of lumping all older persons together but also the other issue that Pruyser mentions, that the young have been subdivided into minute age-specific groups. Springer</page><page sequence="13">J Relig Health (2012) 51:479-497 491 For some, this freer spirit leads to "an appropriate militancy in securing one's rights, or in doing battle for any oppressed part of humanity" (p. 116). Karl Menningens activism for prison reform in his later years is among the examples he mentions. Pruyser concludes his discussion of the potential gains of aging by returning to the iconic illusion with which he began and, more specifically, with reference to what he had called the homeliest form of the artistic renditions of this illusion. He writes: If these peculiar gains of aging are taken into account, without denying the losses that also occur, life seems no longer to fit the iconic illusion of the low-high-low sequence. A new image shapes up; it is as if someone put a bouquet of flowers in the right hand vase that stands on the Victorian mantelpiece. It has the power to distract our gaze from the dominance of the clock in the middle, (p. 117) He adds that this "botanical association is no whimsical happenstance," and that it has been made before. He cites one of Johann P. Eckermann' s conversations with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in which Goethe, commenting on his review of letters he has written over the years, observed that he can now see quite clearly "how one has in every age of life certain advantages and disadvantages in comparison with earlier or later years." For example, "in my forties I was about some things as clear and clever as I am today, and in many respects even better; but now in my eighties I have yet some advantages which I would not exchange for the ones I had then." Eckermann responded, "While you are saying this, I envisage the metamorphosis of plants, and I understand very well that one would not like to return from the period of bloom to the time of leafing, nor from the stage of seed and fruit to the time of blossoms." Goethe replied, "Your simile catches my meaning per- fectly," and he noted that "a well-lobed, mature leaf' would not choose to "go back from its freest unfolding into the oppressive closeness of the cotyledon" (quoted on pg. 1 17). 10 It is noteworthy that Pruyser concludes his article with this conversation between Goethe and Eckermann because it represents the aging process as one of forward move- ment and also portrays an older man in his eighties declaring, in effect, that he would not "like to go back" to an earlier time in his life. Thus, this conversation supports Pruyser' s view that the later years of the life span are not ones in which one experiences a downward movement from a higher peak but one of forward movement. It is also interesting to note that Goethe uses the forties as a convenient reference point as the sonnet by William Shakespeare to which Pruyser refers at the beginning of his article alludes to "forty winters," the point at which one begins to lose one's youthful beauty and begins to appear like a "tatter'd weed." Thus, Shakespeare, too, employs a "botanical association," but in this case the change is not from "the oppressive closeness of the cotyledon" to the "freest unfolding" of the "well-lobed, mature leaf" but from the beautiful flower to the tattered weed. If we view Shakespeare's image according to the forward movement model of the aging process, we might agree with Goethe's point about not wanting to go back to an earlier stage in our lives but at the same time question whether we really wanted to continue the forward movement. Or, to invoke the concluding sentence of Pruyser' abstract - "the life course is neither upward nor downward, but a forward movement full of new discoveries" - we might observe that these "new discoveries" are not (to invoke a culinary association) all "pea- ches and cream." These reflections and observations bring me to the proposal to which I alluded at the outset, i.e., a view or perhaps model of the aging process that consists of a 10 The cotyledon is "the first single leaf or one of the first pair of leaves produced by the embryo of a flowering plant" (Agnes 2001, p. 330). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="14">492 J Relig Health (201 2) 5 1 :479-497 forward movement accompanied by detours and occasional backward steps. I believe, in fact, that some of the potential gains that Pruyser identifies are actually the consequence or result of the aging person's ability to follow a few detours and take a few backward steps rather than simply forging ahead. Detours and Backward Steps To initiate discussion of this proposal, I want to return to Pruyser' s reference to "the vital balance" that "quivers between the two forces of life and death, always precariously," and his suggestion that "death has the edge in the long run by the sheer weight of its inertia" (p. 105). The phrase "the vital balance" is the title of a book by Karl Menninger (Menninger 1963) for which Martin Mayman and Paul Pruyser were contributing authors. In Menninger : The Family and the Clinic , Friedman (1990) discusses at some length the role that Freud's theory of the death instinct (Freud 1959) played in Menninger' s devel- opment of his concept of "the vital balance." A detailed summary of this discussion would take us too far afield, but it is noteworthy that Menninger embraced Freud's theory of an all-powerful death instinct, and that his books Man Against Himself (Menninger 1938) and Love Against Hate (Menninger 1942) were based on Freud's theory. Friedman writes: "By developing Freud's concept of a deep, powerful force of thanatos (the death instinct) emerging and contesting eros (the life instinct) within a person, Karl sought to outline in these volumes what he regarded as Freud's most important message - man's tragic in- traphysic struggle" (p. 121). On the other hand, Friedman believes that in both volumes Menninger "treated the death instinct as a less ominous force than Freud had given his followers to believe," that he not only "claimed that its manifestations were detectable in a clinical examination" but also "characterized it as an eminently manageable phenomenon" (p. 121). This is not to say that his books were "distortions or popularizations" of Freud's dual instinct theory. Rather, they were a reflection of the fact that "in certain areas, Karl openly and thoughtfully departed from key Freudian tenets" (p. 121). For example, in Man Against Himself Menninger argued that within each person there is an equilibrium between eros and thanatos and that it is often unstable. By means of this equilibrium concept he sought to explain why some persons commit suicide and others do not. Thus, in contrast to Freud's view of eros and thanatos as absolute qualities, Menninger saw them as the two polar extremes on a continuum. In this way, "Freud's clash between the two instincts was reformulated so that the focus was no longer on either of the polar extremities but on how and why a person moved from one pole to another," and this movement "became the crucial element of concern for the skilled diagnostician" (p. 124). Friedman suggests that Menninger' s The Vital Balance is clearest presentation of "his concept of shifts on a continuum between eros and thanatos" (p. 125). 11 11 In a discussion of the dual-drive theory in a section on motivation in the second of two chapters of The Vital Balance (Menninger 1963) on "Toward a Theory of Human Behavior" Menninger and his colleagues have a rather extensive footnote reference to Freud's theory of the death instinct. They put forth several critiques of Freud's theory, including his view that the repetition compulsion, which they consider to be "a purely psychological concept," can be "nearly equated" with "the physicist's concept of entropy" from which he "derived his death instinct" (pp. 116-117). They also suggest that "his use of Weissman's germ- plasm theory seems fallacious" for the "organism never was 'dust' ; if it dies it becomes dust but does not return to it" (p. 1 17). It is perhaps ironic that, in their view, Freud was, in effect, misled by the biblical view £) Springer</page><page sequence="15">J Relig Health (20 1 2) 5 1 :479-497 493 Friedman's discussion of the connection between Menningens "vital balance" and Freud's theory of the dual instincts of life and death invite us to take a brief look at Freud's own presentation of the theory in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (Freud 1920/1959). By doing so, we will find that it has direct relevance to Pruyser's view that the aging process is essentially one of forward movement. Freud's theory of the death instinct is presented in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (Freud 1920/1959) in his discussion of the compulsion to repeat (or repetition compulsion). He notes that this compulsion is especially found among children. With adults a joke produces almost no effect when heard for a second time and it is hard to persuade someone who enjoyed reading a book to re-read it immediately (p. 66). Not so with children. They "will never tire of asking an adult to repeat a game that he has shown them or played with them" and "if a child has been told a nice story, he will insist on hearing it over and over again rather than a new one" and will also insist that the repetition is "an identical one and will correct any alterations of which the narrator may be guilty" (p. 66). Freud contends that this difference between adults and children is due to the fact that the children's behavior is more deeply instinctual than that of the adult. If so, this means that the compulsion to repeat is a manifestation "of a universal attribute of instincts and perhaps of organic life in general which has not hitherto been clearly recognized or at least not explicitly stressed," i.e., "that an instinct is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things which the living entity has been obliged to abandon under the pressure of external dis- turbing forces; that is, it is a kind of organic elasticity, or, to put it another way, the expression of an inertia inherent in organic life" (p. 67, emphasis in original). If there is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things then "it would be in contradiction to the conservative nature of the instincts if the goal of life were a state of things which had never yet been attained" (p. 70). On the contrary, it would need to be "an old state of things, an initial state from which the living entity has at one time or other departed by the circuitous paths along which its development leads" (p. 70). And if we accept the view that "everything living dies for internal reasons - becomes inorganic once again - then we shall be compelled to say that 4 the aim of all life is death ' and, looking backwards, that 4 inanimate things existed before living ones' " (pp. 70-71, emphasis in original). There was a time when all that existed was inanimate matter. Then, however, a force "of whose nature we can form no conception" evoked the "attributes of life" in inanimate matter. This created a "tension" in the living being between its animate state and its inanimate state, and this tension resulted in the first instinct coming into being, "the instinct to return to the inanimate state" (p. 71). Initially, it was still an easy matter for a living substance to die, but as time went on, "decisive external influences altered in such a way as to oblige the still surviving substance to diverge ever more widely from its original course of life and to make ever more complicated detours before reaching its aim of death" (p. 71). He concludes: "These circuitous paths to death, faithfully kept to by the conser- vative instincts, would thus present us with the picture of the phenomena of life" (p. 71). I find it noteworthy that Freud introduces the idea of detours and suggests that they make the path to death more circuitous. The dictionary defines detour as "a roundabout way; deviation from a direct way" and as "a route used when the direct or regular route is closed to traffic" (Agnes 2001, p. 393). Thus, a detour is an impediment to forward movement toward one's destination. Some detours are rather inconsequential as they may Footnote 1 1 continued expressed in God's statement to Adam: "By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return" (Gen. 3:19 NRSV). Springer</page><page sequence="16">494 J Relig Health (2012) 51:479-497 only involve going a few blocks out of one's way. Others are more significant, taking one several miles out of one's way before reconnecting with the highway or road on which one was originally traveling. In these cases one can "lose" a substantial amount of time which, in turn, may cause one to arrive much later at one's destination than one originally planned. As a result, detours can be frustrating and, in some cases, they can have serious conse- quences (e.g., when an ambulance transporting a desperately ill person to a hospital encounters a major detour). If, however, the destination is death or the return of the living organism to its inanimate state, we are likely to view detours quite differently. Freud suggests that when the instinct to return to the inanimate state first came into existence it was still an easy matter "for a living substance to die" for "the course of its life was probably only a brief one," its direction being determined "by the chemical structure of the young life" (p. 71). When this way of looking at things is applied to the human organism, we are likely to view detours as a godsend, and may even think of the deity as the one who not only evoked the attributes of life in inanimate matter (the original creative act) but also as the one who implanted in our progenitors the very idea of detours (thus endowing the human species with its own creative capacities). In any event, the idea of detours has important implications for Pruyser's view of the aging process as a forward movement. In addition to the idea of detours , Freud suggests that there may also be a backward movement. This suggestion occurs in a discussion of the sexual instincts. Invoking his earlier observation that external pressures have played a major role in causing the organism to diverge from its path toward its original inanimate state, he notes that some organisms have successfully resisted these external pressures and as a result have remained up to the present time at their original, uncomplicated level. But other organisms have developed internal features (he refers to them as germ-cells) that, over time, have taken on a life of their own, separate from the organism as a whole. These germ-cells "work against the death of the living substance and succeed in winning for it what we can only regard as potential immortality, though that may mean no more than a lengthening of the road to death" (p. 74). Freud suggests that these germ-cells would not be able to work against the death of the living substance if they were not supported by instincts that are no less conservative than the death instinct, but in a very different way, for these instincts seek to bring the organism back "to earlier states of living substance" (p. 74). Thus, they are conservative in that they are "peculiarly resistant to external influences" but also conservative in the sense that "they preserve life itself for a comparatively long period" (p. 74). These are "the true life instincts" and they "operate against the purpose of the other instincts, which leads, by reason of their function, to death" (p. 74). As a result, the life of the organism moves with "a vacillating rhythm": "One group of instincts rushes forward so as to reach the final aim of life as swiftly as possible; but when a particular stage in the advance has been reach, the other group jerks back to a certain point to make afresh start and so prolong the journey " (pp. 74-75, emphasis added). Freud goes on to discuss his claim that the only life-preserving instincts are the sexual instincts, and that there is no basis for arguing that other "higher" human qualities are also instinctual. He challenges, for example, "the belief that there is an instinct toward per- fection at work in human beings" (p. 76). 12 I will not pursue this discussion here as this would take us too far afield. What interests me here is the idea that we possess internal 12 He also indicates that these life instincts are separate from - and even in opposition to- the ego. They are no more natural allies of the ego than is the death instinct. I take this to mean that the backward movement under consideration here is not related to or comparable with the "regression in the service of the ego" as Springer</page><page sequence="17">J Relig Health (2012) 51:479-497 495 instincts for some rudimentary form of animate life and that these instincts arrest the organism's movement toward its final destination - which is death - by "jerking back to a certain point to make a fresh start and so prolong the journey " (p. 75). 13 This is not a detour caused-or made possible-by external pressures but a backward thrust under the aegis of internal pressures. It is noteworthy that Freud uses the word prolong , which means "to lengthen or extend in time or space" (Agnes 2001, p. 1148). The journey is prolonged in part because one retraces one's steps to an earlier spot or place but then, having done so, one retraces them again as one continues forward. Thus, the "jerking back" means that this part of the journey will not only be repeated but that it will take twice as long as it did originally. Thus, we have here the paradox that a loss is actually a gain. This would mean that the losses and gains that Pruyser identifies in the later stages of the aging process are not necessarily opposed but may, instead, have a dialectical relationship with one another. Conclusion As we consider and reflect upon the implications of Freud's discussion of the death and life instincts for the aging process, it is important that we keep in mind the fact that he does not challenge, much less deny, the fact that the destination is death. In fact, he reinforces this fact by emphasizing that the inanimate state is the living organism's primary aim or goal. On the other hand, the idea that this movement toward death is complicated by two factors - external pressures that make the route more circuitous and internal pressures that prolong the journey - make the forward movement itself a more complex affair and this very complexity is potentially beneficial. I would suggest, in fact, that these two complications tend to increase, not decrease, in the later stages of the aging process. They have been there all along, but I think that as the organism comes closer to the end of the journey, these pressures are more, not less likely to manifest themselves. While this likelihood has implications for longevity itself (see Capps Footnote 12 continued formulated by Kris (1952/1964) and presented, interestingly enough, in his chapter on "the psychology of caricature" (p. 177). 13 It is noteworthy that Freud uses the metaphor of the journey in his portrayal of the life of the organism. In his foreword to Aichhorn' s (1925/1968) Wayward Youth he notes that of all the fields in which psycho- analysis has been applied "none has aroused so much interest, inspired so much hope, and accordingly attracted so many capable workers as the theory and practice of child training" (p. v). He suggests that this is easy to understand because the child "has become the main object of psychoanalytic research and in this respect has replaced the neurotic with whom the work began," and that this change is due to the fact that analysis has itself "revealed that the child lives on almost unchanged in the sick patient as well as in the dreamer and the artist," has "thrown a flood of light on the instinctual forces and impulses which give the childish being its characteristic features," and "has traced the paths of development which proceed to maturity" (p. v.). Thus, "It is no wonder that expectation was aroused that psychoanalytic work would prove valuable in education, the purpose of which is to guide the child on his way to maturity, to encourage him, and to protect him from taking the wrong path" (p. v, emphasis added). I would simply add that if this paper were about the early rather than the later stages of the aging process, there would be more emphasis on the problem of determining the right road or path to embark upon, and it would undoubtedly focus on the other side of the dependency/independency dynamic that Pruyser discusses in relation to one of the gains of older adulthood (see also Capps 201 lb). On the other hand, the issue of determining the right road is directly germane to the problem of dementia (especially the much discussed Alzheimer's type), for one of the common features of its advanced stages is the tendency to, quite literally, lose one's way or wander aimlessly about (see Capps 2008a, pp. 26-27). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="18">496 J Relig Health (201 2) 5 1 :479-497 and Carlin 2009), it also has implications that are more qualitative in nature (i.e., they concern what are commonly called "quality of life" issues). I will not attempt here to determine whether some of Pruyser' s losses and gains are more conducive to the quality of the forward movement than others, much less attempt to identify them. But I believe that Freud has given us some guidance in this regard by means of his view that there are two ways in which the forward movement may be altered or modified - either through detours that make the forward movement more circuitous or through backward steps that prolong the journey. Also, it may be that it is of the very nature of old age that one will be less frustrated and impatient with the detours and instead be more attracted to the views that one would otherwise not experience at all, and that one will not be quite so upset when one is forced to retrace one's steps because one knows that in this case losing time is itself a gain, not a loss.
