<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Pembroke College New Testament and A Group of Unusual English Evangelist- Symbols* In Memoriam Francis Wormald ELIZABETH PARKER McLACHLAN Rutgers University i. The Manuscript as a Whole: Questions of Style and Origin. In the early fourteenth century, Reginald of Denham, Sacrist of the Benedictine monastery of Bury St. Edmunds in Suf- folk, presented to the abbey a fine New Testament. The fact is attested by an inscription on the first page of writing in the codex, now MS. 120 of Pembroke College, Cambridge.1 Reginald's gift was imposing in size-410 x 270 mm.- and handsomely illuminated with many ornamental initials and five historiated ones in body-color and gold. At the time of his donation the manuscript, which dates from the mid- dle of the twelfth century or slightly later, was already venerable. Now bound with it is a prefatory series of twelve pages of Gospel scenes drawn in pen-and-ink outline with touches of color, which probably were not part of the origi- nal manuscript, being approximately a decade earlier in date and differing slightly in dimensions.2 The prefatory minia- tures may well have been made at Bury St. Edmunds;3 the text almost certainly was not, and the question of its origin and place in English illumination poses several interesting problems of a sort common to many English manuscripts. There can be little doubt that the Pembroke 120 text originated somewhere other than in the Bury Scriptorium. Its hand is not typical of Bury manuscripts, although such details as the nota (--() for est suggest that it is English, and not Flemish as M. R. James at one point supposed.4 The text itself offers no direct clues, being apparently typi- cal of that in the twelfth-century English Great Bibles. A colophon on f.182v gives the scribe's name as William,5 but is otherwise uninformative; his request that his name be written in the Liber Vitae does not necessarily imply that he was a monk of the abbey where the manuscript was produced, for associates in other monasteries, lay friends or benefactors might be included.6 The inference is, how- ever, that he wished to be recompensed in prayers rather than in cash, and was therefore perhaps a monk rather than a layman. The regularity and consistent excellence of the handwriting throughout suggest, in any case, that Wil- liam, whether cleric or layman, was a professional scribe. His writing, in double columns of 35 lines, is large, clear and compact (Fig. 1). Although it betrays as yet none of the incipient Gothic of fractured curves, it is given the overall appearance of angularity by sharply slanted serifs at the Figure 1. Prologue and capitula to Hebrews; Pembroke College, Cambridge, MS. 120, f. 173v. bottoms of minims and descenders. This effect is enhanced by the characteristic boxy shape of the trailing contraction for ae and of the forward-leaning ampersand. The rubrics, although less even, especially where less compact, than the script of the text, appear to be by the same hand: on occa- sion, as on f.173v, they repeat the same idiosyncrasies of spelling (Apochalypsin). The minor or rubricated initials in colored inks are com- pletely foreign to the characteristic Bury St. Edmunds flat- color style.7 Some contain human heads in profile among leaves (Fig. 1), carried out in a manner suggestive of St. Albans or Winchester influence;8 other details imply an 3</page><page sequence="2">Figure 2. Initial to II Timothy; Pembroke College MS. 120, f. 163v. Figure 3. Small Flourished M in text; Pembroke College MS. 120, f. 47v. acquaintance on the part of the scribe and decorator with products of the Durham scriptorium. The "split daisy-pet- al" motif mentioned by R. A. B. Mynors and the letter I interrupted by a transverse "pipe", rarely seen in other than Durham manuscripts, both occur frequently on the pages of Pembroke 120.9 Another characteristic feature found com- monly both in Durham books and in the text of Pembroke 120 is a broad, inverted trefoil crescent, employed in several ways to finish the flourish at the end of an initial (Fig. 1). Nowhere, however, is the typical coherent, organic Bury system of leafy sprays in curling rinceaux of two or three colors to be seen, a fact which suggests very strongly that the text was not written at Bury St. Edmunds. The major initials introducing various books of the New Testament are equally foreign to the style of Bury and as professional in appearance as the other elements of the text. While the greatest interest of Pembroke 120 resides in the iconography of its five historiated initials, to be dealt with below, the other New Testament books and their prologues are introduced by ornamental initials of great fantasy and richness, brilliantly executed in body-color and gold. His- toriated and ornamental initials alike are populated by monsters, birds and acrobats climbing among luxuriant foliage and blossoms. In a few cases, these ornamenal fig- ures tantalize with the possibility that they may represent or be derived or distorted from an original real subject drawn from proverb, legend or biblical history: in the end, however, they prove impossible to pin down in such a manner. One dragon, for instance, on f.163v (Fig. 2), form- ing the upright hasta of the initial P to II Timothy, holds a severed, bearded head in its paws, a motif that tempts one to thoughts of St. Edmund of Bury whose head, after his martyrdom by the Danes, was protected according to legend by a she-wolf until it could be reunited with his body. The head on f.163v, however, is not crowned and is held by a dragon, not a wolf. Thus there is no real evidence to sug- gest any intended iconographic significance in the motif, or to connect the manuscript's ornament with the abbey of Bury St. Edmunds. The same must be said of such motifs as the man standing on one foot on f.117 in the margin below the initial I to I John.'? In all of the body-color initials, draperies, wings and bodies display the broad shaded stripes of color characteris- tic of the Anglo-Norman school," shadowed in deeper shades of the main hue with occasional overlaid floral and other ornamental designs highlighted in white (Figs. 4-7). There are occasional suggestions of the clinging "damp- fold" treatment of drapery introduced to English book- painting by the artist Master Hugo in the great Bury Bible,'2 but, on the whole, the drapery in Pembroke 120's initials suggests rather a modified version of the close-hanging and relatively natural fold systems of the St. Albans Psalter miniatures.'3 The tendency for folds between the knees of seated figures to fan out broadly with an occasional extra eddy of drapery at the hemline, as in the case of St. Matthew on f.llv (Fig. 4), contrasts with the treatment of similar 4</page><page sequence="3">figures in the prefatory miniatures14 and confirms the view that these were not, in fact, drawn by the same hand as the initials.15 The foliage of the Pembroke 120 initials is colorful and varied, with occasional "Byzantine" or "Sassanian" blos- soms of moderate size, in no way similar to those of the great Bury Bible,16 and the "spurred leaves" (Figs. 2, 8) which were common in the mid-twelfth century at St. Al- bans and Winchester17 but less so at Bury St. Edmunds. In general the colors are lighter and brighter in hue than those of the Bury Bible, tending more to almost powdery reds, blues, greens and oranges than to the deep and unusual tones of olive green, crimson, indigo and violet favored by Master Hugo. In this they resemble other manuscripts of similar scale produced around the middle of the twelfth century, such as the Lambeth Bible, which is generally agreed to have been made at Canterbury.18 There are strong indications that the entire Pembroke New Testament, text and initials alike, is the work of a sin- gle hand. Both as copyist and as rubricist, the scribe appears much concerned with the even and balanced appearance of text on page. Thus he often stretches the letters of rubrics to fill one or two whole lines, or, alternatively, repeats the last minim of a word as a filler; both devices occur, for ex- ample, on f.173v (Fig. 1). The same considerations lead him to fit tag-ends of lines into spaces within the text, and in such cases the insert is always separated from the rest of the line by a crisply ornamental knot or flourish. Equal care is taken to bracket or mask an extra half-line at the bot- tom of a column, and similar treatment is often accorded to the running-title, which stretches across the top of each opening, in capitals of the same ink as the text. Corres- pondences of motif between many of these small orna- mental flourishes, in ink matching that of the text and clearly by the copyist himself (Fig. 3), and the more elabor- ate, middle-sized initials in colored inks, indicate that the latter, too, are the work of the scribe William. Correspon- dences, once more, in vocabulary and form between the medium-sized rubricated initials and the major ones in body-color and gold, suggest very strongly that the same hand was responsible for the text and for all its ornament. One notable detail is the dragon forming the base of the historiated initial L to St. Matthew on f.llv (Fig. 4). Only its near, right-hand claw has been painted in body-color; the far claw is merely outlined in the same red ink as the rubric letters immediately next to it, but the two are re- markably similar in form. Pembroke 120's text would thus appear to be the virtuoso production of a single person, who both copied and embellished the text and created the illuminated initials. And this scribe and illuminator, the William of the colophon, appears to have had a certain firm regard for his own artistic abilities, a pride in his craftsman- ship which led him not only to adorn the book with fine illuminated and ornamental initials, but also to embellish the script of the text itself to a degree that is unusual and idiosyncratic in English manuscripts of the period. Pembroke 120 thus offers to the scholar a positively be- wildering multitude and variety of clues. While the script cannot be matched with certainty to the characteristic hand of any known school, and the rubricated ornament points, if anywhere at all, north to Durham, the style and iconog- raphy of its rich and intriguing illuminated initials suggest relationships to several of the major twelfth-century Eng- lish scriptoria. In particular, the initial to St. Mark's Pro- logue, containing an author-portrait of the Evangelist with the four heads of the tetramorph and other unusual features (Fig. 8) suggests connections with St. Albans, Winchester and Canterbury, placing the work squarely in the center of a group of important and interrelated English manuscripts, and throwing into relief a specific peculiarity of English medieval iconography: the unusually close and explicit al- liance of the Apocalyptic Evangelist symbols with the pro- phetic vision of Ezekiel. As will be seen below, the strongest iconographic and stylistic links with Pembroke 120 are to be found in two St. Albans manuscripts, the Gospel-Book in Hereford Cathedral Library, MS.0.1.viii of the first half of the twelfth century, and another Gospel Book in Cambridge, Trinity College MS. B.5.3, of about 1200 A.D. The script and ornament of the Pembroke 120 text would date it between these two manu- scripts. But although the case for a St. Albans origin is thus very tempting indeed, neither the script nor the rubricated initial ornament will support a St. Albans attribution: there is no firm evidence that Pembroke 120 is itself a St. Albans product.19 Certain iconographic features suggest parallels with Canterbury, and the initial ornament also suggests con- nections with Durham and even Winchester, while varia- tions in the drapery style of figures in the historiated ini- tials, however much conditioned by the varied sizes of those initials, suggest even the possibility that models of differ- ent styles were employed.20 William, scribe and almost cer- tainly illuminator of the text of Pembroke 120, remains therefore an enigma, but very probably a member of that early number of professionals who, like the Alexis Master of the St. Albans Psalter, the Master of the Liessies Gospels, or the English Master of Sigena, travelled relatively widely and contributed to the spread of stylistic and iconographic motifs from workshop to workshop throughout England and even into continental Europe.2' His single known creation, the text of Pembroke 120, may thus be viewed as a more hybrid product than the majority of better-known English manuscripts that reflect the traditions of single scriptoria; but the striking unity of its workmanship, its consistently high quality, and above all the originality of its tetramorph St. Mark, render it well worthy of attention. ii. The Historiated Initials The initial L to St. Matthew of f.llv (Fig. 4) is the largest and most elaborate of the historiated initials in Pembroke 120. The gilded panels of its riser are linked by intricately 5</page><page sequence="4">crossed and knotted fleshy leaves typical of the manuscript, with shell-like terminations that grip or curl around their golden trellis. Their white-heightened blues, reds and rose echo in paler terms the bright hues of the panelled back- ground, whose outer rim of red inscribed MATHEUS en- closes an inner panel of blue sown with triplets of white dots. Before this ground, and framed by its arched shapes as if by an azure nimbus, the symbol of St. Matthew sits frontally, wings spread on either side of his golden halo, holding a closed book in his left hand and gesturing with his right. Taken in combination, the heavy, emphatically drawn eyes, the oddly vestigial ear and rounded chin, the overlong and slender fingers, especially the pointing index finger of the right hand, the long splayed toes of the bare feet, and the arrangement of the man's cloak over extreme- ly narrow shoulders so that he seems to have no upper arms or elbows, all offer affinities with the style of the St. Albans Psalter Master and his followers, including the artist of ff.l-6v of Pembroke 120,22 and even, with their decora- tive white highlights, to some of Master Hugo's treatments of drapery in the Bury Bible.23 But there are no direct cor- respondences. The most, perhaps, that one can say is that the miniature reflects more St. Albans influence and less of that of the Bury Bible than most major English manuscripts of contemporary date. As far as its iconography is concerned, the initial to Mat- thew is interesting enough but not uncommon, although the particular nature of St. Matthew's symbol does lend a cer- tain ambiguity to the identity of such a figure, a tension between Evangelist-portrait and Evangelist-symbol. The winged symbol of an Evangelist, with or without a human body, often accompanies the portrait of the Evangelist him- self in frontispieces to the books of the four Gospels and in other places where portraits of the Evangelists frequently occur.24 The tradition of vesting supernatural human fig- ures with the qualities and even some of the aspects of ani- mals, originally a characteristic of ancient Near Eastern religion, was a lively part of the Hebraic tradition25 and it is not entirely surprising to find, even in pre-Carolingian manuscripts, the figures of Evangelists who have become so far confounded with their symbols as to bear upon human bodies the heads of their animal-or supernatural-sym- bols or equivalents.26 The Evangelist, after all, like the angel, the cherub or the seraph-Ezekiel's Holy Creatures or those of the Apocalypse-was seen as the messenger of God, and was in some way held to have looked upon the face of God: to have received direct inspiration from him, if not actual experience of him in the person of Christ. In the case of Matthew, whose winged symbol has in any case "the likeness of a man," the result is solemn and ef- fective, reminiscent here perhaps in its arched architectural setting, of the angel at the Tomb of Christ; but it is hardly exotic or surprising. There is even less to surprise us in the iconography of the author-portrait in the initial P to I Peter on f.112 (Fig. 5) in which St. Peter, nimbed and tonsured, is seated front- ally within the loop, holding a closed book in his left hand Figure 4. Initial to Matthew; Pembroke College MS. 120, f. 1v. and the keys, his attribute, in his right. Although he is drawn on a smaller scale than Matthew and offers less in the way of detail for comparison, St. Peter's drapery does afford some points of interest. The hemline swirls in gener- ous and fluent curves around his feet, in a manner that suggests, although in rounder terms, an older Anglo-Saxon style.27 The oddly puckered line along his right leg, how- ever, broken by taut, ropey folds, calls to mind develop- ments of Master Hugo's Byzantinizing "wet-fold" style sub- sequent to the Bury Bible.28 The main question raised by this initial is why it alone, of all the Epistles, contains such an author-portrait. The initial L of the Prologue to the Gospel of Luke on f.45v (Fig. 6) displays both the type of grotesque which abounds in the illuminated initials of Pembroke 120, and a bust of the Evangelist symbol analogous to the figure of the winged man on f.llv. At the top of the initial is a half- length figure of the winged bull of St. Luke with human body, gold-nimbed and enclosed in a circular frame. The symbol's wings project beyond the frame; his head, seen as if from above, is tilted sharply to the left, and he points 6</page><page sequence="5">Figure 6. Initial to Prologue to Luke; Pembroke College MS. 120, f. 45v. Figure 5. Initial to I Peter; Pembroke College MS. 120, f.13. toward the opening words, Lucas Syrus, with his right hand. Of the human body, other than the hand, only the cloaked shoulders and a small area of the tunic below are visible. The Pembroke 120 artist's investing of the winged bull, symbol of St. Luke, with a human body, although here short- ened to half-length, is consistent with the treatment of the winged man of Matthew and, as will be seen, with that of the other Evangelist symbols in the series. On f.70 the initial I to the Gospel of St. John (Fig. 7) shows a similar treatment of the Evangelist's symbol, but with the addition of two other figures. The letter itself is composed of interwoven ornamental foliate bands very much in the manner of the L to Matthew on f.llv, and superimposed upon this structure are three single figures. At the top is Christ, seated with his feet on a rainbow, with- in a figure-eight mandorla. He is bearded, wears the cross- nimbus, and holds a book in his left hand; the right is raised in benediction. Below Christ, and separated from him by foliate interlace, a round medallion at the center of the ini- tial contains the winged and nimbed symbol of the Evang- elist John. Its eagle's head, in profile to the left, surmounts a full-length human body, apparently seated (no seat, how- ever, is shown) and garbed much like the Christ-figure above. Its outstretched human hands support an open scroll inscribed with the first words of John 1:1: In principio erat verbum. Below this, and again separated from it by foliate ornament, is the full-length standing figure of St. John the Baptist in a mandorla echoing that of Christ at the top of the letter. He is nimbed, heavily bearded, barefoot and clad in a mantle of skins over a drooping short tunic. With his right hand he makes a gesture of teaching or benedic- tion, and in his left he holds a scroll inscribed with John 1:6: Fuit homo missus a deo cui nomen erat iohannes, which falls diagonally across his body. Again, the style of these small-scale figures, and particularly here the drooping hem of St. John the Baptist's tunic, offer analogies with the St. Albans Psalter style. The symbol of John with human body corresponds with those of Matthew and Luke, and fol- lows the established pattern of this manuscript. The pres- ence of St. John the Baptist also seems logical; he is men- tioned in the first chapter of the Gospel, and, taken to- gether with the Evangelist and Christ, he contributes to a triad of prophecy, incarnation and account: all are aspects of the Word of John 1:1 introduced by the initial. The iden- tity of name, as well, would seem to suggest the pairing of John the Evangelist and John the Baptist, and it is by no means uncommon to find the two as pendants at the be- ginning of the Gospel of John and elsewhere.29 There is 7</page><page sequence="6">Figure 7. Initial to John; Pembroke College MS. 120, f. 70. also one coincidence of date between the two: June 24 was the anniversary both of the birth of John the Baptist and of the death of John the Evangelist. The two events are not celebrated on the same day in the liturgical calendar, how- ever since the feast of St. John the Evangelist had been moved to December 27, the date of the consecration of his basilica.30 It is the initial M of the Prologue to Mark on f.31, how- ever, that offers the greatest iconographic interest of any of the historiated initials (Fig. 8). The initial itself is relatively plain, and within it, against a gabled gold ground, the human-bodied symbol of the Evangelist Mark is shown full- length, seated frontally on a backless bench. He is barefoot and clad in robes of green and red over a blue tunic with loose sleeves. Again the drapery folds, shadowed in darker Figure 8. Initial to Prologue to Mark; Pembroke College MS. 120, f. 31. shades of the same color and heightened with white, are firmly and logically drawn except for a curlicued white high- light on the right forearm and an oddly-set decorative band across the left knee, as in the Matthew initial.31 With such points of stylistic comparison, however, the likeness of the St. Mark initial to those of the other Evangelists ends, and it enters the realm of the exotic and possibly unique. The human-bodied symbol of St. Mark is shown, as noted, full-length and seated frontally upon a bench. On his lap is placed a small portable writing-desk of a sort not uncom- mon in portraits of scribes; lying across it and hanging down in front is a blank scroll. The usual pens or inkhorns, however, are lacking; and St. Mark, or his symbol, is here engaged in cutting off his left thumb: his upper torso turns slightly to his left as he stretches out his left arm, the wrist 8</page><page sequence="7">projecting through the bars of the letter so that the hand, its back toward us, is braced against the frame of the initial. His right hand, stretched out in front of the bars of the M, holds a large knife with which he severs the thumb, blood spurting from the wound onto the white parchment of the ground. This action is attributed to St. Mark in the old pre-Vulgate prologue or Argumentum to his Gospel, which is in fact the text introduced by this initial:32 St. Mark was supposed, out of humility, to have thus amputated his thumb in order to render himself unfit to handle the elements of the Eucharist and therefore obviously to be disqualified for the priesthood. He was, however, ordained over his own objections and made Bishop of Alexandria. Although the incident is des- cribed in the ancient prologue and was later taken up in the Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine33 it does not appear to have been a popular subject for illustration, particularly in the earlier middle ages: other than the example in Pem- broke 120 only two, much later versions, differing radically in iconography both from each other and from Pembroke 120, are known to me. The first appears in the Gospel- Book of John of Troppau, dated 1368,34 which shows the incident as the sixth of twelve fields in a full-page mini- ature with events in the life of St. Mark;35 the second, noted already by M.R. James,36 occurs in the Bedford Hours, a French or Burgundian manuscript of ca. 1425 where again it is one of several scenes from the saint's life.37 These three images of St. Mark cutting off his thumb, widely separated in date and place of origin as well as in icono- graphy, are obviously independent of one another. In par- ticular, the later two are frankly narrative in context and purpose, forming parts of a sequence of illustrations of events in the saint's life, while the initial in Pembroke 120, although it does depart from the norm of the manuscript in depicting a specific event from the life of the subject, is much more hieratic and symbolic in intent and treatment. Its iconography may well have been suggested by the com- mon scene of a scribe sharpening his pen with just such a knife as that used by St. Mark in Pembroke 120. Pen- sharpening scribes, however, are generally shown drawing the knife toward them; even if based on such a model, the iconography of the St. Mark incident has been thoroughly adapted to its specific subject matter. A further peculiarity greatly enhances the hieratic and symbolic qualities of St. Mark's image in this initial. The Evangelist symbol is not merely human-bodied, but also a tetramorph. The lion's head is here surrounded by those of the other three symbols: the man, green-nimbed, in profile to the left; the eagle, blue-nimbed, at the top of the group, in profile to the right; the bull, with a green nimbus, at the right of the lion's head, tilted and looking to the right as on f.45v. A long blank scroll projects from behind the mouth of each of the three profile heads. The lion's head, at the.cen- ter of the configuration, is nearly frontal though turned slightly toward the right, and it alone is unnimbed, as though the gold background were intended as a glory enveloping the whole figure. Although human-bodied Evangelist symbols with single heads are not uncommon, occurring elsewhere in Pembroke 120 and in countless other instances in medieval art, this representation of a single Evangelist symbol with all four heads is a very rare one, and lends weight to contentions that zoomorphic Evangelist portraits, or anthropomorphic Evangelist symbols, are offshoots of the Ezekiel-tetramorph tradition.38 The two original textual sources of the iconog- raphy of Evangelist symbols, the four "Living Creatures" of Ezekiel's vision beside the river Chebar (Ezekiel 1:5-20) and those described in the Apocalypse (Apocalypse 4:6-11), are often confused in literature and art, for, from the early days of Christian theological writing, Ezekiel's vision of God was interpreted as prefiguring that described in the Apocalypse, while the Apocalyptic vision signified the ful- fillment in Christian terms of its Old Testament forerun- ner.39 The four Living Creatures were most commonly in- terpreted, in commentaries upon both books, as the four Evangelists.40 Just why the Ezekiel-motif of the tetramorph should in Pembroke 120 be applied solely to St. Mark, how- ever, is not clear. In medieval literature it is Christ himself who is generally described as the sum of the four,41 and in the thirteenth century the whole metaphor was interpreted solely in terms of St. Luke by Jacobus de Voragine.42 The connection with Ezekiel's vision in the Pembroke 120 initial is strengthened by another unusual feature: the half-length profile of a white-haired, bearded man in a three-quarter-roundel abutting the long left-hand stroke of the M, at a level just below the feet of the main figure and looking and pointing up at it. Like the symbol of St. Mark, he is set against a gold ground; he wears a short- sleeved tunic and a cloak, in which his left hand and arm are muffled. From the clenched fingers of his pointing right hand a long, blank scroll hangs down in a graceful diagonal curve balancing those emanating from the three outer heads of the tetramorph. This man is almost certainly to be identified, as James has already done,43 as the prophet Ezekiel, pointing to the embodiment of his vision: indeed, he appears in a similar position in an illuminated leaf in Avesnes (Fig. 9), which, as will be seen, is related to this initial in other ways as well.44 The St. Mark initial in Pembroke 120 thus has several features which are unusual in any case and certainly outside the pattern followed by the other historiated initials in the same manuscript. While St. Peter and the symbols of Mat- thew and John are shown holding a book or a scroll as gen- eral attribute of their role as authors, the symbol of St. Mark is shown as if engaged in the more active role of scribe, and also performing an act which refers to specific events in his life. And the connection between Evangelist symbol and Ezekiel-vision is very strongly emphasized, both by the in- clusion of the figure of the prophet himself, and by the presentation of the symbol as a tetramorph. It is this latter feature which offers a fuller context within which to set the initial's iconography. Apart from two primitive and idiosyncratic attempts to translate into pictorial form the visionary descriptions of 9</page><page sequence="8">Figure 9. St. Mark; Avesnes, Societe Archeologique et Historique. Figure 10. St. Matthew; Trinity College, Cambridge, MS. B. 5.3, f. 4v. Ezekiel and the Apocalypse,45 relatively few representa- tions of an actual Evangelist or Evangelist-symbol-as-tetra- morph have survived--oddly enough, in view of the vast number of representations of Evangelists with the single head of their own symbol or of single symbols with human bodies.46 With one possible exception however, a late and rather inexpressive tetramorph bust of St. Matthew in a Gospel-Book in Troyes,47 all the examples I have been able to find either belong to or are related to English manu- scripts from the second and third quarters of the twelfth century through the beginning, at latest, of the thirteenth. The interrelationships of this group are complex, and the manuscripts concerned originated at, or are related to, three of the major English scriptoria of the period: St. Albans, Winchester and Canterbury. The tetramorph of Pembroke 120 is identical with none of these, but exhibits points of relationship with all. The basic group of English or English-related images of tetramorphic Evangelist symbols comprises five manu- scripts: 1. Trinity College, Cambridge, MS. B.5.3, a Gospel-Book from St. Albans.48 This is one of the latest of the five manu- scripts, dating from ca. 1200 A.D., but offers the strongest comparisons with Pembroke 120. Two of its initials, those to the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, contain tetramorphic figures. On f. 4v, the initial L to Matthew (Fig. 10) contains the finest and latest English flowering of the motif of Evangelist-symbol-as-tetramorph, the four-headed winged man frontally seated, his left hand supported on a lap-desk and grasping a pen, his right holding out a blank scroll to- ward the text accompanying the initial, as if to suggest a connection with the word Liber toward which he is reach- ing. The gesture is awkward, however, and the position of his arm closely parallels that of St. Mark's right arm in Pembroke 120 (Fig. 8). On f. llv of the Trinity College Gospel-Book, the initial F to Luke has a fine, full-length tetramorphic bull, shown regardant, a blank scroll between its feet. A medallion at the top of the initial I to Mark on f.63v contains a nimbed and winged lion, with blank scroll, in the reverse position to the bull of St. Luke, but with only a single head; in a matching medallion at the foot of the letter is the bull of St. Luke, single-headed there, but otherwise resembling that on f. 1 llv. Between, in lozenge-shaped frames distributed along the I, are the eagle of St. John, full-length and frontal, and below it, the half-length figure of the winged man of Mat- thew. The initial I to John on f. 187v takes a similar form with the full-length eagle grasping a scroll in a quatrefoil at the top, the half-length winged man and half-length, oddly upturned, head and shoulders of the winged bull of St. Luke in medallions on the body of the letter below, and the full- length lion of St. Mark, as on f.63v, in a quatrefoil at its 10</page><page sequence="9">Figure 11. Initial with Tetramorph, Winchester Cathedral Library, MS. VIII, f. 11r. foot. Thus, even in the two initials which do not contain tetramorphs, the artist of Trinity College B.5.3, has taken care to include all four symbols, and indeed has given them almost equal emphasis. 2. London, Lambeth Palace Library, MS. 102, a copy of the Gospels of Luke and-John, glossed, of the late twelfth cen- tury, from St. Albans.49 On f.7, the initial F to St. Luke has a half-length figure holding a book and bearing four heads, all nimbed, on its shoulders: that of the ox is frontal, the lion on the left, the man on the right, and the eagle above. 3. Winchester, Cathedral Library, MS. VIII, Zacharias Chrysopolitanus' Harmony of the Gospels, In Unum ex quatuor,50 of the mid-twelfth century. On f.llr, in the initial D to the first prologue, St. Matthew is shown as a tetra- morph (Fig. 11). Six wings frame and partially cover a robed human, or perhaps more correctly, seraphic body. Human hands and feet project from the lowest set of wings; the man's head is central and surrounded, in the usual order, by those of the other three symbols. This initial is by a hand identified by Oakeshott as one responsible for some of the later decoration of the Winchester Bible, while the tetra- morph itself bears a considerable, though not total, re- semblance to the tetramorph in the Bible's Ezekiel initial, attributed to the "Master of the Morgan Leaf" (Fig. 12).51 4. Camarillo, California, St. John's Seminary, the Edward Lawrence Doheny Memorial Library, Ms. 7, a second copy Figure 12. Initial to Ezekiel, Winchester Cathedral, Bible, f. 172. of Zacharias Chrysopolitanus' Harmony of the Gospels, also of the mid-twelfth century.52 On f.12v, in the initial U to the third preface, St. Matthew is again shown as a tetra- morph as in Winchester VIII, and in a somewhat similar style, although here the human body is unrobed and covered by wings set with eyes (Fig. 13). Hands and feet project from the lowest pair, and the head of the man is set real- istically upon the winged shoulders. From a level between the shoulders and hands, and not as though from a common neck-stem, the profile heads of the lion and ox project laterally, to left and right respectively, while above the man's head may be seen the eagle's head and upper wing, in profile to the right. All four heads are nimbed. Apart from the fact that the manuscript is English, and belonged in the fifteenth century to the Benedictine monas- tery of Abbotsbury in Dorset, nothing is known of the origins of the work.53 The similarities borne by the tetra- morph-seraph on f.12v, however, to those in Winchester Cathedral MS. VIII and the Winchester Bible's Ezekiel ini- tial, together with the elaborate line-and-wash "Sassanian" blossoms that ornament this and other initials in the Do- heny manuscript, strongly suggest a connection with Win- chester: such rich "Sassanian" blooms were not, by the mid- twelfth century, the sole property of Master Hugo and Bury St. Edmunds, but may be seen in the Winchester Bible itself and in the Winchester Psalter, Cotton MS. Nero C. IV in the British Museum.54 11</page><page sequence="10">Figure 13. Initial with Tetramorph; Duheny Collection, Camarillo, MS. 9, f. 12v. 5. Avesnes-sur-Helpe, Societe Arch6ologique et Histo- rique, a full-page miniature of St. Mark (Fig. 9), one of two detached folios which originally belonged to the Gospel- Book of Wedric of Liessies, made for him between 1124 and 1147. The Gospel-Book itself was MS. 1151 in the Biblio- theque Municipale of Metz until its destruction in the second World War.55 The relationship between the Avesnes leaves, the Gospel-Book of Liessies, and the English Lambeth Bible has been demonstrated by C. R. Dodwell, whose conclusion is that they are all the work of an English artist.56 The Avesnes miniature shows St. Mark as scribe and author. He is seated under an arch, hips and legs frontal and upper torso turned slightly to his left, where he holds pen and knife poised over a blank scroll hanging from a draped and ingeniously cantilevered desk. His head, though nearly frontal, inclines slightly toward his work; perched on his right shoulder, the dove of the Holy Spirit, sign of divine inspiration, whispers into his ear. In the bottom right-hand corner of the miniature stands the rampant lion, symbol of St. Mark, front legs outstretched toward the Evangelist. His body is supported on his right hind foot, the left one being raised to touch two wheels set between him and the saint's footstool. The symbol has two pairs of multicolored wings set with eyes, and is a tetramorph: the four heads, un- nimbed, overlap as if sprouting from a common neck and as usual the ox, reddish in color as in Trinity College MS. B.5.3., faces right and the eagle is at the top of the group. In this example, he faces the Evangelist and appears to be holding the dangling end of St.Mark's scroll in his beak.57 The wheels at the lion's feet, more explicitly than in any of the other Evangelist-tetramorph miniatures, relate this symbol to the vision of Ezekiel as well as to that of the Apocalypse, although not they, but the symbol's wings, are set with eyes. This reference to Ezekiel is strengthened, as mentioned earlier, by a second, even more explicit one: set into the frame, in a half-medallion to the left of St. Mark's body, is the half-length figure of the prophet himself, hold- ing an open scroll inscribed with Ezekiel 1:6: Quatuor faties (sic) uni erant et quatuor pennae uni. His long white beard, profile presentation and pointing finger, taken with the half-medallion frame and the figure's relationship to the main miniature, offer parallels to the "Ezekiel" figure on f.32v of Pembroke 120 that are surely too close to be coinci- dental. The floral tracery of white highlights on St. Mark's knee in the Avesnes leaf, and the delicate crown with its crosspiece resembling a center-parting of the hair offer ad- ditional, though less important and less conclusive, corres- pondences.58 To this admittedly small family of English tetramorphic Evangelists or Evangelist symbols, may be added a number of related representations of Evangelist symbols with human bodies and single heads. The list includes, obviously, the other Evangelist symbols of Pembroke 120. We may in- clude also the half-length symbol of St. Mark in a medallion set at mid-point in the initial I to his Gospel in the no longer extant Gospels of Liessies, to which the Avesnes leaf described above originally formed a pendant.59 The lion's head in the Liessies Gospels was nimbed and frontal, and human hands held a scroll inscribed with Mark 1:2: Sicut scriptum est in Ysaia propheta. Again, the connec- tion between Evangelists and prophets is underlined. As in the Avesnes leaf, a frame enclosed the initial and the whole page of display script, its corners studded with medal- lions containing half-length figures of four men, one of them crowned, who gesture prophetically and hold in- scribed scrolls. An additional example, again of a lion-headed St. Mark, is to be found in a Gospel-Book at Hereford, Cathedral Library MS. O.l.viii, probably made at St. Albans about A.D. 1120,60 where St. Mark is shown, as in the Avesnes leaf, as the subject of a full-page miniature facing the first page of his Gospel on ff.45v-46 (Fig. 14). In their common adher- ence to the St. Albans figure and drapery style, in the frontal position of the figure with its splayed feet and fairly logical drapery folds, and the long tapering wing-ends, as well as the presentation of St. Mark's symbol as a human bodied scribe (here holding both pen and knife to a sheet of parch- ment shown in ambiguous relationship to an arcaded lap- desk), the Hereford St. Mark and the Pembroke initial show perhaps the closest relationship so far of any of the minia- tures discussed. But the lion's head in the Hereford manu- script sits alone upon the human shoulders, and there are 12</page><page sequence="11">Figure 14. St. Mark; Hereford, Cathedral Library, MS. o. I. viii, f. 45v. no further specific references to Ezekiel's vision, nor any other such symbolic images in the Hereford Gospels.61 The great Winchester Bible itself has two human-bodied Evangelist symbols in unfinished initials to the Gospels of Mark (Fig. 15) and John.62 St. Mark is shown seated fron- tally under an arch surmounted by fanciful turrets. The figure is drawn in ink outline only, and shows the Evangel- ist symbol full-length with a winged human body, left hand gesturing at an open book and right hand raised in front of his chest, the long index finger extended in a preaching or speaking gesture. His nimbed head is turned in profile to the right and is distinctly different from most of the ex- amples encountered thus far: the delicately scalloped out- line shows an elongated snout and ears set far back on the skull: it resembles a sheep or rodent of some sort far more than the traditional lion of St. Mark. The symbol of St. John is very similar in attitude, except that his hands are spread in balanced gestures to both sides of his body, and he is framed in a medallion and seated on an arc. Again there is apparently no further specific reference to Ezekiel's vision in either of the two Winchester initials. When examined in detail, the iconography of St. Mark's symbol in these manuscripts offers certain grounds for dis- tinguishing between two sub-groups or types: the main group A, to which Pembroke 120 belongs, shows a lion's Figure 15. Initial to St. Mark; W'inchester Cathedral, Bible, vol. III, f. 384v. head which is rather decorative or heraldic in feeling: broad and round or squared in outline, with small erect ears, pro- nounced locks of mane and ruff, and an open grinning mouth, often with teeth prominently displayed. The head is generally shown as frontal or nearly frontal, the nose al- most human in shape with a long, narrow bridge but oddly flattened: one would imagine this head in profile as snub- nosed, like that of a Persian cat. To Pembroke 120 may be added the St. Mark symbols in the Hereford and Trinity College Gospel-Books described above, in Winchester Ca- thedral MS. VIII, and in the Avesnes St. Mark leaf and the destroyed Metz initial. With the exception of the lion-tetra- morph in the Avesnes leaf, and of all but St. Matthew in the Trinity Gospels, these figures have human bodies; all of the human-bodied figures except the Metz St. Mark initial are full-length, and all except the Winchester one are seated frontally or with only slightly turned head, and engaged in writing. (This motif of scribal activity is, of course, supplied by the pendant miniature of the Evangelist himself in the Avesnes-Metz pages). The "English Group B" comprises the tetramorph of St. Matthew in the Doheny Zacharias Chrysopolitanus, the re- lated tetramorph in the Ezekiel initial of the Winchester Bible and the St. Mark symbol in the latter manuscript, as well as the St. Luke tetramorph in Lambeth Palace MS 102. 13</page><page sequence="12">The chief point of contrast between these and the Group A symbols, apart from the obviously stronger Ezekiel con- nection in the first two members of Group B, is the differ- ent form of the lion's head: tending toward the long- snouted, usually in profile, and generally more rodent-like and lacking any abundant ruff or mane. Taken separately or together, none of the main charac- teristics of Group A may be called exclusively English: the frontally-seated, human-bodied Evangelist symbol, whether writing or not, with mask-like grinning "heraldic" face or a more rodent-like or even a more realistically leonine head, may be found in countless Continental manu- scripts and other works of art.63 What appears, rather, to be the specifically English characteristic of the manuscripts under discussion is their close and explicit connection and intermingling with the iconography of the Vision of Ezek- iel.64 English art in the Romanesque period is noted for its frequent and original, even bizarre, iconographic idio- syncrasies.65 To their number we may add the motif of Evangelist-symbol-as-tetramorph, which was apparently employed at one time or another-and surely not by coinci- dence-in several of the major English scriptoria. And the artist of Pembroke 120, in applying to his portrait of St. Mark not only this exotic prophetic reference, but also the singular illustration of his self-amputation, has given us yet another example of true, and typically English, icono- graphic originality. NOTES * This study grew from a short passage in my doctoral dissertation, The Scriptorium of Bur)' St. Edmunds in the Twelfth Century, The Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, 1965, in which I was primarily concerned with indications that the text did not origi- nate at Bury, rather than with the problems the manuscript present- ed in its own right. A much abridged version was presented at the College Art Association meetings of January, 1975 in Washington, D. C. Recent work on this project was in part supported by Faculty Research Grants from Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa., and Rutgers University, for which I here express my gratitude. I wish also to thank for their kind assistance, the Librarians and staffs of Pembroke College, Cambridge; Trinity College, Cambridge; the Cambridge University I ibrary Manuscript Room; Hereford Cathe- dral; Lambeth Palace; the Bodlcian Library; the Palaeography Room of the University of London Library; the Warburg Institute; the Courtauld Institute of Art, and the Marquand Library and the Index of Christian Art in Princeton. I am deeply indebted also to Dr. Rosalie Green of the Princeton Index of Christian Art, Dr. Amy Vandersall of the University of Colorado, and Dr. Jane Hayward of the Cloisters, all of whom read the article in manuscript and made helpful sugges- tions, as well as to Dr. Walter Cahn of Yale University who provided me with a copy of his unpublished paper on St. Albans manuscripts. Shortly after this article went to press there appeared the long- book by C.M. Kauffman. Romanesque Manuscripts 1066-1190 (London and Boston, 1975), vol. Ill of J.J.G. Alexander, ed., A Survey of Manuscripts Illuminated in the British Isles. Many of the works mentioned in this article are discussed by Mr. Kauffman, including Pembroke 120 (cat. no. 35, pp. 31 f., 69, 72, 95, figs. 18, 20, 25, ills. 91-102, the St. Mark initial being ill. 93). No new material is introduced, however, that affects the thesis presented in this article. 1. The inscription, on f. 7, reads as follows: REGINALDUS DE DEN- HAM SACRISTA SANCTI EADMUNDI DEDIT HUNC LIBRUM SANCTO EADMUNDO QUI EUM ALIENAVERIT ANATHEMA SIT. This folio is reproduced in M. R. James, A Descriptive Catalogue of the Manuscripts in the Library of Pembroke College. Cambridge, Cambridge, 1905, facing 124. 2. Ff. 1-6v: 402 x 270 mm.; ff. 7-182v: 410 x 271 mm. 3. See E.

Kauff- mann, "The Bury Bible," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld ln- stitutes, XXIX, 1966, 65 and n.27, on the relationship of text and preface miniatures. 4. For description and discussion of the text contents see James, A Des- criptive Catalogue .. , 125 ff., and H. H. Glunz, History of the Vulgate in England, Cambridge, 1933, 187 f., where the author cites Pembroke 120 for Bury St. Edmunds as a substitute for the missing New Testa- ment from the Bury Bible and also notes the presence of "certain Irish relics" which would help confirm its Insular origin. 5. The colophon reads: NOMEN GUILLELMI CUIUS MANUS HOC SCRIPSIT VOLUMEN IN IIBRO VITE ASSCRIBATUR. 6. See L. V. Delisle, Rouleau Mortuaire du B. Vital, Ahhc de Sazigny, Paris, 1909, 2 f. Unfortunately, no Bury Liher Vitae from this period survives. 7. This is treated in my Ph. D. dissertation, E. Parker, The Scriptorirum of Bury St. Edmunds in the Twuelfth Century, The Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, 1965, 48 ff., 196 ff., 254. Two fairly elab- orate examples of the typical Bury ink-initial style from the first half of the twelfth century are reproduced in E. G. Millar, The Library of A. Chester Beatty: A Descriptive Catalogue of the Western Manu- scripts, London, 1927-39, plates vol. I, pls. LXXIII, LXXIV. One of these is also reproduced as no. 9 on pl. 6 of the exhibition catalog, Illuminated and Calligraphic Manuscripts: An Exhibitioin Held at the Fogg Art Museum and Houghtoin Library, Cambridge, Mass., 1955. Display script of a somewhat simpler but closely related style from the Bury Bible is illustrated in W. Oakesshott, Sigena, London and Greenwich, Conn., 1974, fig. 221. To my knowledge, no other ex- amples of the more elaborate rubricated initials have yet been pub- lished, but I intend to include several from the mid-twelfth century in a forthcoming study on Bury illumination subsequent to Master Hugo and the Bury Bible. 8. Compare, for example, the great Bible from Winchester now in Oxford, Bodleian MS. Auct. E. Infra 1 and 2 (0. Pacht, C.R. Dod- well and F. Wormald, The St. Albans Psalter, London, 1960, pl. 156b and e; T.S.R. Boase, English Romanesque Illumination, Oxford, 1951, 14</page><page sequence="13">pl. 17). The Pembroke 120 heads with their aquiline profiles, receding chins and heavy eyes are closer to the profiles from Winchester, or to those of figures in the St. Albans Psalter style than to the profiles in body-color initials of the Bury Bible. See Kauffmann, "The Bury Bible," pls. 20d, 21, 23c, d, and p. 79. With only one exception, Bodleian MS. Laud Misc. 742, a copy of the Leges Langobardorum, the profile head does not appear in Bury manuscripts in simple colored-ink initials. 9. R.A.B. Mynors, Durham Cathedral Manuscripts to the End of the Twelfth Century, Oxford, 1939, 6 ff. 10. This figure's position is somewhat similar to that of Moses removing his shoes before the Burning Bush in two initials on ff. 32v and 67v of the Walsingham Bible in Dublin, Chester Beatty Collection, Wes- tern MS. 22. See E. G. Millar, The Library of A. Chester Beatty, op. cit., text vol. I, 87 and pls. LXVI a and b. In Pembroke 120, however, the motif is different enough to be void of all narrative content. 11. See C. R. Dodwell, in P.cht, et al., The St. Albans Psalter, 202 f., where they are aptly referred to as "tiger stripes". 12. This is most noticeable in the figure of St. Peter on f.113 (Fig. 5) but does not even there approach the true "nested V fold" which is the real hallmark of the style: cf. W. Koehler, "Byzantine Art in the West," Dunharton Oakr Papers, I, 1940, 63-87, and E. Garrison, Studies in the History of Mediaeval Italian Painting, III, 1957-58, 202 ff. For the style as it appears in the Bury Bible see Kauffmann, "The Bury Bible," 75 ff. 13. See Pach t et al. The St. Albans Psalter, 114, pls. 14-41, et passim. Similar treatment of drapery is found in the drawings on ff. 1-6v of Pembroke 120: see Parker, "A Twelfth-century Cycle", pls. XXXII, XXXVIII, XLII. 14. See, for example, the angel on f.4 of Pembroke 120, or the Father and Son on f.6: Parker, "A Twelfth-century Cycle", pls. XXXVIII, XLIII. In this respect the painted figures of Pembroke 120 differ also from seated figures in the miniatures of the St. Albans Psalter itself, and from most of the seated frontal figures in Pierpont Morgan MS. 736, the Passion and Miracles of St. Edmund, whose miniatures were ex- ecuted at Bury, most probably by a close follower of the "Alexis Mas- ter" of the St. Albans Psalter miniatures. One exception is the St. Edmund of the Apotheosis on f. 22v of the Morgan manuscript, illus- trated in Picht, et al., The St. Alhans Psalter, pl. 139, but the hemline there bears no particular resemblance to those in the Pembroke 120 text initials. 15. This was the view of T.S.R. Boase in English Art, 1100-1216, Oxford, 1953, 112. I have not come across it elsewhere, and there seems now to be general agreement that the text and miniatures were bound together at some date considerably later than the completion of either part: see Kauffmann, "The Bury Bible", 65 ff., n. 27. 16. Compare, for example, ff.llv, 113, 153, 163v, 117 of Pembroke 120 (Figs. 1, 2, 4, 5) and those of the Bury Bible illustrated in Kauffmann, "The Bury Bible", pls. 21 ff. 17. Cf. Picht, et al., The St. Albans Psalter, 168 and pl. 156c. Again, one of the best examples is Bodleian MS. Auct. E. Infra 1 from Winches- ter (see n.8 above). "Octopus-tentacled" leaves occur also in the great Bible in Winchester Cathedral: cf. F. Wormald, The Winchester Psal- ter, London, 1973, pls. 1, 95, 100-104. When such leaves occur at all in the Bury Bible, they tend to be turned inwards so that the project- ing spurred profile is less emphasized: for example, on f.275, illus- trated in Wormald, op. cit., pl. 105 (where it is wrongly identified as f.375), and in Kauffmann, "The Bury Bible", pl. 25d. See also Here- ford Cathedral Library, MS. 0.5.xi, the Sermons of St. John Chrysos- tom; B. M. Lansdowne MS. 383, the Shaftesbury Psalter; and Bodleian MS. Auct. F.vi.5, a Boethius, all from an unknown scriptorium in the West of England. M. A. Farley and F. Wormald, "Three Related Eng- lish Romanesque Manuscripts", Art Bulletin, XXII, 1940, 157-161 and especially Figs. 1,8, 11, 12. 18. C. R. Dodwell, The Great Lambeth Bible, London, 1959, and The Can- terbury School of Illumination, 1066-1200, Cambridge, 1954, 48 ff. For a recent and thorough study of the color of English twelfth- century manuscripts including the Bury and Lambeth Bibles, see H. Roosen-Runge, Farbgebung und Technik Frtihmittelalterlicher Buchmalerei, Munich and Berlin, 1967, vol. I, 79 ff. 19. Compare the school of illumination, located no more precisely than "in the West of England", analyzed by M. A. Farley and F. Wormald in "Three Related English Romanesque Manuscripts". Just as the three manuscripts discussed there, especially B. M. Lansdowne MS. 383, the Shaftesbury Psalter, bear close resemblances to St. Albans manu- scripts but cannot be attributed to that scriptorium, so Pembroke 120 exhibits many similarities both with St. Albans manuscripts and with the Lansdowne 383 group, but belongs to neither school. 20. The question of models or prototypes may also lie behind one other peculiarity of Pembroke 120, brought to my attention by Dr. Rosalie Green of the Index of Christian Art: the location of the historiated initials in Pembroke 120. Why is it that the historiated initials to Matthew and John are placed at the beginning of the Gospel text, while those to Mark and Luke accompany the Argumentum? A deeper investigation of this anomaly may suggest interesting conclusions about prototypes, but cannot be undertaken in this essay. Here let us merely note that in the related Gospel-Books in Hereford, Trinity College, Cambridge, Lambeth Palace and Liessies/Metz, to be dis- cussed below, as well as in the Winchester Bible, the historiated initial is that of the Gospel text itself, not the Prologue, while in Lambeth Palace MS. 102, another related manuscript, the prologue Quoniam Quidem to Luke also has a winged ox, though not a tetramorphic one. Pembroke 120 stands apart from the St. Albans group, however, in having two of its major initials adorning, not the text of the Gospel concerned, but its Argument. 21. For these artists see Picht et al., The St. Albans Psalter, 165 ff; C. R. Dodwell, The Great Lambeth Bible, 16 ff; O. Pacht, "A Cycle of Eng- lish Frescoes in Spain", The Burlington Magazine, CIII, 1961, 166 ff., and, more recently, 0. Demus, Romanesque Mural Painting, New York, 1970, 486 ff., and W. Oakeshott, Sigena, passim. One might also include the artist who worked both at St. Albans and at Winchester: see, most recently, ibid., 83 f. and n. 13. 22.

Swarzenski and R. Schilling, Die Illuminierten Handschriften .. . in Frankfurter Besitz, Frankfurt, 1929, 110 ff., pl. XLVIIIa). There are numerous other examples, particularly in Missals and other books of private devotion of the fourteenth century. The two Sts. John are also included in roundels flanking the Virgin in Tree of Jesse miniatures in manuscripts of the Speculum Virginum: see A. Watson, "The Speculum Virgin with special reference to the Tree of Jesse", Speculum, III, 1928, 458, 461, pl. V (where the figures are not identified). Also M.

They appear, for example, in the early ninth-century Gospels of St. Medard of Soissons (Paris, B. N. MS. lat. 8850), where on f. 81v the Angel of the Lord of Mark 1:2 and John the Baptist are placed in the spandrels over the arch enclosing the Evangelist and his symbol (W. Koehler, Die karolingischen Miniaturen, Atlas, vol. II, op. cit., pl. 83); in Manchester, John Rylands Library MS. 11, a twelfth-century Gospel-Book from Dinant, where the initial I on f. 58 contains a fig- ure of the Baptist holding a medallion with the Lamb of God (M. R. James, A Descriptive Catalogue of the Latin Manuscripts in the John Rylands Library of Manchester, Manchester, 1921, 32 and pl. 31); and in a fourteenth-century Bible from Naples (Vienna, Oesterr. Na- tional-Bibliothek MS. 1191), where on f. 374 Mark, in priestly vest- ments, faces John the Baptist who points to a bust of Christ in the clouds above (F. Wickhoff, ed., Beschreibendes Verzeichnis der il- luminierten Handschriften in Oesterreich, vol. 8, Die illuminierten Handschriften und Inkunabeln der Nationalbibliothek in Wien, 5. Teil, Die italienischen Handschriften des dugento und trecento, Bd. 3, Neapolitanische und Toskanische Handschriften der zweiten Halfte des XIV. Jahrhunderts, 1930, 279, pl. CXV 3). Byzantine ex- amples include f. 64 of the Greek Gospel-Book in Paris, B. N. MS. Grec 74, where the headpiece to Mark's Gospel contains figures of the Evangelist, John the Baptist, Christ and Isaiah (Mark 1:2) in sep- arate roundels (Paris, Bibliothbque Nationale, D6partement des Manu- scrits, Evangiles aux Peintures Byzantines du 11e Siecle, Paris, 1908, pl. 57) and a similar headpiece to Mark in the fourteenth-century Gospel-Book in the British Museum, Add. MS. 29627, f. 88 (B. Filov, Les Miniatures de l'Evangile du Roi Jean Alexandre a Londres, Sophia, 1934, pl. 42). A late eleventh-century Byzantine Psalter and New Testament at Dumbarton Oaks (MS. 3, f. 129v) shows the usual framed portrait of Mark as a frontispiece to his Gospel, and below it in the margin a mutilated figure of John the Baptist, inscribed with his name (S. Der Nersessian, "A Psalter and New Testament Manu- script at Dumbarton Oaks," Dumbarton Oaks Papers, XIX, 1965, 183, fig. 29f). One is reminded by this appearance of St. John the Baptist in the text of Pembroke 120, of the unusual and puzzling prominence given to his story in the prefatory cycle of the same manuscript, where the lower half of f. 5v shows his beheading (Parker, "A Twelfth-century Cycle", 282 f., n. 103, and pl. XLI). I think there is no need, however, to link his appearance in the initial to the Gospel of John with that in the drawings: there is obviously ample independent tradition to support the former. 30. Cf. Jacobus de Voragine, Legenda Aurea, translated by G. Ryan and H. Ripperger, New York, 1941, 326. He dwells on this connection at some length. 31. A not infrequent feature in Romanesque draperies: compare, for exam- ple, the Lambeth Bible (Boase, English Art, pl. 62); or the Berthold Missal, Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, MS. 710, f. 86v (H. Swarzenski, The Berthold Missal and the Scriptorium of Weingarten Abbey, New York, 1943, pl. XIX). And there are many other in- stances, notably the Shaftesbury Psalter, Lansdowne MS. 383 in the British Museum, ff. 12v (reproduced in O. E. Saunders, English Il- lumination, 1928, vol. I, pl. 42b), and 168v (reproduced in E. G. Mil- lar, English Illuminated Manuscripts of the X-XIII Century, Paris and Brussels, 1926, pl. 33d). 32.

The Evangelist is placed in a sort of open-fronted cubicle, like a medi- eval shop, his left hand resting on the counter while he raises the knife with his right. There seems to be some confusion in this manu- script with the legend of St. Mark's miraculous healing of a cobbler's left hand, recounted immediately after the incident of his own self- mutilation in the Golden Legend. Trenkler loc. cit., identifies the fig- ure as St. Mark, and indeed the man in the little booth has the red tunic and green cloak worn by St. Mark throughout the first seven of the twelve scenes, and his features and nimbus are similar to those of the saint in his other appearances. He has laid out his hand on the counter of the "shop", palm up and fingers curled, and is definitely aiming at the extended thumb, while four men approach the door of the shop, outside. 36.

Here the incident is the second of four quatrefoil vignettes set in the highly ornamented margin of the first page of the prologue to St. Mark, the main decoration of which is a large miniature of the Evangelist writing in his study, accompanied by the winged lion. In the vignette in question, St. Mark is shown standing in a garden, his left hand stretched out in front of him and his right hand hold- ing the knife, about to shave off his thumb with a stroke drawn toward his body. The other four vignettes, clockwise from the top right-hand corner, represent the Baptism of St. Mark, St. Mark as Bishop driving out demon, St. Mark as Bishop seated and reading, and St. Mark's execution by strangling. He seems, interestingly enough, still clearly in possession of his left thumb in the last three vignettes. 38. See Ameisenowa, "Animal-headed Gods, Evangelists, Saints and Righteous Men", 21-45, in which the author surveys the origins of this iconography and supplies an ample bibliography for most aspects of the subject. 39.

Jahrhunderts, Miinster, 1912, esp. 231 ff 16</page><page sequence="15">40. In some variants of St. Jerome's prologue to the Pentateuch, for ex- ample, one reads: Mattheus, marcus, lucas et iohannes, quadriga domini et uerum Cherubim, quod interpretatur scientiae multitudo, per totum corpus oculati sunt, scintillae emicant, discurrunt fulgura, pedes habent rectos et in sublime tendentes, terga pennata et ubique uolantia, tenent se mutuo sibique perplexi sunt et quasi rota in rotam uoluuntur et pergunt quocumque eos flatus sancti spiritus duxerit. (De Bruyne, Prefaces de la Bible Latine, 6, 11. 21-25). One might also cite the passage in St. Jerome's prologue to the Gospels which sums up the traditional basis for the specific assignment of each symbol, ibid., 156. And Isidore of Seville, in his prologue to Ezekiel, writes thus: . . . cernit similitudinem gloriae dei et quatuor animalia in simili- tudinemevangeliorumet rotae se inuicem contuentes in typo testa- mentorum. Uidet et aurigam, id est Christum, deorsum igne iudi- cii, sursum electri, id est diuinitas fulgore rutilantem ... (ibid., p. 130). 41. See for example the passage from the commentary of St. Ambrose on Luke's Gospel: Plerique tamen putant ipsum Dominum nostrum in quatuor Evan- gelii libris, quatuor formis animalium figurari, quod idem homo, idem leo, idem vitulus, idem aquila esse, comprobantur. Homo quia natus ex Maria est; leo, quia fortis est; vitulus, quia hostia est; aquila, quia resurrectio est. Atque ita in libris singulis forma ani- malium figuratur, ut unius cujusque libri series propositorum videatur animalium aut naturae, aut virtuti, aut gratiae, aut mir- aculo convenire ... (Migne, P. L. vol. XV, col. 1612); or a similar passage on St. Mark's Gospel, from a commentary on the four Gospels attributed in the Middle Ages to St. Jerome (Migne, P. L. XXX, col. 609-610): . . . Qui primus Alexandriae fuit episcopus; cujus per singula opus fuit scire, et Evangelii in se dicta disponere, et disciplinam in se legis cognoscere, et divinam in carne Domini intelligere naturam. Qui seminat post Matthaeum; qui fremit, ut leo; qui volat, ut aquila; qui dicit, ut homo; qui immolat, ut sacerdos; qui irrigat, ut flumen; qui florescit, ut ager; qui fervet ut vinum; Christus etenim de quo loquitur, homo nascendo, vitulus moriendo, leo surgendo, aquila est ascendendo. Quatuor sunt qualitates, de quibus sancta Evangelia contexuntur: praecepta, mandata, testimonia, exempla... These two passages, incidentally, were excerpted by Zacharias Chrys- opolitanus in his Harmonyof the Gospels, two English versions of which are mentioned in this study (see below, n. 50-52; the passage may be found in Migne, P. L. CLXXXVI, col. 16). We find similar passages also in the Glossa Ordinaria, first in a prologue to Matthew (Migne, P. L. CXIV, col. 64-65): . .. Christus uero quem describunt, homo fuit de virgine natus; vitu- lus in immolatione, leo in ressurectione, aquila in ascensione. Vel in homine humanitas, in vitulo sacerdotium, in leone regnum, in aquila exprimitur Divinitatis sacramentum. and also in the gloss on Apocalypse 4:6 (P. L. CXIV, col. 718-719): Animalia. Haec bene representant Christum, qui natus est, passus, resurgens, ascendens. Fides quoque rationales et mansueti sunt, ut homo. Sine terrore terentes adversa, ut leo; sese mortificantes, ut vitulus; coelestia petentes, ut aquila. 42. Legenda Aurea, 624. 43. Catalogue ... Pembroke College, 124 44. This once formed part of the now-destroyed Gospel-Book, Metz, Bib- liotheque Municipale MS. 1151, dated 1146. See below notes 55, 56; a full discussion is found in Dom J. Leclercq, "Les Manuscrits de l'Abbaye de Liessies", Scriptorium, VI, 1952, 51-62, especially 53f., 57 and pl. 6; see also C.R. Dodwell, The Great Lambeth Bible, where the page is reproduced as pl. 17. A half-length figure of the pointing Ezekiel, black-bearded and wearing a cap, appears in a half-roundel below the Apocalyptic Vision of Christ in Glory surrounded by the four Evan- gelist symbols in the frontispiece to Ezekiel in the Bury Bible, C. C. C. MS. 2, f. 281v (cf. C. M. Kauffmann, "The Bury Bible," pl. 18). 45. Two early examples of the rare combination of tetramorph and Evan- gelist symbol exist, whose disparities attest the independence of their creators of any common tradition or model. An eighth-century Gospel Book in Trier (Domschatz, Cod. 61, f. 5v) is the most exotic: it shows the tetramorph in a full-page miniature with a single human head and torso, and holding in his hands, which are crossed in front of his chest, a dagger and a floreate scepter. Superimposed on the lower part of this human body are the characteristic wings and the clawed and split-hoofed feet of eagle, lion and ox. The names of the four Evangelists are inscribed on the parchment around this bizarre fig- ure (cf. E. H. Zimmermann, Vorkarolingische Miniaturen, Berlin, 1916-1918, text 128, 282, pl. IV-274. For a color reproduction see P. Verzone, From Theodoric to Charlemagne, London, 1968, 206. See also Karl der Grosse, exhibition catalog, Aachen, 1965, 242, cat. no. 401, where it is listed as "Echternach, um 730"). In the slightly later Book of Armagh in Dublin (Trinity College MS. 52, written in A. D. 807 by the scribe Ferdomnagh from the dic- tation of Torbach, Abbot of Armagh), the symbol of each Evangelist is drawn in ink outline in profile to the right, with two wings pro- jecting parallel to his back and two more pointing downward in front of his forelegs. Set into three of the wings are roundels containing the profile heads, all facing to the right, of the other three symbols. (Cf.J. Gwynn, Liber Ardmachanus, Dublin, 1913. The symbol of Mat- thew is found on f. 32v, that of Luke on f. 69, and those of Mark and John on ff. 54v and 91 respectively). 46. In some Byzantine Gospel-Books one finds a similar linking of the Ezekiel-tetramorph with the portrait and symbol of the Evangelist at the beginning of each Gospel, but the three are not combined or in any way confused, as in most of the English examples. See A. van Buren's description of a tenth-century Byzantine Gospel-Book, MS. De Ricci 3 mn the General Theological Seminary Library, New York, in G. Vikan, ed., Illuminated Greek Manuscripts from American Col- lections: An Exhibition in Honor of Kurt Weitzmann, Princeton, 1973, Cat. No. 55, 192-193. I am indebted to Dr. Van Buren for bringing these Byzantine examples to my attention. 47. Bibl. Mun. MS. 482, f. 5v. See L.

His opinion has recently been confirmed by Dr. Walter Cahn, in a paper on St. Albans and the Channel Style in England, presented before the College Art Associa- tion of America in Washington, D.C. on January 29, 1970, and shortly to be published in volume III of the Metropolitan Museum of New York's The Year 1200.

The text is Zacharias Chrysopoli- tanus' commentary on the Latin version by Victor of Capua of Tati- anus' Diatessaron: cf. Migne, P. L. CLXXXVI, col. llff.

Underwood, "The Fountain of Life in Manuscripts of the Gospels," Dumbarton Oaks Papers, V, 1950, 118-131. The idea of a tetramorph as representing the four symbols in unity, as in this manuscript and that in the Doheny Collection (see below and n. 52), seems to be a later addition to the tradition. 51. See Oakeshott, loc. cit., where the two tetramorph-initials are repro- duced side by side; also idem, The Artists of the Winchester Bible, x, 12f., and pls. XXXIV, XXXV, where the attribution to the "Master of the Morgan Leaf" was first made and Neuss, Das Buch Ezechiel, 233-34 and pl. XIV. The most significant difference lies in the type of animal-heads, robe on the man in Winchester VIII, and the lack of eyes on his wings. These differences of course make the Winchester VIII tetramorph more of a purely composite Evangelist symbol and weaken its connection with the Ezekiel-tetramorph tradition. 52.

The frequent special significance of the scroll when held by the eagle alone, as reflecting the prophetic aspect of St. John has been discussed by Meyer Schapiro in his essay, "Two Romanesque Drawings in Aux- erre and some Iconographic Problems" in D. Miner, ed., Studies in Art and Literature for Belle da Costa Greene, Princeton, 1954, 331 ff. The other explicit links between the Evangelists, their symbols, and the prophets in the Avesnes/Metz illuminations suggest the possibili- ty of a parallel reference here. 58. The motif of the delicate crown appears earlier at St. Albans and at Bury St. Edmunds. See Pacht et al., The St. Albans Psalter, pls. 15b, 17a, 19a, 22a (the St. Albans Psalter) and pl. 139 (Morgan MS 736). 59.

As noted there, the frontispiece to Matthew is missing and that to Luke was apparently never executed, while the figure of St. John, without special attributes, is contained in the initial I to his Gospel. St. Mark is thus the only, or only surviving, exotic treatment of an Evangelist symbol in this manuscript. 62. Winchester Cathedral Library, Bible, vol. IV, ff. 387v and 404 respec- tively. 63. The "heraldic", frontal lion's head may be found, for example, in the Carolingian Gospel-Book in London, B. M. Harley MS.2788, f. 71v (W. Koehler, Die karolingischen Minaturen, Atlas vol. II, pl. 56); in the tenth-century Gospel-Book from Marchiennes, now Morgan MS. 319 in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York (f. 51v; Prince- ton Index photograph); and in the eleventh-century Lectionary of Uta in the Munich Staatsbibliothek, Clm. 13601, f. 41v (G. Swarzen- ski, Die Regensburger Buchmalerei des X. and XI. Jahrhunderts, Leipzig, 1901, pi. XV. 34). The heraldic lion occurs also in the Persian Diatessaron, Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Orient. 81, f. 128 (C. Norden- falk, "An Illustrated Diatessaron", Figs. 14 and 22b and, more recently, idem, "The Diatessaron Miniatures Once More", Art Bulletin, LV, 1973, fig. 3). These two articles, as well as that on "The Miniatures of the Florence Diatessaron" by Meyer Schapiro and Seminar, also in the Art Bulletin, LV, 1973, 494-531, offer several early examples of both types of lion's head. The lion with profile head would seem to have been favoured, though not exclusively so, by early Celtic illuminators: it appears on f. 75v of the Echternach Gospels, MS. lat. 9389 in the Bibliothbque Nationale in Paris (E. H. Zimmermann, Vorkarolingische Miniaturen, Atlas vol. IV, pl. 256a); on f. 191v of the Book of Durrow, Trinity Col- lege, Dublin, MS. 57 (ibid., Atlas vol. III, pl. 161b); on the single- headed lion of f. 32v of the Book of Armagh, Dublin, Trinity College, MS. 52 (J. Gwynn, Liber Ardmachanus, pl. 246a), on p. 142 of the Gospels of St. Chad in Lichfield Cathedral (Zimmermann, Vorkaro- lingische Miniaturen, Atlas vol. III, pl. 246a, as well as frequently in the Book of Kells, Trinity College, Dublin, MS. 58 (ibid., Atlas vol. III, pls. 166, 167, 174, 175, 176, 180). Later, it occurs in the eleventh-century English Gospel-Book, Mor- gan MS. 708 in New York, f. 26v (The Pierpont Morgan Library, Exhibition of Illuminated Manuscripts Held at the New' York Public Library, New York, 1934, pl. 19), and in the early eleventh-century Grimbald Gospels from Winchester, London, B. M. Add. MS. 34890, f. 73v, where a horn issues from his mouth (Rickert, Painting in Bri- tain, pl. 36a). A sort of composite of the two views appears in the St. Mark miniature on f. 93v of the Lindisfarne Gospels, London, B. M. Cotton MS Nero D. IV, also with the horn in its mouth (Zimmer- mann, Vorkarolingische Miniaturen, Atlas vol. III, pl. 224). Later ex- amples of the profile lion-head are also frequent: see, for example, one at Durham, Cathedral Library MS. A. IV. 10, f.l, from the twelfth century (R. A. B. Mynors, Durham Cathedral Manuscripts, 87 and pl. 56). 64. Of the specific combination of tetramorph and Evangelist symbol used in a Gospel context that is under discussion, only that in Troyes MS. 482 (see above n. 47) is not of definite British origin. One should perhaps, however, note also one continental variant of the type, ap- parently a local creation of considerable vitality and originality, but of limited spread, to be found in two twelfth-century German Bibles. In the Gumpert Bible, Erlangen, Universitiats-Bibliothek Cod. 121, each of the four Gospels is introduced by an initial with the Evangelist symbol shown as a cherub, with four wings and standing on a wheel. He holds in each case a penknife and inkhorn, and tilts his head back to catch water poured from an urn by a youth perched above him, symbolizing one of the four Rivers of Paradise (G. Swarzenski, Die Salzburger Malerei von den ersten Anfangan bis zur Blitezeit des romanischen Stils, Leipzig, 1908-13, 129-142 and pi. XLVIIl, Abb. 147 and pi. XLVIII, Abb. 148). A second twelfth-century Bible, Cod. 1 and 2 in the Stiftsbibliothek at Admont, has similar Evangelist symbols (ibid., 72 ff.). These Bibles thus combine elements of the Living Creatures of Ezekiel and the Evangelist symbol proper, but in a quite different manner from the English examples, although the Admont Bible's miniature to Ezekiel (ibid., 75 and pl. XXVIII, Abb. 96) does include a tetramorph which is compared by Swarzenski tc that of the Winchester Bible. 65. For example, the early twelfth-century miniatures in Morgan MS. 777 showing the Evangelists seated upon their symbols (D. Tselos, "Unique Evangelist Portraits in an English Gospel-Book of the Twelfth Century", Art Bulletin, XXXIV, 1952, 252-77) or that of St. Luke sacrificing his bull in the Dover Bible, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS. 4, f.191v (Dodwell, The Canterbury School, 87 f. and pl. 58a, and Swarzenski, Monuments of Romanesque Art, 60 and Fig. 284). One might also cite such significant innovations as the introduction of the prophetic Chalice into the scene of the Agony in the Garden in the St. Albans Psalter (Picht et al., The St. Albans Psalter, 61 f., 89, 160, 242 and pls. 25b, 70d [Psalm 101, Alb. Ps. p. 2701.
