Stud. 24, pp. 337-364 HYWEL THOMAS GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS AND JOHN DUNS SCOTUS The lord whose is the oracle at Delphoi neither utters nor conceals his meaning, but reveals it with a sign. (Heracleitos fragment) In the eternal truth from which all temporal things are made, we behold the form... and we have within us like a word the knowledge of what we have conceived. (St Augustine, De Trin.) For the invisible things of Him, since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood through the things that are made. (St Paul, Romans i. 20) PREAMBLE It may be that poetry and its production, along with persons, their pro? creation and all else that is holy, stand, absolutely, in no need of a philo? sophical foundation, in no need of an intellectual raison d'?tre. There is nevertheless a sort of faltering, or better, a sort of stammer, of the spirit which infects us all to some degree or other; an evaporation of faith, a sudden inversion of consciousness (the 'unbelief perhaps, of Augustine), where what could and should have been natural and spontaneous becomes a matter of strenuous intellectual effort. Faith in that which is over and against us succumbs to the neurotic urge to believe things about it. Its contemplation perversely becomes the strained attempt to render it philo? sophically comprehensible. And its celebration is postponed indefinitely, in want of a rational justification. The word 'behold' seems to have dis? appeared from our vocabulary. The 'stammer' is there in Hopkins too. In spite of the ecstatic celebratory nature of the best of his poetry, there is discernible in his journals, his letters, his undergraduate essays and lecture notes, clear evidence of that faltering, that intellectual spirit. Poetry did not, for him, supply its own vindication. This could only come from outside, as it were, with the provision of a philosophically coherent account both of what it is, and what its making. Between 1866-the year of his reception into the Roman Catholic Church - and 1868 when he entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus, the twin strands of his earlier philological and aesthetic theorizings had merged into a single and explicitly epistemological whole. The point of their con? fluence is a notebook headed 'Notes on the History of Greek Philosophy',</page><page sequence="2">338 HYWEL THOMAS two significant extracts from which (one on 'Meaning' and the other an interpretation of Parmenides) appear in the published Journals and Papers of G.M.H. It is here incidentally, that Hopkins' notoriously difficult 'technical terminology', 'inscape', 'instress', 'foredrawing' and even 'inlaw' occur for the first time. The general account of the nature of language, thought and Being, and the position ascribed within it to prosody, which emerges from these extracts, is of considerable philosophical interest in itself, and will be my first concern. But for Hopkins meanwhile, the 'stammer' grew into silence. The account which he had formulated of the poetic act was such as to render it unjusti? fiable on religious grounds, in a manner to some degree reminiscent of Plato's strictures upon the poetic art. It is for this reason, I believe and not merely as an act of devotion, of ascetic self-abnegation that on his entry into the priesthood he decided to renounce poetry as ' not belonging to his profession ', and on an occasion cross-referenced in his journal and significantly desig? nated 'the massacre of the innocents', destroyed his extant work. The philosophical rationalization was insufficient in that poetry, its beauty, its creation, appeared still to remain four square in the sphere of the profane. During the next six years he became acquainted with the writings of the medieval philosopher and theologian John Duns Scotus and here at last, in and through his understanding of the 'subtle Doctor's' theological and metaphysical writings, particularly I believe, those concerned with the possi? bility of man's natural knowledge of God Cognitio Naturalis de Deo, (Opus Oxoniense I) is the philosophical foundation completed; his poetic vocation vindicated, his craft sanctified. Within a new context, poetry could be reconstrued as prayer; its creation as more properly pro-creation, and its reception - communion. The silence was over. In what follows, my first concern will be entirely with the ' stammer ' ; with Hopkins' long and painful struggle to understand the nature of poetry - in short, with its philosophical foundation. Here perhaps I should try to make clear just what I understand by this. In so far as the philosopher renders anything intelligible at all, he does so in a manner entirely different from that of the scientist. That is, he does not provide explanations of the occurrence of phenomena. Causes, whether physical or psychological are not his concern. Rather, he re-interprets phenomena; identifies or distinguishes between them with regard to their meaning or significance. The process, viewed formally, resembles what goes on, for instance, in interpreting one person's behaviour to another; in casting it in a new light, perhaps by exhibiting an apparently bizarre action as more familiar behaviour. To construct a philosophical foundation then, is to provide a phenomenon with a context of significance ; to relate it to other phenomena in terms of their being alternative modes of expression of one</page><page sequence="3">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 339 and the same thing; to represent two things differently structured, as instances of the same form. Philosophical analysis, whenever it succeeds in being anything other than a banal exercise, is the formulation of disinctions on this level. One more point with regard to the relationship between the provision of a philosophical foundation in this sense, and the business of justification. When the phenomenon which I define is an action of my own, then the processes are virtually indistinguishable ; think, for instance, of the use of expressions like 'What I really meant was... '. When, however, as it is with us now, we examine the process as it goes on in another, objectively, as it were, the notions are completely distinct. That we understand what poetry was for Hopkins, no more commits us to an aesthetic judgement than does an analyst's unearthing of the 'real' significance of his patient's behaviour imply his approval of it. All that matters, to the philosopher at least, is that one more answer to the question 'What is poetry?' has been exhibited as a coherent possibility; or to express the same thing in terms now somewhat pass? : that a further mode of its being has been defined. As T. H. White says somewhere: 'The philosopher's job is to make ideas available.' The six-year hiatus in Hopkins' work provides as natural a division as any of the discussion which follows. I shall first be concerned with the synthesis as it stood immediately prior to his acquaintance with Scotus, and shall try to show in what way his philological and epistemological theories as well as his aesthetics converge, as it were, on one conclusion. In the second section I shall discuss the manner in which Scotism might have enabled him to reconcile his poetic and priestly vocations. i Hopkins' early undergraduate diary (see The Journals and Papers of G.M.H., Ed. House &amp; Storey) and his lifelong correspondence with A. W. M. Baillie (a close undergraduate friend, brilliant scholar and later amateur Egypto? logist) clearly evidence his enduring passion for philology. The diary is crammed with jottings and memos, mostly etymological, many of which apparently render intelligible much of his subsequent deliberate poetic use of archaisms and bizarre metaphor. But it would, I think, be a mistake to regard its function as merely that of experimenting with the poet's palette, since his papers contain further evidence of his having seriously studied the work of professional comparative philologists. I might mention in particular Max M?ller - then Taylorian Professor of Modern European Languages at Oxford - with whom, incidentally, his father had also corresponded. The etymological derivations which he offers are, in the light of modern know? ledge, as often ingeniously wrong as they are correct; or so, at least, the pundits tell us. Their truth, however, is not as relevant here as is an analysis</page><page sequence="4">340 HYWEL THOMAS of Hopkins' etymological method and its general signification. In attempting the latter, perhaps I might be permitted to quote at length two extracts from the early diary and then proceed to comment on them. (i) Horn The various lights under which a horn may be looked at have given rise to a vast number of words in language. It may be regarded as a projection, a climax, a badge of strength, power or vigour, a tapering body, a spiral, a wavy object, a bow, a vessel to hold withal or to drink from, a smooth hard material not brittle, stony metallic or wooden, something sprouting up, something to thrust or push with, a sign of honour or pride, an instrument of music, etc. From the shape, kernel and granum, grain, corn. From the curve of a horn, KORONIS, corena, crown. From the spiral crinis, meaning ringlets, locks. From it being the highest point comes our crown perhaps, in the sense of the top of the head, and the Greek KERAS, horn, and KARA, head, were evidently identical ; then for its sprouting up and growing, compare here - cornu, KERAS, horn with grow, cresco, grandis, grass, great, groot. For its curving curvus is probably from the root horn in one of its forms. KORONE in Greek and corvus, comix in Latin and crow (perhaps also raven, which may have been craven originally) in English bear a striking resemblance to cornu, curvus. So also GERANOS, crane, heron, heme. Why these birds should derive their name from horn I cannot presume to say. The tree cornel, Latin cornus is said to derive its name from the hard horn-like nature of its wood, and the corns of the foot perhaps for the same reason. Corner is so called from its shape, indeed the Latin is cornu. Possibly (though this is rather ingenious than likely, I think) grin may mean to curve up the ends of the mouth like horns. Mountains are called horn in Switzerland; now we know from Servius that herna meant saxum whence the Hernici, Rock-men, derive their name; herna is a horn-like crag. ERNOS, a shoot, is so-called from its horn-like growth. Curiously enough the expression KERAON ERNOS occurs in Oppian, and another word, ERNUX in the Poetics of Aristotle. Or it is possible that ERNOS may be called from its shooting up as, not in the shape of, a horn. Expression. He hath raised up a horn of salvation for us. (2) See horn above. On the other hand the derivation o? granum, grain may be referred to the head: Grind, gride, gird, grit, groat, grate, greet, KROUEIN, crush, crash, KROTEIN, etc. Original meaning to strike, rub, particularly together. That which is produced by such means is the grit, the groats or crumbs like fragmentum from frangere, bit from bite. Crumb, crumble perhaps akin. To greet, to strike the hands together (?). Greet, grief, wearing, tribulation. Grief possibly connected. Gruff, with a sound as of two things rubbing together. I believe these words to be onomatopoeic. Gr. common to them all representing a particular sound. In fact, I think the onomatopoeic theory has not had a fair chance. Cf. Crack, creak, croak, crake, graculus, crackle. These must be onomatopoeic. Etymology is of course concerned with establishing the verbal ancestry of words and linguistic expressions ; with tracing back the genealogy of a word or perhaps a variety of words to one authentic root-itself a word. Words, in addition to being complex reproducible sound patterns, or written codi? fications of these, are also of course, signs. That is, they stand in relation not only to other words, but also to that which is not a word. The last</page><page sequence="5">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 341 sentence might appear to be labouring the obvious until one realises that its implication is that two possible modes of connection may be set up between words, both etymologically relevant. Let us call these modes the phonetic and the semantic. One word can give rise to another word for the same thing purely qua sound pattern; i.e. their connection is phonetic. Consider, for instance, the derivation of'crayfish' from 'Ecrivisse', or the designation of a species of rose, 'Quarter sessions rose' from 'Rose de Quatre Saisons'. (This last example is drawn from a delightful little book, stronger perhaps in anecdote and arresting illustration than in cogent argumentation - An Essay on the Origin of Language by F. W. Farrer - which it appears, Hopkins probably read, though specific reference to it is absent.) Suppose, however, that two words for two different things are clearly seen to resemble each other phonetically ; the derivation of one from the other according to the dynamic principles of phonology remains vacuous, i.e. does not amount to the establishing of a genuine genealogical connection unless, moving on to the semantic plane, it is possible to reconstruct imaginatively an analogous relation between the actual things or conceptions signified. See for example the manner in which Hopkins in several letters to Baillie of 1886 discusses the derivation of the Greek name HEPHAESTOS from the Egyptian PHTAH. Clearly, this of necessity involves discussion and com? parison of the nature of the deities concerned ; involves an excursion into comparative mythology and cultural history. Hopkins' preoccupation with exploring the underlying semantic connec? tions which, in his view, were represented by the otherwise accidental pho? netic resemblances, was certainly at odds with the rather more positivist methods of the professional etymologists of his day. It is indeed to conceive etymology in a manner reminiscent of Stoic logic, in which 'TO ETYMON ' signified the formal nature of the thing designated and not merely a verbal root. The first extract illustrates this perfectly. The authentic root, the ultimate bearer of significance, is not the Greek word keras, but horn itself! It is this material complex structure of perceptual properties or a concrete situation in which horn occurs, that is the real sign, and its signification is all that, whose structure is analogous, i.e. quite literally all that is perceived to have the same form. The phonetic resemblances are secondary expressions of this, mere epiphenomena of significance. For Hopkins, the thing or situation itself is significant, and awareness of its signification is the perception of all that is structurally analogous to it. Things in so far as they are present to consciousness as complex, as structured, are meanings, or potentially so. The second extract raises the more general philological question of the origin of language and expresses the attraction which Hopkins felt towards 14 RES 24</page><page sequence="6">342 HYWEL THOMAS the ' Onomatopoeic ' theory, or the ' Bow-wow ' theory of language as it was disparagingly called even then. That many words are onomatopoeic is, of course, beyond dispute, but in so far as language is regarded as essentially onomatopoeic, then what is being urged is that not only are the intra linguistic relations between words and their roots phonetic, but that the ultimate semantic relation of designation between verbal root and thing (the bridge, or point of connection between language and the world) is so too. As it stands, the theory is absurd, and indeed historically has appeared in the most ludicrously bizarre forms. I cannot resist mentioning in this context the theory of a nineteenth-century Dr Murray who succeeded - to his own satisfaction at least - in deriving all Indo-European languages from the nine onomatopoeic vocables 'Ag', 'Bag', 'Dwag', 'Cwag', 'Lag', 'Mag', 'Nag', 'Rag', 'Swag'! (See Farrer again.) Clearly, the semantic relation between say ' growl ' and what it designates is of a different order from that between 'cow' and what it designates, and that, in spite of their both being onomato? poeic words. I believe, however, that if one subjects what is involved here to logico semantic scrutiny then the theory appears much nearer the mark than might have seemed at first sight. Indeed, onomatopoeia presents itself as merely one more concrete form or aspect of what might well be the single logical feature essential to anything whatever that purports to be language. Mor? eover, that Hopkins recognized this albeit in an imprecise and intuitive manner, emerges, I think, from the 'Notes on Parmenides' mentioned above. The word 'Onomatopoeia' means literally 'name-making'. It has come to represent, however, a particular form of designating; namely that of reproducing phonetically, or producing a phonetic approximation to that which it directly designates. As a theory of the nature of language it argues that verbal roots (ultimately names) phonetically reproduce their designata and that it is at this point and in this manner that language 'meshes', as it were, with the world. (As an interesting example of the kind of corroborative instance that might be cited, take the Hebrew verb 'to be', which might plausibly be regarded as designating Being, through phonetically repro? ducing the sound of breathing. Incidentally, it is never used in the present tense maybe because it also figures as the verbal root of the name of God-'Jahveh'.) The absurdity of the theory would appear, however, in its apparent claim that all names are onomatopoeic or are reducible to vocables which are. What, one might ask, is one to make of ' Richard Mulhouse Nixon ' ! Surely, whatever sound one uses as a designation is originally an arbitrary matter and thenceforth, conventional. There cannot possibly be an essential or even natural connection between 'Nixon' and the man. He is in way reproduced or reproducible in sound !</page><page sequence="7">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 343 There lies concealed here, however, an assumption (shared it is true, both by proponents of the onomatopoeic theory as well as by its critics) which is fallacious, though it remains unquestioned even in most contem? porary linguistic and psycho-linguistic theory. This is that naming is the ultimate semantic relation; prior both logically and in the temporal sense, to the emergence of descriptive sentences or propositions : That language is ultimately reducible on analysis to names whether of things, attributes, classes or relations; is constructed from them, and in time emerges from them much as it is imagined a child first learns the names of things and then slowly, over a period of time, learns to string them together in propositions of increasing complexity. For some time now, nevertheless, logicians (post-Frege) have accepted that it is only in the context of a proposition (i.e. the representation of a situation or state of affairs) that a name succeeds in acquiring a reference ; that is, that an arbitrary sound becomes, or can be construed as a name. The representation to oneself of an intelligibly structured situation is prior both logically and in time to the emergence of sound as a name. Rather than enter any further into the logical complexities of the argument perhaps an illustration or two of what is implied might suffice. Consider the familiar business of teaching a child the meaning of the word 'ta' (thank you). What in fact happens is that the sound (one of the earliest reproducible with ease by a child) is first experienced as merely one com? ponent (a sonic component, but a component none the less) of a complex structure, the whole giving/receiving situation including both the gesture and facial expression. It is this whole situation which is reproduced by the child, and the sound 'ta' (if what one is teaching is 'manners' and not just language) is experienced and reproduced as an indispensible component of it. Thereafter the reproduction of the whole structure occurs in such a way that it (not just the sound) comes ambiguously to mean 'Give me...', 'Take this' or 'I want'. Gradually the context in which the reproduction of this pattern is deemed appropriate is refined, and the emergence of the sound as word and the child as polite, coincide. Although 'ta' is not a name, I think that on reflection, the process of acquiring early designatory expressions, will be seen to be essentially the same. The implication of this is that once one discards the assumption of the semantic priority of naming, then that which is formally essential to the onomatopoeic relation, i.e. that it reproduces its meaning appears to be no less essential to the process of acquiring language, or the setting up of semantic connection between sounds and things. A further implication is that whatever is reproducible* (its being meant) is the production of a struc? tural analogue. There then seems to be no reason whatever why an ordered phonetic sequence (sounds or written marks are, after all no less physical entities than are trees, tables and chairs) should not provide such an 14-2</page><page sequence="8">344 HYWEL THOMAS analogue in what is essentially the same manner as a horn may represent a mountain or an erect penis (Hopkins seems inexplicably to have missed this further example!). Proper names, with regard to the manner in which they acquire significance, are no exception. They too start as things, as sonic indices of their bearers which operate in essentially the same way as would a numbered disc strung about the neck. That is, a proper name is ultimately no more than a sound tag which was once ritually attached to its bearer, and then subsequently succeeds in designating it via the description 'That to which the sound "X" was ritually attached on such and such an occasion' whether it be christening, launching or whatever, i.e. via a complex situation of which it was a component. The point of most general philosophical significance which emerges from all this is twofold. The distinction between world and language, between thing and word, nature and artifice, is dissolved. First of all in its material aspect ; language qua sounds, marks, etc. is in no way different from - indeed is literally part of our physical, sensible environment. Secondly, possession of significance, something's meaning something to us and consequently our being able to mean something by it, is constituted by the same internal relation, whether between things and things, words and words, or words and things, i.e. by the presence to consciousness of structured wholes (Gestalten) and our awareness of their structural analogues. Communication presupposes significance, and the latter is already there in the world as presented to consciousness. 'In the beginning was the LOGOS.' This is essentially the manner in which Hopkins, with obvious approval, interprets Parmenides' (see extract noted above). And it is here in an explicitly epistemological context that his novel terminology first occurs. Parmenides' concern was with 'Being', and his somewhat obscure con? clusion with regard to it was that it is One. 'Being' here, of course, does not mean 'that which is', the existent, but rather, in grammatical terms, is the participle used substantially. Think, for instance, how as children we wondered what it was to be something or someone else; clearly a different question from 'What are others like?'. Here we were asking not what such and such, but rather, what being such and such, is. 'Being' in this sense then, both for Parmenides and Hopkins, is being a unity, a whole of parts. All that is, in so far as it is knowable, is a cohesive, structured unit, 'foredrawn' as it were, in perspective, to the mind. Its characteristic structure, its essence, its being that which it is, is its 'inscape'. And that tension, that equilibrium, that dynamic holding together of its parts in one whole, is its 'instress'. Perhaps at this stage an illustration followed by some corroborative quotes from the Parmenides extract might lighten the 'metaphysical murk'. Suppose one were to ask what constituted something's being for one a piece of music as opposed to an arbitrary sequence of sounds, however accurately registered by the ear, then I believe the logically constitutive</page><page sequence="9">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 345 conditions would emerge as follows. First of all, the sequence would have to be experienced by one from, as it were, a vantage point or perspective as 'framed off' from preceding and subsequent sounds, as 'fore-drawn'. Secondly, this detachment from its aural context, in the absence of anything analogous to a 'frame', could only be constituted by its being experienced as possessing an internally autonomous structure, a self-contained network of aural cross-references and allusions, its ' inscape ' adumbrated through the dimension of time. Finally it is listened to, not merely heard; just as a poem is read not seen, or a painting is scanned. The attention is caught up and carried into the structure, and in following it through, duplicates within itself the structural tension of the whole; its 'instress' is stressed. I should add that these features are understood by Hopkins as forming the grounds of the possibility not merely of aesthetic experience but of all awareness whatever, and are present in even the simplest act of cognition (see quotation (2) below). Now perhaps Hopkins can speak for himself: ( 1 ) Parmenides' great text, which he repeats with religious conviction, is that Being is and Not-being is not - which perhaps one can say... means that all things are upheld by instress and are meaningless without it. (2) But indeed I have often felt when I have been in this mood and felt the depth of an instress or how fast the inscape holds a thing that nothing is so pregnant and straightforward to the truth as simple 'yes' and 'is'. 'Thou couldst never either know or say what was not, there would be no coming at it.' There would be no bridge, no stem or stress between us and things to bear us out and carry the mind over: without stress we might not and could not say 'Blood is red' but only 'This blood is red' or 'The last blood I saw'was red' nor even that, for not only would universals not be true, but the copula would break down even in particular judgements. (3) Not-being is here seen as want of oneness, all that is unforedrawn, waste space which offers either nothing to the eye to foredraw or many things foredrawing away from another. To be and to know or Being and thought are the same. The truth in thought is Being, stress, and each word is one way of acknowledging Being and each sentence by its copula is (or its equivalent) the utterance and assertion of it. The last quotation underlines what I hope will already have become clear with regard to Hopkins' view of language's role in the epistemological nexus. Since Being and thought are one and the same, i.e. the being of something is its ' inscapedness ' and awareness of it is the instressing of its inscape upon consciousness; language is the further 'uttering' of it, its formal duplication. The word which Hopkins chooses later on in the same extract to designate this operation is a deliberate archaism. He speaks of putting a thought or thing. Much earlier in his diary he notes that 'to put' originally means 'to set up', 'to represent' (compare the role of the German equivalent 'Stellen' in those philosophically 'loaded' expressions 'Darstellen'-'to enact, to perform', or 'Vorstellung' - an image, an idea). That is, language reproduces analogically the structure of its signification, concretely partakes</page><page sequence="10">346 HYWEL THOMAS of its form. The crucial importance of this insight in his aesthetic theory and in his later religious misgivings I shall now try to sketch. The most immediately striking feature of Hopkins' later journals is the amount of space lovingly devoted to descriptions of nature. Entry after entry is given over to the most carefully observed and minutely drawn word portraits of natural phenomena. They bear in many ways a striking resem? blance to the Notebooks of Leonardo, exhibiting the same obsession with getting at the underlying structure of the phenomenon whether it be an eddy of water or a cloud formation. And much as Leonardo's motives were ultimately concerned with the business of mechanically reproducing these dynamic forms, Hopkins is concerned with drawing from them inspiration for the creation of equivalent harmonies and counterpoints in art. Already in his early undergraduate essay 'A Platonic Dialogue on the Origin of Beauty' the thought that beauty or Aesthetic value resides ultimately in the structural features of a work of art, was already well developed though not as yet exhibited as a corollary of his philological and epistemological theory. One further point of cardinal importance had however been stressed. Fore? shadowing the dissolution of the 'language/world' distinction, the 'artefact/ nature' distinction had already disappeared, at least in terms of Aesthetics. That is, Hopkins had realized, as did later aesthetes (Whistler, Wilde) that no account of Beauty was viable which ignored the manifest fact that the aesthetic response is evoked as much by nature as by art. If in both cases this had ultimately to do with one's response to form or structure, then realist art could be nothing more than parasitic upon nature for its aesthetic content, a mere documenting of its forms; and the artist consequently a mere craftsman, valued for the skill exercised in its execution. But equally implicit in the structuralist theory was the possibility of the construction or invention of new forms or patterns. Here, and here alone would the artist achieve a genuinely creative role, with the result that his work would now no longer lovingly delineate the forms of nature but would constitute an autonomous addition to them, would stand alongside them as a rival. (It is in this context I believe, that Wilde's later aesthetic excesses are to be understood - 'my life is my art', etc. Also, the development of Whistler's work from early realism to paintings whose descriptive content (in spite of their being far from abstract in the contemporary sense) becomes insig? nificant, and which are given titles such as 'Symphony in White'. Inci? dentally, even his famous portrait of his mother was originally designated by him 'Arrangement in Black and Gray No. 1 '!) It would be a mistake nevertheless to think that in Hopkins' case (maybe in Whistler's too) what we have is one more working over the familiar form versus content argument; 'metre versus meaning' or 'sound versus sense'. It is saved from this precisely because his aesthetic theory is finally epistemo logically grounded. For him such distinctions must ultimately be vacuous</page><page sequence="11">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 347 since meaning or sense too, even in the most proaeic, the simplest act of cognition, is a matter of awareness of structure and formal analogy. Form and its instressing are all there is ! Poetry, indeed, art in general, could not then be regarded as an extravagant excursion from the prosaic to the meta? phorical, occasionally permitted 'on licence' as it were. ('Language itself is a dictionary of faded metaphors', Jean Paul Richter.) Rather, it was a return to the source both of being and thought; the rediscovery of that ' dearest freshness deep down things ' by concretely realizing it anew in novel verbal or plastic forms. In spite of his predilection for nature-study, he is not a nature poet since its forms are not so much documented as analogically developed, and in spite of the occasionally bizarre and overwrought nature of his verse, he is far from the arrogant egocentric posturing of the aesthete. Music, as the most formal of the arts, once more provides the best illus? tration of the kind of process referred to above as ' the analogical development of natural forms'. Now music is all structure; even the awareness of two notes of different pitch is essentially the awareness of their structural relation within the aural gamut. Yet music succeeds in being sad, happy, noble, whimsical ; succeeds even in evoking a place, and that, without recourse to extra musical associations or allusion to folk-tunes or whatever. (Think of how the music of Sibelius is somehow at one with the Finnish landscape.) But how is this accomplished? How is an emotion or even a moral disposition contained in something so formal? How does the 'feel' of a place enter into its music? To say that the emotion is in us rather than in the music is utterly inadequate, since one is perfectly capable of recognizing its nobility, its whimsicality, without in the least feeling noble or whimsical, not to speak of Finnish! What then does one recognize? Hopkins' answer would be simply ' Sadness, Nobility, Whimsy, Finland ' and this by reconstituting within oneself by attentively entering into the structure of the work, not them but their forms, their characteristic structures. Instress in its aesthetic employment is not really a psychological concept at all, and certainly denotes nothing of the order of an emotion or sensation ; as though to be aware of the 'instress of Wales' (Hopkins' own use of the notion) were literally to feel Welsh ! Rather, in the work of art, it is the instress itself, that compelling dynamic tension that upholds and unifies the inscape, that reconstitutes itself in an analogous form, and there remains as an object of contemplation. After all, that sadness or nobility should have a characteristic structure which is representable in visual or aural forms is not really any more surprising (for a philosopher at least) than that top C is visually representable on an oscillograph, or as a sand pattern on a sym? pathetically vibrating disc. Can I not here still be said to be contemplating the structure of top C in its visual hypostatization ? Consider in this context that arresting line of Wilfred Owen's: 'My subject is war, and the pity of war. The poetry is in the pity, ' i.e. aesthetic value</page><page sequence="12">348 HYWEL THOMAS is already there in the structure of pity itself and is in no way an additional product of its expression in verse. There are still two question, however, which remain unanswered. First of all, poetry, it might be argued, is in an important sense less formal than music in so far as it makes use of verbal material used elsewhere in ordinary discourse for ends other than aesthetic. Is the level then on which its signi? ficant structure lies, purely that of the formal arrangement of this material in terms of syllable length and metre or maybe additionally in terms of assonances, rhyme, alliteration, etc. ? Is the formalist obsession finally con? summated in poetry such as the early experimental work, say, of Edith Sitwell? The answer briefly is 'NO', since for Hopkins at least, that which is referred to as 'material' formally to be arranged, is itself, as we have seen, no less formal a structure that its arrangement. The musical analogy remains a fruitful one. A musical theme is no less formal a structure than a sonata in which it might occur. Furthermore any piece of music whatever, is already constituted as an internal contrapuntal tension between structures simult? aneously existing on a variety of levels ; linear melodic structures, vertical harmonic structures, rhythmic and tonal structures; in effect already pre? sents a prodigiously complex inscape long before one gratuitously introduces, from outside as it were, the notion of'Sonata', 'Rondo', or 'Symphonic' form, etc. Similarly in prosody the notion of form or structure is not restricted by Hopkins to the conventional extrinsic level of'Sonnet', Ballad', etc., nor even to metrical, alliterative, or rhythmic patterns, but is extended to cover syntactic and even semantic patterns. Anything which clearly exhibits form or inscape and its development on any or all of these levels, is essentially poetic. As an example of structure on a purely syntactic and semantic level, take the first verse of the first Psalm, here set out as it stands in the original Hebrew. (Hopkins in his lecture notes, 'Rhythm and Other Structural Parts of Rhetoric' is aware of the fact that Hebrew poetry 'is of this nature, that is, figure of grammar instead o? figure of spoken sound'. Blessed is the man That walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly. That standeth not in That sitteth not in the seat the way of sinners. of the scornful. Here not only is the syntactic pattern duplicated, but so also is the semantic relation between 'walking', 'standing', 'sitting' taken up and exploited in the form of the whole. Once more Hopkins can speak for himself: Poetry is in fact speech only employed to carry the inscape of speech for the inscape's sake - and therefore the inscape must be dwelt on. Now if this can be done without repeating it, Once of the inscape will be enough for art and beauty and poetry but then at least the inscape must be understood as so standing by itself that it could be</page><page sequence="13">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 349 copied and repeated. If not, repetition, oftening, over-and-overing, aftering of the inscape must take place in order to detach it to the mind and in this light poetry is speech which afters and oftens its inscape. (Lecture notes 'Poetry and Verse') The second question might be framed as follows : if what underwrites the possibility both of prosody and discourse is one and the same, then what constitutes the difference between them? If both significance or communi? cation, and aesthetic awareness and creation are grounded in the same epistemological relation, then what distinguishes a poem from a statement of fact, since the latter too, along with all that is intelligible possesses its own inscape, and is in fact a structural analogue of the situation it represents or 'puts'? The answer implicit I think in an extract from Hopkins' notebook dated 'Feb. gth 1868' is as follows: Nothing objectively present as a feature of the inscape enables one to distinguish between them. They are nevertheless distinct in terms of the manner in which they are present to consciousness. The former, the work of art, is an object of comtemplation, the latter, the statement, is an object of understanding, of ' de-coding ' as it were. Hopkins in this extract distinguishes contemplation and reason as two distinct kinds of mental energy. Nevertheless what he has in mind I believe can be under? stood without resort to such explicitly psychological jargon. Take, for example, a sentence which might be considered ambiguous with regard to its status either as poetic, or discursive ; I have in mind Rousseau's 'Man is born free | but is everywhere in chains.' [The caesura is, of course, mine.] As it stands, it qualifies by Hopkins' criteria as poetry. Nevertheless it means what it does in the ordinary discursive way. One might perhaps say that qua mere political statement of fact, it merely points to, signifies, that intolerable situation which it represents. Qua poetry however, its signifi? cation, its concrete analogue, is not so much ignored as 'taken up into it" (I can say it no better) and its characteristic instress, here its irony [an actual feature of the situation evident only in detached contemplation) is modelled, frozen into the very syntax of its verbal expression. Both art and communication rely entirely on the awareness of structural analogues. In art, however, there is no transition from one structure to the other, the former does not signify the latter. Rather, all structures present to consciousness at any time as analogous, are caught up in the work itself and remain there as its meaning, to be contemplated. How else could a work of art lose or acquire significance (not merely critical esteem) over a period of time? Think of how 'Hamlet', post-Freud, has acquired a further dimension of meaning, yet this IS not its meaning! 'Hamlet' is not about the Oedipus complex nor does its aesthetic value reside in any putatively remarkable anticipation of psycho-analytic discoveries. Rather, all that it can mean is drawn into it, is there concretely expressed and discernible to the critical and contemplative eye as a further feature of its structure. A work of art can age</page><page sequence="14">350 HYWEL THOMAS and visibly acquire significance just like the human face, which is in no sense about life though a lifetime can be written there. Finally, from the extract itself: Works of art of course like words utter the idea and in representing real things convey the prepossession (Later 'instress') with more or less success. The further in anything as a work of art, the organisation is carried out, the deeper the form penetrates, the ' instress ' flushes the matter, the more effect will be required in apprehension, the more power of comparison, the more capacity for receiving that synthesis of (either successive or spatially distinct) impressions which gives us the unity with the 'instress' conveyed by it. So much for Hopkins' philological, epistemological and aesthetic theories. I have tried so far, in philosophically reconstructing them, to show how all three merge and point to a summary conclusion with regard to the nature of poetry; a conclusion which provides I think a context in which his subsequent rejection of his art is best understood. Poetry is not essentially distinct from discursive language, indeed, in a sense, is its root and source. The aesthetic object is not essentially distinct from the ordinary object of awareness, indeed in a sense, pre-dates it. But then poetry and indeed art in general is as rooted in the mundane as is human consciousness. The poetic is indeed a specific mode of awareness in general, but it cannot possibly be an awareness of anything specifically different. Ultimately, its beauty too stands alongside the beauty of this world, is no more than a development of it; is no more sacred than it, and cannot pretend to transcend it. Beauty of its very nature is earth-bound, is profane. But the eyes of a priest must be directed elsewhere. Knowledge, even aesthetic contemplation of this world, however enobling, is ultimately a distraction from the only goal worthy of the devout ; the realization of that beatific vision of the transcendent, of God Himself in heaven, whose over? whelming instress transforms, transfigures and redeems. In the meantime through his art to develop further the forms of the profane would be nothing less than perverse. For Hopkins as yet, there could.be no natural means of progression from the beauty of this world to the beauty of its creator. Until such time as its possibility could be philosophically demon? strated, then his work was at an end. We see the glories of the earth But not the hand that wrought them all: Night to a myriad worlds gives birth, Yet like a lighted empty hall Where stands no host at door or hearth Vacant creation's lamps appal. A further philosophical accommodation was clearly required, and in the next section I shall try to show how, through his interpretation of Scotus' philosophical writings, this was to be effected.</page><page sequence="15">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 351 II A month or so before embarking on the second stage of his novitiate - a three-year course in philosophy - Hopkins noted in his diary 18 May 1870): One day when the bluebells were in bloom I wrote the following, ' I do not think I have ever seen anything more beautiful than the bluebell I have been looking at. I know the beauty of our Lord by it. It (s inscape) is (mixed of) strength and grace like an ash (tree).' [Hopkins' own parentheses] Clearly the spirit of this entry is in marked contrast to that of the poem 'Nondum' quoted at the end of section I. Yet the manner in which it is expressed - ' One day... I wrote the following ' - evinces a certain tentative ness, the presence of intellectual reservations. It is almost as though Hopkins were to say 'This is what I would like to say, like to believe', but in the absence of a philosophical demonstration of its possibility, remains no more than a feeling, something aberrant deserving of note rather than an objective something to be asserted with confidence. Two years later, however, in July of 1872, Hopkins writes: At this time I had first begun to get hold of the copy of Scotus on the ' Sentences ' in the Baddely library and was flush with a new stroke of enthusiasm. It may come to nothing or it may be a mercy from God. But just then when I took in any inscape of the sky or sea I thought of Scotus. The work to which he refers is John Duns Scotus' philosophical com? mentary on the 'Sentences' of Petrus Lombardus (a compilation and exegesis of theological texts drawn from the fathers of the early church). The commentaries delivered at Oxford ' 1300 ' and now commonly des? ignated the 'Opus Oxoniense' contain much discussion of perhaps the major epistemological issue of the middle ages : To what extent is a natural theology possible, if indeed at all? Here, the word 'natural' is of cardinal importance, i.e. what is being asked is whether the human faculty of reason in its normal employment, that is directed towards its natural temporal environment, can issue in true and informative propositions concerning that which transcends it, God's ultimate nature or essence. (It should be noted of course that our actual possession of such knowledge, and its absolute truth as authoritatively ex? pressed in the dogma of the church, was beyond dispute. Nevertheless the epistemological question regarding the manner of its acquisition remained.) Reworking, as it were, within a theological context, the dispute between Platonism and Aristotelianism concerning the transcendence or immanence of the ' Forms ' (the ultimate objects of genuine knowledge), and their relation to the palpable world of sense experience, two broad points of view had already emerged during the middle ages prior to Scotus. At the risk of</page><page sequence="16">352 HYWEL THOMAS gross over-simplification one might say that the Neo-platonist inspired Augustinians, in the stress they laid upon the 'super-natural' origin of such knowledge, its revelatory nature, an illumination of the divine uncreated light, a freely granted epiphany, tended towards a negative answer. On the other hand, Henry of Ghent (whose arguments are sys? tematically considered and opposed throughout the 'Opus Oxoniense') and the Aristotelian Aquinas, though giving pre-eminence to the authority of revelation as a source of knowledge, nevertheless maintained that such knowledge was also naturally attainable. For Henry, this was so in a highly qualified sense through his espousal of the view that all that may rationally be inferred of God's nature is that He is wow-finite, wow-material, wow-composite, etc. - the so-called 'via negativa' of the Pseudo-Dionysius. Aquinas, while accepting such an analysis of certain of God's attributes was, however, fully aware of the manifold difficulties to be encountered in extending the notion of negative determination to cover apparently positive terms such as 'just', 'merciful', 'good', 'wise', etc. all of which traditionally laid claim to being equally truly predicable of God. His answer then was to claim that such positive truths concerning God's nature might be arrived at by some process of analogically extending their appli? cation beyond the world of human experience. Between the two views Duns Scotus, with considerable philosophical skill and logical acumen, carefully steered a middle course; thereby no doubt, earning the designation 'Doctor Subtilis'. Briefly his view was that God's own attributes can be known naturally and directly in and from our temporal existence though in a manner other than, and superior to, what was for him the ultimately unintelligible inferential and analogical mode advocated by Henry and Aquinas. Secondly, such knowledge, though greater than the theoretical knowledge THAT God is wise, good, just, etc. still falls short of direct awareness of God, as it were, IN his wisdom, goodness and justice, which could only be granted as an act of God's will in the beatific vision itself. Perhaps this subtle (and for Hopkins I shall claim, crucial) difference between Scotus and, on the one hand Augustine, on the other, Aquinas, can best be rendered as follows. It is possible to distinguish if not psychologically, then at least logically, awareness that God is just, from awareness of God as just, in the sense (a) that the latter, though not the former, involves awareness of God himself; and (b) that the latter entails the former though not vice versa. Now Aquinas I think would have maintained that the former is independently possible, whereas Augustine would have claimed that awareness of God as just must, in an important sense, be prior both epistemologically and in time (either historical or personal) to the former. Both views have their difficulties. For Augustine natural reason ultimately can have no place in such</page><page sequence="17">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 353 knowledge, since its source, whether it be communicated in a veritable epiphany or as an intellectual illumination of the uncreated light, is in either case an autonomous, freely willed act of the transcendent ; a revelation to be awaited in all patience and humility, possibly ' recollected ' in Platonic style ; or accepted in the meantime by faith, on the authority of the saints ; but in any case not susceptible of being arrived at by any process of ratiocination or natural perception. Aquinas on the other hand, in maintaining that we can naturally become aware that God is just without necessarily being aware of God Himself, has to steer a dangerous course between the Scylla of anthropomorphism and the Charybdis of vacuity. Either in the statement 'God is just', the predicate retains the same meaning as in (say) 'Solomon is just' in which case God's justice seems to be identified with man's, clearly a theological solecism, or on the other hand if it does not retain the same meaning, it becomes difficult to see how 'God is just' might mean anything at all! Between univocality and equivocation Aquinas places analogy. That is, he believes that a man's being just somehow resembles God's being just. Scotus, however, is understandably puzzled by the difficulty of explaining how one could ever become aware of the presence of an analogy between two terms in the absence of direct acquaintence with one of them. In other words, analogy though undeniably important, crucially so in Hopkins' aesthetics as we have seen, cannot be extended beyond the realm of possible objects of human experience. Indeed any attempt to do so issues in fatuousness. The case cannot be better put than in Scotus' own words : God is conceived not so much in a concept analogous to the concept of a creature, that is, one which is wholely other than that which is predicated of creatures, but rather in some concept univocal to Himself and to a creature. If you maintain that this is not true, but that the formal concept of what pertains to God is another notion, a disconcerting consequence ensues; namely that from the proper notion of anything found in creatures, nothing at all can be inferred about God, for the notion of what is in each is wholely different. We would have no more reason to conclude that God is formally wise from the notion of wisdom derived from creatures than we would have reason to conclude that God is formally a stone. For it is possible to form another notion of a stone to which the notion of a created stone bears some relation, for instance stone as an idea in God. And so we could say formally 'God is a stone' according to this analogous concept, just as we say 'He is wise' according to another analogous concept. His own solution is ingenious and, logically, extremely complex. It is as though he manages to insert between the notions 'awareness that God is just' and 'awareness of God adjust' a third possibility -' awareness of Justice as Gods '.That is, though God Himself is not present in the world, His attributes nevertheless literally are; Justice, Wisdom, Love as they appear within the mundane are not so much human attributes which somehow resemble the divine, but are rather, one and the same - His. Consider in this context Tolstoy's</page><page sequence="18">354 HYWEL THOMAS famous epigraph to Anna Karenina ? 'Vengeance is mine. I will repay.' Furthermore, knowledge that this is so (that Justice is God's; that His essential attributes are immanent), for Scotus would by no means require divine illumination. On the contrary, was already established as a conse? quence of his major logico-metaphysical thesis - the univocality of tran? scendental predicates between created and uncreated Being (of which, much more later). Given even the theological dogma that God is identical with His essential attributes (that God IS Love, Justice, etc.) Scotus is still protected from the objection that he has thus rendered God wholly im? manent, by his use of the notion 'Haeceitas' (individualized form), enabling him to say that God Himself, i.e. the individualized form of His nature remains transcendent, appearing only as an act of God's grace in the beatific vision, whereas His attributes are severally immanent and are constituted as possible objects of contemplation for the human intellect. Leaving for the moment the tortuousness of scholastic argument, that 'heady' mixture of Logic, Metaphysics and Theology so characteristic of the medieval philosopher along with its formidable 'technical vocabulary' so alien to more recent philosophical trends ; it should be clear at any rate how the conclusion at which Scotus had arrived could provide a solution to the difficulties in which Hopkins had become embroiled both intellectually and conscientiously. Given the validity of its demonstration, then the failure to extend the logical role of analogy beyond the temporal world, though remaining true would now be irrelevant; the crucial choice between the beauty of this world and that of its creator since the two are essentially one and the same, would be rendered manifestly vacuous. All then remaining would be the religious duty of acknowledging it, of joyfully rendering oneself a channel for, and further development of, that beauty. What do then? how meet beauty? Merely meet it; own, Home at heart, heaven's sweet gift; then leave, let that alone. (Poem 'To What Serves Mortal Beauty?') All this would depend however, upon being able to exhibit beauty as logi? cally incorporated within the category of what Scotus would have called 'Transcendental attributes'. Furthermore, however opportune and prag? matically useful for Hopkins the Scotist conclusion, it might be bought at too high an intellectual price. That is, the manner in which 'beauty' would have to be understood in order to exhibit it in this way, might be in radical conflict with the conclusions already well established in his mind by 1868. Nevertheless if one unravels in some detail the strands of Scotus' argument and struggles to render intelligible in contemporary terms his unfamiliar metaphysical terminology - the ' lingua franca ' of Scholastic philosophy ; there is discernible a train of thought which not only reaches for Hopkins the appropriate theological conclusion, but in the process may plausibly</page><page sequence="19">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 355 be interpreted as confirming and amplifying his own epistemological and aesthetic theories as reconstructed in Section I. What follows in the remainder of this paper is an attempt to do just this. Whether or not the interpretation given of Scotus is correct, I am in no doubt as to its being a coherently possible interpretation and more than this, of its being most likely the manner in which Hopkins himself understood him, He... who of all men most sways my spirit to peace ; Of realty the rarest-veined unraveller ; a not Rivalled insight, be rival Italy or Greece. (Duns Scotus' Oxford) First of all though, a 'caveat'. The whole business of trying to understand the thought of someone as distant from us both in time and culturally as Scotus (or even, to a lesser degree, Hopkins himself) is fraught with the danger of unwittingly permitting our own cultural orientation to colour the interpretation we make of him. Such sympathetic attempts very often result in exhibiting their subjects as somehow peculiarly 'modern', of detaching them from and somehow rendering them incongruous within, their own cultural environment, of making it seem as though they would after all be more at home in ours. Generally speaking, such an outcome is at least as likely an indication of a lack of critical and historical imagination on our part as it is our subject's being as it were 'born before his time'. To a certain extent, I believe W. H. Gardner, in the account he gives of the influence of Scotus upon Hopkins (Introduction to the Penguin Selection of G.M.H.'s Poems and Prose) is guilty of misrepresenting both in this way. There for instance he says : This theologian seemed to give him a sanction for doing as a Christian poet what, as a Jesuit priest, he could not possibly do, that is assert his individuality. His underlying assumption seems to be that a poet, almost by definition, is concerned with his own subjectivity and is consequently bound to find irksome if not intolerable, pressures towards conformity whether insidious as in society in general, or explicitly demanded by an organization as disci? plined as the Jesuits. Such a comparatively recent prejudice has not just its proper place of origin, but also perhaps its only legitimate sphere of application in the Romantic movement and tradition. Despite the import? ance undeniably attached by Hopkins to the notion 'Self, to confuse the philosophical idea of individuality here stressed with the somewhat senti? mental subjectivity of the romantic poet-'self-hood' with 'Myself as it were - is to misconstrue radically his insight. With the exception of that despairing group of sonnets 'Carrion Comfort', Hopkins is seldom con? cerned with His self at all ; on the contrary his eyes are ecstatically directed outwards towards the self-hood, the glorious haeceity, of all that surrounds</page><page sequence="20">356 HYWEL THOMAS him. Individuality here is an objective notion, far removed, as would befit a Jesuit, from the rebellious egotism of the romantic. Similarly, to think that, even if Hopkins' desire were indeed to 'assert his individuality', a sanction could be found for this in the writings of a medieval theologian, is not only to misunderstand the particular concept 'Haeceitas' and its philosophical employment, but to misrepresent the whole spirit in which philosophy/theology was discussed in the middle ages. It might be appropriate here, both as evidence of the intrinsic implausibility of Gardner's account, and as a ' mise en sc?ne ' for my elaboration of Scotus' argument, to quote at length the testimony of C. S. Peirce (the American logician-philosopher and contemporary of Hopkins) on Scotus in particular and medieval philosophy in general. Think of the manner in which Duns Scotus must have worked, who wrote his thirteen volumes in folio, in a style as condensed as the most condensed parts of Aristotle, before the age of thirty-four. Nothing is more striking in either of the great intellectual products of that age, than the complete absence of self-conceit on the part of artist or philosopher. That anything of value can be added to his sacred and catholic work by its having the smack of individuality about it, is what he has never conceived. His work is not designed to embody HIS ideas, but the universal truth; there will not be one thing in it, however minute, for which you will not find that he has his authority: and whatever originality emerges is ofthat inborn kind which so saturates a man that he cannot himself perceive it. The individual feels his own worthlessness in comparison with his task, and does not dare to introduce his vanity into the doing of it. Then there is no machine-work, no unthinking repetition about the thing. Every part is worked out for itself as a separate problem, no matter how analogous it may be in general to another part. And no matter how small and hidden a detail may be, it has been conscientiously studied, as though it were intended for the eye of God. In an attempt to emulate as far as possible something of the same spirit and technique of enquiry, it might not be inappropriate to proceed by commenting exegitically on a brief compilation of extracts from Scotus' writings ; extracts which I believe express succinctly, if somewhat recon ditely, that 'unrivalled insight' that so swayed Hopkins's spirit to peace. The translation is Wollter's (The Franciscan Institute of New York), Dixit Magister : Being is the first object of the intellect because in it a twofold primacy concurs, namely a primacy of commonness and of virtuality. For whatever is of itself intelligible either includes essentially the notion of being, or is contained essentially or virtually in something else which does include 'being' essentially... Being possesses attributes which are co-extensive with it such as 'one', 'true' and 'good'...All the attributes of Being are virtually included in Being and in those things which come under Being...To put it briefly then, Being is univocal to all... God cannot be known naturally unless Being is univocal to the created and uncreated... What we know of God is known through intelligible species of creatures... Thus it is that creatures which impress their own proper species on the</page><page sequence="21">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 357 intellect can also impress the species of the transcendental common to themselves and God... God Himself as this essence is not an object of natural knowledge for us; for if He be known in this way by an intellect other than his own, it is as a voluntary and not as a natural object. Therefore He cannot be known naturally by any created intellect precisely as 'this essence'. The metaphysical writings of Aristotle, the source of most of the technical vocabulary of medieval philosophy, bristles with expressions which may roughly be rendered in English by the word 'Being'. Greek, which unlike Latin, possesses in addition a definite article, is thereby able to signify syntactically a range of subtly different senses of this word which, unless one is prepared to resort to the most barbarously unidiomatic English, elude translation and clear comprehension. Four such syntactically distinct Greek constructions, of which Aristotle makes great use are: to e?vca (the 'to be') ; to t? rjv eivoci (the 'to be that which it is'-usually translated as 'Essence') ; to ov (that which is) ; and to ov t) ov (that which is, considered with reference neither to What it is, nor to how it is qualified - often rendered as 'Being qua Being'). The distinction between existence and essence ; between ' That something is' and ' What something is': between the verb 'to be' used without even an implicit grammatical complement (e.g. 'The world resounds with the joyful cry "I AMI"') and the copula of predication (e.g. 'Hopkins is a poet.') has been a philosophical commonplace for centuries. A philosopher may ask for instance 'What is it, to be/to exist?' - (t? to e?vai) or on the other hand - 'What is it, to be a poet?' (t? to TfoirjTf) dvai). Let us call the syntactic form on which these questions are expressed 'the infinitive mode'. Now what amounts to the same questions might be expressed in a different manner; we might call it the 'substantival mode'; e.g. 'What really, is something which exists?' - (t? to ov), and 'What really, is a poet?' - (t? ? Troir|Tr)?). Note, however, that none of these questions is equivalent to (the rather more comprehensible) 'What are things/poets like?'. They are, a medieval philosopher would say, requests for the ratio essendi" as opposed to the 'ratio cognoscendi ' of something ; a request for the formative principle or process which actually constitutes or produces something or other as a thing of a determinate kind as opposed to a set of criteria for its classification. (Think, for instance, how the diagnosis of, say, cancer is distinct from an under? standing of carcinogenesis as a biological process of cell mutation.) Now this distinction (between essence and existence) is certainly present in Aristotle, as it is also in current existentialist thought. For Aristotle, however, the first question - t? to e?vca or t? to ov is glossed in such a way as to render existence logically subordinate to essence; (the existential use of the verb to be, subordinate to its copulative use). This is expressed most concisely in the much used quotation from the Metaphysics (i028b4) - t? to ov to?to eori t?? f| o?cra- (the question 'What really is that which is?' is</page><page sequence="22">358 HYWEL THOMAS none other than 'What is substance?' i.e. a 'such-and-such', a kind of thing). The sense here might better be expressed by the equivalent 'infinitive mode' - t? to e?voci touto eotiv t? to t? fjv e?vai - (the question 'What is it to exist?' is none other than 'What is it, to be a "such and such"'?). That is, to exist, is none other than to instantiate this that or the other kind of thing. Nevertheless ' being a thing of this, that, or the other kind ' does not itself determine a class of entities (Aristotle expressly states - ' Posterior Analytics' 92b-14 - that there is no such class as might be designated 'The class of existents') but rather, signifies one sense of 'x isjy' (the copula of predication) ; one mode among others of'something's being such-and-such'; one division of 'Being qua Being' - to ov fj ov. Incidentally, that this metaphysical principle of Aristotle's antithetically defines Existentialism, becomes clear on comparing it with Sartre's even more abstruse dictum -'Being (qua 'being - human', at least) is Not-to-be that which one is, and To-be that which is not.' That is, Being, for us, is permanently to elude and transcend comprehension in any classificatory formula whatever, and (authentically) to constitute ourselves negatively, as the other of all such formulae that, in as much as they are contingently true of us, purport to capture our essence. Latin, in the absence of the definite article, is restricted to the substantival mode of expression of these basically Aristotelian notions. The actual word used here by Scotus is 'Ens' which, unfortunately for us, is syntactically ambiguous between to ov (that which is - the determinable subject) and 'to ov t\ fj ov - Being Itself (the Gerund). The semantic distinction is no more marked syntactically in English than in Latin, but I think might become clearer through consideration of the following example. I may say ' This is a crossing', while pointing at an intersection of two roads, in which case the word italicized operates as a common noun. On the other hand I might utter the same sentence while illustrating the action itself, in which case the word operates as a gerund. The former is arguably derivative from the latter, i.e. as a completed instance of its material realization. In the same way ' Being ' or ' ens ' may be predicated substantially - ' in Quid ' as a medieval philosopher would say - (in which case it might be translated as 'a thing') or gerundially - ' in Quale substantiale ' as for instance if one were to say that ' being a man ' and ' being coloured ' were two ' beings... ' in the sense of two distinct kinds of 'being-something or other'. What Scotus has in mind here then I believe, is that one's first appre? hensions are of 'beings...'; of instantiations in one mode or another of Being - the gerund. One might be aware for instance merely that there is something present, or even that there is something absent ; and this regard? less of whether or not that ' Something ' is comprehended as being of this, that, or the other kind. All that can possibly constitute an object of awareness is ipso facto and primarily 'a being... (whatever)'. This, however, is not</page><page sequence="23">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 359 'a Being' in the sense of to ov which already implies a 'such-and-such'; one of a kind of thing. Rather, it is ' a being... ' in the sense of to ov f) ov - an instance of 'Being qua Being' which transcends all such kinds. Think, for example, how the absence of something can itself directly be an object of awareness. Though it would be absurd to describe what we are aware of in such cases as a kind of (ghostly?) thing or even as some mysterious kind of property or attribute of a thing, yet it too, is a kind of 'being... '. Even the non? existent, as Aristotle would be the first to agree (Met. 1003b 11) in a certain sense IS. That is, the awareness of the absence of Xis nonetheless its presence to consciousness as absent from perception. It is in this sense then, that 'Being' is the primary object of the intellect; not only because when pre? dicated substantially or as a gerund, it holds of all there is as present to consciousness; its 'Commonness', but also because it is solely in virtue of the prior possession by something of this 'quasi-attribute' that any further attribute is predicable of it. This needs further elucidation. In an early logical treatise - ' The Categories ', Aristotle classifies attributes (the significata of words which may be used predicatively) according to their different modes of attachment to a subject. These intuitively distinct modes of attachment - the categories - he also equates elsewhere with ' modes of being'. For instance, 'Xis a man' and 'Zis black' though both instances of X's being (something or other), are distinct in the sense that 'man-ness' and 'blackness' seem to attach to X'm different ways. X, one might say is not a man in the same sense of'is' as that in which Zis black. It is this that locates the predicate 'man' in a different category from 'black' (the former in the category of Substance, i.e. What X is, and the latter in the category of Quality, i.e. how JSTis). Among the categories listed by Aristotle, that of Substance is given pride of place. It, strictly speaking, is two; that of primary, and that of secondary substance, the individual, and the genus which the individual instantiates. It is only secondary substance that is directly predicable of the individual (epistemologically, it is only as a 'such and such' that it can become a determinate object of awareness) ; all other predicates, in their attachment to the individual, are mediated by that of substance. See, for instance, ' Cate? gories ' 2 b-38: Further, it is because the primary substances are subjects for everything else, that they are called 'Substances' most strictly. But as the primary substances stand to everything else, so do the species and genera of the primary substances to all the rest; all the rest are predicated of these. That is, it is in virtue of ^s 'man-ness' (or some such substantial predi? cate) that 'black' is predicable of him. X is a man essentially and black, virtually ; or, 'man-n?ss' is contained essentially in X and blackness, virtually</page><page sequence="24">360 HYWEL THOMAS (i.e. mediated by his man-ness). X, however, in its presence to awareness as something essentially determinable (a primary intelligible) is first and fore? most 'a being', in the sense already explained; i.e. contains essentially the notion of Being. Man-ness on the other hand, which is also an intelligible, though not a primary intelligible, is something essentially contained in some? thing else (i.e. X) which includes 'being' essentially, and is therefore an essential qualification or determination of the being of X, i.e. X is, or is present to consciousness, in the mode 'man'. 'Black' and all predicates from one or other of the remaining categories are virtually contained in that which includes 'Being' essentially, and therefore also constitute further (though accidental, and mediate) determinations of the ultimate determinable 'Being qua Being'. In this way Scotus seeks to show that since all awareness that something or other is the case requires the mediate notion of 'Being...' (the meta? physical correlate of the necessary presence of the copula in all subject predicate propositions), all concepts (intelligibles) susceptible of being linked by the copula in a judgement or proposition, must signify determinations in one mode or another of the transcendent notion 'Being Itself - have as their ultimate reference to ov f) ov - 'Ens'. Logically then, Being has a primacy of commonness or virtuality over all concepts. Epistemologically, all knowledge has as its ultimate object 'Being qua Being'. Metaphysically, the intelligibility of anything whatever consists in its instantiating in one mode or another the notion 'Being'. Theologically, in as much as 'Being qua Being' is identified with the Godhead, it expresses the creaturely dependence of all, for its being, upon God the Creator Uncreated. Scotus then, is a metaphysical realist. That is, not only are concrete individuals for him, objectively real, but so too are natural kinds and species. They are by no means the mere product of conventional and ultimately arbitrary classificatory schemata, but are on the contrary, natural entities, literally present, whose informing principles (??yoi) are susceptible of scientific discovery and formulation in real as opposed to verbal definitions. Of such then, the term 'Being' may be predicated 'in quid', i.e. gram? matically, as a noun. Mankind one might say, is a being in the substantival sense; a natural class, an object of scientific inquiry. 'Man-ness' on the other hand, is a 'being...' in the gerundial sense, a determinate mode of being 'contained essentially' in mankind (its realization) as its common nature. The phrase 'the Uncreated Being' connotes that whose being is inde? pendent both logically and materially, of the being of anything else what? ever. Since all that is, insofar as it is, instantiates in one mode or another Being qua Being, there can be but one determinable subject that is inde? pendent in the required sense, and that is none other than Being itself 'Ens'. This, to ov fj ov is in the Neo-Platonist style identified with the</page><page sequence="25">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 361 being that pertains to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ; the God who announced himself to Moses on the slopes of Mount Horeb (Ex. 3. 14) and cried from afar to St Augustine (Confessions, bk 7. ch. 16) ' I AM that I AM '. 'Being' then is univocal to all. That is, the term 'being', in whatever sense it is used (in whatever categorial context the copula occurs), maintains throughout a constant reference to the single notion 'Ens'. As it stands, this insight was by no means a novel contribution of his. Aristotle before him has stressed several times in the Metaphysics, for example, at ioo3b5 (to ov A?yeToa ttoAAccxcoc \?kv ?AA? -rr?v Tipos H?av apxi?v that '"being" is used in various senses, but always with reference to one principle'. For Scotus, however, 'Being' is something more than an immanent principle. Indeed for him all universals - that is, each general concept, is produced as a modifi? cation of the intellect not so much by a process of selective abstraction of common resemblances from among a multitude of individuals, but has, rather, as its origin and root cause a palpably real 'Common nature', totally contained, and in principle discernible to the intellect even in a single individual instance. The ontological status of Being then, is nearer that of a Platonic Form; Being Itself, IS, and all else that is in a qualified sense, instantiates it. The different senses of ' being ' are then, as it were, different modes of instantiation of that which is one and the same. In this way Scotus forges the first epistemological link between the mun? dane and the divine. The term 'being' when predicated both of God and of a creature, is not predicated equivocally in each case. Its reference, 'Being qua Being', 'Ens' is one His Uncreated Being. Thus, to know something of 'Being', even as exemplified by the modified and derivative being of a creature, is to know something that pertains to God Himself, since all ' Being ' is His. Building on this first principle, Scotus' argument then proceeds, as we shall see, by showing that any term predicated directly of'Ens', prior to its division into the categorial modes - (and what this entails, will be explained below) - must similarly be univocal between Created and Uncreated Being. Such a term then, will also signify a single property in which, to be sure, all derivative or created being participates, but which is possibly an attribute of the Uncreated Being, and is therefore divine. It should now be clear that one cannot proceed further to ask of 'Being? s-Being' what it is; cannot require an account or definition of the essence of Essence itself. In this sense then, 'Being-^a-Being' must remain an irre? ducibly simple notion; 'It is not HOW things are in the world that is mystical, but THAT it exists.' (Wittgenstein, Tractatus 6. 44.) This for Scotus, however, along with most medieval philosophers does not mean that nothing is truly predicable of Ens. On the contrary, there are certain terms which are immediately predicable of it prior to and independently of its division into its categorial modes. Such terms signify attributes which as Scotus says are virtually (though not essentially) contained in Being. Expressing</page><page sequence="26">3^2 HYWEL THOMAS this in theological terms, one might say, we can know that it must be the case that God is (say) merciful, though not (which would be a religious solecism) that God must be merciful. It is precisely these terms that Scotus calls the ' transcendental attributes of being ' an elucidation of which can be delayed no longer. Aristotle had of course known that certain terms, whose grammatical role is most certainly predicative, nevertheless eluded th? ' net ' of his categorial scheme - that catalogue of different modes of attachment of an attribute to an individual subject. 'Good' for instance he says (Ethics I. 6) 'has as many senses as ' Being ' since it is predicable in all the categories. Similarly ' True ' he emphasises in many places (particularly 'De Interpretatione' 16a 9-19) is predicable only where there is 'combination', where two thoughts (concepts) are brought together by the copula in a judgement or prop? osition; only in cases, one might say, of 'something's being something or other'. Perhaps an example drawn from the 'De Interpretatione' (20b 31) best illustrates his point. There, Aristotle is concerned with the following apparent anomaly: whereas from the facts that 'Xis white' and ' X'\s a man' it seems to follow that X is a white man ; from the facts that ' X is good ' and 'Xh a cobbler' it does not follow that Zis a good cobbler. The same would hold if'true'/'actual' or 'unique' were substituted for 'good'. The anomalous 'logical chemistry' of such attributes - that is, the fact that they do not seem to form ' natural compounds ' with terms predicated in the category of Substance (which represent what something is, its quiddity) as would any term drawn from one of the subordinate categories - might be seen as evidence for the fact that they are not directly predicated of a primary substance (an individual) as would any term from the category of (second? ary) substance ; nor even directly of secondary substance and mediately of an individual, as would any term from the remaining categories. They must therefore transcend the categories and in so doing, signify attributes which directly qualify 'Being' itself, prior to its division into its categorial modes. With regard to these three terms then, one might say that in a case of some attribute F's being predicated of some individual 'a', it is neither a nor F which is good, or true or unique, but rather 'a's being F' that is so qualified. Their role is adverbial in a real sense. A good cobbler is not so much one of a special kind of cobbler, but one who cobbles well', a true cobbler, one who is a cobbler actually, a, unique cobbler, one who solely (if I may be excused the pun) exemplifies his kind. It is in this sense that such terms were considered to signify attributes of'Being...', rather than of things, or quiddities. If this much is granted, then 'Beauty too, though not to my knowledge explicitly discussed by Scotus, manifestly qualifies for inclusion among the transcendentals. Helen, after all, however beautiful a woman, is not beautiful and a woman, though Hans Sachs the old cobbler is both old and a cobbler. Scotus, however, and indeed several other medieval philosophers</page><page sequence="27">HOPKINS AND SCOTUS 363 were prepared to go even further than this. The transcendentals, they claimed, were not merely qualifications of 'Being...', but were in a sense which I shall attempt to explain, synonymous with 'Being...'. As Alexander of Hales puts it: Unum verum et bonum convertuntur cum ente [One, true and good are interchangeable with being] or in Kant's formulation : Quodlibet ens est unum, verum, bonum [Whatever is, is one is true, is good]. The question that immediately arises is 'How can three terms which clearly differ in meaning nevertheless all be synonymous with a fourth?' Surely, they must then be synonymous with each other and therefore cannot after all differ in meaning ! Yet this is indisputably the paradoxical way in which the medieval theologian thought of God in relation to His attributes. 'God' as the scriptures aver 'is love' (a statement of identity) not merely 'loveable' nor even 'loving'. Inasmuch as God is just or merciful, the same would hold, with the result that God's love was viewed as being one and the same as God's mercy, as God's justice; one and the same indeed as God Himself. It is Scotus' notion of 'Haeceitas' (thisness) -the notion of an individualized form, I think, which saves such a belief from absurdity, as I hope the following illustration (adapted from Peter Geach) will show. To add 2 to a number, to multiply a number by 2, to square a number, are three distinct operations (three distinct mathematical functions) which when applied to a specified number, produce three distinct results, e.g. for 3, the results 5, 6 and 9 respectively. In the number 4, however, and only in the number 4, all three functions are simultaneously realized ; it is at once, and indifferently 2 plus 2, 2 times 2 and 2 squared. All three expressions have the same reference, namely the number 4. Now all this might well be expressed in something approaching the language of the schoolmen in the following manner : the number 4, or as we might say, four-ness itself actualizes three distinct attributes of'four-being', each of which we see it must possess though not one of them, nor indeed all three together, constitute a definition of what 'four-being' is. Transcendental attributes then, which qualify not so much things in this world but rather, the 'being-what-they-are' of things in this world, in Scotus' analysis, properly signify attributes of 'Being-o/wa-Being'; of that ultimate simple entity (God) which sustains the 'being... ' of all else besides. To reveal them as present in the world of creatures is veritably to recognise God Himself; to celebrate them, an act of worship. In as much as beauty figures among them, then the Subtle Doctor's insight patently provided Hopkins with the theological justification he so desperately sought for his craft. But what of its relation to his earlier aesthetic theorisings? Here again, I believe, their confirmation is to be found in Scotus. In the formulation of the medieval motto favoured by Kant and cited above, the transcendental attributes are clearly viewed as literally ubiqui? tous ; ' Whatever is, is one, is true, is good ' and (one might add) ' is beautiful '.</page><page sequence="28">364 HYWEL THOMAS This at first sight seems at odds with our employment of the notion 'beauty'. Granting even that 'beautiful' qualifies neither Helen nor womanhood but rather, her 'being-a-woman', surely the term must be withheld from the 'woman-being' instantiated by (say) Maritornes of 'Don Quixote'. Yet, one might argue, were Maritornes' individualized form, her haeceity delin? eated in all its manifold detail, then we should see how uniquely, how truly, how perfectly even how beautifully she embodies or realizes it; then, even here, God's beauty might be found. In other words, the beauty of anything whatever, as both Kant and Hegel would agree, resides in its adequately realizing and embodying in palpable form, its own inner nature: the 'Zweckm?ssigkeit ohne Zweck' (finality without purposes) of Kant; the 'Selbstzweck' (self-purpose) of Hegel. The task of the poet then, is to present, to put the glorious haeceity of things; to delineate lovingly their 'inscape'; to impress upon consciousness their 'intelligible species'. Then, and to the extent that this is successfully accomplished, the Being which sustains them, the instress which informs them is also accomplished and its own divine features revealed. As kingfishers catch fire, dragonfires draw flame; As tumbled over rim in roundy wells Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's Bow swung finds tongue to fling abroad its name; Each mortal thing does one thing and the same; Deals out that being indoors each one dwells; Selves - goes itself; MYSELF it speaks and spells, Crying WHAT I DO IS ME : FOR THAT I CAME. I say more; the just man justices; Keeps grace: that k?eps all his goings graces; Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is - Christ - for Christ plays in ten thousand places, Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his To the Father through the features of men's faces.
