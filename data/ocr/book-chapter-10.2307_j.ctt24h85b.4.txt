Clarke Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga, New South Wales Introduction Hay Cave is one of many limestone caves in the tropical Mitchell-Palmer area of north  Queensland. Archaeologically, its major significance is a lengthy, more than 30,000 year-long,  cultural sequence, with good preservation of faunal remains as well as stone artefacts and an  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="4"> 28 Harry Lourandos et al. abundance of rock art. Thus, it offers the opportunity to investigate long-term local archaeological  trends in one site and to compare these with regional trends obtained from a wider range of  sites throughout this archaeologically rich area (David and Lourandos 1997). How can these  long-term cultural trends be characterised from an individual site? In what ways do they reflect  wider regional trends and patterns? How do they compare with palaeoenvironmental trends?  And, at a more general level, how can we connect different spatial scales of investigation (the  local or site-specific and the regional) when seeking to explore long-term cultural trends? These  were the questions guiding the research. As a limestone cave with alkaline soils and good preservation, Hay Cave is well endowed in  different kinds of archaeological materials, raising also the question of the relationship between  different lines of archaeological evidence when exploring cultural trends through time. To what  degree does each category of archaeological material represent independent sets of evidence,  and to what degree can they be related inter-textually? With such questions in mind, the  stone artefacts, animal bone, land-snail shell, mussel shell, brush-turkey egg shell, charcoal and  hearths of Hay Cave are examined here in relation to wider regional chronological patterns for  Cape York Peninsula (see David and Lourandos 1998). A large number of AMS radiocarbon  determinations were obtained to investigate these data in adequate chrono-stratigraphic  detail. The Mitchell-Palmer limestone zone The Mitchell-Palmer limestone zone is part of the Chillagoe Formation, located 180 km  northwest of Cairns, north Queensland, Australia (Figure 1). The individual limestone towers  (‘bluffs’) often exceed 1 km in length and 500 m in width, jutting up to 150 m above the  surrounding landscape (Figure 2). These are impressive rock formations, possessing regionally  distinctive lithologies and sediments (e.g. Galloway et al. 1970; Day et al. 1983:85), vegetation  communities (e.g. Galloway et al. 1970) and fauna (for preliminary results, see Hall et al.  1996; Macrokanis 1996; see also Stanisic and Ingram 1998) in an otherwise dry sclerophyll  landscape. The Chillagoe Formation outcrops towards the western margin of the Hodgkinson  Province as a steeply dipping, discontinuous belt running parallel to the Palmerville Fault line.  The unit extends over a distance of approximately 150 km and varies in width from 10 km  to a few hundred metres. Regional magnetic imagery indicates that the Chillagoe Formation  continues beneath ground cover to the north in a north-northeasterly direction (Domagala and  Fordham 1997). The Chillagoe Formation consists of varying proportions of limestone, chert, basalt, arenite  and mudstone, conglomerate and breccia. Limestone is the characteristic lithology. Given the  geological components and an estimated early Silurian age (about 428 million years), the  limestone belt probably was deposited as calcareous muds and coral reefs; earth movements  since deposition have folded and tilted the limestone into its current vertical position. Where  erosion has removed the surrounding material, the limestone is now exposed as numerous  towers of variable height and size (Domagala and Fordham 1997; Stanisic 1997). Vegetation on the Chillagoe Formation limestone outcrops is deciduous microphyll vine  thicket. This is a stunted vine forest in which the canopy closes at 3 m to 9 m above the ground,  with the majority of emergents deciduous, together with many understorey species existing as  deciduous or semi-evergreen plants. The vine thickets lose their leaves in response to a drop in  moisture availability, and the ready supply of leaf litter provided by the vegetation fills the rock  crevices to further enhance the water-conserving properties of the limestone outcrops (Kahn  and Lawie 1987). Fensham (1995, 1996) denoted these vine thickets as a floristically distinct  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="5"> Hay Cave: A 30,000-year cultural sequence from the Mitchell-Palmer limestone zone, north Queensland, Australia 29 group restricted mainly to limestone karst; the limestone substrate forms an additional natural  fire barrier. Within the Chillagoe Formation, individual limestone towers are isolated by open  woodland eucalypt communities devoid of limestone (Rowe et al. 2001). Climate is semi-arid,  with a highly seasonal rainfall regime, falling predominately in the months of December to  March. The enhanced humidity-preserving qualities of the limestone outcrops, particularly in  caves surrounded by vine thickets, are especially relevant to long-term cultural trends spanning  drier and wetter climatic phases, as at Hay Cave (see below). The limestone outcrops are typically surrounded by alkaline rocky pediments conducive to  the preservation of organic materials such as bone, egg shell and land-snail shell. In some rare  instances, archaeological excavations have recovered well-preserved late-Holocene wooden  digging sticks and other ‘soft’ organic items in buried cave sediments, including ancient fungus,  fig fruit and Pandanus nuts (David and Dagg 1993). Hundreds of shallow rockshelters and  also deep caves occur near the junction of the towers and their pediments. Some of these caves  extend hundreds of metres into the rock, most often in pitch-black conditions, but also at  times illuminated by roof collapses and sinkholes creating skylit chambers. While no evidence  of people has ever been found in these deeper recesses, archaeological evidence of Aboriginal  occupation is abundant in more open rockshelters and sunlit cave entrances. There is also ample  evidence of Aboriginal presence on the plains surrounding the towers, particularly in the form  of partly buried and surface stone artefact scatters. Hay Cave Hay Cave is a large limestone cave positioned between the Mitchell and Palmer rivers,  towards the northern limits of the Mitchell-Palmer limestone belt and approximately 140  km west of the eastern Australian coastline, at 16o6’S latitude and 144o7’E longitude (Figures  1 and 3). The site was recorded during Bruno David’s Mitchell-Palmer archaeological site  surveys as site number PM18 (being the 18th archaeological site recorded in this programme),  and also by the Chillagoe Caving Club under its speleological site number MP118. Hay Cave  is situated at the southern end of Wilson’s Tower, accessible from the east, with a large entrance  (16 m wide, 3 m high and 10 m deep) (Figure 3). It sits at the base of the limestone tower, atop  a small scree covered in vine thicket that slopes down to a surrounding plain of open sclerophyll  forest. The cave entrance itself is positioned slightly above the level of the flat, soft cave floor  within the overhang. Sunlight is subdued immediately inside the overhang, towards the centre  of the entrance chamber. Here, where the floor is flat and sediments are soft, archaeological  excavations were undertaken by Bruno David, Harry Lourandos and Chris Clarkson in 1996  (Figures 3 and 4). Four juxtaposed 50 x 50 cm squares were excavated, the deepest of which  (M30) was removed in 63 Excavation Units (XU) of mean 2.0 cm thickness and following  Stratigraphic Units (SU) where visible (Figure 5). Twenty-two distinct SUs were identified in  the deepest excavation square of 133 cm depth. Sediments containing cultural materials were  found at all depths except within the thick clays of SU3 at the very base of the excavations  (Table 1).  The four Hay Cave squares were excavated independently of each other. Cultural items &gt;2  cm maximum length were plotted in three dimensions and drawn on individual XU recording  forms during the course of the excavation. All other sediments were sieved in 3 mm mesh  sieves and bagged for later sorting in the laboratory. Sediment samples were collected from the  &lt;3 mm residue from each XU of each square. At the University of Queensland and Monash University, over the ensuing years Angela  Holden (1999) worked on the stone artefacts; Nicola Roche (1999) on the animal bone  following preliminary work by Neville Terlich (1998); Cassandra Rowe (1998) on the land- terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="6"> 30 Harry Lourandos et al. snail shell; Simon Clarke (2005) on the egg shell; and Bruno David (e.g. David et al. 1997) on  the rock art and chrono-stratigraphy. This, however, is the first full site report to appear and to  assemble the different lines of previously unpublished evidence to explore long-term temporal  trends.

Limestone towers of the Mitchell-Palmer limestone zone. Figure 3. Hay Cave, excavation in progress. The sediments Three major SU were revealed during the excavation (Figure 5). SU1, the uppermost, is  subdivided into 18 subunits (SU1a-SU1r). All subunits of SU1 are ashy, and at least seven well- demarcated hearths are represented. The latter appear in SU1b/1c; SU1d/1f; SU1e/1h/1i/1k;  SU1j; SU1m; SU1n; SU1q; and also probably SU1o. The other SU1 subunits are either of  ill-defined hearths or contain mixed ashy sediments from hearths lying above or from  those extending beyond the excavated deposits (SU1a, the ashy treadage zone; SU1l; SU1p;  SU1r). Thus, the entire period spanned by SU1, the uppermost unit, represents the intensive  construction of hearths within this part of the site. SU2, lying immediately below SU1, is divided into three subunits (SU2a, 2b and 2c), each  predominantly composed of silt and clay and variably rich in calcium carbonate concretions.  No in situ evidence of hearths has been recovered from this unit. SU3, the lowermost unit, is highly compact and clayey. Again, no stratigraphic evidence of  hearths has been recovered from this unit.  Each SU is described in greater detail in Table 2. terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="8"> 32 Harry Lourandos et al.

Below this lowermost radiocarbon date, however, the SU3 sediments themselves are  of very compact mottled clays, with small manganese nodules that appear to pre-date human  occupation. Radiocarbon dates were obtained from every three or so XU above XU60, sometimes  more frequently. They appear to progress at a fairly regular sedimentation rate of about 0.10  cm/100 years from ca. 30,000 BP in XU60 to 13,900 BP in XU52 (see Table 3). After this  time, sedimentation rates increase two- to three-fold, to 0.26 cm/100 years, until ca. 3000 BP  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="10"> 34 Harry Lourandos et al. Table 1.

Sediments are homogeneous throughout. Sediments are very ashy and cultural in origin. They are discon- tinuous across the four squares, being present only in the NW part  of the excavation, immediately below SU1b but with a slightly  10YR6/2 1c greater spatial spread.

SU1p is very ashy and  fine-grained in texture. An uneven unit consisting of well-defined patches of white ash in- terspersed among brown sediments reminiscent of SU1p and SU1r.  SU1q is here treated as a single SU with patches of ash constrained  within the limits of this SU. SU1q is interpreted as a hearth whose  patches of ash have been intermixed (probably largely during  10YR5/3 to 10YR8/1  1q hearth construction and use), with sediments of SU1p and SU1r 8.5 Brown to white  character. Note that both the white and brown components of  SU1q are ashy. While the boundaries of SU1q are ill-defined, in  the sense that the patches of ash appear interspersed among the  brown sediments, the overall area where the ash occurs is very  well-defined.  Ashy silt whose boundary with overlying SU1p is gradual and oc- curs over ca. 5 cm. The boundary with underlying SU2a occurs over  10YR5/3-10YR5/4 1r 2 cm. Sediments in SU1r are noticeably less ashy and more brown 8.5 Brown to yellowish brown than those above. They are also noticeably more compact and  slightly more humid. Slightly moist clayey silt, rich in calcium carbonate concretions.  10YR3/4-10YR4/4 2a This SU represents a major stratigraphic break from overlying SUs. 8.5 Dark yellowish brown The boundary with underlying SU2b is ill-defined.  Sediments are similar to those of SU2a, but boundaries with sur- rounding SUs are less well-defined but still occur over some 2 cm  10YR4/4 2b of depth. The major difference from SU2a is that SU2b contains 8.5 Dark yellowish brown lower concentrations of calcium carbonate concretions. Sediments  are fine, clayey silt, somewhat moist. Silty clay. Sediments are moist and become more clayey with  depth. They are relatively homogeneous throughout the pit, and  some calcium carbonate concretions occur throughout.

There is a large root which grows at the interface  of SU2c and SU3. This is the lowermost SU excavated, and appeared to be culturally  sterile at the time of excavation (i.e. no cultural materials were  noticed in situ). It consists of clayey matrix with large amounts  of small manganese nodules (&lt;1 cm in diameter). Sediments are  7.5YR5/6-10YR4/6 3 mottled and extremely compact. In the western part of the pit, 8.5 Strong brown to dark yellowish brown sediments are mottled whitish, but this is less apparent in the  eastern part of the pit. Sediments in SU3 were very difficult to dig  due to their high moisture content and their very compact nature.  The interface between SU3 and overlying SU2c is marked. in XU41. Considerable mixing of sediments, however, is apparent from XU43 to XU35 (as is  evident from dating reversals), making it more difficult to interpret average sedimentation rates  on this part of the curve. The past 3000 years BP witnessed a further sustained nine- to 10-fold  increase in sedimentation rates, to an average of 2.53 cm/100 years. The uppermost radiocarbon  dates are consistent with the site finally being used by people around the time of European  arrival in the region during the late 19th century AD. We interpret the zone of dating reversals, most pronounced from 83 cm to 63 cm below  ground (XU43-XU35), in two ways. This zone represents the boundary between SU1 and  SU2 into SU2a and SU2b. Firstly, these levels include the early-Holocene period, a time when  other archaeological sequences in north Queensland are also characterised by dating reversals  and coarser sediments that have been argued by various authors (e.g. David and Chant 1995)  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="14"> 38 Harry Lourandos et al. terra australis 34 YEARS BP 0 2500 5000 7500 10,000 12,500 15,000 17,500 20,000 22,500 25,000 27,500 30,000 #/m2/100yrs g/m2/100yrs g/m2/100yrs g/m2/100yrs g/m2/100yrs g/m2/100yrs g/m2/100yrs g/m2/100yrs Stone aretfacts Charcoal Bone Burnt earth Alectura lathami Mussel shell Land snail CaCO 3  egg shell shell Concretions Figure 6.

Increased humid conditions appear to have damaged this part of the archaeological  assemblage at Hay Cave through migrating driplines and lag or mixed deposits whereby fine  particles, but not the coarse sediment fraction, have been removed (see below). Between XU36  and XU46 sediments are clayey but incorporate large amounts of coarser-grained components,  including peak quantities of land-snail shell and calcium carbonate concretions (Figure 6).  These XUs represent the final period of the Pleistocene to the mid Holocene when rainfall  levels are known to have peaked. The large numbers of land-snail shell and peak frequencies of  calcium-carbonate concretions in these levels include the early Holocene period of heightened  humidity, consistent with both items themselves signalling wetter conditions.  Secondly, the complex of hearths from SU1 (cf. Figure 5) appear to have intruded into and  disturbed underlying stratigraphic levels from earlier periods, such as those of SU2a and SU2b.  SU1 is composed of numerous in situ hearths and hearth material, as well as representing  the period of time when the cave was most intensively used by people and thus suffered the  greatest amount of treadage (see below). Intrusive hearths and related activities, therefore,  can be expected to have caused some disturbance to earlier sediments, including mixing of  small charcoal particles such as those used here in our AMS determinations, particularly at  stratigraphic interfaces representing ancient surfaces.  Palaeoenvironments: Land-snail shells Information on palaeoenvironmental dynamics for the Chillagoe Formation has been  obtained through an examination of the geographical distribution, and ecological and biological  characteristics, of the helicinid terrestrial mollusc shell Pleuropoma extincta (Odhner 1917). The  use of P. extincta remains for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction at Hay Cave is dependent  on two main factors: firstly, the capacity of the species to show a measurable response to  environmental change; and secondly, the ability to recover sufficient undamaged shell material  from the archaeological excavation. Pleuropoma extincta’s current restriction to the vine-thicket communities of the Chillagoe  Formation is indicative of an acute sensitivity to regional and local moisture supply. The species  occurs abundantly both as living populations on the limestone rock and associated vegetation,  and as dead shells in the litter deposits. It has not been recorded from the more expansive  eucalypt forest/woodland communities which dominate much of the region. An analysis of  1140 modern P. extincta shells from 23 collection localities within the Chillagoe Formation  confirmed a sensitivity in shell growth (measured as size-correlated differences in shell whorl  count) to environmental moisture availability. Differences in shell size and pattern between  populations of P. extincta correlate positively with a declining regional north-south gradient in  annual average rainfall and mean number of rain days. Measurements made on shells collected  from the northern Mitchell-Palmer limestone belt are consistently more than those gathered  from the Chillagoe-Mungana limestone belt further south, where the former recorded higher  rainfall statistics than the latter. This apparent variation in the shell size of modern P. extincta  is consistent with findings of environmental moisture-related variation in the shell size of  terrestrial molluscs from the Kimberley in northwestern Australia (Solem and Christensen  1984) and several other detailed studies (e.g. Tillier 1981; Gould 1984) that suggest moisture  is the critical factor in determining size and shape in mollusc species and between populations,  more so than temperature, insolation, population density or the availability of calcium. Full  details of these modern P. extincta investigations have been presented in Rowe (1998) and  Rowe et al. (2001). A total of 295 sub-fossil specimens of P. extincta were recovered from archaeological  excavations at Hay Cave. A high incidence of terrestrial mollusc shell (of all species) by weight  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="18"> 42 Harry Lourandos et al. occurred after ca. 13,600 BP to around or shortly before 3100 BP (XU49-XU38), incorporating  a peak (688.0 g) at XU40. Before this time, total shell incidence is comparatively low. Above  XU38, a pronounced decrease to almost negligible occurrence is evident, encompassing the  period ca. 3100 BP to present. In the excavated P. extincta shells, mean whorl counts, heights  and diameters peak between 13,600 BP and 13,420 BP (XU49-XU45) and all shell parameters  have high values between 13,600 BP and 3100 BP (XU49-XU34), declining after ca. 3100  BP before a secondary peak through the period ca. 820-660 BP (XU12-XU6). Low values  continue to the present. Palaeoenvironmentally, both the incidence of terrestrial mollusc shell and the variation  in P. extincta shell size with depth indicate dry conditions during the late Pleistocene leading  into the terminal Pleistocene/Holocene boundary. This is followed by a period of increased (to  peak) precipitation encompassing the early and mid Holocene, until approximately 3100 BP,  in turn followed by an effective drying. Although dry, the last ca. 3100 years appear to have  incorporated a wetter phase around 820-660 BP, suggesting a degree of local precipitation and  general climatic variability. These major changes in moisture regimes are thought to have affected  the spread, floristic structure and complexity of the vine-thicket communities throughout the  Chillagoe Formation. Vine-thicket communities would have had a maximum distribution  beyond the current confines of the limestone outcrops, displacing areas of sclerophyll vegetation  between ca. 13,600 BP and 3100 BP. A late-Holocene drier climate allowed for a reinvasion  of the sclerophyll vegetation, reducing the P. extincta habitat. The Chillagoe Formation vine  thickets are therefore remnants of a more extensive late-Pleistocene to mid-Holocene flora,  now represented as permanent refugia. The local Chillagoe Formation palaeoenvironmental  results are, overall, consistent with higher rainfall regimes and associated maximum extent  of humid rainforests during the early and mid Holocene on the Queensland east coast, as  informed by palynological data (Kershaw et al. 1993; Kershaw 1994). However, the P. extincta  shell data suggestion of an earlier increase in moisture availability, close to 13,600 BP west of  the Great Dividing Range, warrants further investigation. Palaeotemperatures: Alectura lathami egg shells The chronology of Hay Cave has also been assisted by examination of the remains of  brush-turkey egg shell from its deposits. The extent of isoleucine epimerisation in Australian  brush-turkey (Alectura lathami) egg shell from Hay Cave was reported by Clarke 2005 and  Clarke et al. 2007. Isoleucine epimerisation (a diagenetic reaction analogous to amino acid  racemisation) is the interconversion of the epimers L-isoleucine (Ile) and D-alloisoleucine  (aIle), and is expressed as the ratio of these two molecules (aIle/Ile). In modern Alectura egg  shell the aIle/Ile value is approximately 0.02 and increases towards a value of 1.30 at dynamic  equilibrium. A total of 99 Alectura egg-shell fragments excavated from Square M30 of Hay Cave were  subjected to isoleucine epimerisation analyses. These egg shells primarily come from the upper  75 cm of the sequence; below these depths, egg shell was rare or absent. The values fall into  three main clusters: 0.02 &lt; aIle/Ile &lt; 0.05, 0.05 &lt; aIle/Ile &lt; 0.08, and 0.13 &lt; aIle/Ile &lt; 0.16.  These clusters are identified as A, B and C, respectively. Not incorporated in these three clusters  are the aIle/Ile values of three egg shells, one of which falls between clusters B and C. The  other two have aIle/Ile values greater than those observed in cluster C. The two egg shells with  aIle/Ile values exceeding these ranges are not considered further as they are likely to reflect the  influence of campfire heating on the rate of isoleucine epimerisation (Clarke et al. 2007). The correlation between Alectura egg shell aIle/Ile values and calibrated radiocarbon ages  (median of the 1s range) obtained on the same samples can be approximated using a simple  linear model that estimates that the extent of isoleucine epimerisation increases by 0.020 aIle/ terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="19"> Hay Cave: A 30,000-year cultural sequence from the Mitchell-Palmer limestone zone, north Queensland, Australia 43 Ile units every 1000 years. The root mean square error of this regression predicts that the model  can be used to interpret aIle/Ile in terms of sample age with an uncertainty of approximately ±  470 years (when the average analytical uncertainty of ± 0.005 aIle/Ile units is included). Three groups corresponding to clusters A, B and C are identified in the depth-age profile  of the isoleucine epimerisation ages in the Hay Cave sequence. The implication is that three  major chrono-stratigraphic phases can be identified from these data. The egg shells of cluster  A were recovered from depths close to the surface down to approximately 40 cm and have age  estimates of ca. 0-1500 years. The cluster B egg shells occupied depths between 40 cm and 65 cm  and have ages of ca. 2000-3000 years. The egg shells of cluster C came from sediments at about  65-70 cm depth and have ages of approximately ca. 6000-7000 years. The apparently young egg  shells from clusters A and B found at depths below the above-mentioned respective depths are  explained, along with other radiocarbon dates, as most likely due to one of two possibilities:  either post-depositional contamination through treadage and related activities, or the intrusion  of hearths in the suite of Excavation Units spanning XU35-44, at the stratigraphically indistinct  Pleistocene-Holocene interface (see above).  Archaeological materials: Temporal trends To address questions of temporal trends in cultural activity and intensity of site occupation,  studies have been carried out on the rock art and the main archaeological materials from Square  M30: stone artefacts, animal bone, land-snail shell and brush-turkey egg shell (see Table 4 for a  list of excavated materials by XU). The results of these studies are presented below. Stone artefacts The analysis of the stone artefacts focuses on the question of ‘intensity of site use’ through  time. Holden (1999:31-46) followed the methods of Hiscock (1988:163-228) at Colless  Creek, Mitchell (1988) at Seal Point, and Lamb (1994) at Fern Cave to demonstrate that  discard rates of stone artefacts alone are insufficient measures of ‘intensities of site use’, as other  factors may also critically affect the number of artefacts produced and discarded at a site. These  factors include the manufacturing process (e.g. the use of blade versus non-blade technologies;  bipolar versus freehand flaking techniques; heat treatment), lithic resource manipulation (e.g.  decortication at the quarry versus all stages of core reduction on-site) and taphonomic processes  (e.g. post-depositional heat shatter from adjacent hearths; removal of small artefacts by water  action). A set of appropriate multiple attributes was thus used to investigate these processes at  Hay Cave (see Holden 1999 for a detailed analysis of the Hay Cave stone artefacts). Here we  present a summary of these results. Quantities of stone artefacts from SU2 and SU3 at Hay Cave were too low to conclusively  assess changes in human activity during those periods. Suggestive trends, however, were  apparent. In general, deposition rates of the weight of stone material through the deposit  strongly correlate with those of burnt earth, mussel shell and egg shell (Figure 6). The few stone  artefacts in the lower levels suggest overall low levels of site use between ca. 30,000 BP and  13,600 BP, followed by much reduced numbers or a possible hiatus in occupation during the  early Holocene when the cave might have been too humid for regular occupation, with peak  levels of human activity taking place after ca. 3000 BP and continuing until the near-present.  Holden argued that after ca. 3000 BP, increases in the frequency, length of duration of stay or  number of people using the site (all of which potentially contribute to increased intensities of  site use) boosted the demand on stone, leading to practices aimed at conserving the resource.  For example, during the late Holocene, an emphasis was placed on later stages of reduction,  with high levels of controlled flaking, along with increased lithic discard rates. Fluctuations  in lithic deposition rates appear to be unrelated to differential activity locations, raw-material  selection or taphonomic processes, and are thus largely explained by changing intensities of site  use by people (Figure 6; see Holden 1999 for specific details). terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="20"> 44 Harry Lourandos et al. terra australis 34 Table 4.

Because of the large quantities of bone present, the bones were identified from every third XU  down to XU57, below which every XU was analysed for taxonomic identifications. For analytical  purposes, Roche divided the excavated sequence into arbitrary units, each representing a period  of approximately 3000 years (Analytical Units 1-5, excluding Analytical Unit 2a, which is added  here for the purposes of this paper). The Analytical Units followed the timeframes below, and  were based on extrapolation from the depth-age curve (Hughes and Djohadze 1980): Analytical Unit 1: [XU1-34, representing 150 BP to 3000 BP] Analytical Unit 2a: [XU35 to 40, representing 3000 BP to 12,000 BP] Analytical Unit 2b: [XU41-52, representing 12,000 BP to 15,000 BP] Analytical Unit 3: [XU53-56, representing 16,000 BP to 19,500 BP] Analytical Unit 4: [XU57-59, representing 23,500 BP to 27,000 BP] Analytical Unit 5: [XU60-63, representing 29,500 BP to 32,000 BP] These Analytical Units are distinct from the SUs and XUs that structured the excavation  itself, and were employed to facilitate examination of temporal trends through the use of  chronological units of roughly equal, and therefore more comparable, duration. The identifiable  bone was analysed by Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI), and the unidentified,  fragmented bone by the Number of Identified Specimens (NISP) (cf. Grayson 1984:28, 30;  Lyman 1994:98, 100). Bone deposition rates (Figure 6) conform to the general trends observable  in other cultural indices, except that high levels also occur between ca. 32,000 BP and 18,000  BP when other indices are low; and levels increase markedly between ca. 15,000 BP and 12,500  BP. Bone, therefore, appears prominent in the lower and middle units (Anaytical Units 5, 4, 2).  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="24"> 48 Harry Lourandos et al. 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46 49 52 55 58 59 60 61 62 63 Excavation Unit 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Analytical Unit 1: Analytical Unit 2: Analytical Unit 3: Analytical Unit 4: Analytical Unit 5:  (150-3000 BP)  (3000-15,000 BP)  (16,000-19,500 BP)  (23,500-27,000 BP)  (29,500-32,000 BP) Figure 7. Distribution of murid bones by XU (top) and by Analytical Unit (bottom), Square M30. As soil pH remained constant throughout the deposit, general variations in quantities of bone  over time are not related to changes in the acidity of the matrix. There is a generally high rate  of post-cranial fragmentation throughout (more than 90% of the fragments are smaller than  15 mm); frequencies of skeletal elements revealed little variation between XU, with limb bones  being the most common post-cranial bones. All calculations in this analysis were adjusted for  temporal variation between XUs. Calcined and carbonised bones are present in almost all XUs  and highest between XU34-28 and XU52-46. That is, burned bone is most evident between  ca. 3000-2500 BP and ca. 15,000-13,500 BP, which we argue represents those levels when  the site was most heavily used by people. The presence of burnt bone in Hay Cave cannot  be attributed to natural (bush) fires due to its protected location inside a cave which is itself  surrounded by fire-protected limestone pediments; furthermore, the presence of calcined bone  is generally understood to be closely related to human activity (e.g. Shipman et al. 1984:323;  David 1990:75).  Taxonomic identifications were undertaken on teeth and jaws, indicating the presence  of 24 distinct species plus five indeterminate family- or genus-level taxa which could not be  attributed to species (Table 5). Macropod bones are present in almost all XUs, with NISP peak  deposition periods in XU34-25 (the lower part of Analytical Unit 1) and XU52-43 (Analytical  Unit 2b) – that is, between ca. 3000 BP and 2500 BP and between ca. 15,000 BP and 13,500  BP. Macropod MNI are highest in Analytical Unit 1 (ca. 3000 BP and 150 BP)(Table 6). terra australis 34 Number of Identified Specimens Number of Identified Specimens </page> <page sequence="25"> Hay Cave: A 30,000-year cultural sequence from the Mitchell-Palmer limestone zone, north Queensland, Australia 49 Table 6. Description of Analytical Units (see Roche 1999:101-11 for further details). Analytical  Years BP Description Unit This unit contains the fastest sedimentation rates, peak proportions of macropods, and the  second-highest value of calcined bone. There is also evidence for the rationing and conservation  of stone (Holden 1999:96), indicating that demands on lithic raw materials were high. All of the  dated rock art belongs to this time. The complete absence of grassland faunal taxa (with murid  NISP at their lowest) cannot be related to differential environmental or climatic conditions.  1 150-3000 Rather, people, with their high incidence of hearths, are inversely correlated with the frequency  of murids at this time (and, by implication, probably also the use of the cave by predatory birds).  Forest faunal taxa also show a marginal decrease from the prior wetter period (of the early to  mid Holocene represented by Analytical Unit 2a). Lower precipitation during Analytical Unit 1 is  also reflected in low deposition rates of land-snail shell and calcium-carbonate concretions (cf.  Rowe 1998:78-79). Between ca. 3000 BP and 13,500 BP, land-snail shell and calcium-carbonate deposits increased  noticeably, indicating peak levels of precipitation (Rowe 1998:78-79). The period between  3000 BP and 12,000 BP is not clearly differentiated at Hay Cave, partly due to the presence of  2a 3000-12,000 mixed sediments during this period, the coarser nature of those sediments (indicating that finer  sediments may have been washed away through percolating water action), and the cementing  of sediments in calcium-carbonate concretions. Human use of the site is less than during the late Holocene, but higher than preceding Analytical  Units, with high weights of calcined bone and other indices. Murids and macropods are also  12,000- abundant, with peak incidence of open forest/woodland taxa. Grassland taxa, however, are little  2b 15,000 different in proportion to those of Analytical Units 4 and 5, indicating that grasslands were not  expansive at this time. During this time, the increased use of the site by people and other fauna,  including murid predators, is related to higher levels of precipitation than previously. Human use was marginally more than during the preceding Analytical Unit 4. Here, there is also  a low level of murids, and the second-lowest weight of calcined bone, murid and macropod  16,000- 3 NISP. Climatic conditions were dry, as indicated by low levels of land-snail shell and calcium- 19,500 carbonate concretions. Low levels also of open forest/woodland animals are consistent with drier  environmental conditions and a reduction in forests. A relatively low level of human use is shown by average levels of calcined bone and macropods,  23,500- 4 and low levels of flaked stone and burnt earth. There is a high proportion of murids, indicating  27,000 that animals and probably predatory birds were frequent users of the cave. A low level of human use is indicated by the low amount of calcined bone, the slow rate of  29,500- 5 sedimentation, and the lowest values of macropods contrasting with the highest proportions of  32,000 murids. Greater amounts of macropod than murid bone at a site are usually suggestive of people  rather than other predators, even though the diets of people and animal predators may overlap  to some extent (Balme et al. 1978:52; Bowdler 1984:63; David 1984b:40). Macropods form a  key element of human diets, while murids are more prominent in the diets of other predators,  such as birds using caves as roosts. More intensive human use of a cave or rockshelter, therefore,  often results in a decline in murid bones due to the presence of hearths and other disturbances  to the lair or roost of non-human predators (David 1984a:49). As rates of bone fragmentation  remained constant throughout the Hay Cave sequence, differential bone preservation does  not appear to account for the changes in the absolute or relative representation of macropods  and murids. Frequencies of murid bones can thus be contrasted with frequencies of culturally  deposited bones (in particular, macropod) within the deposit. Accordingly, and in contrast with  the pattern of macropod bone at Hay Cave, murid NISP are almost totally absent in Analytical  Unit 1 when human activity is most prominent (murid bones are absent in XU31-1, except  for XU13). They are present in all other Analytical Units, with a peak presence in Analytical  Units 4 and 5 (Figure 7). Comparison between Analytical Units 1 and 5, representing the two  extremes of highest and lowest human occupation respectively, indicates a marked negative  correlation between murid and macropod bone concentrations; when murid concentrations  are high, macropod are low, and vice versa. In line with previous studies, such as at Walkunder  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="26"> 50 Harry Lourandos et al. Figure 8. Panel of pigment anthropomorphs, including the two radiocarbon-dated pictures, Hay Cave. Arch Cave also in the Chillagoe Formation, the implication is that the human use of Hay Cave  is significantly greatest during the last ca. 3000 years in Analytical Unit 1 (Roche 1999:80-92). The frequency of open forest/woodland taxa, as measured by NISP/1000 years, indicates  their presence throughout the deposit, with very low frequencies in Analytical Unit 3 (the  Last Glacial Maximum) and peak frequencies in Analytical Unit 2 (terminal Pleistocene). This  may be an indication of a climatic gradient from maximum aridity to increasing humidity, and  therefore a decline in open forest/woodland during the drier Last Glacial Maximum followed  by an increase during the more humid terminal Pleistocene into the early Holocene. However,  the complete absence of grassland taxa (for example, murids) in Analytical Units 1 and 3 may  be related to the increased presence of humans during the late Holocene and possibly the Last  Glacial Maximum also. As Analytical Unit 3 represents the glacial maximum – a time of peak  aridity when grasslands were more dominant – the results in this case are somewhat ambiguous  and may be interpreted either as evidence of changed environmental conditions and/or as a  period of increased human presence (Roche 1999:92-100). If we summarise the data regarding people’s activities at Hay Cave, comparing vertebrate  faunal evidence with the deposition rates of other cultural materials and with the speed of  sediment accumulation through time, peak rates of use by people consistently occur during the  late Holocene (especially the past ca. 3000 years in Analytical Unit 1), followed by Analytical  Unit 2b (the terminal Pleistocene, ca. 15,000 BP to 12,000 BP), with Analytical Units 3, 4 and  5 showing sequentially decreasing levels.  The rock art Hay Cave contains 92 rock pictures, all but four of which are either drawn (mainly in black  charcoal) or painted. The drawn and painted art is from here on referred to as ‘pigment art’.  The other four rock pictures are moderately patinated engravings pecked into the rock wall.  Appendix 1 lists each of these rock pictures. Four radiocarbon determinations were obtained from small scrapings of charcoal pigment  art. Two of these are from generalised anthropomorphs located on a small panel near the cave  entrance, but well inside the dripline (Figure 8). This decorated panel is found high up on the  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="27"> Hay Cave: A 30,000-year cultural sequence from the Mitchell-Palmer limestone zone, north Queensland, Australia 51 overhanging rock wall, in a part of the cave that could only be accessed by artists when standing  on a large boulder on the scree slope and reaching up. This localised panel is segregated spatially  from the main body of artwork in the cave, marking the cave entrance, and the charcoal drawings  found here would appear, on both spatial and stylistic grounds, to represent a single artistic  event. The two radiocarbon-dated charcoal drawings from this panel are part of a spatially  and stylistically close-knit set of ‘Generalised Anthropomorphs’ and ‘Anthropomorphs with  Inverted V-Headdresses’ (see David et al. 1997 for details of the Mitchell-Palmer region’s  rock art). About 1 m away around the corner of the same rock that protrudes down from  the ceiling, an ‘Anthropomorph with Knobbed Headdress’, drawn in a similar manner to the  other two radiocarbon-dated anthropomorphs, was also radiocarbon dated. Each of these three  radiocarbon determinations overlaps at two standard deviations, and indicates that this panel  and the nearby paintings were probably all drawn around 1500 BP. The fourth radiocarbon-dated rock drawing is located in a protected part of the site in  semi-dark conditions on the vertical wall of a large limestone pillar close to the back wall. It  consists of a set of ‘Radiating Lines’ (see David et al. 2001:112 for a tracing of this drawing).  The radiocarbon date for this image is 1010 ± 60 BP (OZC608). The two major implications from the radiocarbon dates at Hay Cave are that, firstly, artistic  activity took place late during the late Holocene, during a span of time when cultural activity  (including the application of pigment art on rock) and demographic conditions appear to have  reached a peak across much of north Queensland (see David and Chant 1995). And, secondly,  that the artistic activity at Hay Cave took place at a point in time with no in-situ evidence of  human presence in that part of the site we have excavated. For example, even when the out- of-sequence 14C sample OZD010 is taken into account, there appears to be an absence of  sedimentation and cultural deposition between ca. 1500 BP and 1000 BP. Therefore, it could  be argued that at that time the cultural significance of the site shifted, the cave being no  longer suitable for habitation, rather being reserved for artistic practices and their symbolic and  cosmological associations. Discussion Palaeoenvironmental trends at Hay Cave Based on the incidence of grassland and open forest/woodland animal taxa, Roche  (1999:111-13) concluded that gross vegetation patterns in the Hay Cave area remained  generally stable through time (relative to more coastal parts of southeast Cape York Peninsula).  That is, throughout the past 30,000 years, the Hay Cave environment retained its patchwork of  open forest/woodland and grassland with small pockets of wet forest vegetation amongst the  karst towers. Nevertheless, some changes did take place. Between ca. 19,000 BP and 16,000 BP, low  proportions of open forest/woodland animal taxa indicate more arid conditions than previously,  but less dramatic changes than have been described for the Atherton Tableland some 150 km to  the southeast (cf. Butler 1998:5; Kershaw 1986:48). This drier period is followed by an increase in  open forest/woodland animal taxa between ca. 15,000 BP and 12,000 BP, suggesting increasing  precipitation (Roche 1999). Rowe’s (1998) complementary land-snail shell and calcium- carbonate concretion data also indicate dry conditions leading into the terminal Pleistocene/ Holocene boundary, followed by a period of increased-to-peak precipitation encompassing the  early and mid Holocene ca. 13,600-3100 BP. Peak humid conditions during this time began  shortly after ca. 13,600-13,420 BP. The sediments of the mid-Holocene period at Hay Cave  include the phase ca. 7000-6000 BP, as indicated by the Australian brush-turkey (Alectura  lathami) egg-shell cluster C. terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="28"> 52 Harry Lourandos et al. At Hay Cave, the onset of increased precipitation (and end of peak aridity) in the terminal  Pleistocene (between ca. 15,000 BP and 12,000 BP) generally overlaps in timing with that  of other parts of southeast Cape York Peninsula ca. 13,000-10,000 BP (Torgensen et al.  1988:259), although its commencement at Hay Cave may be slightly earlier. The analysis of  land-snail shell (Rowe 1998) present throughout the Hay Cave sequence, indicates an unbroken  association with vine thicket. While the karst formations may have acted as refugia for such  relatively humid forest vegetation, low quantities of rainforest/wet forest vertebrate taxa at the  site suggest that humid forest or vine thicket itself was never expansive across the region during  the past 30,000 years. Here, relatively wet forest/vine thicket may have been restricted mainly  to small refugia like the karsts and creek edges, even during the wetter terminal-Pleistocene to  mid-Holocene period.  The past ca. 3000 years, by way of contrast, were generally drier, with Rowe’s land-snail  shell data indicating that a short wetter phase occurred also between ca. 900 BP and 600 BP,  suggesting overall general climatic variability. Open forest/woodland vertebrate taxa accordingly  show a marginal decrease from the prior wetter period of the early to mid Holocene.  Cultural trends at Hay Cave Drawing all the material together, we have the following sequence. People first started using  Hay Cave around 30,000 BP or shortly beforehand, but at first, human occupation was low. The  following, increasingly drier, periods that led into the glacial maximum (ca. 19,500-16,000 BP),  continued to experience low levels of site use by people. Murids are absent during this phase  of peak aridity. Throughout this long period of time, the cave was occupied more frequently  by animals, including predatory birds. These trends were measured by the various indices –  deposition rates of sediment, animal bone, mussel shell and egg shell; and construction rates  of hearths, incorporating charcoal, burnt earth and structural features. These indicate that low  levels of site use continued until around 15,000 BP when evidence of human presence begins  to increase. This was a time of open forest/woodland and grassland communities. The first noticeable long-term rise in occupation by people coincided with increasing rates  of precipitation between ca. 15,000 BP and 12,000 BP that continued into the early to mid  Holocene until around 3100 BP. With the onset of increasing precipitation at this time, people  began to use the cave more often and there is a peak in the incidence of open forest/woodland  animal taxa. Murids also are present, indicating a continuation of mixed human and non- human use of the cave. Patterns of human occupation at the site are unclear to some extent during the early to mid  Holocene due to stratigraphic disturbances. The significant rise in levels of precipitation between  ca. 13,600 BP and 3100 BP (Rowe 1998:78-79) may have resulted in disturbance to the cave’s  deposits, as indicated by larger sediment particle sizes and high quantities of calcium-carbonate  concretions, together with increases in land-snail shell. To what extent people continued using  the cave throughout this lengthy period is uncertain, although the presence of cultural remains  in those deposits (often encrusted in thick calcium-carbonate concretions) testifies against total  abandonment. During this period, radiocarbon dates on charcoal and egg shell at Hay Cave,  and chronological estimates based on degrees of isoleucine epimerisation among Australian  brush-turkey egg shells, point to depositional events around 12,000 BP, between 7000-6000  BP and around 5400 BP. The most intensive period of occupation of the cave was during the late Holocene, between  ca. 3100 BP until the near-present, a period of drier, changeable climate. This peak period of  human use of Hay Cave between ca. 3000 BP and 150 BP is shown by all indices, including the  fastest deposition rates of sediments, and also of a broad class of cultural materials, including  peak proportions of macropod bone and high calcined bone frequencies. Attempts were made  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="29"> Hay Cave: A 30,000-year cultural sequence from the Mitchell-Palmer limestone zone, north Queensland, Australia 53 during this time to ration and conserve stone, indicating that demands for lithic raw materials  were high relative to availability. The decline in murids may also be linked to increased human  presence. Indeed, murids are only present in XU13, coinciding with a short wet phase dated to  within ca. 900-600 BP, suggesting that wetter conditions may have then limited people’s use of  the damp cave, leaving it to other predators including birds. There is no strong evidence here to  link murids predominantly to human diet. It is during this recent period also that rock art – in particular pigment art – makes its  appearance. Around 1500 BP, artists began to use the site in a new way, and in doing so, ceased  to live in it – or at least in the area we excavated, using it instead in a specialised way. The  symbolic marking of the cave with charcoal anthropomorphs at its entrance, and a broader  range of designs within its chambers, signals the onset of a new system of territorial place  marking and cosmological referencing that point to a changing social world. Regional trends and patterns of site use General comparisons can be drawn between the chronological trends observable at Hay  Cave and trends derived from regional archaeological data. Long-term trends for southeast  Cape York Peninsula have been obtained in three ways by analysing temporal patterning in (a)  all radiocarbon dates, (b) the number of occupied sites, and (c) the rates of site establishment,  at a regional scale and over a 30,000-year period (David and Lourandos 1997; Lourandos  and David 1998, 2002). While accepting the generalised nature of all these trends and their  methodological limitations, they nevertheless offer the opportunity to draw comparisons  between different kinds of data sets and between data derived at different analytical scales: in  this case, comparing site trends with regional trends.  A general comparison between the Hay Cave trends and the regional trends shows some  strong similarities. In both, rates of site and regional land use by people are low from before  30,000 BP until after the Last Glacial Maximum, with noticeable increases in all indices during  the terminal Pleistocene after ca. 15,000 BP, and with even higher rises in the late Holocene  after ca. 3000 BP until recent times. These trends apply both to highly durable materials such  as stone artefacts and to hard organic items such as animal bones and shell at sites with good  preservation. Similar trends are observed also in other site data, including the incidence of  hearths, evidence for treadage-induced disturbance, and overall sedimentation rates. They also  apply to rock art, which evidences major quantitative increases in pigment art creation (see  below). The general trend, therefore, is consistent across the varied lines of evidence (e.g. stone  artefacts, faunal remains, rock art) and across analytical scales (site and regional). In this context, and at both site and regional scales, the glacial maximum is clearly  associated with changes to environment and site use. There are, however, no signs of disuse or  abandonment of Hay Cave at this time, as occur at some other sites in the region. During the  Last Glacial Maximum, the karst towers may have served as more humid locations, to which  people periodically retreated, within a generally drier landscape. This pattern of increased use  during the Last Glacial Maximum is observable at the sites of Fern Cave, Hearth Cave and  Sandy Creek 1, all located near permanent sources of water (Morwood and Hobbs 1995:180;  David and Lourandos 1997:6). Likewise, Hay Cave lies close to Limestone Creek, assumed to  have been active during the Last Glacial Maximum. The early Holocene period remains less clear to some extent, at both local (Hay Cave) and  regional scales, due to sediments being affected by post-depositional taphonomic factors such  as lag deposits caused by increased precipitation levels in most sites excavated so far. In addition  to Hay Cave, this problem has been documented also at Walkunder Arch Cave (Campbell  1982:65), Green Ant Shelter (Flood and Horsfall 1986:39), Sandy Creek 1 (Morwood and  Hobbs 1995:78) and Fern Cave (David and Chant 1995:401). In contrast to this issue, however,  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="30"> 54 Harry Lourandos et al. the general regional trends for this same early-mid Holocene period indicate significant rises in  site establishment and use (David and Lourandos 1997). The Hay Cave sequence, therefore, appears to reflect the site’s particular location, and  individual characteristics, within the environmentally varied region of southeast Cape York  Peninsula. Throughout its occupational history, the Hay Cave environment appears to have  remained largely a mixture of open forest/woodland and grassland, with small pockets of dry  rainforest vegetation in the immediate vicinity of karst towers. Overall environmental change  during the Last Glacial Maximum, for example, was less marked than has been described for  the Atherton Tableland on the eastern plateau (Kershaw et al. 2007). In general, Hay Cave  reflects a more stable and drier climate when compared with the more humid areas some 150  km further to the southeast, towards the higher parts of the Great Dividing Range and the  coast. Lying within a rain shadow, the Hay Cave area appears to have been shielded from the  more dramatic climatic oscillations experienced in more coastal regions nearby (see also Rowe  1998:78; Roche 1999:115-25). Nevertheless, the Mitchell-Palmer region (including Hay Cave)  witnessed similar directions of environmental change to those further in the east. Regional trends and patterns: Rock art We have elsewhere argued that the past 2000 years in particular saw an increased  regionalisation of social practice across southeast Cape York Peninsula (David and Chant  1995; David and Lourandos 1998, 1999; David 2002). In Princess Charlotte Bay and its  neighbouring Flinders Island group, the late-Holocene art includes numerous figurative  paintings of moths/butterflies and zoomorphs with crescent heads (David and Chant 1995).  Close by to the south, in the Koolburra Plateau, large numbers of paintings of echidna-human  therianthropes predominate (Flood 1987). Across the Kennedy River, just off the eastern edge  of the Koolburra Plateau, the Laura sandstones are richly decorated with a broad range of  anthropomorphs and, to a lesser degree, zoomorphs, many of which are life-sized and contain  elaborate decoration in bichrome or polychrome (e.g. Cole 1992; Morwood and Hobbs 1995).  To the immediate south of the Laura sandstones, in the Mitchell-Palmer limestone belt,  generalised anthropomorphs abound, many painted upside-down (David et al. 1997). To the  south, neighbouring the Mitchell-Palmer limestones, are the Bonney Glen granite boulders,  where again, generalised anthropomorphs and zoomorphs occur (David 1998a). Immediately  to the south of the Mitchell and Walsh Rivers is Ngarrabullgan, a large, cliff-lined mountain  where the art suddenly and dramatically contrasts with that of all its northern neighbours  (David 1998b): here, no more do we find a predominance of figurative paintings of human and  animal shapes. Instead, we find linear abstract designs, such as single and composite lines, circles  and their variants, radiating and grid designs. In the Mungana, Chillagoe, and Almaden areas  on the other side of the Featherbed Ranges and to the immediate southwest of Ngarrabullgan  – in a similar geological setting to the Mitchell-Palmer limestone belt further to the north –  we again find a predominance of abstract linear paintings (e.g. David and David 1988). In the  Davies Creek region on the edge of the rainforest further to the east, there is a predominance  of localised figurative forms in the shape of generalised anthropomorphs with upraised arms  and down-turned legs, in what some authors have described as a ‘dancing’ style (Clegg 1978;  see David and Chant 1995, and David and Lourandos 1998 for reviews of regional rock-art  conventions). There is, therefore, significant late-Holocene regionalism in southeast Cape York  Peninsula’s rock art. During that time, individual sites began to be used in new ways, adding to  our understanding of social process. Socio-territorial changes documented for the region thus  now also appear to be associated with changes in the meaning of specific places. We suggest that  the increased regionalism of the past two millennia took place as territorial constrictions, and  were inscribed by local artistic practices and legitimated by increasingly localised cosmological  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="31"> Hay Cave: A 30,000-year cultural sequence from the Mitchell-Palmer limestone zone, north Queensland, Australia 55 referents to local ancestral spirit beings that came to be known ethnographically as ‘Dreamings’.  These Dreamings became referents to ‘country’; to landscapes populated not only by people but  also ancestors and spirit-forces that gave the land its particular character in language and culture,  as was apparent during the early European contact period. The portrayal of Dreaming beings and  spirit-forces in rock art during the past 1500 years at Hay Cave, and the past 3000-2000 years  across southeast Cape York Peninsula, at a time coincident with significant increases in site and  regional land use, suggests the onset of population increases and social and territorial restructuring  (David and Lourandos 1997, 1998, 1999), in association with a new or transforming cosmology;  akin to that which through time became the ethnographic Dreaming system of this region. The  predominance of anthropomorphs in the rock art of the entire Mitchell-Palmer region is a graphic  articulation of this process of territorial and cosmological regionalisation expressed in site-specific  depictions and use. Conclusions At Hay Cave, long-term archaeological trends have been characterised in a number of ways by  employing a multifarious approach, composed of a range of separate indices and trends. The overall  general archaeological trend is consistent across the varied lines of evidence and across different  analytical scales, both site-specific and regional. At Hay Cave, generalised, long-term archaeological  trends compare favourably with general, regional temporal trends derived from separate data sets.  In both, rates of site and regional land use by people are low from before ca. 30,000 BP until after  the Last Glacial Maximum, with noticeable increases in all indices during the terminal Pleistocene  after ca. 15,000 BP, and with even higher rises in the late Holocene after ca. 3000 BP until recent  times. At Hay Cave, palaeoenvironmental trends were analysed by use of the land-snail shells and  vertebrate faunal material and these also reflected the wider, general regional trends, while at the  same time presenting a more localised focus. Lying further inland, Hay Cave falls outside the more  humid coastal belt and its more dramatic climatic oscillations. The broader relationships between the  long-term, regional palaeoenvironmental trends and cultural patterns, as well as human demographic  trends, have been discussed elsewhere (cf. David and Lourandos 1997, 1998, 1999; Lourandos  and David 2002). At Hay Cave, the rock art, for example, is clearly a local manifestation of the  regionalised rock-art patterns of the past 2000 years found across the wider Cape York Peninsula  area that have been viewed in terms of increased and denser Aboriginal populations (David and  Lourandos 1998). In all, these spatio-temporal patterns of human behaviour observed through the  analysis of individual sites and their broader regional patterning – incorporating emplaced art and  deposition rates of varied cultural materials – amount to a spatial history of Aboriginal Australia.
