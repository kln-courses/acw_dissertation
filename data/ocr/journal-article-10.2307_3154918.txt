Ursachen, Teilnehmer und Verlauf des Absolom'schen Aufstandes. Berlin: Trowitsch und Sohn, 1909. vii+I138 pages. M. 4.50. This study sets forth fully and carefully the various causes contributing to the outbreak of the revolt under Absalom. Its origins are traced back to the circumstances attending the founding of the monarchy. Caspari points out clearly the indisputable fact that the monarchy was not universally acceptable to the Israelites. The establish- ment and growth of the monarch's influence and power inevitably ran counter to the ambitions and wishes of many of the most influential citizens. Saul had failed to rally all interests around the throne and David's course was beset with most serious obstacles. Absalom was to a large extent only the tool of the disaffected interests in Israel. From this point of view the task of David assumes far greater proportions and the strength of his personality appears conspicuous. The study is well conceived and worked out and furnishes a fine precedent for similar detailed investigations of other periods of Hebrew history. SCHNEIDER, H. Zwei Aufsiitze zur Religionsgeschichte Vorderasiens: Die Entwickelung der Jahureligion und der Mosesagen in Israel und Juda; Die Entwickelung des Gilgameschepos. Mit zwei Abbildungen. [Leipziger Semitistische Studien, V, i.] Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1909. 84 pages. M. I.80. Rarely can so many startling statements be found within forty pages as are furnished by the first of these two studies. Only a few of them may be cited here: Israel's Egyptian oppression was endured, not in Egypt, but in Palestine, and the line on the Merneptah-stele is the proof of it. Israel and Judah had originally nothing whatever to do one with another; they entered Canaan in entire independence of each other. The tribe of Judah and the Aramaic tribe Ja'udi were originally identical and both worshiped the god Jahu after whom they were named. This god Jahu originally was represented in the form of a serpent; hence the bronze serpent which was not destroyed till Hezekiah's time. Later the serpent form gave way to a human figure which con- tinued in the temple until the fall of Jerusalem in 586 B. c. Moses is throughout a mythical figure; his work, his life, his very name are unhistorical. The evidence furnished for these and other similar propositions is very slight and far from convincing to a historian. But the author promises us a larger work in which he will substantiate these positions. Meantime we must possess our souls in patience. The second study devotes itself to the history of the growth of the Gilgamesh epic, tracing it from its earliest discoverable form through all the succeeding stages. Students of Babylonian literature and religion will find this discussion of value. MERX, A. Der Messias oder Ta'eb der Samaritaner, nach bisher unbekanntern Quellen. Mit einem Gedichtniswort von K.

The facts of his career with an appreciation of his work and character are given by Professor Marti. The "sources" of this Samaritan teaching regarding the Messiah are not so wholly unknown as the title claims. The most valuable of the documents here published, translated, and commented upon was translated in an article on "The Messianic Hope of the Samaritans" which appeared in The Open Court for May and September, 1907. Nevertheless, the text itself is made accessible to scholars here and provided with a scholarly setting of interpretative and historical materials. The study forms a valuable contribution to our knowledge of the Samaritan community with its beliefs and hopes. KROPAT, AiNro. Die Syntax des Autors der Chronik verglichen mit der seiner Quellen. Ein Beitrag zur historischen Syntax des Hebritischen. [Beihefte zur Zeitschrift fir die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, XVI.] Giessen: Tapelmann, 1909. viii+94 pages. M. 4. This is the same sort of a study as that of A. Barta, "The Syntax of the Sentence in Isaiah 40-66" (American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures, Vol. XVII [I90oI], pp. 22 ft.), and Miss R. Corwin's The Verb and the Sentence in Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah (1909), both of them Doctor's theses from the Semitic Department of the University of Chicago. Miss Corwin's thesis, as will appear from the title, covers largely the same ground as that of Kropat. The two studies supplement one another admirably; Kropat covers a wider range of syntax, but Corwin works out her narrower theme more thoroughly. Many studies of this sort should be carried through; on the basis of them it will be possible to write a historical syntax of the Hebrew language, a work needing greatly to be done. Hnrscwv, N. C. Artaxerxes III Ochus and His Reign, with Special Considera- tion of the Old Testament Sources Bearing upon the Period. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1909. v+85 pages. $o.8i. This is a Doctor's dissertation worked out in the University at Bern under the guidance of Professor Karl Marti. It comprises three chapters, the first giving a rapid survey of the entire period of Persian history, the second making a special study of the reign of Ochus, and the third endeavoring to make a strong case in favor of dating several sections of the Old Testament in the reign of Ochus. This third chapter constitutes nearly one-half of the book. The author places Isa. 19: I-I5; 23: I-14; 56- 66; Pss. 44, 74, 79, and 83 in the reign of Ochus, and finds reflections of the campaigns of Ochus in Palestine embodied in Isa. 14: 28-32, though the passage itself is from a later time. The thesis displays a wide acquaintance with the literature concerning this period and will thus be of use to students of the Persian age because of its bibliog- raphy and its full citation of sources. There is gathered together here all the informa- tion accessible regarding Ochus and his reign, and care has been taken to render it reliable--yet, one wonders how Atossa could have been both mother and sister of Ochus (p. 26). Was not Statira his mother ? The discussion of Old Testament passages adds little to our knowledge as to their origin; but not much can be expected along this line in the case of materials such as those in question, where the external evidence is lacking and the internal proofs are somewhat elusive.</page><page sequence="3">BRIEF MENTION I155 NEW TESTAMENT AND PATRISTICS PELEIDERER, OTTO. Primitive Christianity, Its Writings and Teachings in Their Historical Connections. Translated by W. Montgomery. Vol. II. New York: Putnam, 1909. 510 pages. $3.00. The second volume of Mr. Montgomery's excellent translation of the late Pro- fessor Pfleiderer's Urchristentum covers the Synoptic Gospels and the Acts, together with the Preaching of Jesus and the Faith of the First Disciples. Professor Pfleiderer's views are too well known from the German edition to call for extended presentation. The use of Lukan materials in the Third Gospel and the Acts gave them the name of Luke. They show the influence of Josephus and belong to the beginning of the second century. Pfleiderer finds the sources of the early narratives of Acts in oral tradition rather than in specific documents. Mark wrote the gospel which bears his name, probably within the decade following the fall of Jerusalem. It was the approaching reign of God (Gottesherrschaft) which was so potently proclaimed by Jesus. Certainly "messianic ideas strongly influenced" his mind in "the last days at Jerusalem," and the words and acts of that time must be understood in the light of those ideas (p. 467). While Professor Pfleiderer's rigorous method sometimes results in views that are undoubtedly extreme, his independence and vigor give his work great value for all serious workers in the New Testament. The indices are postponed to a later volume. 5Suov vlbv dzvOpduov is a curious misprint (p. 478); cf. Rev. 1:13; 14:14. SCHERMANN, THEODOR. Griechische Zauberpapyri und das Gemeinde- und Dankgebet im I Klemensbriefe. [Texte und Untersuchungen, XXXIV, 2. b.] Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1909. 64 pages. M. 2. This comparative study of the language of the prayers in FirSt Clement and in the magical papyri shows the large indebtedness of both to Jewish literature, and also the relationship existing between Christian and pagan religious expression. Schermann has not covered all the magical papyri in his survey. Oxyrhynchus 924, a gnostic charm which speaks of Jesus Christ and the Living God, might well have been included and would have modified the statement (p. 3) that but one magical papyrus of the fourth century seems to be of Christian origin. Tebtunis 275 might also have been noticed. Indeed, Schermann seems to know Grenfell's work only when Wessely has republished it. If the statement (p. 24) that in a Christian letter of 250-285 A. D. the Pope's entourage is already described as ol KaT' adrt' dyt Taro&amp;L 1apeO.T ES refers to the Amherst letter (Amherst Papyri, I, pp. 28-30)--Schermann gives no reference for it- the reading is unsupported by the editors of that papyrus; cf.

Liitgert follows his study of the Corinthian errorists (Freiheitspredigt und Schwarm- geister in Korinth, 1908) with an investigation of those opposed in the pastoral epistles. While he accepts these epistles as Paul's, his discussion is not controlled by that view, but proceeds independently of it. The errorists attacked in the pastorals were Jewish Antinomianists who had been drawn into the church by its teaching of freedom from the Law. By reason of their spiritual gifts they claimed independence from church</page><page sequence="4">156 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY authority. They practiced asceticism in matters of sex, and held to a dualistic view of the world. They thus present important resemblances to the Corinthian errorists, but the latter were libertinists, while they were ascetics. BACON, B. W. Commentary on the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians. [The Bible for Home and School.] New York: Macmillan, 1909. vii+135 pages. 50 cents net. Professor Bacon holds Galatians to be the earliest of Paul's extant letters, assigning it to a time in the first visit to Corinth, somewhat earlier than that of the Thessalonian letters. He argues convincingly for the South Galatian destination of the letter, and discusses at length its relation to the narrative of Acts. The commentary is learned, vigorous, and stimulating. Yet it is not easy for a scholar of Bacon's technical equip- ment to write in a clear, popular way. SCHLATTER, A. Die Theologie des Neuen Tesktaments und die Dogmatik. Giiters- loh: Bertelsmann, 1909. 82 pages. M. I.50. Less attention is given to determining the contribution which New Testament theology makes to "dogmatics" than to expounding the proper method of New Testa- ment theological study. The fundamental contention is that it should not be dogmatic but historical, and there should be not only a statistical collection of early Christian thought but a recognition of motive and tendency in the formulation of that thought. Mere speculation in theology, apart from some basis in fact, is deplored; and the basal facts, it is held, lie not only in present experience but also in the religious convictions of the early Christians. It is necessary to understand the concrete individual character of the primitive faith in order to correct the dogmatist's inclination to use the New Testament language as though it was written for the special purpose of furnishing mod- erns with materials for idealizing theological abstractions. The aim of New Testa- ment theology is not to construct a dogmatic system but to perceive the content of the early religion, the believers' fundamental convictions about God's sovereignty, Christ, sin, justification, love, faith. Naturally we ask, To what extent will such study serve the needs of the systematic theologian ? If the author would grant that the theologian's chief duty is to interpret religious experience, both past and present, nothing more need be said; but if he would hold that these original Christian "convictions" are in some way normative for modern theology there is still the serious question of how their authoritativeness is to be deter- mined. It may be true that their effect upon the lives of the early believers proves the genuine character of the convictions (p. 78), but it does not necessarily follow that one's life today must be controlled by the same convictions in order to be effective. To reason thus would be to repeat the fallacy of the "undistributed middle." CALLAUD, PIERRE. Le problame de la rpisurrection du Christ: Etude des diverses hypotheses. Paris: Nourry, 1909. 158 pages. Fr. 2.50. Two items in the tradition of Jesus' resurrection are regarded as authentically attested: the tomb had been found empty, and Jesus had been seen by the disciples. How are these two facts to be explained? The author answers, Jesus had only swooned, but the onlookers mistook him for dead. Later he revived, left the tomb, and permitted his disciples to see him on a few occasions. This theory is today generally thought to involve insuperable difficulties, especially from the moral stand- point. The present work cannot be said to have removed these difficulties.</page><page sequence="5">BRIEF MENTION 157 ROBERTSON, A. T. Epochs in the Life of Paul: A Study of Development in Paul's Career. New York: Scribner, 190go9. xi+337pages. $1.25. The story of Paul's life is here cursorily outlined from the traditional standpoint. Certain important critical discussions are avoided, although the writer claims to present the results of criticism. The presentation thus seems to be made upon the rejection rather than upon the solution of important critical problems. There is no evidence of a critical use of the sources of information, and the possibility of any divergence in point of view between the letters of Paul and the Book of Acts does not seem to be recog- nized. Consequently some of the most important questions which the serious student of Paul and Paulinism is asking today, e. g., What was Paul's relation to the Jews on gentile soil ? Was he the first to take up gentile missionary work ? What is his relation to the founding of Christianity ? are not satisfactorily treated. WORSLEY, F. W. The Fourth Gospel and the Synoptists: A Contribution to the Study of the Synoptic Problem. Edinburgh: Clark, 1909. Imported by Scribner. ix+184 pages. $1.25. The author is primarily concerned to show the strictly historical character of the Fourth Gospel. It is thought to have been written by the apostle John, whose object was to supplement and correct the earlier narratives. Hence wherever this gospel varies from the others its account is always the more reliable. The evangelist had no theological bias; his sole motive was to write pure history. Worsley's defense of his position occasionally drops to the plane of special pleading, and in speaking of opposing views he is sometimes almost contemptuous. "Modern Religious Problems." Edited by A.

The Historical and Religious Value of the Fourth Gospel, 1909. 93 pages. $0.50. Bacon notes four items in connection with the founding of the church. Its begin- nings are traced to the brotherhood established about Jesus while on earth; the awaken- ing of Peter's faith in the risen Christ is the second stage; the confession of Jesus as Lord was the early watchword of the common faith; baptism and the breaking of bread were the early outward marks of the new society. Much significance is attached to Peter as the "founder." Scott's views on the Fourth Gospel are already known to readers of his earlier work on the subject. Here he presents with clearness and in popular fashion the results of a sane, critical study of the book, showing the character of its content, the place it filled in early Christian thought, and its permanent value. PICK, BERNHARD. The Apocryphal Acts of Paul, Peter, John, Andrew, and Thomas. Chicago: The Open Court Publishing Co., 1909. xvi+376 pages. $1.25. Dr. Pick follows his useful collection of early gospels and sayings of Jesus (Para- lipomena) with a similar volume of translations of the early apocryphal Acts, in the study of which so much progress has recently been made through the discoveries of Schmidt and the labors of Bonnet and others. The resulting texts and studies have been freely used by Dr. Pick in making his translations of considerable parts of these</page><page sequence="6">158 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OR THEOLOGY earliest Acts. He considers these representative of the Christianity of the late second century, dating the Acts of John between 150 and 180 and the Acts of Paul before 200. Dr. Pick seems to concur in Schmidt's dating of the Acts of Peter early in the third century, but suggests no specific dates for the Acts of Andrew or of Thomas. It is probable that they too belong to the end of the second or the beginning of the third century. Dr. Pick's translations are prefaced by full bibliographies, almost wholly German. Of the few English books to which he refers some important ones have evidently not been used by him, e. g., Conybeare's Acts of Apollonius, with its striking Armenian form of the Thecla story. The Ethiopic form of this is apparently unknown to Dr. Pick, although he mentions the Greek, Coptic, Latin, Syriac, and Armenian. The Ethiopic form of the incident of Paul and the Christian lion found in the Epistle of Pelagia seems also to have escaped Dr. Pick (p. 3), while no account is taken of the fourth-century fragments of the Acts of Peter and of John recently discovered and pub- lished by Professor Grenfell and Dr. Hunt (Oxyrhynchus Papyri, VI, Nos. 849, 850) It would seem that English materials bearing on the Acts are little known even by name to Dr. Pick. He has done well, however, in this volume in presenting a brief introduction to each of the works translated. These will do much to make these curious stories significant and interesting to English readers. It is disappointing to find that little material has been derived by Dr. Pick from the Coptic discoveries of Schmidt, perhaps on account of the fragmentary character of the Coptic Acts. The Acts of Thomas is the only complete work in the collection, and now appears for the first time in a complete English translation. Dr. Pick's book should do much to extend acquaint- ance with this branch of early Christian literature. BR-HIER, EMILE. Philon: Commentaire allhgorique des Saintes Lois aprds l'euvre des six jours.

The entire field and subject-matter of church history are clearly and minutely outlined, and references are made to the larger works of Alzog, Schaff, Hurst, Kurtz, Moeller, and Newman. It is a marvel of condensation and of fulness of topical reference. It is more than a bare chronicle of events and dates. The author has treated his material with historic appreciation of its continuity and sequence.

Some features are lacking that would make it an ideal textbook. The addition of a few maps would have greatly increased its value. Analecta Bollandiana. Tomus XXVI, Fasc. I.

Of the five articles which comprise the first 99 out of the i60 pages of this quarterly we shall call attention to only two and that briefly. Paul Peeters' article entitled Une version arabe de la Passion de sainte Catherine d'Alexandrie gives an Arabic version of this legend edited from the copy of a manuscript found at Homs in 1902o, and believed by Father Cheikho to be about a hundred and fifty years old. The Arabic text is accompanied by a Latin translation and preceded by a short discussion as to certain related versions and as to its value for the literary history of the legend. Delehaye's article Le t moignage des martyrologes is a discussion of certain con- siderations which must be kept in mind in endeavoring to estimate the historical value of these documents. Pp. Ioo-I60 are occupied with a Bulletin des publications hagio- graphiques comprising short reviews of over sixty books and articles, and a list of recent publications. WIELAND, FRANZ. Der vorirenaiische Opferbegriff. Miinchen: Leutner, 1909. 231 pages. M. 3.50o. This is No. 6 in the third series of the publications of the Munich Church History Seminar. It is a continuation of the rather strenuous controversy that, since 19o6 has been going on between Dr. Dorsch and Dr. Wieland. Dr. Wieland at the close of his introduction tells us that he herewith closes his side of the debate and turns over its historical accuracy to the judgment of science, and its dogmatic correctness to the decision of the Church. Into the merits of the controversy we cannot enter; suffice it to say that on both sides it has been conducted with much learning and not a little heat. But leaving out the controversial spirit that appears quite frequently, the volume is still one of interest to the student of the history of the Eucharist. In three main divisions covering 229 pages Dr. Wieland discusses with much.detail: the conception of the eucharistic sacrifice; the symbolical form of the conception of the eucharistic sacrifice; and the justification of the pre-irenaic conception of the sacrifice from the official church publications. ZICKENDRATH, KAle. Der Streit zwischen Erasmus und Luther liber die Willens- freiheit. Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1909. xii+205 pages. $1.0o7. This scholarly German monograph is a stimulating treatise. It opens with a promise to view the conflict between the Humanistic and Lutheran programmes of church reform from the standpoint of the Lutheran and Erasmian doctrines concerning freedom of the will, in order that the conflict between Humanism and the Reformation may be treated to a certain degree as the history of the controversy between Luther and Erasmus and judged from the standpoint of dogma. A preliminary chapter on the causes of the controversy contains matter of much value for its historical aspects. How freedom of the will became an issue, the com-</page><page sequence="8">160 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY pulsion under which Erasmus acted in opening the controversy, especially the decisive part played by English influences and the reasons why he chose this particular teaching of Luther for his point of attack, are set forth compactly with satisfying references to the sources. The author believes that Laurentius Valla's treatise on freedom of the will, edited by Vadian in 1518, did much to develop and clarify Luther's ideas on the subject. Then follow three chapters devoted to a thorough analysis of the chief polemics produced during the controversy, Erasmus' De libero arbitrio Diatribe sive collatio, Luther's refutation, De servo arbitrio, and Erasmus' rebuttal, Hyperaspistes I and Hyperaspistes II. The arguments and opinions presented are examined from the stand- points of scriptural interpretation, history, dogma, or philosophy as the case may require. The merits of the argumentation are taken into account and weaknesses in the position of both disputants exposed by showing where subterfuge was employed. The author emphasizes the fact that the question of predestination is not whether God has determined the moral conduct of man by giving him a good or evil nature, but whether God gives aid in the use of this natural endowment for purposes which are part of an order above and outside it. That is, character and not temperament is the work of grace and freedom is the necessary condition for the operation of grace. Though the author has used among others the works of Kattenbusch, Richter, Loofs, Staub, and Lommatzsch, his minute knowledge of the sources involved and his independent view of many points give his work the merits of a fresh and original treat- ment of the subject. PRACTICAL THEOLOGY TIPPY, WORTH M. (EDITOR). The Socialized Church. New York: Eaton &amp; Mains, 1909. 228 pages. $i.oo. This is a collection of addresses delivered before the First National Conference of the Social Workers of Methodism, held at St. Louis, November 17-19, 1908. As a serious attempt on the part of a great denomination to face the industrial problems of the day this book is significant. Most of the addresses have no special merit, due no doubt to the difficulty which always attends the transition of the spoken to the written word. From the platform these addresses counted for more than from the printed page. Not a little of the material comes at second hand, and the student of the social question would better go to the same sources to which most of the writers of this book themselves went. The one address of real value is that of Miss Mary E. McDowell on "The Value of a Social Settlement in an Industrial Neighborhood." Another address on "The Relation of the Church to Employees in Department Stores" by Mr. Hanford Crawford, a St. Louis business man, is marked by a discreet silence as to the real moral questions involved. Two addresses on charity, two on the deaconess as a social worker, and one on playgrounds constitute the practical side of the book. SCIHENCK, FERDINAND S. The Sociology of the Bible. New York: The Board of Publication of the Reformed Church in America, 1909. 428 pages. $1.5o. This book has four parts. The first discusses the relation of the new science of sociology to socialism, evolution, the higher criticism, and the church. The second deals with what the writer calls "the general society of the Bible;" the third, with the kingdom of God, or "the particular society of the Bible." The last has to do with the kingdom of God in the world.</page><page sequence="9">BRIEF MENTION 161 It is difficult to review such a book as this without giving an impression of unfair- ness. The English is poor. The punctuation is often wrong. The style is verbose and chatty, like that of one who had preached three thousand sermons, as the author says he has done. Errors of fact are not infrequent, as when he makes Amos and Micah contemporary (p. 293). But all these might remain and yet the book might be a strong book. But when one compares p. 168 and p. 339, and sees the summary of the report of the Committee of Fifteen given in both places, but in a very different form, one is led to doubt the accuracy of the author in everything he has written. He can be forgiven for padding, but not for speaking on p. 168 of a recent investigation, which really took place prior to 1893, as is evident from p. 339. It is Mr. Goodrich on p. 168 and Mr. Goodchild on p. 339. The homiletical character of the book is fur- ther illustrated by the author's fondness for the figure 3. There are three kinds of sym- pathy (p. 122) three prevalent vices (p. 339), three prominent characters of our barba- rous ancestors (p. 378), three peculiarities of land laws (p. 200oo), three designed effects of the Golden Rule (p. 243), and many other similar sets of three. As a whole, the book denotes a large amount of patient work, and it is to be regretted that the author has not taken more pains to reach both conciseness and correctness of expression. LEEDS, SAMUEL PENNIMAN. The Christian Philosophy of Life. Sermons preached in the Dartmouth College Church. Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin Co., 1908. xix+3o3 pages. $1.25. From the helpful college pastorate of forty years--itself a notable achievement in these days-Dr. Leeds has chosen -nineteen sermons upon great realities to represent his Christian philosophy of life. It is a good philosophy, ethical, spiritual, with the glory of self-sacrifice in it. It is evident that the college preacher was an open-minded man during this generation of changing views. At the same time the sermons do not indicate any attempt to give to the students the reconstruction of modern religious thought or to lead them to an appreciation of the larger social significance of Christianity. One notes that the future life and the blessing of heaven bulk largely in the preacher's thought, but it is always presented with soberness and ethical emphasis. WINKWORTH, SUSANNA. The History and Life of the Reverend Doctor John Tauler of Strassbourg. With Twenty-five of His Sermons. New York: Eaton &amp; Mains, 1907. 426 pages. $1.50 net. This accomplished translator who has done so much to make accessible to English readers the treasures of German hymnody has done good service in translating the history and sermons of Tauler. That strange history in which the evolution of a true mystic is traced in symbolic fashion she regards as a veritable biography of Tauler and bases her own story of his life upon its essential accuracy. She has also included a study of his companions, The Friends of God. The chief interest of the work is in the sermons translated into simple idiomatic English. The sermons have been chosen, as the Preface indicates, not as representative of the whole of Tauler's teaching, but as those most practically useful to modern life. They are genuine religious expressions. Asceticism is recognized as valuable, but its dangers are not ignored; the Catholic sacraments are of course assumed, but they are always subordinate to the spiritual approach to God; the Scriptures are interpreted according to the uncritical allegorical method of the Middle Age, but, while interpretation is fanciful, the idea educed is</page><page sequence="10">162 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY simple and beautiful; the supreme conception of religion is union with God, almost absorption in God, but it is ever secured, not by detached meditation, but by human sympathy and love. The social gospel of today must not lose that strain of mysticism which ever belongs to the deep religious life. And the pure, sweet spirit of the godly and heroic Tauler may speak to us from that troubled fourteenth century a message of peace in service, and perfection through sacrifice, that may do us good.

Dogmatik (5te u. 6te verbesserte Auflage). Tiibingen: Mohr, 1909. viii+ 672 pages. The latest edition of Kaftan's Dogmatik contains seventeen pages more than the immediatdly preceding edition. The new material belongs almost entirely to the Prolegomena. No essential change in point of view is indicated, however. Some of the points emphasized in the additional pages are the voluntaristic rather than intellectualistic character of faith, the normative function of revelation in dogmatics, and the necessity of theology coming to an understanding with philosophy. This last does not mean, however, that the great follower of Kant and Ritschl would so far forget himself as to approve the metaphysical attempt to establish an objective unity of scientific and religious knowledge. The only real or possible unity is subjective, viz., the unity of belonging to one and the same experiencing subject. Every church must have its own apologetics as well as its own dogmatics, Platonism furnishing the apologetic of Greek Catholicism, Aristotelianism that of the Roman church, and Kan- tianism, with its substitution of epistemology for metaphysics, that of Protestantism. One notices that Professor James's "will to believe" is approved, but his combination of mysticism with empiricism in the" Varieties of Religious Experience" is criticized. Wendt is criticized for making the gospel preached by Jesus the sole scriptural norm of dogmatics, instead of the whole New Testament; the gospel preached by Jesus is not the whole gospel. An important service would be rendered to English readers by the translation of this monumental work.</page><page sequence="11">BRIEF MENTION 163 KNox, G. W. The Gospel of Jesus the Son of God: An Interpretation for the Modern Man. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1909. xx+ 119 pages. $0.50. Knox recognizes that a gospel to be valid today must meet the religious needs of modern men. These needs are in many respects unique. Neither the method of authority in theology, nor the traditional idea of a uniform Christian experience, is any longer sufficient. This necessitates a restatement of fundamental Christian truth, which is here made in terms of Jesus' faith in God as Father and the disciples' faith in Jesus as the Son of the Father. BALLARD, FRANK.. The People's Religious Difficulties. London: Culley, 1909. 6o4 pages. 3s. 6d. Dr. Ballard has been conducting a series of popular conferences, at which ques- tions have been freely presented to him by the auditors, to be answered by the speaker. This book contains a thousand such questions, with Dr. Ballard's replies. As would be expected, most of the queries betray a rather superficial understanding of the problems of religious belief. The collection presents, however, an unusually valuable glimpse of the questions which "the people" are asking concerning Christianity. The replies are tactfully and honestly given, and serve to indicate how many difficulties are caused solely by indefensible views as to the inspiration of the Bible or the nature of religious belief. The volume includes five main divisions entitled, I, "Popular 'Determinism;'" II, "God, Prayer and the Mystery of Pain;" III, "The Bible in Modern Light;" IV, "Christ and Christianity;" V, "Social Questions and Socialism." OTTO, RUDOLF. Goethe und Darwin. Darwinismus und Religion. Gittingen: Vanderhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1909. 40 pages. M. 75. The author of these essays shows why Goethe is not to be regarded as a precursor of Darwin and considers the problem of whether a biological theory is in any sense applicable to religious thought. That Darwinism is being applied to non-biological fields is clearly pointed out. Pragmatism, however, can never attain to absolute truth. The question reduces to the relation of the natural to the supernatural and is to be solved only by the transcendental idealism of Kant and Fries. The finality of Darwinism may be doubted but naturalism will persist. No theory of nature can apply to the realm of spirit within which the religious problem arises. In the course of the discussion it is shown that Kant anticipated Darwin in every particular. GUYOT, F. L'apologctique de Brunetiare. Paris: Nourry, 1909. 81 pages. Fr. 1.25. The author distrusts all apologetic. Hence the inevitable conclusion that the apologetic of Brunetibre is without value. The discussion that intervenes is both his- torical and critical and derives worth from the interesting personality under con- sideration. But his apologetic is traditional, non-progressive, and abounds in logical defect. To become progressive, Guyot thinks that Catholicism must substitute a larger idea of God than its present anthropomorphism, and must cease to claim for itself the sole possession of truth. Religion, however, is a sentiment or intuition rather than a matter of reason, and excludes the possibility of any apologetic.</page><page sequence="12">164 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY MISCELLANEOUS KOCHLER, F. (EDITOR). Frei und gewiss im Glauben. Beitraige zur Vertiefung in das Wesen der christlichen Religion. 35 Referate aus der Arbeit der "Religi6sen Diskussionsabende." Pfarrer in Berlin. Berlin: Arthur Glaue Verlag, 1909. vii+2o4 pages. M. 2. This collection of papers represents an effort to correlate freedom in religious think- ing with that demand for certitude which is essential to all religion. The discussions are grouped under five headings which consider themes relating to the introduction to the study of the Christian religion, questions of philosophy, of New Testament inter- pretation, of the problems of faith and morality, of church practice and present religious sentiment. It is inevitable that in so small a volume so wide a field of discussion can only be outlined. The papers by Harnack and Kaftan particularly are given in barest outline. Yet the collection as a whole presents effectively the views of those who, while demanding emancipation from all theological traditions, insist upon the power of "the historically given gospel." A few papers are of very limited interest because they deal with church problems of a national type. HUCKEL, OLIVER. Mental Medicine. Some Practical Suggestions from a Spir- itual Standpoint. Five Conferences with Students at the Johns Hopkins Medical School. With an Introduction by Llewellys F. Barker, M.D. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co. xxxii+2i9 pages. These addresses were given "as an illustration of the new suggestive thought of the physical aspects of spiritual work." A psychotherapy is advocated "which makes the very least possible use of hypnotism, and which depends largely on methods of absolute sincerity with the patient, and the re-education of the mentality with the con- scious co-operation of the patient." The discussion is popular rather than scientific. The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. Edited by Samuel Macauley Jackson, D.D., LL.D.

New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1909. xv+500 and xvi+508 pages. $5.oo per volume. The volumes of this work are appearing with pleasing rapidity. The general character of the encyclopedia as indicated by the previous volumes continues unchanged. The large German element, the conservative attitude on biblical and theological matters, and the disproportionate emphasis upon biographies are still evident. But, notwithstanding, the volume constitutes a valuable work of reference. The more important articles in the fourth volume are "Easter," "Eastern Church," "Egypt," "Church of England," "Enlightenment" (by Troeltsch), "Ethics," "Evolution," "Exegesis," "Faith," "Francis of Assisi," and "French Revolution." The bibliog- raphies attached to the larger articles are fairly full and fresh, and constitute one of the best elements in the encyclopedia. Among items of theological interest in the fifth volume are articles on "God" and "Immortality," each giving in the main merely a survey of past and present opinions. Several topics of special interest to Bible students come up for treatment. There is a</page><page sequence="13">BRIEF MENTION 165 good descriptive article on "Hammurabi and His Code," closing with a few cautious remarks about the Babylonian antecedents of the Hebrew laws. There is also a lengthy article upon "Hebrew Language and Literature," two-thirds of which describes the Hebrew language and poetry. One of the American editors has added a brief and very general discussion of Old Testament literature. A wholly fresh treatment of the subject might better have served the needs of the readers for whom this work is intended. In the article "Hexateuch" one looks for a more thorough discussion of some of the vital problems of Old Testament study. Space enough has been appro- priated for a substantial contribution, but the subject-matter proves disappointing. The first five pages, condensing the original articleJof Strack, gives a none too lucid summary of the documentary method of explaining the origin of the Hexateuch, and an equal amount of space is taken by Davis to present the traditional view of the Mosaic authorship of the entire Pentateuch. The first part of the article is scarcely more than a general survey of critical opinion, while the writer of the second part seems to assume that the reader has no critical interest in the subject. In the New Testament field, Nash writes briefly but illuminatingly'upon "Gospel and Gospels." He fittingly remarks upon the need of attention to the historical situa- tion in which the gospels arose if one would understand these writings, but the literary problem in connection with their origin is largely neglected. Moderately critical results as to date are advocated. Mark is placed shortly before 70 A. D., Luke between 70 and 80, Matthew between 75 and 90. The authorship of the first three gospels is not discussed, but the Fourth Gospel, in essentially its present form, is thought to come from the apostle John while at Ephesus during the last decade of the first century. The summary of Zahn's article on "Hebrews" is the other principal contribution in the field of New Testament introduction. Several topics of more general interest, e. g., "Missions to the North American Indians," add to the usefulness of the work.</page></plain_text>
