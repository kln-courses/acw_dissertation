<plain_text><page sequence="1">REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN* T HERE is a dispiriting view of history and humanity in the world today. The present phenomenon in human affairs is seen simply as another instance of the rise and fall of empires. It is the age-old shifting of power from some nations possessed of it to others that are not, a necessary readjustment of societies in their relations to each other and the changed conditions of their exist- ence on the globe. It is a great objective event, like those of ages past, in Sumer, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Spain, France. . A civilisation appears for a time and then is hurried away into the shades of history so that nothing remains except the record of its rise and fall, and the lesson we learn from seeing another repetition of the origin, growth and death of some particu- lar order of society. Such grand movements of events have about them the inevitableness of destiny. And it is this fatal pattern of human vicissitude that is making such an impression on us today. It has the force of a massive social fact. Indeed, the war even appears as a natural occurrence for which there is no human re- sponsibility, no source of its evil in man's own life and purposes. When we have come to this pass, in our reflections, we have reached the stage of disbelief in man, that he is a being who has to choose between good and evil and who is free to do so. We can lose our hold on the importance of the human spirit in various ways. Sometimes it is due to an absorption with the advancement of learning. We then take the great scientific way of knowledge and brush aside the anthropomorphic images that con- fuse us in the search for an impersonal law of nature. We aban- don, too, the primitive love of certainty, since we learn with our science that present knowledge is but a step to the discovery of evidence which will require another whole organisation of thought, and so on repeatedly. But in spite of our having to relinquish a definitive explanation of things, the progress of science itself sustains us, for experience is always enriched by new knowledge, and the prospect of having to make further inquiry is but the promise of a richer disclosure of reality. Thus man comes to * The presidential address to the Eastern Division of the American Philo- sophical Association, University of Pennsylvania, December 27, I940. 162</page><page sequence="2">REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN rejoice in the infinity of scientific learning. And when we have once formed our philosophy of physical Nature we turn around to deal with a long-besetting consciousness of ourselves, which though pushed aside, in our eagerness for objective knowledge, has dogged us all the while. For this knowledge of man we are prepared with the scientific habits of thought derived from the study of Nature. Our first approach to the new subject, then, is to resolve man into his obvious behavior and treat him as a natural phenomenon. The reality of the spirit is ignored or excluded by such a view of humanity. Thus many thoughtful men have protested, and they have taken their stand on history. For a hundred years history has competed with science for attention. From the first it was realised that historical knowledge cannot be squared with the knowledge of natural science. For one thing, the role of accident and con- tingency is much too prominent; further, creative roles have to be admitted in personalities or the policies of States, and creation means the unexpected which one can only find, not infer. History has to do with events and eventualities which are not generally repeated. While it contains some science, its distinctive feature is its disclosure of complex individualities which are not understood by resolving them into elements and relations but only by a form of comprehensive appreciation that is not unlike art. Because of these features historical knowledge has long appeared to stand in significant contrast to the scientific form, as something distinct and concerned with different subject-matter. Thus "the sciences of the spirit" have been distinguished from the "sciences of na- ture". In the first flush of discovery of this historical realm those who explored it interpreted all history as a "phenomenology of the Spirit". There resulted a survey of the many marvellous and devious ways in which reason is operative in the course of human history. This was no sooner presented than it provoked a defiant negative in others of different experience and sympathies, men who would not pronounce any blessing upon the inequalities of civilisation and who in revulsion against that spiritualistic inter- pretation made much of the material factors that determine the forms of society and its institutions, morals, beliefs, philosophies, i63</page><page sequence="3">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW and religions. This reaction brought history down to identifiable fact and opened up fields of research in political economy, sociol- ogy and anthropology which have been as ardently cultivated as any of the natural sciences. The story of mankind has come to be told generally in terms of an economic determination. History in this form has not been a stronghold of belief in the spirit. But while some have explored this materialistic dialectic others have obstinately clung to their original notion of the importance of spirit, especially as it appears in human art, morality and re- ligion. Seeking to make more secure the foundations of their belief they have singled out for attention time which is the form of all history and experience. They have distinguished between time as it is real for the spirit and time as it is reckoned with objectively in Nature. And whereas for many years there has been a studied avoidance of the term "soul", some even going out of their way to write their books on inquiry and knowledge almost entirely in the passive voice lest they confess by use of the active to the existence of the long-shunned "soul", these spokesmen for the spirit now bravely take the personal view and even use the maligned term "subjective". The fear of the soul is not so great as it was.1 Outside the halls of learning men are thinking about these matters. They are disposed to believe something from both the philosophies of history. At one time they claim that they are free to determine their own lives; they believe, too, that it is they who make public policy and that their State and society are controlled by the law which they have laid down. But when they behold tremendous historical changes occurring before their eyes and beyond their control in distant continents they are impressed by the determinism of history. They then interpret their national life and their own personal existence according to the materialistic version. But they are restless and troubled by such contradictions. They are anxious to know the truth. But then they learn, from the works of the wise, that truth is what men are agreed upon in their social community, and they cannot see that truth can be See A. A. Bowman: Spirit-Time, Proceedings of the Aristotelian Soci- ety; Studies in the Philosophy of Religion, Macmillan, I938; The Sacra- mental Universe, Princeton University Press, 1939; and the works of W.

They turn next to the question of settling what is right so that the na- tional differences of men can be composed and the search for im- partial truth continued. But in this matter of "right" they learn the same disheartening doctrine, hearing mostly about the rela- tivity of morals, little about ethical soundness or absolute value. They find it an accepted social truth that everything depends upon society and the prevalent "mores". Anything whatsoever can be valued as right or good, if men are accustomed to it in their par- ticular social life. Even justice itself, that solid foundation of any life in community, is regarded as merely the rule of life that is established by the prevailing class or political elements in the society. So the demon of sophistry tempts men to believe that it is only power that matters, and that greatness takes the place of goodness, greatness measured by the vast magnitude of the effects wrought by social power. Once believing that, man is on the down- ward slope which leads to the denial of any real, absolute distinc- tion between good and evil. That way is moral disaster. But the men of our time do not yet believe all these things because they they still retain a belief in themselves. They are merely dispirited and in a state of confusion, seeking the clear, steadying light of philosophy. Meantime we have witnessed what men can do who have a clear purpose and the self-assurance and unscrupulousness to go ahead to attain their ends without regard for anything. They have gained an advantage from the fears and confused helplessness of the rest of the world. They find nothing disheartening in the his- torical view of civilisation. The picture of the rise and fall of nations has no terrors for them. They always attribute the dire "fate" to others, to other States, nations, races, and never to themselves who are destined to dominate. That fatal law of history is only true, in any case, for those who believe it, since all truth depends on believing. But those who believe in themselves can make their own truth, as they do their morals, art, philosophy, religion. So where the others watch the inexorable march of events, as muddled, helpless observers, these high-spirited fellows place themselves at the head of the column, and proceed to make his- tory with themselves cast in the role of the "men of destiny". I65</page><page sequence="5">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW This destiny-notion then becomes an instrument of their public policy, part of their very armanent and diplomacy. Thus it is they overcome Historismus, by identifying themselves with triumphant force and boldly disregarding humanity and all that men have considered right and sacred. The record of history itself is going to depend upon the number of people everywhere who are captured by their arms or ideas, who admire them and follow them without thought of anything else. It is in order now to examine again the nature of history and its meaning for man. The events of human history, like those of Nature, have endless, multiple connections with each other that admit of being related in any number of ways. If we are in quest of regularities, we can induce them from the mixture; and so it is that we have our general knowledge of human behavior and our social and political and economic sciences. There is some regular order, else we should not know ourselves in any useful way. This knowledge, like all science, is never rounded out in any final system of laws. But there is another interest, that of the poet and of those who tell a story of human doings and what happens to men. Here the narra- tion has a dramatic form, with a beginning, a middle and an end. It is centered about something of concern. In history man carves out the episodes of his story from the raw materials of fact ac- cording as they have significance for him and his contemporaries, and when he has expressed the meaning of it all he regards his knowledge as complete, and stops as an artist does with his crea- tion. The first subjects of history are the family, tribe, dynasty, nation, State or some relatively enduring social body whose exist- ence means something to men. Inasmuch as men have the desire to live, and to live long and well, and since they recognize, in some way or other, their dependence upon the society in which they have their being, they come to identify the life of this greater being with their own greater life, seeking, as it were, a secular immortality. So men are concerned about the past and the future of their own land and kin and of all else with whose fortunes [VOL. L. I66</page><page sequence="6">No. 2.] REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN they may come to identify their own existence. They may even learn to interest themselves in a whole civilisation. Primitively, however, history has to do with much closer associations. Thus epic poetry is clearly history composed under the inspiration of a personal interest, and it celebrates the wonderful significance of the deeds of those men who have made the story it tells. Human characters are represented, as well as the events in which they participated, and these figures, admirable and heroic, or ignoble and weak, exhibit all that goes into the life of a nation, the diversi- ties of men, their interactions with each other, the issues that are decisive for their common life, the judgments of good and evil. Early history is a selective reinstatement of the past of that na- tion to which those who hear or read it belong. Being something of an art it expresses the man who fashions it. Whatsoever ethical ideas are coursing through the mind of the poet, or whatever bat- tles of the spirit he may be fighting, these all get written into the story. And the man, too, who hears the tale knows that it is his own life-history, for he is of that same nation, descended of those men of the past, made what he is by their virtue, and bound to be like them in greatness and goodness. In the art of history, then, men are seeking to know themselves. What has happened in the past, being related to them, tells them what they are, what the promise of their destiny is, and what they must do, for their part, in the present. Even if the subject of historical interest later comes to be something remote from home, another land or people, those who are engrossed by it find it sig- nificant for the understanding of what they are concerned about in their present situation, and they decipher their own predicaments in the account of those other men and other times. But such histori- cal knowledge is not merely useful, it is intrinsically satisfying. It extends the experience of man and enlarges his consciousness of himself. It makes the dynasty or the State or the folk more real for everyone who has any connection with its historical career. To realize in the historical pageantry an ancestral kinship or be- longing to the city or some other fellowship is to enjoy an enrich- ment of existence. This is so even if the story is not all one of victory. Sharing in defeats as well as glories makes the continued life of the society all the more magnificent. History in its first in- I67</page><page sequence="7">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW tention is thus an enhancement of present life and of the sense of man's worth. So it is in the beginning, and whenever history retains its primi- tive meaning. But when the intercourse of nations brings peoples into cognisance of each other so that they see their differing his- tories, they acquire a more sophisticated view. The poetry departs its own way to tell the story of man regardless of fact, and history moves ahead under the impulse of a new motive of curiosity and an ambition to give a more adequate, and consequently truer, ac- count. Moreover, when men can survey fields beyond the past and present of their own native history, the subject of their study expands with their purview. It is then the Hellenic world or Europe, or a civilisation, or even all mankind. With these wider views and a more scientific purpose comes the stern demand of science for perfect impartiality and detachment. The personal concern that has motivated history thus retreats before the love of knowledge. But it is never annihilated, and it wins more vic- tories than are admitted in the historian's preface. For without the personal element, history must lose its primary reason for exist- ence. As history becomes truer, in accordance with the scientific criterion, it actually moves, not away from all personal meaning, but to deeper levels of the human concern for life. Consider the correction of the too-ideal coloring of patriotic history. The more impartial science has disclosed facts that had not been deemed worthy of remembrance-failures, wrongs, evil, and stupidity, weakness, unscrupulous ambition in men. The past becomes less grand, but it is more intelligible. The examples are less heroic but they are more suitable for emulation. Thus there is greater ver- isimilitude to life. Those unwelcome instances which honest report- ing discovers reveal all the better how life is an affair of vicissi- tudes-fortune and misfortune, evil-doing as well as doing good, struggle, defeat as well as victory, and always great uncertainty as to the outcome and the values that will survive. History depicts these truths on a large canvass portraying what happened to whole States or nations. It shows us civilisations, one after another, ris- ing and passing away, the perennial course of life and death. Here in spite of all efforts of detachment the man who tells the story is [VOL. L. i68</page><page sequence="8">No. 2.] REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN doing so by reference to the most profound of all personal con- cerns, the realisation that life has a course which ends in death. For of all the things that happen in the experience of man this is the one fact that we can never understand, especially when close to us. In history we see it writ large as on the walls of our cave, in an artist's record of the rise and fall of whole generations of men. The account of history is presented in accordance with this form that holds of our personal existence and we find ourselves contemplating life and death with more detachment and, because it is so immense a thing, with an even heightened impression of its significance. Here is a critical point morally. History can inspire us or it can make us dispirited. Historical knowledge is a continuous high- way between the present and the past, with time's separating barriers down. Through it we become, in a sense, contemporaries of those who have gone before us, and through being with them in spirit we can become identified with them and strive to be like them. What is good and great in them contributes, then, to the sense of the worth of our own life; what is defective or bad makes us know the things that we are to overcome in ourselves. Such knowledge magnifies humanity, and gives strength to do what a man ought to do to live well and greatly. But the very route that can bring such power to life through knowing the past can also drain away man's own native strength and diminish his sense of worth. Instead of seeing into the life of others he may stay only at the superficial level of an observer without participation in their concern.2 He may be too greatly impressed by the historical changes and futile struggles and unable to discern any final good attained at any time. He may come to see nothing but natural readjustments of society, abstracted from all judgment of right or good. He is then overwhelmed by the unmeaning procession of events that happen regardless of anything man can do about them. To be contemporary with the past of mankind so regarded is to be reduced oneself to the very same insignificance that men appear to have in it. So it is that man begins to disbelieve in himself and in the things with which he had been concerned as having meaning Cf. Warner Fite: The Living Mind, Ch. ii, "The Agent and the Ob- server". The Dial Press, 1930. See also Moral Philosophy, Dial Press, x926. 169</page><page sequence="9">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW for his own life, his State or his Divinity. All things seem to go down to death with man himself. One must go beyond history to deal with this question of its meaning. Beyond history is philosophy, poetry, religion. In them man deals more directly with the things of personal concern. The question of life and death is here met face to face and examined. It is no longer an implicit, unexamined motif that shapes the his- torical version of human destiny. Here man looks into the sheer meaning of destiny. And some who have had it revealed to them have conducted their own lives accordingly and made decisions which moved others to follow their principles or their faith so that they have counted greatly in the course of history. Before considering these high examples of the spirit of man, triumphant over death, it is well to see man in the largest possible perspective. History, as we generally know it, is the history of civilisations. But the history of mankind reaches farther than that of civilised societies. There are records of the man of pre-history. By taking into account the knowledge we have from these sources we may be able to discern some essential characters of humanity through the ages, in primitive man as well as in our sages and saints. It is, of course, hazardous to say anything about man in primi- tive forms of society and culture. Literature has abounded with fancies and speculations. The science of anthropology itself has had to discipline its devotees to keep them from spreading their own private fictions as well as those which men of great imagina- tive genius have made current. Aside from the errors due to guessing what the facts are when the evidence is scanty, there are the mistakes of emphasis in interpreting a complex of data which we do not yet understand according to any certain princi- ples. The risk of falsity is especially great when we venture to speak of the primitive mind. We have learned from the historical method that we are all limited in our mentality by the conditions of our existence, the structure of society around us, the habits, activities, needs, interests that define our familiar world. How can we know, then, what was the framework of active experience for [VOL. L. I70</page><page sequence="10">No. 2.] REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN early peoples, by what paths they trod, what they saw on their journey, what things were assured and what uncertain, what affec- tions, ambitions, faiths they had? The disparity between our two worlds seems enough to justify an outright caveat on any recon- struction of the mind of primitive man. Yet we continue to be in- terested and curious, because we discern many significant traits which make us want to know more. Man has been very properly characterised as a tool-making animal. The earliest records of him are stone implements that have weathered many thousands of years of exposure or accident, and the sequences of techniques and styles exhibited in them are, indeed, sometimes the sole memorials of whole cultures. It was natural for a being with no extraordinary physique to turn his wit and hand to the fabrication of what he needed to provide for him- self. Throughout the record man appears to have had such initia- tive, resourcefulness and invention. It was also necessary, for the sake of survival, that men should be able to live in forms of social solidarity. At the stage of sheer subsistence among the elemental forces of Nature they had to dwell together, hunt together, dance together, paint the pictures of their desire together, and go through all manner of ritual practices that established the binding relationships and customs on which they had to count for a living. It is when we encounter the facts of totemism and a vast range of religious practices that our intelligence seems unable to draw any natural inferences. These ceremonial activities seem to be such a waste of time and energy-a large part of days and even months so spent. In the case of totemism man was immensely con- cerned with his totem and the creatures and objects identified with it. We can see that these practices would have some bearing on the social organisation and that they would give sanction to certain affiliations and distinctions that must be observed in society. We may even suspect that in identifying themselves with all of their totem they were taking a step toward self-knowledge, by referring to themselves as such-an-one and as different from other men given the name of another totem. But we are warned against such philosophical ventures beyond the natural interpreta- tions which must hew close to the practical necessities of the case. I7I</page><page sequence="11">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW For it is believed that man's everlasting problem is that of adapting himself to the conditions of his physical environment and a social existence. Real needs such as food, clothing, shelter, sexual and other necessities, these are what call the tune and supply the motifs of the dance of life. There is no real value in anything else, which we must consequently dismiss as absurdity and an impediment to progress. We cannot understand any human being when we thus ignore all that is to him important. The religious rites, ceremonial prac- tices and various other time-wasting, useless activities, meant a great deal to primitive man. There is abundant evidence for think- ing that no matter how resourceful men were, or how supported by their social solidarity, they always felt seriously inadequate to their situation. Though they made tools and weapons, and had skilful ways of using them, they had little of the Pelagian self- confidence of the modern man regarding the unlimited capacity of his own human devices to meet the exigencies of life. They were living close to the margin and unable to make more than the scantiest provision for the future. They constantly felt their own insufficiency and terrifying uncertainty and the dread of existence. They sought and believed in other-than-human agencies; they tried to gain help from them or else to ward off their hostility; some- times using methods like those of dealing with men but going be- yond them, too, to strange ways of invocation. It is particularly interesting that they treated even their "gods" as living. Apparently they conceived all things under the form of life and they had to learn by long painful steps to think of the inanimate on the one hand and of the divine on the other. But they had to think about life, too, and more immediately, when they confronted the fact of death, especially the death of some- one near and akin to them. Their thinking, so to speak, was ex- pressed in their funerary rites and ceremonies which involved vastly more than the mere disposing of the remains of a dead body. Their practices on such occasions reflect a curious mixture of feelings in the presence of the dead. The one with whom they had lived was now uncannily devoid of his familiar animation and relationship to them and ought to be exorcised by a ceremony, lest they be haunted afterwards. On the other hand, the being [VOL. L. I72</page><page sequence="12">No. 2.] REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN that they had regarded so differently before was still one of them, in the family, and they celebrated rites that developed into ances- tor worship. Hence a care for the burial and preservation of the body and provision for its continued journey through life. All this was done in the belief that the dead existed, although no longer animated with the kind of life that those who survived knew in themselves. Thus it was their practical faith that to exist is always to live. Primitive men seem to have so believed in life that they acted as if a form of it persisted after the mystifying loss of its familiar activity. How could they imagine the being that thus sur- vived and existed beyond death? Their conception was, in literal truth, a shadowy one, the shade of man, the soul. The image was along the lines of the dream-life which was not so sharply defined from the organised waking world as in our own experience where the practical order asserts itself so undeniably against the vagaries of dream or weird fancy. Dreams figured considerably in the experience of early peoples. In their dreams men found themselves wandering about and tak- ing part in events remote from the scene where they lay when awakening. They consorted at times with those who were dead. Sometimes their dreams signified what was to come to pass; some- times they even had a causal role, making what was dreamed come to pass at the appointed time. The dreams of the dead had a special significance, recalling them to the world from which they had gone. It was perhaps inevitable for primitive minds to associate the observation of the death of their kin with their experiences of dreams and to figure out what happened at death in terms of the dream-life, viz., that a shadowy form of the man left the body to go wandering, a being still alive but in a different guise, as a ghost, a thing of breath, a soul.3 But a soul was more to them than the merely visual shadow of a reality, which is likely to be our imagination of it, living so remote from their experience. Those spirits had tremendous potency. They were sure to concern themselves about the preservation of the whole order of custom in the clan or tribe, and especially the piacu- lar rites regarding themselves. Unless these things were all duly 3Cf. A. A. Bowman, Studies in the Philosophy of Religion, Macmillan, 1938. Vol. I. Ch. iii, especially 124 ff. 173</page><page sequence="13">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW performed, as they ought to be done, dire evil must befall the living and the dead alike. Those spiritual powers thus gave a sanc- tion to primitive morality and tribal ways.4 They held men to the rules of life necessary for survival. They could work evil or bring good in their own strange mysterious ways, and the religious ritual made much, indeed, of the hidden resources of power in the spirits. So it is not the image which men formed of the soul that is to be particularly regarded so much as what they were trying thus to represent, namely, the importance of spirit, that is, of being which does not perish but has the power to live through all vicissitude and can manifest itself again and again in the world without end. By such groping beliefs in life beyond their immediate existence men were enabled to regulate their social life according to stand- ards that could not always justify themselves by reference to ob- vious utility. A certain moral obstinacy of that sort was necessary to make civilisation possible. That moral determination was founded on the apparent absurdities of their religion of the spirit. Moreover, since religion also kept man aware of the unknown, mys- terious powers of existence it abetted the impulse of curiosity to seek these out by every exercise of wit and thus to gather the ma- terials of inquiry for a knowledge of heaven and earth. In the beginning, then, science as well as morality was made possible by this primitive animistic religion. Another scene, Athens, a civilisation, and another discovery of the spirit of man. It came through one who had deliberately studied "dying and death" and who acted memorably, in accord- ance with what he learned about the mystery. The story was told by another who had not only that wisdom of his master to under- stand but also his death. When men have risen above the primitive forms of kinship society and achieved a political economy and displayed a creative genius in art, science and government, they continue for a time to remember the force of character and the strength that have made their civilisation possible. But they are apt to neglect these things 4Cf. B. Malinowski: The Foundations of Faith and Morals, Oxford, I936. Especially Ch. iv, p. 25. [VOL. L.

Their preoccupations are no longer the elemental ones but those of leisure when they can cultivate the social arts and powers. They pride themselves particularly on their skill in knowing how to govern men and enjoy their authority. The State contains their whole world and it is secure, and of course very great, and they feel that they are living well and greatly in it. Socrates was like the ancestral memory of the Athenians come to plague them. He repeated the admonitions of their own religion, that man should be moderate, or else he spoke in the language of the mystics, of the discipline of purification. But when they were unknowing in these high matters be turned to the things they thought they knew. He examined what they said about the goods, the pleasures and honors they valued. He wanted to know what they considered to be real strength or virtue. He made them look into the content of their own happiness to see if it were anything of lasting substance, for it appeared to him to be a mere phantom. But they resented the criticism, and above all, they sheered away from his mention of death. They regarded it as an unspeakable evil, to be avoided even in surmise. The important concern of man was to be sure of oneself in life. But Socrates continued to remind them that death was certain to come. He made them take their worst evil into their worldly reckoning. For what men thought about death would be truly decisive for their whole lives: if they placed their goods in things from which they would be separated at death, they would not be really in possession of any permanent good. If they knew nothing better than pleasures or the advantages of political and social position they had nothing in their lives of real value. They were thus convicted of ignorance and even cow- ardice, the cowardice of escaping from life. Socrates summoned them to take the way of courage and knowledge, the purification of philosophy which studies dying and death. But this was the opposite of all they took to be a happy existence. And Socrates had now made death to them much more than the mere dissolu- tion of the body, for his discussions had dissolved the significance of their happiness. It is not in the least surprising that Socrates should have been condemned to death for destroying Athenian values. I75</page><page sequence="15">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Socrates had not been afraid of death. He so believed in a good beyond earthly existence that he went resolutely ahead, speaking his own mind without compromise and refusing to escape his fate. That conduct was a demonstration of the convincing power which that more-than-human form of Good has to rule the life of a man who apprehends its reality. Though Socrates himself never claimed to be in possession of the final good, his very "love of such wis- dom" was strong enough to enable him to treat death as a good and not as an evil. He had participated, somehow, in an absolute spiritual power which gave his whole life as well as his death an extraordinary character. While Socrates had his "daimon" he made no pretension to be unique. Indeed, the virtue of any man is but the actuality of his knowledge, and it was this power of the mind to know and act that Socrates sought to bring out in others. This is in every man, even in the slave boy, who can recognise truth. It is the power of soul. The Athenians had neglected this power for life; Socrates made it his chief concern, even more than values. Socrates used the language of men. Soul had been the primitive term which had borne the sense of their own human significance throughout the vicissitudes of existence, especially death. The poets had kept alive that primitive animism by their imaginative play with the notion of soul, but they had not deepened the understanding of it. They told of the shades of men wandering after death in a Hades or Elysium, consorting with the dead and with the Gods. But the soul was now represented as having a larger and even more glorious realm of existence. The soul in Socrates' myths consorted with the high realities or Ideas with which it made contact in knowledge, the intelligible world. By a kind of participation the creative, determining character of those invisible, intangible Forms belonged likewise to the intellect or reason that knew them. The soul was much more, therefore, than a mere breath or shade, only dimly grasped as the giver-of-life to men. Its true activity was not that of wandering from place to place, or body to body, in a kind of somnambulism, but the power- ful activity of knowing the eternal principles of all being, an ac- tivity which moved man himself to act on earth as if it were I76 [VOL. L.</page><page sequence="16">No. 2.] REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN heaven and thus to realise the difficult and rare virtue that falters before nothing, not even death. This philosophy had to be interpreted before men could under- stand it. How ought one who follows Socrates to live in a worldly civilisation? How reconcile philosophy with the State? The author of the Symposium knew the love of life as well as the love of wis- dom, and he undertook to reason out the meaning. In the Republic Plato described a virtuous man who, when all the rest of men were lawless, took shelter against the strong con- tagion of their evil-doing and kept himself immune from it. It is Socrates himself who says that while such a man would have achieved something truly good in preserving his integrity he would still have missed the highest good, because he ought not to live alone in his virtue but associated with other good men in a State whose constitution is modelled on their principles. No wise man possesses all knowledge, or the strength of mind to live rightly at all times. No one can be wise and good in every respect. But if all who have virtue can be brought together in harmony, then everyone will learn from the others, become sensi- tive to virtues not appreciated before, know more varieties of goodness and thus come nearer to their ultimate goal of compre- hending that supreme Good which embraces all particular perfec- tions. In this way a complete society of good men who love wisdom creates the possibility of a higher realisation of the good for each and every one of them. Such a community would certainly pre- vent the tragedy of the death of a Socrates. It would be a society where a brave intelligence would be honored and given scope for action. The power of the State would be united with true philoso- phy and the philosophers would be "kings". There ought not to be only one such Socrates, but a whole community of them. Thus we see how a philosopher could live with profit to himself in the State. But we shall see, too, how it is that the State itself can live in the hearts and minds of such good men. What the members of such a perfect community have in common is their persistent love of wisdom, and its object, the Good. Through the fact that they love such a supreme good and can comprehend it better by association with others who are equally devoted to it 177</page><page sequence="17">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW they are united in their community. This experience of a common end and life affects their feelings towards each other, for since they cherish one another as examples of the good they have added mutual pleasure in each other's society. Hence they have a high regard for each other and are true friends. But behold a still further object of regard appears in their experience, for they will also love their very community itself, wherein they are so happily united in their love of the good-they have a love of the State. They envisage in it all the variety of goodness that men achieve in their mutually harmonious relations and they appeciate that it comprises more good in itself than that which any one of them individually achieves. So next to their love of the supreme Good itself they love their city-community. Over them as individuals in their severalty the republic stands supreme. Since it is more com- plete in its embodiment of human good, since it is greater in good- ness than any one man or more, it evokes a correspondingly greater sentiment of loyalty, more even than that which men feel for their friends and families. Thus it is that philosophers will regard the State, as the representative on earth of the supreme good that is being sought for beyond the State itself and in the heavens. This is the argument for beings whose ruling passion is philoso- phy. But what of men of other interests, the love of pleasure, honor, ambition and so on? How real is the State for those who have not yet been converted to the love of wisdom, The answer is that the principle of the constitution of a perfect community holds good for any society. It is the practical principle of har- mony-justice. Whatever degree of virtue men may possess, be it great or small, it is preserved and increased by living in accord- ance with justice and with some regard for the good of the whole commonwealth. No other wealth or good is secure without such loyalty and justice. What is man to do, however, when the State is flagrantly un- just, by his own standards, as when it fails to support him in doing what is right or when its laws are made to condemn him? Sup- pose the righteous man finds himself in such a situation? Is the good citizen absolved from the necessity of doing what is just be- cause he is unjustly dealt with? Is he to abandon the State of his ideal when it falls short of the ideal particularly in his own case? [VOL. L. I78</page><page sequence="18">No. 2.] REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN The true citizen loves the good that the State is intended to realise and he has committed himself to a share in its fate, its adversity, even its guilt, as well as in its wealth and goods. His love of the State should be proof against disappointment when his own per- sonal interest is touched. So the citizen ought to decide as Socrates did in the Crito. Thus Plato told the story of the most righteous man who had lived in his time. It was a demonstration of man's obligation to the State: it also demonstrated, supremely well, the spirit of man. Another scene, in a different region of the ancient world and at the beginning of an era, the suffering and death of one who had taught obedience to God and done his Will to the end. Around the person of Jesus of Nazareth there had gathered followers who believed in him and his Gospel, and after his death more came to believe. For centuries afterward many more entered into this community of faith and took their solemn vows to live as the Christ had enjoined them to do. The Christian religion made all the difference in the world to man's view of his own life and history. It sprang from the tra- dition of an older religion that was itself the affirmation of an historical belief. The Jewish people had travelled long the route of adversity and suffering, and their faith in the One God who had dominion over all others gave them assurance that they would come to the promised land after all, that the Divine Will would vouchsafe to them a good life on earth, provided they obeyed his commandments and served Him as they ought. Thus they had lived a philosophy of history which affirmed that it is the destiny of righteous men to survive and attain blessedness. However, those religious men of early days were no philosophers. Their circum- stances were very different from those of the Greeks; their genius was different, for they had not such extraordinary creative gifts in art, science and government, nor had they the political oppor- tunity to make a civilisation. But these deficiencies were an ad- vantage for their moral and religious vigor. If the supernatural power which man worships and tries to come to terms with in primitive religion is too readily acclimatised to civilisation, if I79</page><page sequence="19">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW myths can be made the subject of poetic manipulation, the ele- mental mystery to which man responds in religion may be covered by the glamor of other things, and it ceases to invigorate man to further search and action. The Jewish people retained their sense of the awful, the tremendous, the august All-Power that inspired mingled feelings of fear and love, making men flee as from a hound of Heaven, yet craving to draw near as well, to receive his com- mandments concerning what they ought to do to be righteous and to receive the aid of his Power for their lives. Religion with such strength had great ethical virtue. Those who lived by such faith learned one thing well, that man must impose upon himself a rule or standard of action which he is not to take from the world but which comes from on High as a divine law. In this world men will not attain to blessedness unless they do the transcendent Will of God, which is never for a moment to be confounded with the prevalent customs and practices of the tribe, any more than God Himself is to be confused with the idols of the tribe. So they be- lieved that sin would be overcome and the righteous would inherit the earth by their fulfilment of the Law together with the Promise of God in his covenant to see them through all evil. Many things were added or modified by Christianity in this religion, but for the present purpose this one alone is to be con- sidered: the Christian religion gave men assurance that by the will- ing sacrifice of God's own son even death is overcome, as well as the earthly penalties of sin. This extended the promised salvation beyond that of the Law. It seized more boldly upon the fact of death and looked beyond it, and beyond the whole world, to a heavenly destiny. The distinctively Christian view is developed in the recent message of the Pope to the peoples everywhere, based on the text:-"Heaven and earth shall pass, but my words shall not pass" (Matthew, 24:25-35). "Heaven and earth shall pass; this earth will pass which we tread under foot; this earth torn up and tortured by our steel to expose the tombs of the dead past ... This old sphere of ours will pass, which seems no longer to suf- fice for men or to satisfy their contentious aspirations, which in our days have enkindled a conflagration of such gigantic dimen- sions that it surpasses and almost throws into obscurity the most grandiose events and upheavals in the history of the world. The [VOL. L. i80</page><page sequence="20">No. 2.] REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN earth will pass, and we shall all have to appear before the judg- ment seat of Christ, that everyone may receive reward or punish- ment according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil; but the word of Christ shall not pass.... He tells them (those who follow him) 'you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you be not troubled. For these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet'" (Matthews, 24:6.) Believing assurances of this sort the Christians gathered to- gether in their communities and preserved their faith in the undy- ing holy spirit. Christ's own victory over death was a new promise of salvation. It gave vigor to the lives of men and enabled them to increase their fellowship in the faith against all earthly powers of oppression. It sent some of them out to make sacrifices for it, doing their Master's bidding; and these heroisms and martyrdoms confirmed the faith of others and brought many more into the fold. It inspired some to devote themselves to teaching and others to do good works of mercy. It gave them confidence, too, when they encountered the questions of the mind and of ancient phi- losophy, and they shaped their knowledge of God and his relation to man into theology. In all these things the Christians started from that central mystery of death which was at the same time the revelation of God to man. Thus later when the city of Rome fell before barbarian invaders a priest from Carthage was ready to interpret to his own day the meaning of the catastrophe. The fall of a State once believed to be eternal shattered the last remaining faith of pagan mankind in the sufficiency of the political State. But the passing of the dominion of Rome meant more than that. Such an outcome was inevitable as long as men lived sinfully, and only with secular interests. Augustine wrote his history of the decline and fall of Rome as a drama of mankind without religion, and he held up to men the faith they must have and the duties they must perform if they were to be worthy of the City of God. And Augustine set out to de- mand the hard performance of the Christian duty of man in this world. His policy was not to temporise or cooperate with the in- vaders, accepting them as they were, but to command them in their seeming strength to humble themselves before the Will of God and become Christian. The Church carried on that tradition. And I8I</page><page sequence="21">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW it recalled too, as we have just heard, man's responsibility to God, the coming of the final day of judgment and the everlasting im- portance of holding fast to the good and putting down the evil in this world. The ethics of Christianity require action and sacrifice. The models of Christian virtue are those close at home where the obli- gations are intimate and personal, the duties of forbearing love. The cherished characters are those in the family, a father who loves his children, or a pure heart or one with the simplicity of the child. Beyond the familiar circle, the Christian is bidden to love all men likewise, even those who commit sin and evil, for they are in dire need of the merciful grace of God, as, indeed, all men alike are. Man is to trust in the spirit, as the true and only righteous power of redemption. But he is also commanded to make himself known and to act according to his conscience when it pronounces that one deed is good and another is evil and enjoins him to abhor that which is evil. This personal ethics had a moral vitality and universal vision that enabled the peoples believing in these things to form out of the struggles of principalities and empires a dis- tinctive European civilisation, during those times which we call the Middle Ages. Eventually, then, the men of this faith had to govern a political and social order. The doctrines of Christianity were not conceived originally with any such idea of the general governance of man- kind beyond the very small communities of the cult itself. But they were intended to interpret the commandments of God to men in their actual life in society, which is full of selfish interests, ambi- tions, politics and wars. Thus Christianity had to be involved in law and government and matters political. Again and again there was too ready compromise with human weakness, falsity and in- justice, too great an eagerness to encompass the whole world in one faith, too much reliance upon temporal power, and a conse- quent apostasy to the Christian Gospel. But again and again, too, the imperatives of the faith have been obeyed and applied in the social life of a generation, and they have redeemed many an evil situation. The ethical imperatives had arisen from the belief in God and what He has commanded man to do, that he should love his neighbor in the same spirit as God loves all mankind. The I82 [VOL. L.</page><page sequence="22">No. 2.] REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN eternal example is, of course, the life of Jesus and his death for the salvation of men. This supreme sacrifice demonstrates the sanctity of every human person. It proves, indeed, that the spirit of man is too holy to be touched by death, which always seems to men in ordinary moods to have the last, destructive word. The personality of man is seen to be worthy of reverence not only at death but throughout all of a life-time. So it is that while man ought to stand firm on the ethical good and fight the destructive evil, he still has to act so as to be his brother's keeper. And in the sequel of history this Christian obligation has come to mean that, notwithstanding the unequal orders, ranks and values of men in the social system, every one in such society must be treated as an equal person. With equality of worth there comes personal free- dom, a principle capable of infinite development as the conception of a personal life in community develops. These have been more than desiderata or merely things hoped-for; more than ideals of philosophers; they have been moral and religious necessities, part of the justification of life, as having a meaning beyond the brief period of our earthly existence. And the course of history itself has had a significance because of these obligations and imperatives of religion. The story of mankind has meaning only when it is interpreted by reference to them and to the conception of man which is involved in them. There is no destiny revealed in history save that of persons and their freedom as spiritual beings. The fate-motif in history is a spurious notion of destiny seen as belonging to temporal powers, states, races, civilisations. The record of human existence made under the influence of such a notion is therefore false, or, at the best, gravely inadequate and misinforming. Besides the rise and fall of civilisations there is a profounder continuity of man's life on earth which contains things of unfading memory, the record of poetry and art, the lives of heroes of the spirit, the history of human faith and works. The knowledge of these things flashes across the void of dark ages be- tween social epochs and establishes a unity of spiritual relationship which is the permanent warp for the experimental weavings of the historical Fates as they design and redesign their mortal em- I83</page><page sequence="23">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW pires. The relativity of ethics and other values holds only as be- tween these different patterns that are worked out on the main strand of human history. But what makes such history itself pos- sible, what enables men to reach back into the past and establish communication with others and even to learn how different they are, in many respects, is the recognition of a common character, the dynamic regenerative character of the spirit of man. It is a power that is always out of the ordinary. Those who have it (and they have to seek it before they find it) look beyond what men commonly are to what they can and ought to become. They pre- scribe norms of conduct for themselves, some law of justice or the will of God, not because these are required by society, or even useful, but because these things are the imperatives of a personal life. Obligation derives its meaning from this source. It is not because a political State itself is intrinsically more worthy than man that an individual is obliged to devote his life to its preserva- tion and welfare, but because the worth of all persons without ex- ception requires them, one and all, to submit their will to the principle of a way of life in which all these individuals are to realise their freedom and personal destiny. This moral attitude has been one of the conditions that enables civilisation to come into being; in the crises of civilisation it is also the rallying point of the new order of life to come. And this morality is but one of the various manifestations of spirit discoverable in the record. Our history should be great enough to include a complete inter- pretation of men and events or else it should subordinate itself to a philosophical knowledge that will contribute what appears to be often missing in historical knowledge. This does not mean en- trusting history professionally to the philosophers. It is only in the lives of great and good men that the operation of spiritual powers is unmistakably disclosed and the truest exponents of the theme of life and death, the sound interpreters of destiny, are those martyrs themselves who see beyond death and who brave all manner of opprobrium, and even a condemnation to death, to de- clare what they see and believe and what is absolutely required of men to conform to the truth. Those who follow closest these stal- wart souls can, in imitation of their masters, give up something of what ordinary men consider to be the whole good of life-these i84 [VOL. L.</page><page sequence="24">No. 2.] REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN have been able to tell the martyr's story and interpret its meaning, and their interpretations are the sources of genuine history. The knowledge of history, however, has become an object of general research and it is usually fashioned by men of different mould who by their scientific training fear poesy as fiction and guard themselves against any personal concern and try in every way to present the course of events in terms of men in their ordinary character. Yet their story has to be interesting as well as in ac- cordance with fact, for it cannot be commonplace. If there is anything extraordinary portrayed, it tends not to be goodness but greatness, considered apart from goodness and measured by the great works done through the employment of arms and men and not by the greater workings of the spirit. It seems that for the sake of our present knowledge of man and history we need to form a moral philosophy. It has often been said that, as heirs of the civilisation of the Greeks and of the reli- gion of the Jewish and Christian peoples, we have the ethical problem of reconciling the two sets of values thus inherited. We are only possessed, however, of an unstable mixture of allegiances which causes perplexity and indecision, or else makes us veer to unreasonable extremes. Consider the order of ideas in the Greek wisdom and their places in our present ethos. It was only after Socrates had made the soul of man the chief concern that Plato exalted the State as supreme over man existing in community, and that whole ensuing Platonic philosophy had its centre and aim in the Good, to which supreme Being both man and the State were subordinate. The search for knowledge of the supreme Good was the organising principle of values. But now, long afterwards, when men have ceased to kindle to the ideal of a life in an intellectual search for that highest Good, they are left warming themselves with a derivative idealisation of the State which cannot sustain them even in this life. Again, religion has exalted the human per- son as the only being of worth in the world, in virtue of God's infinite love and mercy, God who is, according to this view, the source of our being and of all that is worthy. Afterwards when men lose the religious knowledge of God they are left clinging desperately to a doctrine of the absolute value of themselves, sometimes claiming the unlimited right to their self-development I85</page><page sequence="25">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW and failing to recognise that "the individual" means all individuals and requires that a right must be a universal right, according to a supreme law for all. When others confront the chaos of such egoistic self-assertion they turn to authority, as their Good, and be- ing themselves of no greater wisdom or faith than the others they clamor for the State as the saviour of man. The excesses of these authoritarians provoke others to another extreme of individualism where they disallow any value to the State or even disavow their obligations as citizens to support it. They may claim to have higher duties as men, in time of war especially, suddenly discovering that life in the political State involves the use of force, and withdraw- ing from it virtuously like the imperfect philosopher of Plato's description, behind the shelter of a strong wall. Thus men of our times oscillate between the Greek and Christian values, or rather the disorganised relics of their values. The state of opinion is one of turmoil and confusion of thought. It is possible that our problem is not a philosophical one of reconciling inherited values of the past. The task before us may be one of elemental moral decision, as when a man sees a plain duty which if he does not perform it will make his life thereafter not worth living; or else when he knows what is evil, though oth- ers may accept it, even as a good, and he stands up against it no matter what the odds. The question for us may be whether we are ready to do what Socrates did in the Crito. These personal deci- sions are the foundations of belief and philosophy. Sixteen years ago Norman Kemp Smith, in a work entitled Prolegomena to an Idealist Theory of Knowledge, had said that the question of our day was "whether spiritual values can be credited as operating on a more than planetary, that is, on a cosmic scale" (p.4). There was little doubt as to their role in the world of man, for he pointed out that the opposite school, the naturalistic philosophers, "are certainly no less insistent in maintaining that the criteria yielded by spiritual values exercise a predominating influence in human affairs". Agreeing on this assumption philoso- phers have not concerned themselves much with moral philosophy. They have taken their arguments, where all arguments must, in- deed, eventually go, to the heights of metaphysics. They have rea- soned about the shape of a world that has to be characterised by I86 [VOL. L.</page><page sequence="26">No. 2.] REFLECTIONS ON THE SPIRIT OF MAN I87 two such disparate modes of being as value and existence. They are still searching for perfect understanding of it, with a fidelity worthy of the disciples of Plato. Meanwhile the matters that they have been taking for granted in their metaphysics are brought into question, precisely in "human affairs". Now men are really wondering whether justice is real or merely a name for whatever prevails through force or guile, whether obligation is a valid idea or only the disguised notion of advantage, whether sacrifice for the love of anything other than oneself is anything but foolishness. They are wondering and in that wonder is the place to begin our contemporary philosophy. Here is work for Socrates, or some other who can lead men to wisdom or righteousness through the spirit.
