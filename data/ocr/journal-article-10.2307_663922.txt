<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art in Arnhem Land. A. P. ELKIN and CATHERINE and RONALD BERNDT. (xii, 123 pp., 1 map, 21 plates, $7.00. The University of Chicago Press, 1950.) For those interested in the anthropology, sociology, or art of Australia, or in any aspect of primitive art, this book is of genuine value. It is another revelation of the importance of Australian material. The book is the result of field work in Arnhem Land by the three authors. The first and last chapters are by Dr. Elkin, and the main portion of the text was edited by him from first drafts presented by Dr. and Mrs. Berndt. The initial chapter provides a setting into which the art of this region fits. It includes a brief resum6 of aboriginal Australian culture and art and concludes with a cryptic summary of the "Art Regions of Australia." The concluding chapter considers the results and the problems posed by this study and offers a hope for the future development of art in this area. Chapters II through VIII deal exclusively with Arnhem Land. The country, the tribes and their organization, and the basic cultural characteristics, including the mythology, sacred symbols, magic, and their important relationship to the art, are treated in some detail. The description and interpretation of the art forms discussed are carefully and pains- takingly handled. The presentation of the material is both expository and interpreta- tive. The art of Arnhem Land has to a large extent been thought of in recent years as bark paintings. But many years ago attention was called to other forms, particularly by Sir Baldwin Spencer in his "The Native Tribes of the Northern Territory of Aus- tralia." The majority of these, however, were geometric carvings. The important dis- closure by the book under review is that the art of Arnhem Land also includes sculptured anthropomorphic forms and actual representations of human forms. A number of these are wooden carved and painted full-length figures, and heads in the round, while others are graphic depictions of human, animal, and fantastic forms on flat surfaces. Many of these are painted on bark, some so extremely conventionalized as to be practically abstract. The present study concentrates on the northeastern part of the Arnhem Land Area. It includes many art forms not previously discussed in any adequate way and stresses certain forms not before given sufficient significance. Of particular importance is the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 249 presentation of carved and painted wooden sculptures of human figures about three feet high and heads about life-size, both previously unknown in Australian art. The full significance and content of these carvings, sacred, totemic, religious, ritual, and secular are made vividly clear. It is of considerable interest to know that in this part of Australia there was continual and prolonged c6ntact with Indonesia (Macassar in the Celebes in particular) and some contact with the Torres Straits islands to the north- east. It is also likely, on the basis of the style of the wooden figures, that there was some contact with the nearby coastal area of New Guinea. The totemically painted human skulls and their wooden substitutes, body painting, bark painting, the decoration of secular objects, such as pipes and baskets, are all considered and described as they developed in Arnhem Land. It is especially noteworthy that the artist, his position in his society and the controls and motivations of his art are given full consideration. Art in Arnhem Land is therefore strongly recommended to anthropologists and to all who are interested in primitive art. It perhaps falls somewhat short in its char- acterization of the art, but the good photographs of the objects discussed and the careful and complete description of them and their meaning and function make this a book of major importance.
