Gray Sweeney Asher B. Durand, Kindred Spirits (detail), 1849. Oil on canvas, 46 x 36 in. New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox, and Tilden Foundations When Sanford R. Gifford's Hunter Mountain, Twilight was shown at the National Academy of Design on 7 May 1866, one critic provoca- tively noted, "We do not associate the idea of the nude with land- scape painting and mountain forms, but we must use it in our judgement of Mr. Gifford's very beautiful 'Twilight.' ... In that pic- ture he really has had to treat the nude of landscape scenery, and he has done it like an artist sure of himself" (fig. 1).1 Though virtually unnoticed by modern historians of nineteenth-century American land- scape painting, the hidden ico- nology this critic so astutely per- ceived in Gifford's masterpiece drew on a tradition of vitalistic na- ture symbolism that was readily understood by Gifford (1823- 1880) and his Hudson River school contemporaries, who be- lieved that nature could be vital- ized and spiritualized through the use of anthropomorphic symbols, or emblematic personifications.2 These artists imbued critically im- portant details with certain pat- terns of form and meaning, which had a major source in the allegor- ical imagery of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century emblem, or de- votional, books.3 When examined, this code of anthropomorphic symbolism helps to reveal the full complexity and subtlety of Hudson River school painting and its sig- nificance within a historical con- text. Such a study revivifies an important artistic convention in mid-nineteenth-century American landscape painting. The nature and source of these anthropomorphic symbols are clearly apparent in the works of Thomas Birch (1787-1851) and Thomas Cole (1801-1848). An early and incontrovertible ex- ample of a direct, one-on-one link between an emblem book proto- type and nineteenth-century painted imagery is recognizable in Thomas Birch's The Rescue (fig. 2). In Birch's picture, a prominent rocky cliff looms impassively above the shipwrecked sailors at the bottom right. Etched into the rock is a craggy face that bears a grim, even menacing, expression. Yet this effect was not taken from nature, as evidenced by the paint- ing's striking resemblance to a small printed emblem (fig. 3) that appeared in one of the many edi- tions of the book Emblems Divine and Moral by Francis Quarles (1592-1644).4 In this emblem source for Birch's painting, the profiled face in the rock, which looks toward the sinking ship on the horizon, gradually reveals it- self, complete with forehead, nose, eyesockets, mouth, and chin. As was typical of emblem prints such as this, the head discernible in the cliff features hair in the form of shaggy bushes that drape over the face's forehead, an aspect of the visage that Birch chose to omit. Quarles's book was reprinted in numerous pirated versions throughout the eighteenth and 43 Smithsonian Studies in American Art</page><page sequence="3">1 Sanford R.

Terra Museum of American Art, Chicago early nineteenth centuries, and as students of European painting are aware, its illustrations served many purposes for European artists. Equally important is the conten- tion that the use of this particular emblem book was widespread among artists of the Hudson River school.5 Despite its popularity, the em- blem book was only one source for the anthropomorphic forms that artists used to personify na- ture. Paradoxically, during the ro- mantic period, nature was often perceived as imitating art. This predilection is evident in the names given to countless geolog- ical formations by early explorers, who likened them to such archi- tectural structures as cathedrals, castles, and monuments. Rarer and even more renowned were geo- logical formations that evoked as- sociations with the human form. The Old Stone Face, discovered in the early 1800s at Franconia Notch in New Hampshire, is among the most famous American examples of this phenomenon. Thomas Cole was among the first artists to sketch the profile during a visit in 1828 (fig. 4). In his diary he wrote, "Over the [lake] presides the Old Man of the Mountain (as the country people call it) a sin- gular crag that has the features of a man strongly marked in colossal dimensions."6 The Old Stone Face had an enormous impact on the imagination of Cole, who was probably already aware of the em- blem image and was searching for ways to animate and humanize the wilderness landscapes of America. One of the plates of William Oakes's Scenery of the White Mountains graphically traces the multiple perspectives that lead to the single correct vantage point for viewing the Old Stone Face's noble profile (fig. 5). Oakes's plate supports the belief that such forms could be best viewed only from a single perspective, which, when found, allowed the "pathetic fal- lacy" decried by John Ruskin to induce a momentary suspension 44 Fall 1989</page><page sequence="4">2 Thomas Birch, The Rescue, 1837.

Romantic artists on both sides of the Atlantic were at- tuned to associationist aesthetics and willing to indulge in the pleasures of pathetic fallacy by personifying rocks, trees, clouds, and mountains.7 The mid-nine- teenth-century belief that nature was a revelation of the Creator's handiwork did little to discourage such indulgences. Of the Old Man of the Mountain, as the Old Stone Face came to be known, a writer for The Knickerbocker observed in 1852: I started! From the topmost peak of the loftiest of the summits a human yet god-like countenance was looking down upon me.... Such a scene, and the unexpected manifestation of this superhuman presence, was at once startling and sublime. ... I now saw that it was the far-famed "Profile" which towered up before me in solitary grandeur.8 The notoriety of the Old Man of the Mountain, later paired with the nearby Lady of Franconia Notch, directed attention to sev- eral other humanlike formations in both America and Europe.9 In England artists and poets had long been intrigued by such crags as the Sphinx Rock overlooking Wast Water in the Lake District, the so- called Pitt's Head on the south coast, and the head-shaped Welsh Profile on the coast of Wales. As- sociations were taken even further in America, where local geograph- ical lore commonly associated entire mountains with sleeping giants or recumbent animals. Among the most noted was the Catskill Mountains' Sleeping Giant, observed by travelers as they navi- gated the Hudson River from a point just south of the village of Catskill, where Thomas Cole es- tablished his studio in the 1830s. So great was the celebrity of these distinctive natural formations that Nathaniel Hawthorne used one as the model for the control- ling metaphor in his allegorical tale "The Great Stone Face," among his collection of short sto- ries that appeared in The Snow Image (1851). Although the Great Stone Face was the presiding spirit of the story's valley setting, some characters "possessed the gift of distinguishing this grand natural phenomenon more perfectly than many of their neighbors."

Published in William Oakes, Scenery of the White Mountains (Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1848), pl. 10 The Great Stone Face, then, was a work of Nature in her mood of majestic playfulness, formed on the perpendicular side of a moun- tain by some immense rocks, which had been thrown together in such a position as, when viewed at a proper distance, precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance. It seemed as if an enormous giant, or Titan, had sculptured his own likeness on the precipice ... and the farther [the spectator] withdrew from [the rocks], the more like a human face, with all its original divinity intact, did they appear; until, as it grew dim in the distance, with the clouds and glorified vapor of the mountains clustering about it, the Great Stone Face seemed positively to be alive. 1 In this description Hawthorne distills the essence of the visual tradition of emblematic personifi- cation: the anthropomorphized natural form suggests a divine presence, it is alive, its presence can often only be seen from one position, and only a chosen few can perceive it. Hawthorne's story vividly expresses the widespread perception of such natural forms as silent witnesses to the course of history, a vision that also power- fully informed the iconography of Cole's series The Course of Empire. The singular frontispiece design of collector John Ludlow Morton's (1792-1871) Sketchbook, an album of small drawings by many of the artists of the 1820s, strongly sug- gests the pervasive awareness of anthropormorphic emblem book imagery among American artists at this time (fig. 6). Morton, an ama- teur artist, drew a landscape for his frontispiece, the key element of which is a cliff that borrowed directly from the emblem tradi- tion. Inscribed on the bluff's pro- filed face, complete with bushes arranged as hair hanging down over the forehead, are the names of Thomas Cole, Asher B. Durand (1796-1886), and many other early artists of the Hudson River school. It was Thomas Cole, however, who boldly introduced the ico- nography of anthropomorphic em- blems into American landscape painting as he sought new ways to vitalize and humanize nature. Cole 46 Fall 1989</page><page sequence="6">6 Frontispiece to John Ludlow Morton's Sketchbook, 1826. Pencil on paper, 81/8 x 7 in. (sheet). New-York Historical Society knew of the personified-rock em- blem device (see fig. 3) as early as 1826, when he incorporated it into the foreground of his Daniel Boone at His Cabin at Great Osage Lake (Amherst College). He used this emblem of personifica- tion repeatedly throughout his ca- reer, greatly enlarging its potential to express sentiment. In fact, in his often-stated quest to elevate landscape painting to the impor- tance of history painting, Cole consciously expanded the idea of personification to include not only rocks but also a wide range of nat- ural forms, including trees, clouds, and mountains.1 Cole's descrip- tion of trees vividly illustrates the expanded application of emblem iconography: My attention has often been at- tracted by the appearance of action and expression of sur- rounding objects, especially trees. They spring from some resem- blance to human form. There is an expression of affection in inter- twining branches. ... [Trees] as- similate with each other inform and character. Expose them to ad- versity and agitations, and a thou- sand original characters start forth, battling for existence or supremacy. 12 Several of Cole's early drawings of trees captured his vitalistic per- ception of an animated nature that is both divine and evil. One ex- ample is annotated, "Root looking like a devil" (1825-26, Detroit In- stitute of Arts), while others depict trees with branches intertwined in gestures of arborescent affection.13 Especially in his religious works, such as The Angels Ministering to Christ in the Wilderness (1843, Worcester Art Museum), trees assume the role of dramatic per- sonae.14 In that painting, the tor- tured face discernible in the knot of the tree trunk behind Christ reinforces the idea of demonic forces in the landscape. In his Landscape Composition, St. John the Baptist in the Wilder- ness, Cole cunningly shapes the profile of the gravity-defying, rocky pulpit on which the Baptist stands into a human visage-the focus of the painting's composi- tion and iconography (figs. 7, 8) 47 Smithsonian Studies in American Art</page><page sequence="7">7 Thomas Cole, Landscape Composition, St.John the Baptist in the Wilderness, 1827.

As mute witness to the Baptist's prophecy of a savior, the anthropomorphic rock is one of several rocks in the composition, including the huge, domed mono- lith in the distance, that represent natural actors in the animated drama of divine history. Similar symbolic forms prevail in other early works by Cole.15 The expressive power of such emblematic personifications of na- ture-images of the Deity's pres- ence and intervention in the un- folding historical drama of the world-became a pervasive fea- ture of Cole's complex style of landscape painting and elicited profound spiritual sentiments. No- where is this more evident than in Cole's series The Course of Em- pire, The Voyage of Life, and his last, unfinished The Cross and the World. In the five panels of The Course of Empire, Cole repre- sented the history of a nation from its birth to its death, alluding to America's self-proclaimed manifest destiny and advancing the belief that nature and history reveal great moral lessons.16 Virtually the 48 Fall 1989</page><page sequence="8">8 Landscape Composition, St. John the Baptist in the Wilderness (detail) 9 Thomas Cole, The Voyage of Life: Childhood, 1842.

In the final picture of the series, Desolation, the moun- tain's impassive profile emerges most vividly as it presides over the tragic wreck of a ruined city. In The Voyage of Life series, Cole subtly used emblems as nat- ural markers denoting the travel- er's movement through the land- scapes that represent the stages of his life journey. Of Childhood, Cole wrote, "The dark cavern is emblematic of our earthly origin, and the mysterious past.... The rosy light of morning, the luxu- riant flowers are emblems of the joyousness of early life" (fig. 9).

The second painting, Youth, continues to re- joice in life's promise, as conveyed by Cole's description, "The beau- tiful stream flows directly toward the aerial palace ... emblematic of the daydreams of youth, its aspira- tions after glory and fame."17 In Manhood, however, Cole paints a stormy, cloud-enshrouded landscape, in which "bare im- pending precipices rise in the lurid light, demon forms are hov- ering in the air ... and the rocks and trees riven by tempest are the allegory" (fig. 10). Here rocky heights, which in Childhood are in benign repose, strain with fear and writhe with tortured expres- sions. The rocky head at the center looks down from its pre- cipice to the seething cataract the voyager is destined to enter. At right, a tree contorted in agony mimics the suffering of the trav- eler. In the clouds loom the faces of Suicide, Intemperance, and Murder, the temptations, Cole said, "that beset men in their direst trouble" (fig. 11). These airy cloud emblems set the precedent for the veiled symbolism that Cole's followers later achieved through cloud imagery."8 Old Age, the final picture of the series, depicts the voyager en- tering a portentous scene, with clouds brooding over a vast mid- night ocean (fig. 12). The rock be- hind him, now battered and remi- niscent of a sunken skull, mirrors the old man's decrepitude and storm-wrecked shallop. In Old Age, as he had consistently done in the other three paintings of the series, Cole used the expressive presence of anthropomorphic em- blems to underscore the formal and symbolic end of the traveler's life voyage, prompting a writer for the New-York Commercial Adver- tiser to praise, "There are more than volumes in these pictures. There is a depth of meaning in each that is revealed but never fathomed, though one sits and studies hour after hour.''9 During the last decade of his ca- reer, Cole dramatically increased his use of anthropomorphic em- blems, refining their role in cre- ating the expression of sentiment. The Cross in the Wilderness, Cole's late work of 1845, particularly re- veals his enriched repertoire of 50 Fall 1989</page><page sequence="10">11 Thomas Cole, The Voyage of Life: Manhood (detail) 12 Thomas Cole, The Voyage of Life: Old Age, 1842.

Its image of a man-made stone cross entwined with vines and bathed in a halo of sunlight provided Frederic Edwin Church (1826- 1900), Sanford Gifford, and others with an important precedent for religious iconography.

As a major image of the American spir- itual wilderness, The Cross in the Wilderness later wielded consider- able influence. Cole completed the painting just prior to his last series, The Cross and the World. Cole's romantic imagination, as well as his religious leaning, dis- posed him to see architectural and anthropomorphic forms in clouds. Although the phantoms of Man- hood and the cloud fantasy in 51 Smithsonian Studies in American Art</page><page sequence="11">13 Thomas Cole, The Cross in the Wilderness, 1845. Oil on canvas, circle 28 in. in diameter, Musee du Louvre Youth are the best known exam- ples, several of Cole's drawings also suggest this habit of mind, including the elaborate sketch Cloud Land (mid 1840s, Detroit Institute of Arts), which depicts a figure staring at tiers of billowing clouds shaped into architectural and human forms. The drawing Sky Near Volterra (ca. 1841-42, Detroit Institute of Arts), with its huge, human-shaped cloud, also testifies to the artist's fascination with celestial personifications. The perception of fantastic ar- chitectural and anthropomorphic forms in clouds was a common diversion in nineteenth-century American culture. In the 1840s and 1850s popular literary maga- zines like The Knickerbocker fre- quently contained poems cele- brating the image of clouds as forms of grand architecture and symbols of celestial divinity. Jasper F. Cropsey (1823-1900), in his ar- ticle "Up Among the Clouds," de- scribed clouds as "grand masses of dreamy forms floating by each other, sometimes looking like magic places, rising higher and higher ... as though it were a spirit world of its own. ... In boy- hood, we have often watched this dream-world, and peopled it with angels."20 Although this associa- tionist inclination typically in- formed the kind of sublime im- agery found in such works as Church's masterpiece Twilight in the Wilderness, it also occasionally inspired imagery with nationalistic meaning. An overt example of the latter is Thomas P. Rossiter's paint- ing Visit of the Prince of Wales, President Buchanan and Digni- taries to the Tomb of Washington at Mount Vernon, October, 1860 (fig. 14).

The most im- portant work of this period was the unfinished series The Cross and the World, which influenced numerous artists in the 1850s and 1860s. When these paintings were displayed at the memorial exhibi- tion of Cole's works in 1848, they forcefully transmitted many of the iconographic devices he had per- fected, especially in regard to em- blematic symbols. Essential to the series' effectiveness were Cole's studied compositional arrange- ments of emblem images, which underscored the emblems' role of overseeing and mirroring the plight of the two pilgrims-one of the cross and the other of the world. In The Pilgrim of the Cross at the End of His Journey (1847, National Museum of American Art), the most celebrated work in the series, a rock and cloudlike form dividing the picture's center are expressively contrived to re- semble the lower part of a great head that looks in the same literal and spiritual direction as the pil- grim. By contrast, the doomed figure in The Pilgrim of the World at the End of His Journey is over- shadowed by huge, rocky huma- noid forms, whose expressions of despair and anguish, like the rocks animating The Voyage of Life: Manhood, grimly emphasize the pilgrim's mistake in choosing the worldly path (fig. 15). Cole's premature death in 1848 inspired the creation of at least two memorial paintings using em- blematic personification. The first of these, To the Memory of Cole (1848, Des Moines Women's Club, Iowa), by Cole's greatest student, Frederic Church, is a brilliant and original synthesis of naturalism and emblematic symbolism based on Church's intimate knowledge of Cole's achievements.22 Asher B. Durand followed Church's lead with his Kindred Spirits almost a year later (fig. 16). In comparison to Church's To the Memory of Cole, Durand's well-known Kindred Spirits is a much more conventional painting, although it possesses classic anthropomorphic emblems in the two facial profiles that outline the rocky cliffs on the right. The more distant rock pro- file is completely faithful to the emblem book prototype and in- cludes the prescribed shrubbery hair, pursed lips, and nose. The nearer one, with its open mouth, appears to utter a mournful cry at the passing of Cole.23 Cole's strong influence on Church is evident in the latter's 53 Smithsonian Studies in American Art</page><page sequence="13">15 Thomas Cole, study for The Pilgrim of the World at the End of His Journey, 1846-47, from the series The Cross and the World.

This alle- gorical painting possesses a strong resemblance to Cole's lost work Pilgrim of the Cross on His Journey in its replication of the emblem rock profile on the far right (fig. 18). The tree at left, suggestive of Cole at his finest, gestures with tortured expressive- ness toward the pillar of fire on the horizon. A critic for Literary World alluded to other associa- tions in this precocious work: If the idea is original with this promising young artist, who is or has been a pupil of Cole's, it enti- tled him to great credit. ... The demon-cloud hovering over the 'everlasting fire," in the bosom of the abyss, is a conception worthy of [Henry] Fuseli.24 The critic may not have realized that Church's "demon-cloud" owed a fundamental debt to the winged "phantom of glory" in Cole's Pilgrim of the World at the End of His Journey (see fig. 14), which Church first saw in his teacher's studio. In his Twilight, Short Arbiter 'twixt Day and Night (fig. 19), Church again directly borrowed emblem imagery from Cole's Pil- grim of the Cross on His Journey (see fig. 18). The most obvious parallels are the cantilevered rock with the emblem profile at right and the sky's highly charged light. Its role is suggested by the paint- ing's title, an allusion to the lines in John Milton's Paradise Lost de- scribing Satan's return to earth to sow the seeds of discord in the Garden of Eden. The very pres- ence of an emblem profile in such a tranquil scene-one that suc- cessfully transfers Cole's program 54 Fall 1989</page><page sequence="14">16 Asher B. Durand, Kindred Spirits, 1849. Oil on canvas, 46 x 36 in. New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox, and Tilden Foundations of expressive symbolism to a pure landscape-hints at the possibility for disruption. In his three masterpieces of the early 1860s-The Icebergs, Cotopaxi, and Twilight in the Wilderness-Church painted epic landscapes of ice, fire, and the fir- mament. All three works are filled with hidden anthropomorphic symbolism that significantly con- tributes to their meaning. The Ice- bergs (1861, Dallas Museum of Fine Arts) reveals how ingeniously Church expanded and refined the tradition of emblematic personifi- cation that Cole helped define (see fig. 1 of "Frederic Church's The Icebergs: Erratic Boulders and Time's Slow Changes"). Gerald L. Carr has perceptively observed that Church's great arctic picture contains a weird profile face in the cliff at right and a shimmering animallike image in the iceberg's central dome.25 Another profile face on the extreme left is an al- most exact copy of the emblem book prototype, and a skull- shaped rock lies just below. That the shape of the rock sitting peril- ously above the ice grotto recalls a form often seen in Cole's land- scapes is not mere coincidence. Cotopaxi abounds with com- plex veiled symbolism (figs. 20, 21). On viewing Cotopaxi, a writer for The Albion declared, "We sur- 55 Smithsonian Studies in American Art</page><page sequence="15">17 Frederic Edwin Church, Christian on the Borders of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, Pilgrim's Progress, 1847.

The London Art Journal thought Cotopaxi to be "a scene of strange solemn magnificence. ... And in these vapors of various kinds, there are magical feats of the pencil such as we cannot remember seeing equalled." Through his rendering of smoke, Church made full iconographic use of the hidden cloud emblem in Coto- paxi. At the exact center of the composition, the profile of a face emerges in the smoke-filled sky between the erupting volcano and the sun. This great face, which looks toward the volcano, appears to be a phantasmagoric South American Indian head. Although the exact meaning that Church as- cribed to this figure remains elu- sive, the artist probably intended to elicit associations with ancient Incan gods or spirits whose dark presence provided a dramatic con- trast with the Christian symbolism of the sun's light. Cotopaxi's In- dian iconography, however, was not restricted to the skies. On the right side of the volcano's base, Church depicted the profile of the Head of the Inca, a geological for- mation that was widely recognized by visitors to Cotopaxi.26 Looking straight up, its serrated profile bears an uncanny resemblance to the emblem book prototype. It is hardly surprising that a landscape conceived on such an epic scale and in the era of the Civil War contained diverse im- agery, some of perhaps a more private nature. At the time Church painted Cotopaxi, a rival to him had appeared on the New York art scene in the person of Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902). Both men aspired to be "monarchs of land- scape painting" through their epic- sized landscapes. Imbedded near the crown of Cotopaxi's cone, just above the Head of the Inca, is Church's visual response to the upstart from Dusseldorf: a three- quarters-perspective self-portrait, distinctly resembling the portrait his father had commissioned of him in 1866. This mustached per- sonification appears to be a cun- ning self-proclamation of the artist as a figure who towers above all his artistic rivals, especially Bierstadt, just as mighty Cotopaxi towered above other mountains.27 Church's Twilight in the Wilder- ness has long been understood as the most compelling image of the artist's preoccupation with the na- tional landscape (figs. 22, 23). It is a pivotal work in which Church culminated his thematic study of the wilderness sunset as a reflec- tion of the face of God. Although the painting's most obvious source harked back to a spectacular sunset Church observed over New York City in 1858, the artist's fasci- 56 Fall 1989</page><page sequence="16">19 Frederic Edwin Church, Twilight, Short Arbiter 'twixt Day and Night, 1850.

Scudder Bequest Fund nation with the American land- scape was also reinforced by the regional and political acrimony preceding the Civil War. In fact, in Our Banner in the Sky (1861, Olana Historic Site), painted the next year, Church even trans- formed his landscape's sunset sky into the image of a tattered Amer- ican flag. The meaning of Twilight in the Wilderness, however, is far more subtle and complex, incor- porating an intricate iconographic program in which emblematic personification plays a central role.28 In the opinion of his contem- poraries, Church's exact handling of details and his brilliant use of Turnerian color marked Twilight in the Wilderness as one of his "Great Pictures." It was perceived as a "scene unhistoric, with no other interest than that of a wil- derness, without human associa- tions of any kind."29 The picture disposed the spectator to "dreamy and contemplative [thoughts]; it is 'Nature with folded hands, kneel- ing at her evening prayer."'30 In- deed, to a viewer thus inclined, religious symbolism informs even the smallest detail. The tree stump in the left foreground, for ex- ample, symbolizes a wilderness altar, complete with a cross made of tiny wood splinters. This small but critically significant cruciform detail points skyward, directing at- tention to the three trees on the right-symbols of the three crosses on Calvary, an allusion Church used before in his 1848 memorial to Cole. The themes of worldly suffering and heavenly re- demption are the essence of the trees' meaning. Only the tall ever- green, a common symbol of im- mortality, reaches toward the light. The deciduous tree, in the full glory of its autumnal tints, will soon lose its leaves with winter's arrival, while the blasted tree in the foreground contorts its branches in a dance of death. A fallen snag at the base of these trees forms a natural cross on a larger scale, complementing the iconography on the left. It is the sky that is the most expressively charged aspect of Church's work. Although the land- scape's brilliant red light and ce- lestial figures have a source in Cole's Voyage of Life: Manhood, they are not emblematic of a single man's ordeal; rather, Church transformed them into ra- diant symbols for the nation on the brink of a calamitous civil war. 57 Smithsonian Studies in American Art</page><page sequence="17">20 Frederic Edwin Church, Cotopaxi, 1862.

Cole had written emotionally of sunset as "that scene so wildly grand, / Spreading its empurpled wings ... that blessed hour when Angels hovering in Crimson Clouds commune with man."31 John Ruskin, that arbiter of taste who was a major influence on Church, described sunsets like armies of angels... covering the east and the west with the waving of their wings, and robing the gloom of thefarther infinite with a vesture of divers [sic] colors of which the threads are purple and scarlet, and the embroideries flame. In the ordinance of the fir- mament God means us to ac- knowledge his own immediate presence.32 One particularly insightful critic praised Church's Twilight in the Wilderness for having successfully fulfilled Ruskin's call to acknowl- edge God's presence in the ordi- nance of the firmament: Solitude reigns over the scene, and as the eye ever turns away from the wilderness below to gaze upon the brilliant canopy of the sky, the imagination whispers that he who was once "led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted," must often have turned his gaze from the gloom and loneliness of the forest to the brightness and beauty of those heavens which to his vision offaith were ever opened, revealing the 'Father of Lights."33 David Huntington has sug- gested that the small cloud di- rectly aligned with the diagonal stump at left evokes associations with the "Dove of the Holy Spirit."34 The compositional line that extends from the stump through the cloudlet intersects with a curiously formed cloud with three holes pierced in it, rep- resentative of the face of the Creator, the "Father of Lights."35 For Americans of the 1860s, at least for those attuned with what the Bible described as "eyes to see and minds to understand," Tuwilight in the Wilderness repre- sented the ultimate manifestation of nature as God's church and holy book, making it the essential painting of the decade. Clearly, there seems to be little 58 Fall 1989</page><page sequence="18">21 Cotopaxi (detail) 22 Frederic Edwin Church, Twilight in the Wilderness, 1860. Oil on canvas, 40 x 64 in. Cleveland Museum of Art, Mr. and Mrs. William H. Marlatt Fund 23 Twilight in the Wilderness (detail) debate that Cole and Church, through their complex and subtle adaptations, refined the tradition of emblematic personification to express a vitalistic vision of nature. What still remains in question, however, is the meaning of "the nude of landscape scenery," first applied to Sanford Gifford's Hunter Mountain, Twilight. Though Gifford employed an iconography not unlike that of his mentor Cole and his contem- porary Church, he depicted a far different view of nature. It is a nature plainly marked by man's often destructive imprint, yet it itself is a personification on the grandest scale. Gifford's Hunter Mountain, Twilight depicts a despoiled virgin wilderness, scarred by "the rav- ages of the axe" and the psychic wounds of the recent Civil War.36 Despite its somber feeling, the distant mountain and sky posit a different sentiment. The sickle arc of the rising moon, long associ- ated with Christ and the Resurrec- tion, and the tiny crosslike form of the evening star convey associa- tions of immortality. But it is ulti- mately the mountain that is the most arresting form in the work. Spanning the full width of the canvas, it represents, on a literal level, the formidable barrier to further agricultural expansion to the West. Given the prevailing vi- talistic vision of nature and the common perception of mountain forms as sleeping giants, however, it seems hardly surprising that Gifford painted Hunter Mountain to resemble an immense recum- bent nude female figure-a meta- phor for a living Mother Earth threatened by man's intrusions. The funeral eulogy for John F. Kensett provides one final poign- ant example of this vitalistic con- ception of nature. In his eulogy, the Reverend Samuel Osgood de- scribed the way his neighbor Kensett had depicted the rocks of Newport, where the artist had a summer house. Delivered in a manner that might well have been dismissed as sentimental Victorian- era rhetoric were it not for the period's acceptance of anthropo- morphic symbolism, Osgood's eulogy suggested that Kensett's rocks were more than direct tran- scriptions from nature: The rocks in our neighborhood are frequent and characteristic. He [Kensett] has not treated the most remarkable of them, but he has sought the more quiet and sooth- ing rather than the weird and ex- 59 Smithsonian Studies in American Art</page><page sequence="19">citing; but he has rendered them in a wonderful way. Under his touch we see the marvel of the Egyptian sands reappearing on the shore of our great Sound, and that stone looks upon you with the face of the Sphinx. That rock whis- pers to you the secret of earth, and sea, and sky. Its surface speaks out the mysterious life of nature, which glows in that rich color like blood in the cheek; and those stains, and seams, and mosses, are the impressions which ages have left upon that stony face under the changes of the air, and water and light. This Sphinx means more than we can understand, and her features and look so faithfully re- port her colloquy for thousands of years with the sea and the winds.37 Several other major nineteenth- century American artists-Jasper F. Notes The concept of my paper originated with my dissertation, "Artist-Explorers of the American West," and was refined in three symposia held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978, 1979, and 1980. I am indebted to David Huntington for en- couraging me to explore anthropomorphic symbolism in the art of Cole and Church and for providing his learned counsel; Gerald L. Carr and Jeremy Adamson, for sharing important insights on Church's an- thropomorphic imagery; Roger B. Stein and Alan Wallach, for sharing their knowl- edge of the emblem book tradition; and James C. Moore and Robert Mugeraurer, for their thoughtful advice. I was also stim- ulated by Robert Rosenblum's writings on the Northern Tradition; H. W. Janson's pi- oneering article "The Image Made by Chance in Renaissance Painting"; Paul Shepard's provocative study Man in the Landscape; and Ronald Paulson's work with emblems in English art. Arizona State Uni- versity assisted me in completing this study with research time and support. 1 Review of the 1866 exhibition at the National Academy of Design in the New York Commercial Advertiser, 7 May 1866, p. 2. Unfortunately, the identity of the critic for the Advertiser Cropsey, Martin J. Heade (1819- 1904), Albert Bierstadt, and Thomas Moran (1837-1926)-and numerous minor painters con- tinued to explore the tradition of vitalistic nature symbolism and its many layers of associations that Cole had helped to define. In fact, identification of the emblem pro- file or any one of its variants has become a kind of litmus test for determining the degree of an ar- tist's affiliation with the landscape conventions of the Hudson River school.38 This renewed awareness of anthropomorphic personifica- tion not only recaptures a lost di- mension of meaning in mid- nineteenth-century American land- scape painting, but also challenges the way nature itself is commonly perceived by a twentieth-century society.39 remains mysterious. His fascinating use of language, which I contend links Gifford's work to the vitalistic vision of nature and the emblem tradition, raises questions about the meaning of the term nude in this context. The use of the word-fraught with associations and italicized as a term of critical as- sessment-elicits an interpretation that transcends its casual use within the standard vocabulary. On the one hand, the term might imply a type of partic- ularly difficult or august subject. How- ever, because of the term's connection with "landscape painting and moun- tain forms," it must be seen here as evoking associations of the land with the body-vulnerable or even seduc- tive. I would like to thank Gerald L. Carr for bringing this review to my attention. 2 This vitalistic concept of anthropo- morphic nature is readily apparent in a description of spring in Henry David Thoreau's Walden and Civil Disobedi- ence, Owen Thomas, ed. (New York: W. W. Norton, 1966), pp. 201-204: Few phenomena gave me more delight than to observe the forms which thauing clay assume in flowing douwn 60 Fall 1989</page><page sequence="20">the sides of a deep cut on the railroad through which I passed on my way to the village. ... I am affected as if in a peculiar sense I stood in the labora- tory of the Artist who made the world and me,-had come to where he was still at work, sporting on this bank, and with excess energy strewing his fresh designs about. Ifeel as if I were nearer to the vitals of the globe.... Thus it seemed that this one hillside il- lustrated the principle of all the opera- tions of nature.... The earth is not a mere fragment of dead history, stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a book, to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly, but living po- etry likes the leaves of a tree, which precede flowers and fruit,-not fossil earth, but a living earth compared with whose great central life all an- imal and vegetable life is merely parasitic. 3 Roland E. Fleischer's recent study "Emblems in Colonial American Painting" discusses the prevalence of emblems in colonial portraiture and observes that the emblematic tradition, which had peaked in Europe during the seventeenth century, found its fullest expression in America during the eighteenth century; see American Art Journal 20, no. 3 (1988): 2-35. However, there is much evidence that the emblem tradition was still useful to the landscape painters of ante- bellum America. The standard study of emblem books is Rosemary Freeman, English Emblem Books (London: Chatto and Windus, 1948). See also Mario Praz, Studies in Seventeenth-Century Im- agery, 3d ed. (Rome: Edizione Di Storia E Letteratura, 1975), pp. 158-61; T. O. Beachcroft, "Quarles and the Emblem Habit," Dublin Review 188 (January-June 1931): 80-96; Roger B. Stein, "Thomas Smith's Self-Portrait: Image/Text As Artifact," Art Journal (Winter 1984): 316-27; and Peter M. Daly, Emblem Theory (Nendeln, Liech- tenstein: KTO Press, 1979). Daly notes that the importance of the emblem book as a genre can hardly be overes- timated: "Well over six hundred au- thors produced in excess of two thou- sand titles, which in turn represented tens of thousands of individual em- blems. These emblem books were fre- quently reprinted in expanded form and translated into various languages. ... [Albrecht] Schone may be right when he estimated that the number of emblem books that flooded the Euro- pean market to have been a seven digit number" (p. 11). 4 Daly's Emblem Theory notes that Quarles's Emblems Divine and Moral appeared in at least forty-four editions, the first published in 1635 by G. Miller in London. A New York edition of Quarles's book appeared as late as 1854; see Francis Quarles, Emblems Divine and Moral (New York: Robert Carter, 1854). See also John Horden, Francis Quarles: A Bibliography of His Works to the Year 1880 (Oxford: Ox- ford University Press, 1953). 5 Alan Wallach first noted the impor- tance of Quarles's emblems in the work of Thomas Cole in his "The Voyage of Life as Popular Art," Art Bul- letin 59 (June 1977): 234-41. Cole's religious background in the Dissenting tradition would have made knowledge of the emblem book tradition quite probable, and Cole's later work, which owes much to John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, also supports this. Thomas Birch's awareness of the image was probably derived from two sources: the emblem book image, which is es- pecially evident in the configuration of The Rescue, and the art and prints of eighteenth-century artists like Horace Vernet, Philip de Loutherbourg, Richard Wilson, and earlier figures like Salvator Rosa. For information on Thomas Birch see William H. Gerdts, Thomas Birch 1779-1851 Paintings and Drawings (Philadelphia: Philadel- phia Maritime Museum, 1966). A review in The Knickerbocker for December 1844 observes the over- looked value of Quarles's emblem book, and a review of Christmas books in The Home Journal for 8 De- cember 1860 (p. 3) praised an edition of Quarles's book as a great favorite of Sir Joshua Reynolds, who "made careful copies of all the illustrations." 6 See Catherine H.

However, Stafford is most con- cerned with the "plain" (that is, non- anthropomorphizing) style of land- scape depiction that culminated in nineteenth-century realism. James C. Moore explored anthropomorphism in "The Storm and the Harvest" (Ph.D. diss., Indiana University, 1974); see es- pecially chap. 5, "Natural Hierarchies: Connecting Heaven and Earth." 8 "The Old Man of the Mountain," The Knickerbocker (October 1852): 284. 9 See John Michell, Natural Likeness: Faces and Figures in Nature (New York: E.

The character of his com- positions is ideal and intellectual.... The landscape charms him, not as it does his successors, because of its naked externalism, but as a ground- work of his art, which he is to quicken with human associations, or dignify and spiritualize by the subtle power of the imagination." 12 Louis Legrand Noble, The Life and Works of Thomas Cole (New York: Cornish, Lamport &amp; Co., 1853; reprint, Eliot S. Vesell, ed., Cambridge: Har- vard University Press, 1964), pp. 65-66. 13 Among the best examples of this are two early drawings inscribed "From Nature" in the New-York Historical So- ciety's collection and another drawing with an identical inscription at the Al- bany Institute. See Howard S. Merritt, To Walk with Nature: The Drawings of Thomas Cole (Yonkers, N.Y.: Hudson River Museum, 1982), especially nos. 1, 4-6, pp. 10, 12-13. 14 See William H. Gerdts, Jr., "Cole's Painting 'After the Temptation,"' Balti- more Museum Annual II (1967): 103- 111. 15 Cole's Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (1827-28, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), in which David Huntington identified the faces of Adam and Eve in a rock, is one such example; see David Huntington, "Frederic Edwin Church's Niagara: Nature and the Na- tion's Type," Texas Studies in Lan- guage and Literature 25 (Spring 1983): 115. In a fascinating drawing, inscribed "Look at This Every Side Up" and "Elijah in the Cave," in the collection of the New York State Li- brary, Albany, Cole created an image with four distinct views of landscapes that are only revealed as the drawing is physically rotated. This trick image or "conceit" dates prior to 1829 and expresses a predilection that would continue throughout Cole's career, leading to other concealed imagery, of which emblematic personification was only one aspect. 16 See Ellwood C. Parry, "Thomas Cole's 'The Course of Empire': A Study in Se- rial Imagery," (Ph.D. diss., Yale Univer- sity, 1970) and Alan Wallach, "Cole, Byron, and The Course of Empire," Art Bulletin 50 (1968): 375-79. 17 Exhibition of the Paintings of the Late Thomas Cole (New York: Snowden and Prall, 1848), pp. 6-7. This was the catalogue of the Memorial Exhibition. Cole's repeated use of the terms emblem and emblematic indicates that he was clearly aware of the emblem tradition, its practice, and most impor- tantly, a certain habit of mind. Ellwood C. Parry has pointed out in his re- cently published monograph on Cole that Herman Hugo's emblem book Pia Desideria, published in London in 1686 and again in 1690, may have pro- vided Cole with an emblem image for the figure of the traveler in Youth and Old Age.

Silver towers and minarets of massed cumulus glow with rivers of light.... This loveliest air-castle stoodfull in the east, with a background of dimly rounded cloud forms, like cherub faces which girdle the Sistine ma- donna; and when the sun neared its setting it seemed to open its portals to the indescribable feast of color, as a mighty prophet opens his heart to the inspiration of Divine Love. 21 See the discussion of Rossiter's work in Mark E. Thistlethwaite, "The Image of George Washington: Studies in Mid- Nineteenth Century American History Painting," (Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 1977), pp. 197-202. Thistlethwaite provides other contem- porary examples of paintings that used hidden images to depict the "shade" of Mount Vernon. Such illusions typi- cally suggested Washington's profile in the negative space between adjacent tree trunks. As components of what was considered popular art, these im- ages indicate the acceptance of such natural personification by Americans of the early nineteenth century. 22 See my "'Endued with Rare Genius': Frederic Edwin Church's To the Memory of Cole," Smithsonian Studies in American Art 2 (Winter 1988): 45- 71. 23 Durand's allegorical painting God's Judgement on Gog (ca. 1851, Chrysler Museum at Norfolk), which, like Kindred Spirits, was commissioned by Jonathan Sturges, strongly resembles the artist's memorial painting to Cole, most notably in its use of the emblem profile. 24 Literary World, 22 May 1847, p. 371. Henry Fuseli was a well-known Eng- lish romantic artist. 25 See Gerald L. Carr, Frederic Edwin Church, The Icebergs (Dallas: Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, 1980), p. 72. Carr also discusses related symbolism in the preparatory studies leading up to the large painting. Among these was a work with a snowman and an ice cross atop an ice bridge (no. 34, p.61). 26 On Cotopaxi's veiled symbolism see Katherine Manthorne, Creation and Renewal: Views of Cotopaxi by Frederic Edwin Church (Washington, D.C.: National Museum of American Art, 1985). "Mr. Church's Cotopaxi," The Albion (21 March 1863): 141. "Mr. Church's Pictures," Art Journal (De- cember 1865): 688. The formation, described by the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt as the Head of the Inca, was believed to have had its origins in an eruption contempora- neous with the conquest of the Incan empire by the Spanish. Manthorne, Creation and Renewal, p. 34. 27 Bierstadt's letters from the Rocky Mountains that were published in The Crayon of September 1859, p. 287, cannot have failed to gain Church's notice, and his success the following year with paintings of the Far West must have clearly suggested a rival to be watched. Additionally, Bierstadt's The Rocky Mountains (1863, Metropol- itan Museum of Art) and Church's Co- topaxi were virtually painted at the same time at the Tenth Street Studio Building, and it would have been very difficult for Church not to have known Bierstadt's new work. Church also wrote of this rivalry in letters to his friend and protege Martin J. Heade. In a letter of 26 May 1870, Church hu- morously remarked to Heade, "So Bierstadt won't speak to you-hey- why don't you draw him out. Ask him if he don't want to buy some butter- flies." This comment relates to Bierstadt's depiction of butterflies, which he often presented to guests in his studio as souvenirs. Church's self-portrait can be best understood in terms of the emerging rivalry between Church and Bierstadt. 63 Smithsonian Studies in American Art</page><page sequence="23">Church and Bierstadt were seen as rivals by 1864, when Church's Heart of the Andes was placed opposite Bierstadt's The Rocky Mountains at the New York Sanitary Art Fair. One reviewer around 1863 had this comment: I have said that Church's laurels were in danger; that one, at least, of his brotherhood had set foot upon his do- main, and was steadily advancing to his standard. I still think that Bierstadt is close upon Church, in breadth of range, aeriel perspective, and grand scenic proportions; but the light effects of the Cotopaxi leave the latter still be- yond all American artists, high and safe in a niche of his own.

There, since this war, and the wide and deep national agitation, strange analogies, different combinations, a different sunlight, or absence of it; ... After every great battle, a great storm.

On Saturday last, a forenoon like whirling demons, dark, with slanting rain, full of rage; and then the afternoon, so calm, so bathed with flooding splendor from heaven's most excellent sun, with at- mosphere of sweetness; so clear, it show'd the stars, long, long before the, were due. As the President came out on the capitol portico, a curious little white cloud, the only one in that part of the sky, appear'd like a hovering bird, right over him. Walt Whitman, Specimen Days in America (1882; reprint, London: Folio Society, 1979), pp. 90-91. 35 It is important to note that Church's Twilight, a Sketch, the study that di- rectly precedes Twilight in the Wilder- ness, also contains a "face of the Creator." It appears at the upper right center and resembles a crude smiling face cut through the clouds. When the work was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1859, a critic for the New York Times found fault with the lower clouds, which, in his opinion, looked more like a "mass of vapors whirled about into a kind of eccentric chaos upon the background of the blank space than of a floating atmospheric panorama."
