      <p>“The question now is not ‘Do animals think?’ It’s ‘How and what do they think?’” With this statement, Virginia Morell sets the theme of her book and the path of inquiry explored by the scientists she interviewed. To answer the latter question, researchers study ants, fish, birds, rats, elephants, dolphins, chimpanzees, dogs, and wolves. Each chapter introduces us to an animal group and associated cognitive studies. We also meet the scientists and learn about the challenges and controversies with which they grapple. It takes creativity, passion, and dedication to the years of observation required to design and implement compelling scientific studies about cognition. We have to be satisfied with the journey of discovery in this field because there are only tentative emerging answers to the <italic>how</italic> and maybe the <italic>what</italic> of animal thought. Two other interesting themes in this book are how changes and biases in the process of scientific inquiry are kept in check and the constant reminder that humans are animals and cognition does not distinguish us from other animals.</p>
      <p>Throughout the book the history of ethology and animal behavior research is woven into the varying lines of research employed to study cognition in animals with short or long life spans, living in aquatic or terrestrial environments, as small as ants or as large as elephants. Opinions about studying animal cognition have changed through the centuries. One shift since the 1950s, still controversial, is the use of anthropomorphic terms to provide a richer description of observations instead of being inaccurate projections of human characteristics. If nonhuman animals think, then the vocabulary had to change. Jane Goodall’s chimpanzee studies pioneered these alterations in language, resulting in key words now used in scientific papers such as <italic>animal play</italic>, <italic>animal consciousness</italic>, <italic>feeling pain</italic>, <italic>problem solving</italic>, <italic>self-recognition</italic>, <italic>empathy</italic>, and <italic>theory of mind</italic>. This history alone, and questions about anthropomorphizing, should lead to interesting class discussions of the process of science and how inquiry changes over time with the introduction of new technologies and techniques, more studies, and constant challenges and controversies.</p>
      <p>Phylogenetics is now in every textbook and is more broadly used at every level of biological research, so its inclusion is timely in this book. The emphasis is not only about what makes animals lineages distinct from each other. Morell reminds us that “No matter how different our morphology, we animals are basically alike because of our shared evolutionary past,” and that phylogenetics, as an underpinning of biological research, can be applied not only to shared DNA, morphology, and physiology but extends to behavior. According to one scientist she interviewed, “emotions and their associated feelings are ‘evolutionary skills’ that are constructed in the brains of all animals to help them face the challenges of life.” Brain anatomy reveals that at least elephants, whales, great apes, and humans share neurons, von Economo cells, associated with feelings of empathy, love, emotional suffering, and sociality.</p>
      <p>What is the evidence that suggests how and what animals think? The strength of the evidence – that rats play to help construct social behavior; that elephants feel sorrow for the death of their relatives; that fish make decisions; that dolphins form alliances to deal with social uncertainties – varies. The first chapter, “The Ant Teachers,” caught my attention because the research claims that the value of information, rather than the constraint of brain size, has influenced the evolution of teaching (see <uri xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7073/abs/439153a.html">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7073/abs/439153a.html</uri>). The evolutionary connection was not clearly made in this chapter. A more convincing study is presented in the chapter “Of Dogs and Wolves.” An experiment to tease out the evolution of cognition by examining cooperation between dogs and humans indicated that dogs may possess humanlike traits. Scientists know that wolves cooperate, “So the tendency to cooperate is there in the dogs’ ancestors. But to cooperate with an entirely different species, one not closely related on a genetic level – and to seek that cooperation above all else – means that something has fundamentally changed in the brains of dogs.” To find out about the current status of this research, see <uri xlink:href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/science/ enlisting-a-virtual-pack-to-study-dog-minds.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/science/ enlisting-a-virtual-pack-to-study-dog-minds.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0</uri>.</p>
      <p>The term “prove” is used frequently by science writers and is used continually throughout this book when referring to results of scientific investigation. In a book meant for a general audience, the use of “support” or “strongly support” instead of “prove” would better serve in introducing the readership to an accurate context of scientific process. Complete citations would also establish a scientific context. The sources of much of the original research described in the book are often mentioned in the text but only by journal, and sometimes by year. It would have been informative and useful to have all relevant research fully cited in either the Notes or Further Reading section.</p>

         <italic>Animal Wise</italic> would be an excellent expansion to the topic of animal behavior in college-level courses when used in conjunction with a general biology or zoology text’s animal behavior chapter and at least one of the following resources: <italic>Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior</italic> by S. J. Shettleworth; a selection of abstracts or papers from a recent conference on comparative cognition such as Animal Minds: From Computation to Evolution (<uri xlink:href="http://royalsociety.org/events/2012/animal-minds-computation/">http://royalsociety.org/events/2012/animal-minds-computation/</uri>); or the review of this conference, titled “‘Killjoys’ challenge claims of clever animals,” by M. Balter in <italic>Science</italic> (2012, vol. 335, pp. 1036–1037). Citations in the Notes and Further Reading sections of the book should also be considered. This combination would round out the foundational material with the current state of scientific inquiry in this very rich and changing field of animal behavior and cognition while fostering critical evaluation of the debate, synthesized by M. Balter in the abovementioned review, about how to test whether nonhuman animals’ abilities reflect humanlike cognition.</p>
