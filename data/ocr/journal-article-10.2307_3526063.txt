<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New. By Charles Rosen. pp. 328. (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., &amp; London, 2000, $29.95. ISBN 0-674-17730-4.) In every age critics have written about music in a particular way. Not everybody writes in the same way, but there are usually certain common ele- ments, methods, beliefs or ideologies that charac- terize the practices of critics, from the famous and the well read (not the same) to the all-but-forgot- ten. Every age has its Zeitgeist. Today we, too, write about music in a particular way, influenced by prevailing trends in a number of disciplines, and with certain agendas, themes and fashions in mind. Charles Rosen comes from a generation for whom writing about music differs from the way a younger generation write today, in emphasis, if not intent. He is one of those old, great critics who have a system but do not write systematically. His rigour is aesthetic rather than scientific. In fact, whether the system he 'has' is more consciously thought-out than simply picked up through experi- ence is unclear. It may be more appropriate to refer to his 'world-view'. At any rate, his writing style tends towards the memoir rather than the treatise, and his prose is concise, even pithy- you'll miss the point if your concentration lapses (rather like listening, then). What he says is directly practical, both in origin and intent, and is in some sense often too small for theory. For this Rosen is, like other critics of his generation, occasionally taken to task. Two particular beliefs running through Rosen's latest collection of essays, Critical Entertainments, warrant specific attention: the belief that musical understanding arises as much experientially- more specifically, performatively-as through the mediation of written texts; and, more important, the belief that a certain, quite particular tone of engagement is a prerequisite for musical under- standing. At first glance, the cover of this book may seem rather ostentatious for a volume of book reviews and music criticism. There is a photograph of Rosen sitting at a piano, turned to face the camera, with his right hand playing and the fingers of his left hand resting on his forehead. The image is like that of Rodin's The Thinker, though Rosen looks directly and almost unnervingly at the camera. Perhaps the photo would have been more understandable adorning the cover of a recording, where the image of the performer is central to the product being sold. That, however, is precisely the point. Rosen the performer and Rosen the writer are one and the same. Even the titles in Critical Entertainments are symbolic: 'Per- formance and Musicology' (Part I), rather than 'Musicology and Performance' (the title of Paul Lang's posthumous book, edited by Alfred Mann and George J. Buelow (New Haven &amp; London, 1997). Rosen's concern is with people and their music, and his practice is deeply anthropo- morphic: his music has a life of its own. Rosen's abiding concern with 'the realities of musical life' (p. 250), with 'the professional side of music . . . [and] the demands of the performers' (p. 2), comes out in his remark that taking the 'profession' of musicology (pp. 235, 255) beyond its conventional and historical isolation into literature, history and politics is not yet taking it into the real world (p. 256). By this he means, speaking per- sonally of course, the world of performance, with its non-musical pressures and 'economic problems' (p. 299), the world where money changes hands and people take risks. He relates, for example, how, 'Subsequent to the publication of the second article [which was amalgamated to form Chapter 18, 'The Irrelevance of Serious Music', and which strongly criticized a letter from Peter Gelb to the New rork Times], Peter Gelb cancelled a compact disc about the piano that I was super- vising for Sony, in collaboration with National Public Radio' (p. 294). Performance, then, for Rosen, stands as fons et origo. It creates and binds a musical culture. As he remarks about the nineteenth-century listener (whose aesthetics are not far removed from his own), 'Grove's Dictionary was meant primarily for the educated layman, for those who hoped to set their appreciation of concert music on a firmer foundation, to correct their taste by knowledge' (p. 234)-a phrase redolent of T. S. Eliot. Thus, for Rosen himself, writing about music means writing about musical performance, and it often arises as a 282</page><page sequence="2">pearl from an oyster-from an irritation. It seeks 'to correct the listener's taste by knowledge'. As he says, 'I began writing about music some years ago largely to keep someone else's nonsense off my record jackets' (p. 1); and, later, 'this introduction [Chapter 3] to the keyboard music of Bach and Handel was intimately bound up with a recording project' (p. 25); and later still (this one a familiar swipe of Rosen's), 'Mozart does not need to be decoded but listened to' (p. 100). Rosen is thor- oughly Francophile in this emphasis on the act of performance; his comments on, for example, the private, quasi-devotional playing (rather than 'per- formance') of Bach's keyboard music bear detailed comparison with Part II, 'Music's Body', of Roland Barthes's The Responsibility of Forms: Critical Essays on Music, Art, and Representation (trans. Richard Howard, Berkeley, 1985). Scattered throughout Critical Entertainments are remarks about the potential use of music criticism by the various members of a musical culture. One of the themes running through Chapter 15, 'The New Musicology', is that music criticism may no longer play the same role for performer, listener, composer and critic. As Rosen concludes, ambiva- lently (though I detect a quiet tone of regret), 'Both these [New Grove] articles [Harold Powers on 'Mode' and Carl Dahlhaus on 'Counterpoint'] require from the reader a considerable background in musicological literature, and in music as well. The layman will find them impenetrable, the amateur and professional musician difficult. I doubt that many doctoral candidates in music- ology will get through them with ease. The average student has almost disappeared as a possible audience here: Powers and Dahlhaus are writing for colleagues. No doubt we must say (along with the admirers of Symbolist poetry): so much the worse for the common reader if one can produce writing of such excellence' (p. 236). Writing, then, can be a form of spin, a strategy of control. Rosen wants his readers to believe what he believes about music, and to the same or at least a similar degree; which is equally to say, he wants his readers, too, to admire it and feel its unique- ness. It is in this sense that his way of writing about music is a performance of sorts, for it is motivated by love (about which more below). It is more important to love music than the idea of it, and as far as the performer is concerned, it may be that he or she does not need the sort of 'music appreciation' text from which the listener sometimes benefits, or at least not in the same way; if such a text is useful to the performer, it is useful only so long as he or she is rehearsing, and is not on-stage. John Rink has some pertinent remarks to make on this subject, taking a similar stand to Rosen: 'Even though an interpretation will vary with the occasion, performers must commit them- selves to a particular inferred "meaning" in a given performance if the playing is to have any sense of direction. Weighing up options on the concert platform is simply not viable' ('Translating Mu- sical Meaning: the Nineteenth-Century Performer as Narrator', in Rethinking Music, ed. Nicholas Cook &amp; Mark Everist, Oxford, 1999, p. 217 n. 2). The tone of the performer's engagement with the written word, then, may well be quite simple. Unlike the critic writing about performers and performance (not the same thing), the performer ought to be pragmatic about the types and amounts of 'knowledge' required (however this is defined)-and simply discard the rest. Ultimately, the sheer mass of information he or she needs to consider may be somewhat smaller than what the critic generally deals with. Nevertheless, although what the performer eventually discards may be taken 'on trust' (p. 236), when assimilating those texts or parts of texts that he or she thinks may be directly 'useful' (however this is defined) there is, as Rosen argues, an even greater need for 'a little scepticism', 'not too much self-confidence', 'a little uncertainty' and 'a large dose of suspicion' (all pp. 248-9). Turning to Rosen the writer, underpinning his approach lies a basic faith in the possibility of a relation between language and experience. There is a Husserlian dimension to his writing here, which, though it may seem methodologically naive today, has a number of interesting aspects. For example, for Rosen the primary function of writing about music is to seek a deeper under- standing of the gestures of musical performance and of the works that are performed (using 'ges- ture' as Richard Blackmur understood the term in the eponymous essay in his Language as Gesture: Essays in Poetry (London, 1954, pp. 3-24)). Writing attempts to balance the claims of 'language as gesture' with those of 'gesture as language', the assumption being that, if music is at least partly a language (in being some form of humanly sym- bolic activity), then language ought-note the verb-to try and meet it half-way. Seeking a precariously singular, unique relation with the music, the extent of 'The Authority of Music Criticism' (to filch a title of Edward Cone's) arises in the degree to which it succeeds in doing so. Thus Rosen has a tendency to describe music in superlatives: 'the most famous phrase that Mozart ever wrote' (p. 223) with reference to the late G minor Symphony, and so on. These, true as far as they go, if reinforcing a particular view of the 283</page><page sequence="3">musical canon, help to describe and characterize the musical experience more vividly, even while running the risk of essentialism (no doubt Rosen can write like this without worrying, because he is a performer, not a musicologist). Such is the basis for the regular claims made on the dust-jacket of Rosen's books that he is able to express in a few well-chosen words what today's generation take several pages to describe. This is how Rosen articulates his central points; they are characterized by a certain singularity, almost extremity, of position. What about the more numerous secondary comments, which digress from or intensify the primary points in order to make them felt ? Many of these comments are little more than anecdotes: off-the-cuff remarks illustrating a point in passing, as figures in the nominal background of a painting bear on those in the foreground. Moriz Rosenthal (Rosen's teacher) is always mentioned in this capacity (pp. 7, 178 n. 4, 218, 244), as are other members of the pantheon of great pianists, such as Artur Schnabel (pp. 164, 307, 315), Josef Hofmann (pp. 244, 296) and Solomon (p. 216). The interesting thing about these anecdotes, such as when Rosen relays the joke Alfred Einstein and friends played on Reger (p. 253), or when he describes, in a Montaignesque episode, the stitches he had needed after bumping his head on a BBC microphone during a rehearsal of his friend Elliott Carter's Double Concerto (p. 291), is that they embody a primarily perform- ative conception of musical understanding. They pass on a whole lifetime of experience almost directly to the reader, quietly and often without comment. 'So casual yet so woven, digressive yet powerfully recursive' (Geoffrey Hartman, 'Lionel Trilling as Man in the Middle', in idem, The Fate of Reading and Other Essays, Chicago, 1975, p. 297), their value lies, not so much in what they purport to say but, rather, in what happens when you place them into your own musical practice-when you yourself act upon them, in whatever manner. In this fundamental sense, Rosen's essays are meant to be read aloud, or, better still, heard in the lecture hall. Published, they are transcriptions. This performative element is essential to Rosen's practice, and opens up text into act, thought into experience-for him, at any rate. As Nicholas Cook might repeat, reading is not enough: these lectures are meant to be 'done'. Rosen's performance-based conception of mu- sical understanding underlies the almost offhand remark he makes at the end of his interpretation of Brahms's C major Intermezzo Op. 119 No. 3: 'Interpretation of this passage also depends on an understanding of the traditional Viennese waltz' (p. 161). So much depends on that little word "also"! Rosen's remark must be understood in context, coming as it does after a quite detailed and lengthy analytical commentary on the subver- sive style of the movement. What lies behind the remark is the idea that performance ought-that verb, again-to be grounded in the contingency of stylistic awareness, and ought not to remain a matter of playing the notes merely as his, or any other, analysis has described them. And stylistic awareness, like moral character, takes time to develop (witness the epigram heading Rose Rosen- gard Subotnik's Developing Variations: Style and Ideology in Western Music (Minneapolis, 1991): 'Character isn't taught, it's caught'). Like his all- too-brief remarks about the relation between vocal and pianistic voices in Brahms's piano music (pp. 177-8), the way in which Rosen shrugs off this little remark betrays its proper size. The intermezzo is a Viennese waltz historically or generically, and is not a Viennese waltz aesthetic- ally; the two together create the stylistic singularity of the work in performance. (The understanding of musical style, both historical and aesthetic, that has been a lifelong concern of Rosen's writing, and that comes from a deep immersion in music, has had directly practical benefits for Rosen elsewhere: his recording of Stravinsky's Movements with the composer is the only recording in which you can clearly hear phrases as well as notes-almost antecedents and consequents, too-particularly in the final one.) Characteristic of Rosen's performative concep- tion of musical understanding is its criterion for soundness of judgement. What is musically 'wrong' is what is not historically conditioned- which does not mean determined-by stylistic conventions, traditions and performance practices. Rosen sometimes describes the remarks, decisions or interpretations of other musicians as 'absurd' (pp. 209 n. 1, 258), 'ludicrous' (p. 223), 'foolish' (p. 241), 'loony' (p. 309) or 'nonsense' (p. 1). This is less evidence of a short-tempered writer than a reflection of his personal view of the role of know- ledge in the musical act: necessary but silent (compare the familiar familial dictum 'children should be seen but not heard'). For Rosen, know- ledge should be put towards the kinds of musical judgement that are aimed for during performance, and the kinds of judgement that he finds absurd are those that bear no relation to the hard realities of performance-hence his contrast of 'common- sense' with 'idealism' (p. 210). In this, Rosen takes after Brahms: "Any jackass can see that" (pp. 134, 163). There are three potential dangers of thinking 284</page><page sequence="4">about musical understanding solely in terms of what happens during performance (to the exclu- sion of 'what' is performed). To some degree, I think, Rosen falls into the second and third traps- though it is unclear whether or not, within his own terms of reference, this is a problem. The first is the tendency for the cultural contexts in which performance takes place to be sidelined in favour of an idealistic notion of 'the act itself' sans grounding-its internal moments alone. The second is the assumption that performative under- standing is, since it comes physically and aurally, and hence directly-or so it is assumed-from performance, 'authentic', and thus necessarily of value. The third danger, related to the second, is the very assumption at the heart of Rosen's con- ception of musical understanding: that there is a community of variously like-minded, 'cultivated' (p. 132) people of whom Rosen himself is one, and in which each (Rosen included) plays a particular and delimited role. Motivated by love for the music, Rosen's community arises as a result of what, in a completely different context, has been termed 'cultural effort' (Ludmilla Jordanova, 'Cul- tural Effort: an Introductory Essay', in idem, Nature Displayed: Gender, Science, and Medicine 1760-1820, London, 1999, Chap. 1). Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that some critics of Rosen's generation have been criticized for assum- ing such effort to be widespread among their readers, and for indiscriminate use of the pronoun 'we' to invoke their imagined community. Such an assumption (correct or otherwise) of a certain community between the critic and his or her readers, or what today we call a musical 'culture', does characterize Rosen's musical practice, the community that he invokes being the world of 'concert-goers' (p. 50) and the works and 'artefacts' (p. 206, quoting Nicholas Kenyon) they listen to, which are those in which the work-concept plays, or in the case of early music is made to play, a meaningful role (pp. 10-11). It remains to be seen, though, whether Rosen's related emphases on live performance, on the culture which it sustains (and which sustains it), and on the particular type of understanding that arises in such events, will survive, or whether his liberalism will increasingly be seen-if it isn't already-as an ideology appro- priate only to a specific historical community. One of the consequences of Rosen's perform- ance-centred conception of musical understanding is that there is a certain degree of repetitiveness and redundancy in his writing. Thematically, it tends more towards the variation than the sonata principle. Consider, for example, his remarks on improvisation in Handel's keyboard suites (p. 243 n. 3, repeating pp. 49-50), on the performance of the Art of Fugue and Well-Tempered Clavier (pp. 301, 215-16, 46-7, repeating p. 32), on the three stage orchestras in Don Giovanni (pp. 113, 91, repeating pp. 81-2), or on the boredom of sitting through a whole concert of Albinoni's music (p. 315, repeat- ing p. 56). Of course, this is partly because the individual essays in Critical Entertainments were written separately over a period of a quarter of a century; it is not strictly repetitiveness. What it does reflect, however, is a certain kind of obsession with a number of favourite themes and subjects, and this is less a symptom of a narrow mind than a sign of a proper engagement, or involvement, with music. Of what does this consist? Consider Rosen's introduction. This is a mini-manifesto, a confes- sion about what drives him as a musician. For Rosen, writing seeks to intensify the actual experi- ence of music-its pleasure-at the same time as this is presupposed in the very act of musical engagement. Similarly, 'the intense concentration on the text of a work of music is a joy, sensuous as well as intellectual' (p. 270). In fact, 'pleasure' is both a prerequisite for understanding music (p. 3) and its goal, its 'profit' (p. 29). Writing about music should seek to connect 'historical meaning and pleasure' (p. 271) and should have 'a sense of excitement', 'recklessness' (both p. 256), 'exhilara- tion' (p. 257) and 'a racy, vigorous, and consist- ently entertaining style' (p. 263). What Rosen calls 'pleasure', and elsewhere 'the delights of imagination' (p. 206) and the 'ecstasy' of the occasion (pp. 104, quoting Marianne Moore, and 318), would be, for someone like Bernstein, 'fun', and for a Barthes, 'pleasure' or 'bliss'. Historically, we might turn to Lionel Trilling's sombre essay 'The Fate of Pleasure' (in idem, Beyond Culture: Essays on Literature and Learning, London, 1965, pp. 50-76), in which the historical vicissitudes of the titular notion, and specifically its changing association with notions of beauty and the sublime, chart the history of the relations between man's artistic and moral lives. Trilling's essay provides an interesting background to Rosen's discussion of the high-temperature reac- tions that characterize modern music and its labour of self-definition (Part V, subtitled 'The Crisis of the Modern'). One of the characteristics of musical engage- ment and its 'sense of excitement' is the peculiarly individual nature of the dynamic between the performer and the music. There is a certain reciprocity in the act, an element of 'being-per- formed' in performing, an element of giving-of giving attention. For the performer, as indeed for 285</page><page sequence="5">the writer and his or her subject, this attention is of a specific sort: an intense, focused, almost obses- sive attention to the needs and demands of the present moment. This requires great concentra- tion, great stamina, even physical training; and it can be risky, which makes it frightening and a source of some anxiety, even pathology (Murray Dineen, 'Musical Performance, Ethics, and Mu- sical Scholarship', paper given at a conference at the University of Southampton, 26 April 2000). Rosen's essay 'The Aesthetics of Stage Fright' (Chap. 1) points out that these terms of musical engagement are similar to those of being in love. There are social, cultural, aesthetic, even physio- logical similarities between the two (p. 7). Indeed, it is no coincidence that stage fright can be translated into the language of psychoanalysis, such as that of Erich Fromm's classic text The Art of Loving (London, 1957). Holding, significantly, that love is in fact an art, an on-going activity rather than a condition or state of being, Fromm's four elements of love, namely, discipline, concen- tration, patience and an all-encompassing concern with its importance (The Art of Loving, pp. 84-6), ring true with what Rosen says about the performer's relation with the music and his or her need to confront the stage-fright demon. With- out the contingency of performance, there could be no stage fright; or rather, it is because the indivi- duality or musical personality of the performer is a function of his or her contingency that he or she suffers from stage fright. That stage fright hardly ever disappears without 'regret' (p. 10) suggests that, if nothing else, the musical act involves work, hard though pleasurable. It is a Sisyphean labour. Like his essay on the performance of Bach's keyboard music (Chap. 3), like the physical and aesthetic 'awkwardness' in Brahms (Chap. 11), like his critique of authenticity and the early music 'crusade' (p. 201), Rosen's point about stage fright turns on his distinction between public and private forms of music making-on the complicity of the listener in the musical event. This is to say that presupposed in the musical act there is a certain intimacy between the performer and 'the music' (however the latter is conceived), and that this can be respected or violated by the third-party listener. Indeed, the historical shift of emphasis from pri- vate to public performance runs parallel both to the emergence of the work-concept and to chan- ging conceptions of ethics and of virtue (read: virtuosity), and hence of the role of music in human and social life-'the reason that music exists' (p. 296). For Rosen, pleasure does not come into being simply as a kind of secretion; for the musical act to be pleasurable, it requires a certain motivation. In one place, he uses 'amateur' (p. 314) in a revealing sense, glossed long ago by Richard Blackmur: 'Criticism, I take it, is the formal discourse of an amateur. When there is enough love and enough knowledge represented in the discourse it is a self- sufficient but by no means of an isolated art' ('A Critic's Job of Work', in idem, The Double Agent: Essays in Craft and Elucidation, New York, 1935, p. 269; repr. in idem, Language as Gesture, p. 372). Elsewhere Rosen talks explicitly about the 'love' of modem music (p. 305). This is important. What Rosen is saying is that the proper way to 'attend' music (p. 3) is motivated not only by the pleasure to be gained but by what motivates pleasure itself: love. Therein lies the meaning of music (which is why, for Rosen at least, it doesn't need to be decoded; p. 100). What does Rosen mean by this? There are a number of potential genealogies for his conception of the pleasure of musical engagement and the love of performance. Blackmur's is but one. Most, though, are based on the literary model of reading a text (including Barthes's seminal The Pleasure of the Text, trans. Richard Miller, Oxford, 1975). It seems to be more appropriate to consider Rosen's musical practice in the company of thinkers who deal with temporality and its human significance in a way more suited to the needs and contingen- cies of real-time musical performance. One is Emmanuel Levinas, whose intellectual project was, significantly, to show how time is the very accomplishment of the relation with the other, and for whom 'The "unique one" means the loved one, love being the condition of the very possibility of uniqueness' (Time and the Other, trans. Richard Cohen, Pittsburgh, 1987, p. 108). Another is Mikhail Bakhtin, for whom 'It is only love (as an active approach to another human being) that unites an inner life (a subiectum's own object-direct- edness in living his life) as experienced from out- side with the value of the [subiectum's] body as experienced from outside and, in so doing, con- stitutes a unitary and unique human being as an aesthetic phenomenon' ('Author and Hero in Aes- thetic Activity', in idem, Art and Answerability: Early Philosophical Essays, ed. Michael Holquist &amp; Vadim Liapunov, trans. Vadim Liapunov, Austin, 1993, pp. 82-3). For the truth of musical performance is a func- tion of the pleasure that comes from the act of performance. And this pleasure is itself a function of what Bakhtin called 'active love', which, though it does not depend on reason, nevertheless has a certain reason, a rationale, of its own. Pace Levinas, it is, as the ground of a performing relation with 286</page><page sequence="6">music, beyond-more correctly, before-know- ledge, before the Cartesian subject-object dual- ism. Pace Bakhtin, it is integrally related to Rosen's anthropomorphic stance: it is precisely because Rosen makes a metaphorical (but necessary) anthropomorphic leap that he is able to love music-the one presupposes the other. To see the human in music is to love it. Active love, then, is another way of talking about human responsibility, and this, I believe, is precisely how Rosen con- ceives of the proper way to engage with music, both historically and aesthetically-with style. It remains to be said only that, like the virtues it extols, this is a 'passionate' (p. 318) book. It is about loving music. In fact, these are the two most important things that can be said about it. Little can be said about the practice of music, and Critical Entertainments is a practical book through and through, right down to its title. Nevertheless, although these essays have already appeared in print elsewhere (with the exception of Chapter 11), they certainly deserve to be read again. Critical Entertainments is that rare combination, of both the critical and the entertaining-as one would expect from a performer. ANTHONY GRITTEN Absolute Music and the Construction of Meaning. By Daniel K. L. Chua. pp. xii + 314. 'New Per- spectives in Music History and Criticism'. (Cambridge University Press, 1999, ?40. ISBN 0-521-63181-5.) Daniel Chua's second book, Absolute Music and the Construction of Meaning, may at its most funda- mental level be intended simply to spell out, in ways hitherto lacking or unexplored, the relation- ship between 'absolute music' and 'meaning' (or 'construction of meaning', if that is different). Owing to the wide spread of arguments in the book, there are many clues throughout to Chua's general project, many possible starting-points for an explanation of what he is about. The structure of the book itself reflects how Chua thinks the phenomenon of absolute music may be observed, as a black hole with stars clustered about it. The stars, the 35 chapters, are fragments of the identity of absolute music, and it seems no accident that the source Chua makes most use of is Friedrich Schlegel, whose fragmentary aphorisms he liber- ally quotes. The chapters are grouped in three parts. Parts I and II are called 'The Garden of Eden' and 'The Fruit of Knowledge' respectively, to evoke the idea of the ahistorical absolute first at its artificial origin and then at its awakening in the nineteenth century. Part III is called 'The Tower of Babel' because it describes modernity's self- induced drive to propel itself forward, separating from its origins. This tripartite structure may suggest a historical framework, but the book is not a historical essay, and the structure seems more of a historical accommodation of Chua's rich, complex thought than a chronological pre- scription. Ultimately, the onus on the reader is to discern what is offered by the fragmentation of thought which is presented. One way of setting out the book's agenda occurs at the end of Chapter 3, 'On Disenchantment': 'Absolute music is therefore only absolute in that it recalls the past when music was once absolute reality. Today absolute music simply curls up in its own orbit as a microcosm of some unknown universe, discovering an aesthetic freedom in an autonomy that is out of tune with the cosmos' (p. 22). Chua here and in many other parts of the book seems to dissociate himself from traditional claims that instrumental music is, absolutely, music par excellence. Instead, and as a musicologist primarily drawing on work from other disciplines (whose discourses musicology has only lately been catching up with), he wishes to explain that absolute music is as ontologically rooted in extra- musical realities as it is in the progression of aesthetic positions from mimesis to autonomy, and very likely even more so. There is indeed an overall sense that the book is felt (by Chua himself and by the publisher) to be a pioneering attempt in this direction-that it is one of the most radical current musicological efforts to quantify what has in recent decades been the concern of literary theory, poetics and the rest of a substantial list of other fields all vying to answer the demands of a postmoder world. The book features in the CUP series 'New Perspectives in Music History and Criticism'. This series-now, with Chua's, includ- ing five titles in areas from French Enlightenment theory to rap music-aims 'to create a greater presence of music in the ongoing discourse among the human sciences'. Chua's book certainly and creditably addresses this aim. It not only follows on from but also extends the work of Lawrence Kramer and a host of other writers. Generally, the likely intended readership is a mixture of historical musicologists, historians of aesthetics and cultural theorists (which could in- clude documenters of visual culture), the current standards of whose work may be challenged and even upset by Chua's work. To get a further sense of Chua's project, refer- ences to which are framed and reframed through- out the book, it is perhaps well to look at what 287</page></plain_text>
