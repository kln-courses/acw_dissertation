<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NON-DUALISTIC VIEW OF NATURAL SELECTION. With old-line evolutional ethics' the struggle for existence and natural selection made their way as recognized aids to the furtherment of accepted morality, and thus, by preserving the proper relations between altruism and egoism, wayward man and his conscience, entered ethical theory under the protective coloring of ideas under control of a theology in process of extinc- tion. The evolutional moralists, rid of theological encumbrances, were seeking to accomplish on a somewhat higher plane, and in a rarer atmosphere, what the reconcilers had striven for-the equa- tion of new results with old truth. Identities were more evident than differences. The organism and its perfect structure seemed a more real and interesting thing than the individual, so perfectly fitted to the stupendous whole. But it soon became evident that natural selection and the struggle for existence had been difficult incidents to manage, and that the outcome for man and his morality might have been far otherwise than had been suspected. In biology the growing tendency to restrict the recognized field of operation of natural selection only emphasized the contrasts between this so-called automatic principle and those intelligent or conscious modes of action by which evolution seemed guided in the sphere of human affairs. If these were rejected by the faithful evolutionist, a literal rendering of biological evolution into ethical terms showed nothing more valuable than mere life or existence as the outcome of human evolution, and thus emphasized only those individual or racial qualities which promote mere survival. As a result, we were left to a choice between the idealists' dualistic view of nature and 'selection,' and an equally dualistic but purely ma- terialistic, individualistic, and egoistic ethic. Our question now concerns the nature of this dualistic conception of the foregoing concepts and the reason for its perpetuation. 'By which may be understood theories like those of Spencer and Alexander, which accept evolution not as a mere account of a process, but, by reference to natural selection, as a guide also. 418</page><page sequence="2">NAT URAL SELECTION 4I9 I. We may begin with the frequently noted fact that natural selection-formulated by Darwin as "the preservation of favor- able individual differences and variations and the destruction of those that are injurious"-was a conception borrowed from the sphere of human purposeful activity and transferred to the bio- logical realm, in which it has acquired more or less precise con- notation. It was a metaphor in the beginning, and now, if it be applied to human conduct, it must lose something of the significance acquired in the biological field. Natural selection must, for example, apply to habits as well as to structural varia- tions. Wie are not concerned, however, with the legitimacy of its application from the biological but rather from the ethical viewpoint, and particularly with the misconceptions which here beset it. Now in the very precision with which physical science fixes its concepts is involved a danger, especially when a concept, fixed only within a limited field, is attended by a cloud of other ideas- in this case, 'nature,' 'struggle,' 'environment,' 'life,' etc., which can hardly be used without lurking metaphysical reference. The very term 'natural,' rather than 'biological selection,'" proper sixty years ago, has lost its applicability, yet still persists only to revive and perpetuate penumbral metaphysical associations with the 'nature' of common-sense dualism. We minimize, says Professor Ritter,2 the grip in which miraculous creation held men's minds. At a time when special or supernatural creation was held as a dogma, 'natural' was the antonym required to make plain the fact that species were not produced by super- natural design. Now, with the latter view long discarded, 'nat- ural' is left to bear the connotation which it had only through reference to a special theological conception. That natural selection is a term not literally descriptive of fact has been pointed out again and again. Natural selection, we are told, does not really select, but in the next breath it is said that it is a 'principle of extermination.' Although this is more clearly descriptive of the negative influence of the multitude 'E. g., in Karl Pearson's Grammar of Science. 2"Darwin's Place in Natural Selection," Pop. Sci. Mo., Jan., I9IO.</page><page sequence="3">420 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. of causes summarized by the term, is it less misleading? While we recognize that natural selection is a mere "shorthand expres- sion for a whole group of well-known natural causes"' or "a great bundle of causes, some of which are different in each par- ticular case to which the bundle applies,"2 we yet speak of natural selection as of an entity, call it 'merciless,' or say that it "works blindly upon promiscuous variations blindly pro- duced."3 As a matter of fact, it operates no more and no less 'blindly' than the group of causes summarized by the name, which tend to the elimination of those characters that do not favor the adaptation of the individual organism to its environ- ment, and thus to the destruction of the individual possessors. It would seem that all such expressions, which simply beg the question of specific causes, are scarcely less anthropomorphic than nature personifications current in another day-to the effect that 'nature is exceedingly wise and all her works are performed with understanding,' that she "does nothing in vain," "never fails of her purpose," or "always does what is best."4 From this point of view the struggle for existence fares no better, and the matter needs little elucidation. Nature has been portrayed as "a vast slaughter-house," a theater of war, in which there occurs perpetually a struggle of all against all. How ex- ceedingly false and calumnious !-as Carlyle said of the axiom that "nature abhors a vacuum." The facts cannot be denied, but the difficulty over the applicability of terms remains more than a mere quibble. Nature is personified as a devil. And though one may discard an anthropomorphic super-mundane god for an infra-mundane or immanent devil, we ought not to overlook the genetic relationship. The actual struggle of individual with individual, species with species, plays relatively a small part in the universal effort to obtain food, soil, habitation, or, in general, access to the condi- tions of existence. The universal struggle is only an effort to 'Romanes, Darwin and After Darwin, Vol, I, Ch.

If there is overcrowding, this is no affair of nature's. Ruling out all teleology, she has no predestined goal. She has no instinct for the type, nor does she bear special malice toward the individual. Adaptation, conformity to environment, are all that are required, and if in the process competition arise, and natural selection be brought into operation, this broad fact of conformity to environment is the general condition which brings into play the special selective principle. The plant or animal species is forced to be content with unfavorable soil or altitude through the pressure of hardier or better adapted rivals; its evolution is thereby conditioned and in time it may perish. Natural selection presupposes, indeed, the struggle for exist- ence, but the rival species are simply factors in the environment, conditioning through special groups of causes, which their pres- ence introduces, the preservation or elimination of these varia- tions. The 'prodigality of nature,' the overcrowding and the universality of competition, ought not to obscure the fact that the selective forces by which certain variations are eliminated is a natural selection and goes on in a way to which struggle, or com- petition, is incidental. If we look to the process of elimination by which nature 'selects' certain variations to the exclusion of others, natural selection is a general term for a multitude of causes operative in the environment. If we note the general fact of crowding, as a special condition under which the process of elimination occurs, it becomes a name for a more restricted and determinable group of causes due to the presence of rivals. When sexual selection, isolation, and other factors concerned in evolution are made subordinate to natural selection, the former use of the term seems to predominate. When the scope of natural selection is restricted with reference to other principles, it is used chiefly in the latter sense. The apparent applicability of natural selection to morals has so frequently been pointed out that in a paper which treats rather of misconceptions than of opposing theories as a whole only the briefest mention seems necessary. Obviously analogies exist in plenty. The prodigality of nature is ably seconded by man in the profusion of human ideas, theories,</page><page sequence="5">422 THE PRILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL.

The competition in this sphere is no less keen,' and though aberrant social, ethical or political ideas may long survive by reason of their correlation with other ideas or prin- ciples, elimination is in the end effected by a process which paral- lels that which occurs in the biological realm. Three hundred years ago it was not the exception but the rule for a genuine scientific conception to make its way into the world under the protective coloring of theological ideas. On the other hand, ideas regarding the antipodes, the form of the earth, the nature and cause of motion, etc., based upon Scripture or the authority of Aristotle, long served as 'warning colors' which for centuries told of the power and venom which lay in ecclesiastical system, and bade the over-curious adventurer in the realm of nature keep his distance from 'truths' held sacred. We see too how phenomena which occur in the animal world are paralleled at the human stage of evolution in the migration of fashions, customs, ideas, philosophies-witness the displace- ment of an endemic by an exotic species in the migration of German idealism to England in the last century. And again the old problem, How an organ, not yet functionally active and thus without utility, can be preserved, obtains its solution in the sphere of human ideas in the protection which a proven theory or name offers. Its continuance is rendered possible by its cor- relation with useful ideas or its utility for subsidiary ends. Even seemingly useless organs in the growing body of thought are here preserved. Who but for the powerful influence of a Lodge, a James, or a Lombroso would still treat spiritualism as a living issue? The business, social, and political worlds furnish abundant instances of the general tendency to the checking of variations unserviceable to the continuance of group-ideas within each sphere. The cheaply made article must be protected by an inducement to the public in the form of a prize package, and if the expensive article is to make its way, a demand-a new en- vironment-must somehow be created.

Ethics, Vol. 2.</page><page sequence="6">No. 4.] NATURAL SELECTION. 423 modify the scope or rigor of his proposed project, the politician his measure, if he would survive in the capacity of social reformer or politician. These commonplaces of attention in the field of analogy are not suggested as marking evidence that a process of natural selection occurs in the sphere of human conduct. It is the negative rather than the positive aspect of the problem that con- cerns us. If we grant with the evolutional moralist that anal- ogy may warrant the application of this concept to morality, then we may ask: (A) What are the leading objections to such an application, and (B), Why does a thoroughgoing evolutional ethics, seeking guidance from this principle, present ends which are manifestly at cross-purposes with the ideals that emerge from an idealistic conception of nature and of man? It would seem that, but for a latent dualism, evolution and a genuine idealism should yield approximately the same standards. Both are in intent and tendency monistic, though these standards are ap- proached from opposite points of view. II. As regards the first question, then, (A) we have first to note (i) the general objection that natural selection is a soulless mechanical process, careless of individual welfare and mindful only of the type. In the evolutional process there is no room for the individual qua individual. Personality can have no abid- ing significance. Nature seeks the preservation of the race, the mere survival of the human species; the individual counts for nothing. Now whatever the cosmic process may have in store for the individual and species, the foregoing objection does not seem to hold good in the sphere of human evolution. The common as- sertion that in the organic world natural selection is directed toward the species, and not toward the individual, admits of a real objection. For "if the character in question is to be preserved by survival, it must be of vital importance to the individual, or it has no influence on the race. "' This seems to hold true of man's conduct also. However true it may be that qualities of the individual-obedience, self-restraint, etc.-which make for 'Conn, The Method of Evolution, p. 88.</page><page sequence="7">424 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEU'. [VOL. XIX. the welfare of society, are not those which would favor his con- tinuance as an abstract unit apart from the group, the qualities or habits must first be acquired or learned, and made organic to the individual's own ends in the situation in which he is placed before they can be of service to society. Natural selection is, it is true, an 'automatic' process, but this only means that by the elimination of those variations which are unserviceable to the type, or species, natural selection so operates as to group individuals about a mean. And it is just the preser- vation of this mean that among human beings constitutes the essential condition of moral progress and individual development. We have only to look to recent idealistic theories in confir- mation of this. The individual does not come into the world a full-fledged personality. His personality is admittedly an achievement, a social product. He "feeds upon social models," and by imitation and counter-imitation, trial and repetition, grows into a knowledge of himself. As he goes out into the world the social models, by reference to which his growing body of judgments is socially constituted, are enlarged and become more complex, approaching more nearly the group-concept of his class, community or people. And however much indi- viduality he may display, his life as an individual is lived in constant reference to this mean of thought and belief which has established itself and in the past found outward expression in recognized customs, beliefs, and institutions. The establishment of such a mean is the condition of the life and growth of the individual, though in its growth deviation from the norm may be as rigorously excluded here as are unfavorable variations in the infra-human world. And if the objection be raised that a mean which represents a community of judgments or belief, a social standard to which the individual must approximate, is something very different from a mathematical mean, the reply is, that natural selection signifies merely that groups of 'natural' (as op- posed to supernatural) causes cooperate in the production of an effect; it is not a theory of the nature of these 'natural' causes or of the mean established by their operation. And it seems unnecessary that, granting the process, it should</page><page sequence="8">No. 4.] NATURAL SELECTION. 425 be called 'mechanical'-as opposed to purposeful or intelligent. From the same point of view the process of selective attention, involved deeply in every logical association of ideas, is 'mechani- cal,' since from the swarm of competing ideas only those are selected that, by reason of their momentarily useful connection with other ideas, are pertinent to the controlling interest or guiding complex of ideas' which controls the forming judgment. If we look to the mere swarm of ideas and neglect the organic relationship between the guiding complex and the elements, which, with reference to the latter, find place in the logical asso- ciation, the selection seems 'mechanical,' or determined by the strongest idea or impulse, most recent association, etc. If we single out the fact that the elements obtain their individuality and significance only by reference to the complex, the latter becomes purposive and the selection 'teleological.' One process is the obverse of the other; or, we take a structural view in the one case, in the other a dynamical view of the same function. Similarly with reference to natural selection, whether in the sphere of human conduct or of animal activity. If we look to the aggregate of individuals, natural selection seems mechanically to determine the survival only of those which possess certain characters of utility to the species, the individual as individual counting for nothing. Survival is then to the strongest, but strength will usually lie in the possession of those characters which are of service to the species. If, however, we reflect that the species is not, after all, an entity, but a group of individuals possessing certain relatively fixed structural and functional char- acters, which in competition secure their survival, conformity to a type seems equally the condition of individuality. It is only the occupation of a favorable locality, the possession of useful organs of offence or of defence, etc., that enable the organism to survive at all, and these appertain to it by inheritance. Were there no uniformities, no grouping of characters about a mean, these would be withdrawn. (2) A second objection to the application of natural selection to conduct is that in human society progress is for the most part 'Cf. Stout, A Manual of Psychology, London edition, i899, Vol. II, p. 448.</page><page sequence="9">426 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. due to a process of deliberate selection or rejection of ideas.' Here victories in the domain of politics, science, or religion, are won by sheer intelligence acting with reference to preconceived ends. A new process supervenes upon or supplants natural selection, which is thus again termed by contrast 'blind' and 'mechanical.' But it is an obviously futile proceeding-this effort to gauge the distance which separates a world in which purposive activity plays a part from a world in which natural selection is a control- ling principle, by citing instances of purposive action or evidence that such instances abound. One case is as good as a million, since there is something to be accounted for if a veritable con- trast exists between the 'higher' and the 'lower,' the purposive and the so-called 'mechanical.' If, however, natural selection is not a theory of causes but only of the effect of aggregated causes, the latter may be teleological or 'natural' as far as the principle is concerned. The only question is that which concerns quantita- tive determination, and this again matters not to the principle, which concerns itself with our convenience as little as it does with the causes of variation or the nature of the environment. (3) It is generally admitted that natural selection does not account for the beginning of variations, and this check to its pretensions in the organic world is welcomed by the opponent of natural selection in morals. But if natural selection, in providing for the elimination of unsuitable characters, be a sine qua non of the establishment of the mean which fixes itself in the type or species, it is all-controlling, since its scope is not diminished whatever may be the principles we call to aid. The variations may be fortuitous, or due to a life-force, or consciously initiated, so far as natural selection is concerned, which is only a principle of adaptation through elimination. It is thus in merely a nega- tive sense a principle of origin and growth, in so far as it provides a moving type or shifting average to which the individuals must within limits conform. If, however, it is not a positive principle which must be taken into account for the origin of variations, it is difficult to see why the recognition does not favor rather than hinder its application in morals. 1W. R. Sorley, Recent Tendencies in Ethics, p. 59.</page><page sequence="10">No. 4.] NiJA TURAL SELECTION 427 (4) Other objections, however many, must be set aside, as a fourth concept remains to be considered-that of environment. And this also has been reified. Or, in other words, even by the evolutionist it is given a static and entitive character which pro- foundly affects our interpretation of evolution in ethical theory. Now "the canon of the principle of natural selection is on the face of it relative . . . what is implied is simply a relation to one's surroundings,"' that is, it imports essentially a relation of the individual and of the species to the environment. But what does environment mean? Obviously (a) not the totality of all external conditions, but those only within the geographical range of the species, which will be relatively unchanging or vari- able according as the species is relatively fixed in its habitat or migratory or nomadic, etc. In any case climatic changes, the appearance and disappearance of rival species, and many other conditions render the environment, from an external point of view (b) only relatively stable. The life of the species is de- pendent upon the changing character of external conditions, among which are included competing species, while for the indi- vidual others of its own kind, with which competition takes place, constitute a part of its environment, and the latter is, therefore (c) not precisely that of the species. Now it is generally admitted that "variations in the individual are produced by the influences upon him of varying environment. . . . Of the influence of the environment upon the individual no one has any question."2 And this influence is reciprocal. Even the evolutional ethicist, who in the end may derive ultimate concepts of Life, Health or Strength by reference to a static environment, says that "a species, indeed, does not simply adapt itself to absolutely fixed conditions, like wax poured into a rigid mould. In altering itself it alters to some extent its environment. By extirpating a rival race it sets up a whole series of actions and reactions, implying a readjustment of the whole equilibrium amongst all the races with which it is in contact, and to some extent an alteration in the inorganic world."3 1W. R. Sorley, op. cit., p. 70. 2Conn, op. cit., p. I48. 3Leslie Stephen, The Science of Ethics, p. 79.</page><page sequence="11">428 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. But the fact that by slow increments of change the environment is also altered by the individual is less frequently noted or less frequently held to be of significance. In reality the environment is never, as far as its effect on the individual is concerned, pre- cisely the same after a given reaction or response to external conditions. Thus (d) it is not, dynamically regarded, the mere sum of external conditions which affect the individual, but these conditions plus the effect of the effort for adjustment on the part of the individual. Let us turn for a moment to an analogous process which occurs on a higher plane of evolution. As said, the life of the human individual is lived in constant reference to the social mean of thought and belief which has established itself, so that even "the doctrines of the greatest moral teacher are successful only in proportion as they are congenial to existing sentiments" and "give articulate shape to thoughts already present in the social medium."' But the influence which this medium exerts upon the individual is not only direct but indirect. The erratic theory, the religious or political propaganda, ill-mated to the social en- vironment, are cut off by causes beyond the control of the indi- vidual or party; but as far as the theory itself, or the effort at reconstruction or readjustment, is influenced by the social mean, it is the product of the individual's conception of that mean. The latter is, structurally, a highly complex system of habits of thought, which is constantly modified by fresh experience and new efforts at adjustment to social conditions. Now with the actual environment of the individual, or the social environment, viewed dynamically as affecting him, must always be reckoned this modification-or the actual environment is never the mere aggregate of external influences, but these plus the individual changing concept, and reorganized with reference to this concept. Is the case otherwise in principle in the organic world, even in the absence of a group-concept, presupposing only organic plas- ticity and elemental organic memory? Every reaction leaves the animal with a different situation to confront, while, given a newly acquired habit (say an arboreal habit), its actual environ- 'Leslie Stephen, op. cit., p. I3I.</page><page sequence="12">No. 4.] NA TURAL SELECTION. 429 ment is profoundly altered, though external physical conditions remain practically the same. If we represent the relatively static environment by the symbols A, B, C, D . M, the actual dynamic environment will be A, B, C, E . Mx (x signifying the modification wrought by the habit); for if the animal find food in its arboreal excursions, more will be left on the ground for others and new conditions will arise. If the habit become permanent, and if through imitation (which the organic selection- ists emphasize) or similar pressure of external conditions, others acquire the habit through successive generations, variations may arise favoring continued adaptation to the new mode of life, and these will be selected. Thus by slow increments of change in the environment of the individual the general average of individuals constituting the species is a moving average; and in turn the species, always ultimately through the individual, modifies its environment. The latter is never practically fixed and static, but a moving and dynamic influence. And it is environment solely in this sense that is significant in our use of the term natural selection, an environment whose constituent factors can never be fully ex- hibited in their joint influence. Now it is admitted that natural selection signifies fitness for survival, the fitness being determined by environment through natural selection, which tends to group individuals about a mean or general average. As the environment is constantly changing, it is this changing environment which determines the standard of survival. But, contrariwise, this dynamic environment, of constantly increasing complexity, is regarded by the evolutional ethicist as something which is merely superadded or superimposed upon a permanent environment, one that determines through natural selection the elemental instincts and qualities of the organism, and with regard to these, the standard or criterion, alike of organic and human evolution. Let us, say they, find the laws which are common to man and the amoeba and we shall have the clue to human progress in the future. It is this static conception of environment which occasions the evolutionist atti- tude expressed in the statement that "we must interpret the</page><page sequence="13">430 TSE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. more developed by the less developed,"' the complex in terms of the simple, the higher in terms of the lower. Evolution, however, signifies essentially continuity, a continuity such that the 'higher' may be exhibited as structurally and functionally continuous with the 'lower;' but the conception that the higher has developed out of the lower, or that the lower has evolved with constant reference to a higher, is relative to our purpose merely. We have now to consider the bearing which the above conception of environment has for the determination of ethical criteria within the field of evolutional ethics. B. "The law of nature has but one precept, 'Be strong,' "says Stephen,1 and this may be taken as fairly representative of the concepts which emerge in the development of evolutionist ethical theory. Strength, courage, prudence and other aggressive or self-assertive qualities, are given not only genetic primacy but ethical priority. Life, health, efficiency, fitness for survival, be- come the criteria by reference to which the priority of ethical virtues may be discovered. If natural selection be given place in ethical theory, the standard which it provides must also be accepted, and whatever other principles come into play, that con- duct must be judged morally right which is determined by the principle of survival. Two problems are here suggested: (i) Is survival a sufficient criterion of moral value? (2) Does the acceptance of natural selection in morals require the admission of the above criteria of evolutional ethics? The second of these problems we may consider first. (i) Now if natural selection is relative merely, signifying rela- tionship to environment, those groups of causes summarized by the term, natural selection, must so operate as to 'select' those char- acters which secure the conformity of the individual to the actual dynamic environment in which he lives. Thus, in modern human society, those qualities are selected which secure the individual's adaptation to the complex social environment in which he lives and acts. His existence, not, to be 'sure, as regards mere tenure of life, but as a member of society organic to the whole, is de- pendent upon his possession of those qualities which are essential 'Spencer, Data of Ethics, Ch. i, Sec. 2, p. 5. 2The Science of Ethics, p. I72.</page><page sequence="14">No. 4.] NA TURAL SELECTION. 431 to the continuance of society. In other words, it is conformity to the relatively complex rather than to the relatively simple environmental conditions which is favored by natural selection. Such conformity is secured by adjustments; these, in turn, favor life indirectly through the continuance of the functions which society provides for him as a member, functions without which mere organic instincts and corresponding activities of expression would, on this higher plane, be powerless to secure the end, namely, life, which evolution at lower animal levels seems alone directly to favor. Admittedly, the more complex activities of individuals in modern civilized society, and progress-if there be progress- are dependent upon the integrity of basal instincts which mem- bers of the most complex society have in common with those of the simplest and most primitive. But the fact that such needs and instincts are basal to all mankind does not warrant the in- ference that natural selection directly favors only the continuance of those modes of reaction which satisfy them. At whatever level, the implications of natural selection are always utility, efficiency, fitness for survival because of adaptation, and through adaptation the preservation of a no-wise static mean. But all these conditions are relative to a changing dynamic environment quite other than that which interprets the end as life. We must say either that Life-another reified concept-means differently at different levels of evolution, or that life itself, as the mere continuance of organic processes in the individual, is an end which at higher stages of evolution can be secured only by forms of adjustment that favor primarily other ends than life. In misinterpretation of this relation Professor Sorley says: "Surely it is clear that it is only in the rarest cases that false or inadequate ideas . . . have any tendency to shorten life or weaken health. Bishop Wilberforce was killed by a fall from his horse, not by the triumphant dialectic of Professor Huxley. Sir Richard Owen lived to a patriarchal old age, and did not dis- appear from the face of the earth because he clung to an idea which the best intellect of his time had relinquished. There is nothing in the doctrine of the fixity of the species-if you hold it</page><page sequence="15">432 THE PI/ILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. -which will in the least degree tend to diminish vitality. Natu- ral selection has practically no effect at all in exterminating those who adhere to this idea."' But the principle could hardly be maintained as a universal proposition with the history of the Middle Ages as a witness to the effect which adherence to an idea has had upon the life and health and fortunes of scores of indi- viduals. It would be more to the point to show that the life, liberty or reputation of Bruno, Galileo, Lavoisier, Priestley, Flade, Agrippa, Bekker, and scores of others-among them Colenso, befriended and persecuted by Bishop Wilberforce-were unaf- fected by their adherence to ideas that were incompatible with prevailing beliefs. But persecution, happily infrequent at present, is only inci- dental to the requirement we have been considering. With the growing complexity of human social relations it becomes evident that the expression 'staking one's life' or 'one's all' is no mere figure of speech. So delicate are the adjustments and so intricate the trains of circumstance set in motion by slight mischance, that health and bare life itself depend upon the nicety of these adjustments. If temperance, courage, and other basic qualities are necessary to the preservation of the health, strength, or efficiency of the individual, the scope and exercise of these virtues are in turn dependent upon countless intricate adjustments to social conditions or relations in which the individual is a worker for personal and social ends far removed from that of life itself. However strong and aggressive the individual and prominent the qualities that make for mere preservation of individual existence, the individual and these qualities are not quite the same in all conditions, and in the fulfilment of all functions in society. In contradiction to the evolutionist conception that these morz com- plex-not to say 'higher'-functions and adjustments are mere modes of life-saving, that is, subordinate to the quite general ends of life and health, they seem directed rather to the conserv- ing of life as identified with the correct fulfilment of functions in society. And natural selection-if it be applicable in this sphere-favors by its negation of maladjustments efficiency for 'W. R. Sorley, op. cit., p. 59.</page><page sequence="16">No. 4.] NATURAL SELECTION. 433 the performance of those functions which society is selecting in its progressive definition of life in terms of function. The indi- vidual obtains his own definition of life from his social, or psychi- cal environment, and by his choices identifies his life with the functions consequent upon his definition. Life and personality become one; but to say that the end is life is less significant of the process than to say that it is personality. To define the end in terms of life is much the same as to define a watch in terms of brass and nickel, and to regard escapement, balance-wheel, and main-spring as so many specialized forms of mechanism by means of which time-keepers are seeking the conservation of metal. (2) Is survival an adequate criterion of moral value? Here we are met by an inevitable antinomy between the ideal and the actual, the 'ought' to be and the 'is'; and it seems that from the very nature of morality the contrast must be absolute. Yet that which ought to be is necessarily determined causally within the limits of what is possible of realization with reference to conditions which obtain within the actual, conditions that are the result of a continuous process of evolution. And if evolution applies with- in the sphere of morality, one must hold that what shall be is determined, or has its determinate place, with respect to what has been, or, in other words, that the future is in principle con- tinuous with the past. In this case the ought to be would signify, (a) merely individual recognition of the unattainable, or (b) more or less adequate prevision of the future for which natural selection and survival provide the means. But natural selection is, we have seen, relative to the higher, not to the lower environment; or modes of conduct are selected not with regard to conditions that have become fixed in stereotyped forms, but with reference to a complex social and psychical environment which is always in advance of these. And this is the reason why the record of the past can never accurately forecast the end; for of the social medium which deter- mines always, in its relation to the individual, the direction which evolution shall take, the individual alone is the interpreter. The goal remains an individual one, but the creation of the type is the primary condition of the existence of the individual, and con-</page><page sequence="17">434 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. formity to the type has less a negative and restrictive than a positive significance. Thus to say that natural selection favors the type rather than the individual is to say that it favors that which is the condition of individuality at a given stage of evolu- tion. The type exists only for the individual-to be in him, the individual, in the form of instincts, habits, associative processes -while, in turn, the individual exists only to express in himself the type, as only in so doing can he realize himself as an indi- vidual. Natural selection, in the ethical sphere, at any rate, implies the negation of the individual as an entity opposed to the type, and is thus equally a positive principle, making 'auto- matically' for growth in personality. To be all that men are- were such a thing possible-would satisfy the conditions of unique individuality and ideal personality far more than to be what no other man is-were this also possible. But it is the latter ideal that is dominant in much of the anti-social ethics which, like that of Nietzsche, finds favor in men's sight at the present time. Evolution favors such ethics only when we create fictitious dual- isms like the foregoing, disjoin idealism from the process, and re- instate human egoistic qualities which, however good in them- selves, have long since become organic to other ends.
