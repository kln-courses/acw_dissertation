Summary The type of job change associated with relocation and the type of relocation decision were examined as predictors of post-move attitudes and intentions. Employees who relocated for a lateral or downward job change reported lower perceived organizational support and higher turnover intentions than those who relocated for a promotion. Further, those taking downward moves or moving involuntarily had lower perceptions of support and higher intentions to quit than lateral relocators and voluntary relocators, respectively.

Introduction While trends indicate that lateral and downward job moves are more commonplace (Feldman, 1996; Stroh et al., 1990), as are employer-initiated (involuntary) moves (Dalton, 1997), very little research has examined anything other than voluntary career-enhancing relocations. The few studies that have done so did not compare different types of relocation situations, but rather explored employee attitudes under specific conditions such as plant closings (Cotton and Majchrzak, 1990; Fox and Krausz, 1987), mergers (Summers and Holcombe, 1990), or corporate relocations (Feldman and Bolino, 1998). Moreover, the relocation literature in general has focused almost exclusively on predictors of relocation decision-making or intentions to move (e.g., Brett and Reilly, 1988; Eby and Russell, in press; Turban et al., 1992) rather than examining the consequences of relocationon employees' post-move work attitudes and intentions. As such, there is a gap in the relocation and career management literatures; most notably, the failure to examine whether employees' post-move attitudes and intentions vary as a function of the type of job change associated with relocation (promotion, lateral, downward job change) or the type of relocation decision (voluntary, involuntary). The current study addresses this void in the literature by comparing employees' post-move attitudes and intentions as a function of these two relocation characteristics. If the type of move matters, then the often taken-for-granted * Correspondence to: Lillian T. Eby, Department of Psychology, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, U.S.A.

DEMATTEO assumption that relocation leads to positive outcomes (e.g., Brett, 1982; Pinder and Walter, 1984) may be questioned and researchers will be encouraged to consider relocation characteristics in future research. With organizations relocating employees for more reasons than ever before-to start-up new operations, quell job losses due to downsizing, transfer employees due to a merger or restructuring, and relocate their operations (Greenberg et al., 1994; Feldman and Bolino, 1998)-extending the relocation literature in this manner is both timely and important. Reactions to Job Changes Involving Geographic Relocation Several factors contribute to the intensity and amount of adaptation required by a job change. The degree of novelty and the number of changes occurring simultaneously are particularly important elements in determining individuals' reaction to change (cf. Latack, 1984; Nicholson, 1984). Thus, while all job changes (e.g., promotions, re-assignments in different departments) involve some degree of adaptation, those associated with geographic relocation are unique because they involve both a change in job duties and a change in location (Dalton and Wimbush, 1998). Relocated employees have to concurrently adapt to new co-workers, subordinates, and supervisors, different organizational norms and reporting relationships, and different physical arrangements. At the same time adaptation is required outside the employee's work role (e.g., learning one's way around a new city, adjusting to cultural differences, adopting new non-work routines), magnifying the extent of change encountered. Given these characteristics of geographic moves it is important to examine relocation as a unique type of job change experience. With this in mind, a caveat should be noted. This study only examines reactions to job changes involving relocation. Therefore, it is not possible to tease apart the independent effects of the job change and the relocation experience since the individuals in the present study both relocated and experienced a job change. Hypothesis development While many post-move work attitudes may be relevant, two were examined in the current study: perceived organizational support and turnover intentions. Perceived organizational support represents one element of employees' perceived exchange relationship with their employer (Eisen- berger et al., 1986). It refers to employees' general belief about the organization's concern for them which is fostered by " .. employees' anthropomorphic ascription of dispositional traits to the organization" (Eisenberger et al., 1986, p. 500) and develops from the actions that agents of the organizations engage in. This includes a wide range of behaviors which generally confer that the company has confidence and faith in the employee's ability and values his or her contributions. Thus, intangible rewards such as praise and approval, as well as tangible rewards such as pay, status, and developmental opportunities all provide signals of the organization's care and concern for the employee (Eisenberger et al., 1986). Characteristics of a relocation situation (e.g., type of job change associated with relocation and type of relocation decision) are expected to send cues to employees about how much they are valued by the organization. For example, a promotion is likely to signal that they are performing well and are valued by the organization. In contrast, employees may interpret lateral or downward job changes as evidence that they are no longer valued by the organization or that Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. J. Organiz. Behav. 21, 677-687 (2000)</page><page sequence="3">TYPE OF MOVE 679 they are headed for a career plateau (Feldman, 1988; Hall and Isabella, 1985). Similarly, if an employee perceives the relocation deicsion as involuntary he or she may harbor resentment toward the organization (Summers and Holcombe, 1990) and view the organization as less caring and supportive. Hypothesis la: Employees who relocate for a promotion will report stronger perceptions of organizational support than those who relocate for a lateral job change or downward job change. Hypothesis lb: Employees who relocate for a lateral job change will report stronger perceptions of organizational support than those who relocate for a downward job change. Hypothesis 2: Employees who characterize their decision to relocate for the organization as voluntary will report stronger perceptions of organizational support than those who charac- terize their relocation decision as involuntary. The second post-move variable of interest is turnover intentions. Turnover intentions refer to the intent to reduce work role involvement by leaving the organization and seeking employment elsewhere (Roznowski and Hulin, 1992). As such, turnover intentions are a proximal precursor of actual turnover behaviors (Cotton and Tuttle, 1986). The literature on voluntary turnover suggests that employees' post-move turnover intentions may vary based on characteristics of the move. For instance, turnover is associated with dissatisfaction with advancement opportunities, job challenge, and pay (e.g., Cotton and Tuttle, 1986). These job characteristics are less likely to be associated with a job change following relocation which is lateral or downward, compared to a promotion. In fact, in situations other than promotions, and particularly in downward moves, an employee may lose pay and status (Isabella and Hall, 1984), implying that intentions to leave may be especially high among this group of relocators. Whether or not the move is perceived as voluntary or involuntary may also be important. Involuntary moves are typically associated with mergers, plant closings, and downsizings (Cotton and Majchrzak, 1990; Fox and Krausz, 1987). Under these conditions employees may perceive that they are forced to move and have few options other than to relocate for the organization. The perceived lack of choice in such situations may embitter some employees and lead them to reduce their psychological investment in the organization. Consistent with the literature on organizational attachment (e.g., Mowday et al., 1982), one manifestation of lowered psycho- logical investment is expected to be heightened turnover intentions. Hypothesis 3a: Employees who relocate for a promotion will report lower turnover intentions than those who relocate for a lateral job change or downward job change. Hypothesis 3b: Employees who relocate for a lateral job change will report lower turnover intentions than those who relocate for a downward job change. Hypothesis 4: Employees who characterize their decision to relocate for the organization as voluntary will report lower turnover intentions than those who characterize their relocation decision as involuntary. It is also possible that the type of job change following relocation and type of relocation decision interact in more complex ways. For instance, involuntary decisions that also represent downward job changes may have a more negative effect on perceptions of support and turnover intentions than downward moves that are perceived as voluntary. Or, voluntary moves that are promotions may be associated with stronger perceptions of support than voluntary lateral moves. To explore this possibility, the following research questions are posed: Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. J. Organiz. Behav. 21, 677-687 (2000)</page><page sequence="4">680 L. T. EBY AND J. S. DEMATTEO Research Question 1: Is there an interaction between the type of job change following relocation and type of relocation decision on perceptions of organizational support? Research Question 2: Is there a significant interaction between the job change following relocation and type of relocation decision on turnover intentions? Method Sample and procedure Data used for the current study were part of a larger study of job-related relocation. This larger project used couple-level data to examine predictors of willingness to relocate among married employees (Eby and Russell, in press). It should be noted that none of the variables examined in the current study overlap with this larger project and the hypotheses examined here are unique. Organizations eligible to participate in the study included any company in the greater metro- politan area of the consulting firm sponsoring the study. Branch offices of the sponsoring firm contacted local organizations by a variety of methods (e.g., contacting existing clients, pro- fessional organizations, mailings) and asked if they would be interested in participating in a university-based nationwide study of job-related relocation. Interested organizations contacted the researchers directly. The objective of the sampling method was to maximize external validity by obtaining a sample of organizations that was diverse in terms of size, annual revenue, industry, employment sector, and geographic location. Since the sponsoring firm had over 90 branch offices across the United States and Canada, in large metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City, Philadelphia), midsized cities (e.g., Columbus, Ohio, Greenville, SC), and smaller towns (e.g., Wethersfield, CT; Princeton, NJ), our sampling objective was successful. Participating organizations included 74 different companies representing 11 industries (e.g., banking, energy, manufacturing, transportation, communications), four employment sectors (public, 72.7 per cent; private, 21.4 per cent; government, 3.8 per cent; non- profit, 2.1 per cent), and various areas of the United States (south, 15.3 percent; northeast, 14.0 per cent; midwest, 26.4 per cent; west, 27.7 per cent) and Canada (16.6 per cent). Organizations also varied widely in terms of the number of offices worldwide (M = 133, range = 1-999), the number of employees worldwide (M = 83,137, range = 155-750,000) and corporate annual revenue (M = U.S. $20.1 million, range U.S. $854,179-$132.4 billion). Survey packets were sent to organizations for distribution to employees who had recently relocated (over 75 per cent of the sample had moved in the two years prior to data collection). Organizational representatives responsible for survey distribution were instructed to either send surveys to all relocated employees (if 500 employees or under) or to randomly sample individuals representative of the total population of employees that had recently relocated (if over 500 employees). Four thousand eight hundred and fifty surveys were distributed, and after follow-up letters to organizations reminding them to distribute surveys to their employees, usable surveys were returned by 1873 employees yielding a 39 per cent response rate. From this initial sample, 308 employees were excluded from further consideration because they were new hires who had relocated to join the company. The final sample consisted of 1565 employees who had worked for the organization for an average of 11.4 years (SD = 7.9) and were employed in a wide range of jobs (e.g., general management, information systems, communications, finance). The average age of participants was 38.5 (SD = 7.9), 77 per cent were male, and 70 per cent were currently married. The median education level was a college degree, the modal salary was U.S. $50,000-$75,000, and participants had moved an average of 2.9 times (SD = 2.2). Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

First, information was obtained from organizational representatives on the characteristics of the employees initially sent surveys (in addition to background information on their company such as industry, size, etc.) to compare respondents to the total sample. No differences were found in terms of employee age, marital status, pay level, and education level. Second, respondents were compared to another large-scale study of employee relocation (Brett et al., 1990). Our sample was highly similar to Brett et al.'s in terms of marital status and spouse work status, yet our sample was slightly older, more likely to be female, and slightly less educated. These discrepant findings should be considered in light of changing demographic trends since 1989 and the more diverse nature of the organizations included in the present study. Taken together, these comparisons indicated little evidence of response bias. Measures Control variables Several variables were used to help control for differences across organizations, as well as differences in mobility rates among employees as a function of the types of jobs and positions held. This included measures of functional area, pay level, employment sector, and organizational size. In addition, effects associated with time since the most recent move (in months) were controlled since: (1) perceptions of organizational support are expected to change over time, (2) the passage of time means that events other than the relocation may influence work reactions, and (3) as time since the move increases so does the possibility of recall problems. Functional area, pay level, and employment sector were assessed using a forced choice format. Organization size was determined by an open-ended question asking for the total number of employees worldwide. Organization size and employment sector data were obtained by the background information survey completed by an organizational representative and the remaining control variables were obtained from the employee survey. Nonsense coding (Cohen and Cohen, 1983), where a unique but arbitrary value is assigned to each category, was used for the variables of functional area and employment sector since we were not interested in interpreting these effects, only partialling out the associated variance. The raw number of months indicated the amount of time since the relocation and pay level was coded such that higher values indicated higher salaries. Characteristics of the most recent relocation Employees answered several questions regarding their most recent relocation experience. First, they were asked, 'What characterizes your most recent relocation experience?' The response options were: promotion (n = 695, 47.7 per cent), lateral move (n = 707, 48.6 per cent), downward move (n = 54, 3.7 per cent). Next, employees were asked, 'How would you describe your relo- cation decision?' Response options were: voluntary (n = 1132, 90 per cent) and involuntary (n = 126, 10 per cent). Numerical discrepancies between the number of employees responding to these questions represent missing data. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. J. Organiz.

DEMATTEO Post-move perceptions, perceived organizational support and turnover intentions A shortened version of Eisenberger et al.'s (1986) 16-item short form of the Perceived Organ- izational Support measure assessed employee perceptions of support. Using a strategy similar to that reported by Eisenberger et al. (1990), four items with the highest factor loadings were selected to represent this construct (e.g., 'The organization really cares about my well-being at work'). A coefficient alpha reliability estimate of 0.90 was obtained for this 4-item measure. Cammann, Finchman, Jenkins and Klesh's (unpublished data) 3-item scale was used to measure Turnover Intentions (e.g., 'I often think about quitting my job'; a = 0.84). Both constructs were measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). Results Means, standard deviations, and correlations among study variables are presented in Table 1. An analysis of covariance (ancova) revealed a significant main effect for type of job change following relocation (F(2,1130) = 19.55, p&lt; 0.001) and type of relocation decision (F(1,1130) = 33.91, p &lt; 0.001) on perceptions of organizational support. Planned comparisons assessed mean differences (adjusted for the covariates) in perceived organizational support as a function of these two relocation characteristics. Table 2 presents these adjusted means for perceived organizational support and the associated standard errors (see columns 1 and 2). Hypotheses la, Ib, and 2 were supported. Employees who experienced a job change that was a promotion (M = 4.68) reported significantly higher perceptions of organizational support than those who made a lateral (M = 4.36, p &lt; 0.001) or downward (M = 3.53, p &lt; 0.001) job change. Further, lateral movers expressed significantly higher perceptions of organizational support than those who made a downward move (p &lt; 0.001). Finally, employees who described their relocation decision as voluntary (M = 4.55) expressed higher perceptions of organizational support than those who described their decision as involuntary (M = 3.82; p &lt; 0.001). No support was found for Research Question 1 since the interaction between type of job change following relocation and type of decision was not significant for perceived organizational support (F(2, 1130) = 1.44, n.s.).

Planned comparisons assessed mean differences in turnover intentions by type of job change and type of relocation decision (see Table 2, columns 3 and 4). Employees for whom the relocation involved a promotion (M = 2.62) expressed lower turnover intentions than those who made a lateral (M = 3.01, p &lt; 0.001) or downward job change (M = 4. 15, p &lt; 0.001) supporting Hypothesis 3a. In addition, lateral moves were associated with significantly lower turnover intentions than downward moves (p &lt; 0.001), supporting Hypothesis 3b. Consistent with Hypothesis 4, employees who described their most recent relocation decision as voluntary (M = 2.90) expressed significantly lower turnover intentions than those who described their decision as involuntary (M = 3.62, p &lt; 0.001). With regard to Research Question 2, the inter- action between type of move and type of decision was non-significant (F(2, 1126) = 1.14, n.s.). Discussion The current study examined a previously unexplored aspect of job-related relocation; how characteristics of the relocation situation relate to post-move attitudes and intentions. The findings strongly suggest that the type of move matters. When relocations involved lateral or downward job changes, or reflected a decision that employees perceived as involuntary, their perception of organizational support was weakened and their turnover intentions were stronger. This implies that future research needs to carefully consider the type of move in studies of employee relocation and job mobility in order to fully understand the complexity of job-related relocation. The pattern of findings presented here is consistent with numerous theoretical orientations rather than any one in particular. As such, several possible explanations are briefly discussed below in order to provide a springboard for future empirical and theoretical work. While not exhaustive of the different theories (e.g., reinforcement theory) that may be useful in interpreting Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. J. Organiz. Behav. 21, 677-687 (2000)</page><page sequence="8">684 L. T. EBY AND J. S. DEMATTEO our results, those chosen for discussion were selected based on their ability to help us understand the possible psychological processes underlying the current study's findings. Social exchange theory predicts that an important element in assessing satisfaction with, and the desire to remain in, a relationship is the balance of rewards versus costs associated with that relationship (Thibaut and Kelley, 1959). It follows that an employee who relocated for a lateral or downward job change would be more likely to perceive an imbalance and report stronger intentions to terminate the employment relationship and/or reduce their psychological investment in the organization. As such, future research may want to explicitly examine social exchange variables such as the availability of alternatives (e.g., labor market conditions, perceptions of skill marketability), equity perceptions, and investment in the employment relationship (e.g., tenure, calculative commitment). The literature on the psychological contracts makes similar predictions about the process by which job-related relocations may impact work attitudes and intentions (Rousseau, 1989). Also based on the notion of balanced exchanges, a psychological contract represents a subjectively defined reciprocal agreement among two parties which consists of beliefs and expectations each party holds about the relationship (Rousseau, 1989). Relocation situations that do not lead to fair exchanges or are perceived as forced by the organization may lead to perceptions of contract violations, which in turn may affect post-move attitudes and intentions. Suggestions for future research that emerge from this orientation include the measurement of both employee and employer expectations to capture contract perceptions and the assessment of patterns of employee-employer relations at multiple points in time following relocation. While conceptually similar to psychological contracts, the construct of met expectations, appears to represent a distinct psychological process (Turnley and Feldman, presentation pre- sented at 1998 annual meeting of Academy of Management). Met expectations refers to the process by which individuals compare their current situation to what they expected from the organization. When individuals' expectations are not met, they typically report lower job sat- isfaction and commitment, reduced effort, and higher turnover (Wanous et al., 1992). In fact, McElroy et al. (1996) found that when employees sought and were denied internal mobility opportunities not requiring relocation they reported less favorable work attitudes than those who had their mobility expectations met. Extending McElroy et al.'s (1996) findings to the study of characteristics of job-related relocations, it appears as if the met expectations framework may have some utility for understanding post-move attitudes and intentions. Finally, cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957) provides a very different explanation for our findings. Specifically, given how the type of job change following relocation was measured in the present study it is possible that respondents were engaging in dissonance reduction when reporting this information (e.g., 'Since I moved for the organization I must have gotten something in return for it'). Further, sometimes downward moves are not labelled as such to reduce the stigma associated with them (Feldman, 1988). Thus, more subtle measures of the type of job change following relocation may be useful in future research. Measures of re-employment quality which compare the previous and new job in terms of factors such as job responsibility, pay, and status (Eby and Buch, 1994) or measures of career and job content plateauing (Chao, 1990) may be useful in such efforts. Several other findings deserve brief mention. First, neither research question indicated sig- nificant interactions between the type of job change following relocation and the type of relocation decision. This implies that the effects of these variables are additive rather than multiplicative. Second, it is worth noting that correlation between the type of job change following relocation and the type of decision was relatively weak (r = -0.20, see Table 1). To better understand this finding, cross-tabulations between these two variables were examined. In terms of those moves Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. J. Organiz. Behav. 21, 677-687 (2000)</page><page sequence="9">TYPE OF MOVE 685 described as voluntary, 55 per cent were promotions, 42 per cent were lateral moves, and the remaining 3 per cent were described as downward moves. Substantial variability was also found with respect to involuntary moves; 19 per cent reported that these moves were promotions, 77 per cent lateral moves, and the remaining 3 per cent downward moves. These findings underscore the importance of carefully considering characteristics of the relocation situation since voluntary moves are clearly not always promotions, just as involuntary moves are not always demotions. This pattern of finding is in line with anecdotal reports that employees often feel pressured to move for their organization. Even in the case of promotions employees sometimes believe that if a relocation offer is not accepted they will be dead-ended in their career (Feldman, 1988). Conversely, there are situations where employees may voluntarily take downward moves. For example, employees may choose a downward move to reduce job stress, have more time for non- work interests, or to continue to use the knowledge and relationships they have developed in the organization (Isabella and Hall, 1984). Limitations and conclusions Many of the limitations of this study involve methodological and measurement-related issues. One involves the use of single source data. Researchers disagree regarding the threat of common method bias associated with single source data, yet note that when respondents are reporting objective, verifiable information (e.g., type of job change) there is less of a threat to internal validity (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). In addition, the relatively low correlations among study variables suggests that common method bias is not likely to be a major concern here (see Table 1). A second limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the data. Current perceptions of organizational support or intent to turnover may lead employees to report the move as more or less desirable, rather than these work attitudes being an outcome of the type of move. While certainly plausible, theoretical writing on the topic argues that perceptions of support are shaped through specific organizational experiences and actions on the part of the organization toward the employee rather than being an antecedent of how organizational events are interpreted (Eisenberger et al., 1986, 1990). A third limitation is the small number of individuals who reported taking downward career moves and involuntary relocations. While it has been suggested that these types of job changes are on the rise they still appear to represent a small percentage of all relocation-related job changes. Relatedly, since our sample included only individuals with experience relocating, gen- eralizations should not be made to non-movers. Fourth, while we controlled for several variables, some of these variables (e.g., functional area), as well as others such as employee age or gender, might be interesting to explore in relation to the type of job change and type of decision. For instance, are certain job functions more likely to be associated with involuntary job moves than others? Or, do males and females differ in the types of job changes they experience following relocation? These are interesting avenues for future research. Fifth, due to the research design we were not able to tease apart the effects of the relocation from the actual job change. This would require a comparison of relocators (who also experienced a job change) to job changers who did not relocate. A final set of limitations involve the lack of information on the processes underlying the study's findings. While we were able to determine that perceptions of organ- izational support are important in understanding reactions to different types of moves, future research should examine the psychological processes linking characteristics of the move to post- move outcomes. Recent trends indicate that fewer promotional opportunities will be available in organizations Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. J. Organiz. Behav. 21, 677-687 (2000)</page><page sequence="10">686 L. T. EBY AND J. S. DEMATTEO (Feldman, 1996). In light of these changes, strong pleas have been made for researchers to examine the outcomes of job-related moves (Dalton, 1997; Dalton and Wimbush, 1998), and consider the type of move in relocation research (Feldman and Bolino, 1998). The current study answered these calls for research by investigating differences in employees' post-move attitudes and turnover intentions as a function of the type of job change following relocation (promotion, lateral, downward) and type of relocation decision (voluntary, involuntary). As expected, sig- nificant differences were found as a function of these two variables, highlighting the need for future research to carefully consider the characteristics of the relocation experience in order to fully understand the impact of relocation on employees' attitudes and intentions.
