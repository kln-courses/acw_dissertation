<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES NEW QUESTIONS AND OLD PARADIGMS: REEXAMINING CARIBBEAN CULTURE HISTORY William J. Pestle, L. Antonio Curet, Reniel Rodriguez Ramos, and Miguel Rodríguez López One of the central goals of archaeology is the definition of regional cultural succession. Since at least the 1960s, archae ology has purported to have moved beyond the strictures of Culture History, and yet the constructs ofthat paradigm (styles, periods, cultures) continue to be used routinely. This work aims to show that by doing so, one is still implicitly subscribing to that theoretical perspective's assumptions and biases. In the end, this article is intended to be a self-critical assessment of the shortcomings of Caribbean archaeology vis-ä-vis issues inherent in that region's dominant culture-history frame work. Moreover, it aims to provide an example for Caribbeanists, and archaeologists working in other regions, of the value of moving beyond the products of, and not just beyond the term, Culture History. Definir la sucesión de culturas a niveles regionales ha formado, y en muchos casos sigue formando, una de las metas cen trales de la arqueología. Desde por lo menos los 1960s, la arqueología ha reclamado que ha superado las limitaciones del paradigma de Historia Cultural, pero sus construcciones (estilos, periodos, culturas) continúan siendo usadas regularmente. El presente trabajo tiene el propósito de demostrar que al seguir utilizando estas construcciones, el investigador implícita mente sigue adscribiéndose a las premisas y prejuicios de esa posición teórica. La intención principal de este trabajo es una autocrítica de los problemas de la arqueología caribeña concernientes a las problemáticas inherentes en el marco teórico de la Historia Cultural que sigue siendo utilizado en la región. Aún más, tiene la finalidad de proveer un ejemplo para los arqueó logos del Caribe, y para arqueólogos trabajando en otras regiones, sobre el valor de sobrepasar no tan sólo el nombre His toria Cultural, sino también sus productos.

In working toward 1960s, heralding a break from Culture History, and this goal, techniques (e.g., typologies, seriation, have argued that Caribbean archaeology is poised stratigraphic excavations) were developed to detect for a new era of discovery, one that is free of the variation and patterns in artifact attributes and encumbrances of Culture History's worldview. assemblages in the archaeological record.

Styles represent local modal manifestations (Rodriguez 2007:36), and the various styles take the name of the site in which they were first dis covered. Critically, as Rouse construed them, styles represent both the material assemblage of a given place and time (typically ceramics), and, with the addition of information regarding other aspects of a group's lifeways, the people and cul ture that created them (Curet 2004; Petersen et al. 2004; Rouse 1990,1992).

While these mixed deposits have often been thought to be the result of a lack of contextual integrity (see, e.g., lengthy discussion in Rodríguez et al. 2008), we now find ourselves free to embrace the fact that they might actually indicate the coeval performance of mul tiple pottery-making traditions. Notwithstanding the effects of cultural or natural formation processes, perhaps such contemporaneity of cul tural manifestations indicates the presence of mul tiethnic or plural contexts. While differentiating between mixing (which does happen) and true plu rality may not be straightforward, the widespread coexistence of pottery of supposedly distinct styles (as in the examples presented in Rodríguez et al. 2008) ought to be given serious consideration rather than being dismissed ahistorically as a few "intrusive" sherds. Fourth, in developing local chronologies, we should not make the error of the Culture Histori ans, who, in the abstract, realized that total cultural change was not the rule, but in practice often assumed the universality of the systems they devised (e.g., Rouse equating changes in ceramic style with evolutions and revolutions in ethnic, political, and social realms). How things are orga nized across space and time will likely change depending on the sort of research questions being asked. This perspective acknowledges that not everything in a specific region changes at the same time. Thus, some changes in the archaeological record may reflect changes in social organization, whereas others might reflect differences in ideol ogy, environment, or economy, none of which nec essarily happened at the same time or produced similar effects (see previous discussion of stylis tic/technological change related to, and separate from, changes in ethnicity). This is the phenome non that Braudel (1974:57) referred to as the plu rality of historical time. In conclusion, work aimed at constructing new culture histories must (a) be carried out with strong reference to absolute chronology, (b) keep an open mind to overlap, hybridism, creolization, and plu rality, (c) work bottom-up, and (d) be open to alter ation, depending on the research questions at hand. As such, we must consciously and explicitly reject all of the enumerated assumptions of Culture His tory, embrace the fuzziness of our bounded cultural groups, and not fetishize the constructs that we develop. We must remember that what we are cat aloging is nothing more than a shared set of mate rial cultural manifestations, and that such shared sets of modes or types or styles need not connote com monality of belief nor heritage. By these means, the construction of our culture histories might finally be free of the shadow of Culture History. Acknowledgments.

In this paper, when we refer to Culture History (with initial capitals), we are referring to the paradigm (Kuhn 1962) that dominated American archaeology through the first half of the twentieth century. The Culture Historical method refers to the premises, strategies, and methods used by adherents of the Culture History paradigm in developing culture histories. Finally, by culture history/histories (uncapitalized), we refer to the chronological sequence of material manifestations in a particular location/region/site (e.g., the culture history of Alabama). This product (culture history) need not be the</page><page sequence="19">Pestle et al.] REEXAMINING CARIBBEAN CULTURE HISTORY 261 result of the Cultural Historical method, as alternative premises, strategies, and methods can be used to develop such chronological sequences. 2. It is important to note that here we refer solely to methodology and not to techniques (which, while related to methodology, are severable from them). We agree that tech niques developed by the early Culture Historians to detect and track changes in the archeological record (stratigraphy, seriation, classifications) are excellent contributions and landmarks in the history of archaeology (see Trigger 2009:309). 3. Although it is possible that the marine reservoir effect could be making individuals with higher marine protein con sumption appear older (radiometrically) and those without younger, the magnitude of the temporal difference observed in this skeletal series is far greater than that attributable to such a cause. For example, employing a mixed marine cali bration curve, a 60 percent shift from marine to terrestrial protein (80-20 versus 20-80, a dramatic shift by any mea sure) only produces a ca.180 year change in calibrated median probability AMS date. This is dwarfed by the over 600-year range observed in the calibrated median probability AMS dates of the Punta Candelera skeletons.
