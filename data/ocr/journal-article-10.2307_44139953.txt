<plain_text><page sequence="1">TERRACOTTA ART IN HARYANA Mohinder Singh ( Kurukshetra ) 1.1 Terracotta art has been described as common man's art. Some of these terracotta figurines must have been worshipped as house-hold deities. Some were votive offerings, some must have carried purely decorative purpose, while a large number of them must have been mere play things of children.1 1.2 The terracottas, therefore, offer valuable evidence on amusements, pastimes, dress and ornaments. Association and domination of the alien races and vissicitudes of fortune so common in political history have also left their imprint on this humble art.2 Terracotta art finds mention in the Harsha Charita of Bana,8 in Kashyapa Samhita4, and Naradiya Samhita .5 The easy availability, and plasticity of clay made it an important medium of art expression. The rich alluvium of the Indo-Gangetic plain provided the suitable raw material for art and good many centers developed in northern India. 1.3 The history of terracotta art in Haryana begins in the Harappan pe- riod. Excavations conducted at Siswal, Mitathal,6 Banawali,7 Daulatpur, Raja Karan Ka Qila and Bhagwanpura have yielded many objects which throw welcome light on the art tradition of the people of this region in the 3rd. millennium B.C. The terracottas from the Harappan period (Urban) are representations of animals or human beings. The animal terracottas from these sites included small figurines of bulls, buffaloes deer, dogs, rhinoceros and birds. Some of these are representations of ram-headed and bird bodied figurines having lateral perforation for the use of wheels and longitudinal hold for passing a stick or rope across for traction. The animals are distinguished by their horns as bull or ram.8 Similar figurines were also found from the Harappan sites in the Indus Valley9 and Gujrat. Terracotta figurines continued to be made in the post-Harappan period also. They have been found from Mitathal</page><page sequence="2">167 II B10, Daulatpur I11 and other sites in this region. But these are much less in number as compared to the earlier Harappan period. Besides, the toys of the mature Harappan period were better made than those of the Late and Post-Harappan period. 1.4 - Some of these toys at Mitathal were painted on the back with cross-hatched or oblique lines representing the wings.12 The holes of bull figurines arc also painted with black strokes. The animal figurines • from Banawali II represent humped bull, ram, buffalo, deer, dog and rhinoceros.13 There were birds in the collection too. Wheeled toys representing animal and bird headed figurines from the post Harappan period are commonly found in Hary ana and Western U.P.14 Figurines with horned bull and ram heads have been found from Mitathal II-B15 and a wheeled bird is reporied from Daulatpur I. Other terracotta animal figurines from this period include a dog from Mitathal II-B, 16 humped bulls painted with black pigment from Daulatpur I17 and Mijza- pur I.18 Another interesting fragmentany terracotta object possibly representing a snake has been found from Mirzapur. These terracottas from Northern Haryana are cruder than those round from Banawali, Mitathal II-A and Rakhigarhi. 1.5 A few terracotta anthropomorphic figurines and incised rams have been found from the Painted Grey Ware period from Bhagwanpura. These fill up the gap in terracotta modelling activity between the Harappan and the Mauryan times.19 1.6 The terracotta figurines from the Mauryan period from Sugh are crudely modelled and seem to be related to the mother Goddess cult. Ą small figurine from Sugh shows a crudely executed head and bust. The nose is pinched and its ridge extends right up to the head. Small lateral slits on either side maik the eyes. An incised cross resembling the sign of multiplication represents perhaps a necklace. The breasts are shown prominently and the arms and legs are stumpy and featureless.*0 Another female figurine is broken above the navel. The navel cavity is shown by a perforated mark made with a pointed tool. It is shown wearing broad applique indented girdle.21 1.7 A few of the figurines come from Sugh and show a bird face and human body. This tradition was also prevalent in the proto-historic</page><page sequence="3">168 times. A number of hand modelled female figurines are stunted figures with narrow waist and broad hips surrounded by a girdle represented by an indented applied band. The figurines are crudely modelled and the features indicated pinched facial expressions. This group belongs to the ageless variety according to Stella-Kramrisch and reflects the art of the general masses.22 1.8 The animal figurines include elephants, bulls, horses and rams. The elephant figurines have prominent tamples, lozenge shaped eyes with punch marked pupil in the centre. The figurines are decorated with applied bands or incised bands on the back, stampped leaf, chakra, circle or punched motifs.2* Some of these figurines have a hole in the back of the animal to fix the rider to the seat. Some-times these were provided with wheels. Such type of figurines have also been found from Ahichchhatra and Hastinapur.24 The horses of this period are shown with elongated neck and are decorated with incised slashes and lines.25 Another figurine of a ram has coiled horns bearing deep inci- sed lines, with holes across the body meant for joining the wheels and another hole near the coiled horns for the setting for pulling them for- ward.26 The animal figurines are beautiful pieces of art. 1.9 The post Mauryan age is one of the most glorious epochs in the history of the evolution of Indian plastic art. Besides, the hand mode- lled human and animal forms, a large number of moulded figurines belonging to the Sunga period have been discovered from various sites in Haryana as well. The lotus and the Yakshi from Sugh represent cult terracottas. Besides, there are many female figurines shown with a variety of apparel and jewellery. Most of these are shown standing in graceful postures. Some others indicate female parts prominently, perhaps suggesting their links with some fertility cult. A female from Sugh represents the mother standing among the rolling children while another depicts a child in their lap.27 Besides these, a figurine of trinetra Siva28 and Vishnu29 have also been reported from this period. A figurine of a Yogi is also interesting. 1.10 A broken figurine depicting a seated child holding a wooden board (Takhti) on which are written vowels in Brahmi script of the Sunga period is a beautiful piece of art.3» A terracotta plaque from Sugh depicts musicians and dancers travelling in a bulock-cart.81 A seated</page><page sequence="4">169 camel adorned with floral designs from Chhapra village (District Sonepat)32 and a figurine from Sugh23 are the other important pieces found. 1.1 1 A number of secular figurines have also been found from Haryana. Some among these depict royal personages.34 There is a wrestling scene from Amin.35 A warrior killing a lion is reported from Nauranga- bad.36 1.12 The Kushana terracotta figurines can be classified into three catf gories on stylistic grounds. One of the categories includes human figurines with mixed ethnic pictures-Hellenistic, Scythian and Indian elements. Their emergence reflects co-mingling of different peoples and cultures due to historical reasons. A male-head with a long nose flatte- ned lips, protruding eyes, a ribbon around the head for proper dressing of hair and an ovaloid ace depicts Kushans features.37 Another male head represents an interesting mixture of Hellenstic and Indian elemen- ts showing lozenge eyes, oval face, pinched ears, long moustaches and a turban over the head in indigenous style.33 In another case a male head depicts Indo-Greek features with a hand around the head and the lower end with seven angular designs artistically shown in his peculiar head dress.39 An interesting male figurine represents scytho-parthian elements, It has an oval face, slightly protruding eyes, prominent nose, marked chin and a Kuhla cap similar 'o the Iranian head gear with protruding top and criss-cross design.40 A specimen from Pehowa represents a royrl personage sitting on the throne. The folds of the dra- pery suggest Gandhara influence.41 1.13 In some of the terracotta figurines is noticed a tendency for showing elaborate hair-do in the Kushana tradition.48 A terracotta head from Thanesar wears a high pointed Kuhla cap resembling the Indo-Scythian head gear.43 It is a unique cap so far as this depicts a number of small dotted squares alongwith the horizontal band and the painted top. 1.14 Terracotta art reached its zenith in the Gupta period in repect of technical perfection and refinement. A few examples of this period have been discovered from Pehowe, Sugh, Thanesar, Naurangabad, Nacharkh- era and Agroha. These samples indicate the themes and norms set by the</page><page sequence="5">170 potterartist of the Ganga-Yamuna Doab. The mould made terracotta of the period include plaques from Sugh showing graceful human figures.44 The plaques depicting female figurines (Salabhanjika) were meant for house decoration.43 Mahishasurmardini46 from Naurangabad and Durga, Lakshmi47 and Asvamukhi Kinnari48 bearing bell shaped orna- ments represented the cult art. A mould made medallion from Khokharakot49 depicts on the obverse three human (male) figures with a common head. The medallion speakes of the creative mind of the local potter-artist who had successfully executed the motifē 1.15 A terracotta female head from Khokharakot has a charming face, and the hair is arranged in Gupta style.50 Similar figurines have been discovered from Ahichchhatra,51 Rajghat52 and Kumrahar.53 Another interesting type of female figurine is that of a Naigamesa54 explored by the author from Khokharakot. It has a face with goat-like features and long dangling ears, hooked nose and a deep cut. It has been iden- tified with Shasthi, the consort of Skanda and the guardian of children. This type had a wide distribution in north India as specimens have been found from Mathura,55 Ahichchhatra,56 Rajghat,57 Kaushambi53 and Kumrahar.59 1.16 Besides, these there have also been found terracottas depicting the Ramayana scenes which once decorated the temples. Thaneswar,00 Pehowa61 and Nadharkehra62 have yielded relics suggesting the existence of brick temples adorned with acrved brick panels showing various themes and designs in the Gupta style. Two of the seven panels from Nacharkhera also bear early Gupta period inscriptions. Similar panels depicting scenes from the Ramayana have been found from Deogarh,63 Chausa64 and Saheth-Meheth,65 which according to Vogel66 formed a continous frieze on the wall most probably of the Vishnu temple. 1.17 The terracottas of the early medieval period from Haryana have a different flavour and treatment. A broken piece represents a bust of an elephant with broken tusk and inside A caprisoned horse with broken head and legs wears an inside necklace as a part of decora- tion.67 A fragment of a pot depicting the face of a monkey and a small figure of a seated bull with decoration on the neck, probably meant as the Vahana of Siva, were reported from Thanesar;68 The bull figurine from Sugh shows the details sharply. Some birds figurines have been</page><page sequence="6">171 found from Sugh and Naurangabad.69 These show pinched mouth and scales on their bodies drawn by small incised lines. Some bird figuri- nes from Sugh show apertue for fixing the wheels. This tradition can be traced back to the pre-Harappan and Harappan times in India. 1.18 Conclusions: 1. Hary ana has a long tradition of terracotta art going back to the Chalcolithic period. 2. Terracotta art mainly flourished during Periods of urban prosperity during the Harappan and the Maurvan-Kushana periods. 3. Terracotta art becomes an important vehicle of religious beliefs and ideas, particularly during the early historic period. 4. This art throws light on the secular mode of life during the Urban periods. To conclude, scientific study of terracotta art can go a long way in the reconstruction of social, economic and cultural life of the past. NOTES &amp; REFERENCES 1 Kala, S.
