Poetry - both the lyric shi f$ and rhapsodic fu K or its prototypes - began to burgeon along with prose; prose and verse alike showed evidence of conscious literary technique, while subject matter and rhetorical possibilities expanded as part of the tumultuous rise of the Hundred Schools of philosophy. The Eastern Zhou influenced later literature on a mammoth scale, but particularly in the various subgenres that together com- prise the Han rhapsody or fu. The fu is largely rooted in three kinds of Zhou literature: the northern Shi jing !#g (Poetry Classic or Book of Odes), the southern Chu ci ÎË8Î (Songs of Chu), and the philosophical prose writings of 1 Preface to "Fu on Two Capitals" ("Liang du fu" ffi SßR), in Wen Xuan ÍCM (Guoxue jiben congshu Salili ed., Hong Kong: Commercial Press, 1973) 1/1 (hereafter abbreviated as WX).

This article proposes to examine that latter chain of influ- ence, from the prose of the Hundred Schools into the rhapsodies of the Han. Absorption and Mingling of Confucian and Taoist Thought It is generally acknowledged that, of all the philosophical schools, it was Confu- cianism and Taoism (if we define them broadly) that did the most to shape Han culture, including the fu. This process was part of a complex interweaving of values that gave Han culture much of its vitality. Confucianism and Taoism, which had begun as mutually exclusive or even antithetical modes of thought, mingled once they fell under the Han's unifying sway. "Action" (you wei ~féM) and "non-action" (wu wei f&amp;fà) no longer confronted each other, but could be seen simply as two principles that coexisted on a continuum of legitimate ap- proaches toward ordering the empire. Likewise, the social choice of "being in the world" (ru shi A 1ft) could alternate with "staying out of the world" {bi shi S 1ft) within one person's life plan. Han rhapsodists pondered complementary paths of "commitment" {/in M) and "retreat" (tui j§ ), as they formed principles by which to establish themselves and live among humanity. Among these princi- ples, "active service within the world" (ru shi, you wei Atft^S) took after Con- fucius ?L-f and Mencius jfcí; "frustrated aspiration" and "retreat from disaster" {shi zhi, bi huo ^JêSIÎR) drew strength from Laozi ^í and Zhuangzi ff-f ; while "indignant concern for the trends of the age" (fen shi ji su fftB#j£f$) was equally Confucian and Taoist. What propelled Confucian prose, perhaps more than any other idea, was the concept that "the common people are the root."3 This would become the standard by which Han rhapsodists judged the world, remonstrated with their rulers, and advocated change. As the imperial fabric unravelled through the Spring and Autumn era, nobles and commoners grew more polarized, with peril- ous implications for the power of the ruling class. New kinds of thinkers tried to redress that polarization by insisting that the common people - automatically and by their very nature - had to form the focus of all statecraft. "Water floats the ship, and water makes it capsize" (shui ze zai zhou, shui ze fu zhou ?fcpjj &lt;cA, tKBÜBÄ): rulers hold sway by the grace of those they rule.4 A ship's cap- tain should not mistreat the sea. This powerful analogy, supposedly coined by Confucius himself, reached into profound intellectual territory. Mencius even 3 Minben sixiang K*Sffl is a modern formulation, intended to refer to a core of ideas that are prominent in a wide variety of early texts, many of which will be referred to below. See also Zhang Cangshou (cîtS, "Lun Han fu di minben sixiang" HgïRfëg#S$ IHan/" and the Concept of the People as the Root], in Shehui kexue zhanxian jRt#$f¥9i&amp; 1988.2, 263-67. 4 Xunzi attributes this saying to "The Chronicles" or "Annals" (Zhuan flï ), presumably one of the histories compiled by Confucius. Xunzi jijie Hj^Mfft (Xinbian zhuzi jicheng fiHi ItíílOC ed., Taipei: World Press, 1978) 9/97.</page><page sequence="3">ROOTS OF THE HAN RHAPSODY 3 more explicitly advocated taking the people as the root: this was his basis for hoping that rulers would make punishments sparing and taxes low, share the peo- ple's worries and delights, and let the tillers own their land. Xunzi 16 -f, the third major Confucian thinker, similarly advocated frugal rulers who would seek to make the people wealthy. Han writers inherited these theories intact, and used them in narrative fu of persuasion or criticism that chided contemporary government. Kong Zang íL$c (eleventh-generation descendant of Confucius, fl. 171-124 B.C.) targeted brutal wrestling matches between bare-handed commoners and wild tigers (albeit fangless and de-clawed), staged at the nobles' command for their viewing plea- sure: Our present rulers waste themselves in outings and the chase, Leaving none to care for the Nation's affairs. They force men off to wooded hills Or into the Palace to spar with tigers At the cost of agriculture And of rightful life-spans crippled and cut short. Under a regime unjust to man and beast alike, where men were forced to live in forests while animals performed at royal soirees, it should be small wonder that The nation's government is sure to turn chaotic And the people to be scattered about.

But the Han was flourishing, unlike the Qin, because the Han's first emperor had Asked August Heaven for a mandate on the Myriad People's behalf, Whereupon he loosed the bonds that had humbled them, And showered them with what they had lacked. The Emperor Aids the people in Farming and Mulberrying, Dissuades them from indolence, proclaimed Yang, in his "Fu on the Plumed Hunt" ("Yulie fu" ^ffiK), an exhor- tation to let the people prosper.9 Zhang Heng Wfä (78-139), who in his lifetime saw the Later Han begin its slide from power into weakness, aimed a stinging warning at Luoyang's deca- dent aristocrats: Princes now who exhaust the people as the price of royal delight Forget that from those people's hatred will come bitter vengeance! Those fond of squandrous, passionate pursuits May overlook rebellion from below and so engender their own dismay.

The central idea is to facilitate agriculture and make the people rich. Such examples, of which one could list more, should be enough to confirm how deeply Confucian thought permeated the fu, and that it was sincere rather than for show. These fu, intended for rulers' ears, named the people as the em- pire's foundation. The way in which fu writers dealt with that principle should remind us that, in Zhou and Han China, philosophy and poetry were not as generically distinct from each other as they would later become. Although Zhou philosophy and Han/w are separate genres, they are indistinguishable in so many basic areas that it would be instructive to view them as organically connected parts of an almost unbroken writing tradition. The /w's philosophical roots, of course, were not limited to Confucianism. When Han rhapsodists faced personal misfortune, found their aspirations thwart- ed, and poured these troubles into the fu, they tended toward the cluster of ideas that have since become known as "Taoism": broadly defined as the thought of the Laozi and Zhuangzi, plus the lore of alchemy, immortality, and other forms 11 WX 8/168-69; QHW 21.6a-b/243; cf. Knechtges, Wen Xuan, vol. 2, pp. 109-11.</page><page sequence="6">6 ZHANG CANGSHOU AND JONATHAN PEASE of physical transcendence. These ideas involved keeping disaster away, learning to think sensibly and survive. Han fu seldom mentioned the alternative - Qu Yuan's ®g path of death with purity - despite the fact that Qu Yuan's "Li sao" &amp;£ü and its associated pieces seem to have been the/w's most important ancestors Stylistically. It was Laozi and Zhuangzi who appeared more prominent- ly in the/w, often through direct narration in the "shorter fu of personal feelings" (shuqing xiao fu gfiff'hK), as early as 174 B.C. That was the year in which Jia Yi Hit (201-169 B.C.) wrote his "Fw on the Owl" ("Funiao fu" WiñU.).12 Jia Yi had already shown signs of striving to see beyond Qu Yuan's solution, in his "Elegy for Qu Yuan" ("Diao Qu Yuan wen" ^SIii£).13 Now, three years later, he took the voice of an owl, who intoned a dense fugue of Laozi and Zhuangzi phrases quoted almost verbatim. These words from the owl addressed Jia Yi's questions ("Why was I slandered? Why am I exiled?") in the light of metaphysi- cal ideas, such as the interdependence of fortune and misfortune or the incon- stancy of change. The owl praised such figures as the Great Man (dàren ~kh), the Achieved Man (dàren ìi À), True Man (zhenren M A), or Ultimate Man (zhi- ren ÏÀ, "The Man who has Arrived"): all symbols of the paths of "non-action" (wu wei &amp;M) and "retreat from disaster" (bi huo SÈU). Over three centuries later, Zhang Heng, who had held office for over twenty years without achieving anything he felt meaningful, wrote "Returning to the Fields" ("Gui tian fu" U ffl K), a narration of the human search for a home base. Although Zhang invokes the sages that are generally associated with Confucian- ism - Yao ^1, Shun ft9 Confucius himself - his ending is unmistakably Lao- Zhuang: If I did but loose my mind beyond all worldly beings, What would I know about the ways of Glory and Disgrace? Longer personal rhapsodies, as opposed to these short ones, often expanded beyond such non-action themes into the realm of physical transcendence. They evoked fantasy worlds that wafted above grubby reality, symbolizing what the poet hoped could be a freer life. Feng Yan ¡if iff (fl. ca. A.D. 25), who survived Wang Mang's 1:M usurpation only to be demoted and humiliated by the dis- pleased founder of the Later Han, leaned sharply toward the Immortal arts in his "Aspirations Revealed" ("Xian zhi fu" KSK): Virtue and the Path: why treasure them? Status and Self - why hold those dear? I'll build a weir in the canyon, live there idly Preserving my spirit, as I guard this Aloneness. 12 WX 13/276; QHW 15.2a/208; trans. James R.

Another striking similarity between Han fu and the philosophical schools lies in the methods and spirit with which they criticize those "worldly habits" (shi su tSfS) and other realities. Those methods include the following. (1) Incisive, Undisguised Attacks against Contemporary Ills Mencius (3797-281? B.C.) and Han Feizi »#f (ca. 280-233 B.C.) were the strongest muckrakers among the Hundred Schools, as they publicly rebuked so- cial and governmental failings. Mencius criticized King Hui several times for ig- noring human misery: When dogs and pigs eat human food and you do not think to restrict them; when starved corpses lie in the roads but you do not think to open the granaries; and when people die but you say, "It is the harvest's fault, not mine" - how does this differ from stabbing a man to death and saying, "It was the weapon's doing, not mine?" Han Feizi, half a century later, wrote even more scathingly against aristocratic decadence as well as official corruption and stupidity. This legacy of biting criti- cism was not forgotten in the Han; it came back into style during the Later Han's difficult twilight. Writers of the shorter, personal fu attacked current trends with a noble wrath whose dignified words spoke of righteousness betrayed. Especially well remembered were those who invented fresh metaphors, such as Cai Yong Mn (133-192): his "Tale of a Journey" ("Shu xing fu" ìfcirK) mentioned the growing gap between the rich few and the wretched multitudes. In Luoyang, Cai Yong found Those high and favored, fanning their prominence to a searing heat All guard their gains, never giving way. When a carriage overturns not far in front, Chariots rush from behind to pass it by: Pavilions and gazebos run the gamut of chic decor; People dwell in the open air, sleep on soggy ground 17 WX 15/317; QHHW 52.5b-6a/761. 18 Mencius 1A:3.</page><page sequence="9">ROOTS OF THE HAN RHAPSODY 9 While fragrant meal is showered on birds and animals Who leave husks and seeds, but not one grain behind.

By "evil" (xie SB) he meant a broken, demoralized society, decadent aristocrats and nefarious politics, all of which were worsening: This downslide began during Spring and Autumn times; The Warring Kingdoms added their poison While Qin and Han offered nothing to transcend it But' brought their own new rancor and atrocities... . **&amp;&amp;«»«, 7ügflq£äge-.21 The rot was in the government: As we reach our own time, Perfidy and prejudice take ten thousand forms, Fawners and toadiers burn daily brighter While the stern and tough attenuate and perish, Scab-suckers hitch up four-horse teams While those of straight demeanor trudge the roads... . fS£^f tlfftÄÄ. feagBÄ, WS m t.

Such frank attacks on those in power were a direct legacy from the pre-Han phi- losophers. (2) Exaggerated Language and Subtle Barbs The character Yanzi (based on Yan Ying #ü, d. 500 B.C.) advised his ruler using debate techniques and humor, embellished with exaggeration, devil's-advocacy, feints and flank attacks that showered the listener with hailstorms of words. The classic example is his "Advice When Duke Jing's Favorite Horse Died and the Duke Wished to Put the Hostlers to Death."22 Pretending to approve of the death sentence, Yanzi asked the Duke's permission to tell the men their crimes before they went into the dungeon, to give them a proper conviction before their beheading: Your crimes are three! The Duke charged you to nourish the horse but you killed it. That was your first capital crime. It was the Duke's favorite horse - that is your second capital crime. And finally, because you have caused the Duke to have men killed on account of a horse, the common people on hearing the news will resent our Duke, noble lords on hearing it will demean our nation - yes, in killing His Lordship's horse you will cause rancor against him to swell up among the folk, and our nation's army to be weaker than our neighbors'. That is your third crime worthy of death, and that is why you are being sent to prison now! Yanzi laid out the first two "crimes" with a straight face, apparently in agreement with the Duke's wishes. But with his third charge he began to "curse the ash while pointing at the mulberry" {zhi sang ma huai ig HUÍS ): that "third crime" was the one he hoped to prevent - the Duke's crime of murdering his own men, and the public perils to which it would so surely lead, none of which should be blamed on the hostlers that the Duke was so eager to punish. Needless to say, after being stung by this cunning rebuke, the remorseful Duke reversed his judgment - as he usually did when Yanzi advised him.23 22 "Jing gong suo ai ma si, yu zhu yuren, Yanzi jian" jft&amp;fjJrSÄ^E, ëfcjftlHÀ, S "F II- In Yanzi chunqiu jiaozhu U f #fAÌ$£È (Xinbian zhuzi jicheng ed.) 1:25/34. 23 Sima Qian W) JsgìS (b. 145 or 135 B.C.) tells a similar story about the Jester Meng (You Meng (Saí), who persuaded the King of Chu to bury a favorite horse not just with the trappings of a Lord High Minister, but with the ceremony due to a prince. (Pretending to agree.) Or better yet, to "embalm" the horse with herbs and spices, and "bury" it in men's bellies. (Flank attack. The horse had been so pampered that it died of obesity, and would be considered good eating, even in that effete court.) This story may well be a burlesque of the more pas- sionate but less humorous Yanzi tale. See Shi ji Í. IB (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1975) 126/3200.</page><page sequence="11">ROOTS OF THE HAN RHAPSODY 11 Han narrative fu use persuasion techniques that follow Yanzi's outlines: they might first praise the ruler to the skies, playing to his presumed psychologi- cal need to attach grand successes to his name; but then a sudden, crucial twist of the brush brings in another voice who attacks this verbal edifice from the flank. In such a sequence, Sima Xiangru's "Sir Vacuous" (Zi Xu f Ä), the envoy from Chu, boasts to Qi of the vast splendor of Chu's Yunmeng Park and the Chu monarch's hunting expeditions - grander than any hunts in history - only to be deftly rebuffed by Master Improbable (Wuyou xiansheng ,Üíí5fc£) of Qi, who tells him: "You wallow in talk of indulgent pleasures, revealing their wanton excess!" ffgf, ffn^^».24 Likewise, the bulk of Yang Xiong's "Fu on the Plumed Hunt" is given over to describing, almost surreally, the huge scale of the Emperor Cheng's hunting parties, in what sounds like a paean to these affairs and the grand regime that sponsors them. But when we contrast this florid swath of verse with the equally forceful final passage in which Yang exhorts against such spectacles, it becomes clear that he had been praising them only to make all the more transparent what mistakes they were and how wrong the Emperor was to indulge in them. In a way, this is the same kind of backhanded praise that Yanzi had prac- ticed on his Duke. But there is a difference: Yanzi and the philosophers had usu- ally focussed their advice strictly on the subject at hand; in Yang Xiong's words, this would be "to admonish and have done with it" (feng ze yi 38PJJB).25 But Han rhapsodists roamed through broad vistas, lavishing riotous images upon their listeners, to the point that Yang Xiong finally accused those writers (includ- ing himself, it is thought) of "promoting a hundred evils for each one they dis- courage" (quan bai er feng yi ÎÈSnïïR^).26 It might seem that Han/w had de- scended into pointless rhetoric designed to praise and entertain rather than teach. In some ways this may have been true. But there were reasons for such lavishness: Han emperors were mightier beings than the Spring and Autumn Dukes had been. Han sovereigns had more power, greater ambitions, and an accompanying mind-set that reacted to rhetoric in ways quite different from their forebears. Spring and Autumn rulers had to struggle just to keep their territories safe, to say nothing of gaining advantages; government for them demanded extraordinary care. But early Han emperors, seated at the pinnacle of a unified world, could afford to think big and thirst for a shining name. 24 "Fu on Sir Vacuous" ("Zi Xu fu" f EHÄ ), ^A^ 7/158; QHW 2Ì.2W2AÌ; cf. trans, in Knecht- ges, Wen Xuan, vol. 2, p. 69. 25 Yangzi fa y an J§ f ¡£ =f (Xinbian zhuzi jicheng ed.) 2/4. 26 In many of these fu it is true that the multitude of passages that "promote" compared with the paltry number that "discourage" suggests an atmosphere of six months of Mardi Gras followed by a weekend of Lent; or (as Yang Xiong went on to say) following a full program of decadent Zheng-and-Wei music with a brief encore from the Elegantiae%l&amp;%'$'^_% , ffiH-nÏÏuïï- Yang Xiong's comments are quoted in Ban Gu's evaluation of Sima Xiangru: Han shu ÜÄ (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1975) 57B/2609.</page><page sequence="12">12 ZHANG CANGSHOU AND JONATHAN PEASE (3) Unabashed Joking that Hides a Solemn Message Zhuangzi's early-Han followers said that Zhuangzi had Found this mundane realm too sunken and sullied, Not to be conversed with in serious speech. The only way he could deal with such a world was by using Absurd, far-fetched theories, meaningless talk, Phrases with no ends or edges... . The Inner or "authentic" chapters of Zhuangzi are indeed written in just such a tone. It seems that Zhuang Zhou ffiJS (ca. 369 -ca. 286 B.C.), finding solemn prose rather pointless in his unruly era, filled his works with fantasies and outra- geous parables that ridiculed contemporary mores and behavior. His story of the fish caught in the rain-puddle satirized that stingy insincerity that all too often markets itself as generosity and vision. (The fish asks the passerby for just a bit of water right now, to keep him from drying to death; but the passerby proposes having a canal dug that can bring torrents - once it is finished in a few years' time.)29 Zhuangzi's questioning of Cao Shang is a merciless attack on fame- seekers and money-mongers. (Cao Shang Wffi brags about the hundred chariots that the King of Qin gave him; Zhuangzi reminds him that the doctors who lance the king's sores are paid one chariot, while those who suck his hemorrhoids get five: the viler the service, the higher the pay. What service did Cao Shang per- form to deserve a hundred chariots?)30 And there is his conversation with the skull, a meditation not so much about living and dying as it is about how be- nighted society has become: the skull would rather stay dead and free than be restored to a life through which he must toil hemmed in by kings above and vassals below.31 This approach - finding parable material in one's own experience, then stylizing and hyperbolizing it - attracted the Han fu writers. Yang Xiong's "Fu on Expelling Poverty" ("Zhu pin fu" SÄBK - the title itself is an allegory) follows Zhuangzi's example of spinning a story that takes himself as raw mate- rial. Here, Yang Xiong and Poverty have a debate. Yang Xiong lists the actual 27 From the "Under Heaven" ("Tian xia" ^~f ) chapter. Zhuangzi yinde ffi-f3li# (Harvard- Yenching Index Series) 33/64, 65.

Transmission and Development of Literary Creation Theories Based on materials that have survived, we would be wise to assume that before the late Han there was not a strong concept of "literature" as separate from phi- losophy, statecraft or scholarly learning, and that therefore there was no ancient "literary theory" as we know it or even as the ancient Greeks knew it.34 But there might still have been theories about the writer's craft, if not about literature as a whole. If such theories did appear in the prose of the Hundred Schools, however, they have since been scattered. We can trace only a few ideas about indi- vidual aspects of rhetoric or composition, such as how to frame an argument, put metaphors to use, or coordinate a train of thought. Meager as the material is, one can still sense that philosophers approached these issues in ways that even- tually had an enormous impact on the evolution of the fu. The philosophers' basic premise about literary creation - at least in the case of their own writing - seems to have been that one should write for a pur- pose, from a standpoint of responsible involvement with the world. To achieve this purpose it was important to clarify the Tao. "Take strange doctrines to task," Confucius advised, "For they do much harm" (Gong hu yiduan, si hai ye yi A¥^rä,#iiStilß ).35 In other words, writing that addressed the problems brought on by "strange doctrines" and depraved ideas could help dispel many evils that afflicted the state. Poetry had its uses too. Through the Odes, Confucius said, we could awake (xing m ), learn to observe (guan H ), learn to join the multitude (gun M ), ex- press resentment (yuan £g ), serve fathers and rulers, and call plants and animals by their right names.36 Mozi If (ca. 468-376 B.C.), like Confucius, also con- sidered literature as something practical and constructive: The purpose of Rhetoric is to clarify the distinction between true and false, examine the fabric of order and disorder; clarify where things are the same and where they differ, investigate the principles of name and substance; maneuver among benefit 34 See Donald Holzman, "Confucius and Ancient Chinese Literary Criticism," in Adele Austin Rickett, ed., Chinese Approaches to Literature from Confucius to Liang Ch'i-ch'ao (Princeton U.P., 1978), pp. 21-23. 35 Lunyu ¿fògg 2:16. The old question of whether gong ¿£ means "attack, take to task" or "apply oneself to study" may be unresolvable, although "attack" appears more likely. In either case, the line as a whole makes it plain that Confucius did not approve of yiduan ^¿S. 17- duarfs exact meaning is also open to question: although we could translate it as "heterodoxy," it would have been an anachronistic meaning for Confucius, in whose time there was not yet a philosophical "orthodoxy" as we know it, certainly not a Confucian orthodoxy. Literally, yiduan means "other teachings" and is well rendered by Legge's "strange doctrines," which we borrow here. 36 See Lunyu 17:9.

Granted, Xunzi states these things in a chapter devoted to "Setting Names to Rights" ("Zheng ming" iE^S); this indicates that he may have linked writing, rhetoric and the Tao only in this context, not in gen- eral. Still it is instructive to know that he did link them. Speech, said the Zhuangzi school, was meant to "Force the Hundred Schools' wisdom into a corner, and leave the throng of debating mouths at a loss" (kun baijia zhi zhi, qiong zhongkou zhi bian BSt¿íD, H^ n¿j#).39 In an age marked by continuous crises as well as new hopes, when thinkers and strategists of all persuasions were striving to be heard, it was no accident that those thinkers who turned to writing went straight to their purpose rather than spending time theorizing on the art of writing, and that when they did mention the art of writ- ing they said that writing was a form of rhetoric or debate, meant to elucidate truth. Since pre-Qin China had such a need for rhetoric and practical philosophy, it should not surprise us that it was the philosophical writings that survived better than other pre-Qin texts. It should also not be surprising that those philosophical works gave Han writers their first assumptions about literature's purpose. One of these assumptions was that the fu was an instrument of statecraft. Most peo- ple who wrote fu seem to have agreed with this, especially in the early Han. The fu of Mei Cheng tfcil (d. 140 B.C.) and Sima Xiangru are especially strong exam- ples of verse that was used as advice from minister to ruler. Still, Mei Cheng and Sima Xiangru seem never to have mentioned any theory that encompasses this view of what the fu is for. Why not? Perhaps because the assumption that the fu should serve as persuasive rhetoric was so ingrained that it needed no spe- cial mention. The earliest surviving statement on the /w's purpose comes from Sima Qian, a generation later, describing Sima Xiangru's "Rhapsody of Sir Vacu- ous": His ending brings it back to the question of moderation and restraint, with which he makes an indirect persuasion. £^#§§£^inifê:, BfcJlRil!.40 37 Mozi yinde Skf'ÍYñ (Harvard-Yenching Index Series) 45/1. 38 Xunzi jijie 22/281. 39 Zhuangzi yinde 17/67.

Yang Xiong's prefaces to some of his/w state outright that his motives for writing a piece were "to persuade" or "to encour- age." In his Model Sayings {Fa y an ft If) we read: Someone asked, "Can the fu be used to dissuade (feng Ü)?" He answered, "To dissuade? If it would but stop at that! If it does not stop at dissuasion, I fear it cannot avoid being used to encourage (quart ft)!"41 For Yang, the fu indeed meant persuasion, dissuasion and advice. In his later career, when he rejected the fu out of disillusionment, the reason seems to have been that he saw the fu "encouraging" reprehensible behavior more effectively than it could dissuade against it. The point for us is that, according to evidence available, Han fu writers wrote fu as advice for their rulers and tools for state- craft in exactly the same way that the pre-Han and early-Han philosophers had written their essays. It is indeed a real question whether fu writers and philoso- phers even thought of themselves as writing separate genres. Fu were a form of rhetoric; Han rulers liked to be addressed through fu; Han literati found the fu effective when they wished to participate in politics by advising rulers, displaying aspirations, or defending ideas. Theories of writing that accompanied the fu had begun with the pre-Han philosophers but did not stop with them. Fu writers began with the concept of the fu as political advice, but augmented that concept by seeing the fu also as a way to praise virtue, or as a forum for personal feelings. Ban Gu, in the Later Han, mentioned all three uses of the fu, in the preface to his "Fu on Two Capi- tals" ("Liang du fu" ffifßHÄ). (This preface opens the Wen Xuan, and therefore is almost a second introduction to that collection.) Instead of seeing the fu as prose, Ban Gu dubs it "part of the stream of the ancient Odes."42 When great ministers presented fu to their rulers, Some, by uncovering their inner feelings, used them to convey persuasion and parable; Others, proclaiming the Ruler's virtue, brought loyalty and filiality to the full. Fu as an expression of the writer's feelings and aspirations became a widespread Han concept. Kong Zang wrote about "Willows" ("Yangliu fu" WìBU.) "in order to narrate these feelings" (yi xu si ging tiiitf); Zhang Heng's "Pondering the 41 Yangzi fa y an 2/4.

Feng Yan "wrote a/w to encourage myself, and called it 'Aspirations Revealed'" (zuo fu zi li, ming qi pian y uè "Xian WiWeS, opÄjSHMS).44 Although pre-Han prose had also expressed writers' personal feelings at times, the conscious idea that this could be the main purpose of a piece of written rhetoric was apparently a new concept that began with the Han fu, and departed from the literary consciousness of earlier prose writers.45 While the early writers may not have explained broad literary themes, they did mention techniques. The art of metaphor or analogy in particular - used successfully both in pre-Han philosophical prose and in Han fu - was often enhanced by a systematic theoretical awareness of what the various metaphorical devices should be called, as well as how and why to use them. Mozi defined them first: "To 'make an analogy' means to explain something by taking something else as an example" (pi ye zhe, ju ta wu er yi ming zhi ye titilé, ÇfÊ^ïïïîiU ^¿til)-46 This is the basic definition of a metaphorical device: explaining a in terms of b. Confucius saw this as more than a verbal technique: someone who "can draw analogies from what is close at hand" (neng jin qu pi ëzîèMIS, i.e., include himself in his theories of how other people should behave) has learned how to be sensitive or humane (ren t).47 The Warring-Kingdoms logician Gongsun Longzi &amp;$fcH f took the art of analogy even more seriously. Since it was one of his basic tools, he defined its role with utmost rigor. When he argued that a white horse was not a horse, he was "borrowing an object to make an analogy" (jia wu qu pi WtfydMmt): this was not a frivolous debate but a stern, even passionate attempt to combat the 44 Kong Zang: QHW 13.4b/194. Zhang Heng: QHHW 52.1b/759. This phrase comes from the short introduction to the piece, which might be Fan Ye's Six-dynasties interpolation: see Fan Ye wM (398-445), Hou Han shu ft il* (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1973) 59/1914. Feng Yan: QHHW 20.2a/578. 45 As far back as the Shang shu fö|f [Classic of Documents or History Classic], we see poetry - perhaps the Shijing specifically - being labelled as something that "speaks of aspirations" {shiyan zhi ffS/t)- But it does not say whose aspirations, and apparently the idea applied only to poems and songs, perhaps those used in the highly public environment of diplomatic meetings or court debate. The Han innovation seems to be a heightened sense that the /w, or even out-and-out prose (there was little metrical difference between prose and verse), could be intended as a vehicle for highly personal feelings. Qu Yuan, of course, had already written a prototype of the personal-aspiration fu long before the Han, but it was Han writers who began to label this as a theory. And Qu Yuan's "Li sao," personal and emotional as it is, was still at heart a fu of advice addressed to a ruler. For "poetry speaking of aspirations," see Gu Jiegang uêlfôlj, ed., Shangshu tongjian fàHMfê (1936; repr.

When Kong Zang saw wriggling weevils start to eat the smartweed in his garden, he wrote, "Thereupon I awoke to what these creatures were doing, and applied their situation to that of human beings" ^ê^^íEí^fíftiíÀ.50 Kong was treating metaphor as a way to show us more clearly to ourselves. Much later, Zhao Yi, like many writers at the ends of dynasties, found metaphor the only tool available to say his message safely: Afraid of being banned, I dared not speak in phrases plain and ordered; instead I humbly composed this "Rhapsody of the Cornered Bird... ." Cai Yong apparently tried to write a fu made up largely of similes, as he com- pared "Short People" (dwarves and midgets) to birds, ponies, larvae, etc., with a refrain every four lines: "Look at the short people! This is how they are!" (guan duan ren xi, xing ruo si ffigíÀih JfêïrAfT ). Cai's intention was "to bring in anal- ogies, compare with counterparts, and emerge with all their likenesses" (yin pi bi ou, jie de xingxiang SISifcffi, febí#^ft ).52 Ma Rong Ift (79-166), in his "Fu on the Long Flute" ("Changdi fu" AfëiO, uses similes, analogies, and other techniques to convey how the flute sounds and what it means. Having "heard its sounds," he "arranges them by shapes" (ting sheng lei xing M%ffîJ&amp;): the notes are shaped like (zhuang si ÏÏkOA) flowing streams or flying geese, clustered bees or clonish ants.53 He also "ranks and lists the meanings" of the flute's tones, to "draw parallels to their physical likeness" (lun ji qi yi, xie bi qi xiang ängBÄH, föitÄffc). Thus the mu- sic's unbounded wandering resembles Laozi's and Zhuangzi's capacious calm; its vigor resembles the resoluteness of the worthies Bian Sui ~V$Ê and Mao Guang mt, etc.54 Ma compares sounds to events, to shapes, and to other sounds; com- pares the shapes of sounds to feelings and qualities; evokes the flute's tones 48 Gongsun longzi (Xinbian zhuzi jicheng ed.) 1/1. 49 Han Feizi suoyin Í$#f3t$| (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1982) 3-1-10. 50 "Fu on the Smartweed Weevils" ("Liaochong fu" UMÂ - incomplete).

Pre- Han philosophers had not used analogy and metaphor for that kind of pure de- scription; in this area the later-Han fu was evolving beyond them. The writers of both the Zhuangzi and the Han fu clearly understood that literature must grow out of broad, untrammeled trains of thought as well as a rich imagination. This is what Sima Xiangru (or a later-Han writer claiming to quote him) meant by saying, "A fu writer's mind encompasses the universe, as he pulls all men and creatures into his gaze" (fujia zhi xin baokuo yuzhou, zong- lan renwu ©^¿.'kSíSíffi, ffiAÀÍ^ ).55 Whether or not these are Sima Xiang- ru's words, the kind of fu they describe is the kind that he made famous.56 One cannot write a piece on the order of the "Imperial Park" or "Great Man" without first freeing the imagination, extending one's thoughts to cast nets for all phe- nomena - past and future, celestial and mundane. One must indeed "rein in Heaven and Earth, intermesh ancient and new" {kongyin tiandi, cuozong gujin S^l^ife, £hA~È*^), as the same passage suggests.

Prof. Zhou Xunchu W'W]W nas examined the passage attrib- uted to Sima Xiangru, and found that some of its vocabulary follows Jin trends rather than Han custom: most notably in the word "universe" (yuzhou ^lÈ), the Xijing zaji passage treats yu as space and zhou as time, while the actual Sima Xiangru followed normal Han usage by using yuzhou to refer only to space (in the "Shanglin fu"). Also, the Xijing zaji passage has a metaphysical thrust that dovetails with Jin-dynasty writings about literature, such as the "Wen fu" ÏBK of Lu Ji |^ü (262-303), but not with known Han writings on literature. See Zhou Xunchu, "Sima Xiangru fu lun zhiyi" ^]^^ßU'M,tm'8.^. [Querying Sima Xiangru's Theory of the Fu], in Wenshizhe £ £ g 200 (1990.5), 20-24. Despite Prof. Zhou's compelling argument, it still seems worthwhile to mention this Xijing zaji passage be- cause of its fame; because it does convincingly describe the world evoked in Sima Xiangru's rhapsodies; because its aesthetics apply well to Later Han fu as well as to Sima Xiangru's fu; and because it seems logical that Han writers would have evaluated their own work from a grandiose point of view such as this, occasionally at least, even it it were only later writers who verbalized that viewpoint into a theory. 57 Zhuangzi yinde 33/63; cf. translation in Graham, Chuang-tzuy p. 282. 58 Zhuangzi yinde 33/65-66; cf.

The goal of Zhuangzi's True Man, who had mastered these arts, was To roam above with the Maker of Beings, And below to make friends with those who have put themselves outside both death and life and have no end or beginning. Dissimilar as they may be otherwise, Zhuangzi's True Man and Sima Xiangru's Great Man share a philosophical underpinning: transcendence over time and space. Just as important is their authors' common approach to writing. Thoughts that range through the universe, fired by imaginary phantasms, are bound to pro- duce grand hyperbole and prolix rhetoric, whether the author is Zhuangzi, Sima Xiangru, or one of their followers: the "mind of the fu writer" and that of the Taoist philosopher thus make contact at several points. By the mid-Han, Feng Yan was intoning such ideas in his fu, as we saw: "I'll let my Essence roam the Cosmos, ripple my vision round the Eightfold Bounds, as I observe on all Nine Continents the body of each peak and stream... ."61 Fu of disappointed aspira- tion such as Feng Yan's, by their very nature, had a forebear in Zhuangzi's thought. Zhuangzi showed the rhapsodists how to whip up a liberating, inventive fantasy world from total nothingness, and use it to proclaim new aspirations that transcended their wearying lives. Artistic Heritage and Innovations We have mentioned metaphor and fantastic description as aspects of writing that the Han fu shared with pre-Han philosophers. They also had specific technical points in common.

Liezi's "Foolish Old Man" (Yugong &amp;&amp;) and "Wise Elder" (Zhisou §30 symbolize the writer's rejection of "wisdom": the stupid, ignorant Old Man has a dedication that can move a mountain range and inspire the Lord of Heaven to support him; while the intelligent, learned Elder finds himself 59 Ibid. 60 Zhuangzi yinde 33/67-68; cf.

The officer who did locate the pearl was named Amorphus Noncorporealibus (Xiangwang |£H).63 Zhuangzi lets the symbolism of the names float right on the surface, without even a trace of subtlety: "Sagacitus" represents wisdom; "Disputator Cacopho- nius" stands for debate, argument and rhetoric, while Amorphus Noncorporeali- bus is the state of "No Mind" (wu xin faM), and the Dark Pearl is the Tao. The story implies that we can retrieve the Tao only if we cast aside our minds and cease to depend on wisdom. Zhuangzi often substitutes a string of anecdotes for the straight essay form. Within many of those anecdotes he uses a further kind of indirection by having his characters speak for him. Often the characters are archetypes and speak in proverbs: spokesmen in his first chapter include the legendary hermits Xu You aï È and Lianshu 31 $L64 Han narrative fu shared this technique, as seen in Sima Xiangru's three spokesmen Sir Vacuous (Zi Xu), Master Improbable (Wu- you xiansheng) and Lord No-such (Wushi gong tfS).65 Zhang Heng's "Fw on the Two Metropolises" ("Er jing fu" hmÍÇ) gave us Prince Groundless (Ping- xu gongzi ìnAùkf) and Master Where Is He (Anchu xiansheng ^i&amp;Jcí).66 These latter allegorical names had a somewhat different purpose than those in the Zhuangzi and other philosophers: Zhuangzi had used his nonexistent charac- ters to encode his philosophy, while Han fu, more often than not, used them to assure listeners that the words they were hearing were empty and "groundless." Truth could hide safely within this bed of self-proclaimed nonsense; hints of sedi- tion or disrespect could be ignored. The tradition survived to inspire Cao Xue- qin's creation of Mr. Facts In Hiding (Zhen Shiyin iSzbffi, i.e., zhenshi yinqu AíffiS) and Dr. Lies N.

Mei Cheng used a Visitor From Wu (Wu ke j^$) to attack corrupt aristocratic ways of life.68 Instead of presenting proposals to the Em- peror directly, Sima Xiangru had Lord No-such tell an envoy from Qi the story of the Imperial Park, including the Emperor's reckless enjoyment of it and subse- quent conversion to a life of statesmanship. Yang Xiong's character "Sir Ink, the Guest" (Zi Mo keqing f H$iP), not Yang, is the one who blames the imperial addiction to hunting expeditions for squandering resources and disturbing the farmers.69 Ban Gu's "Host in the [current] Eastern Capital" (Dong du zhuren ì£ÌS±À) criticizes the "Visitor from the [former] Western Capital" (Xi du bin SIGA), in terms that sum up how Ban Gu himself disapproved of Chang'an's ostentation and waste.70 When we seek to understand why Han writers borrowed these fanciful per- sonae to convey their thoughts, the simplest rationale is that by using personae, the writers could thoroughly criticize while remaining personally safe. This may also have been one of Zhuangzi's rationales for clothing his train of reason in fables and analogies. But the Han fu stretched the scale of these invented charac- ters' performances beyond mere advice to a ruler or answers to tough questions, adding layers and dimensions that make the "Seven Stimuli," "Sir Vacuous," the "Imperial Park," Ban's "Two Capitals" and Zhang's "Two Metropolises" the sprawling masterpieces that they are. (2) Common Stylistic Traditions: Bold Imaginary Landscapes and Sharply Etched Personalities Zhuangzi's hyperfantasized world of Spirit Men, True Men and Ultimate Men leaves his first-time readers flabbergasted. These characters show what it means to have attained the Tao: time and space do not block them as they ramble through infinite realms. With the Ultimate Man (zhiren 3?À), Great fens on fire cannot heat him, The freezing of Rivers Huang and Han cannot cool him; Sudden mountain-cracking thunder and sea-rocking tempests cannot flinch him: One such as this rides cloud-aethers, mounts the Sun and Moon sophistication, is paper-thin to any but the most obtuse reader. In other words, the surface silliness is there more to convey a sense of panache than to really defuse the work's dangers.

His first chapter's breathlessly-sketched beasts and birds, ranging from microscopic to galactic, are even better known. There is no question that Sima Xiangru wrote his "Great Man Rhapsody" under the influence of these and other early Zhuangzi passages. Sima' s Great Man (dàren ~k À ), like Zhuangzi's Ulti- mate Man or True Man, soars above the throng, roams past the world, rides cloudy aethers into the Thunder Chamber and out through Ghoul Canyon; surveys the Eight Points and gazes over Four Seas. "When you read Sima Xiang- ru's 'Great Man'," writes Wen Yiduo, "you have to realize that this is a 'great' of incalculable size, a Zhuangzi size, the size of imaginary space."72 Such Zhuangzi-space also found its way into the fu of personal emotions. The Han-dynasty portions of the Chu ci contain fantasy journeys whose inspira- tion comes more from Zhuangzi than from Qu Yuan, their ostensible progenitor. A glance at the glittering, triumphant "Far Roaming" ("Yuan you" ät jS , Juan 5 of the Chu ci), compared with the earth-haunted, garlanded, trance-like jour- ney of Qu Yuan's "Li sao" (Chu ci 1), shows this immediately. The fragmentary, anonymous Han piece "Alas for that Vow!" ("Xi shi" fgfS, Chu ci 11), draws from Zhuangzi as well as from the "Far Roaming." Some say that the piece's frustrated minister was Jia Yi, who first showed the world how to vent public indignation through private grief. He writes, I climb the Azure Heaven, thrusting high, Cross mountain masses, farther with each day In cool clarity I find my own delight, Absorb the myriad aethers, sail and soar... .

Another fu shows Yang Xiong exploring his Great Darkness: Ten thousand leagues in a flash, then I stop; I visit the Ranked Immortals as a guest for the night. The Han-rhapsody world of fantasy flying was not Qu Yuan's fleeting, glorious but soon-burst vision, but Zhuangzi's realm of footloose spirits and Ultimate Beings. Another stylistic trait that Han rhapsodists learned from the philosophers was that of bold personification. Striking examples describe the effect of music. "In ancient times," wrote Xunzi, surely quoting an old saying, "stream-running fish came out to listen when Hu Ba strummed the cithern; Six Royal Horses looked up from their feed when Bo Ya played his lute" ^SHE&amp;SfflflÊ&amp;ttí Si, {âï^^M^AfPft.76 Such overdrawn anthropomorphic images are com- mon enough in folk proverbs, and it is no surprise to see them in a book that promotes pithy wisdom. But by the time of the LiezU these images were growing more elaborate. In Liezi's words, when Hu Ba played, "Birds danced and fishes leaped" (niao wu yu yue JSjH&amp;SI). When Qin Qing "sang a mournful tune, beating out the rhythm, his voice shook the forest trees, and its echoes halted the clouds in their journey" **-«li5ffi»f #«#*, »«fî«.77 When the Beauty of Han (Han E $|fô ), forced to sing on the street for a living, finished her song and went away, her "lingering echoes swirled about the rafter beams for three days without ceasing.

When she sang of how she had been mistreat- ed, everyone who heard her wept so hard that they could not eat for three days until she sang again to cheer them; whereupon the whole village leaped and danced for joy.78 74 "Lamenting my Fate in These Times" ("Ai shi ming" ^H# #).

Cai Yong wrote how a zither could make "lumbering beasts burst out dancing, flying birds wheel down" ^tt$ft, fféATffl.80 Sima Xiangru, champion of tight hyperbole, described music on the Imperial lake: They pound upon brass drums, blow the wailing pipes, Boatmen sing, their threnody flowing - Water reptiles thrash surprised, great geese churn the waves to froth, Geysers erupt, colliding in their spouting panic... . 1«£K, pfc»l«l, fëÀ», &gt;ïfMm. *ftß, fi»», SURE, »JSt-?1 In all these passages, human and animal reactions personify the way in which good music moves the mind. This type of writing all began when Xunzi and the philosophers illustrated their ideas with proverbs. (3) Common Organizational Approaches: Parallel Presentations, Cataloguing, Topically Ordered Descriptions Narrations and descriptions in Han/w are famous for their ranking in categories, each of which is taken to its limits before the next comes into view. This closely resembles the oratory of the Roving Persuaders (also known as Masters of Vertical and Horizontal Alliances or zonghengjia fl*IKâ?, counted among the Hundred Schools), as formalized in such works as the Intrigues of the Warring States (Zhan'guo ce RUSSE). The resemblance between the Intrigues and the fu has a simple explanation: Warring Kingdoms "persuaders" and Han fu poets served much the same function. They were all rhetoricians addressing rulers. But their roles were not identical: old-time Persuaders such as Su Qin S^ and Zhang Yi 3Sfil (d. 310 B.C.) had been orators exclusively, who powered their speech with 79 "Seven Stimuli," WX 34/749; QHW 20.5a/238. 80 "Fu on the Zither" ("Qin fu" ^BÄ), QHHW 69.5b/854. 81 "Sir Vacuous," ("Zi Xu fu"), WX 7/157; QHW 21.2b/241; cf.

Their listeners were dukes and kings who were always hungry for any advice on the wisdom of "Vertical and Horizontal Alliances." But by the Han, these orations had been transformed into polished prose, to be studied in histories or rhetoric manuals; Mei Cheng, Sima Xiangru, Yang Xiong and the others were not speakers but writers, whose job was to amuse princes and emperors who were comfortably ensconced upon their thrones. Nevertheless, Su Qin's and Zhang Yi's speeches, at least as preserved in the Intrigues of the Warring States (their books Suzi and Zhangzi are lost), inevitably have much in common with the/w: catalogues of ideas or images in orderly ranks of four-character lines; lavish rhymes; bright, quick rhythms; thorough descriptions, multi-faceted narration; amplification and exaggeration, richly highlighted and deeply layered; ornate phrases graced with magnificent sounds and rare, elegant words; parallel sentences, logical construc- tions. In Sum Of the philosophers and thinkers that preceded the Han, those who show the clearest traces in Han rhapsodies seem to have been the Confucians, the Taoists, and to a lesser extent the Persuaders or zonghengjia. The Confucian strain shows through in fu passages that have to do with ordering politics and managing the state; Taoism surfaces when writers speak of hiding from the world and keeping disaster at a distance. As for literary technique, the fu found inspiration across the whole range of earlier and contemporary writing, not just in the poetic tradi- tion. It is even possible to argue that the fu, as a whole, grew more directly and deeply from philosophical writings than from the Shi jing or Chu ci. The Shi jing is supposed to have given the fu its principles of "metaphor" (bi it) and "inspiration" (or "association," xing S ), while the Chu ci taught fu writers how to lay out panoplies of words. These characteristics of the Shi jing and Chu ci have a long pedigree, as does the tradition that they were the /w's true ancestors. Both Shi and Chu ci pieces were declaimed at court functions, thus anticipating an important use of the fu. But if we look at what is actually in the Shi jing and Chu ci - including the time-hallowed bi and xing - almost all of those features that found their way into the fu appear also in the philosophical writ- ings, just as prominently as in the Shi jing and Chu ci, if not more so. And the few literary techniques of the Han fu that were consciously mentioned as techniques are mentioned only in the philosophical writings, not in the Chu ci or Shi jing at all. According to this reasoning, then, when Ban Gu said that "fu belongs to the stream of the ancient Odes" (fuzhe gu shi zhi liu ye K^^lt^ÖiEiil), he was overstating the case in order to emphasize a spiritual affinity - in essence, he was creating an ancestry for the/w. We should strive to understand his reasons for perceiving such an ancestry; his perception becomes especially important when we trace the fu of his own era and later. Likewise we should pay attention</page><page sequence="27">ROOTS OF THE HAN RHAPSODY 27 when Liu Xizai says that "The 'Li sao' is the ancestor of the/«": he is stating an obvious truth, borne out by the "Li sao's" metrics, length, origins, purposes and stature in the Han tradition.82 But the more one looks at the actual con- tents of Han fu and of all the literature that came before, the less possible it is to follow the simple old explanations that the fu came from southern Sao poetry and northern shi poetry. The fact is, the fu as a total entity - a fusion of metrics, rhetoric, moral stance, tone and purpose - began to a great extent as an integral part of the prose tradition. In particular, it springs from the same well as those works that were devoted to explaining ideas and promoting wisdom. 82 Ban Gu, Liu Xizai: see notes 1 and 2 above. Knechtges proposes that Ban Gu may have had a technical precedent in mind: fu was one of six traditional "song techniques" (Hit shi A If or liu yi Aft).
