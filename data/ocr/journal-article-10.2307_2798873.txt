<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES TO CONTRIBUTORS Manuscripts of articles should normally be not less than I,500 and not more than IO,OOO words long. They should be typed double-spaced on quarto paper (i.e. approximately IO in. x 8 in. or 26 cm. x 2i cm.) with a 2-inch margin at the left-hand side and a 3-inch space above the titles of both articles and reviews. The top copy should be submitted and a carbon copy retained by the author. The author should underline nothing except words which are to be italicised. An over-corrected manuscript may be returned to the author for re-submission. Notes and references should be typed double-spaced on separate pages and will be included at the end of the article. The text should refer to notes numbered consecutively through the article; bibliographical references should be cited in the text by the author's last name, date of publication and page, e.g. (Firth I954: 285) or, if the author's name is mentioned in the text, by the date and page reference only, e.g. (I954: 286). Entries in the references should be in alphabetical order of authors and should include: name and initials of author(s), date, title, name of a periodical, volume number (arabic numerals to be used throughout), pagination (for articles in periodicals), place of publication (and name of publisher for any book published in I9OI or after). Titles of periodicals should be abbreviated according to the World list of scienttfic periodicals; when in doubt, the entire title should be listed. Examples of the style to be used are: Beattie, J. H. M. I964. Other cultures. London: Cohen &amp; West. Mair, L. I96I. Clientship in East Africa. Cah. 1tudes afr. 2, 3I5 -25. Firth, R. I960. Recent trends in British social anthropology. In Men and cultures (ed.) A. F. C. Wallace. Philadelphia: Pennsylvania Univ. Press. Sutton, George M. I932. The exploration of Southampton Island, Hudson Bay (Mem. Carneg. Mus. I2: i). Pittsburgh: Carnegie Museum. Non-European languages should be written in roman rather than phonetic letters. Tables should be submitted on separate pages, numbered and with headings. Maps and text figures should be drawn in black waterproof ink about twice the intended final size, with lettering in soft pencil. Notations in the text should indicate where these are to appear. Plates should be not less than intended final size and be printed on glossy paper. They should be titled and numbered. Book reviews should contain no footnotes; references to other works should be incorporated in the text; page references should be given when quotations from the book are included. Galley proofs of articles will be sent to authors, who should use the standard method of proof correction. Corrected proofs should be returned before the date indicated: where proofs are not received in time, the Editor will send to the printers his own corrected proof. Proofs are intended for checking, not re-writing, and authors are most strongly reminded that material should be submitted which is ready for the printer. Proofs of correspondence, announcements and reviews will not normally be sent to authors. The Editor reserves the right to shorten corres- pondence where necessary. Authors receive 25 free copies of offprints of articles only. Additional copies can be supplied at cost price, and must be ordered and paidfor when the corrected proofs are returned. Contributions, book reviews and other correspondence should be addressed to the Honorary Editor, Royal Anthropological Institute, 2I Bedford Square, London, W.C.i, England. 7-M.</page><page sequence="2">THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY Research Scholarships in Anthropology and Sociology Applications are invited for research scholarships in social anthropology and sociology, linguistics and prehistoric archaeology, all with special reference to Australia, the Pacific and Southern Asia.
