<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gregorianum 92, 1 (2011) 159-182 Tripersonalising the Hindu God of Advaità Vedànta - Parabrahman The Parabrahman of Advaita Vedànta (henceforth Advaita), presumes a divine reality that is one-only-without-a-second (ekam èva advitiyam: Chàndogaya Upanisad 6.2.1,2), thereby non-Trinitarian. Articulating the Parabrahman through a Trinitarian hermeneutic involves a task of veritable expertise in both Advaita and Christian Trinitarian theology. Within an interreligious dialogical context it entails a symbiotic exchange between Hinduism (Advaita) and Christianity that helps eventually to transform the former's concept of God and tripersonalising it, which is indeed the fundamental thesis of this article. Brahmabàndhab Upàdhyày:3 1861-1907 (henceforth Upàdhyày), the found ing father of Indian Christian theology, in his efforts to approach the Christian doctrine through the Hindu paradigm, subsequently offered a Trinitarian per spective to the God conception of Advaita based on his Thomistic reading of the Saccidànanda,4 envisioning thereby the Parabrahman as personal/tripersonai. The present article has three sections. The first, deals with the understand ing of the Parabrahman according to Sankara5 and the personal/tripersonal 1 Among the six main schools of Hindu philosophy namely: Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimartisa and Vedànta, the Vedànta philosophy, by far, holds a prestigious position. Vedànta, literally means the end (anta) of the Vedas. Among the various schools of Vedànta philosophy, to name a few: Kevala Advaità (monism, non-dualism), Dvaità (dualismi and Visistàdvaità (qualified monismi, the Kevala Advaità school is commonly considered to be of a respectful standard. The Advaità Vedànta in this article refers to the Kevala Advaità school. 2 The word 'Parabrahmari in Advaità Vedantà technically signifies the absolute Brahman or absolute God. The word 'Brahman' with a capital Β is also used to signify the Parabrahman but in this article we prefer the latter to the former. 3 Upàdhyày was born in Khannyan, a small village about thirty-six miles north of Calcutta in an orthodox Bengali family of the Kuhn Brahmins (ritually the purest and socially the most elevated stratum of the caste!. In 1881 he was formally baptized, officially proclaiming his status as an 'Indian-Catholic'. See B. Animananda, The Biade, Calcutta, n.d., 44. His attempts at Indianizing the Roman Catholic Faith resulted in a substantial theological literature that could be characterised as uniquely Indian. For more details on the life of Upàdhyày see Bryan Lobo, Trinitarian theology as fides docens intellectum: An inference drawn from the Trinitarian the ologies of Thomas Aquinas, Brahmabandhab Upadhyay and Karl Rahner, Rome, 2009, 16-28. 4 This concepì will become clear later in the article. 5 Sankara, also called Adi Sankara, was considered a great monk and a philosopher-the</page><page sequence="2">160 BRYAN LOBO concept of God in Christian scriptures and tradition. The second, deals with Upàdhyày's reaction to the translation of nirguna as impersonal and his subse quent presentation of the Saccidànanda as tripersonal. In the final section some reflections shall be presented that would emerge from Upàdhyày's vision. The Background Sankara's idea of the Parabrahman It is a well known fact that for Saókara the ultimate reality is the Parabrahman.6 But did Saókara ever think of the Parabrahman as a personal Being? This is really not clear.7 Firstly, as of the relational understanding of ologian by the Hindus who Consolidated the Advaita Vedanta. The exact dates of his birth and death are controversial but it is commonly claimed that he lived in the latter half of the 8th century CE (788-820). According to tradition Sankara was born at Kàlady in Kerala, located in the south west of India. He belonged to the family of Nambudari Brahmins known for their rigid orthodoxy and caste purity. After completing his Vedic studies in only two years he became a Sanyàsin (a celibate who renounces the world for God-realisation). After the forma tion he received under his Guru, Govinda, Sankara travelled to Benares where he wrote most of his theological and philosophical works. Finally, as a wandering holy man, Sankara found ed four monastic study centres (mathas) in the four corners of India to promote a monastìc life-style of study and meditation, ali of which are stili existing today. As the greatest expo nent of the Advaità Vedantà Sankara, is considered to be the most famous figure in the entire history of Hindu reflective thought. For a short yet detailed account of Sankara's life see T.P. Mahadevan, Sankaracharya, New Delhi, 1968. 6 In Ad\&gt;aità Brahman is perceived in two modes: the nirguna Brahman which is Brahman unrelated to creation and the saguna Brahman which is Brahman related to creation. Literally nir guna signifies 'without ties' and saguna, 'with ties'. The nirguna Brahman is considered as the higher level concepì of Brahman referring to the Parabrahman. The Parabrahman (Brahman) should not be confused with Brahma, who is one among the triad: Brahmà, Visnu, Siva. The Trimurti, as the triad is popularly known, falls under the lower level conception of the divine namely the saguna level. The Avatàras, for instance, are placed under the saguna level in Ach'aità. 7 There is no small controversy regarding the personal / impersonal assertion of the Parabrahman. Great Hindu scholars like Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan held that the Parabrahman is impersonal. Modem Christian scholars of Hinduism, with the help of the Purusa sùkta (Rg Veda 10.90) argue just the opposite. Cf. Sijbhash Anand, Hindu Inspiration for Christian Reflection: Towards a Hindu-Christian Theoìogy, Anand, 2004, 10-14. There are also attempts of maintaining a personal Parabrahman in the thought of Sankara, with differing philosophical and theological arguments. Cf. B. Malikovsky, «The personhood of Samkara's Para Brahman» in The Journal of Religion 77 (1997) 541-562. Malkovsky asserts that Richard De Smet had written two articles on the personal interpretation of the nirguna Brahman, «to counteract the tendency of Western Sanskritists and Indian thinkers since the nineteenth cen tury to render nirguna as 'impersonal' and saguna as 'personal'» (559). Upàdhyày, a 19th cen tury Indian Brahmin who lived much before De Smet, had already laid the foundation for the correct understanding of nirguna and saguna. The reflections, in this article, revolve around this very foundation of Upàdhyày.</page><page sequence="3">TRIPERSONALISING THE HINDU GOD 161 person today, in principle, Sankara cannot accept the Parabrahman as a per sonal Being because the very idea of person would signify necessary relation and necessary relation would be seen as a limitation because it involves a dependence on another. Parabrahman, therefore, who is infinite and unlimit ed, cannot possess this limitation.8 Secondly, the world which is mistakenly taken to be real by unenlightened humans is in the Advaitic God experience actually unreal.9 The Parabrahman then cannot be relating to something that is unreal or essentially an illusion. Thirdly, Sankara perceives the Parabrahman to be one-only-without-a-second. This would mean that the Parabrahman is alone, a monad by himself, but residing in total bliss. It is only when the Parabrahman is seen in relation to the world that a distinction has to be made between the highest Brahman namely the Parabrahman as nirguna and the lower Brahman as saguna. The saguna Brahman alone is related to the world which in the final analysis is an illusion, a dream.10 Consequently positing personality to the Parabrahman would be heretical to Sankara's idea of the Parabrahman. On the other hand the neti neti (not this, not this, Brhad-àranyaka Upanisad. 2.3.6) for mula is applied to the questions regarding the attributes of the Parabrahman. As regards the attributes or qualities, nothing can be asserted of the Parabrahman in a positively conceptual way considering the anthropomorphic and finite nature of such conceptualizations. But to avoid the talk about the Parabrahman to fall into a kind of a general void, Sankara, positively describes the nature of Parabrahman as Being-Consciousness-Infinity (Sat-Cit-Ànantya). The term 'Ànantya' became 'Ànanda' among the later Vedantists making it Sat Cit-Ànanda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss).11 The Parabrahman is therefore Sat 8 Relation is seen as dependence because it presupposes a relation ad extra on some object or person. If God is taken to be One then any relation posited of him has to be posited ad extra. A relation ad intra would be inconceivable to the mind of Sankara. Brahman, in effect, does not depend on the world rather it is the world that is dependent on Brahman as the effect depends on the cause. The idea of tàdàtmya signifies this. See S. Grant, «Contemporary Relevance of Advaità» in B.J. Malkovsky (ed.), New Perspectives on Advaità Vedànta: Essays in Commemoration of Professor Richard De Smet, S.J., Leiden, 2000,153-154. This view is contested although not rad icallyby Bede Griffiths. Cf. A. Fernandes, The Hindu Mystical Experience, New Delhi, 2004,173. For an in-depth study on the concept of relation in Sankara, see S. Grant, Sankaracàrya's Concepì of Relation, Delhi, 1999. 9 For more information on the idea of the unreality of the world in Advaità, see G.

Johanns, «A synopsis of, To Christ through the Vedanta» in Light of the East Serìes, no. 4 (Ranchi, Catholic Press, 1930), 29. 10 According to Upàdhyày (The Twentieth Century, 1/3 [31s' March, 1901] 62), such higher / lower distinction of Brahman is found in the last section of the last chapter of the Vedànta Sùtrà, and is the keystone of Veddnfictheism. Upàdhyày's articles will be documented under the general title of his magazines. Most, if not ali the primary and originai sources on Upàdhyày could be found in the Goethals Library of St. Xavier's College, Calcutta. See also, J. Lipner - G.

Nevertheless, whether Sarikara understood the Parabrahman as a person in the modem sense of the term is doubtful, rather impossible. The philosophy of Sarikara was propounded by great scholars and commen tators and invariably the Parabrahman was presented as an impersonal God. According to them it was the highest realization that human beings could acquire in their search for God. If one apprehends the very foundation or the ground of ali existence, in his attempi at brahma-jijnàsà (desire to know the nature of Brahman), through the Advaitic experience in which God is pro pounded as the impersonal God, then any notion of the personal God is bound to be taken as a lower level idea or as mentioned in Advaita, as the notion of the saguna Brahman. The Christian God who is historically encountered as a personal God therefore recedes into the background at the saguna level. This is precisely what Upàdhyày will challenge on the basis of the Saccidànanda13 affirmation of Sarikara. Before we deal with it, we need to briefly look into the personal / tripersonal God encountered in Christian Scriptures and tradition. The Personal God in Christian Scripture and Tradition In the Old Testament The idea of God as personal appears to the reader at the very outset of the Old Testament. In the book of Genesis we have God talking to Adam and Ève (Gen 3:8-19); making a covenant with Abraham (Gen 15:17-21); wrestling with Jacob (Gen 32:22-32). God sees (Gen 1:4); hears (Ex 16:12); God is jealous (Ex 20:5) and faithful (Dt 7:9); God calls (1 Sam 3:4); laughs (Ps 2:4); God loves much more than a mother who loves her child (Is 49:15). Many more references could be given from the Old Testament presenting a God who lives and relates to his people as a personal Being. The experience of God of the Israelites appears to have been portrayed too anthropomorphically. Such language need not be per ceived as a mere superimposition of human characteristics on the Divine Being, rather, it offers a revelation of God historically and existentially experienced. Ludwig Kòhler states that the intention of the anthropomorphisms of the Old Testament 12 For further discussion on the Sat-Cit-Ananda as essential and not attributive to the Parabrahman, see Ram Pratap Singh, The Vedànta ofSankara: A Metaphysics ofValue, voi. 1, Jaipur, 1949, esp. 80-85. 13 The threefold characterisation of Brahman: Sat-Cit-Ànanda is also represented by a sin gle word Saccidànanda.</page><page sequence="5">TRIPERSONALISING THE HINDU GOD 163 ...is not in the least to reduce God to a rank similar to that of man. Το describe God in terms of human characteristics is not to humanize him. That has never happened except in unreasonable polemic. Rather the purpose of anthropomorphisms is to make God accessibile to man. They hold open the door for encounter and controver sy between God's will and man's will. They represent God as person. They avoid the error of presenting God as a careless and soulless abstract Idea or a fixed Principle standing over against man like a strong silent battlement. God is personal. He has a will, he exists in controversy ready to communicate himself, offended at men's sins yet with a ready ear for their supplication and compassion for their confessions of guilt: in a word, God is a living God. Through the anthropomorphisms of the Old Testament God stands before man as the personal and living God, who meets him with will and with works, who directs his will and his words towards men and draws near to men. God is the living God (Jer 10:10).14 In the New Testament The personal identity of God reaches scandalous proportions for the Jews in the preaching of Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus, by addressing God, the ali powerful cre ator and liberator, as Abba, was shocking the Jewish hierarchy beyond lìmits. «Jesus carne across as expressing a unique filial consciousness and as laying claim to a unique filial relationship with the God whom he addressed as 'Abba'».15 The Synoptic Gospels are unanimous in presenting Jesus as the Son of God. They show others recognizing Jesus as the Son of God. To name a few: the cen turion after the death of Jesus (Mk 14:33; 16:16; Mt 27:54); the angel announc ing his birth as the Son of God (Lk 1:32-35); the evil spirits tempting him or nam ing him with the stime title (Mt 4:3, 6; Lk 4:3,9,41; Mk 3:11; 5:7). This title given to Jesus was neither like the one used in the olden times for Kings (Ps 2:7), Prophets and Israel (Ex 4:22), nor was it a title given to show some kind of adop tion or choice by God. Instead it was a title that implied Jesus' eternai divine sta tus. Talking about the title Son of God in the New Testament, McKenzie notes: «The use of the term reflects the developed faith of Easter and Pentecost. [...] There are, of course, metaphysical implications in the title, and these implica tions are the source of the great theological discussions of the 3rd-5th centuries AD».16 The functions of Jesus «(his 'doing') depended on his ontological relation ship as Son of God (his 'being')».17 Later this became a valid pre-supposition of Pauline Christology and soteriology as well.18 The Holy Spirit, which will be given by the Father at the behest of the Son (Jn 14:15), is the «Advocate», «the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot 14 L.

Christian tradition: Defending the Tripersonaì God The monopersonal God of the Old Testament reveals himself as the triper sonal God in the New Testament. Not that there was an evolutionary change in God from one to three. He was always tripersonal but it needed the incar nation of the second person of the Trinity for a concrete understanding of the tripersonality of God even in the Old Testament. This was fundamentally seen through the context of the Christ event. It was therefore the Christ event that enlarged the vision of a monopersonal God to a tripersonal God. The problem that the early fathers of the Church faced was of how to pres ent the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (revealed in the New Testament), as a Triune God. The Greek word prosópon, which was used by Hippolytus to con note the distinctive individuality of one's social role, was used by Tertullian with its Latin translation of persona, for the three persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), in the Godhead (Adversus Praxean 2). The use of persona, was not in its originai sense of 'individuality' but in its Biblical sense of dialogue and rela tion.21 Tertullian finally contributed to some understanding of the Trinity by presenting God's oneness in substance and distinction in persons: una substan tia - tres personae (Adversus Praxean 2,12). But this definition rather than mak ing matters clear for one's faith led to more problems and heretical explana tions. We cannot get into the history of the Trinitarian heresies here. Finally the Church put an end to ali the divergent views by its Trinitarian explications at the Council of Constantinople (381 CE).22 In short God was three distinct per sons united in one divine substance. The philosophies of that time which tend ed to seek logicai arguments and consistencies in their conceptions about God could not in principle conceive of a God of seeming contradictions, namely of being One in Three and Three in One. As the Church fathers fought might and mane to present the three distinct persons of the Trinity united in substance, relation emerged as the only mode 19 Italics mine to show that the Johannine author is using personalistic language for the Holy Spirit. 20 W. Kasper, The God of Jesus Christ, New York, 1989, 210. Brackets mine. 21 For a detalied exposition of this aspect see, Cardinal J. Ratzinger, «Concerning the notion of Person in theology» in Communio [Engl], 27/3 (Fall 1990) 439-447. 22 Neuner - Dupuis 306/1-24, Denzinger-Schònmetzer 153-176.</page><page sequence="7">TRIPERSONALISING THE HINDU GOD 165 possible for the defence of that distinction. In the process the term 'person' carne to he understood as relation. This was evident from the way the Greek fathers presented the 'persons' in the Trinity as a communion (Koinónia), exist ing in a perichoretic way.23 For Augustine 'person' seemed as an answer to those who would ask «three what».24 Augustine in his attempt at trying to explain the threeness and one ness of the tripersonal God gave many images from creation in his De Trinitate. He found the mind of man with its memory, understanding and will as a good image of the Trinity which eventually led to the famous psychological analo gy.25 Kasper was right in stating that Augustine's psychological analogy deter mined the course of future speculation for Latin Trinitarian theology.26 Later, Aquinas, under the influence of Aristotelian metaphysics27 and scholastic epis temology,28 used the psychological analogy to present one of the most compre hensive, convincing and lasting treatises of the Trinity in Latin theology.29 Having thus clarified philosophically the way the Trinitarian dogma could he 23 See G. O'Collins, The Tripersonal God, London, 1999, 132. 24 De Trinitene, V, 10. Here Augustine acknowledges the great poverty of the human lan guage to answer the question «three what». But he feels it better to say something rather than be sileni because there was no going back on the conviction that there is plurality in God revealed as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 25 Books IX, X and XI of his De Trinitate deal concretely with Augustine's Psychological image or the mental image of the Trinity. 26 W. Kasper, The God of Jesus Christ, 272. 27 Aristotle through logicai arguments reaches the conclusion that the intellectual activity is the life of God: «for intellectual activity is life, and God is that activity; and the essential activity of God is the life which is best and eternai" (Metaphysics, XII, 7 [1072b26]). Since ali operation tends towards the good, the intellectual operation in God also tends towards the same giving Him the greatest pleasure (Metaphysics, XII, 7 [1072bl6]). The greatest good is God Himself. It there fore follows that God has to be thinking about himself which gives Him the greatest pleasure. 28 The Scholastic (Thomistic) epistemology in short (which is also Aristotelian in origini, is that the knower becomes one with the object that he knows thereby becoming the known. This conclusion depends upon the theory that like is known by like, simile simili cognoscitur (Summa Theologiae, (henceforth ST), la., q. 84, a. 2, responsio). Here Aquinas quotes Aristotle, De Anima 1, 2 (404bl7). Aquinas also holds the Aristotelian idea of the intellect which is understood as a writing tablet on which nothing is written (ST la., q. 84, a. 3, sed contro). Thus it is always in potency and its knowing anything is always in act in the sense that it comes to know the essence of the object by having the form of the object impressed upon it (which is immaterial). The final act of knowing is the word (verbum mentis) which contains the definition of the object known (which in turn contains the explanation of the essence of the object). For a detailed explanation of what I have said above see F. Copleston, A History of Philosophy, voi. II, London, 1950, 388 398. In God the object of His knowledge is He Himself, which gives rise to the Word (it proceeds as subsisting in the same nature unlike in human beings), and in this knowing He gets the great est pleasure which is signified as love by Aquinas. The Father therefore is the principle without principle, Son being the Word that is generated (Generation within the Godhead is eternai) from the Father, and the Holy Spirit is the love that flows from the Father and Son. ST la, qq. 33-37. 29 See ST la, qq. 27-43 for Aquinas' detailed exposition of the Trinity.</page><page sequence="8">166 BRYAN LOBO understood, Aquinas does not preach a comprehension of the Trinity, instead he perceives it as a way to understand analogically the ineffable Mystery of the Trinity which always remains beyond comprehension. In Christian tradition there are saints who have had the vision of the Trinity in symbolic ways. St. Ignatius, for example, sees the Trinity as three musical keys. We cannot get into the mystical Trinitarian experiences of the saints in detail here. The point that needs to be noted is that even in the spir itual tradition of the Catholic Church the Trinitarian dogma has invariably been maintained by the saints who had profound mystical experiences of God. Divine experience, in their case, has not necessarily refuted the Trinitarian mystery expressed in the Trinitarian dogma instead reinforced its foundation. Upàdhyày, on the other hand not only stood by the Trinitarian mystery to the very end but applied the Thomistic presentation of that mystery to the saccidànanda of Sankara, in turn revivifying it with a fresh personality that is three dimensionai. The Parabrahman is tripersonal The main contention of Upàdhyày was that the Parabrahman is personal because he is Sat-Cit-Ànanda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss). It was only from this premise that he could develop his Trinitarian theology using the Thomistic argument. With this conviction in mind he could not accept the translation of nirguna into 'impersonai'. Translation of Nirguna into 'Impersonai' The problem of the impersonal reality of the Parabrahman arises from the translations that ensued on the works of Sankara, during the time of Upàdhyày.30 It should be noted that the translations into English were done by Christian schol ars or Western scholars who had come from Christian backgrounds. Since rela tionship was intrinsic to the idea of a person, it was naturai that a Being not hav ing relations with anybody would be considered as impersonal. It did not there fore mean that the translation from nirguna to 'impersonal' was justified because nirguna could very well have been translated as 'tie-less' (the same as Upàdhyày would suggest). In their logie if 'unrelational' was against personal it had to be impersonal. Therefore the Parabrahman is impersonal. It is also interesting to see that the word 'impersonal' was not problematic for other scholars except for Upàdhyày. One notes this phenomenon in the writings of A. Hegglin, S.J., who defines thesim, in contrast to Advaità, as «that system of philosophy which teach 30 Cf. G. Thibaut, «The Vedànta Sùtras of Badaràyana with the commentary by Sankara», part 1 &amp; 2, The Sacred Books of the East, voi. 34 &amp; 38, Oxford, 1890.</page><page sequence="9">TRIPERSONALISING THE HINDU GOD 167 es the existence of a Personal God, infinitely perfect and independent, creator of the universe out of nothing, the Preserver and Ruler of the world».31 Hegglin gives names of some scholars who would go with his line of thinking. He mentions the names of Prof. Williams, Apte, Rev. Goreh, Murdoch, Rev. Lai Dey, Prof. Frazer, Prof. Weber and Prof. Gough.32 He quotes Gough, the author of the philosophy of the Upanisads as asserting, «There is, according to the Vedànta, but one substance or reality, and this is the supreme spirit, the impersonal self».33 He also quotes Weber on Vedànta, «The notion that creation is but an illusion, and that the tran scendental Brahman is alone the Real, but throning in absolute infinitude without any personal existence, is the fundatmental doctrine of this system».34 With 'impersonal' being the common denominator used to express the Parabrahman of Advaità or even Vedànta, it was evident that George M. Thibaut, an Indologist and Professor at Varanasi and Allahabad,35 translated the nirguna as impersonal when he translated the dense work of Sankara's Vedànta Sutras, into English. It is the response, rather the reaction of Upàdhyày to this translation that is enlight ening and has in fact set the tone for this whole article. Upàdhyày's response to the translation of 'Nirguna' into 'Impersonai' Upàdhyày vehemently opposed this translation of M. Thibaut. It was evident by the forceful language he uses in his article where he comments, «M. Thibaut has, to the great misfortune of the civilised world, seen the Vedanta through coloured glasses [... He] has been subject to a huge misconception [...]. Nothing can be more unjust than to translate nirgunam as 'impersonai'».36 In the ensu ing argument in which Upàdhyày tries to validate his point it is interesting to note how he finally presents the nirguna Brahman itself as supra-personal «to avoid confusion», which literally would involve the dynamics of being person al, that in its very definition embodies relatedness, although in a different way or shall we say in an analogical way? Upàdhyày writes, «He (Parabrahman) is 'nirguna', lit., tie-less, because 'guna' means rope, a tie».37 To be «tie-less» would mean to be unrelated. Having maintained this about the Parabrahman he later concludes toward the end of the paragraph, «To be a person is to be related. A person is self-conscious, free 31 A.

To avoid confusion he may be called supra-personal».38 In this way he could affirm the personhood of God because he prepares the reader a little before by affirming that intelligence (cit) and bliss (ananda) are not attributes of the Being, God (Parabrahman), instead they are essential to his nature. Since guna ordinarily means attribute and since we are dealing with the nirguna Brahman, we are talking of God, without attrib utes. The God who is Being-Intelligence-Bliss, is evidently self-conscious and free which in turn are the premises for the definition of a person. The Parabrahman is therefore a person. The Sanskrit language, on the other, hand has no proper equivalent for 'person'.39 Hence, logically, Sankara would not have had the concepì of a per 38 Ibid. It would be helpful to note here that some modem Christian theologians in their portrayal of the Upanisadic mystical experience of the Divine tend to use the word 'transper sonal'. Painadath notes that in this kind of an experience, «the Divine is experienced as the transpersonal Ground of being». See S. Painadath, «Spiritual encounter of East and West: The interpersonal and the transpersonal streams of Spirituality» in Jesuits in Dialogue: Toward a Theology for Interreligious Dialogue, Rome, 2003, 9. Cf. J. Lipner, «Samkara on Metaphor» in R.W. Perret (ed.), Indian Philosophy of Religion, Dordrecht, 1989, 169, no. 9., quoted in B.J. Maekovsky, «Life and work of Richard V. De Smet, S.J.» in New Perspectives on Advaita Vedànta, 14-15, ft.nt., 28. Firstly, is 'transpersonal' being used instead of the popular Hindu usage of 'impersonai'? Secondly, could 'transpersonal' be seen as 'supra-personal'? Learning from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, we could answer in the positive because there, the pre fixes 'trans' and 'supra' signify 'beyond'. Although we should be careful not to understand 'beyond' to mean 'wìthout', because then that would not be in keeping with the hermeneutics of Upadhyay. Would 'supra-personal' be more appropriate than 'transpersonal'? The former seems to maintain the tension between personal and impersonal better than the latter. Probably modem Christian scholars are trying to maintain this subtle tension by using the word 'transpersonal' for 'impersonai' to mean that 'transpersonal' is not categorically 'imper sonai' but dialectically 'impersonal-personal'. Allow me to continue with a caution to clearly qualify the use of 'transpersonal', especially because in modem times the prefix 'trans' is loaded with a sense of geographic displacement or change (e.g. transatlantic, trans-Siberian, transplant, transfer, transmigration, etc), which, more than giving the impression of going beyond, signifies leaving behind, or giving up a place or a body, in the case of transmigration of souls. 'Transpersonal', then, could be understood as a leaving behind of the personal sense which would eventually mean impersonal or not personal. The Hindu mystical experience, when characterised as transpersonal, could be misunderstood, in modem parlance, as giving up the personal overtones to signify the impersonal. We then go back to where we started. In other words we say the same thing that the Hindus say (impersonal) by using the word 'transpersonal', and the Hindu remains unfortunately oblivious of the richness of the person al dimension of God at the nirguna level (through the Sat-Cit-Ànanda hermeneutics of Upàdhyày) and continues to think of the nirguna Brahman as impersonal. 39 R.V. De Smet, «Ancient Religious Speculation» in Religious Hinduism, Allahabad, 1964, 46. The Sanskrit word 'purusa', is generally translated as 'person'. Cf. Anand, Hindu Inspiration for Christian reflection, 10. On the basis of this fact, however, one cannot equate the western or Christian definition of person that evolved and developed from the theology of Tertullian to Boethius who defined 'person' as «an individuai substance of rational nature»,</page><page sequence="11">TRIPERSONALISING THE HINDU GOD 169 son in human terms when talking positively of God as Sat-Cit-Ànanda (anantya). But Upàdhyày, precisely on the basis of the Sat-Cit-Ànanda affirms the personality of God. He could do this because he carried within him the Thomistic understanding of person that included intellectual nature and sub sisting relations. Since intelligence (cit) implies intellectual nature it follows that Parabrahman has to be personal. But fearing that such a characterization would be understood in a human way, Upàdhyày preferred the word 'supra personal' «to avoid confusion». He would have rather applied the word 'per son' to God in an analogical way. Eventually Upàdhyày presents the nirguna Brahman as a person (which would be totally against Sankara's understanding but well in keeping with the Christian understanding of God as personal). On the other hand if Upàdhyày argues that nirguna means unrelated, and «to be a person is to be related», then is he contradicting himself by presenting the nirguna Brahman as a person or (supra-personal)? Not really. This shall be briefly clarìfied in the next point. The problem of Relation solved: Moving towards the Tripersonal Parabrahman Nirguna which literally means unrelated, is a perfect application to the Parabrahman in the logie of Advaità philosophy since relation (as we have mentioned before) to an object outside oneself meant dependence and there fore a limitation to absolute existence. God, being absolute existence, cannot in his De Persona et duabus naturis centra Eutychen et Nestorium, 3 (PI 64, 1343). Later due to the Thomistic influence «relatio subsistens» was indelibly connected to the understanding of 'person' (5T la, q. 29). We cannot get into the whole argument of Aquinas here, but in the above quoted section of his Summa Theologiae, Aquinas, after agreeing in principie, with the Boethian definition goes beyond the definition re-interpreting it with more appropriate con cepts of «intellectual nature» instead of «rational nature» (ST la, q. 29, a. 3, ad 4), and «sub sistent relations» instead of «individuai substance» (Sila, q. 29, a. 4, responsio). Following the argument of De Smet we could assert that, «The uncertain status of the notion of 'person' in India is conditioned by the fact that it is foreign to the Sanskrit tradition and has no adequate rendering in any of the Sanskritic languages. [...] A closer equivalent of 'person' is purusa which means male, man. Philosophically, it was assumed to designate a sentient and usually an intellectual monad such as man's 'soul' (Jtvàtman), a god or a godly power, or 'the God within', but also, as in some verses of the Gita, to designate a cosmic entity, such as primor dial matter» (R. De Smet, «Towards an Indian view of the Person» in I. Coelho [ed.], Brahman &amp; Person: Essays by Richard De Smet, Delhi, 2010, 118-119). There have been Indian authors who have reflected on the concepì of Person. To name a few with their works: S. Radhakrishnan - P.T.

If 'person' signifies relation then eventually it cannot be applied to the Parabrahman. One seems to have arrived at an impasse here because the argument is fully valid and Upàdhyày was aware of its validity. The only way that he could get out of this conundrum was to take recourse to the Trinitarian concept of Christian theology. If God is taken to be one and not Triune, then there is no way but to accept the logicai proposition stated above. Even Sankara (who was well known for his arguing skills) would have hammered this very point to the utter dismay of his opposition. But the opposition using the very principle of Sankara's Sat-Cit-Ànanda, and combin ing it with the psychological analogy of Aquinas, could present him a person al God who is related within himself (ad intra), and not necessarily outside him self (ad extra). Following this logie Upàdhyày understood relation as not a lim itation because if God is Sat-Cit-Ànanda then it necessarily follows that God is tripersonal based upon Thomistic Trinitarian theology and therefore related within himself and not without. Relation without is conceived as dependence and a limitation but not within. If God is conceived as one but not triune then relation has to be understood as implying relation with an object outside (with out) and therefore a limitation, but if God is conceived as triune (that is one ness in threeness), then a relation is evident, but within, avoiding the limitation of a necessary relation without. In this way Upàdhyày personalises the Parabrahman, using the very system of Sahkara by interpreting it in the light of Thomistic Trinitarian theology. At this point we shall give some quotes from Upàdhyày himself to substantiate the point that we have made so far. In November 1897, Upàdhyày had given a lecture in the Framji Cowasji Hall in Bombay, the summary of which appeared in the following month's December issue of Sophia Monthìy. Here he is quoted to have said, External relationship indeed implies limitation; but not so internai relationship. The Infinite self-sufficient Being is related within Himself. He is not necessitated to enter into relationship with any objective unit external to Himself. The Subjective Self of God sees and contemplates the Objective self of God and in this single, eternai act are his knowledge and love fully satisfied.40 In the following quote we find Upàdhyày asserting that God is a person by rational argument. By reason we can also prove the personality of God. Every cause must be adequate to its effect. There can be no excess in the effect over the cause. If there be any then that excess will have no cause, which contradicts the first principle: every effect must have a cause. The First Cause, then, is adequate to its effect - the universe. Therefore, there can be nothing in the universe which is not contained in the First Cause in a pre-eminent way. 40 Sophia Monthly 4/ 12 (December, 1897) 3.</page><page sequence="13">TRIPERSONALISING THE HINDU GOD 171 We find there are beings endowed with intelligence and will; therefore the First Cause must contain intelligence and will pre-eminently. Therefore God is a person, the defi nition of person being an individuai having intelligence and will. We are aware that this proof is beset with many difficulties. But it can be shown that those difficulties can not upset our simple and logicai proof of the personality of God.41 Finally we give a quote from the same summary mentioned above, which is directly connected to the Trinity and the Personal God. «The Vedantist went further and proclaimed that this Infinite unity was no cold intellectual abstraction, but a Personal Being who knows ali, who watches over us with a Father's eye - a Being who is the plenitude of being; consciousness, pure and luminous, and bliss supreme: sat, chit, anand».42 It is obvious from the above arguments that for Upàdhyày God is a person because of intelligence and will. He therefore ultimately implies that the Parabrahman: the Sat-Cit-Ànanda, is in effect personal. The problem of rela tions is solved by falling back on the same concept of the Sat-Cit-Ànanda but this time giving it a three-fold interpretation within the context of the triper sonal God of Christianity. Therefore Sat-Cit-Ànanda is the Father, Son, Holy Spirit. We shall deal very briefly with this assertion of Upàdhyày through his Canticle to the Trinity. Canticle to the Holy Trinity (Vande Saccidànandam):43 Tripersonalising the Parabrahman The Canticle was originally written in Sanskrit and translated into English by Upàdhyày himself. The hymn is regarded by Gispert-Sauch as a «gem of Christian hymnology».44 It is an adoration of that ancient Parabrahman, the Supreme Being, whose eternai act finds, according to Catholic faith, an ade quate resultant within his own Self, who is not obliged to come in contact with finite beings for the sustenance and satisfaction of his nature. His knowledge is fully satisfied by the cognition of the Logos, the infinite Image of his being, begotten by thought and mirrored in the ocean of his substance. His love finds 41 Sophia Monthly (September 1897), in J. Lipner - G.

This word is normally used in adoration to God ('vande' would connote the similar meaning), and «is a compound of three traditional philosophical religious terms, which in their simple form are sat (existent, being), cit (consciousness, intelligence) and Ànanda (bliss, felicity)» (in G. Gispert-Sauch, «The Sanskrit Hymns of Brahmabandhav Upadhyay» in Religion and Society 19/4 [1972] 66).

But as we shall see, it expresses this faith mostly in words and expressions that emerge from the religious consciousness of India. Thus while unfolding the truth of the Christian revelation it does so in a manner that does not look completely foreign» (in «The Sanskrit Hymns of Brahmabandhav Upadhyay», 60).</page><page sequence="15">TRIPERSONALISING THE HINDU GOD 173 In his wonderful Canticle to the Holy Trinity Upàdhyày presente the Parabrahman in a tripersonal way. He explains, «The canticle sings of the Father-God (Parabrahman), the Logos-God (Sabda-Brahman) and the Spirit-God (Svasita-Brahman), One in Three, Three in One».46 Although Upàdhyày is not giv ing a theological explanation in this hymn we shall insert his theological pre suppositions wherever necessary for a better understanding of his ideas. In the last line of the first verse Upàdhyày refers to God as trisanga (thrice relat ed) which is in fact referring to the three-fold subsistent relations, the three Persons in God, which represents the inexpressible inter-subjectivity, a community.47 The first person, the Father, the Parabrahman, the Sat is dealt with in the second verse. He is called the Supreme Lord, the creator. His creation is con sidered intelligent (Iksana), and therefore a personal act, not an impersonal evolution.48 But this act of creation is outward and unnecessary (as Upàdhyày would always affirm). However there is an act which is necessarily within Being (Sat) itself because for the «Parabrahman, [...] to be is to know».49 Therefore knowing is the first act within oneself, which results in self-knowing. This act leads to a distinction within Being as the knowing self and the known self, nec essarily involving a self-related cit.50 The third verse, addressed to the Son, the Cit, has amidst some titles given to the Son, namely, «Infinite» and the «Word» (om), the title of the Purusa, which goes far beyond the Saihkhya terminology of an intelligent monad because He is prasù ta, begotten (in eternity).31 Here again the explanation of cit in the Parabrahman that leads to a second self in the act of knowing Himself, is taken for granted. Hence cit, which technically means, 'intelligence', is the ground of self knowledge where the one Τ becomes a second Τ by virtue of intelligence. Upàdhyày beauti fully puts it, «Parabrahman, the supreme Being, is essentially Cit [...]. He repro duces his self as Sabdabrahman (Logos) by Ikshana (beholding)».52 This behold ing of the Parabrahman is understood by Upàdhyày in a very Thomistic way as 46 Sophia Monthly (Oct. 1898), in J. Lipner - G. Gispert-Sauch (eds), Writings of Brahmabandhab Upadhyay, vol.l, 126. 47 See G. Gispert-Sauch, «The Sanskrit Hymns of Brahmabandhav Upadhyay», 70.

He can therefore very categorically state about the Parabrahman that, His eternai self-comprehension or word is to be conceived as identical with the divine nature and stili as distinct from the Supreme Being in as far as He, by com prehending Himself generates His word. God, knowing Himself by producing or gen erating His own image and word, is called Father; and God as known by Himself by this inward generation of the word is called the Word or the Son.53 The fourth verse, Upàdhyày dedicates, to the Holy Spirit who is Ànanda or bliss. By the very way he begins the verse it becomes clear that he is thinking of Ànanda, as not just an emotion or state of rest in the Godhead but as «someone» (a «One»), who In this context is presupposed as a person. He writes, «One who proceeds from the union of Sat and Cif, is the blessed (breath), intense bliss».54 Although here, as in the previous two, there is no argument to affirm the personhood of bliss (Holy Spirit), but it has already been solved in Upàdhyày's previous argument where he tries to assert a personal distinction within the God yet maintaining His unity by supporting it with the understanding of sattva, rajas and tamas55 as three distinct qualities that are found unitedly in prakriti (universal nature).56 For Upadhyay it was very clear that the Saccidànanda exhibited «the very nature of God as one essence possessed undividedly by Three Persons».57 His understanding of 'person' was also in keeping with the contemporary Christian theology. He notes, «The term 'person' [...] denotes a rational individuum, a being endowed with reason and free will».58 Finally to sum up we quote Upadhyay himself, The knowing Self is the Father, the known Self or the Self begotten by His knowledge is the Son; and the Holy Ghost is the spirit of reciprocai love proceeding from the Father and the Son. It is a necessity, Christian revelation teaches us for the subsis tence of the Godhead to be related within the term of Its essence without being divided. Thus lives the Supreme Being in the beatitude of triple colloquy, from eter nity to eternity, self-satisfied, self-sufficient, without any need of external commu nication or response from without.59 53 Sophia Monthly 2/4 (Aprii, 1895) 11, in T.C.

Saccidànanda is not a trini tarian concepì in Advaita. Upàdhyày transforms that term by giving it a triprersonal hermeneutics from the Christian perspective. The Saccidananda is the tripersonal God: Further reflections From the above it becomes very clear that Upàdhyày is re-visioning the monistic understanding of the Parabrahman through the trinitarian hermeneu tics of Thomas Aquinas. This re-visioning does not destroy the Advaitic concept of the Parabrahman because the Trinity in itself contains unity, in the sense the triune God is one God and three persons. The Trinity, in effect, gives Advaità an abundance, it makes it three dimensionai; from one it makes it three, without loosing the one. Upàdhyày is not doing this consciously. He was more interest ed in presenting Christianity in Hindu terms especially in Advaitic terms. In the process those very Advaitic terms attain a Christian flavour. The proposals that follow are some reflections that spring up in the whole context of what we have said above. Saccidànanda re-signified The term Saccidànanda which contains in its essence the teachings of the Upanisads (although appearing late in the Upanisads), is centrai to Advaità. It «is a sort of religious formula, comparable to those ancient àdesas or compact presentations of truths helpful for meditation and so often proposed in the Hindu tradition».60 It enjoys the status of the formulas like neti neti (not this, not this), tatvamasi,(\ am that), aham brahmàsmi, (I am Brahman), etc.61 When the formula of Saccidànanda is uttered in the Advaitc system it is pregnant with meaning. It carries within it the Advaitic experience. At the same time it is a positive statement made about the Parabrahman. This statement is philo sophically defended by later commentaries of which the Panchadasi is famous62 and was to be fully translated by Upàdhyày who could not complete it due to his untimely death. Continuing this philosophical trend, Upàdhyày, in his articles and magazines, defends the personality as well as the triperson ality of the Parabrahman through this very formula, as we have seen before. It is by doing this that he re-signifies the formula Saccidànanda. In fact he 60 See G. Gispert-Sauch, «The Sanskrit Hymns of Brahmabandhav Upadhyay», 66. 61 Cf. Ibid., 66. 62 See Srimad VidyAranya SwAmi, The Panchadasi, tr. sri Gopala Krishna, Bombay, 1912. The name of this book has been transliterated wlthout the diacritical symbols.</page><page sequence="18">176 BRYAN LOBO places himself in the very tradition of the earliest trends of Christian incultur ation where the words Logos and Persona were appropriated in the Christian system due to which they received meanings that did not destroy their origi nai meaning, instead added to them dimensions that were not perceived before but became perceptible after a Christian hermeneutics. The appropria tion of the word persona for the Trinitarian hypostasis eventually re-signified the word persona to the extent that from its originai meaning of 'individuali ty' it attains the Christian meaning of dialogue and relation.63 It was the God that we encountered in Scripture and in the person of Jesus Christ that styled our way of understanding person. Ratzinger argues, the concept of person arose from two questions that have from the very beginning urged themselves upon Christian thought as centrai: namely, the question "What is God?" (i.e., the God whom we encounter in Scripture); and, "who is Christ?" In order to answer these fundamental questions that arose as soon as faith began to reflect, Christian thought made use of the philosophically insignificant or entirely unused concept prosopon = 'persona'. It thereby gave to this word a new meaning and opened up a new dimension of human thought.64 On similar lines, Upàdhyày gave the Saccidananda a new dimension by pre senting it as three dimensionai through his Christian reading of the same. It is through this reading that the tripersonal aspect of the Saccidananda has been excavated and brought to the fore, rendering it more brilliant and stili more mysterious. Maintaining the mystery of the Parabrahman In the Advaità system if Saccidananda is proclaimed as the nature of the one supreme God and if it is taken to be the last insight that one could get about the nature of God, then it remains very much at the philosophical level because that insight was logically reached by Aristotle as well. In his Metaphysics this is precisely his search and finally he arrives at a Being, whose essence is to exist intellectually and in happiness. If Saccidananda is the last word on the inner nature of God then the Advaitin with Aristotle can jump up victoriously and say that finally I have discovered it: God is Sat-Cit-Ànanda. It would mean that I have understood this God and there is nothing more left to know about Him. He has been reflected upon by acute self-awareness with the resultant being that his nature is Sat-Cit-Ànanda. If Aristotle would have been present today to hear that his conclusion, which he had reached through log 63 For a detalied exposition of this aspect see, J. Ratzinger, «Concerning the notion of Person in theology», 439-447. 64 Ibid., 439.</page><page sequence="19">TRIPERSONALISING THE HINDU GOD 177 ical enquiry, about Being as intelligent and happy within Himself or (Itself), is the same conclusion of the spiritual enquiry (experience) of the Advaità sys tem then he would certainly arrive at a fallacious conclusion that the ineffa bleness of God does not exist. God can be understood and there is nothing else to wonder about Him. But then on the other side of the spectrum it is the neti, neti of Advaità that really challenges this very assertion of Advaità. It is in neti neti that the seeker finally says «I don't know», rather, «I know but I cannot express it». It is here that the mystery is maintained only to allow another mystery to sink in which is expressed in words but stili remains a mystery and that is the Trinity. To say that God is Father, Son and Holy Spirit, three persons, one in substance but distinct in relations, is not explaining away the mystery because it stili remains a great puzzle as to how can three persons be ali one and at the same time different. How can Monotheism allow tripersonality? Does it not amount to tritheism? More than clarity this creat ed and stili creates confusion. The temptation of clearly understanding God in human categories was always at work against which the early Church wrestled right from the inception of its trinitarian assertion. Rather than explaining away the mystery of God it entered deeper into it recognising that it has stili not captured it and never will. The trinitarian affirmation that maintains the mystery finally bows down to the ineffableness of God. It is to this trinitarian mystery that the philosophy of Aristotle was put to use as an ancilla theolo giae by Thomas Aquinas, and it is to this trinitarian mystery that the philos ophy of Advaita was put to use by Upàdhyày through its Saccidànanda formu la, maintaining fully the mystery of the Parabrahman in its initial and hum ble whisper of «neti neti». The Impersonai God is dead If for Nietzsche God was dead then for Upàdhyày the impersonal God is dead. As we said before, Hindu scholars of Advaita have interpreted the Parabrahman as the impersonal God the worship of whom or which, is con sidered as the highest form of worship.65 The question that arises is that when 65 «Radhakrishnan maintains that understanding God as personal does not fully satisfy our religious needs. Therefore the worship of the Absolute is higher that that of a personal God» (Anand, Hindu Inspiration For Christian Reflection, 11). Vivekananda is quoted to have sald, «The highest ideal in our scriptures is the impersonal and would to God everyone of us here were high enough to realise that impersonal ideal» (Ibid., 10-11). Malkovsky finds T.M.P. Mahadevan, an Indian Advaità scholar, to have affirmed the divine personhood of Brahman (in «Life and work of De Smet.. », 15, ft.nt. 29). He gets this information from De Smet, «Towards an Indian view of the Person» in M. Chatterjee (ed.), Contemporary Indian Philosophy, ser. 2, London, 1974, 51. Mahadevan notes (as quoted by Malkovsky), «if the Brahman of Sankara is anything, it is surely not impersonal». De Smet according to Malkovsky attributes this «important linguistic change» regarding the personhood of Brahman to the</page><page sequence="20">178 BRYAN LOBO they mentioned the impersonal Brahman, did they mean that He was not a 'Subject? Is the nirguna Brahman a kind of object or shall we say 'subjectless Being'? They could not have called him an object because firstly, if I am a sub ject and if I am Brahman then Brahman has to be a subject. Secondly, if He is a 'subjectless' Being then it is a contradiction because Being cannot be with out consciousness as to lack consciousness means deficiency in Being.66 It is on the basis of these premises that Upàdhyày would proclaim a personal Parabrahman. But the point that we are trying to make is that, the imperson alists have no option but to maintain a Parabrahman that is a Subject there fore self-conscious and therefore a person. Parabrahman is pre-eminently personal right from the start. Otherwise the impersonalist Advaitins would be preaching a New-Age, Theosophist kind of God which is a Divine principle, a kind of a divine immanent energy that is ethereal, a life giving force that has to be harnessed and to which ali beings have to be attuned to and once this attuning reaches perfection there is moksha, liberation, Nirvana, awakening and enlightenment. Great sages, spiritual leaders, swamis and gurus are attuned to this principle or become one with this principle feeling one with the Divine and hence are able to utter the Mahavakya for themselves; Aham Brahmasmi (I am Brahman). This New Age kind of God concept is rather dif fuse.67 The danger of such impersonal theology is that it leads one into a no God's land. Once again we could blame the translators for translating nirguna as impersonal which was subsequently used by Hindu Scholars. Probably Sarikara may have really meant a personal being whose deep personal experi ence led him to forget himself in a way that St. Paul declares, «It is no longer I that live but Christ that lives in me» (Gal 2:20). He gave expression to this experience in an Advaitic, non-dualistic way, which seemed to unfortunately influence of the Catholic scholars in India. De Smet's characterisation of Mahadevan's state ment as an «important linguistic change» seems more accurate than Malkovsky's characteri sation of an «affirmation of the divine personhood of Brahman». Mahadevan is not making any affirmation of Brahman 's personhood. He is only negating the impersonality of Sankara's Brahman and negating impersonality does not ipso facto mean affirming personality. A nega tion is not a necessary affirmation of the opposite. To affirm the personality of the Parabrahman, Mahadevan, as a Hindu Advaitin, would have to face unlimited and insur mountable philosophical problems. Although there are Christian ways of answering these problems the primary problem would be of relation which seems to deny the divine transcen dence. Malkovsky makes note of this problem of relation in his «The personhood of Samkara's Parabrahman», 562. Mahadevan, in effect, plays it safe by negating the imperson ality of the Parabrahman, but his perception of the Parabrahman could be the same as, for example, Vivekananda's perception of the Parabrahman, when he calls it impersonal. 66 This is a basic Thomistic argument but one finds it also among some Christian Hindu scholars like, B.

Even Thomas Aquinas after supposedly having the Divine vision towards the end of his life never abrogated his writings on the Trinity and other theological topics. Rather he compared it to a Straw which goes to say that the Christian myster ies are truths, but ineffable, and beyond comprehension. The triune God is therefore not negated through that experience of Aquinas, instead it is upheld with a greater and mysterious profundity. God's personality is much greater than we can imagine, «Supra-personal», to repeat what Upàdhyày said. We can certainly talk about that personality analogically through our personality. It is in the reality of the personal rather a tripersonal God that we are persons but in a much human way. The problematic of the concept 'person' and its understanding in the light of God's tripersonality The concept of person, with its rationalistic definition, after Descartes, attained a kind of individualism which practically destroyed its communitari an dimension. Today many theologians frown on the usage of persons for the Trinity especially after the critique of Rahner.68 But Rahner himself is not against the use of the concept of person. He is rather cautioning against a prevalent understanding of person that is harmful to the understanding of per son in God, which cannot be understood individualistically because then that would destroy the divine unity and lead to a tritheism.69 What is therefore required is a better understanding of the concept of person namely as «distinct manners of subsisting».70 Even if one thinks of abandoning the word 'person' and using «three distinct manners of subsisting» it does not help prayer and worship. O'Collins remarks, «Personal language for God makes our prayer and deep relationship to God possible. How could one adore and glorify Rahner's "three distinct manners of subsisting"».71 Rahner himself declares that «there is really no better word, which can be understood by ali and would give rise to fewer misunderstandings».72 Hence the concept of person remains and once again referring to the comment of Cardinal Ratzinger; the usage of 'person' in the Trinity, modified its understanding to the benefit of humanity. In the same vein, 'person' in the Trinity cannot be understood without relations. It is there fore no wonder that Aquinas had indeed placed his discourse on 'relations' 68 Cf. Κ. Rahner, The Trinity, London, 103-115. 69 Ibid. 70 Ibid., 114. 71 G O'Collins, The Tripersonal God, 175-176. 72 In Ibid., eh. 10, end note 2, ρ. 222.</page><page sequence="22">180 BRYAN LOBO before dealing with the 'persons' in the Trinity.73 If àtman is Brahman or if we are in the image and likeness of God (Gen 1:26), then we too are intrinsically relational beings yet distinct. It is by our understanding of persons in the Trinity, that our personhood has to be understood. Our personhood cannot be understood without relations imbued with self-giving love. In fact it is the self giving (kenosis) that is cruciai to understand the relations as well as the one ness of the persons in the Trinity. This understanding, then, would help in breaking the separations based on caste, creed, religion, sex and race because their existence would be an insult to the tripersonal Parabrahman itself. On the other hand the Parabrahman could effectively become the model of our communion and togetherness helping us to live like members of one family. O'Collins beautifully puts it: The Trinity's koinonia or absolutely blissful communion of love presente itself as the ultimate ground and goal of ali other such relations-in-communion. In a world where sharing and community have often tragically broken down, the perichoretic existence of the tripersonal God invites us to live in communion with each other and with our God. Because the divine life is one of total self-giving and unconditional sharing, human beings, because they are made in the divine image and likeness (Gn 1:26), are invited to exist in a communion and loving solidarity with each other and with the divine persons/4 Love or Bliss? Finally the question that arises is, if self-giving love is cruciai to the under standing of the inner nature of the Triune Godhead, then would it mean dis carding the term ànanda (bliss), which is again cruciai in the Saccidànanda experience of Advaità? In fact the article of Gispert-Sauch, «Ànanda, Hedonè and the Holy Spirit», argues precisely against this point.75 He leads the reader towards understanding that bliss is basically the non-dualistic unity of the Father and the Son. This bliss (ànanda) is precisely the Spirit. Rather than understanding the Spirit as love proceeding from the knowledge of the Father and the Son, it could be understood as a state of rest in the blissful union of the Father and the Son.76 He quotes Abhishiktananda extensively for this Advaitic way of understanding the spirit in the Godhead. The unifying aspect of bliss is true of love as well. Quoting Von Balthasar, Gispert-Sauch notes, that the Spirit as love expresses and seals the unity between the Father and the Son.77 Eventually the question of love or bliss cannot arise. We have to talk of love and bliss. Both the words can carry positive and negative connotations 73 Sria., qq. 28-29. 74 G. O'Collins, The Tripersonal God, 179-180. 75 Indica 16 (1979) 83-102. 76 Ibid., 94 -97 77 Ibid., p. 96.</page><page sequence="23">TRIPERSONALISING THE HINDU GOD 181 based upon contexts. This then is important even when seeing how Abhishiktananda or Gispert-Sauch have understood ànanda as bliss of union between the Father and Son because they understood it in the context of the Trinity. In Advaità union cannot exist because there is only one reality or to put it more appropriately reality is non-dual. It is not «I and Brahman are one» but «I am Brahman». Bliss, therefore, in Advaità if applied to the social con text could be understood as individualistic or in isolation to the detriment of social communion. It is only in the context of the Trinity that 'bliss' gains a unitive perspective. Both love and bliss go hand in hand in the Trinity or Saccidànanda, where love unites to rest in bliss. Applying this conclusion to the social context would mean perceiving self-giving love in blissful commun ion. In our self-giving love there is bliss, while in bliss there is self-giving love. It is as if the self-giving love of the cross is intrinsically connected to the bliss of the resurrection. We cannot separate one from the two. Pontificia Università Gregoriana Bryan Lobo, S.I.

In such a characteristically monistic paradigm the tripersonal God of Christianity appears as unacceptable and absurd before the perspective of an imperson al God - God without attributes (nirguna Brahmani - that enjoys a level higher than a personal God - God with attributes (saguna Brahmani. Nonetheless, the impersonal God, presumed as the highest God, Brahman (Parabrahman), is positively affirmed by Sankara, the greatest proponent of Advaità Vedànta, as Sat-Cit-Ànand (Being Consciousness-Bliss). This affirmation of Sankara convinces Brahmabandhab Upàdhyày, the founding father of Indian Christian theology, to propose a Tripersonal God to Advaità Ved?nta, thanks to his theological and philosophical formation in Thomism. Nell'Induismo, l'Advaita Vedànta concettualizza Dio come ekam èva advityam: uno solo-senza-secondo. In questo paradigma tipicamente monistico il Dio tripresonale del Cristianesimo appare inaccettabile e assurdo di fronte alla prospettiva di un Dio imper sonale, Dio senza attribuiti (nirguna Brahmani, che supera il concetto di Dio persona le, Dio con attribuiti (saguna Brahmani. Nonostante questo, il Dio impersonale, presup posto come l'altissimo Dio, Brahman (Parabrahmarii, è affermato positivamente da Sankara, il più grande maestro deìl'Advaita Vedànta, come Sat-Cit-Ànanda (Essere Coscienza-Felicità). Questa affermazione di Sankara convince Brahmabandhab Upàdhyày, il fondatore della teologia Cristiana Indiana, a proporre ad Advaità Vedànta un Dio tripersonale, grazie alla sua formazione nel Tomismo.</page></plain_text>
