<plain_text><page sequence="1">194I] The Counter-Revolution of Science By F. A. v. HAYEK V. SAINT-SIMONIAN INFLUENCE IT is not easy to-day to appreciate the immense stir which the Saint-Simonian movement caused for a couple of years, not only in France, but throughout Europe, or to gauge the extent of the influence which the doctrine has exercised. But there can be little doubt that this influence was far greater than is commonly realised. If one were to judge that influence by the frequency with which the Saint- Simonians were mentioned in the literature of the time, it would seem that their celebrity was as short-lived as it was great. We must not forget, however, that in its later years the school had covered itself with ridicule by its pseudo- religious harlequinades and the various escapades and follies, and that in consequence many men who had absorbed most of its social and philosophical teaching might well have been ashamed to admit their association with the cranks of Menilmontant and the men who went to the East in search of the femme libre. It was only natural that people should come to treat their Saint-Simonian period as a youthful folly of which they did not want to boast. But that did not mean that the ideas they had then absorbed did not con- tinue to operate in and through them, and a careful * This is the third and last instalment of the series of articles of which the earlier parts have appeared in the preceding issues of ECONOMICA. While, however, the first four sections of this essay were sufficiently self-contained to make unnecessary any reference to the fact that the series is intended as part of a larger work, it was less easy to avoid such references in the two sections which follow. Although this may be somewhat irritating to the reader, the author has decided to let stand various references to other parts of the larger investigation, as they serve to mark gaps which otherwise would be difficult to justify. It should, perhaps, be explained that in the intended larger work the present historical account of the " French phase " of the influence of " scientistic " views on social thought will be preceded by two theoretical studies of the character of individualism in social studies, and of the general nature of the influences exercised on them by the natural sciences and technology, and immediately followed by a series of chapters on the " German phase ", beginning with a chapter on " Comte and Hegel ". 281</page><page sequence="2">282 ECONOMICA [AUGUST investigation, which has yet to be undertaken, would probably show how surprisingly widely that influence has extended. Here we are not primarily interested in tracing the in- fluence of persons or groups. From our point of view it would signify far more if it could be shown that a siimilar situation has produced similar ideas elsewhere with- out any direct influence from the Saint-Simonians. Yet any study of similar contemporaneous movements elsewhere soon reveals a close connection with the French prototypes. Even if it is doubtful whether in all these cases we are really entitled to speak of influence, and whether we should not rather say that all those who happened to have similar ideas soon found their way to Saint-Simonism, it will be worth while to cast a rapid glance over the variety of channels through which this influence acted, since the extent of it is yet so little understood, and particularly because the spreading of Saint-Simonism also meant a spreading of Comtian positivism in its early form. The first point which it is important to realise is that this influence was by no means confined to people mainly interested in social and political speculation, but that it was even stronger in literary and artistic circles, which often became almost unconsciously the medium of spreading Saint-Simonian ideas on other matters. In France the Saint-Simonian ideas about the social function of art made a deep impression on some of the greatest writers of the time, and they are held responsible for the profound change in the literary atmosphere which then took place.' The demand that all art should be tendentious, that it should serve social criticism and for this purpose represent life as it is in all its ugliness led to a veritable revolution in letters.2 Not only authors who like George Sand or Beranger had been closely associated with the Saint-Simonians, but some of the greatest writers of the period such as H. de Balzac, V. Hugo, and Eugene Sue absorbed and practised much of the Saint- Simoniian teaching. Among composers Franz Liszt had been a frequent visitor to their meetings and Berlioz with a Chant d'Inauguration des Chemins de Fer applied Saint- Simonian precepts to music. I On this and the following see M. Thibert, Le RBle social de l'art d'aprcs les Saint-Simoniens, Paris, 1927, and H. J.

The main expositor of their ideas here became for a time Thomas Carlyle, whose in- debtedness to Saint-Simonian doctrine has been well studied and been proved beyond doubt.' He is the first of the many instances we shall meet where Saint-Simonism or Comtian and German influences so readily blended. Carlyle's views on the philosophy of history, his exposition of the Law of Progress in Sartor Resartus, his division of history into positive and negative periods, are all mainly of Saint- Simonian origin, and his interpretation of the French Revolu- tion is penetrated with Saint-Simonian thought. The in- fluence which he in turn exercised need not be stressed here, but it is worth pointing out that the later English Positivists recognised that his teaching had largely prepared the way for them.2 Better known is the influence which the Saint-Simonians exercised on J. S. Mill. In his Jutobiography3 he describes them as " the writers by whom, more than by any others, a new mode of thinking was brought home " to him and recounts how particularly one of their publications, which seemed to him far superior to the rest, Comte's early System of Positive Policy, " harmonized well with my existing notions to which it seemed to give a scientific shape. I already regarded the methods of physical science as the proper models for political. But the chief benefit which I derived at I See D. B. Cofer, Saint-Sintonisin in the Radicalism of T. Carlyle, College Station, I93I; F. Muckle, Henri de Saint Simon, Jena, 1908, pp. 345-380; E. d'Eichthal, " Carlyle et le Saint- Simonisme ", Revue Historique, vol. 82-3, 1903; and E. E. Neff, Carlyle atnd Mill, New York, z926, p. zio. Why in the case of Carlyle, as with so many others, the influence of the Saint- Simonians blended so readily with that of the German philosophers will become clearer lates. An interesting contrast to Carlyle's sympathetic reception of Saint-Simonian ideas is the exceedingly hostile reaction of R. Southey, who contributed to the Quarterly Review (Vol. XLV, July, i831, pp. 407-450) under the heading " New Distribution of Property " a very full and intelligent account of the Doctrine de Saint-Simonoi. Tennyson, in a letter written in 1832, still says that " reform and St. Simonism are, and will continue to be, subjects of the highest interest . . . . the existence of the sect of St. Simonists is at once a proof of the immense mass of evil that is extant in the nineteenth century, and a focus which gathers all its rays. This sect is rapidly spreading in France, Germany, and Italy, and they have missionaries in London." It is a striking fact that the social novel begins in England with Disraeli just at the time when one would expect Saint-Simonian influences to work in this direction; but there is, as far as I am aware, no evidence of any influence of the Saint-Simonians on Disraeli. 2 See C.

See also ibid., p. 6I, where Mill describe' how in 1821, at the age of fifteen, he had met in J. B. Say's house Saint-Simon himself, " not yet the founder of either a philosophy or a religion, and considered only as a clever original." B</page><page sequence="4">284 J-CONOMICA [AUGUST this time from the trains of thought suggested by the Saint-Simonians and by Comte, was, that I obtained a clearer conception than ever before of the peculiarities of an era of transition in opinion, and ceased to mistake the moral and intellectual characteristics of such an era, for the normal attributes of humanity." Mill goes on then to explain how, although he lost sight for a time of Comte, he was kept au courant of the Saint- Simonian's progress by G. d'Eichthal (who had also intro- duced Carlyle to Saint-Simonism),' how he read nearly everything they wrote and how it was " partly by their writings that [his] eyes were opened to the very limited and temporary value of the old political economy, which assumes private property and inheritance as indefeasible facts and freedom of production and exchange as the dernier mot of social improvement." From a letter to d'Eichthal2 it appears that he became so far convinced as to be " inclined to think that [their] social organisation, under some modi- fication or other . . . . is likely to be the final and per- manent condition of our race ", although he differed from them in believing that it would take many or at least several stages till mankind would be capable of realising it. We have here undoubtedly the first roots of J. S. Mill's socialist leanings. But in Mill's case, too, this was largely a pre- paration for the still more profound influence which Comte was later to exercise on him. 3 In no country outside France, however, did the Saint- Simonian doctrine seem to have roused greater interest than in Germany.3 This interest began to show itself surprisingly 'early. Already the first Organisateur seems to have reached a considerable number of readers in that country.4 Some years later it seems to have been Comte's pupil Gustave d'Eichthal who, here too, on a visit to Berlin in 1824, suc- ceeded in interesting several people in Comte's Systeme de Politique Positive, with the result that a fairly detailed G. d'Eichthal and C. Duveyrier came in I831 to London on an official Saint-Simonian mission. See the Address to the British Public by the Saint-Simoonian Missionaries, London, 1832, and S.

The July Revolution had made Paris once more the centre of attraction for all progressives, and the Saint-Simonians, then at the height of their reputation, were the outstanding intellectual movement in that Mecca of all liberals. A veritable flood of books, pamphlets and articles of the Saint-Simonians4 and translations of some of their writings5 appeared in German and there was little that could not be learned about them from German sources. The wave of excitement even reached the old Goethe, who subscribed to the Globe (probably since its liberal days) and who, after he had warned Carlyle as early as October, I830, "to keep away from the Societe St. Simonienne,"6 and after several recorded conversations on the subject, in May, 1831, still felt impelled to spend a I See P.

The whole German literary world seems to have been agog for news about the novel French ideas and to some, as Rahel von Varnhagen describes it, the Saint-Simonian Globe became the indispensable intellectual daily bread.2 The news about the Saint-Simonian movement appears to have been the decisive factor which in I83I drew Heinrich Heine to Paris3; and, as he later said, he had not been twenty-four hours in Paris before he sat in the midst of the Saint-Simonians.4 From Paris he and L. Boerne did much to spread information about the Saint-Simonians in German literary circles. Another important source of information for those who had stayed behind, particularly the Varnhagens, was the American Albert Brisbane, then not yet a Fourierist, but already spreading socialist ideas on his travels.5 How pro- foundly these ideas were affecting the Young German poets Laube, Gutzkow, Mundt and Wiebarg has been well described by Miss E. M. Butler in her book on the Saint-Simonian Religion in Germany, where with much justification she describes the whole Young German school as a Saint- Simonian movement.6 In their short but spectacular exist- ence as a group between I832 and 1835 they persistently, if more crudely than their French contemporaries, applied the Saint-Simonian principle that art must be tendentious, and in particular popularized their feminist doctrines and their demands for the " rehabilitation of the flesh ". 1 See Eckermann, Gespraeche mit Goethe, under October 20th, I830, and Goethe's Tage- buecher, under October 3Ist, I883o, and May 3oth, I831. 2 Rahel.

It seems that some over-enthusiastic German admirers of Saint- Simon even compared him to Goethe, which induced Metternich (in a letter to Prince Witt- genstein, dated Nov. 3oth, i835) to make the tart comment that Saint-Simon, whom he had known personally, " had been as complete a cynical fool as Goethe was a great poet."

The curious affinity which existed between the Hegelian and the Saint-Simonian ideas and which was strongly felt by the contemporaries will occupy us on another occasion. Here we are only concerned with the actual extent to which the younger Hegelian philosophers were directly affected by Saint-Simonian ideas, and how much therefore the decisive change which led to the separation of the Young Hegelians from the orthodox followers of the philosopher may have been partly due to that influence. Our actual knowledge on this point is small, yet, as there existed close personal contacts between the Young Germans and the members of what later became the Young Hegelian group, and as some of the former as well as some of the authors of the German works on Saint-Simon were Hegelians,l there can be little doubt that in the group as a whole the interest in Saint-Simonism can not have been much smaller than among the Young Germans. The period of German thought which is still so little explored and yet so crucial for the understanding of the later developments is the eighteen-thirties, during which it seems the seeds were sown which bore fruit only in the next decade.2 We meet here with the difficulty that after the Saint-Simonians had discredited themselves, people became most reluctant to acknowledge any indebtedness, especially as the Prussian censorship was likely to object to any reference to that dangerous group. As early as 1834, G. Kuehne, a Hegelian philosopher closely connected with the Young Germans, said of Saint-Simonism, "the French counterpart of Hegelianism ", that " it will scarcely any longer be permissible to mention the name, yet the basic feature of this view of life, which in this particular form has become a caricature, will have become completely 1 Of the young Germans, T. Mundt and G. Kuehne were both Hegelian University lecturers of philosophy, and the same is true of the authors of most of the books reporting on the philo- sophical aspects of Saint-Simonism, particularly M. Veit, Sainit-Simnon und der Saint-Simonis- mus, Leipzig, 1834; F. W. Carove, Der Saint-Simonismus uo1d die neuere fianzoesische Phi- losophie, Leipzig, 1931. I have been unable to procure another work of the same period, S. R. Schneider, Das Problem der Zeit und dessen Loesung durch die Associationi, Gotha, 1834, which judging from its title seems to contaiin an account of tlse socialist aspects of Saint-Simonism. 2 Cf. B. Groethuysen, " Les jeunes Hegeliens et les Origines du Socialisme en Allemagne," Revue Philosophique, Vol. 95, no. 5/6, I923, particularly p. 379.</page><page sequence="8">288 ECONOMICA [AUGUST embedded in social relations."' And when we remember that the men who were to play the decisive r6le in the revolt against orthodox Hegelianism and in the birth of German socialism, A. Ruge, L. Feuerbach, D. F. Strauss, Moses Hess and K. Rodbertus, were all in their twenties when the rage for Saint-Simonism swept through Germany,2 it seems almost certain that they all imbibed Saint-Simonian doctrine at the time. Only of one of them, although the one from whom socialist doctrines are known to have spread more than from anybody else in the Germany of the time, Moses Hess, is it definitely known that he visited Paris in the early thirties,3 and the traces of Saint-Simonian and Fourierist doctrines can easily be seen in his first book of I837.4 In the case of some of the others, as particularly in that of the most influential of the Young Hegelians, Ludwig Feuerbach, in whom Positivism and Hegelianism were so completely combined and who exercised great influence on Marx and Engels, we have no direct evidence of his having known the Saint-Simonian writings. It would be even more significant, if this Hegelian, who in providing a positivist Weltanschauung for the next generations of German scientists was to play a r6le similar to that of Comte in France, had arrived at his view independently of the contemporary movements in that country. But it seems practically certain that he must have come to know them in the forma- tive period of his thought. It is hard to believe that the young university lecturer in philosophy, who, in the summer of I832, when Germany was reverberating with discussions of Saint-Simonism, spent months in Frankfurt reading to prepare himself for an intended visit to Paris,s should, almost alone among men of his kind, have escaped their influence. It seems much more likely that, as in the case of others, it was precisely the fame of this school which drew him to Paris. And although the intended visit did 1 In a review of Isis friend Mundt's Lebenseirren, quoted by W.

If one reads his work with this probability in mind, any doubt disappears which one might otherwise have had whether the obvious resemblances between his work and that of Comte are accidental.' An important r6le in spreading French socialist thought in Germany during this period was also played by various members of the large colony of German journeymen in Paris, whose organisations became so important for the growth of the socialist movement and among whom for a time W. Weitling was the outstanding figure.2 He and numerous other travellers must have provided a continuous stream of information about the development of French doctrine, even before, in the beginning of the 'forties, Lorenz von Stein and Karl Gruen went to Paris for a systematic study of French socialism. With the appearance of the two books3 which were the results of these visits, particularly with Lorenz von Stein's most detailed and sympathetic account in his widely read Socialism and Communism in Present-Day France (I842), the whole of Saint-Simonian doctrine became common property in Germany. That Stein-incidentally another Hegelian who was most ready to absorb and spread Saint-Simonian ideas-was, with Feuerbach, one of the strongest influences that were brought to bear on Karl Marx's early development is well known.4 Yet the belief that it was only through Stein and Gruen (and later, perhaps, Thierry and Mignet) that Marx made his acquaintance with Saint- Simonian ideas and that he studied them at first hand only later in Paris, is probably mistaken. It seems certain that he was directly affected by the early wave of Saint- Simonian enthusiasm when he was a boy of thirteen or fourteen. He himself told his friend, the Russian historian M. Kowalewski, how his paternal friend and later father- in-law, Baron Ludwig von Westphalen, had been infected 1 See T. G.

The fact, often noted by German scholars,2 that many parts of Marx's doctrine, particularly the theory of the class struggle and certain aspects of his interpretation of history, bear a much closer resemblance to those of Saint- Simon than to those of Hegel, becomes even more interesting when we realise that the influence of Saint-Simon on Marx seems to have preceded that of Hegel. Friedrich Engels, in whose separate writings Saint-Simonian elements are perhaps even more conspicuous than in those of Marx, was at one time closely associated with some of the members of the Young German movement, particularly Gutzkow, and later received his first introduction to socialist theory from M. Hess.3 The other leaders of German socialist thought are similarly indebted. How closely most of Rodbertus' doctrines resemble those of the Saint-Simonians has often been noticed and, in view of the whole situation, there can be little doubt about the direct derivation.4 Among the leading members of the active socialist movement in Germany, we know at least of W. Liebknecht that he steeped himself in Saint-Simonian doctrine when still very young,5 while Lassalle received most of it from his masters Lorenz von Stein and Louis Blanc.6 7 1 See Maxim Kowalewski in: Karl Marx, Eine Sammlung von Erinnerungen und Aufsdtzen, herausgegeben von V. Adoratskij, Zirich, 1934, p. 223. Judging from a remark by W. Stlzbach in Die Anfdnge der materialistischen Geschichtsau.ffassung, Stuttgart, I9I I, p. 3, there seems to be also other independent evidence of Marx having studied Saint-Simonian writings while still at school. But I have been unable to trace it. 2 Apart from various earlier works by Muckle, Eckstein, Cunow and Sulzbach, see par- ticularly Kurt Breysig, Vorn historischen Werden, Vol. II, pp. 64 et seq. and 84.

The objections which have recently been raised against this contention by E. Thier, Rodbertus, Lassalle, Adolf Wagner, Zur Geschichte des deutscben Staatssozialismnus, Jena, I930, pp. I5-I6, seem to be due to an inadequate knowledge of the Saint-Simonian writings. 5 See F. Mehring, Geschichte der deutschen Sozialdemokratie, 4th ed., I909, Vol. II, p. I8o. 6 See Ch. Andler, I.c., p. IOI. 7 Another curious and yet completely unexplored case where Saint-Simonian influence on German thought seems to have been at work is that of the economist Friedrich List. There is at least evidence of his direct contact with Saint-Simonian circles. List came to Paris, which he had already visited in 1823-4, on his return from America in December, 1830. On his earlier visit he had already mnade the acquaintance of the first editor of the Revue Encyclo- padique, which during this second visit of his came into the hands of the Saint-Simonians and from August, 1831, onwards was edited by H. Carnot. List's interest, as that of the Saint-Simonians, was larg,ely in railway projects and any attempt to make contact with people of similar interests during his visit must have led him straight to the Saint-Simonians. We</page><page sequence="11">1941] THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION OF SCIENCE 291 5 We have not yet said anything about the relations of Saint-Simonism to later French socialist schools. But this part of their influence is on the whole so well known that we can be brief. The only one of the early French socialists who was independent of Saint-Simon was of course his contemporary Charles Fourier'-who, with Robert Owen and Saint-Simon, is usually regarded as one of the three founders of socialism. But although the Saint-Simonians borrowed from him some elements of their doctrines- particularly with respect to the relations between the sexes- neither he nor, for that matter, Robert Owen, contributed much to that aspect of socialism which is relevant here: the deliberate organisation and direction of economic activity. His contribution there is more of a negative character. As an economy fanatic he could see nothing but waste in the competitive institutions and surpassed even the Saint-Simonians in his belief in the unbounded possibilities of technological progress. There was indeed much of the engineer mentality in him and, like Saint- Simon, he recruited his pupils largely among the poly- technicians. He is probably the earliest representative of the myth of " scarcity in the midst of plenty ", which to the engineering mind seemed as obvious I20 years ago as it does now. Victor Considerant, the leader of the Fourierist school which gave their doctrines more coherence than did their know that List met Chevalier early and that he at least tried to make the acquaintance of d'Eichthal. (See his Schriften, Reden, Briefe, ed. by the Friedrich List Gesellschaft, Vol. IV, p. 8.) Two of his articles on railways appeared in the Revue Encyclopaedique. I have not been able to ascertain whether the Globe, from which he quotes in one of these articles (a passage for which the unsuspecting editor of the Scbriften searched in vain in the English Globe and Traveller,) was not, as seems much more likely, the Saint-Simonian Journal of that name. (See Schriften, Vol. V., 1928, pp. 62 and 554.) Some years later List translated Louis Napoleon's Idles Napoleoniennes, the Saint-Simonian tendencies of which we shall yet have to note. As it is now known that he wrote the first version of his chief work, the Nationale System der Politischen Oekonomie, during a third much more extended stay in Paris in the 'thirties as a prize essay and that in that essay he felt himself compelled to defend himself against any suspicion of " Saint-Simoniism " in the sense of communism in wnich it was then generally understood (Schriften, Vol. IV, p. 294), there can be little doubt that any marked resemblance to Saint-Simonian ideas we find in his later work are likely to be due to that source. And such similarities are indeed not wanting. Particularly List's conception of " natural laws of historical development ", according to which social evolution must necessarily pass througl definite stages, an idea readily accepted by the historical school of Germani economists, is most likely of Saint-Simonian origin. How strong in general the French influence on List was, of this his declamations against " ideology " bear witness.-That the other German author from whom the historical school of German economists derived its preoccupation with the discovery of definite stages of economic developmient, B. Hildebrandt, derived his ideas from the Saint-Simonians has been pointed out by J. Plen,e, Stamnsnformen der vergleichen- den Wirtscbaftstbeorie, Essen, 19I9, p. I5. ' See H.

Even the most original of the later French socialists, Proudhon, however much he may have contributed to political doctrine, was in his properly socialist doctrines largely Saint-Simonian.2 It can be said that by about I840 Saint-Simonian ideas had ceased to be the property of a particular school and had come to form the basis of all the socialist movements. And the socialism of I848-apart from the strong democratic or anarchistic elements which by then had been carried into it as a new and alien element-was in doctrine and personnel still largely Saint-Simonian. 6 Although there is already some danger that we may appear unduly to exaggerate the importance of that little group of men, we have by no means yet surveyed the full extent of their influence. To be inspirers of practically all socialist movements3 during the past hundred years would be enough to secure them an important place in history. The influence which Saint-Simon exercised on the study of social problems through Comte and Thierry, and the Saint-Simonians through Quetelet and Le Play is hardly less important and will occupy us again. A full account of the spreading of their ideas through Europe would have to give considerable attention to the profound influence they exercised on G. Mazzini,4 the whole Young Italian Movement and others6 See M. Dommanget, Victor Considerant, Sa Vie, Sont Oeuvre, Paris, 1929. 2 On the Saint-Simonian elements in Proudon's doctrine see particularly K. Diehl. Proudhonl, I888-1896, Vol. III, pp. 159, 176, z8o. 3 There may even have been a direct influence on early English socialism. At least one of T. Hodgskin's letters, written in I8zo soon after his return from France, shows fairly definite traces of Saint-Simonian ideas. See E. HalVvy, Thomas Hodgskin, Paris, 1903, pp. 58-9. I owe this reference to Dr. W. Stark. 4 Mazzini was in the years between 1830 and I835, particularly during his exile in France, in intimate contact with the Saint-Simonians P. Lerroux and J. Reynaud, and the effect of this can be traced throughout his work. See on this G. Salvemini, Mazzini (in G. d'Acandia, La Giovine Europa), Rome, 1915, passim, and 0.

Herzen in Russia,2 and others in Spain and South America.3 Nor can we stop here to consider the frequent occurrence of similar types who sometime rallied to the Saint-Simonian flag as did the Belgian industrialist, sociologist and benefactor Ernest Solvay,4 or the Neo-Saint-Simoniens who in post-war France published a new Producteur.5 Such conscious or unconscious re-births we meet throughout the last hundred years.6 There is, however, one direct effect of Saint-Simonian teaching which deserves more consideration: the founders of modern socialism also did much to give Continental capitalism its peculiar form; " monopoly capitalism ", or "finance capitalism ", growing up through the intimate connection between banking and industry (the banks organising industrial concerns as the largest shareholders of the component firms), the rapid development of joint- stock enterprises and the large railway combines are largely Saint-Simonian creations. The history of this is mainly one of the Credit Mobilier type of bank, the combined deposit and investment institu- tion which was first created by the brothers Pereire in France and then imitated under their personal influence or by other Saint-Simonians almost all over the European Continent. One might almost say that after the Saint-Simonians had failed to bring about the reforms they desired through a political movement, or after they had grown older and more worldly, they undertook to transform the capitalist system from within and thus to apply as much of their doctrines as they could by individual effort. And it cannot be denied that they succeeded in changing the economic structure of the Continental countries into something quite different from the English type of competitive capitalism.

For the Pereires the aim of their Cridit Mobilier was most definitely to create a centre of administra- tion and control which was to direct according to a coherent program the railway systems, the town planning activities and the various public utilities and other industries which by a systematic policy of mergers they attempted to con- solidate into a few large undertakings.' In Germany G. Mevissen and A. Oppenheim, who had early come under Saint-Simonian influence, went similar ways with the founda- tion of the Darmstaedter Bank and other banking ventures.2 In Holland other Saint-Simonians worked in the same direction,3 and in Austria,4 Italy, Switzerland and Spain5 the Pereires or their subsidiaries or connections created similar institutions. What is known as the " German " type of bank with its close connection with industry and the whole system of Effektenkapitalismus as it has been called is essentially the realisation of Saint-Simonian plans. This development was closely connected with the other favourite activity of the Saint-Simonians in later years, railway construction,6 and their interest in public works of all kinds,7 1 See Johann Plenge, Gruendung ufnd Geschichte des Credit Mobilier, Tuebingen, 1903, par- ticularly pp. 79 et seq., and the passage quoted there on p. I39 from the Annual Report of the Credit Mobilier for I854: "Quand nous touchons s une branche de l'industrie, nous desirons surtout obtenir son developpernent non par la voie de la concurrence, mais par voie d'association et de fusion, par l'emploi le plus economique des forces et non par leur opposition et leur de- struction reciproque."

Moldenhauer, Kreditpolitik und Gesellschaftsreform, Jena, 193z. But it may just be mentioned that the Pereires, after acquiring the Banque de Savoy with its note issuing privilege, in order to be in a position to put their theories into practice, became ardent advocates of "free banking " and the cause of the great controversy between the " free banking " and the "central banking " school which raged in France in and after 1864.

As Enfantin organised the Paris-Lyon- Mediterranee railway system, the Pereires built railways in Austria, Switzerland, Spain and Russia and P. Talabot in Italy, employing other Saint-Simonians as engineers on the spot to carry out their directions. Enfantin, looking back at the works of the Saint-Simonians in late life, was well entitled to say that they had " covered the earth with a net-work of railways, gold, silver, and electricity '".- If with their far-flung plans for industrial organisation they did not succeed in creating large combines, as was later done with the assistance of the Governments in the process of cartellisation, this was largely due to the policy of Free Trade on which France had embarked and of which some of the old Saint-Simonians, particularly M. Chevalier, but also the Pereires, were still among the chief advocates. But already others from the same circle, notably Pecqueur,2 were agitating in the same direction as their friend Friedrich List in Germany. Yet they could not succeed till another branch from the same stem, positivism and " historism ", had effectively discredited " orthodox " political economy. The arguments however which were later to justify a policy of supporting the growth of cartels were already created by the Saint-Simonians. However far their practical influence extended, it was greatest in France during the second Empire. Not only had they the support of the Press because some of the leading journalists were old Saint-Simonians3; the most important fact was that Napoleon III himself had at one time been closely associated with the group, had remained on friendly terms with some of its members and even committed himself to part of their ideas in his programmatic Idees Napoleoniennes and some other pamphlets.4 It is thus not surprising that the years of the second Empire became the great period of the Saint-Simonian realisations. So closely indeed did they become associated with the regime that its end meant more or less also the end of their direct influence in France.5 5 Quoted by G. Pinet, Ecrivains et penseurs polytechniciens, Paris, 1887, p. I65. 2 See C.

Even if this influence was tempered by others which in any case would have worked in the same direction, the statement of the German K. Gruen, which may conclude this survey, appears certainly in no way to exaggerate their importance. " Saint-Simonism," he wrote in I845, " is like a seed-pod that has been opened and whose husk has been lost, while the individual seeds have found soil everywhere and have come up, one after the other. It contains . . . . finally the scientific socialism, since Saint- Simon had throughout his life been searching for the new science."3 VI. SOCIOLOGY: COMTE, AND His SUCCESSORS I EIGHT years after the first Systeme de politique positive4 there began to appear that work of Comte to which his fame is mainly due. The Cours de philosophie positive, the literary version of the series of lectures which he had first started in I826, and then, after recovery from his mental affliction, delivered in I829, extended to six volumes which appeared between I830 and I842.5 In devoting the best 1 Cf.

But he never lost sight of the political task. The main philo- sophical work was duly followed by the definite Systeme de politique positive (4 vols., 1851-1854) which, in spite of all its bizarre excrescences, is a consistent execution of the plans of his youth. And if his death in 1857 had not prevented it, this would have been followed by the third part of the original plan, a similarly elaborate treatise on technology or "the action of man upon nature No attempt can be made here to give an adequate summary of the whole of Comte's philosophy or of its evolution. We are concerned only with the birth of the new discipline, of which Saint-Simon and the younger Comte had only dreamt but which the latter's mature works brought into existence. Yet as the whole of Comte's work is directed towards this end, this is not a sufficient restriction of our task. We shall have to confine ourselves to a consideration of those aspects of his immense work which either, because of their influence on other leading thinkers of the period, or because they are particularly representative of the in- tellectual tendencies of the age, are of special significance. They concern mainly the methods appropriate to the study of social phenomena, a subject which is extensively treated in the Cours. But it should perhaps be pointed out that it is because the subjects which mainly concern us are treated in that work that we shall confine ourselves to its contents and that we cannot accept the belief, at one time widely held, that there is a fundamental break between it and Comte's worth pointing out that the year 1842, in which the concluding volume of the Cours appeared and which for our purposes thus marks the conclusion of the " French phase " of the strand of thought with which we are here concerned, is also the year which more than any other may be regarded as the beginning of the " German phase " of the same development, with which we hope to deal on another occasion. In 1842 Lorenz von Stein's Sozialismus und Com- munismus im heutigen Frankreich and J. K. Rodbertus' first work Zur Erkenntnis unserer staatswirtschaftlichen Zustande appeared and Karl Marx sent his first essays to the publisher. In the preceding year Friedrich List had published his Nationale System der Politischen Oekonomie, and L. Feuerbac his Wesen des Christentums. In the following year there appeared W. Roscher's Grundriss zu Vorlesungen iuber die Staatswirtschaft nach historischer Methode. The special significance of this date in German intellectual history is well brought out by H.

A few further facts of Comte's life may be recalled here which will help to understand his views and the extent and limits of his influence. The most important feature of his career is, perhaps, that trained as a mathematician he remained one by profession. Through the greater part of his life he derived his income from coaching and examining in mathematics for the Ecole polytechnique-but the pro- fessorship at the institution which he coveted remained denied to him. The repeated disappointments and the quarrels caused by his recriminations, which in the end lost him even the modest positions which he held, explain to some extent his increasing isolation, his outspoken con- tempt for most of his scientific contemporaries, and the almost complete neglect of his work in his own country during his life-time. Although in the end he found a few enthusiastic disciples, it is on the whole not difficult to see why to most people he seems to have appeared a singularly unattractive figure, whose whole intellectual style has often repelled those who have most in common with him.2 The man who prided himself that in a few years of his youth he had absorbed all the knowledge from which he could con- struct a grandiose systematisation of all human science and who, through a great part of his life, practised a " cerebral hygiene " consisting in not reading any new publications, was not likely to be readily accepted as that preceptor mundi et universae scientiae he claimed to be. The excessive length and prolixity and the clumsy style of his mature works were a further bar to his popularity. Yet if this restricted the number of people who became directly acquainted with his work, it was made up for by the profound effect it had on some of the most influential thinkers of the age. Although largely indirect, his influence is among the most potent in the nineteenth century, certainly where the study of social phenomena is concerned. 1 The essential unity of Comte's thought, which had always had its defenders, has since G. Dumas' investigations (Psychologie de deux Messies positivistes, Paris, 1905) been accepted by practically all French scholars concerned with these questions. See on this the recent survey of the discussion in H. Gouhier, La jeunesse d'Auguste Comte, Vol. I, Paris, 1933) pp. I8-29, and the two works by P. Ducasse, Mdthode et intuition chez Auguste Comte and Essai sur l'origine intuitive du positivisme, both Paris, 1939. 2 Cf. the interesting confession by Mr. H. G. Wells in his Experiment in Autobiography, London, 1934, p. 658: " Probably I am unjust to Comte and grudge to acknowledge a sort of priority he had in sketching the modern outlook. But for him, as for Marx, I have a real personal dislike."</page><page sequence="19">1941] THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION OF SCIENCE 299 2 The whole of Comte's philosophy hinges of course upon the celebrated law of the three stages which we have already met in his early essays. His very task is determined for him by that law: all the simpler sciences like physics, chemistry, and biology having reached the positive stage, it was reserved for Comte to do the same for the crowning science of the human race itself and thus to complete the main development of the human mind. The stress which Comte himself and still more his interpreters have put on the three separate stages is, however, rather misleading. The great contrast is between, on the one hand, the theo- logical and the metaphysical stage (the latter being a mere " modification "' of the first), and, on the other, the positive stage. What he is concerned with is the continuous and gradual emancipation from the anthropomorphic inter- pretation of all phenomena2 which each science completely achieves only as it reaches the positive stage. The meta- physical stage is no more than the phase of dissolution of the theological stage, the critical phase in which man has already abandoned the cruder personalistic view which seeks spirits and deities in all phenomena, but has merely replaced them with abstract entities or essences which have as little place in the truly positivist view of science. In the positive phase every attempt to explain phenomena by causes or a statement of the " mode of production " is abandoned3; it aims at directly connecting the observed phenomena by rules about the coexistence or sequence or, to-use a modern phrase not yet used by Comte, at merely " describing " their interrelations by general and invariable laws. In other words, since the habits of thought which man had acquired in interpreting the actions of his own kind had long held up the study of external nature, and the latter had only made real progress in proportion as it got rid of this human habit, the way to progress in the study of man must be the same: we must cease to consider man anthropomorphically and must treat him as if we knew about him as little as we know about external nature. Although Comte does not say so in so many words, he comes very near, and therefore 1ICf. Cours, I, p. 9: " L'6tat metaphysique, qui n'est au fond qu'une simple modification generale du premier."

But that in the positive treatment of social phenomena man must not be treated differently from the way in which we approach the phenomena of inanimate nature is only a negative characteristic of the character which the new "natural science "2 of society will assume. We have yet to see what the positive characteristics of the " positive " method are. This is a far more difficult task, as Comte's statements on most of the epistemological problems involved are distressingly naive and unsatisfactory. The basis of Comte's views is the apparently simple contention that " the fundamental character of all positive philosophy is to regard all phenomena as subject to invariable natural laws, whose precise discovery and reduction to the smallest number possible is the aim of all our effort."3 All science deals with observed facts,4 and, as he states in a sentence which he quotes with pride from his essay of I825, "any proposition which does not admit of being reduced to a simple enunciation of fact, special or general, can have no real or intelligible sense."5 But the question on which it is ex- ceedingly difficult to find any answer in Comte's work is what precisely is meant by the " phenomena " which are all subject to invariable laws, or what he regards as " facts ". The statement that all phenomena are subject to invariable 1 Cours, III, pp. 188-9: " Le veritable esprit general de toute philosophie thiologique ou metaphysique consiste a prendre pour principe, dans l'explication des phenomenes du monde exterieur, notre sentiment immediat des phenomenes humains; tandis que, au contraire, la philosophie positive est toujours caracterisee, non moins profondement, par la subordina- tion necessaire et rationelle de la conception de l'homme a celle du monde. Quelle que soit l'incompatibilite fondamentale manifestee, a tant de titres, entre ces deux philosophies, par l'ensemble de leur developpement successif, lle n'a point, en effet, d'autre origine essentielle, ni d'autre base permanerite, que cette simple difference d'ordre entre ces deux notions egale- ments indispensables. En faisant predominer, comme l'esprit humain a dui, de toute necessite, le faire primitivement, la consideration de l'homme sur celle du monde, on est inevitablement conduit a attribuer tous les phenomenes as des volontss correspondantes, d'abord naturelles, et ensuite extra-naturelles, cc qui constitue le systeme theologique. L'etude directe du monde exterieur a pu seule, au contraire, produire et developper la grande notion des lois de la nature, fondement indispensable de toute philosophie positive, et qui, par suite de son extension graduelle et continue a des phenomenes de moins en moins reguliers, a dfi etre enfin appliquee a l'etude meme de l'homme et de la societe, dernier terme de son entiere generalisation. . . .

It evidently cannot mean that everything which appears the same to our senses must behave in the same manner. The task of science is precisely to reclassify the sense impressions on the basis of their coexistence with or succession on others so as to make it possible to establish regularities for the behaviour of the newly constructed units of reference. But this is exactly what Comte objects to. The construction of such new entities as the " ether " is definitely a metaphysical pro- cedure and any attempt to explain the " mode of pro- duction " of the phenomena as distinct from the study of the laws which connect the directly observed facts is to be proscribed. The emphasis lies on the establishment of direct relationship among the immediately given facts. But what these facts (which may be "particular" or " general " !) are does not become a problem for Comte, who approaches the question with an entirely naive and uncritical realism. As in almost all igth century positivism,' this concept is left exceedingly obscure. 3 The only indication of what is meant by the term " fact" as used by Comte we obtain from its regular conjunction with the adjective " observed ", together with his discussion of what he means by observation. This is of great importance for its meaning in the field with which we are concerned, the study of human and social phenomena. " True observation," we are told, "must necessarily be external to the observer" and the "famous internal observation is no more than a vain parody of it ", which presupposes the " ridiculously contradictory situation of our intelligence contemplating itself during the habitual performance of its owvn activity .2 Comte accordingly consistently denies the possibility of all psychology, that " last transformation of theology ",3 or at least of all introspective knowledge of the human mind.

To these only two legi- timate ways of studying the phenomena of the individual mind is later added, as the result of the creation of sociology, the study of the " collective mind," the only form of psychology proper which is admitted into the positive system. As regards the first of these aspects we need here say no more than that it is remarkable that even Comte should have fallen so completely under the influence of the founder of " phrenology ", the " illustrious Gall " whose " immortal works are irrevocable impressed upon the human mind ",3 as to believe that his attempt at localising particular mental " faculties" in particular parts of the brain should provide an adequate substitute for all past psychology. The " behaviourist " approach in Comte deserves rather more attention, because in this primitive form it shows its weakness particularly clearly. Only a few pages after Comte has confined the study of the individual mind to the observation of its " more or less immediate and more or less durable results " this becomes the direct observation of " the series of intellectual and moral acts, which belongs more to natural history proper " and which he seems to regard as in some sense objectively given and known without any use of introspection or any other means different from " external observation But Comte not only tacitly admits intellectual phenomena among his " facts " which are to be treated like any objectively observed facts of nature; he even admits, to all intents and purposes, that our knowledge of man, which we possess only because we are men ourselves and think like other men, is an indis- pensable condition of our interpretation of social phenomena. It can only mean this when he emphasizes that wherever we have to deal with " animal " life (as distinguished from merely vegetative life, i.e., those phenomena which appear 'Cours, III, p. 535- 2 Cours, III, p. 540. 3 Cours, III, pp. 533, 563, 570.</page><page sequence="23">1941] THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION OF SCIENCE 303 only in the higher part of the zoological scale),' investigation cannot succeed unless we begin with " the consideration of man, the sole being where this order of phenomena can ever be directly intelligible."2 4 Comte's theory of the three stages is closely connected with the second main characteristic of his system, his classification, or the theory of the " positive hierarchy" of the sciences. In the beginning of the Cours he still plays with the Saint-Simonian idea of the unification of all sciences by reducing all phenomena to one single law, the law of gravitation.3 But gradually he abandons this belief and in the end it becomes even the subject of violent denunciation as an "absurd utopia ".4 Instead, the " fundamental " or theoretical sciences (as distinguished from their concrete applications) are arranged in a single linear order of de- creasing generality and increasing complexity, beginning with mathematics (including theoretical mechanics) and leading through astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology (which includes all study of man as an individual) to the new and final science of social physics or sociology. As each of these fundamental sciences is "based" on those preceding it in the hierarchical order, in the sense that it makes use of all the results of the preceding sciences, plus some new elements peculiar to itself, it is an " indispensable complement of the law of the three stages that the different sciences can reach the positive stage only in succession in this " invariable and necessary order ". But as the last of these sciences has for its object the growth of the human mind and therefore particularly the development of science itself, it becomes, once established, the universal science which will progressively tend to absorb all knowledge in its system, although this ideal may never be fully realised. Here we are interested only in the meaning of the assertion that sociology " rests " on the results of all other sciences 1 Cours, III, pp. 429-30, and 494, P.P. I, p. 354. 2 Cours, III, pp. 336-7, cf. also III, pp. 2i6-7 and Early Essays, p. 219. It is interesting to note that while the passage in the early work states simply: "L'action per- sonelle de l'homme sur les autres etres est la seule dont il comprenne le mode, par le sentiment qu'il en a " (A. Comte, Opuscules de la philosophie sociale, I8I9-I828, Paris, 1883, p. I82), this becomes in the corresponding passage of the Cours (IV, p. 468): " Ses propres actes, les seuls dont il puissejamais croire comprendre le rnode essentiel de production."

This has nothing to do with the undeniable contention that the biological study of man as one of the most complicated organisms will have to make use of the results of all the other natural sciences. Sociology, as we shall see presently, does not deal with man as a physical unit but with the evolution of the human mind as a manifestation of the " collective organism" which mankind as a whole constitutes. It is the study of the organisation of society and the laws of the evolution of the human mind which are supposed to require the use of the results of all the other sciences. Now this would be justified if Comte really contended that the aim of sociology (and that part of biology which in his system replaces individual psychology) was to explain mental phenomena in physical terms, that is, if he wanted seriously to carry out his early dreams of unification of all sciences on the basis of some single universal law.' But this he has explicitly abandoned. His rigid schematism leads him indeed to assert that none of the phenomena belonging to any of the sciences higher up in his hierarchy can ever fully be reduced to, or explained in terms of, the preceding sciences. It is just as impossible to explain sociological phenomena purely in biological terms as, in his opinion, it will remain forever impossible to reduce chemical phenomena altogether to physical. While there will always be sociological laws which cannot be reduced to mechanical or biological laws, this break between sociology and biology is no different from the presumed difference between chemistry and physics. When, however, Comte tries to prove his contention that sociology depends on a sufficient development of the other science, he fails completely, and the examples he gives as illustrations are almost childish. That in order to under- 1 Cf. C. Menger, Unztersuchungent uber die Methode der Sozialwissenschaften, Leipzig, I883, p.

Die ' Grenzen des Naturerkennens ' und die hieraus fir das theoretische Verstandnis der Naturphianomene sich ergebenden Schwierigkeiten bestehen in Wahrheit nicht fur die exakte Forschung auf dem Gebiete der Sozialerscheinungen. Wenn A. Comte die 'Gesellschaften' als reale Organismen, und zwar als Organismen komplizierterer Art, denn die naturlichen, auffasst und ihre theoretische Interpretation als das unvergleichlich kompliziertere und schwierigere wissenschaftliche Problem bezeichnet, so befindet er sich somit in einem schweren Irrtum. Seine Theorie wiare nur gegenuiber Sozialforschern richtig, welche den, mit Rucksicht auf den heutigeni Zustand der theoretischen Naturwissenschaften, geradezu wahnwitzigen Gedanken fassen wiurden, die Gesellschaftsphanomene nicht spezifisch sozialwissenschaftlich, sondern in naturwissenschaftlich atomistischer Weise interpretieren zui wollen."</page><page sequence="25">194I] THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION OF SCIENCE 305 stand any social phenomena we have to know the explanation of the change of day and night and of the changes of the seasons " by the circumstances of the earth's daily rotation and annual movements ", or that " the very conception of the stability in human association could not be positively estab- lished till the discovery of gravitation,"' is simply not true. The results of the natural sciences may be essential data for sociology to the extent to which they actually affect the action of the men who use them. But that is true, whatever the state of natural knowledge is, and there is no reason why the sociologist need know more of natural science than those whose actions he tries to explain, and therefore no reason why the development of the study of society should have to wait on the natural sciences having reached a certain stage of development. Comte claims that with the application of the positive method to social phenomena the unity of method of all sciences is established. But beyond the general characteristic of the positive method, " to abandon, as necessarily vain, all search for causes, be it primary or final, and to confine itself to the study of the invariable relations which constitute the effective laws of all observable events "&gt;2 it is difficult to say in what precisely this positive method consists. It certainly is not, as one might expect, the universal applica- tion of mathematical methods. Although mathematics is to Comte the source of the positive method, the field where it appeared first and in its purest form,3 he does not believe that it can be usefully applied in the more complicated subjects, even chemistry,4 and he is scornful about the attempts to apply statistics to biology5 or the calculus of probability to social phenomena.6 Even observation, the one common element of all sciences, does not appear in the same form in all of them. As the sciences become more com- plicated, new methods of observation become available while others appropriate to the less complicated phenomena cease to be useful. Thus, while in astronomy the mathematical method and pure observation rule, in physics and chemistry the experiment comes in as a new help. And as we proceed further, biology brings the comparative method and sociology, 1 Cours, IV, pp. 356-7, P.P.

There is one more aspect of the hierarchy of the sciences which must be briefly mentioned, as it is relevant to points which we shall presently have to consider. As we ascend the hierarchical scale of the sciences and the phenomena with which they deal become more complex, they also become more subject to modification by human action and at the same time less " perfect " and therefore more in need of improvement by human control. Comte has nothing but contempt for people who admire the " wisdom of nature ", and he is quite certain that a few competent engineers in creating an organism for a particular task would do in- finitely better.2 And the same applies necessarily to the most complicated and therefore most imperfect of all natural phenomena, human society. The paradox that the instru- ment of the human mind, which according to this theory should be the most imperfect of all phenomena, should yet at the same time have the unique power to control and improve itself, does not trouble Comte in the least. 5 There is one respect in which Comte not only admits but even stresses a difference in the method, not only of sociology, but of all organic sciences from that of inorganic sciences. And although this break occurs between chemistry and biology, the importance of this " inversion " of procedure, as Comte's calls it himself, is of even greater importance with respect to sociology and we shall quote in full the passage in which he himself explains it with direct reference to the study of social phenomena. " There exists necessarily," he explains, " a fundamental difference between the whole of inorganic philosophy and the whole of organic philosophy. In the first, where solidarity between the phenomena, as we have shown, is little pronounced, and can only little affect the study of the subject, we have to explore a system where the elements are better known than the whole, and are usually even alone directly observable. But in the second, on the contrary, where man and society constitute the principal object, the opposite procedure becomes most often the only rational one, as another consequence of the same logical I Cours, III, 40e le9on, VI, p. 671. 2 Cours, III, pp. 321-2.</page><page sequence="27">I941] THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION OF SCIENCE 307 principle, because the whole of the object is here certainly much better known and more immediately accessible."' This astounding assertion that where we have to deal with social phenomena the whole is better known than the parts is put forward as an indisputable axiom without much further explanation. It is of crucial importance for the understanding of the new science of sociology as created by Comte and accepted by his direct successors. Its signi- ficance is further enhanced by the fact that this collectivist approach is characteristic of most of the students who approach such phenomena from what we have called a scientistic " point of view.2 But it must be admitted that it is not easy to see why this should be so, and Comte gives us little help in this respect. One possible justification of this view which would occur first to the modern mind, played at best a very minor role in Comte's thought: the idea that mass phenomena may show statistical regularities while the composing elements seem to follow no recognisable law.3 This idea, made familiar by Comte's contemporary Quetelet,4 is certainly not the foundation of Comte's own argument. It is indeed more than doubtful whether Comte ever took notice of Quetelet's work beyond showing indignation about the latter's using, in the subtitle of a work dealing with " mere statistics ",5 the term " social physics ", which Comte regarded as his intellectual property. But though Quetelet seems thus to have been thus indirectly responsible for the substitution of the new word " sociology ",6 for what Comte till well on in the fourth volume of the Cours still describes as social physics ",7 his main idea, which should have fitted so well into Comte's general approach and was to play so important a r6le in later scientistic sociology, found no place in Comte's system. We shall probably have to see the explanation in Comte's general attitude of treating whatever phenomena a science had to deal with as immediately given " things " and in his desire to establish a similarity between biology, the science Cours, IV, p. 258, cf. Early Essays, p. 239. 2 This has often been noted and commented upon. See particularly E.

And since in biology it was unquestionably true that the organisms were better known to us than their parts, the same had to be asserted of sociology. 6 The exposition of Comte's sociology, which was to con- stitute the fourth volume of the Cours, extended in fact to three volumes considerably longer than the first three dealing with all the other sciences. The fourth volume, published in I839, contains mainly the general considerations on the new science and its static part. The two remaining ones contain a very full and detailed exposition of sociological dynamics, that general theory of the history of the human mind, which was the main aim of Comte's labours. The division of the subject into statics and dynamics,' which Comte believes to be appropriate to all sciences, he takes over, not directly from mechanics, but from biology, to which it had been applied by the physiologist De Blain- ville, whose work had influenced Comte to an extent equalled only by Lagrange, Fourier, and Gall.2 The distinction, which according to De Blainville in biology corresponds to that between anatomy and physiology, or organisation and life, is made to correspond in sociology with the two great watchwords of positivism, order and progress. Static sociology deals with the laws of co-existence of social pheno- mena, while dynamic sociology is concerned with the laws of succession in the necessary evolution of society. When it comes to the execution of this scheme it proves, however, that Comte has extraordinarily little to say on the static part of his subject. His disquisitions about the necessary consensus between all the parts of any social system, the idee mere of solidarity as he often calls it, which in social phenomena is even more marked than in biological, remain pretty empty generalisations, as Comte has no way (or intention) of establishing why particular institutions, or which kinds of institutions, should necessarily go together or others be incompatible. The comments on the relations between the individual, the family, and society, in the single chapter devoted to social statics, rise little above the l Cours, I, p. 29, IV, pp. 230-I. 2 The Cours is dedicated to Fourier and De Blainville, the two men among these four who were still alive at the time of its publication,</page><page sequence="29">I941] THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION OF SCIENCE 309 commonplace.l In the discussion of the division of labour, although a distant echo of Adam Smith,2 there is no trace of a comprehension of the factors which regulate it; and how little he understands them becomes evident when he expressly denies that a division of intellectual labour similar to that applying to material labour is possible.3 The whole of his statics is, however, no more than a brief sketch and of minor importance compared with the dynamic part of sociology, the fulfilment of his main ambition. It is the attempt to prove the basic contention, which Comte, as a young man of twenty-six, had expressed in a letter to a friend when he promised to show that "there were laws governing the development of the human race as definite as those determining the fall of a stone ".4 History was to be made a science, and the essence of all science is that it should be capable of prediction.5 The dynamic part of sociology was therefore to become a philosophy of history, as it is commonly but somewhat misleadingly called, or a theory of history as it would be more correctly described. The idea which was to inspire so much of the thought of the second half of the nineteenth century, was to write " abstract history", " history without the names of men or even people".6 The new science was to provide a theoretical scheme, an abstract order in which the major changes of human civilization must necessarily follow each other. The basis of this scheme is of course the law of the three stages and the main content of dynamic sociology is a detailed elaboration of the law. It is thus a curious feature of the Comtean system that this same law which is supposed 1 It may however be mentioned, since it does not seem to have been noticed before, that the distinction between Gemeinschaft and Cesellschaft, popularised by the German sociologist F. Toennies, already appears in Comte, who stresses the fact that " domestic relations do not constitute an association but a union." (Cours, IV, p. 419, P.P., II, ii6.) 2 Smith's influence appears in a clear and rather surprising form when Comte asks: "peut-on reellement concevoir, dans l'ensemble des phenomenes naturels, un plus merveilleux spectacle que cette convergence regulire et continue d'une immensite d'individus, dou6s chacun d'une existence pleinement distincte et, a un certain degre, independante, et neanmoins tous dis- poses sans cesse malgre les differences plus ou moins discordantes de leur talents et sourtout de leurs caracteres, a concourir spontanement, par une multitude de moyens divers, a un meme developpement general, sans s'etre d'ordinaire nullement concertes, et le plus souvent a l'insu de la plupart d'entre eux, qui ne croient obeir qu'a leurs impulsions personelles ?

We need not trouble here with its elaboration in detail, beyond saying that in Comte's hands human history becomes largely identified with the growth of the natural sciences.' What is relevant to us are only the general implications of the idea of a natural science which deals with the laws of intellectual development of the human race, and the practical conclusions drawn from it with regard to the future organisation of society. The idea of recognisable laws, not only of the growth of individual minds, but of the development of the knowledge of the human race as a whole, presupposes that the human mind could, so to speak, look down on itself from a higher plane and be able not merely to understand its operation from the inside, but observe it, as it were, from the outside. The curious thing about this proposition, particularly in its Comtean form, is that although it explicitly recognises that the interactions of individual minds may produce something in a sense superior to what an individual mind can ever achieve, it yet claims for the same individual mind not only the power to grasp this development as a whole and to recognise the principle on which it works and even the course it must follow, but also the power to control and direct it and thereby to improve upon its uncontrolled working. What this belief really amounts to is that the products of the process of mind can be comprehended as a whole by a simpler process than the laborious one of understanding them, and that the individual mind, looking at these results from the outside, can then directly connect these wholes by laws applying to them as entities, and finally, by extra- polating the observed development, achieve a kind of short- cut to the future development. This empirical theory of the development of the collective mind is at the same time the most naive and the most influential result of the applica- tion of the procedure of the natural sciences to social phenomena and of course based on the illusion that the phenomena of the mind are in the same sense given as objective things, and subject to external observation and control as physical phenomena. It follows from this ap- proach that our knowledge is to be regarded as " relative " and conditioned by assignable factors-not merely from the 1 Cours, 1, p. 65.</page><page sequence="31">194I] THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION OF SCIENCE 3!! point of view of some hypothetical more highly organised mind, but from our own point of view. It is from this point of view that the belief springs that we ourselves can recognise the " mutability "' of our mind and of its laws and the belief that the human race can undertake to control its own development. This idea that the human mind can, as it were, lift itself up by its own bootstraps, has remained a dominant characteristic of most sociology to the present day,2 and we have here the root (or rather one of the roots, the other being Hegel) of that modern hubris which has found its most perfect expression in the so-called " sociology of knowledge ". And the fact that this idea of the human mind controlling its own development has from its beginning been one of the leading ideas of sociology also provides the link which has always connected it with socialist ideals so that in the popular mind sociological and socialist often mean the same thing.3 It is this search for the " general laws of the continuous variations of human opinions "4 which Comte calls the " historical method ", the " indispensable complement of the positive logic ".5 But although, partly under Comte's influence, this is what the term historical method increasingly came to mean in the second half of the nineteenth century, we cannot leave this subject without pointing out that it is, of course, nearly the opposite of what historical approach really means or did mean to the great historians who in the beginning of the century tried by the application of the method to understand the genesis of social institutions. As the contrast between the two approaches which are both described as " historical method " corresponds in many ways to the general contrast between the scientistic or naturalistic approach to social phenomena and the specific methods developed by the social sciences, and as the use of the same term for two so very different views has so greatly obscured the conflict, it is, perhaps, not inappropriate if we conclude this discussion of Comte's method with a brief Cf. Cours, VI, pp. 6zo, 6zz. 2 Cf. the concluding sentences in Professor Morris Ginsberg's recent Sociology (Home University Library, 1934, p. 244): " The conception of a self-directing humanity is new and as yet vague in the extreme. To work out its full theoretical implications, and, with the aid of the other sciences, to inquire into the possibilities of its realisation, may be said to be the ultimate object of sociology." 3 This was, perhaps, even more true of the Continent, where it was generally known that the various "sociological societies" consisted almost exclusively of socialists. 4 Cours, VI, p. 670. 5 Cours, VI, p. 671.</page><page sequence="32">312 ECONOMICA [AUGUST summary of the difference. The real historical method (perhaps better described as genetic method) attempts to understand essentially unique historical situations as the result of all the circumstances which have contributed to its developments-using whatever laws of social phenomena we know in very much the same sense in which we can explain the peculiarities of an individual as the joint result of many independent factors. There is no attempt to constitute these complex situations into wholes which as such obey separate laws. The other, which is now usually meant when the " idea of evolution ", the Entwicklungsgedanke, is brought in as a sort of incantation, attempts to treat historical situations as species of a genus, as instances of the same type of fact, and it believes that these facts can be treated as phenomena of the kind, which according to the basic maxim of positivism, must all be " subject to laws ''.1 7 It is hardly surprising that, with this ambitious conception of the task of the single theoretical science of society which he admits into his system, Comte should have nothing but contempt for the already existing social disciplines. It would hardly be worth while to dwell on this attitude if it were not so characteristic of the view taken at all time of the social sciences by men blinded by the scientistic prejudice, and if his own efforts had not, at least in part, to be explained by his almost complete ignorance of the achievements of the then existing social sciences. Some, as particularly the study of language, he regards as hardly worth men- tioning.2 But he takes the trouble to denounce political economy at some length, and here his severity stands in a strange contrast to his exceedingly slender knowledge of the object of his abuse. Indeed, as even one of his admirers, who has devoted a whole book to Comte's relation to economics,3 could not help emphasizing, his knowledge of economics was practically non-existent. He knew and even admired Adam Smith, partly for his descriptive work in 1 On all these problems connected with the two kinds of " historism " see the excellent article by W. Eucken, Die Ueberwindung des Historismus, Scbmollers Jahrbuch fiur Gesetzge- bung, Verwailtung und Volkswirtschaft im Deutscheni Reiche, Vol. 63-Z, 1938. 2 The " grammarians are even more absurd than the logicians."

In his early years he had made the acquaintance of J. B. Say and some other members of the same circle, particularly Destutt de Tracy. But the latter's treatment of economics in his great treatise on " ideology between logic and morals appeared to Comte merely a frank admission of the " metaphysical" character of economics.' For the rest, the economists did not seem to Comte to be worth bothering about. He knew a priori that they had merely performed their necessary destructive role, typical repre- sentatives of the negative or revolutionary spirit which was the essence of the metaphysical phase. That no positive contribution to the reorganisation of society could be ex- pected from them was evident from the fact that they had not been trained as scientists: " being almost invariably lawyers or literary men, they had no opportunity of dis- cipline in that spirit of positive rationality which they suppose they have introduced into their researches. Precluded by their education from any idea of scientific observation of even the smallest phenomena, from any notions of natural laws, from all perception of what demonstration is, they must obviously be incapable of applying a method in which they had no practice to the most difficult of all analyses."2 Comte indeed would admit to the study of sociology only men who had successively and successfully mastered all the other sciences and thus properly prepared themselves for the most difficult task of the study of the most complex of all phenomena.3 Although the further development of the new science could not again present difficulties as great as those he had himself surmounted in first creating it,4 only the very best minds could hope successfully to grapple with them. The special difficulty of this task arises from the absolute necessity of dealing with all aspects of society at the same time, a necessity dictated by the particularly close " consensus " of all social phenomena. To have sinned against this principle and to have attempted to deal with economic phenomena in isolation, " apart from the analysis of the intellectual, moral, and political state of society ",5 is one of the main reproaches against the economists.

And he particularly condemns the tendency of political economy to " answer to all complaints that in the long run all classes, and especially the one most injured on the existing occasion, will enjoy a real and per- manent satisfaction; a reply which will be regarded as derisive, as long as man's life is incapable of being in- definitely lengthened."5 8 It cannot be too much emphasized in any discussion of Comte's philosophy that he had no use for any knowledge of which he did not see the practical use.6 And " the purpose of the establishment of social philosophy is to re-establish order in society."7 Nothing seems to him " more repugnant to the real scientific spirit, not even the theological spirit ",8 than disorder of any kind, and nothing is perhaps more characteristic of the whole of Comte's work than " the inordinate demand for ' unity' and ' systematisation ' " which J.

All knowledge being once again unified, as it has not been since the theological stage began to decay, the next task is to set up a new intellectual government where only the com- petent scientists will be allowed to decide the difficult social questions.4 Since their action will in all respects be deter- mined by the dictates of science, this will not mean arbitrary government, and " true liberty ", which is nothing else than "a rational submission to the preponderance of the laws of nature ",5 will even be increased. The detail of the social organisation which positive science will impose need not concern us here. So far as economic life is concerned, it still resembles in many respects the earlier Saint-Simonian plans, particularly in so far as the leading r6le of the bankers in guiding industrial activity is concerned.6 But he dissents from the later outright socialism of the Saint-Simonians. Private property is not to be abolished, but the rich become the " necessary deposi- taries of the public capitals . and the owning of property a social function.8 This is not the only point in which Comte's system resembles the later authoritarian socialism which we associate with Prussia rather than socialism as we used to know it. In fact in some passages this resemblance with Prussian socialism, even down to the very words used, is really amazing. Thus when he argues that in the future society the " immoral " concept of individual rights will disappear and there will be only duties,9 or that in the new society there will be no private persons but only state functionaries of various units and grades,'0 and that in ICours, I, p. 15.

The later development of all this into a new Religion of Humanity with a fully developed cult is outside our subject. Needless to say that Comte, who was so completely a stranger to the one real cult of humanity, tolerance (which he would admit only in indifferent and doubtful matters),6 was not the man to make much of that idea, which in itself does not lack a certain greatness. For the rest we cannot better summarise this last phase of Comte's thought than by the well-known epigram of Thomas Huxley, who described it as " Catholicism minus Christianity ". 9 Before we cast a glance on the direct influence of Comte's main work we must briefly consider certain simultaneous and in a sense parallel efforts which, from the same intel- lectual background, but by a different route, produced an impression which tended to strengthen the tendencies of which Comte's work is the main representative. The Belgian astronomer and statistician Quetelet, who must be mentioned here in the first place, differs from Comte not only by being a great scientist in his own field but also by the great contributions which he has made to the methods of social study. He did this precisely by that application of mathe- matics to social study which Comte condemned. Through his application of the " Gaussian " normal curve of error to the analysis of statistical data he became, more than any other sinzle person, the founder of modern statistics I Cours, VI, p. 484- 2 Cours, IV, p. 437, P.P., II, p.

The value of this achievement is undisputed and indisputable. But in the general atmosphere in which Quetelet's work became known the belief was bound to arise that the statistical methods, which he had so successfully applied to some problems of social life, were destined to become the sole method of study. And Quetelet himself contributed not a little to create that belief. The intellectual environment out of which Quetelet arose' is exactly the same as that of Comte: it was the French mathematicians of the circle of the Ecole polytechnique,2 above all Laplace and Fourier, from whom he drew the inspiration for the application of the theory of probability to the problems of social statistics, and in most respects he, much more than Comte, must be regarded as the true continuer of their work and of that of Condorcet. His statistical work proper is not our concern. It was the general effect of his demonstration that something like the methods of the natural sciences could be applied to certain social problems and of his implied and even explicit demand that all problems of social science should be treated in a similar fashion, which operated in a direction parallel to Comte's teaching. Nothing fascinated the ensuing generation so much as Quetelet's " average man " and his celebrated conclusion of his studies of moral statistics that " we pass from one year to another with the sad perspective of seeing the same crimes reproduced in the same order and calling down the same punishments in the same proportions. Sad condition of humanity ! . . . We might enumerate in ad- vance how many individuals will stain their hands in the blood of their fellows, how many will be forgers, how many will be poisoners, almost we can enumerate in advance how many births and deaths there should occur. There is a budget which we pay with a frightful regularity; it is that Df prisons, chains and the scaffold."3 His views on the application of the mathematical methods have become nore characteristic of later positivist method than anything deriving directly from Comte: "The more advanced the sciences have become, the more they have tended to enter the domain of mathematics, which is a sort of centre towards which they converge. We can iudae of the perfection to 1 The fullest account of Quetelet's life and work is that by J. Lottin, Quetelet, Statisticien et Sociologue, Louvain-Paris, 19I2. 2 On the reputed influence of the Saint-Simonians on Quetelet compare above, p. 147. 3 The English translation of the above passage is taken from H.

Although Comte had condemned this view and particularly all attempts to find social laws by means of statistics, his and Quetelet's general endeavours to find natural laws of the development of the human race as a whole, to extend the Laplacean conception of universal determinism to cultural phenomena, and to make mass phenomena the sole object of the science of society were sufficiently akin to lead to a gradual fusion of their doctrines. In the same category of contemporary efforts with similar methodological tendencies we must at least briefly mention the work of F. Le Play, polytechnician and ex-Saint-Simonian, whose descriptive social surveys became the model of much later sociological work. Though differing from Comte as well as Quetelet in more respects than they have in common, he contributed like them to the reaction against theoretical individualism, classical economics, and political liberalism, thus strengthening the particular effects of the scientistic influences with which we are here concerned.2 I0 The tracing of influences is the most treacherous ground in the history of thought and we have in the last chapter already so much sinned against the elementary canons of caution in this field that we shall now be brief. Yet the curious course which Comte's influence took is so important for the understanding of the intellectual history of the nineteenth century, and of still prevailing misconceptions about his r6le, that a few more words about it are indis- spensable. In France, as already observed, Comte's imme- diate influence on thinkers of importance was small. But, as J. S. Mill points out, "the great treatise of M. Comte was scarcely mentioned in French literature or criticism, when it was already working powerfully on the minds of many British students and thinkers."3 It was this influence on Mill himself and a few other leading English thinkers which became decisive for Comte's effect on European thought. Mill himself, in the sixth book of his Logic, which deals with the methods of the moral sciences, became little more than an expounder of Comtean doctrine.

And nothing could be more characteristic of the tremendous impact of Comte on Eng- land than that the same Miss Martineau who in her younger years had been the faithful and most successful populariser of Ricardo's doctrines, should'become, not only the translator and most skilful condenser of Comte's work, but also one of its most enthusiastic disciples. As important almost as Mill himself for the spreading of positivist views among students of social phenomena was their adoption by the historian H. T. Buckle, although in this case the influence of Comte was reinforced and perhaps outweighed by that of Quetelet. It was largely through the medium of these English writers that Comtean positivism made its entry into Ger- many.' Mill's Logic, Buckle's and Lecky's historical works, and later Herbert Spencer, made Comte's ideas familiar to many who were often completely unaware of their source. And although it is perhaps doubtful whether many of the German scholars who in the second half of the-nineteenth century professed views closely similar to Comte's, had derived them directly from him, there were probably in no other country a greater number of influential men who tried to reform the social sciences on essentially Comtean lines. No other country seems at that time to have been more receptive of new ideas, and positivist thought together with Quetelet's new statistical methods was definitely the fashion of the period and was accepted in Germany with corres- ponding enthusiasm.2 The curious phenomenon that there (and elsewhere) positivist influences should have so readily I This penetration of Comtean positivism into Germany through the medium of English authors is a curious reversal of the earlier process when English seventeenth and eighteenth century thought had become known to Germany largely through the instrumentality of French writers, from Montesquieu and Rousseau down to J. B. Say. This fact explains to a large extent the belief, widely held in Germany, that there exists a fundamental contrast between "Western " naturalist and German idealist thought. In fact, if such a contrast can at all be drawn, there is a much more continuous difference between English thought, as represented, say, by Locke, Mandeville, Hume, Smith, Burke, Bentham and the classical economists and, on the other hand, Continental thought as represented by the two parallel and very similar developments which went from Montesquieu, through Turgot, Condorcet, down to Saint-Simon and Comte, and from Herder through Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel down to the later Hegelians. The French school of thought which indeed was closely related to English thought, that of Condillac and the " ideologues ", had disappeared by the time with which we are now concerned. 2 The infiltration of positivist thought into the social sciences in Germany is a story by itself which cannot be told here. Among its most influential representatives were the two founders of VJlkerpsychologie, M. Lazarus and H. Steinthal (the former important because of his influence on W. Diltlhey), E. du Bois-Reymond (see particularly his lecture Kslsturgescbichite und Naturwissenscbaft, 1877), the Viennese circle of T. Gosliperz and WV. Scherer, later W. Wundt, H. Vaihinger, W. Oswalt and K. Lamprecht. See on this iE. Rothacker, Einleitzrnsg in die Geisteswissenscbaften, Tiibingen, I92o, pp. 200-206, -253 et seq., C. Misch, Derjunge Dilibey, Leipzig, 1933, E.

We have no space here more than briefly to mention the successors which at last in France took up the Comtean tradition. Before we mention the sociologists proper we must at least mention the names of Taine and Renan, both, incidentally, representatives of that curious combination of Comtean and Hegelian thought to which we have just referred. Of the sociologists almost all the best-known ones (with the exception of Tarde), Espinas, Levy-Bruhl, Durck- heim, Simiand, stand directly in the Comtean tradition, although in their case, too, this has in part come back to France via Germany and with the modifications which it there experienced.' To attempt to trace this later influence of Comte on French thought during the Third Republic would mean to write a history of sociology in the country where for a time it gained the greatest influence. Many of the best minds who devoted themselves to social studies were here attracted by the new science and it is perhaps not too much to suggest that the peculiar stagnation of French economics during that period is at least partly due to the predominance of the sociological approach to social phenomena.2 That Comte's direct influence remained confined to com- paratively few, but that through these very few it extended exceedingly far, is even more true of the present generation than it was of earlier ones. There will be few students of the social sciences now who have ever read Comte or know much about him. But the number of those who have absorbed most of the important elements of his system through the intermediation of a few very influential repre- sentatives of his tradition, such as T. Veblen3 in America, L. T. Hobhouse4 in this country, or K. Lamprecht5 in Germany, is very large indeed.
