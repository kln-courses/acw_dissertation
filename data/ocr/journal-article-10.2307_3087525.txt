<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRANSLATING SUFISM BARBARA R. VON SCHLEGELL UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA Michael Sells' Early Islamic Mysticism is a significant departure from previous translation projects. Some comments are in order about the quality of the selections and translations in Sells' book. There are two challenging features of the book: the translator's rendering of Sufi significat- ions of God and the language he chooses for interpreting Sufi expressions concerning union or unity with God. RECENT TRANSLATIONS OF SUFI WORKS ISLAMIC MYSTICISM, OR SUFISM (Arabic tasawwuf), from the ninth century A.D. until the last two hundred years, was the one cultural and intellectual constant that bound together elite and common Muslims throughout the Islamic world. With the curious exception of the Twelver ShI'C Safavid empire, controversies about cer- tain Sufi doctrines and practices never put a halt to its attraction for scholars and state officials. Far from being an alternative to "mainstream Islam," or an escape from it, it was elaborated in vocabulary and institutions as an inherent part of Islam, by scholars who became special- ists in the Islamic "science" ('ilm) of Sufism. For almost a century of scholarship now, however, Sufism has been treated in Western literature as being contested continu- ally by Islam and, in part because Sufis are viewed as being at odds with legalistic, orthodox Muslims, they are favored accordingly by many writers, who perhaps find comfort in their presence as fellow outsiders.' But the growing number of popular Sufi works in English often pasteurized versions of venerable orientalist trans- lations of original Sufi words-miss altogether the ines- This is a review article of: Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur'an, Mi'raj, Poetic and Theological Writings.

A "Neo-Sufi" thesis proposes that eighteenth-century Sufis shifted their doctrines and practices from union with God to union with the figure of Muhammad. Yet whatever other criticisms of Neo-Sufism there are to be made, the im- plication that Muhammad is not important as a Sufi model and mystical being in early Sufism is especially questionable.3 It is a great accomplishment of Sells' Early Islamic Mysticism that it makes the Islamic and 2 Having the music critic of the New York Times write a review of the visiting Turkish sama' probably was not one of Mevlana's goals nor is it likely he would recognize his writing in the form of "A Gift of Love: Deepak and Friends [Madonna, Demi Moore, Martin Sheen, Debra Winger, Goldie Hawn and others] Present Music Inspired by the Love Poems of RUm!"

The present reviewer discusses the issue with regard to Syrian Sufis of the eighteenth century in "Sufism in the Ottoman-Arab World: 'Abd al-Ghan! al-Nabulus! (d. 1731)" (Ph.D. diss., University of California, Berkeley, 1997).

In his introduction to Early Islamic Mysticism, Sells divides early Sufi phenomena into four periods. The book is concerned primarily with the first three: 1) the Qur- 'an and pre-Sufi spirituality, seventh to eighth centuries; 2) the emergence of Sufism and the time of the early masters, eighth to tenth centuries; and 3) the formative period of Sufi literature, tenth to eleventh centuries. Other recent academic writings have worked to cor- rect the view of Sufism as "counter-" [to legalistic] "culture." At the same time, as the work under review shows, efforts to de-mystify Sufism, and to portray it at work as but one among many social forces in Islamic history would be going too far in another direction. It would divert attention away from the truly surprising and creative thought of the early Sufis. An impressive number of book-length translations of Sufi literature from Sells' final period-4) the age of 'Attar, RUmi, and Ibn 'Arabi, eleventh to thirteenth cen- turies-have been done in the last decade or so and should be mentioned here. Among the books now avail- able in English are many popular and scholarly transla- tions of RUmi (including W. Thackston's new translation of The Discourses and, most recently, F Lewis' study with translations, Riimi: Past and Present, East and West) along with several fine translations of selections and entire works of Ibn 'Arabi (by W. Chittick, J. Mor- ris, G. Elmore, and others). RUmI and Ibn 'Arabi are the best-known Sufis in this period, but translations of many other tenth to thirteenth-century Sufis have been done. In addition to the "greats" from the early periods translated by Sells in the book under review, there are translations available now of al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (d. ca. 932 A.D.),4 Ibn Sina (d. 1037) as mystical thinker,5 and of AbU Sacid b. Abi Khayr's (d. 1049) teachings.6 Fresh translations of al-Ghazali (d. 1111), as well as some newly rendered into English, are enriching the study of Sufism.7 A near contemporary of al-Ghazall, 4 B.

Holland, including the Fath al- rabblni and the Ghunyah li-talib tariq al-IHaqq, while the Cambridge Islamic Texts Society has published To- sun Bayrak's translation of al-Jilani's Sirr al-asrir in 1992.9 Whereas most writers in the past tended to re- move Sufis from mainstream Islam, al-Jilani, a magnet of hagiography and eponym of turuq branches down to modern times, had his Sufi credentials severely criti- cized in a scholarly publication. Based on the fact that twelfth-century biographers describe al-Jilani as afaqih, and not in explicitly Sufi terms, J. Chabbi claimed that al-Jilani's reputation as a mystic was invented, and is late.10 She did not question the authenticity of his pub- lished Arabic writings, however. Although they are not "visionary recitals," al-Jilani's works, as is clear from the English translations, definitely belong to tasawwuf Four new translations expand the English Sufi library of the illuminationist thought of Shihab al-Din Yahya Suhrawardi "al-Maqtuil" (d. 1191).

The same can be said of works of translation published by The Islamic Texts Society and Fons Vitae. 10 J.

Cornell of the work of Abi! Madyan (d. 1198), the North African shaykh whose name has usually ap- peared solely as a footnote in analyses of Ibn 'Arabi's career.'3 And finally, as one more in this wealth of En- glish books by Sufis from the era before Rimi, C. Ernst has translated the extraordinary diary of Riizbihan Baqli (d. 1209).14 Current scholarship and serious contributions by translators have made early Sufism considerably more accessible than it had been before.'5 Still, for the three very early periods, Sells' book and a briefer offering by C. Ernst are the only new anthologies of Sufi writings since M. Smith, R. Nicholson, and A. J.

Ernst's Teachings of Sufism (Boston: Shambhala, 1999) includes translations of extracts from later Sufi works, some by lesser-known writers, as well as a few well-chosen women authors. his book Desert Tracings: Six Classical Arabian Odes (1989). In a number of articles and chapters for edited volumes, and especially in his monograph Mystical Lan- guages of Unsaying (1994), Sells, in an engagement with comparative religionists, has contributed his per- spectives on Arabic mystical texts. As one example, the first truly fresh translation of the last juz' (thirtieth por- tion) of the Qur'an since A. J. Arberry was published by Sells in 1999 (Approaching the Qur'dn). More recently, Sells issued his Stations of Desire: Love Elegies from Ibn 'Arabi and New Poems (2000) and has co-edited The Literature of Al-Andalus. 17 Early Islamic Mysticism Since publication in 1996, it has stood successfully the test of college and university classrooms. It contains passages that are translated with aching beauty and clar- ity. Sells' translations of pre-Islamic poetry, some of which reappear here, are well known. In Early Islamic Mysticism (hereafter EIM) he also tackles prose with equal ingenuity. A few illustrations: Jacfar al-Sadiq is quoted in reference to the Qur'anic verses about Mu- hammad's encounter with God during the Mi'raj, "When the lover draws as near to his beloved as is possible, he is overcome by utter terror. Then the truth treats him with complete gentleness because nothing but complete gentleness can endure utter terror" (p. 84). Bistami calls out to God, "You have created your creation without their knowledge and have adorned them with faith with- out their will. If you don't help them, who will?" (p. 238). MuhasibI describes the arrogance that comes with con- ceit as "a particular anxiety a person has that he not be lorded over, along with a love of lording it over others" (p. 189). On the subject of "the moment," Qushayri's master al-Daqqaq recites: Just as the people of fire when their skin is well roasted have prepared for their wretchedness new skin No one truly dies who finds rest in dying To truly die is to live your death (p. 101). For those who remember God after sinning, the Qur'an promises, in Sells' translation: 17 Edited with Maria Rosa Menocal and Raymond P. Scheind- lin (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2000). Sells also wrote the chapter entitled "Love" in the volume.</page><page sequence="4">VON SCHLEGELL: Translating Sufism 581 For them is a reward offorgiveness from their lord and gardens with rivers flowing underneath eternal there fine is the recompense for those whose deeds are fine (3:136, p. 86). Sells has provided introductory sections to all of the chapters which, taken together, would stand alone as an excellent guide to early Sufism, for both academic and general readers.18 Among the benefits of the book is the emphasis on the importance, in the selections and in Sells' comments, of the Prophet Muhammad, not only for Sufi journeys that imitate his Mi'raj, but as the per- fect model for the mystical life. The hadith "My heart becomes shrouded, so that I ask God Most High for pardon seventy times a day" means, for instance, that Muhammad's normal human consciousness is a veil from reality that glimmers ever more strongly as he rises from one state to another, not that he, too, is prone to human error and needs God's forgiveness (pp. 104-5). Muham- mad's personality is compared in the Qur'an, hadith and related literature, and no less so in Sufi texts, with Moses. We have always known from Islamic texts who will win the prophetic competition as delivering divine law most effectively, and the theme has been discussed elsewhere, but this is the first English book on Sufism I am aware of that makes clear that the issue of Muham- mad's elevation over or beyond Moses (Islam over Juda- ism) is a Sufi preoccupation (see, e.g., pp. 96 and 136).19 18 The popularity of Sufism for the classroom and for gen- eral readers has spawned a number of new introductory texts that can be considered in addition to the older, and still excel- lent, books by A. J. Arberry, T. Burckhardt, M. Lings, J. S. Trimingham, and A. Schimmel. W. Chittick offers an overview of Sufi beliefs in his Sufism: A Short Introduction (Oxford: Oneworld Publishers, 2000); A. Knysh provides a different approach in his Islamic Mysticism: A Short History (Leiden: Brill, 2000); M. Sedgwick has recently published Sufism: The Essentials (Cairo: American Univ. in Cairo Press, 2001, not seen); and C. Ernst's Shambhala Guide to Sufism (Boston: Shambhala, 1997), while thoroughly researched, offers under- graduates the most readable introduction to the subject on the market. One wishes that Sells would add an introductory text- book to Sufism to his list of writings. 19 Moses stands for the limitations of Law and rational thought when they stand alone without spiritual tempering, as in the story of Khidr and Moses in a Sufi telling. Jesus, be- cause of his miraculous origin directly from the divine rah, has a different character in Sufi writings. Christianity, not the per- son of Christ, is "faulted." Sells provides a fine Qur'anic trans- The translations start with passages from the Qur'an (including short sarahs to which Sells gives English sounds approximating the power of the Arabic Meccan chapters), Sah!h Muslim, and Sirat Ibn Hisham. As back- ground for the language and imagery of Sufi writings, Sells then offers examples from pre-Islamic poetry. No scholar before Sells has brought out in a meaningful way the traces of this body of Arabic literature on the Sufi tradition. The unattainable beloved, her stopping places, and pilgrimage sites, all become basic elements of Sufi writing about spiritual states and stations, as Sells proves with the selections that follow. Two sec- tions on Sufi tafsir, one from that ascribed to Jacfar al- S5diq, the other from TustarI, precede Qushayri's defini- tions of technical terms. For the QushayrI chapter, Sells translates the entire alfaz (technical terms) portion of the Risalah. The translation is crisp throughout; this is one of the best parts of the book. One is especially grateful for the points in this section, and elsewhere in EIM, where Sells proves wrong the prevailing depic- tions of Sufism in which Junayd appears as a spoilsport figure, limited in mystical perception, who chooses so- briety over ecstasy. Chapters four through ten consist of individual Sufi figures, their teachings, and accounts of their spiritual lives. 'Attar's telling of Rabi'ah's life, skillfully trans- lated from the Persian by Paul Losensky with an intro- duction and notes by Sells, is in sharp contrast to Qushayri's chapter of technical terms that precedes it. Onions and tears, Sufi men and women jousting, these are good stories for student enjoyment. (We are refer- red to Baldick's scholarly article for Rabi'ah's historical and hagiographical personage.) Muhdsibl's "Moral Psy- chology" is followed by a flawless translation of the maqiimat of Sarraj. Sarraj also provides the commentary for the shathiyat that make up the first part of the next chapter, on Abi Yazid al-Bistami. Abi! Yazid's sayings are translated further from Sulam! and Qushayri, along with the account of his Mi'raj from al-Qasd ila Allah. Here I wish that Sells' rich material in the footnotes on mystical ascent had been given more space in the chap- ter's main introductory text. A selection from Junayd's writings about unity and fanaP that form the next chap- ter brings Sells to admit "This is not a comfortable piece to read or to translate" (p. 259). By not bridging over difficulties in the Arabic with added English terms, he has succeeded overall and has honored the original more lation of the story of the Virgin Mary and Jesus but, as material for speaking about the Sufi path, Moses receives more attention in the texts and in EIM.</page><page sequence="5">Journal of the American Oriental Society 122.3 (2002) than Abdel-Kader's earlier translations. From the small number of available texts attached to the name of HIallaj, Sells chooses, for the next chapter, to translate the TaSin on Iblis. Does Hallaj portray Satan as a true or short- sighted monotheist? This and other questions, such as free will and determinism, raised in bold style, make the chapter fruitful for student discussions in classes on Is- lam and Sufism. The final chapter is from the Mawiiqif of al-Niffari. Conversations between God and mystics have a long and continuing tradition in Sufi writings. They understand- ably cause consternation among non-Sufis; when the speakers' identities disappear, as they do throughout NiffarlI, today's Salafis throw up their hands. Placing this section at the end of the book reminds us that advice about asceticism, love of God, and the systematization of Sufi practice, are only a part of the discourse of Islamic mysticism before the end of the tenth century. Like Junayd's radical understanding of tawhid, but in elliptical reference to experience at the interstices of human and divine reality, NiffarI presages what is to become full- blown with Ibn 'ArabI, which is Sells' subject in many of his other scholarly works. The short poem given as an epilogue comes from the Hallajian Diw&amp;M. As an ap- pendix, Sells offers a translation from Shahrastanil on different schools of kalim. But, without elaborate cross- references from the doctrinal points in Shahrastani to the earlier Sufi portions, students, in my experience, have found the section distracting rather than illuminating. Most of the selections in the book have never been translated into English, although French and German renderings exist for some of them. Where available, Sells has provided thorough references to the original ed- ited texts and their translations. There are a few excep- tions. Page numbers to Nwyia's text of the tafsir attributed to Jacfar al-Sddiq are missing from the foot- notes to "Early Sufi Qur an Interpretations."20 G. Bow- ering's edition of Sulami's Ziyiidat haqi'iq al-tafsir receives no note within the same chapter; its publication date of 1995 might have overlapped this book's prepara- tion. A 1984 translation of Shahrastani (Muslim Sects and Divisions by T G. Flynn and A. K. Kazi)-though it has been criticized for its lack of critical apparatus- is not mentioned. God Language Among the difficulties of the translations, God lan- guage and gender stand out. Alhlh is "God," but some- 20 There are also no page numbers to Qazvlni's and Is- ti'laim's editions of 'Attdr used for the chapter on Rdbi'ah. times "Allah," and the pronoun is "he." Rabb is "lord." Elsewhere Sells has written that the divine name al- .Haqq "has no innate status as a proper noun but can bor- row such status from context."21 In EIM the name is translated as "the real." To avoid always using a mascu- line pronoun and capital letters for the divine being, Sells uses "it" and "he" when the antecedent is "the real" even though he has capitalized the optatives that follow all divine referents in the originals. Capitalizing pronouns for God has never been uniform in English translations of the Bible or in Christian writings, and I suppose there is no imperative for them in Islamic En- glish. However at times the result of Sells' creative work with capitalization and pronouns is less than satisfac- tory, as in QushayrI's definition of sharicah "divine law is that you worship it [God]" (p. 141), or in Rabi'ah's chapter when she says that "love of the real (mahabbat- i haqq) has so pervaded me that there is no place in my heart for love or hatred of another" (p. 163). Is it true to the sources that, on the one hand, Allah be "demoted" to the level of personal deity who creates, who speaks through the Qur'an, and who is worshipped while, on the other, al-lHaqq becomes the sole term for the abstract Absolute (pp. 7-8)? The terms khalq/laqq are often paired in Sufi texts. Precisely because they imply "the created worshipper (khalq)/the creator of the worshippers (haqq)," haqq is nearest to what Western theologians call a "personal God." In addition, it is not uncommon to encounter Alldh as the Absolute, the name that contains all possibilities. However, after re-reading many passages, I changed my mind. It seems that al- .Haqq, indeed, is fittingly translated in most places in early Sufi texts as "the Real" in accord with the English sense of "Ultimate Reality."22 But at other times it surely is simply "the truth," as in Sells' translation of Niffari: "I said: You, God, there is no God but You. He said: You have spoken the real" (p. 298). One might also ask, does the tailoring of the Arabic huwa, usually translated as "He/he" when referring to 21 "Comments" section of M. Idel and B. McGinn, eds., Mystical Union and Monotheistic Faith: An Ecumenical Dia- logue (New York: Macmillan, 1989), 165. 22 With some other notable exceptions. See, e.g., Qushayri's use of al-IHaqq in the following, "The real, Most Worthy of Praise and Most High, has given their heart sustenance in every instant, as he said (19:62).. .." p. 133; the translator comments on p. 7 that it is Allah who is "the personal deity that speaks through the Qur'an." The tafsir portion on p. 81 exhibits similar problems. In any case, my personal preference would be in favor of capitalizing the translation of al-IHaqq as the Real.</page><page sequence="6">VON SCHLEGELL: Translating Sufism 583 God, to "it" (or "She/she," for that matter) reflect the intended meaning of the original authors of religious texts? In a footnote to the first chapter, "Sources of Islamic Mysticism," Sells explains he is not in favor of "imposing feminine constructions, but ... breaking with the tradition-which has no Qur'anic or linguistic justification-of repressing them" (p. 325, see also com- ments p. 38). This applies not strictly to pronouns refer- ring to God but to all gendered referents. For example, SUrat al-Infitar, v. 5, is given as, "Then a person will know what she has given and what she has held back," and SUrat al-Zalzalah begins, "When the earth is shaken, quaking / And she yields up her burdens" (pp. 44-45). But for God in EIM, Sells stays with "he" or "it." Of course Muslims do not speak of whether God is male or female, as this trespasses on strict notions of tawhid. Unlike Judaism and especially Christianity, there is no imagery of a father God to warrant using solely masculine pronouns. There is even a fair amount of God- as-nurturing-mother imagery in Sufi writings. Western feminists who write about religion are concerned about the social construction of gender and the way it deter- mines how we speak of the divine. Most Muslims find such ideas offensive or just silly, as "the way things are" is thought to take the opposite direction, heaven downwards, so to speak. Persian, with its gender neutral pronouns, is the ideal language for resolving gender problems in speaking of God; Arabic, up until now, has demanded using the masculine as the default pronoun for God. Still, Muslims are serious about God being be- yond gender.23 With practice, Sells' "it" might serve quite well, but because of the deeply embedded prac- tice of relating to God in a gendered way in English (whether by the traditional masculine form or with the new blends), I have my doubts. 23 This is not to say that privileging of the male gender on earth or in heaven is not present in the Qur'dn. See 17:40 and esp. 53:19. Sells does not use the feminine pronoun for God in EIM, unless one counts the female beloved of the Arabic po- etry cited or written by the Sufis he translates. Some would say that since the feminine pronoun has no history of being used for both sexes or as neuter in English, using it for God is par- ticularly limiting and an act of anthropomorphism in the true sense (if not etymology) of the word. For many years, Michael Sells has worked on language and gender in the Qur'Zn and theology. See, e.g., "Sound, Spirit, and Gender in Slirat al- Qadr," JAOS 111 (1991): 239-60 and "Towards a Poetic Trans- lation of the Fusas al-Hikam," in Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi: A Commemorative Volume, ed. S. Hirtenstein and M. Tiernan (Rockport, Mass.: Element Books, 1993), 124-39. Union with God Another controversial feature of the book reflects an equally important issue in Sufi theology, and in polem- ics against Sufism. This is the question of union with God. Problems in teaching Sufism as part of Islam in the academy are many. How many of us, after giving what we thought were fairly thorough introductions to the history of Islamic mysticism and its practitioners, have read the following in student exams; "The goal of Sufism is union with God"? Comparative scholars of re- ligion often expect Sufis to act like proper mystics and seek unio mystica. But the texts translated in EIM are ambiguous on the matter. It can be misleading to read the English word "union" when the original sources employ Arabic terms that, in my opinion, imply something other than what is asso- ciated with that word when it is used today. No matter whether it is a matter of perception (what seems to us to be union is actually God's overtaking the human), or choice of expression (metaphorical union is used be- cause it is safe, whereas spelling it out is dangerous), the original texts behind EIM do not use the word ittihad, which would be the strict Arabic equivalent for "union." On p. 141, Qushayri, who comes in the generation set to defend the early Sufi masters, declares, in Sells' trans- lation, "No created being attains union with [God]" (wa mai ittasala bihi makhliiq). But a similar expression is translated elsewhere not as attaining union but as "clinging to [God]" (al-ittisal bihi, p. 254). In this case the translation implies that the seeker's identity is main- tained. In one of the pilgrimage stories about Rabi'ah, she is warned that she would melt if God were to mani- fest himself to her. Instead she asks only for "a drop of poverty" (p. 158). Even this is said to be far from her grasp, and she eventually returns to Basra because, as the divine voice explains in a way that would seem to break any pilgrim's heart, "When [they] near that clod of earth (the Ka'bah), they themselves cause the road to be closed to them" (p. 159). As a part of this exchange she is shown a sea of blood, "the blood of our lovers who came seeking union with us" (keh bi-talab-i wyiil-i mii).24 It can be argued that ittisil and wisil in these examples are simply chosen as code for more problematic Arabic words for mystical union; it can also be said that they are used because they convey a different reality or degree of intimacy, perhaps closer to the (admittedly less poetic) notion of "arriving at God." 24 P. 158 of EIM, p. 69 of Qazvini's edition of the Tadhkirah (Tehran: Kitabkhanah-'i Markazi, 1957).</page><page sequence="7">584 Journal of the American Oriental Society 122.3 (2002) One more Arabic word that appears in the texts of EIM seems undeniably an equivalent of "union" and that is jam'. In Qushayri's definitions of Sufi technical terms in pairs, jam' and farq are translated as "union and separation." Here the word fits, although it might also be possible to think of "integratedness and dissolu- tion." Qushayr! explains that, from the human plane, 'union of union (jam' al-jam') is the utter perishing and passing away of all perception of any other-than-God" (p. 118, emphasis added). Muslim theology is of course strongly against the idea of God becoming human (Hillfl, i.e., substantial union and the attendant connection with the incarnation of Christ) or human becoming god.25 This does not mean, as has been asserted by various writers, that Muslims see God as not being present in history, collective and individual. As the majority of Muslims (and Jews) would say, I believe, one doesn't have to unite with God or have faith in incarnation to have a close personal rela- tionship with God. Or, to put it differently, because one does not desire literal union with God (because one be- lieves it is impossible ontologically) does not mean that one is trapped in isolation from the divine source. Now it should be said that even Bernard McGinn ac- knowledges that the term "union" only gained currency in this sense when it became a tool of scholars of Chris- tian mysticism and religious studies in the nineteenth century.26 Sells uses union language for what he terms "the apophatic mystics" of Islam, because that is what he finds behind the terms fandi/baqid in the early Sufi writers and especially in the school of Ibn 'Arab!. While he translates words with the root w-s-l and others as 'union" here, Sells states in a footnote only one of the most significant correctives to previous treatments of Sufism: "In Sufi understanding of mystical union, there is no 'meeting of two parties,' but rather one party disap- pears and the other emerges" (p. 341 n. 77; clearly dem- onstrated in Bistami's words on p. 216). It would seem, then, that there might be alternative ways in English to express the concept of "union." The English word "union" should be reserved for ittihdd, the literal joining of two things into one. If one is a Sufi writing in Arabic, ittihad is, of course, the word to avoid because al-ittihadiyan is the label that later anti-Sufis love to use for their worst enemies. But I don't think it is only because of outsiders' criticism that it is not used. 25 The only allusion to "incarnationism" occurs in verses attributed by Sarraj to Bistdmr and by others to Halldj, p. 218. 26 Mystical Union and Monotheistic Faith, 185. One senses that there is virtually always the preserva- tion of something transcendent, even when the Sufi re- alizes unity. Especially central to Sufi self-definition is the oft-cited hadith al-nawafil of Bukharl, "When my servant draws near to me . .. I become the hearing with which he hears.. ." (p. 22). Junayd, Sarraj, Qushayri, and Sulam! writing on AbU Yazid all refer to it, as given in the selections or in notes of the book (pp. 226, 234, 261, 338). Rather than calling this "the union hadith" (p. 342), it would be more in keeping with the way it is used-to express an intensity of yearning for God through acts of worship that God promises to answer in a profound way-to stay with Sells' alternate "free de- votions hadith" (p. 217). On the other hand, especially because he did not confine himself to the most controversial figures, the ones whose goals are supposed to have been union with God, Sells' choice of translated selections is to be com- mended.27 For example, Muhasibi, whose prose and life contain none of the union language students expect from Sufis, reminds us of the more commonly expressed, if mundane, goals of tasawwuf Certainly, ecstatic union with God was not in the mind of the person who is cited often by Sufis as defining life as "Five prayers a day and waiting for death." Examining motivations for wor- ship, rather than blindly carrying them out, sets the Sufi approach apart from non-Sufi Islam. In devotional writ- ings, this topic does not make as absorbing reading as becoming one with the divine, but it is probably more representative. On the other hand, while Sells is admir- ing of Muhasibi's insights (for instance, into procrastina- tion), he cites with approval Massignon's judgment that Muhasibi sullies his "sophisticated psychology with the most naive devotional perspectives . .. Death is to be feared not on its own account, but rather for the 'ac- counting' that it entails" (p. 179). For Massignon to chide Muhasibi, or other early Sufis, for speaking of the Qur- Danic eschatological consequences of spiritual life on earth belies a prejudice against the revelation-centered con- sciousness of Islam. Contemplating death is for Sufism a spiritual discipline that is supposed to lead to a better life on earth and in eternity. In our modern psychological terms, crisis can lead to psychological change. We tend to read it all as psychological torment and attempts at transformation; in Muhasibi's inner world, this is real. Satan is pitted against God's desire for sincere worship. 27 Although he does mention AbM Tdlib al-Makki's Qiit al-quliib, I would like to have seen Sells use his translation artistry on this author, whose approach is highly unusual.</page><page sequence="8">VON SCHLEGELL: Translating Sufism 585 Specific Comments on EIM Among the refreshing neologisms Sells invents is "godfriend" (or "Godfriend") and "friend-of-God" for wali (wilayah is rendered "godfriendship"), "godser- vant" for 'abd, and "powerlust" for ridisah. Other pleas- ing translations come to mind: the way the beloved woman Mayya in a pre-Islamic poem appears facing away from the gaze of her lover, "with buttocks like a soft dune / over which a rain shower falls" (p. 73, surely the first poetic description of cellulite in history); "slinking whisperer" for Satan, al-waswds; and the no- tion of "finding" combined with ecstasy for wajd (esp. p. 221). More problematic is the case of Muhammad, who, when referred to in the originals as rasid Allah, is called, for reasons that are not clear, differently in dif- ferent passages, "Envoy of God," "Messenger," "Rasul Allah" (p. 55, three variations on one page, p. 218), and "the God-sent" (p. 240). Certain translations of thorny Arabic words remain less than satisfactory. Al-Akhirah is given as "the finality." I trust this is not a quibble; from a living, believing Muslim's point of view, the rea- son al-Akhirah is translated as "the hereafter" is that it is not the end, but the beginning of something else. Con- sistently Sells renders irddah-whether by human or divine subject-as "will." Thus, for example, al-iradah lillih in Muhasibi's Arabic is translated as one's "will for God" (p. 184). Sells introduces Hallaj's dialogue be- tween Moses and Iblis by explaining that Hallaj char- acterizes God's command (amr) to Satan to bow to Adam as a test, while God's will (iradah) was otherwise (p. 275). To my mind this turns into steel the sense of "desire" inherent in the word iradah. I am not entirely convinced that the Mi'raj angels' command to Bistami-"Come!"-is meant as a play on the optative ta'cila for God (pp. 246-47 and note pp. 358-59). In the Junayd chapter I wonder why Sells chose all past tense for the kana passages in Junayd's ex- planation of the effects of achieving ma'rifat al-tawhid on a person. For fa-kiina haythu lam yakun wa lam yakun haythu k1n. thumma kina bacd ma lam yakun haythu kana kiin. fa-huwa huwa bacd ma lam yakun huwa, we read, "He was whereby he was not and he was not whereby he was. Then he was, after he was not, whereby he was-was! He was he after he was not-he" (p. 254). Like the Qur'anic descriptions of God (e.g., in- nahu kana tawwab "[Ask God for forgiveness] for he is most forgiving" 110:3), the first elements seem better as "eternal present" tense. In the kalam appendix, it might have helped clear up confusion for readers who have not heard the point made to explain that the term Qadariyah attached to proponents of free will can be understood as "those in favor of qadar al-insiin." I am not sure what Sells means by there being a con- stant feature in these texts of a "symbiotic relationship between spirituality and embodiment" (p. 11). In some places, he seems, rightly, to be reminding readers that Sufis, and all Muslims, do not rely on texts and words, but they perform meaningful rituals as well. He has brought out in general a sense of the richness of early mystics, beyond asceticism, but none of them in EIM discuss accepting marriage for the sake of fealty to the sunnah, nor do they come near Ibn 'Arabi's embrace of the world and the body's pleasures as positive sites of di- vine manifestation and realization. This is the age of Bistami's famous thanksgiving for being freed from the burden of women "until I no longer took note whether it was a woman I encountered or a wall" (p. 240). Another, related, issue is the "grounding" that is spoken about at several places. There are a few good stories from daily life, and Muhasibi certainly provides concrete details of living among his contemporaries in his criticisms of their attitudes toward others ("How many traditions have you memorized? Who were your teachers? I haven't eaten for such and such a time. Who am I to be sleeping at dawn?" p. 191). I am aware of the difficulty of giving flesh to Sufi thought in the early period because of the nature of the sources. Still, I wish Sells had provided what little can be found about the lives and milieux of the subjects. For instance, it would be helpful to have a concise summary of the parties involved in Hallaj's trial and execution for his chapter. While on the subject of "grounding," one cannot help but be a little disappointed at the lack of women in the book, Rabi'ah's chapter notwithstanding. It is true that, only after the project was completed, the manuscript of SulamI's biographical book of Sufi women, Dhikr al- niswah al-muta'abbidiit al-sifiyat, was found, edited, and translated.28 But there are references to pious, inspi- rational women in the writings by and about early Sufi men. And Qushayri's tafsir, Latii'if al-ishiirdt, which is not translated here, gives Sufi interpretations to Qur'anic accounts of biblical women. Perhaps Sells could have highlighted them. 28 Though it was known and used by Ibn al-Jawzi and others, Dhikr al-niswah as a separate work with this title was only re- covered in 1991 by MahmUd al-Tandhi in Riyadh. He edited and published it in Cairo, 1993. A second, more complete edi- tion with translation was published by Rkia Cornell in 1999 (Louisville, Ky.: Fons Vitae).</page><page sequence="9">586 Journal of the American Oriental Society 122.3 (2002) Generally, the arrangement of the selections is well done. Qushayri's alfiz section from the Risilah comes before biographies and writings of earlier figures in preparation for some of the technical terms they use. A bit confusing is the presentation of the Mi'raj and Sharh sadr al-Nabi on pp. 47-56, some one hundred pages re- moved from AbU Yazid's mystical ascension. Some oversights have remained post-editing. The in- troduction promises a full transliteration the first time an Arabic proper name appears as well as uniformity in the way biblical figures' names are given, but inconsisten- cies are apparent throughout the book. In addition, Is- rad'l should be glossed as Jacob, not Isaac (p. 178); Potiphar's, not Pharaoh's, wife gets out the knives before Joseph enters her banquet hall (p. 341); and in 'Attar, soup must have been made with meat fat, not lard, which is an (American) English word most commonly associated with pork (p. 160). Qushayri's discussion of the shahid-beloved merits male gender pronouns and an explanatory note on the Sufi homoerotic controversy (pp. 146-47). Also, on a minor scale, we should have "sweet desserts" rather than "sweet deserts" (p. 255) and "theological plane" for "theological plain" (p. 271). Sells states at the outset that he is not interested in providing accurate but stilted translations of these texts. As he says with justification, "Specialists might as well read the original texts in the original languages" (p. 8). For specialists' courses and for anyone who wants to taste the delightful complexities of Islamic mystical writing before it became formulaic and attained the char- acter of the other developed religious sciences, Sells, with his superbly crafted English, stands alone. He has earned his poet's license. It is to be hoped that Paulist Press will continue to publish translations of Sufi works in its Classics of Western Spirituality series, particularly whole works by individual Sufis from the early period. I commend the Press, by the way, for breaking with its usual practice of using imagined portraits of the saintly authors on the covers of the books being translated. The Bosnian mih- rab painting Sells chose for EIM, though removed from early Sufis in time and place, still shares more with them than the beardless man who graces their Bezels of Wis- dom cover shares with the historical Ibn 'ArabI. A final comment on appearances concerns formatting and type- faces. At first the italicized paragraphs that mark Sells' commentary put me on edge, as if each sentence ended with an exclamation point. After relaxing I found the variations in font sizes and style nicely reminiscent of printed early modern English sermons, and oddly fitting.</page></plain_text>
