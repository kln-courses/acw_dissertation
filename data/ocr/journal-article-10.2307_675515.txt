<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ecological Imagery and Cultural Adaptability: The Canelos Quichua of Eastern Ecuador NORMAN E. WHITTEN, JR. University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Ecological imagery among the Upper Amazonian Canelos Quichua native peoples of eastern Ecuador provides a paradigmatic, symbolic template organized by sets of cosmological premises. This template, anchored by traditional shamanism and ceramic manufacture, is invoked in emotionally charged ceremonial and juropolitical contexts to express resistance to nonnative culture bearers who have a potential or real impact on the ecosystem and indigenous political economy. The imagery is described as it exists within a system of radical change. Mechanisms are discussed whereby ecosystem knowledge and social structure are systemically linked to cosmological premises within a dynamic system of indigenous cultural adaptability. [Ecuador, symbolism of Canelos Quichua, Amazoni- an cosmology, cultural adaptability, ecological imagery] INTRODUCTION THE COLOMBIAN ANTHROPOLOGIST Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff (1971, 1975, 1976) has done more than anyone else, it seems, to deflate the intellectual notion embedded in both structuralist rationalism (e.g., LUvi-Strauss 1963, 1974) and cultural materialist em- piricism (e.g., Harris 1974:6, 1975) that cosmology and ideology may be most produc- tively considered as superstructural masking devices. Turning to the tropical rain forest ecosystem of the Northwest Amazon for his exemplar, Reichel (1971:xv) equates cosmology with "real infrastructure," and establishes a cognitively oriented research strategy paving the way to what he calls "the true ecological perspective," which NORMAN E. WHITTEN, JR., studied anthropology at Colgate and at North Carolina (Ph.D., 1964). He has been conducting field research with Afro-American and indigenous peoples of lowland South America since his first trip to Ecuador in 1961 and has also done fieldwork in the U.S. and Canada. He joined the faculty of the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1970, where he is professor of anthropology and inter- disciplinary fellow in tropical ecology. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1976-77 and recently published two books, Black Frontiersmen and Sacha Runa. He is completing a second book on the Canelos Quichua and editing one entitled Cultural Transformation and Ethnicity in Modern Ecuador. Whitten and his wife, Sibby, a medical sociologist, maintain an applied program of health delivery care in eastern Ecuador through the auspices of the Sacha Runa Research Foundation, Urbana. 836</page><page sequence="2">Whitten] ECOLOGICAL IMAGERY IN ECUADOR 837 consists . . . in describing and analyzing the meaning of the native's intelligence du milieu, and this interpretation can only be accomplished by an extremely detailed study of the native's evaluation, categorization, and "use" of such aspects as geographical features, fauna and flora, meteorological phenomena, sounds, colors, movements. ... These and other categories are culturally coded and constitute a means by which "reality" is handled and man is fitted into the biotope. More recently, in the 1975 Huxley Memorial Lecture, Reichel (1976) stated his perspec- tive with persuasive force: Aboriginal cosmologies and myth structures, together with the ritual behaviour derived from them, represent in all respects a set of ecological principles . . . [which] formulate a system of social and economic rules that have a highly adaptive value in the continuous endeavor to main- tain a viable equilibrium between the resources of the environment and the demands of society [Reichel-Dolmatoff 1976:308]. Amazonian cultures, he argues, present us with abstract philosophies and with ecological theory. While many contemporary ethnographers agree with Reichel's general position, a severe limitation for continuing investigations of ecological and symbolic pro- cesses through ethnographic studies of lowland South American peoples is evident: the vast majority of indigenous peoples in the moist tropics of South America are currently being subjected to radical shifts in ecology brought about by national and international efforts at resource extraction, cash cropping, tourism, evangelism, and colonization. It is uncomfortably easy to draw the conclusion that fragmentation of ideological systems is inevitable under conditions of such radical change. The thorough disruption of native lifeways, including ethnocide and even genocide in some areas (see, e.g., Arcand 1972; Dostal 1972; Varese 1972; Arvelo Jim~nez 1973; Friede, Freidemann, and Fajardo 1975; Arens 1976; Davis and Matthews 1976; Lizot 1976; Chagnon 1977; Davis 1977) is often based upon previous disruption (e.g., Case- ment 1912, Collier 1968, Grohs 1974, Sweet 1975, Naranjo 1977). The devastating ef- fects of disease and displacement on indigenous peoples and their societies, together with the fragility of the neotropical ecosystem (Lathrap 1970, Meggers 1971, Farnsworth and Golley 1974, Gross 1975), raise the question of whether a careful analysis of indigenous cosmology can do more than turn up crystalline fragments of shattered lifeways. The purpose of this paper is to present evidence of structural coherence and adap- tability manifest in an Upper Amazonian culture - the Canelos Quichua of east-central Ecuador--undergoing rapid, perhaps cataclysmic, change. The general perspective set out by Reichel-Dolmatoff is carried to a system of radical change to demonstrate the con- tinuing value inherent in considering ecological and symbolic processes within a unified framework. Symbolic processing of ecological imagery among the Canelos Quichua, I shall argue, promotes effective communication about ecosystem dynamics and generates a myriad of metaphoric predications (Fernandez 1974) allowing for both cultural con- tinuity and change within an environment of ecosystem transformation. This paper presents a more condensed analysis and interpretation of data than does the book Sacha Runa. Ethnicity and Adaptation ofEcuadorianJungle Quichua (Whitten 1976a). It also incorporates new data from intensive field research totaling eight addi- tional months interspersed over a four-year period during which time remarkable ecosystem alteration occurred, and equally remarkable adaptive processes were evident.' Ethnographic Setting The Canelos Quichua of eastern Ecuador live in a large, hilly, rain-forest area ranging from the 3,000-ft. elevation of Puyo eastward to the 800-ft. elevations near the border of Peru. The heartland of nucleated settlements is on the Bobonaza River, extending north-</page><page sequence="3">838 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 east from Puyo and Canelos to Villano on the Villano River and Curaray (Jesus Pitishca), on the Curaray River. From other Bobonaza sites of Sarayacu, Teresa Mama, and Mon- talvo, the area fans out north to the Corrientes, Conambo, and Pindo Yacu rivers. The population is somewhere between 9,000 and 12,000 indigenous people, with major con- centrations near trade-administration sites such as Puyo (the largest town in eastern Ecuador with its 10,000 nonindigenous population), Canelos, Pacayacu, Sarayacu, Teresa Mama, and Montalvo, on the Bobonaza River, and Curaray on the Curaray River. East of the Llushin River, the Pastaza River defines the boundary between "Jivaro proper" (Untsuri Shuari--Harner 1972) and Achuara. The area south of the Bobonaza from the Yatapi River eastward is inhabited by Achuara Jivaroans who are variously allied with groupings of Canelos Quichua. There are also Achuara groupings north and northeast of Canelos Quichua territory on the Corrientes and Conambo rivers; intermar- riage and other forms of alliance between Achuara and the Canelos Quichua exist. There are bilingual, bicultural Achuara throughout the Canelos Quichua area. The subsistence economy is based on swidden slash-mulch and more rarely slash-burn cultivation of manioc, sweet potatoes, taro, plaintain, palm, maize, and, in some areas, peanuts. Root crops are strictly in the domain of female labor and female knowledge. Ex- tensive use of chicha, a female-produced manioc gruel drink of very low alcoholic con- tent, is made. Plaintain and maize cultivation is primarily a male activity. Men hunt and fish, exploiting widely the diurnal and nocturnal protein resources of their acknowledged territory, and of selected territories of other indigenous peoples, as well (see., e.g., Karsten 1935; Whitten 1976a, in press, for more detail). Gathering of nuts and fruits, in- sects, insect larvae, land and water snails and crustaceans, and turtles and turtles eggs, and poultry raising supplement hunting, fishing, and horticulture. The economic system of the Jivaro proper (Harner 1972) and Achuara is essentially the same, except hor- ticulture is perhaps less intensive and less extensive than that of the Canelos Quichua. There is a current turn to some large-animal husbandry (cattle, horses) in the western area, together with some small-scale cash cropping as part of a polycultural swidden. The egalitarian (Fried 1967) social system is composed of intermarried segments of kin- ship units, ayllu, centered around powerful shamans who duel with other powerful shamans by reciprocating killing spirit projectiles. A division of labor by sex, and a con- cept approximating that of parallel transmission of kin class status (Scheffler and Lounsbury 1971; Whitten 1976a:121, 139-140) are also characteristic. Indigenous ter- ritories ramify out of each of the main trade-administrative sites. Within these territories, allied, intermarried, segments of larger kinship units are grouped into named subter- ritorial units, Ilacta. Achuara Jivaroans and some Jivaro proper are intermarried within Canelos Quichua kin units, and marriage exchanges with Achuara of the Conambo, Cor- rientes, Capahuari, and Copotaza river areas take place. Sporadic evangelical efforts by Catholic friars have centered on Canelos Quichua culture from the 16th century to the present with various emphases in the different ter- ritories. At the sites of Catholic Dominican penetration- especially Canelos, Pacayacu, Sarayacu, Montalvo and Curaray-there has been an obvious effort to impose an ec- clesiastical sense of order. Dominican friars consistently confronted a situation whereby they were accepted for a brief period by Canelos Quichua groupings, asked to provide trade goods, medicine, and adju licative advice, and then asked to leave. When the friars did not leave, indigenous people did, dispersing to various second, often hidden, garden plots from six-hours to two-days trek to the west, north, or east. The church eventually developed a system of visits wherein they would call for a fiesta (which became jista, in Quichua) to be held at the trade-administrative site. During the fiesta, sacraments would be administered, disputes adjudicated, goods passed out, marriages performed, and</page><page sequence="4">Whitten] ECOLOGICAL IMAGERY IN ECUADOR 839 names recorded for diocese lists. Today, in the focal areas of the Catholic mission activi- ty, ceremonial enactment draws on a paradigm of ecological imagery to express rejection of the church. Prominent secular events in recent history include the Amazonian rubber boom of the late 19th century which penetrated the fringes of Canelos Quichua territory and stimulated the development of Puyo as an Andean-Amazonian trade site; Royal Dutch Shell oil explorations in the 1930s; sugar plantation development and consequent col- onization begun in the 1930s and continually expanding; Peruvian invasion of Ecuador and penetration into this area in the 1940s; development of national infrastructure of roads, towns, and schools in the western area of Canelos Quichua territory from the 1950s to the present; establishment and expansion of tea plantations, with more colonization from the late 1950s on; and return of oil explorations during the 1960s and 1970s. Near Puyo, indigenous peoples were dislodged from earlier homesites and resettled in jungle territory now ringed by plantations. Today, in the Puyo area, indigenous juropolitical ac- tivity draws on the same paradigm of ecological imagery to express rejection of national bureaucratic control of the ecosystem (Whitten 1976b). Cosmological Features The "paradigm of ecological imagery," which the Canelos Quichua draw on to express rejection of the Catholic church and to protest national bureaucratic control of the ecosystem, must be understood by reference to certain organizing aspects of their cosmological system. The most convenient way to present these aspects is by reference to some anthropological constructs. It must be emphasized here that the concepts presented are apparent in the remote jungle regions of Canelos Quichua culture, in the ad- ministrative nuclei of the river settlements, and on the outskirts of urbanizing Puyo. Canelos Quichua cosmology is based on concepts of animism as discussed by Tylor (1873) and animatism as originally set forth by Marret (1909). Some things are inbued with particular strength which allows individuals with a special relationship to such things to have a degree of control over other people, over social events, and much more tenuously, over nature. Such relationships are usually discussed, and presumably thought of, in terms of a person's soul, aya, and the soul of the particular thing. Spirits, supai, are also postulated as ubiquitous, and each spirit also has a soul. Spirits, too, have special relationships with things and with humans. Relationships between a spirit and a person or thing are discussed in terms of postulated relationships of the spirit's soul to the person's soul or thing's soul. Souls and spirits are grouped by certain dominant "sign-images" (Fernandez 1974:120).2 For example, Sacha Runa, jungle person, is a multivocalic, associationally complex, ambiguous, open-ended, highly condensed (cf. Turner 1973, 1974, 1975) sign- image which may be abstracted as symbol (Fernandez 1974:120) to refer to the Canelos Quichua themselves, to other jungle people (Jivaroans such as Shuara, Achuara, Maina; Zaparoans such as Andoa-Shimigae, Ziparo; Candoshi such as Shapra, Murato; and Huaorani "Auca"), to a postulated spirit master, to the spirit of the forest, to the spirit of Datura, to a master of animals, in either singular or plural form. The dominant sign- images may be grouped as transformations from even more condensed master- images-Amasanga for Sacha Runa - and such condensation invokes discussion of two other highly condensed master-images: Nunghui and Sungui. The latter two concepts are common in Jivaroan culture (Harner 1972 for the Untsuri Shuara; Pita Kalekna, Christine Taylor-Descola, Phillipe Descola, Jane Ross and Eric Ross, personal conversa- tions, for the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Achuara). Discussion of any one of the three master-images invariably results in transmission of concepts and observations pertaining to the relationships between phenomena relegated</page><page sequence="5">840 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 to the contrastive domains delimited by the master-imagery. Because discussion of any one of these master-images promotes discussion of the other two images, I refer to rela- tionships inherent in the imagery as "paradigmatic" (cf., Firth 1975:14).3 Because the in- formation conveyed is set forth in terms of relationships between plants, animals, insects, fish, humans, souls, and spirits of forest, air, soil and water, I refer to it as "ecological" (cf., Bateson 1972). Ecological imagery among the Canelos Quichua is readily apparent in the "traditional" activities of feminine ceramic manufacture and decoration and in masculine shamanism; we will draw upon these highly ritualized, stylized activities in discussing the relationships among vision, thought, and knowledge. This imagery is also evoked repeatedly in emotionally charged ceremonial and juropolitical contexts to express resistance to nonnative culture bearers who have a poten- tial or real impact on the ecosystem. As such, the paradigmatic imagery may be regarded as providing a cognitive basis, or symbolic template (Geertz 1966, 1973:92ff), for protest. It is through the analysis of the structural aspects of protest in both ritual and political arenas that I hope to contribute to the analysis of intercultural relationships in settings of contemporary radical change.

Some common master image-sign image relationships or transformations. PARADIGMATIC IMAGERY AND CULTURAL ADAPTABILITY From the outset of this analysis it must be understood clearly that concepts such as closed system versus open system do not fare well when applied to the Canelos Quichua. These people actively accept some aspects of ecclesiastical and nationalist sponsored change within their political economy. For example, adjudication of some interpersonal disputes, modification of shelter and clothing, some national infrastructural development--airstrips, roads, schools--and modern medicine for ubiquitous diseases are generally regarded as acceptable and desirable modifications of their indigenous</page><page sequence="6">Whitten] ECOLOGICAL IMAGERY IN ECUADOR 841 system. What is steadfastly rejected is the destruction of dominant aspects of the tropical forest-swidden-riparian ecosystem, and the Western capitalist set of utility values (Sahlins 1976) attached to acceptable modifications. Examples of the former include strong resistance to any sort of pesticides or herbicides whatsoever; resistance to water pollution, whether by urban waste or increased silt as a result of road construction; resistance to permanent fixed-field horticulture; and resistance to pressures to permanently clear forest areas larger than six to ten acres. Such resistance is always discussed in terms of ramifying strings of effect within the food chain which terminate in diseases of plant, insects, animals, birds, fish, and humans. The resistance to the ideological aspect of political economy alternation seems to stem from an implicit premise of Western culture most recently explicated in anthropological literature by Marshall Sahlins (1976). Writing of what he calls "Bourgeoise Society," Sahlins (1976:178) states: reproduction of the whole of nature constitutes an objectification of the whole of culture. By the systematic arrangement of meaningful differences assigned the concrete, the cultural order is realized also as an order of goods. The goods stand as an object code for the signification and valuation of persons and occasions, functions, and situations. Operating on a specific logic of correspondence between material and social contrasts, production is thus the reproduction of the culture in a system of objects. I do not mean to imply here that the Canelos Quichua have anticipated Sahlins' ex- position of the utility value inherent in Western capitalism. What I am suggesting is that the Canelos Quichua react adversely to the myriad of cues presented by nonnative in- truders which consistently signal an alien cultural order expressed in Western values placed on goods. Adverse reactions are expressed directly through simple statements, and allusively, through paradigmatic imagery, in various contexts. The Canelos Quichua seem to sense a clear stress on the reproduction of an alien culture in a system of Western objects in virtually every encounter with nationalist and nonnationalist administrators, planners, developers, colonists, tradesmen, or evangelists. They accept many objects, in- deed are dependent on some such as machetes and axes, but act and speak so as to suggest repeatedly a rejection of the logic of Western utility value as basic to the transformation of their cultural system. We find Canelos Quichua paradigmatic imagery to be as clearly discernible in contexts involving indigenous response to an alien cultural logic and praxis as in contexts of shamanistic performance and pottery manufacture. Although the semantic transforma- tions and symbolic processing of the master-image paradigm is context specific, the paradigm itself transcends contextuality. Paradigmatic structures are presumably part of a semiotic system by which imagery is transmitted through a contrastive set of signs. Sym- bolic processing is based on positional arrangement. With regard to symbolism, Dan Sperber (1975:137) argues that cultural symbolism focuses the attention of the members of a single society in the same directions, determines parallel evocational fields that are structured in the same way, but leaves the in- dividual free to effect an evocation in them as he likes. Cultural symbolism creates a commonality of interest, but not of opinions. By "evocation" Sperber (1975:119) means "a search in the memory." Evocation together with "focalization," which is a "displacement of attention," constitute the two aspects of what he refers to as "symbolic processing." Ecosystem knowledge provides one type of shared commonality of interest based on habitat exploitation. Ideology refers to another type of commonality of interest based on cultural coding. Paradigmatic structures presumably unite such commonality of interests, providing shared means for objectifying correspondence structures drawn from observation and from extant codes.</page><page sequence="7">842 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 The structure of ideas to which we now turn involves the intersecting spheres of in- fluence of the three master-images in Canelos Quichua culture which can be invoked in multiple ways to express metaphors signaling known ecological dynamics, to suggest flexi- ble animal-human and plant-human relationships, and to move people to ceremonial and political action. The paradigm is bound up in the transformational, positional, associational, and exegetical properties of A masanga, Nunghui (also pronounced Nznghui), and Sungui (also pronounced Tsungui), which Canelos Quichua exegesis relates initially to the dynamics of forest, soil, and water. In a somewhat overly simplistic sense we can say that this paradigm and its various qualities is anchored in Canelos Quichua culture through this developmental sequence: children learn, youths practice and experiment, parents teach, shamans know and transmit, powerful shamans (male) and master potters (female) manipulate and preserve. The paradigm, teased out of field data from daily life and made explicit by some native exegetes, is not necessarily, of itself, "symbolic," in Sperber's sense (or in that of Fernandez 1974:132); rather, its sign-imagery provides a cognitive basis for encoding and organizing "encyclopedic knowledge" necessary for symbolic processing.4 Canelos Quichua paradigmatic imagery is particularly elaborate in sectors where the postulated force fields with sentient spirit foci interpenetrate. Rain, for example, is of the water domain, and nearly omniscient evidence of Sungui's power in the world. But forest spirit A masanga controls the weather - thunder and lightening belong to him. The con- ceptual interplay between Amasanga and Sungui during thunderstorms links the non- domesticated forest with the water domain. Nunghui, a strictly female spirit, controls the soil base for the roots of garden life, and the pottery clay. Pottery is the medium for stor- ing and serving chicha, regarded as a merger of root food (basically manioc) and water. The conceptual interplay between Nunghui and Sungui imagery during the production of chicha and production of ceramics links the domesticated earth domain (garden soil- pottery clay) with the water domain. Finally, for another example of allegorical interplay between sentient spirit force fields, A masanga is regarded as a domesticator of animals (or as a principle of game animal increase) and Nunghui as a domesticator of pottery clay and root crops. The Amasanga-Nunghui conceptual interplay as allied sets of male- female oppositions expressed in terms of division of labor and affinity metaphors also links forest life and garden life with human life. For the Canelos Quichua, playing flutes, singing songs, and telling myths punctuate discussion of A masanga, Nunghui, and Sungui. These activities are, among other things, mechanisms for associational, or analogic, linking of ecosystem knowledge to social rules and breaches, and social dynamics to cosmological premises. We turn now to a brief illustrative description of common intracultural strings of analogic association within each of the master-images before returning to their paradigmatic nature, and the paradigmatic expression of protest and resistance in emo- tionally charged ceremonial and juropolitical contexts. Amasanga: Forest Spirit A masanga is a convenient starting point for a portrayal of this paradigm. He is fre- quently called Sacha supai runa, or Sacha Runa. He is sometimes known as sacha apu, jungle head; from the standpoint of a postulated spirit animal or soul of a contemporary animal he is paiba curaga, its chief. He is conceived of as generally male, but may also be conceptualized as enchantress, Sacha huarmi, jungle [spirit] woman, or Sacha chagra mama, female spirit master of plants not domesticated by humans but which are analogous to them (e.g., "deer manioc," "deer papaya," "catfish taro," "quail yam," "jungle sweet potato"). His special tree, pasu, looks something like a wild zapote and pro-</page><page sequence="8">Whitten] ECOLOGICAL IMAGERY IN ECUADOR 843 duces a zapote-like fruit. It is now planted by the Canelos Quichua and by the Achuara of the Capahuari-Copotaza. His coat is black, yana, ranging from bright blue through jet black with its prototype in the black shimmering feathers and dark blue skin of the white throated toucan, sicuanga. Amasanga's representation as a principle of antiquity, and as a concept of collective endurance after individual death, is found in petrified wood which is regarded as his "soul bone." Amasanga is conceived of in male form as having three reptilian seats, bancu: a greenish-brown lizard (conceived of as red, puca, because of its brownish-red throat), called tiutipa, or sacharuna; a small iguana, jayambi; and the land tortoise, yahuati or tsahuata. His animal manifestation is the great black jaguar. He carries a blowgun, wears a snake-skin headpiece, a lizard-skin bracelet, and travels on the surface of the water on amarun, a boa constrictor canoe. A masanga may be described in terms of two male transformations, both of them fear- some to nonshamans. The first of these isJurijuri. In the times of great changes, from mythic time, unai, to ancient times, callari rucuguna, A masanga began to grow teeth in the back of his head, and, becomingJurijuri, went underground in hills and caves. Juri juri is conceptualized in his two face form as both male and female (front face) and male and female (back face), and as a representation of increasing numbers of Amasanga spirits. Jurijuri allegorically domesticates game animals, game birds, the cayman, and the boa-anaconda, amarun.5 The caves and under-hill areas are conceived of as merging points of linear time (from "Ancient times" through "grandparental times" to "present times"), of mythic time-space and of land and water. TodayJurijuri has a special rela- tionship with monkeys, which are conceptualized as possessing foreign people's souls. The second A masanga transformation is the waterfall spirit, Paccha supai, which pro- tects large game animals (tapir, capybara, peccary, deer) in distant hunting territories. He comes to a man who is dreaming in the forest, at night, within rain and a dark cloud, accompanied by a great wind. Some bilingual, bicultural Achuara from the Copotaza- Capahuari area, now living in the Puyo area, equate the Paccha supai vision with that of the Jivaroan Arutam, and their description is identical to that given by Harner (1972). In female transformational forms, A masanga's jungle domain penetrates that of the water and soil domains. Julas (or Ulas) is the spirit of the rapids, where land rises sharply within a river; she is a dangerous jungle enchantress just under the water. Allpa supai (nondomesticated) soil spirit is a dangerous feminine under-soil spirit, andJuri juri huar- mi is a female spirit master of postulated cave-dwelling spirit monkeys. Women sometimes create images of A masanga as jungle enchantress in the form of a ceramic sacharuna, jayambi, or yahuati (A masanga bancus from the male standpoint) and use the figurine as a familiar spirit helper in sending songs to distant or estranged husbands or lovers. More rarely, a woman with very special relationships to the spirit world may make a ceramicJurijuri to use in the same manner. Production of such ceramic familiars may be accompanied by production of a ceramic game animal associated with the area to which the song is being sent. Some shamans call A masanga in the three feminine forms (under-water, under-earth, under-hill [cave] ) when they wish to kill enemies. In combined, tripartite, feminine form, the killing spirit is known as Pasuca supai. People avidly deny that there is a rela- tionship between pasuca as killing spirit formed by the shaman, and pasu as A masanga's master tree image. Nunghui: Spirit of Garden Soil and Pottery Clay Nunghui is the feminine under-soil master of garden soil and pottery clay. Her basic color is also shimmering, irridescent black. Mythic conceptualization of Nunghui is in</page><page sequence="9">844 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 terms of accumulation of under-soil feminine power linked to the domestication of root crops in clearings. Let me illustrate. In the time of great changes from mythic to ancient times, the supai pasu huarmi, spirit pasu tree woman (or spirit pasu, feminine form), went underground after having been hit on the head by the pasu spirit fruit dropped down on her by Amasanga. She became Nunghui, in this context, Amasanga huarmi. Though linked to Amasanga, she is not regarded as a jungle spirit by men or by women, but rather as a separate under-soil garden spirit. The contrast between jungle spirit and garden soil spirit is evident in other stories of mythic events. One such story involves an origin myth where the moon, Quilla, has sexual relation- ships with his sister,Jilucu, a Potoo (Nyctibius species) bird. Out of this incestuous union were born the stars, with human souls. In the times of great changes, when things were taking on their present forms, Jilucu turned Quilla into a hummingbird, Quindi, who was married to her daughter, Junculu, a small harmless brown snake (sometimes a toad instead of a snake) associated with swidden gardens. In this story and in all stories and versions involving the domestication of root crops, Nunghui is regarded as synonymous with either Jilucu orJunculu, depending on the teller. Quindi, as strong young man, was clearing a section of jungle whenJunculu came to plant. The clearing by Quindi and the coming ofJunculu to plant are separate episodes. Quindi is not helpingJunculu.Junculu coming to a clearing to plant relates to the origin of the domestication of root crops; the male clearing of jungle does not. Junculu worked and worked with her palm-wood digging stick and dug and dug until she dug herself under the ground and was enchanted there; she could not get out. Quindi, in retaliation for having been turned into a hummingbird byJilucu, blew at her and caused her to stay underground as Chagra mama, master spirit of garden plants. Manduru huarmi, an- thropomorphic feminine form Bixa orellana, and Huiduj huarmi, anthropomorphic feminine form Genipa americana lived together with Chagra mama, as her "sisters." Nayapi, Muscivora tyrannus monachus, wanted to marry Manduru, but she refused; Huaihuashi, red squirrel, wanted to marry Huiduj, but she refused. The accumulation of feminine power under the soil, some exegetes may explain, did not expand alliances through affinity to avarian and mamalian life of the forest." In contemporary times, Puyo Runa exegesis of Nunghui, in affinal analogies, links her to Amasanga as roots are linked to tree trunks, as husband is linked to wife, and perhaps, as brother is linked to sister. She is also linked by affinity to the hummingbird. She has two dominant transformations as Chagra mama, garden spirit master, and Manga allpa mama, pottery clay spirit. An under-soil manifestation of soul substance is bound up with the red tulumba (or turumba) frog, regarded as a descendant of Junculu, the "mother" of toads/frogs. The tulumba frog is a living soul which has transformed from a polished soul stone, aya rumi, containing the bottled up living soul of a deceased male shaman. Tulumba is said to give off a secretion from which potent dart poison can be made. Tulumba does not fall within the sphere of the Nunghui spirit master-image, but the dominant sign-image Chagra mama evokes discussion of it. Tulumba is seen as generating a force allegorically chan- neled by Nunghui (as Chagra mama) into the domestication of root crops. Tulumba is regarded as one manifestation of the manioc "force" (for want of a better word), Lumu mama. Lumu mama is represented as a black soul stone, as a hair ball in the stomach of the collared peccary (lumucuchi, manioc peccary), and as a caterpillar which pupates into a day hummingbird moth or a weevil. Lumu mama is a human soul, both male and female. Canelos Quichua exegesis makes the Lumu mama caterpillar (or one that resembles it) analogous to the Nunghui manifestation brown snake, and the hum- mingbird moth is regarded as analogous to Nunghu's hummingbird husband, Quindi. Quindi may also be symbolized as involving a double transformation from caterpillar to</page><page sequence="10">Whitten] ECOLOGICAL IMAGERY IN ECUADOR 845 hummingbird. The caterpillar, representing the "manioc force," pupates into a hum- mingbird moth or a weevil. During pupation the cocoon is analogous to a soul stone which embodies the principle of transformation found in polished stones (see Whitten 1976a:42, 148-149). The moth or weevil, when very old, allegorically builds a second "house" within which transformation of moth or weevil into true hummingbird takes place. Lumu mama, as a hair ball in the stomach of the collared peccary, represents an enduring soul substance found in an animal that digs in the forest (domain of A masanga, as Sacha chagra mama) as a woman digs in her own chagra. Nunghui, as Chagra mama, mythically placed a white-lipped peccary skull on a log in the chagra to frighten agouti, and other rodents, from the chagra. She animated the log with the power of Lumu mama (see Whitten 1976a:56). Nunghui has two discrete color manifestations, though her base color is shimmering black: jet black represented by the Genipa americana, and red represented by the Bixa orellana. These colors are used for painting people. Their clay and stone analogs are mined by the Canelos Quicha for painting ceramics. Through the medium of fire, Nunghui, as Manga allpa mama, transforms clay and stone dyes into discrete black, red, and white colors on pottery. Before turning to the third master-image, Sungui, in this tripartite paradigm, it is essential to consider some aspects of visionary imagery in Canelos Quichua culture. Vision and Imagery The human portal for visionary imagery is conceptualized by the Canelos Quichua as deriving from huanduj, Datura (Solanacea Brugmansia sp.). The concept of Datura stresses a spirit order which is alien from, but coexistent with, the waking world of humans. Canelos Quichua exegesis relates A masanga and Nunghui as "of" or "from" Datura. They are huanduj supai, Datura spirits. To induce a prolonged, overwhelming vision of an otherwise disguised spirit universe, datura is used. The taker drinks squeez- ings from the inner bark and central pulp of the woody stem and is propelled within a few minutes directly into the spirit visionary world wherein a continuous series of visual- auditory-tactile episodes is experienced for six to 12 hours. A masanga, as spirit shaman, mediates between the spirits and human souls in the spirit world, and between the spirit world and other unknown realms. For women, A masanga as Sacha huarmi, or huanduj supai huarmi, does the same. The return to the waking world is facilitated by a dual im- age of A masanga, for men, of Nunghui and A masanga (in feminine transformation as Sacha huarmz), for women. This return is characterized by coterminous interaction within normal surroundings and continuing hallucinations for one to three days. During this period the seeker sees both waking world and the spirit world. The former endures as the latter fades away. Master-images Amasanga, and Nunghui are not in and of themselves merely "visions," defined by the root muscuna, as muscuyu or muscui. They are foci for the organization of overwhelming visionary experience, sought occasionally by a man or a woman, sometimes only once in a lifetime, never very often. Vision itself comes fundamentally from dreams, and the Canelos Quichua seek to understand their dream mechanisms. It is important to them to be able to awaken after dreaming, to sift the jumble of images into an analyzable system of signs and symbols through which past knowledge is related to observed behavior. Flashes of insight in which one realizes the relationships of dream content to previous knowledge, experiences, or sets of encoding devices are also regarded "visionary." Long before dawn, men and women converse with one another about the night's dreams, and they seek dynamic, shared, perceived relationships among dream content, personal and social situation, graphic design, and mythic event. Shamans use ayahuasca, soul vine (Banisteriopsis sp.), to allow them and their clients</page><page sequence="11">846 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 to travel between the waking and spirit worlds. Ayahuasca is thought to induce a dream- like reality which mediates the human domain of dreams and the spirit domain of Datura. But shamanistic mediation is predicated on the control and manipulation of power, utipana, from a motivating source, and this source is bound up with Sungui, the third element in the paradigm. We turn now to this master-image. Sungui: Water Spirit Sungui is the spirit master of the water domain and its postulated inhabitants, the yacu supai runa, water spirit people. This sentient force field is regarded as the ultimate source of biosphere, lithosphere, and atmosphere power; all shamanistic power ultimate- ly derives from Sungui's domain. A manifestation of Sungui (as Urcu mama, see below), is found in the pupation dynamics of a large helgramite, mayfly larvae, or water bug, col- lectively classed apahuaicu, and conceptualized as a "water spirit stone" in feminine form. Where A masanga and Nunghui embody the concepts of domestication of animals and plants, respectively, I tentatively suggest that Sungui metaphors portray a hydraulic principle wherein hydrosphere dynamics are signaled and an environment out of which life originally emerged. Sunguz, whether male or female manifestation, is dressed in a beautiful multicolor cloak representing the spectrum with predominant red. This spirit sits on a bancu which is either the cayman, or the large water turtle, charapa. The latter, as a Sungui bancu, is Yacu julas, the feminine water representation of the rapids. Sungui's corporeal manifestation is the great anaconda, yacu amarun, which is also seen as his canoe (on which he travels under the water). The concept of increase in Sunguz's domain is bound up with the freshwater porpoise, bdjiu (or bzigiu) in feminine form; the porpoise caused fish to proliferate. Men use porpoise substances to attract women and fish, and women may call the feminine porpoise, through song, to "go after" a man, and make him feel both guilt over transgressions, and fondness and longing for the woman. All amarun manifestations-including anacondas, boas, and the rainbow-span the force fields of water, garden, and jungle. Human use of amarun substance and symbolism is extensive, penetrating virtually every otherwise discrete domain. Symbolism of SunguZ's domain in terms of feminine form, Yacu mama, reveals three dimensions. The first is the world dimension manifest in rivers, swamps, bogs, fog, rain clouds, rain, and in mire following excessive rain with flood, or where the jungle has been stripped of its plants and churned up by human or peccary activity. The second is the sky domain, where long dark clouds represent "high rivers." And the third is the underground domain with underground rivers.7 In (or just beyond) the latter, fire and water are conceived of as meeting and the merger is manifest during volcanic and earth- quake activity. There is also an association with the enduring souls of the dead, huanushca aya, and tenuously contained cosmic power, utipana, derived from the merger of fire and water. This power source itself is beyond the domain of Sungui, but discussion of Sungui evokes these associations and focuses discussants' attention on such postulated relationships. When discussing Sungui, or an aspect of this water force field, it is common to elicit the statement that all spirits and souls are really the same, that they all derive from this domain. But under no circumstances in Canelos Quichua exegetical portrayal can Sungui be related to the Datura visionary world. Sungui exists as a basic source of power derived ultimately, it seems, from the earth splitting merger of fire and water. Through the Datura spirits, Amasanga and Nunghui, control is generated to channel this power source of Sungui. Datura spirit control, and human control--usually referred to as a combination of vision and knowledge generating "strength"--is based upon forest</page><page sequence="12">Whitten] ECOLOGICAL IMAGERY IN ECUADOR 847 resources and swidden resources. These resources, in turn, are culturally focused through the A masanga and Nunghui master-imagery. Mythologically, the sun emerged from the water to bring day-night oscillating order and east-west directionality to the world. Amasanga and Nungui emerged as discrete Datura spirits with the discrete color manifestations after the sun brought order to emerging human life. Sungui, as a force field with nondiscrete, continuous, spectrum order, encompasses the very world to which it is contrasted. For this reason it seems to be a metaphor for the hydrosphere. Uterine imagery is also apparent, though implicit. Women making pottery symbolically embed their work within both the domains of Nunghui, as Manga allpa mama, and Sungui, as Urcu mama (Whitten and Whitten 1978). The discrete white, red, and black rock and clay dyes, and red and white slips, signal both the discrete colors of Nunghui and the spectrum of Sungui. Burnishing is done with a water-polished stone from Sungui's domain. The most prominent graphic designs are those of reptiles, especially frogs and toads, which underlie shaman power, manioc force, and allegorically embody the principle of transformation. During the ceramic manufacturing process, women converse gently, quietly, always without conflict, about ecosystem dynamics, especially those having to do with feminine domestication of plants and the male bringing of animals to clearings, and about new events in an outer world. As they do this they portray a juxtaposition of that which is regarded as ancient and traditional knowledge, with that which they perceive as new, and potentially destructive. When the concept of destruction becomes overwhelming, women talk of ultimate return of the indigenous people to the domain of Sungui, of death, and of one's soul liv- ing in the water, as a fish. Such discussion invariably inspires one or another woman to think of a deceased female relative, and to sing a song to her enduring soul. Sometimes the soul of a cherished dead relative is symbolically built into the wet clay, and then fired into the pot to give both soul and pot strength and endurance. Shamans also deal with the domain of Sungui. About 20 minutes after taking ayahuasca, an ancient waterfall is heard encompassing the house. Then, in about ten minutes more, two giant anacondas appear, undulating in parallel form around the shaman. As the shaman "sees" them as sinchi amarun, strong boa-anaconda image, women helpers who have snuffed tobacco water "identify" the dominant image as Yacu mama. As this feminine image is so identified, it examines the shaman's shungu,8 "stomach-heart" area where his spirit helpers reside; only after this symbolic examination signaling inner strength of the shaman as validified by Yacu mama has taken place does the shaman receive the A masanga image in the form of two great black jaguars. The jaguars represent the animal transformation, tucuna, of the shaman himself. Curing is done with the help of Amasanga, but within the power domain of Sungul in feminine form. When killing is performed through the transformation of A masanga into the three merged feminine forms - under-water, under-earth, under-hill (cave) - the shaman is possessed by Juri juri (who allegorically domesticated the amarun, a Sungui image). While serving as seat, bancu, for Jurijuri, the shaman tenuously, and destructively, channels this Sungui-derived power into a spirit lance, or other spirit projectile to kill an adversary shaman, or a member of the adversary's ayllu (Whitten 1976a:159-162). Knowledge, Vision, and Imagery Knowledge, from the verb root ricsina, derives from a combination of learning by in- struction, as children learn from parents and peers, and from observation. Pivotal im- agery for children revolves around Amasanga for males, Nunghui and Amasanga as Sacha huarmi for females. This imagery does not serve to disguise, or mask, observa-</page><page sequence="13">848 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 tional information. Rather it is employed to heighten the interpretative possibilities of discrete observations by providing multiple transformational, associational, allegorical, and indexical avenues. The integration of retrievable pieces of information with visionary and ideological aspects is regarded as personal. However, certain individuals, the male shamans and female master potters, serve as paradigm builders and manipulators. Embedded in both shamanistic procedure and the pottery tradition is the paradigmatic, semiotic base of master-imagery and sign-imagery upon which symbolism is generated. Symbolic processing, in turn, communicates, reshuffles, refocuses, and evokes a dynamic integration of ecosystem knowledge, personal experience, social structural coherence, and ideology. Where cosmological imagery is acquired first from parents, and then from shaman and ceramicist, knowledge must be acquired in an encyclopedic fashion from all available sources. For example, the fact that maize depletes soil more rapidly than manioc unless beans are planted with it, the fact that a venemous snake bite often kills, the fact that caterpillars pupate into moths, the fact that the commercial naranjilla (Solanum quitoense) plants are attacked by plagues and pests if planted as a monocultural crop, and the fact that governmental officials seldom listen to Indians when discussing the Upper Amazonian ecosystem, are all grouped as retrievable pieces of useful information. Such "facts" are indexed within systems of classification which in- clude botanical, zoological, icthyological hierarchies probably much like those described by Berlin (1973, 1976) for the Aguaruna Jivaroans of the Peruvian Montafia. But, especially in the Puyo area, such classification is also used to call forth concepts drawn from the A masanga-Nunghui-Sungui master-image paradigm to conceptualize and interpret contradictions expressed by the increasing numbers of outsiders who vent their judgments, values, and incompetencies upon the rain forest-swidden-riparian ecosystem. Knowledge grouped within a dynamic master-image/sign-image paradigm allows for symbolic processing of semantic and encyclopedic material. Basic to the ideology of the contemporary Canelos Quichua is a learning process, called yacha (from the verb yachana), through which an individual's thought or reflection, yuyana, dynamically and continuously integrates knowledge and vision. Care, also signaled by the verb root yuyana, is part of the knowledge-vision integration, for physical and social survival depends upon the nature of the result. Ancient culture and knowledge, yachai, are transmitted through the intracultural learning process, always embodying the knowledge gained from the outside, as well as inside. One who learns to control the learning process within himself, and to unite this self process with ancient culture, becomes yachaj, possessor of the learning process, and moves into shaman status. Let us turn now to illustrative ceremonial and juropolitical dimensions of this paradigm and the ways by which resistance and protest are expressed through it. CEREMONIAL ENACTMENT The basis of male activity signaling strength and control based on knowledge and vi- sion is expressed in a simple ritual, called yachajui, whereby a man walks in a circle, beating a snare drum with about four beats/step. The sound of the drum represents the thunder of Amasanga controlling the weather; the buzz of the snare evokes vision. Female activity signaling strength and control based on knowledge and vision is bound up in the preparation of chicha with a higher than normal alcoholic content, and possibly with a mild psychotropic effect (see Whitten 1976a:88). It is also embedded in the tradi- tion of producing ceramics. Both chicha production and ceramic production are tied to Nunghui and to Sungui. The power channeled by Sungui into the world of the living is rechanneled into human subsistence and human vision, respectively, by the underlying</page><page sequence="14">Whitten] ECOLOGICAL IMAGERY IN ECUADOR 849 "manioc force" which is represented through special polished stones and their cocoon, hair ball, and sometimes aquatic larvae analogs. When a man "walks like Amasanga," women force excessive amounts of chicha on him, ideally serving it in particularly fine, decorated, ceramic bowls. They sometimes douse him in it; this activity signals torrential rain, promoting flood. During Dominican church-sponsored and initiated annual or biannual ceremonies, chayuj, called jista via-a-vis church officials and outsiders, the Canelos Quichi a enact waste and excessive exploitation of rain forest-swidden-riparian resources. They call to them souls of animals, distant humans, and spirits, and play, pugllana, with them and with the new forms of putative, imposed order. Male hunts are organized to obtain ex- cessive amounts of monkey meat, large game meat, and fish. Women make excessive amounts of chicha, fungus chicha, and a heady cider-like drink from the drippings of the latter. As the ceremony gets under way, men enact the opposite of their normal respect toward animal souls through actions and words signaling abuse of monkey meat (sym- bolic of foreign people's captured souls domesticated by Amasanga, asJurijuri). They continuously drum the thunder of Amasanga, and the snares buzz a continuous calling for visionary experience. Women enact downpour and flood by forcing excessive amounts of chicha on everyone. Men also dance with women while drumming; women dance with men, but to Nunghui. Men play the song of the paspanchu bird on their transverse flutes, singing, essentially, "evil is coming but I meet it calmly." Men and women both sing songs which they regard as coming to them from deceased relatives and from spirits. They dance and sing as spirits or souls as time goes on, while continuing the enactment of thunderstorm, rain, and flood. Women's enactment of escalating chaos stresses graphic ceramic representation of the ancient and the new. They bring forth ceramic figurines illustrative of the immediate penetration of their ecosystem. For example, a pottery friar's boot, chalice, or hat brim- ming with chicha might be forced on a strong drummer. Figurines representing the duality of Canelos Quichua soul substance- that they are embedded in a new political- economic order and so Alli Runa, Good Indian, but that they are of the forest system, Sacha Runa - are also displayed with wreckless abandon as women continue to soak par- ticipants in a life-sustaining chicha deluge. Such figurines invariably symbolize something of the new, and much of A masanga or Nunghui in one or another transforma- tion. Women may also produce ceramic snakes, symbolizing shamanistic death and the encompassing power of Sungui. Still later, figurines directly representing Sungui, in- cluding ceramic fish, water mammals, or (rarely) aquatic larvae, are used to serve chicha and as plastic art vehicles of metaphoric animation. This activity builds in intensity for about 48 hours until a climax occurs just before dark. During this climax male dancers, representing an A masanga image, make and bear a bamboo representation of a spirit anaconda, a Sungui image, while women's song, dance, and ceramic figurines bring the ancient garden soil-pottery clay spirit, a Nunghui image, to dance with them in the increasing mire of the plaza (which represents the pend- ing domination of Sunguz). As the men circle the plaza, and the intensity of dancing by women increases, the women call the water spirit people to join them in the dance area (and, by association, the entire territory under the domination of the church). When this occurs the territory under tenuous dejure church control is metaphorically encompassed and flooded by the unleashed power channeled through the water domain. Ideally, and actually if not blocked by the clergy, the bamboo representation of Sungui is then borne by the men representing Amasanga through the church in serpentine fashion, where possible crashing through the church's bamboo walls. When this occurs, ceremonial participants voice the possibility that the continuous enactment of a thunderstorm (Amasanga image) and the female dance (Nunghui image) in Sungui's</page><page sequence="15">850 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 mire will, taken together, generate the mythic water-fire merger producing earthquake, volcanic eruption, and flood which, they say in such contexts, swept the ancient people eastward toward the sea. Should a flood recur, the Canelos Quichua say in such settings, they will swept away with the church. But, they add, the indigenous people will become regenerated through woody fungus, ala (see Whitten 1976:11, 52-53), while the church will be destroyed. Such enactment of the A masanga-Nunghui-Sungui master-image paradigm would appear, then, to represent the possibility of the sacrifice of the contem- porary people for the sake of freedom from the church. It is to be taken as a "root paradigm," in Victor Turner's (1974:15, 64, 67-68, 96) and Firth's (1975:14) terms. Turner (1977:74) summarizes the concept of root paradigm in this way: ". . . consciously recognized (though only on occasions of raised consciousness) cultural models of an allusive, metaphorical kind, cognitively delimited, emotionally loaded and ethically im- pelled, so as to give form to action in publicly critical circumstances." JUROPOLITICAL ENACTMENT Juropolitics in the Puyo area of Canelos Quichua territory is based upon the socioeconomic clash of evolving moist tropical subsistence ecosystem exploitation with that of Western cash-crop market economy (cf., Whitten in press). The latter is causing population expansion at the expense of ecosystem maintenance. Shamans have access to both economies. Within the indigenous system they are stem kindred nodal figures of the kinship-subterritorial (ayllu and lacta) socioeconomy. Because they charge fees for cur- ing, killing, and assistance in accumulation of shamanistic power for others, they have more stable access to cash than do most nonshamans. Also, because of their nodal posi- tion in the indigenous socioeconomy, they are often the recipients of payments for land sales as Western concepts of land ownership become pervasive. The shamans provide the creative, adaptable set of transformable interpretations link- ing cosmology, social structure, and ecology within any subterritory, at any given time. They serve as brokers, so to speak, between private symbolism and public symbolism (cf., Firth 1973:207-240). Since it is common for people seeking greater knowledge and sharper vision to visit shamans in various territories, shamanistic interpretations are con- tinuously disseminated. Such spread of interpretations occurs with news of developments throughout eastern Ecuador. For example, a shaman in Pacayacu who resides in an area experiencing petroleum exploration and the building of a new school may be visited in the same week by a client from Puyo, where urban growth and development are con- tinuous, and another from Sarayacu where Protestant evangelism is struggling with Dominican quasi domination. Another shaman living near Puyo may be visited by a Jivaro proper client from the Upano Valley who is a member of the Shuar Federation,9 and an Achuara from the lower Copotaza River who is an enemy of the Jfvaro proper, but considering affiliation with the Federation as a political act to reaffirm the generalized Jivaroan (Shuar) ethos of resistance to pending colonization. Ecosystems vary in these areas, and each is, from time to time, subject to very different kinds of intrusions. Because of the steady pattern of movement to and from various shamans, there is an evenness of spread of ideological interpretation throughout the Canelos Quichua culture area, while private conceptualization and synthesis remain highly diverse. Sons and sons-in-laws of powerful shamans who demonstrate language competence and social competence vis-d-vis outsiders are selected and/or elected (depending on the area) as representatives of indigenous groupings to governmental, military, and commer- cial-administrative-ecclesiastical personnel. The elder male (father, or father-in-law) shaman-younger male (son or son-in-law) spokesman union is very close, and severe com- petition with cognate dyads is normal. The shaman must have allegorically driven the</page><page sequence="16">Whitten] ECOLOGICAL IMAGERY IN ECUADOR 851 resident Juri juri from his llacta, while retaining the ability to bring it to him when necessary (an allegorical taming of the spirit who allegorically domesticates animals and the reptilian seats of Sunguz). The son or son-in-law must build dyadic ties with outsiders, using their language and their symbols of utility value. Llactas have territorial markers established by a powerful shaman during some act of acquisition of power. Perceived violations of such markers motivate men to aggressive action. Leaders in such action must be the strong young males, who have made contacts with people outside the territory. Such men become indigenous spokesmen and must interact with one another without conflict. But, these very men usually have been in active conflict with one another during some point of their early adult life, especially when lacta fisson took place, necessitating new alliances forming around an emergent powerful shaman. When selected, however, such men draw from the root paradigm in several ways to suppress their socioeconomical- ly derived political antagonism toward one another, to express ideological harmony among themselves and symbolic control of forces emanating from an outer world. Each man makes and carries with him a special preparation, which varies con- siderably, but always has the following ingredients, or analogs to them: amarun shungu, boa-anaconda heart-stomach (where its inner strength, or will, lies), signaling the en- compassing power of Sungui; red substances drawn from the mindal tree inner bark, an Amasanga hidden manifestation symbolizing the color of his sacharuna bancu; some powdered plant substance domesticated by Sacha chagra mama, a feminine A masanga image; and Bixa orellana, a Nunghui manifestation. It is also common to add a can- tarica (Staphylinidae) beetle which has the black-purple shimmering colors that are pro- totypic of both A masanga and Nunghui. Whether amarun shungu or some analog is used, preparation is always the same. It is placed in a pair of decorated chicha drinking bowls, one inverted in the other, and secretly buried for a year or more. The resulting fungus is called supai allpa, spirit earth-clay, and embodies the concept of transforma- tion. The hard, blue-black cantarica beetle, as simayuca mama, is seen as making the mixture inside the container "ferment" like chicha, also an expression of transformation, and the fungus itself is said to "blossom." The concept "blossoming" is also used to ex- press transformation: a bud is analogous to a soul stone; the blossom is the transforma- tion of the bud not only into something new (a flower), but into that which brings to it spirit helpers in the form of butterflies and bees (Whitten 1976a). In addition to preparation and possession of transformation substances symbolically promoting harmony, men in such situations emphasize mythical brotherhood. This con- cept is bound up in the myth of survival of the indigenous people after a great flood, out of which the sun emerged from the water. Humans, Runa, trekking back westward toward their ancient lands would, in hunger, pinch tree fungi/lichens which would cry out and turn into a "lost brother." Emphasis on common descent is added to that of mythic descent, in such contexts. Men refer to legendary "grandparents" who emerged more recently out of the chaos of war and turmoil at a period of depopulation to ex- change sons for sons in arranged marriages signaling new alliances, and to create a system whereby replication of kin class status would take place generations later. In such grandparental times, called apayaya rucunguna-apamama rucuguna, the ancestors regained lost knowledge from Amasanga (male referent) and Nunghui (female referent). Stones containing the souls of shamans aided the shaman males, those representing lost Lumu mama power aided the women. Men established territories, making pacts with the Jurijuri, and women called upon Nunghui for aid in making the manioc grow and in find- ing clay and rocks to create fine decorated pottery. When some threat to the actual forest-swidden-riparian system central to Canelos Quichua exploitation is perceived, two more things occur which bind the powerful shamans themselves to other antagonistic powerful shamans, solidifying the bonds of har-</page><page sequence="17">852 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 monic expression established by younger men by the manipulation of mystical substance, mythic descent, and legendary stipulated descent. Shamans introduce the subject of real, ramifying kin bonds, demonstrating filiation between each powerful shaman. As the young men discuss actual juropolitical strategies - e.g., going to see the governor of the province, making a trip to Quito (the national capital) to see responsible officials, talking to early colonists in the Puyo area with political sophistication in the region, visiting a military representative with years of service in the Oriente - the powerful shamans tell of an ancient custom. They say that, when the domain of the Sacha Runa-and here they clearly mean a range from spirit Amasanga to contemporary Runa -was threatened, the power of Sungui would be called forth. To do this a large wooden slit-gong representative of the great amarun would be made by a shaman, after taking ayahuasca and conversing with the Yacu supai runa through the mediation of Yacu mama. The gong would then be beaten for several days, while men sang songs and drank ayahuasca. The souls of enemies were thereby attracted and captured. After this an attack would be made to kill the in- vaders. As the shamans tell of this custom, women state that it was manalli, bad. The amarun gong (tunduli in Quichua, tundiii in Jivaro proper and Achuara), they say, called forth a power which invariably led to killing, and therefore retaliation by those who were attacked. As a result the calling forth of Sungui for aggressive action led to times of chaos and de- struction, and contributed to the indigenous loss of control of jungle and swidden re- sources. Young men, in such circumstances, listen to the elder men and women and talk of negotiation. They are bolstered, they say, by the older men's projected imagery of an ultimate territorial power pool based on the ability to call forth the encompassing water power system. Implicit in these discussions seems to be the idea of control of power: they may use it to destroy or they may suppress it to maintain sociocultural adaptability and survival. When shamans turn to the telling of such stories, they explicitly signal a setting aside of intershaman antagonistic duels. They affirm an end to their spirit projectile at- tacks and counterattacks, and a unity in common purpose. Such affirmation only occurs when there is a perceived "clear and present danger" of physical encroachment of out- siders into a designated jungle domain. I have documented one such incident elsewhere (Whitten 1976b). In the face of such a threat, shamans focus on the ability to bring forth the destructive power of master-image Sungui, while women talk of maintenance of forest and swidden resources, stressing the channeling of the power derived from Sungui's domain by preservation of the domains of Amasanga and Nunghui. Today, in the Puyo area, the root paradigm is continuously evoked in the face of the colonist encroachment as a Sacha Runa construct ideologically opposed to any na- tionalist design for incorporation of the Canelos Quichua into the Ecuadorian lower class. This does not mean that the Canelos Quichua socioeconomic maneuvers themselves always resist nationalist design, for indeed they do not. The paradigmatic quality of ecological imagery, combined with the specific breadth of ecosystem knowledge, pro- motes Canelos Quichua cultural versatility through a dual commonality of interests. This versatile duality, in turn, seems to further both cultural continuity and cultural adapt- ability. Whether or not the Canelos Quichua can effect the ecosystem transformation necessary to maintain an expanding population on diminishing territory with the con- tinuous pressures of a nationalist cultural obliteration policy'0 now constraining them through government officials is an open question, in my mind, and in theirs. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In many ways, the work of Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, quoted and cited at the outset of this paper, presaged the bypass of structuralist and materialist models and research</page><page sequence="18">Whitten] ECOLOGICAL IMAGERY IN ECUADOR 853 strategies leading to closure, and reaffirmed the role of ethnography in the process of theory construction. But his concept of "adaptive infrastructure" could also be taken to imply inevitable fragmentation of indigenous cosmology in the face of radical change. Ironically, perhaps, Reichel's very field setting of primary informant work, upon which the entire book Amazonian Cosmos was based, offers apparent refutation of this conclu- sion. His initial informant, Antonio Guzmin, was a multilingual, mission-educated, onetime soldier, resident of Bogota, who, with Reichel, worked out the "closed circuit" model of the "viable equilibrium," of Desana cosmology within the confines of Reichel's office at the Universidad de los Andes (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971:xiii-xiv). The issue here is not whether this is an appropriate way to conduct ethnography linking ecological and cosmological premises (see, e.g., Maybury-Lewis 1971:19-20). It is simply that, given the radical shifts in Guzmin's life, his very perception of cosmology based on paradigmatic structuring of ecosystem dynamics suggests cosmological adaptability, not rigidity leading to fragmentation. The endeavor to comprehend ecological, social, and political dynamics in a setting of rapid change should lead not only to an appreciation of the ecological theory and abstract philosophy evident in indigenous cosmology, but also to the metaphoric predica- tions on paradigmatic imagery which facilitate cognitive, social, economic, and political versatility in the face of change. Following Reichel, we have chosen not to view the Amasanga-Nunghui-Sungui paradigmatic imagery as a set of institutional allusions ex- pressed through native exegesis of social rules - a "masking superstructure." But neither have we dealt with the paradigm as a model of ecosystem adaptation within the confines of a closed nature-society-supernatural homeostatic system--an "adaptive infra- structure." The focus here is on the evocative, symbolic template which is anchored by shamanism and ceramic manufacture (for especially prominent examples) as this template provides a transformable set of metaphors for ritual and sociopolitical protest. The concept of protest itself refers both to the affirmation of strength and the resistance to destruction. James W. Fernandez (1969:5) productively discusses certain African religious movements which: ?. have been preoccupied with reaffirming themselves, not in protesting against the larger situation. To understand them as they exist for their members, they cannot be studied exclusively as the institutional creatures of a much larger context. They are interested primarily in microcosmogony - constructing a universe of their own in which to dwell - and not in changing the universe to which they may be reacting. Canelos Quichua protest contains both the properties of self (or culture) affirmation and those of selected resistance. Canelos Quichua cosmology is constructed out of the known and postulated dynamics of their Upper Amazonian rain forest-swidden-riparian ecosystem in such a manner that Amasanga-Nunghui-Sungui imagery promotes cultural change through continuity, continuity through change. The key to understanding is the cosmological flexibility in its basic paradigmatic nature which facilites, in both private and public symbolism, the dual commonality of interests expressed in terms of ecosystem knowledge and cultural coding." Metaphoric predication on paradigmatic structure perhaps provides the cognitive basis necessary to a new surge of coordinating activity (e.g., Adams 1975:210, 214ff) among a people confronted with a radically altered system of external control, or potential control, and imposed disorder. The study of Amazonian cosmology (or that of any other cosmology), I submit, is not furthered when we dichotomize our perspectives into those suggested by "masking superstructure" or "adaptive infrastructure." Understanding such material, especially in systems of rapid, cataclysmic change, may proceed through judicious ethnographic pro- cedures in which the search is for the metaphoric-metonymic correspondences, or codes, in mythic, ritual, and other cultural phenomena which allow multiple actors in various</page><page sequence="19">854 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 contexts to receive, frame, symbolize, and retransmit different social messages within specifiable ecologies. Today, in the moist tropics of South America, as elsewhere, it is essential to understand contemporary cosmological dynamics in terms of competing economies. By presenting aspects of the replicating correspondence structure of an indigenous root paradigm maintained, probably elaborated, and perhaps crystallized by a native tropical forest people undergoing rapid social change, I hope to draw attention to the inherent complementarity of cultural continuity and cultural change, and to the inherent com- plementarity of ecology and symbolism. NOTES A cknowledgments. This paper was prepared under the auspices of a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, the Center for Advanced Studies of the University of Illinois, and the Sacha Runa Research Foundation, Urbana. Funds supporting the research upon which the paper is based were largely provided by a grant from the National Science Foundation No. GS-2999, with sup- plemental funds from the University of Illinois, Urbana, through the Research Board, Center for International Comparative Studies, and the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Research was sponsored by the joint auspices of the Ecuadorian Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia and the Museo del Banco Central, both under the direction of Arq. Hernin Crespo Toral. I am indebted to Hernin Crespo Toral, in Quito, and toJoe Brenner, in Puyo, for their roles in facilitating fieldwork from 1970 through 1977. Paul Spangler of the Smithsonian Institution generously provided essential information on entomology during the summer of 1977 in eastern Ecuador. Dorothea S. Whitten, coinvestigator in this work, commented critically and constructively on various drafts, for which I am especially grateful. Edward M. Bruner and John O. Stewart also provided valuable critical comments on different drafts, leading to the necessary final revisions. The work of Donald W. Lathrap has contributed to my thinking about matters discussed in this paper, and the final result owes far more to the work of James W. Fernandez than is probably manifest through my citations to his publications. Among the many helpful native exegetes and research collaborators in the Canelos Quichua culture area, I must single out Marcelo Santi Simbafia, Faviola Vargas Aranda, Luis Antonio Vargas Canelos, Celia Santi, Julian Santi Vargas, Alberto Chango, Teresa Santi Maianchi, Juana Catalina Chango, and the late Virgilio Santi for their particularly valuable contribution to this study. I bear all responsibility, of course, for the final result. The paper was originally delivered, in abbreviated form, as part of the Symposium on "The Ecology of the Jivaroan Tribes," organized and chaired by Michael J. Harner at the 75th Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association, Washington, D.C., 1976. It was then modified after additional fieldwork among the Puyo Runa in December-February 1976-77, submit- ted to the American Anthropologist in late March 1977, and then again revised along lines recom- mended by outside readers' comments and on the basis of three more months of field research be- tween late April-mid-July, 1977. Orthography follows Orr and Wrisley (1965) as simplified by Whitten (1976a). 1 One anonymous reviewer strongly recommended that the reader's attention be drawn to previously published sources of our fieldwork situation, and to materials which allow me to con- dense aspects of cosmology and adaptation. Whitten (1976a:287-304) discussed the manner by which field data were collected in 1968, 1970, 1971, 1972-73, and goes into some detail on the rela- tionships obtaining between fieldworkers and Canelos Quichua peoples in settings of daily life, ritual enactment, and active protest within native hamlets, jungle settings, and within the national towns and villages of eastern Ecuador. Additional data have been derived from daily life as well as from highly charged emotional settings ranging from open indigenous conflict with Ecuadorian of- ficials to the death of many shamans and subsequent reorganization of internal structure. For a paper with a perspective congruent with this one see Drummond (1977). 2 Fernandez (1974:120) writes of "sign-image" in this way: Behind the shifting back and forth of the same token from signal to symbol lies the arresting sign- image, which, because of its power, its attractiveness, its vitality, is sorted out from the bloom</page><page sequence="20">Whitten] ECOLOGICAL IMAGERY IN ECUADOR 855 and buzz of experience and preserved in memory, rising again and again in dream or mythopoeic performance. 3 Firth (1975:14) defines paradigmatic structures as follows: Paradigmatic structures are essentially structures of ideas rather than structures of social relation- ships. As such, they can be conceived as having creative power for the actor. For the analyst, they appear to have a higher power of comparison and prediction through their more abstract, analogic quality. But sharp-edged instruments [he goes on to caution us] need more care in handling. Sometimes the notion of a paradigm is used in almost a mechanistic sense: one is given the impression of people being fitted out with portfolios of paradigms which encode their cir- cumstances and experiences - putting out the appropriate blueprint for use as occasions present themselves. I wish to be quite clear on my stance here. This is not the only paradigm which can be constructed from Canelos Quichua culture by me, or by native exegetes (or by our combined efforts). Due respect to contextuality in the elicitation of data, and repeated experience of Canelos Quichua life over more than a 25-month period, however, leads me to set forth this paradigmatic structure as a creative set of generalizations which provide a basis for intracultural coherence transcending con- textually specific behavior in the transmission of ideas and information. 4 Encyclopedic knowledge, according to Sperber (1975:91) "is about the world. It may be ex- pressed in the form of a set of synthetic propositions." Encyclopedic knowledge differs from seman- tic knowledge in that while "semantic knowledge about each category is finite" (Sperber 1975:92), "encyclopaedic knowledge about . . . categories is potentially infinite" (Sperber 1975:73). Sperber (1975:92) also states, "To the very extent that encyclopaedic knowledge is enriched, symbolic knowledge is able to take on new knowledge and similarly enrich itself." The reason for using Sperber's terminology here should become increasingly apparent. 5 There is a good deal of association here as regards the reptiles boa-anaconda which are classed together as amarun, distinguished when necessary as sacha amarun, boa, and yacu amarun, ancon- da (all boas have their special designated names, as well, but amarun as related to the paradigmatic structure is all that concerns us here). The boa is regarded as the vehicle by which Amasanga traverses the water domain. It is Amasanga's canoe on the water. The anaconda is Sungui's canoe, in which he rides under the water. The cayman is regarded as an ancient canoe which ran to the water having been cut as a tree from A masanga's domain, and which served as a mythic, sentient, "grandmother" canoe for ancient people on top of the water, and as a seat for Sungui under the water (see Whitten 1976:37-42). For a recent, extensive discussion of the Crocodilia and Sauria species and symbolism in neotropical cosmology, see Helms (1977:51-132). 6 This is but a small segment of mythological process, and a bit more information may be of in- terest. The most prominent aspect of the myth of Quilla-Jillucu brother-sister incest has to do with the common origin of the Canelos Quichua, which is enacted during the annual ceremonies (Whit- ten 1976a). Just as Nunghui andJilucu (the moon's Potoo sister-lover) can be equated, Genipa americana and Bixa orellana are also equated as sisters of the moon, and of Jilucu. Furthermore, in ceramic design the pasu fruit is often represented as a star and the pasu tree drawn so as to represent the star-like appearance of the first leaves of the pasu plant as they emerge from seed. All stars are regarded as sky humans, anthropomorphic sky animals or plants, or sky spirits. Stars which fall to earth in mythology either transform to two brothers on a river bank, or two caterpillars (analogous to Lumu mama) that transform into women. Before the coming of the sun, in mythology, celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies were the same, and were "human," but humans were not adult; they crawled on the ground and spoke only in two-tone hum. After the separation of night and day, sky and earth, "ancients" maintained contact by building sky ladders, called chaca, pinned into the sky by a pinduj, river cane, lance. With the end of the sky ladders, the under-earth became separated from the surface-earth. 7 In Sacha Runa (Whitten 1976a) I describe this somewhat differently, bringing in the under- world, Ucupacha, or Ucupachama (Ucu-down, pacha-earth). I now think that this concept of underworld is one which is syncretized from Andean concepts. After eight more months of field research, and much deeper experiences with the Canelos Quichua during some mystical crises such as the death of a powerful shaman and subsequent llacta reorganization, and the accompaniment</page><page sequence="21">856 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [80, 1978 of a particularly close indigenous collaborator and friend on two Datura quests, I now think that the "underworld" notion is secondary to the encompassing power of the water world, and so have chosen to eschew discussion of Ucupacha here. I might point out that the common Andean term pacha, earth, occurs in this form only with the notion of ucupacha, and that its normal form is the metathesis chapaj, which translates as mire (wetter than turu, mud). Chapaj is conceived of as useless wet clay underlying pottery clay and garden soil; there is also an association with death. 8 One can gloss shungu with the English concept "will," especially in terms of Webster's New World Dictionary sense of "volition," "inclination," "strong purpose, intention," "power of self direction or self control," "disposition of attitude toward others," "influence or control (over others)." 9 The full name of the organization commonly called the Federaci6n Shuar, in Ecuador, is the Federaci6n de Centros Shuar, the statutes of which were formally established 12 January 1964. With headquarters in the frontier town of Suc(ia, the Federation, together with the Salesian Evangelical Mission to Ecuador, endeavors to expand the juropolitical franchise of all Shuar peoples, including ancient enemies such as the Achuara and Canelos Quichua. The Federation has developed, among other things, a board of directors with elected officials, a system of loans for cat- tle acquisition and raising, a radio station, publication series, and scholarship fund. This is without a doubt the most powerful indigenous organization in contemporary South America. (See, for a re- cent description and analysis, Salazar 1977.) 10 Whitten (1976a, 1976b, in press) discusses these policies and practices through 1973 when in- digenous affairs in the Puyo area were relegated to one ministry, while the affairs of colonists were relegated to another. In 1974 all indigenous affairs in this region were transferred to the Ministry of Cattle and Agriculture. The current agronomists and engineers in charge of "civilizing" the Puyo Runa, and other aggregations of Canelos Quichua culture, state quite frankly that the worth of the native peoples will be determined with respect to their marketable products. They also work in- cessantly to withhold the requested infrastructural support which would allow a marketing of in- digenous produced subsistence and cash products even though the demand for such products is soaring. SThe integration of any commonality of interests expressed symbolically requires a view of sym- bols themselves which is not restricted by semantic or grammatical analysis. This is presumably the point which both Fernandez (1974:130, 131) and Sperber (1975) are making. Fernandez (1974:130) writes: In the study of [associations that rest upon mediation or latent functions] . . . we come to a better understanding of the overall progress made by a paradigm of metaphors than can be obtained through a study of dialectical structures of contrast relations. Sperber argues vigorously against the encompassment of symbolism by semiotics. He endeavors to dislodge Levi-Strauss from his own theoretical underpinnings, while preserving the basis of structural analysis: when we strip the work of LUvi-Strauss of the semiological burden with which he has chosen to encumber it, we will then realise that he was the first to propose the fundamentals of an analysis of symbolism which was finally freed from the absurd idea that symbols mean (Sperber 1975:84).
