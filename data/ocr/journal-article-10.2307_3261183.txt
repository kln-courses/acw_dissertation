<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Biblical Literature The Septuagint Translation of the Hebrew Terms in Relation to God in the Book of Jeremiah, by Bernard M. Zlotowitz, with an introductory essay by Harry M. Orlinsky, "On Anthropomorphisms and Anthropopathisms in the Septuagint and Targum." New York: Ktav, 1981. Pp. xxv+196. $20. This work is based on the author's dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Hebrew Letters at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, New York, 1974. The dissertation was written under the direction of Prof. Harry M. Orlinsky, whose introductory essay is a necessary part of the book because it describes the background of the work and the framework within which the author operated. The issue under investigation is the question as to how Hebrew words (not "terms") used in the Bible in relation to God are translated into Greek. The author's special interest is to examine whether anthropomorphic and anthropopathic words used in relation to God are rendered literally or are avoided. This investigation must be viewed in the wider context of the literature on this subject, which is reviewed by Orlinsky in the introductory essay. There are some anti-anthropomorphic renderings in the Pentateuch, but in the words of Fritsch, they are "disappointingly few" (C. T. Fritsch, The Anti-Anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch [Princeton: Prince- ton University, 1943] 15). Yet the very title of Fritsch's book, as well as the examples collected by him, contributed to a false impression, which has been created in the literature, of a frequent occurrence of this phenomenon in the LXX. Orlinsky thus quotes several studies by himself, his students M. H. Hurwitz, A. Soffer, and P. M. Aronson, and by T. Wittstruck, in order to show that anthropomorphisms and - pathisms were, as a rule, not avoided in the LXX. The present study must be viewed within the framework of that discussion, and its conclusions are similar to those of the aforementioned scholars. In the author's own words (p. 183): "The data throughout this thesis have profusely demonstrated that the Septuagint translator(s ?) of the book of Jeremiah reproduced literally and correctly the Hebrew terms related to God." The author's conclusions are based on a minute discussion of all the "physical and human attributes of God" (p. xiii). These attributes are subdivided as follows: (I) Human attributes of God, (A) anthropomorphisms such as yad, qbl, (B) anthropo- pathisms such as 'ahab hemi, (C) psychological terms, leb, ruah, (D) other human characteristics ascribed to God, such as hasab, yada'. (II) Physical and other acts associated with God, such as 'bd, 'sp, 'rr (in order to give a better background for the description of the translation equivalents, the examples in this chapter are subdivided into those favorable and those unfavorable [to Israel], together with a general category). (III) God's holy abodes. (IV) God in terms of family relationships (subdivided into marriage, husband, father, divorce). The main part of the book consists of a detailed discussion of the renderings of physical and human attributes of God. In the great majority of instances the author shows how the Hebrew words under discussion have been rendered "literally," such as zerba'-brachion or epicheiron, yad-cheir, nepes-psyche. In all these instances, the "literalness" of the translation demonstrates that the translator did not avoid this particular type of description. In a relatively small number of cases, however, the translation deviated from MT. These have not been collected by the author in a special chapter nor have they been listed, but the reader encounters these instances while reading through the work. 314</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Some of these deviations are attributed to a different Hebrew Vorlage (espe- cially a shorter one). These cases are not discussed in the work as they do not bear on the translator's techniques; this applies, e.g., to some occurrences of 'orep (p. 12), panim (p. 14), me'al panay (p. 15), lipne (p. 16), 'ap (pp. 29-32), ka'as (p. 40), niham (p. 44), etc. In other instances, when the deviation in the translation was intentional, the possibility of an anti-anthropomorphism is seriously discussed. How- ever, no cases of anti-anthropomorphism or -pathism in the translation have been recognized by Zlotowitz. Every instance which could be explained as such is ascribed to the author's "style," "Greek idiom," or "free" translation, as, for example, 'ayin- enantion (p. 11), qbl-logos (pp. 22-25), be'appeka-en thymQ, (p. 27), silahti-ou me mnesthesomai (p. 47). According to this reviewer, the author has proved his point with the examples provided in the book, and he has thus contributed to the internal analysis of the LXX, which is significant in its own right. On the basis of Zlotowitz's book, it can be said safely that the translator of Jeremiah usually did not shrink from literal translation of physical and human attributes of God. However, this is not to say that the translator did not occasionally avoid such renderings, as he also indulged occasionally in unstereotyped renderings in other areas. The data given in the book do not provide such examples, but it should be con- ceded that the material is not complete. The author remarks in the Introduction (p. xiii) that he excluded bo' and zkr ("a preliminary study indicated that they have nothing significant to contribute to the problem") as well as many other words. However, I am not certain that the rendering of these and other words should be excluded from this study, for reflections or avoidance of anthropomorphic renderings could be present in the rendering of any word or construction, even in small grammatical details. I further suggest that an investigation like Zlotowitz's should be based on a slightly broader foundation on all "Hebrew terms in relation to God," as suggested by the name of the book, but not implemented in the book itself. Such an investigation would concentrate on all aspects of the translator's approach to God, as it were, on the translator's theology, although I do not like that term. Within the light of such a larger analysis of Jeremiah some renderings come to mind in which the translator did deviate from the plain sense of his parent text. I am reminded of Jer 2:29 lama tiribfi 'Pely (Why do you complain against me?)-hina ti laleite pros me (Why do you speak to me?). Both in this verse and in the next example, God is the object of the rib: 12:1 ki 'arib 'eleyk--hoti apologesomai pros se. The second example shows that in the first one the translator did not think of tedabberu instead of tiribi, as is often suggested, but that he avoided speaking of a "complaint" against God. Another example which comes to mind is sa'arat (literally: a storm of God) rendered as seismos para kyriou in 23:19 (but as orge kyriou in 30(37):23). The translator may have wished to disassociate God from the tempest by adding para. However, these remarks refer to an investigation broader than that of Zlotowitz. Realizing from my own work on Jeremiah that this investigation will not yield many such examples, I note again that Zlotowitz's results are, in my view, basically correct. I should like to add that the reader would have expected a more extensive introduction outlining the basic problems as well as introductory statements to each category, a detailed statement on the lack of relevance (according to the author) of text-critical problems (mainly minuses) to the issue under investigation, and some clarifications with regard to matters of translation technique. (It is not sufficient to 315</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Biblical Literature describe most translation equivalents simply as "literal" or "correct," but the author should have stated what the use of these terms implies.) Finally, the concluding remarks should have been more extensive (possibly with statistics) with regard to the author's classifications of the renderings. He should also have given some results of his subdivision of the material into "favorable" and "unfavorable" (do the results justify the need for such a subdivision?). If the author agrees with these remarks, some details can be added in a second edition. In any event, they do not distract from Zlotowitz's detailed and significant contribution to the study of the LXX. Last but not least, Ktav should be compli- mented for producing a typographically beautiful book. Emanuel Tov The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel Auf den Spuren der Beter: Einfuhrung in die Psalmen, by Hans Seidel. Arbeits- biicher fur die Aus- und Weiterbildung kirchlicher Mitarbeiter. Berlin: Evangelische Verlagsanstalt, 1980. Pp. 180. DDRM 5.60 (paper). Seidel has prepared a fine and useful handbook for the study of the Psalms. Apparently designed for use in the church, it gives the reader a broad introduction into most of the important features in the study of the Psalms, such as the genres of the Psalms, their poetic character, their history and character as a collection, and their relation to worship and cult. These subjects are handled briefly but carefully enough to provide the important data. Seidel draws upon the secondary literature but avoids extensive debate with modern scholars. His attention is focused primarily on the Psalms themselves, and there are many interpretive insights on particular Psalms, although only Psalm 133 is given extended exegetical treatment (as an illustrative example of interpretation at the conclusion of the book). In a chapter on the theology of the Psalms, Seidel focuses upon the presence of God experienced in the cult and expressed in the hymns with the imagery of king, judge, most high God, and creator; the saving activity of God in hesed and 'emet, in past and future, and through the messiah and the law; the reality of God's involve- ment in life and death, blessing and curse; and the experience of human beings before God as individual and community, righteous and unrighteous, poor and pious, sinner and redeemed. The final two chapters present a brief history of interpretation of the Psalter, and a summary of various approaches to interpreting the Psalms that have been adopted at various times, i.e., historical, eschatological,, christological (including typological), allegorical, and historical-critical. He concludes with some suggestions of his own about how one may go about interpreting the Psalms. Like the rest of this volume, these are not novel, but they are useful. Patrick D.
