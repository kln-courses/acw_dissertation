<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRENCH REVIEW, Vol. LVI, No. 1, October 1982 Printed in U.S.A. Implications of the Love Debate in L'Astree by Laurence A. Gregorio LITTLE ENTHUSIASM REMAINS IN OUR DAY for the text of L'Astree in its entirety. As a function of its great length, the novel has taken on the aspect of a literary dinosaur. After all, it spans several thousand pages, and one can do little to avoid an initial impression that, having read only a few episodes, he has seen essentially all there is to see. Consequently, literary history has handed down many gener- alities concerning the work. Some of these may be accurate; one of them, namely, the common understanding about the text's debate on love, does not prove to be so reliable. I propose to redefine the locus and the implications of this debate. It would be at best a formidable task to impart a concise context for any facet of the novel: the narrative is populated by scores of characters, most of whom are inveterate storytellers in their own right. However, our attention need be directed to only a few of these. One obvious and constant line of action involves the efforts of the noble-shepherd Celadon to regain the alienated affections of his beloved, Astree. This central quest is intertwined with several others, incorporated in other major figures. First there is Silvandre, a shepherd of obviously lofty (but unknown) ancestry, who is in perennial search of his true identity. Then there is Adamas, the chief druid, central authority figure, and moral spokesman. Finally for our purposes there is Hylas, the irrepressible harlequin who is at once a jester and a rebel against social mores. Pastoral romances, this one included, are built on tales of loves lost and found. Hence the centrality of the Celadon-Astr6e relationship. But the novel is not the love saga of these two characters alone: virtually all youthful characters (as well as some older ones) are involved in separate love stories of their own. When they are not acting out these stories, or listening to them as recounted by a number of secondary narrators, the characters do little other than theorize on the nuances of love. In fact, even the political intrigue that unfolds in L'Astree is caused in part by romantic interests. The most cursory reading of the text shows that love is far and away the principal motivation of action and the preponderant motif in dialogue. It is no wonder that love is the topic of much of the research that has been done on the work to date.1 Given this exalted status of love in the text, it is generally assumed that L'Astree Love is given lengthy consideration by Henri Bochet, " L'Astree: ses origines, son importance dans la formation de la litt6rature classique," Diss. Geneva 1923. See also Maurice Magendie, L'Astree: analyse et extraits (Paris: Perrin, 1928). The most detailed and enlightening work on the subject is that of Jacques Ehrmann, Un Paradis desespere: l'amour et l'illusion dans L'Astree (New Haven and Paris: Yale University Press and Presses Universitaires de France, 1963). 31</page><page sequence="2">embodies a fully articulated, platonic philosophy on the subject. Such an inference is indeed tempting in light of the many serious discussions on love that are related in the narrative. Moreover, d'Urfe's grounding in Plato is quite evident in all his writings. However, the study of Clifton Cherpack goes far to discourage the interpretation of L'Astree as a didactic work.2 The compelling argument that Cherpack puts forth is that too many ideological inconsistencies remain unre- solved for the text to be read as a cogent philosophical treatise. The fact is that characters do strike a sententious pose as they speak on matters of the heart; the point is that many issues of debate are left at the level of paradox for lack of a definitive resolution. I shall take this argument one step further by demonstrating how this thematic paradox is borne out on other levels of the text. It would seem that any considerations of the love debate in L'Astr6e should begin with the free-thinking Hylas, the only character of major stature who espouses and propagates a code of conduct thoroughly opposed to the socially accepted norm of constancy. So rigid and otherwise uncontested is the latter that Hylas, for his liberality, remains at the fringe of the pastoral society, just as he is barred from entering Celadon's temple of love (II, 178).3 On numerous occasions Hylas engages in open debate with Silvandre, the main exponent of the pastoral society's codified and almost chivalrous standards. As Hylas eloquently flouts the conventions, these scenes provide most, if not all, of the levity that is to be found in the novel. Therein lies a problem. How can it be that in L'Astr6e, a work that elsewhere accords total seriousness to the ontology and subtleties of love, a true debate on the topic is allowed to run its course in such a setting? This question arises from a careful consideration of the facts. First, the views of Hylas are simply too extreme to be taken seriously by society, especially in the context of the more serious action that provides the basic material of the narrative. Indeed, Hylas is never seen by his peers as mounting a real challenge to their status quo. Then again, neither Hylas nor Silvandre ever attempts to resolve the radical differences between them, so their redundant discussions cannot well be construed as bona fide exchanges on weighty issues. On the other hand, a clear pattern develops in the course of these almost ritualistic encounters between Hylas and Silvandre. What we see emerging is not a concrete philosophy of love, but rather a kind of theater of rhetoric, destined for the general divertissement and consistently ending in general merriment. Hylas plays the role of entertainer, not philosopher, in his society. Consequently, if this were the only exchange on the nature and ethics of love, the parodic aspect alone of this forum would serve to undermine the interpretation of L'Astree as an essentially ideological treatise. These polemics do, of course, stand out in the reader's eye if only because they 2 Clifton Cherpack, "Form and Ideas in L'Astr6e," Studies in Philology, 69, (1972). 3 Honore d'Urfe, L'Astree, ed. H.

But the incessant sparring that goes on between Hylas and Silvandre is much more a part of a semiological process of character identification than any kind of philosophical argument.4 And again, a careful consideration of the facts brings the problem to a deeper level, for the genuine ideological confrontation on love is conducted in a rather unlikely place. The assertion of views that actually resembles a serious debate involves Silvandre, as one might expect, since this character is called upon time and again to theorize and to instruct on the proprieties of love. The other participant is Adamas, the chief druid and, as noted above, society's main voice of conscience. Any disparity of belief between two such honnetes hommes would be striking to the reader, but that the issue of love is in question lends particular significance to the fact. Given all that we have observed on the centrality of the love motif, we might presuppose total harmony among characters who systematically side with the Good and the heroic. Nonetheless, this discord between Silvandre and Adamas is noticeable even though the two men never confront each other at any point with opposing views: the text seems careful to set the debate as an indirect exchange of conflicting opinions; moreover, none of the other characters even shows an awareness of the differences. But the reader can be aware. In any event, and for reasons about to be made clear, this "debate" too goes without an ultimate resolution. Much to the dismay of a reader seeking a uniform philosophical stance in a text so preoccupied with love, two authoritative speakers disagree significantly on the matter. Both Silvandre and Adamas do stand as authorities, as thinkers and "reasoners" of justice. They are equally recognized and heeded as positive voices for society's ethical system. On the one hand, Silvandre derives his competence to pronounce on love from his extensive education in the "escholes des Phocenses Massiliens"-an unimpeachable source of certification, as virtually everyone attests. As for Adamas, druid and principal spokesman on earth for the deities, he justifiably assumes the authority to speak on all facets of life, including love. Of course, the austerity and sincerity of each of these two characters serve to set the tone of serious discussion, indicating by the same token that this is where the real debate will occur. But in light of the impeccable qualifications of the participants, and in view of the fact that both remain unwaveringly on the side of the heroic, a dichotomy between them will point necessarily to an inconsistency in society's ideological foundation. One might here challenge an analysis of ideological inconsistencies in L'Astree on the grounds that we are admittedly dealing not with a philosophical treatise, but with a novel. It is, after all, a fictional text in which Silvandre and Adamas are depicted as fallible, in spite of their great erudition. Nevertheless, the two characters do function as philosophers within their fictional society and hence should be studied with regard to this function. Furthermore, the areas in which 4 See my doctoral dissertation, "The Character Under the Mask: Disguise and Identity in L'Astree," Diss. University of Pennsylvania 1980. 33</page><page sequence="4">they philosophize are crucial to the formulation of the heroic code-the set of values that is of prime importance to all but a very few antagonistic characters. In considering the dialogic nature of much of the narrative, we also find that, in general, debate and ideological confrontation are matters of thematic import. At any rate, disharmony will have important semiological implications for those characters who are striving to grasp and identify meanings in a field that remains obscure. Silvandre and Adamas do share common premises for their respective ideas on love: that it is a function of the soul, not of the body, and that the spiritual is distinct from, and superior to, the corporal; that love results from the "sympathie" of souls, proceeding from the soul's instinct to pursue that which it perceives as good and beautiful; that true love can only occur among spiritual (and a fortiori social) equals, and that it must be bound by the terms which Nature has imposed on individuals; that reason necessarily plays a role in love; and, finally, that le desir (which we must understand as a euphemism for lust) has no place in proper love since, as an appetite, it has no permanence. Beyond these points, the two characters disagree remarkably. Adamas holds to a theocentric ontology of love. He argues that God created the universe out of love, and that man has been given the faculty of reason, which teaches him to love God in His creatures. Since love is the divine ruling principle of existence, it is, in Adamas' words, "the best of all things" and should itself be cherished above all else-even, as is clearly implied, above the object of love (III, 217-18). Thus the ideal of love, as a manifestation of God, is of prime significance to Adamas, who views perfection as a divine characteristic. On the contrary, Silvandre's ontology of love is an anthropomorphic system. His argument stems from what he calls the first commandment of love: "that the lover believe all things very perfect in the person loved" (II, 388), a view of perfection as a human characteristic. Love, he says, is its own center, having no designs that do not begin and end in itself (II, 262), thus giving rise to his repeated assertion that the goal of the lover is to become the beloved by uniting his soul and will to hers. He explicitly chooses the term adorer over idolatrer regarding his own beloved (III, 506), stating that he adores her as he would a goddess. Hence his perennial point that the lover should cherish the beloved (within the code of proper love, of course) above all else, idealizing the object of love rather than its abstraction. The disparity goes further: both Adamas and Silvandre state that true love is in harmony with reason, but they do not agree on the role of the latter. Adamas, for his part, sees reason as the ruling principle and teacher in love. He proposes that love is born of reason since this faculty, guided by an astrological notion of "l'intelligence de la planete," creates an image of the ideal beloved (III, 263-64); it is this image that is in turn the basis of the theory of "sympathie" mentioned above. From this perspective Adamas advises a certain Corilas to marry non point par amour, mais par raison. Celle-la estant une des plus importantes actions, que vous puissiez jamais faire, et de laquelle tout l'heur et tout le mal-heur d'un homme peut dependre. (I, 194) 34 FRENCH REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">IMPLICATIONS OF THE LOVE DEBATE IN L'ASTREE Silvandre argues, however, that for the lover, the only happiness possible is through love (e.g., III, 506-19); and he thus sees the faculty of reason as the source of the code of proper conduct in love, not as the source of love itself. From this standpoint he counsels the lover to love "extremement," necessitating an abdica- tion of the individual's will (I, 287) and, at the same time, implicitly severing the code of love from its rational basis. Reason is here relegated to a secondary and supporting role, as a logical consequence of Silvandre's first argument that love represents a circle closed upon itself. A third topic of contention is even more revealing, for it pertains to more affective attitudes on the issue in debate. Nothing could be more clear in the pronouncements of Adamas than his perception of love as having two aspects, one good and the other evil. All the while extolling the inherent positive value of love, he does not hesitate to use his role as secondary narrator to recount stories of its possible negative effects;5 he speaks often of the "trahisons" of love (e.g., I, 379), repeatedly characterizing Cupid as furtive and potentially dangerous. He makes no qualitative distinction between these two facets of love, other than that one is laudable while the other is not: they are considered as merely two manifestations of the same phenomenon. Adamas' ideological system thus makes provisions for cases of misguided or errant love, recognizing them as consubstan- tial with the more positive instances. From an opposing side, however, the only love of which Silvandre speaks is that which he refers to as true love. As a result, he consistently regards it as a uniquely positive force with the functions of purifying the soul and rendering it more perfect. It is true that in his many disputes with the renegade Hylas, Silvandre takes exception to his adversary's protestations of "love." Nonetheless he forever sidesteps the issue of negativity by refusing to denote Hylas' drives as love, calling them instead by any of a host of other names: "outrecuidances," "extravagances," and the like. Unwilling to dignify imperfections in this matter by elevating them (if only lexically) to the plane of love, Silvandre reserves the latter term for a spiritual relationship, namely, that "sympathie" of souls, which can only be good and proper by its very definition. This particular aspect of the love debate, the opposition over the issue of negativity, seems to be borne out on the level of action in the text. Silvandre sees no evil in the world but rather only on the level of ideology, that is to say, in what he perceives as errors in logic. He remains a theorist and, fittingly, he is not reported to participate in society's military battles and political imbroglios. Conversely, Adamas does identify evil characters as such, and he does recognize the presence of evil in the world; as a result, he assumes a position of political and military prominence in order to deal with it by those means and on those levels. The divergence in characterization thus falls into line with a more universal generation gap: that which, throughout the novel, separates the idealism of the young from the pragmatism of their elders. In view of this particular, sustained opposition between the two characters, it is consistent that Adamas hold to a theory of love as a dynamic phenomenon, a 5 See Adamas' "Histoire de Damon et de Fortune" (I, 441-52). 35</page><page sequence="6">combination of action (in and of reason) and reaction (an effect of "sympathie"). On the other hand, Silvandre's view predictably envisions a more static entity, a reaction on the part of the lover or, in his own words, "un accident ... de mon ame" (III, 508)-that soul which is irresistibly attracted to what it recognizes as perfect. The differences that come between Silvandre and Adamas are thus of an ideological nature, pertaining to a phenomenon that no character in the text fully understands. In the absence of such definitive understanding, characters seek spiritual guidance from the two authorities whom we have isolated for study, as well as from the gods (through oracles) or from each other. Interpreting the dicta of these sources proves to be, as we have begun to demonstrate, quite another matter, which raises disturbing problems for the text's fictional society. This gap of understanding necessarily directs the critic's attention to the very complex processes of signification and interpretation that govern the characters' thoughts and deeds in the novel. It is in this sphere of activity, the processes of communi- cation and meaning, that the ideological inconsistencies have their broadest implications. Until now, I have presented evidence that calls for an assessment of the love debate in L'Astree. I have shown how the text's two great thinkers disagree significantly in three cases on the ontology of love. Yet both possess impeccable qualifications to pronounce on the matters at hand, and both speak in unques- tionably good faith. Furthermore, it is clear that Silvandre and Adamas each embody a heroic and positive set of values as much as any other character in the work. But despite these bonds, and despite their community of interest, they engage in a subtle argument in absentia over the one issue that most preoccupies their society as a whole. Without the benefit of face-to-face confrontation, this debate affords no definitive resolution. I shall therefore address both the impli- cations of this fact as well as those of the debate itself. There are broad hints through the course of the novel's first four volumes (and confirmation of these hints in Baro's fifth volume) that Silvandre, whose true identity has been a mystery even to himself, is actually the long-lost son of Adamas. It is discovered, for example, that Silvandre bears the druidic imprint of the "Rameau du Guy" on his arm (IV, 96). The nature of this sign, both in the meaning it bears for society and in its role as a conventional device of recognition, lends added interest to Silvandre's quest for his identity. That he turns out to be the son of Adamas gives yet another dimension of importance to the love debate I have examined. What, then, can be said of the theoretical differences that separate the two in spite of the strong bonds between them? Certainly the disparity is substantial on the ideological level, especially in light of society's overriding propensity to theorize about the nuances of love. The crucial point is not the degree of disparity; rather, it is that the two characters disagree at all. In the final analysis, the writer could conceivably have chosen any other character to take a position contrary, in any measure, to that of Adamas. Yet in the text it is none other than Silvandre, the son, who does this. 36 FRENCH REVIEW</page><page sequence="7">IMPLICATIONS OF THE LOVE DEBATE IN L'ASTREE The narrative makes their latent kinship a matter of thematic import and intrigue, as is always the case with analogous situations in pastoral romances. Here the significance of kinship goes beyond that of simple anagnorisis. Heredity is, after all, consistently depicted as all-important in the textual society's system of values: one is at least supposed to be as one is born. In many instances, of course, the opposite turns out to be true: numerous characters are born into roles that do not befit their true ancestral worth, but that they steadfastly maintain out of deference to some other "natural" order. Be that as it may, Silvandre at least poses throughout the novel as a kind of extension of Adamas. We have already enumerated the moral, theoretical, and functional affinities that bind the two. Further, according to the assumed social codes, Silvandre's filial bond (latent or otherwise) associates him more closely to Adamas in our eyes. The combination of all these factors posits a relationship of similarity between the two characters that is subsequently undermined by the love debate. Hence the first conclusion to be drawn from this debate: given the participants' identity of blood and common set of values, any disagreement whatever-regardless of its scope or intensity-is tantamount to self-contradiction in the heroic code. Accustomed as we may be to seeking homogeneity in literary works, such an inference can indeed be unsettling. The study of these discussions on love in L'Astree raises some interesting questions. What implications may be seen in the considerable oppositions that emerge from those indirect, but pointed, exchanges between Silvandre and Adamas? Are these and other self-contradictions and unresolved debates mere accidents, attributable to lapses in the author's memory and hence devoid of meaning? Or could they be significant components in a larger structural system of paradoxes? One possible reconciliation of these divergent interpretations lies in the notion of generic convention (see Cherpack). But if we examine the text itself, we may observe further that ambiguities are not without consequence to the text's own structure. They have correlatives on the levels of characterization and social organization, and even on the level of narrative structure, where the habitually omniscient narrator sometimes toys with selective knowledge (e.g., II, 204-5). In very general terms, and generic considerations notwithstanding, a careful reading of the text points up a consistently paradoxical plan of construction: on the levels mentioned, complex processes of signification are painstakingly assembled, yet the text includes some inherent means to discredit those very processes. Let us set forth one example to make the point. Virtually all characters place great importance on the proper identification of persons according to the social hierarchy. But without exception, they show themselves at one time or another to be incapable of reading signs of identity-hence the proliferation of disguises and the frequent misinterpretation of characters' true intentions. The latter may be topoi of the romance tradition, but this same process of identification is further confused by peculiarities of ancestry disguised: many members of the shepherd class, we are repeatedly told, occupy this inferior social stratum in spite of their descent from the noblest of families. In addition to this, the ready means of disguise enable hero and villain alike to create illusions across the supposedly 37</page><page sequence="8">intransigent social demarcations. It comes as no surprise, then, that characters encounter difficulties in reading social signs, since these signs are unreliable by virtue of a striking fact, namely, that a social order is carefully defined and, at the same time, its meaning is subverted.6 A semiological interpretation of the love debate in L'Astree will lead us to similar conclusions. The world of the novel is, as Jacques Ehrmann would put it, "a paradise in despair," but we make this judgment for reasons different from those that Ehrmann argues. He seems to ascribe this hopelessness to an irrecon- cilable tension between the concrete and the abstract, that is, between "instinctive" love and an uncompromising compulsion to spiritualize that love.7 But this explanation does not account for that ideological inconsistency which, as my discussion shows, is subtly built into the text's discourse on love. If love proves to be a futile endeavor in L'Astree, it is also because society's understanding of that phenomenon which it so values is ambiguous and inconsis- tent. While theoretical agreement about the nature and conduct of love would not solve all of society's semiological problems, it would provide a common denom- inator of communication and thus obviate the many misconceptions that drive lovers apart. However, as is eminently clear in the text's action, stability in love remains an impossible dream: in conjunction with the fact that there is no solid ideological foundation, no area of reference upon which to construct a reliable system of signification in matters of love, none of the novel's many lovers is able to interpret accurately the actual signs of love. To complicate the issue further, they create new, provisional systems of meaning based on illusion-disguises, role playing, etc.-while the guarantee of an a priori metaphysical truth remains in a state of uncertainty. In keeping with a larger pattern of ambiguity, a pattern that seems much more a structural rule than an exception in L'Astree, the love debate between Silvandre and Adamas is conducted in a forum of indirect exchange. Certainly a direct confrontation would be too pointed. Still, the text in its totality can only be understood fully if such paradoxes are read not as flaws, but as structural elements participating in a broad system that challenges its own processes of meaning. With this in mind, we may appreciate L'Astree as quite intent on leaving unresolved those ambiguities that, unfortunately, have vexed its critics for cen- turies. For this enigmatic text, I am proposing a new reading, one that endeavors to integrate a principle of ambiguity as a central structuring device. Taking duplicity of meaning into account, instead of casting it aside, would appear to be the preferred approach to a work that includes it on so many levels. The question of signification then becomes capital, as we are inevitably drawn back to the notion of meaning in the text's fictional society. How these characters-thinkers, lovers, narrators-construct systems of signs is the matter of importance, for society is engaged in a quest, not primarily for love, but for meaning. 6 Adamas himself commits a glaring self-contradiction in this regard, once decrying the very notion of mesalliance (I, 368), and later arguing explicitly in its favor (III, 628). 7 Ehrmann, pp. 15-16. 38 FRENCH REVIEW</page><page sequence="9">IMPLICATIONS OF THE LOVE DEBATE IN L'ASTREE Throughout the novel, there are systems of signs that are virtually taken for granted on the surface, yet are subtly undermined at the same time. In the area of characterization, so few characters are as they seem to be that the whole process of character identification may be called into question: shepherds are really nobles, some nobles are really villains, other characters labor under false identities, and so on. Even on the presentational level we see a narrator who plays games in his discourse. For example, with an overt wink of the eye, he attributes feminine grammatical forms to men who are disguised as women, and vice versa. Similar confusions in communication are to be found, predictably, in thematic outlay and in plot-from the ubiquitous opposition between essence and appearance to the problem of love that I have isolated for study here. On all these levels, the same occurrence is to be observed: the area of reference (which may already be unclear) is obscured by a misleading sign. Upon an unsteady ideological foundation, society attempts to construct a system in which the realities of love can find reliable expression, that is, an expression whose meaning can be grasped consistently and with accuracy by the intended receiver (or by society, or by the reader). That love exists is a foregone conclusion to these characters, who readily accept it and are sensitive to its forces. However, without a clear and consistent understanding of the nature and conduct of love, the characters are left with the problem of devising unambiguous signs. This is necessarily a problem since the area of reference for these signs, namely, society's collective conceptualization of love, is fraught with ambiguity from the start. It is clear that love is codified in this society: certain actions have certain values. But when these signs point to more than one possible meaning, and hence can be misunderstood, complications invariably arise. Lovers part, alienated from each other by a mutual inability to interpret. A guarantee of meaning, an assurance that signs can effect unambiguous communication-such certainty on the metaphysical plane is not forthcoming to the text's characters. With regard to matters of love, this conclusion is evident in the present study. The same conclusion may be projected over other facets of the work, from society's theology (focussed on a tri-partite God whose nature is explicitly left a mystery, II, 323-27) to the means by which this deity speaks to man (that is, obscure oracles whose signifying processes tend to pose ambiguities too difficult for the characters to understand). Multiple meaning is a trait of communication in L'Astree for the gods, the characters, and even the narrator at times. Thus social structure and characterization in the novel may be more fully understood as sign systems that, having no metaphysical basis for communication, have not resolved their confusions. Such a reading paves the way to an under- standing of the text as it is, not as it might be if its structure of paradoxes were ignored. UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, DENVER 39</page></plain_text>
