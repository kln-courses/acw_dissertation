<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jane Simpson IO AS SUPREME BEING: INTELLECTUAL COLONIZATION OF THE MAORI? By 1924 ethnographers had completed the intellectual colonization of the most tantalizingly elusive aspect of Maori society: their inner beliefs on ultimate questions. Captain James Cook was the first to claim, following the voyage of the Endeavour (1768-71), that the Maori believed in a "Supream God," as yet unnamed.1 A vast corpus has since been created on "Io" as the Supreme Being of the "neolithic" Maori, in no small part through the apparently authoritative publications in the 1920s of pioneer- ing New Zealand ethnologist and Polynesian Society cofounder, Elsdon Best. Best's anthropological triumph regarding Io as Supreme Being would be rehearsed again and again by international scholars wishing to prove an Urmonotheismus, a "primitive" monotheism, which in turn proved to 1 As given in J. C. Beaglehole, ed., The Voyage of the Endeavour, 1768-1771, vol. 1 of The Journals of Captain James Cook, 4 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1955), p. 286. Accounts of Cook's three successive voyages were published in 1771, 1777, and 1781, respectively. According to Beaglehole, both the Admiralty manuscript (Adm 55/ 40, Public Record Office, London) and the Greenwich manuscript (National Maritime Mu- seum, Greenwich) observed the silence surrounding the name of the "Supream God." The Mitchell manuscript (Mitchell Library, Sydney) has inserted in the blank space "Tawney," whom Beaglehole reads as "Tane." However, with the benefit of a wealth of accumulated Io material at his fingertips, Beaglehole fills in the gap with "Io," citing Sir Peter Buck and "that great scholar and charming writer" (Beaglehole, ed., 1:286, n. 1), Elsdon Best. Of course, this retrospective reading was not possible for eighteenth- and nineteenth-century readers of texts. However, the claim of belief in a "Supreme God" stands unaltered. On Buck and Best, see below. Regarding Maori words, when referring to contemporary usage or making my own comments, I follow the current New Zealand convention of using ma- crons and not italicizing. When quoting or referring to older usage I follow the previous practice of omitting macrons and italicizing. ? 1997 by The University of Chicago.

A Pakeha lexicographer and a missionary with a nose for the spurious expressed their view to Best privately that Io was one of a number of contractions of Jehovah and resulted from missionary influence. Further- more, the Maori ethnographer Te Rangi Hiroa and others from a revision- ist school of thought have analyzed Io as a textual artifact from 1949, demonstrating conclusively that Io as Supreme Being was a post-European creation. Despite this, the mythmaking of the early Polynesian Society ethnographers has been extraordinarily pervasive. This article is about mythmaking and the power of texts to create their own realities, and for that mythmaking to be self-perpetuating. Indeed, the intertextuality of Io as Supreme Being has become so dense that it is a veritable Muehlen- beckia australis, that is, a native creeper that becomes so intertwined that it stops any light reaching the tree, eventually rendering it an ecological artifact, but which in the meantime provides birds (read: ethnologists and academics) with a framework in which to make a nest. For instance, in his writing on Polynesian religion in 1927, E. S. Craighill Handy draws freely on the works of Best, Edward Tregear, and C. O. Davis.2 An au- thority no less than Mircea Eliade wrote a number of highly influential texts, which lift Io out of context, separate the "veridical" aspects of ear- lier texts from their intellectual frameworks, treat the Io corpus uncriti- cally, and make unsustainable claims about Io as Supreme Being of the pre-European Maori.3 With the achievement of such canonicity, Io as Su- preme Being could be proudly proclaimed by the more recent text makers of the post-1970s Maori renaissance. James Irwin glosses over a genera- tion of painstaking revisionist scholarship on Io to meet his own emo- tional needs as a "rescuer of Maori tradition" in the present.4 His highly uncritical text perpetuates the mythmaking of earlier generations and 2 See E.

Walk into many a classroom in New Zealand today, and you will find up on the wall Irwin's compelling dia- gram, which neatly stratifies Maori religion, with Io inhabiting the realm of "Ultimate Reality" (fig. 1).5 In an ironic twist, the standard claims on Io have been repeated by the Taiwanese theologian C. S. Song in his at- tempts to create an indigenous theology. It seems he was unaware of the extent to which Io as Supreme Being is the result of extensive intellectual colonization by Western scholars.6 Such intertextuality came full circle when a Pakeha priest cited Song to support his case for an indigenous school represented by ethnologists such as Te Rangi Hiroa, Irwin defers to Best and com- pletes his section on "The Supreme Being" by appealing to an unpublished and unsubstan- tiated claim made by the Reverend P. W. Shirres, who "examined carefully the various early authorities (one source going back to the 1840s) and concluded (personal communi- cation, 1974) that the cult was pre-European in origin" (p. 3). There is no further elucida- tion of this claim. For the latest arguments about Io, see Michael P.

Religious studies scholars seem to be unaware of recent attempts to an- alyze work of Polynesian Society pioneers on Maori religion in terms of the complex interrelationships between texts, interests, institutions, and power. The New Zealand historian M. P. K. Sorrenson is one of the few scholars to explicate the links between these.8 Sorrenson places texts within the context of the changing fashions within the international an- thropological community and analyzes texts and power but without ref- erence to the work of poststructuralists and the new literary criticism.9 An alternative approach has been to interpret the Io corpus within the "invention of tradition literature."1' New Zealand writer Barry Mitcalfe anticipated these views, arguing that the beliefs in Io represent an adjust- ment cult and a response to European onslaught and must not in princi- ple be ruled out as "false or meaningless because they are derivative and without claim to great antiquity."11 More recently in the field of religious 7 See Michael Houghton, "Beware of Insularity," Journeyings 2, no. 3 (June 1989): 8, citing Song, p. 9. Houghton treats the Io cosmology as pre-Christian and argues that it should "find its way into a genuine New Zealand prayer and spirituality book used indi- vidually and in church worship" (p. 8). 8 See M. P. K. Sorrenson, Maori Origins and Migrations: The Genesis of Some Pakeha Myths and Legends (Auckland: Auckland University Press, 1979), and Manifest Duty: The Polynesian Society over 100 Years (Auckland: Polynesian Society, 1992). Sorrenson is overlooked by Irwin and by Jonathan Z. Smith in his reconstruction of Io in his Imagining Religion: From Babylon to Jonestown (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), pp. 66-89. 9 Peter Gibbons also explicates the power relations within the Polynesian Society in his "Johannes Andersen and the Polynesian Society" (University of Waikato, Hamilton, 1986, unpublished MS), p. 48, and in his "'Going Native': A Case Study of Cultural Appropria- tion in a Settler Society, with Particular Reference to the Activities of Johannes Andersen in New Zealand during the First Half of the Twentieth Century" (D.Phil. thesis, University of Waikato, 1992). 10 For early examples, see Eric Hobsbawn and Terence Ranger, eds., The Invention of Tradition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983); and Richard Handler and Joce- lyn Linnekin, "Tradition, Genuine or Spurious," Journal of American Folklore 97, no. 385 (July-September 1984): 273-90. 1 Barry Mitcalfe, "Chants from the Cult of Io," Te Kaunihera Maori (Summer 1969), pp. 9, 11. In the editorial note to the chant, Mitcalfe argues: "Although one can dismiss the Io cult as Buck did, one must not immolate the child simply because its parents were a little deluded. Recitals like the one above do not become false or meaningless because they are derivative and without claim to great antiquity-at least on the Maori side. The beliefs in Io-together with Papahuria (Te Atua Wera), Pai-mairire (Hau-hauism), Ringatu, Tohu- ism, the movements of Rua and of Ratana-represent adjustments cults, attempts to accom- modate Maori and European concepts together in a single unified structure of belief. The difference is that while the others were popular movements, the Io cult was principally an academic revival. Academic and derivative, the Io cult is nonetheless a remarkable crea- tion. It is, of course, not entirely new; there was an Io and he was some sort of God" (p. 9). 53</page><page sequence="5">lo as Supreme Being studies, the American historian of religions Jonathan Z. Smith has tried to demonstrate that the creator Io arose out of the mid-nineteenth-century Hauhau and King movements.12 A New Zealand historian with expertise in classical Maori, Lyndsay Head, rejects Smith's dating and draws on manuscript evidence to conclude that Io arose much later from a world of thought in which pre-Christian Maori religion had become a historical artifact.13 American anthropologist Allan Hanson has analyzed the Io cult specifically within the context of the other American anthropologists of the "invention of tradition" school but laid himself open to charges of reductionism by describing the Io cult and the Great Fleet as "fabrica- tions about indigenous Maori society."14 My main concern in this article is how Io is constructed through text and how a corpus is created. I start with the foundation of the Polynesian Society in 1892 and discuss the significance of this event for the con- tinuing intellectual colonization of the Maori through European texts. Also, it is important to note the textual encapsulations of Io, and Maori religion more generally, to which Best had access before he went into the field among the Tuhoe of the Urewera. It is therefore necessary to conduct a textual survey of earlier nineteenth-century writing on Maori religion. The Io corpus will be examined in terms of shifting meanings, 12 J. Z. Smith, pp. 66-89. Smith's chapter on Io, titled "The Unknown God: Myth in History," starts with a brief discussion of the traditional dichotomy in Western thought between "myth" and "history." He prefers J. H. Plumb's reworking of this in his The Death of the Past (London: Macmillan, 1969) as the distinction between "the past" and "history." More recent work by Hayden White questions whether this distinction is philo- sophically tenable. He argues that all history is a literary artifact. There is no such thing as technical history, unless it is a raw list of names and dates. All history has a theatrical quality: it is either satire, or romance, or comedy, or tragedy (Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974]). 13 Lyndsay Head, "Nineteenth Century Maori Religion on the Ground" (paper presented to the Third Workshop on Primal Spirituality: Indigenous Religious Traditions and Chris- tianity, January 3-7, 1993, East-West Centre, Honolulu, Hawaii). I am indebted to Lyndsay Head for giving me a copy of her paper. The standard claims on Io are also disputed by Jean Rosenfeld in The Island Broken in Two Halves (University Park: Pennsylvania State Uni- versity Press, 1998, in press). For the latest view on the extent of missionary influence, see the entry "Io: A High God" in Margaret Orbell, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Maori Myth and Legend (Christchurch: Canterbury University Press, 1995), pp. 72-75. 14 See Allan Hanson, "The Making of the Maori: Culture Invention and Its Logic," American Anthropologist 91, no. 4 (December 1989): 890-902. When this article was pop- ularized in the New Zealand Herald newspaper in March 1990 it caused a great deal of an- ger and debate. Jonathan Lamb reports on this and takes Hanson's poststructuralist analysis further in his "The New Zealand Sublime," Meanjin 49, no. 4 (Summer 1990): 663-75. Ranganui Walker took issue with Hanson's choice of the word "invent" and argues that there was "nothing inauthentic about the myths and traditions of the Maori collected by Governor Grey, the Rev.

The major part of the article explicates the development of Elsdon Best's writing on Maori religion and sets it against the background of textual devices used in the Journal of the Polynesian Society to "domes- ticate the savage mind," to borrow a phrase from Jack Goody.16 Within the field of thought on Io, the most rigorous attention must be given to Best's thesis that the pre-European Maori evolved their own knowledge of Io as "Supreme Being," denoting a capacity for introspective thought in Maori mentality that "raised" them from European notions of being "savage" to being "barbaric" and well on the road to civilization and monotheism. The materials studied range from books to articles in the Journal of the Polynesian Society, which may itself be considered to be a type of text that contains extremely complicated power relationships. Maori writing on Io in the Journal of the Polynesian Society is discussed within the context of these power relationships. Texts will be placed in the context of the changing fashions within the international anthropo- logical community, but narrow documentary readings of texts on Io will be avoided. Texts are much more than a sign of the times, and for this reason the article has as its main focus the internal relationships within texts on Io, and the intertextuality of published writings on Io. The re- visionists' criticisms of the work of the Polynesian Society pioneers are not treated in their chronological sequence but in conjunction with the works they criticize. Subsequent writing on Io is not surveyed, since it either rests on an un- critical acceptance of the Polynesian Society orthodoxies or passes over both these and the critical work of the revisionists to create new inter- pretations. This survey does not attempt to locate the "true Io," whether in a precolonial or postcolonial context. The main concern is to focus on certain aspects of the colonizing culture rather than on the colonized. These show that the Other was valued not in itself, or even as "object," but in the extent to which it revealed the primitive origins of the religious beliefs of the colonizer, the "subject." 15 On the ways in which a corpus may be read, see Dominick LaCapra, Rethinking In- tellectual History: Texts, Contexts, Language (Ithaca, N.Y., and London: Cornell Univer- sity Press, 1983) and the essays in Jeremy Hawthorn, ed., Criticism and Critical Theory (London: Edward Arnold, 1984). 16 On the use of the table, list, and formula as textual devices, see Jack Goody, The Do- mestication of the Savage Mind (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1970). 55</page><page sequence="7">lo as Supreme Being This article argues that if the Io corpus shows us anything, it speaks of the extent to which the primitive monotheism of a certain school of an- thropologists and of the early historians of religion of this century relied on a textually created myth, which was indispensable for the survival and growth of their new disciplines in competitive and sometimes hos- tile academic environments. These practitioners needed desperately to mark themselves off from the older disciplines of Christian theology as they evolved in the West.17 What better means to do this than through pre-European Supreme Beings, who, on the one hand, showed that the missionary God had not been needed after all and, on the other, that the religious beliefs of "primitive" peoples met post-Enlightenment tests of advanced mentality and introspective thought, making such peoples like us after all? INTELLECTUAL COLONIZATION AND THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Ethnographic material on "the Maori" had been published in books from the time of Captain Cook and from 1868 in the Transactions and Pro- ceedings of the New Zealand Institute. Texts enabled Europeans who came across a nonliterate culture to textualize the people in that culture in what might be termed "intellectual colonization." "The Maori" became embedded in texts through the work of the early missionaries, philolo- gists, ethnologists, and bureaucrats. Their will to textualize was part of an overt will to colonize and "civilize" the "savage" Maori. Textual strate- gies used to domesticate the savage mind included the list, table, index, and cosmology, each in its own way enabling the colonizer to divide, deploy, schematize, and record everything in sight.18 Print set in place a hermeneutical principle quite alien to the thought of the orally steeped to- hungas. A corpus could only be created as Europeans drew ontological and epistemological boundaries between themselves and the Maori, using language that encoded these distinctions, distinguishing their own "civi- lization" from the "savagery" or "barbarism" of "the Maori."19 In time this corpus, which delineated, dominated, and restructured "the Maori," achieved its own mass, density, and authority.

Furthermore, what often purports to be "mere" description of Maori beliefs and practices on closer exami- nation reveals the discursive embodiment of European concepts. As the historian Peter Gibbons has argued, accounts that present themselves as "veridical discourses with competing authenticities are 'grounded' not in the 'real life' of the putative subjects, the other peoples, but in poli- tical, social, intellectual and indeed textual interrelationships between Europeans."20 By the 1890s, the Maori were thought to be heading for extinction and the will to textualize, to dissect and enter on the printed page "the Maori as he was," became insistent.21 The prime mover of the Polynesian So- ciety in 1892, S. Percy Smith, was an amateur ethnologist and diffusion- ist, as were his cofounders Elsdon Best and Edward Tregear.22 Smith was surveyor general of New Zealand; Tregear was soon to become the sec- retary of labour; Best was a more humble civil servant in the Lands and Survey Department. Their interest in "primitive" cultures was "a local variation on an institutional and intellectual practice which recurs through- out the colonising states in the nineteenth century."23 The aims of the so- ciety recognized both the power and importance of texts: "The Society is formed to promote the study of the Anthropology, Ethnology, Phi- lology, History and Antiquities of the Polynesian races, by the publica- tion of an official journal, to be called 'THE JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY;' and by the collection of books, manuscripts, photographs, rel- ics, and other illustrations."24 It has become one of the oldest continu- ously published anthropological journals. Unlike the Transactions, it made Polynesian studies central. Smith saw the prime purpose of the Polyne- sian Society as collecting and publishing Polynesian oral traditions and fixing them in permanent form. This it could now do, unfettered by an institute whose primary concern was with the natural rather than the human sciences.25 By the 1920s the quarterly journal had achieved high status in the international anthropological community. 20 Gibbons, "Johannes Andersen and the Polynesian Society" (n. 9 above), p. 48. 21 The quote is from Elsdon Best, The Maori as He Was: A Brief Account of Maori Life as It Was in Pre-European Days (Wellington: Government Printer, 1924). 22 Diffusionism was important in the romantic period and was reflected in the first eth- nological societies founded in Europe in the 1840s. By about 1890 a reaction against the logical inconsistencies of the evolutionist theory stimulated a revival of interest in dif- fusionism, which analyzed the spread of culture from one ethnic group or area to another, frequently positing a common originatory point to explain perceived cultural similarities. 23 Gibbons, "Johannes Anderson and the Polynesian Society," p. 10. 24 Journal of the Polynesian Society (hereafter cited as JPS) 1, no. 1 (April 1892): 3. 25 Sorrenson, Manifest Duty (n. 8 above), pp. 18, 24, 33. 57</page><page sequence="9">lo as Supreme Being To colonize meant the identification, if not the creation, of interests. Faced with a "dying race," these ethnographers found it their "manifest duty" to rescue some portion of the lost, past, neolithic "Maori as he was" in order to facilitate ameliorations in the present. They employed their vision of this past to best advantage.26 Texts allowed them imagi- nary compensation for the defects of empirial reality.27 A cursory reading of obituaries to Elsdon Best published in the Journal in 1931 makes such imaginary compensation clear.28 The work of the amateur ethnographers of the fledgling Polynesian Society helped to reinforce the notion that "the Maori" were in romantic decline, evidenced by the proliferation of romantic images that started, at the end of the nineteenth century, to compete with images of the ignoble savage.29 However, the old colonial hands who had formed the Polynesian So- ciety themselves represented a dying order, stranded by the turn of the century. Their competence in written Maori showed that they belonged to the colonial Maori past. From the 1840s, through the influence of mission schools, Maori wrote extensively and were great readers of Maori news- papers. Throughout this century, the language of communication between Maori and Pakeha was Maori. However, by 1913 the language of mana had become English. The last Maori newspaper was published in the 1930s, by which time Maori emphasized the orality of their culture, hav- ing lost the literacy.30 The romanticization of "the Maori" occurs then among the old colonial hands, whose world was dying. Smith and Best, both having been part of the Armed Constabulary dispatched to counter Maori passive resistance at Parihaka in the 1870s, now joined the scram- ble to textualize oral traditions before they were lost forever.31 TEXTUAL ENCAPSULATIONS OF IO AND MAORI RELIGION, 1855-91 Even before Best emerged from the Ureweras for the last time as pay- master-storeman of a roading party, clutching his voluminous notebooks on the Tuhoe, he was familiar with the claims of earlier writers that the pre-European Maori believed in a Supreme Being. It is therefore neces- 26 On this process in relation to orientalism, see Said (n. 18 above), p. 79. 27 On this "escapist function" of texts, and the contestatory function of questioning the empirical, see LaCapra (n. 15 above), p. 45. 28 JSP 41, no. 1 (1932): 1-39. 29 On the analysis of colonial images of the "native," see Leonard Bell, Colonial Con- structs: European Images of Maori, 1840-1914 (Auckland: Auckland University Press, 1992); cf. images of the Australian Aborigines in Alan Atkinson and Marian Aveling, eds., Australians, 1838 (Broadway, N.S.W.: Fairfax, Syme &amp; Weldon, 1987), pp. 64-67. 30 For these comments, I am indebted to Lyndsay Head of the Maori Department, the University of Canterbury. 31 According to joint JPS editor, Johannes Andersen, Best "saw no fighting" at Parihaka, JPS 41, no. 1 (1932): 33.

As in the later debates, a variety of intellectual frame- works shapes the raw data. It was not a missionary but a medical doctor who was the first to claim that Maori religious concepts that have an alleged resemblance to Judeo- Christian concepts reveal the influence of missionary education, rather than the presence of pre-European religious concepts. In his second edi- tion of Traditions and Superstitions of the New Zealanders, Edward Short- land applied the tools of textual criticism to Governor Sir George Grey's claims in his Polynesian Mythology (1855).32 Shortland argued that while a paragraph on the origin of the use of charms and incantations clearly rested on veritable traditionary authority, the claim immediately follow- ing that "it was the great God that taught these prayers to man" was sus- pect.33 Shortland notes that this remark "would naturally lead the reader to infer that the New Zealander had an idea of God in the sense of a supreme intelligence. The fact, however, is not so; for neither in any existing superstition nor tradition, purely such, is there to be found in- ternal evidence that an idea of God existed more exalted than that of the spirit of a dead ancestor."34 The qualifying paragraph was a gloss by "the person who wrote the manuscript for Sir George Grey, and the nat- ural remark of a native instructed in Christianity."35 Among the missionary ethnologists, the most able and sympathetic, the Reverend Richard Taylor, advanced the synthetic concept of the Semitic Maori. Like Thomas Kendall, he viewed them as one of the lost tribes of Israel.36 In Te Ika a Maui, published in 1855, Taylor defended the intel- ligence of the Maori but also claimed that "the New Zealand race" had 32 Edward Shortland, Traditions and Superstitions of the New Zealanders, With Illustra- tion of their Manners and Customs, 2d ed.

They had a multitude of gods ... so mixed up with the spirits of ancestors, whose worship is entered largely into their religion, that it is difficult to distinguish one from the other."38 Other missionaries expressed similar ideas, although more negatively. William Colenso claimed that the Maori "had neither doctrine nor dogma, neither cultus nor system of worship. They knew not of any Being who could properly be called God."39 The Reverend James Buller dismissed Maori religion in one sentence: "The Maoris were devil-worshippers."40 In contrast to Taylor's degeneration theory, Arthur Thomson, a medi- cal scientist, advanced evolutionary theory. His Story of New Zealand: Past and Present-Savage and Civilized, published in 1859, claimed that Maori religion belonged to "the infancy of a race. It was a religion dictated by wants and fears."41 In the long term, "the Maori" would dis- appear as a distinct entity. It is not until 1876 that there occurred the first textual conjunction of the words "Supreme Being" and "Io." Charles Davis, former chief trans- lator to the government, reinforced his claims about Maori religion by appeal to sacredness, secrecy, and antiquity.42 His working assumption was that "the old Maori possessed considerable true religious knowledge shrouded in the drapery of tradition and legend."43 Davis claimed that 37 Richard Taylor, Te Ika a Maui, or New Zealand and Its Inhabitants (London: Wer- theim &amp; Macintosh, 1855), p. 8. 38 Ibid., p. 13. 39 William Colenso, "On the Maori Races of New Zealand," Transactions and Proceed- ings of the New Zealand Institute 1 (1868): 385.

The name was Io, perhaps an abbre- viation of Iouru .... Witnessing my anxiety to obtain further information on the subject, he refused to disclose any more Maori secrets as he called them, and politely referred me to an old Priest who resided about one hundred miles off.45 The sacredness and secrecy that are thus made to surround Io were also insisted on in Davis's introductory remarks in the appendix, which contained his main supportive evidence, a karakia, claimed to be "an- cient" and "olden."46 This text has been critically examined by the revi- sionist scholars of the 1940s and 1950s, who showed that Davis misread the text, provided his own gloss, and showed a certain eagerness to find evidence for the existence of Io. Te Rangi Hiroa dismissed the text as "pseudo-evidence," while J. Prytz Johansen argued that the priest's re- fusal to give further information "may as well be due to ignorance as to Io's sacral nature."47 Whether evidence or pseudoevidence, this account had no impact on the progressive development theories of the international anthropologi- cal community. The thesis of Edward Tylor's highly influential 1871 two- volume work, Primitive Culture, was that animism was religion in its most primitive, minimal form, from which all "higher" and monotheistic religions had evolved. The English anthropologist argued that humanity had since developed along "progressive and uniformitarian" lines rather than the "degenerational, providential" lines of Christian theology.48 Prim- itive Culture was widely translated and continuously reprinted up to 1920. The discovery that upset this theory was made not in New Zealand but 44 Ibid., p. 13. 45 Ibid., pp. 13, 14. 46 Ibid., pp. 132, 133. 47 Te Rangi Hiroa, The Coming of the Maori (Wellington: Maori Purposes Fund Board and Whitcombe &amp; Tombs, 1949), p. 532; J.

From 1882 to 1887 the Journal of the Royal Anthropo- logical Institute, a highly reputable international journal, reported A. W. Howitt's dramatic discovery of the figure of "All Father" among the Aus- tralian Aborigines.49 Andrew Lang, a Scot who had come to the study of religion through Tylor, drew on Howitt's material to postulate a new the- ory, that belief in primitive "High Gods" had predated animism. Lang's text, The Making of Religion (1889), argued for a primitive monotheism in chapters titled "The High Gods of Low Races" and "More Savage Su- preme Beings." In his variant of the degeneracy theory, Lang concluded that the original primitive conception had been subverted by a poly- theistic animism derived from death and dream experiences.50 However, Tylor argued back, this time claiming that either direct or indirect mis- sionary influence accounted for such beliefs.51 New material on Io was not to be published for eleven years. Davis knew that the interpreter to the Native Land Office, John White, had ac- cumulated a large quantity of Maori lore, "furnished by native priests, from whom alone indeed such information could be procured with any- thing like accuracy." Acutely aware of the referential power of texts, he had stated his hope in 1876 that White would share his findings with the public.52 This he did, but by giving a plurality of meanings for Io in The Ancient History of the Maori: His Mythology and Traditions, seven vol- umes published by the Government Printer from 1887 to 1890. In the first three volumes, Io was variously placed at the head of a Ngai Tahu genealogical cosmogony, invoked in a song, but with White's editorial comment that "Io is really the god. He made the heaven and the earth," and was identified as involuntary twitching of any part of the human body, an omen of good or evil (Ngati Ruanui).53 The third volume has 49 For further details, see J.

Tony Swain locates the intrusion of the All Father within the con- text of a colonial onslaught (A Place for Strangers: Towards a History of Australian Ab- original Being [Cambridge and Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 1993], pp. 114-58). 51 E. B. Tylor, "The Limits of Savage Religion," Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 21 (1891): 283-301, argued forcefully that such "High Gods" were created in either direct or indirect response to the missionary activities and teaching of European Christians. 52 Davis (n. 43 above), pp. 129, 130. 53 The Ngai Tahu Cosmogony starts: "Io (power, god) begat Io-nuku (god of the world), who begat Io-rangi (god of the heavens), who begat Tahito-te-raki (ancient of the heavens)" (John White, The Ancient History of the Maori: His Mythology and Traditions, 7 vols.

The same Tahitian evidence cited by Abraham Fornander to support his Semitic diffusion theory was cited by Tregear in support of Io as a pan-Pacific deity.56 In his definition of Io, Tregear cited Grey, Davis, and White's questionable material. He claimed a derived authority from the German Sanskritist F. Max Miiller to whom the work was dedicated.57 Tregear provided seven meanings, including "God, The Supreme Being," "power," "the soul," "a twitching," "fish cut into strips, and dried in a native oven," and the progenitor in a Moriori genealogy.58 In an appendix Tregear included a genealogy from the Ngati- Maniapoto. The Progenitor is named as "Te-Ahau-o-te-Rangi (or Io)," heading the male side.59 THE DEVELOPMENT OF BEST'S WRITING ON MAORI RELIGION AND THE INTERTEXTUALITY OF IO Given this background, it is now possible to explicate the development of Best's writing on Maori religion. The textual intimacy possible among members of the Polynesian Society is crucial to this new stage of the domestication of the savage mind. Best's first articles were highly eclectic, showing the amateur basis of his ethnography. These were published in the first volume of the Journal 76. White's quoted comment can be found at 2:1, 2.

In two short pieces he discussed "The Races of the Philippines" and "Prehistoric Civ- ilization in the Philippines."60 In 1898, three years after he started work as paymaster-storeman of a roading party in the Ureweras, the JPS pub- lished his article titled "Omens and Superstitious Beliefs of the Maori."61 Although Christianity had first been recorded among the Tuhoe in 1842, Best's working assumption throughout the whole of his sixteen years with them was that their tribal lands in the land-locked Urewera meant that he could find among them a "pre-contact mind."62 This article con- tained the results of his early attempts to probe behind the veil into the realm of Maori religious beliefs. "Elsdon Best, of Tuhoe-land, N.Z.," de- scribed omens, omens derived from dreams, omens in regard to weaving, aitua in carving, divination, and the eight talents.63 He neatly displaced a painful century of colonization and the decades of missionary influence in his statement that "it must not be supposed that the so-called Christian Maori has cast off the shackles of superstition-by no means. He is no more capable of doing so in two or three generations than we ourselves are. He is still a strong believer in omens, signs, witchcraft and many other doleful matters."64 Best wasted no time in presenting these views to the international anthropological community in articles in the Ameri- can Antiquarian and in the Australasian Association for the Advance- ment of Science Report.65 Best's biographer, Elsdon Craig, claims that his subject's informants among the Tuhoe, Tutakangahua, and Ngahoro "applied appropriate pro- hibitions" when Best made mere mention of a "first cause in the uni- verse."66 Craig claims that Best "put forward what little he had learnt 60 Elsdon Best, "The Races of the Philippines," JPS 1 (1892): 7-19, and "Pre-historic Civilisation in the Philippines," JPS 1 (1892): 118-25. 61 Elsdon Best, "Omens and Superstitious Beliefs of the Maori," pts. 1 and 2, JPS 8, no. 28 (December 1898): 119-36, 233-43. 62 An Anglican mission was established at Te Ngae, Rotorua, in 1835 and Tuhoe had soon obtained at least one Bible. In 1842, two or three years after Tuhoe first discussed the possibility of accepting Christianity, a number of the tribe were baptized by the Anglican missionary J. A. Wilson. Other missionaries, including a Roman Catholic priest, also vis- ited.

A thor- ough search of this series of articles on Maori religion, published in 1902 and 1903 rather than in 1899 as claimed in the Best bibliography in the JPS and in Craig, has shown there is no mention of Io, let alone of prim- itive monotheism.67 It is clear then that Craig's reading is a retrospective one, made in the light of Best's later work. We can therefore dismiss Craig's claims that it is at this stage that Best argues that in "ancient times the Maori had possessed a monotheistic religion which more recently had been forced into 'innocuous dissuetude' by animism and ancestor wor- ship" and that "these less elevated concepts had been evolved in response to democratic demand for a more liberal religion for the masses." Simi- larly suspect is Craig's claim that this left "the Io cult to become the closely guarded property of a few select families. For this reason alone the missionaries had rarely encountered it and when they had, experi- enced little difficulty in suppressing it."68 The first article on lo as "Supreme Being" in the JPS was written by a Methodist missionary and corresponding member of the Polynesian So- ciety. The Reverend T. G. Hammond provided no new textual evidence but drew liberally on John White and repeated the secrecy motif first elucidated by Davis in 1876. His text is laced with phrases such as "the mysteries of his race," "guard that knowledge most sacredly," "under most exclusive circumstances," and "such sacred knowledge."69 The ed- itor Percy Smith saw fit to add his own comments to reinforce the veil of secrecy surrounding Io.70 The following year Best, in contrast, was highly critical of claims by Cook and Davis that the pre-European Maori worshipped and, moreover, worshipped a "Supreme Being." In the first of two JPS articles on "spiri- tual concepts of the Maori" in 1900, Best states flatly that "the Maori really worshipped nothing."71 These two substantial articles set out Best's presuppositions on Maori mentality. The arguments he would later use to support the case for a "neolithic lo" rested on the same premises.

The new theory had critiqued those "modern philosophers who have approached the study of savage life with preconceived ideas as to the religions of savages and with a determination to find just what falls in with their theories."73 While Best was all too well aware of "the great danger to anyone who attempts to collect at first hand the religious ideas of a savage or barba- rous people," he nevertheless argued that by taking down "directly from the lips of native speakers, such speakers moreover being the elderly men of the Tuhoe tribe, the most conservative of Maoris who have ever held themselves aloof from the intruding pakeha (European)" he could "dis- prove" the widely held assertion "stated by presumably intelligent people that the Maori has, and had, no knowledge or power of abstract thought."74 In a curious borrowing from both Tylor and Lang, Best maintained that "the Maori were not agnostics, inasmuch as they had a firm belief in their atua (deified ancestors, &amp;c., &amp;c.), and also in their cosmogony. They had not risen to monotheism but were polytheists of a most pronounced na- ture. Their so-called gods were as the sands of the seashore in number."75 Best wished to prove that the pre-European Maori had the power of ab- stract thought, but he remained skeptical "that the ancestors of the race ever practised monotheism."76 While Best argued that "the Maori of old was metaphysical and sought the cause of things and their relation to himself," he was not convinced by the allegedly "older traditions," which asserted that "at a very remote period, there was but one god, who was all-powerful and created other gods."77 Rather, the Maori had "evolved the belief in a singular and anagogic essence or ichor which ... pervades and vivifies all nature, man, land and matter," a belief that would remain forever alien from the European, who had entered a "different plane of 72 The quotes are from ibid., p. 173.

Older than racial characteristics, as old as the human race ... ancient beyond compare," features that he had presumably come to under- stand through his reading of the international anthropological literature. Best's skepticism was not shared by Polynesian Society cofounder Edward Tregear.79 In a highly synthetic account, based entirely on sec- ondary sources, mainly Davis and White, Tregear claimed that Maori cosmology pointed to "a central point of deity, whether that be called Io (a name of awe in many ancient religions) or another."80 Tregear dedi- cated his book The Maori Race (1904) to Elsdon Best, and the preface was by Percy Smith, suggesting a certain textual intimacy. The chapter on Maori religion subjected the reader to a full battery of Io references from Davis, White, and Fornander.81 Tregear's attempt to "stratify" Maori religion reflects Eurocentric notions and has a strange sacramental twist: First we must disassociate in the Maori religion, as in all other religions, the "outward and visible sign" from the "inward spiritual grace." There was an outward religion which found its exponent in the charms and spells of priests, in observing the forms of tapu, in reverence and devotion to sacred objects and to the lesser gods of the tribe or locality. Inside all this, however, was an inner circle wherein those who understood the esoteric teaching lived in a larger world with abstract deities to worship, or probably with one god only as the centre and source of all their religious energies. Into that inner circle it is almost im- possible to pierce, but now and then we shall get glimpses therein which will more than repay the toil of investigation.82 From 1905 the Polynesian Society reaped a rich textual harvest from the field of speculation on Io as "Supreme Being." Starting with two JPS articles by Best's brother-in-law, Lieutenant-Colonel W. E. Gudgeon, a "textual mesh" tightened the "net" around Io in a kind of mutual re- inforcement.83 Gudgeon was resident commissioner to the Cook Islands from 1899 to 1909, but he had access during this time to a document given him some years before by "Tiwai Paraone, of the Maru-tuahu tribes of 78 Best, "Sketches from Tuhoeland: Religious Rites of the Maori: Sacred Fires," p. 53. 79 The quotes are from ibid., and Elsdon Best, "Sketches from Tuhoeland: Religious Rites of the Ancient Maori.

Drawing on Davis's notion of Io as the preserve of a priestly elite,85 he classified Maori reli- gion into two systems, using the categories "purely abstract" and "infe- rior." The second article tells us very little about a pre-European Io, but it speaks volumes about the books Gudgeon had on his library shelves when commissioner in Rarotonga. It shows the unmistakable legacy of A. W. Howitt and Andrew Lang: Among the Maoris there are traces of two religious systems, one of which is purely abstract in its conception of the Deity, and of a very exalted type, inas- much as it attributes the existence of all things to the great god 'Io.' The second is probably a later and most certainly an inferior conception, in which the pow- ers of nature are personified in the persons of certain anthropomorphic gods, and it is this fact that constitutes the difference between the two systems. Io, the su- preme creator, occupies a position in the Maori Pantheon, apart from and supe- rior to that of any other Maori deity; he is the great originator, the All-Father, who pervades space, has no residence, and cannot be localised. Here then we have a clear and reasonable conception of a supreme spiritual essence, or con- trolling power; of a deity who is practically unknown to the modern Maori.86 While Gudgeon attacked the early missionaries for their narrow-minded- ness, claiming that Taylor's "lost tribes" theory biased his presentation, his assertion of a pre-European age of Maori religious practice, which had receded following the introduction of a missionary theology of "fire and brimstone," nevertheless showed his own distinctive theorizing.87 Employing a diffusionist ethnographic framework, Gudgeon noted that "among the ancient Egyptians Io was the Lunar Goddess," showing a point of resemblance between "Maori tradition and the records of India or Egypt."88 Although the Samoans ascribed "to Tangaroa those divine powers which the Maoris claim for Io," subsequent Melanesian influence 84 [J. P Smith], "A Maori Cosmogony," JPS 16, no. 63 (September 1907): 109-12, translated by Hare Hongi, JPS 16, no. 63 (September 1907): 113-19. 85 See above, pp. 60-61. This "borrowing" is clear, despite Gudgeon's criticism of Davis, that his informants had refused to yield to him the inner "secrets" of the Io cult because they recognized in him "the extreme of Christian fanaticism," saw him as "the exponent of a lachrymose species of religion of the miserable sinner type," and therefore left the Euro- pean knowing "next to nothing" of Maori religion (Gudgeon, "Mana Tangata," p. 51). 86 Gudgeon, "Maori Religion," p. 108. 87 Ibid., p. 107. 88 Ibid., p. 109. For Edward Tregear's theories on the Indian origins of the Maori, see his Aryan Maori (Wellington: G. Didsbury, Government Printer, 1885). The comparative philologist J. Macmillan Brown claimed a "tendency to monotheism" in the esoteric phase of Polynesian religion, basing this on John White's text. These seemed to suggest the dif- fusion of Maori religious concepts from "the south of Asia, and by preference from North- ern India," in particular "the later Vedic or earlier Hindoo religion, when Buddhism was about to be begotten, and the idea of a supreme and only God struggled with half-scientific, 68</page><page sequence="20">History of Religions meant that Samoan religious notions were less ancient than Maori be- liefs.89 Gudgeon's deism is apparent in the chief lesson he draws from Maori mythology "that after Io had by mere force of his will started the powers of nature into action the world developed itself by evolution, light springing out of darkness."90 Gudgeon attacked the early missionaries for their narrow-mindedness and castigated them for leaving "no literary record by which succeeding generations might remember" the Maori. In contrast, Sir George Grey, John White, and Judge Manning were shining lights in the textual dark- ness. Gudgeon finally portrayed Percy Smith and Elsdon Best as the de- liverers of the European understanding of "the Maori" from a textual wilderness into the promised land of documentary sufficiency.91 Sorren- son, who wrote the centennial history of the Polynesian Society, has con- cluded that Gudgeon's work was "unstructured and uncritical-like much of the other material on Maori oral tradition that Smith printed, just to get it into print, irrespective of its intrinsic merit."92 The document from Tiwai Paraone, on which Gudgeon's views were based, was published in the JPS in 1907 and distributed as a separate offprint. The original is no longer extant.93 The substantial editorial in- troduction to the Maori text is the first case of intertextuality within the Journal itself on matters relating to Io.94 In the sixteen sections of Maori text Io occurs six times. In the translation by Hare Hongi there are four additional interpolated references to Io. lo is alleged to have "dwelt within the breathing-space of immensity," commanded the waters to separate, "fashioned the Universe," "caused light to shine in the darkness," and "caused other reproductions of himself."95 Hare Hongi, whose British half-crude ideas that philosophised the origin of the universe and man, when, in short, monotheism struggled with a philosophic pantheism." MacMillan Brown's conclusion that "this is undiluted Hindoo philosophy of the halfdozen centuries before our era" fitted in with the half-millennium postulated by earlier ethnologists as the probable time of the arrival of the Maori in New Zealand (Maori and Polynesian, Their Origin, History and Culture [London: Hutchinson &amp; Co., 1907], p. 131). 89 Gudgeon, "Maori Religion," p. 109. 90 Ibid., p. 110. On the last piece of "evidence" for lo presented in 1905, a genealogy with Io at its head, see JPS, vol. 16, no. 56 (December 1905). The editorial note claimed that this genealogy recited by the late principal chief of Ngati-Maniapoto, Wahanui, "il- lustrates in a very complete manner Mr. Best's remarks on the successive generative ideas applied to chaos, and which moreover shows at the head, or origin of it, the seldom men- tioned and exceedingly sacred god Io, as the origin of all things." The editors acknowledged the discrepancy between this postulated origin and that asserted by Best but dismissed this as being so because "it comes from a different tribe." 91 Gudgeon, "Mana Tangata," p. 51. 92 Sorrenson, Manifest Duty (n. 8 above), p. 39. 93 Johansen was later to describe it as "a mystery jealously guarded" by the JPS editors (Johansen [n. 47 above], p. 50). 94 [Smith] (n. 84 above), p. 109. 95 Hongi, trans.

He claimed that its original setting was "antique" but that in the extant "fragment of mosaic, some of the missing parts of which have been substituted by slightly later material," there was a "con- fusion of the original pattern." Nevertheless, the fragment was unique in its introduction of uncommon ideas, presumably about the creator Io.96 Te Rangi Hiroa, who had a good nose for textual embellishments, later showed that the acts performed by Io could have been borrowed from Genesis and that other material recycles the popular version of Rangi and Papa and other Io material from Ngati Kahungunu.97 Lyndsay Head, as a scholar of classical Maori, notes that the Gudgeon document is highly syncretistic and a poor fake. It lacks the ring of ancient authenticity, the staccato character, arbitrariness, and sudden changes of key of ancient Maori.98 Nevertheless she criticizes Jonathan Z. Smith's exclusive use of this text to support his case that the creator Io arose out of the mid- nineteenth-century Hauhau and King movements. Instead she uses a va- riety of Maori sources to postulate a much later context for Io. It is only after the publication of the Gudgeon manuscript that Best claims that he found Io among the Tuhoe.99 He had earlier categorized "the Maori" as barbaric rather than savage. In an article published in the Proceedings of the Australasian Associationfor the Advancement of Sci- ence, Best now designated "the Maori" as "neolithic," in one of the first occurrences of this term in a text on Maori religion.'00 This had the subliminal effect of pushing the practices described back in time beyond the period of possible European contamination or Maori religious syn- cretism. Best claimed a noble authority in the person of John Lubbock, who popularized the terms "palaeolithic" and "neolithic" in 1865 with his book Pre-historic Times. l0 Furthermore, Best added an "upper com- 96 Ibid., p. 118. 97 Hiroa (n. 47 above), pp. 533, 534. 98 I am indebted to Lyndsay Head for these comments. 99 Tregear claimed in 1904 that to "utter 'the ineffable name' (Io) under a roof of any kind was to blaspheme most frightfully, and would be a sacrilege that only an ignorant person (religiously ignorant) like a European would have the depravity to attempt.... A European student of Maori lore once ventured to speak to an old priest whom he met in a country store (shop) and asked him some question about ancient history. The Maori turned round with a disgusted look and remarked, 'This is no place in which to speak of solemn things."' Whether or not this passage refers to Best among the Tuhoe, it does not prove that the Tuhoe had a pre-European Supreme Being called Io.

If the tribal gods fell into the "inferior" category, Io must by implication be the "superior" being. He described the Maori gods as "mostly malevolent beings" with the exception of "the mighty Io." He then claimed: "I was told by the last of the wise men of the Tuhoe tribe that Io was the first of all gods, and the principal one. The old man said-'The cult of Io was very an- cient. He was a god of very ancient times. It was he who was the origin of all gods. He was the beginning (or first) of the gods.'"102 Best's second informant, also unnamed but a member of the Ngai Tahu tribe, once told him "that Io was born of Rangi and Papa, the Heavens and Earth." Instead of postulating secrecy as the reason for lack of Eu- ropean knowledge of Io, Best claimed that the laws of tapu kept Maori people silent on their religious mysteries. Best thus substitutes very neatly a Maori notion for a European one: "The cult of Io was so excessively tapu, that any divulging of such matter would mean the death of the divulger, and also, probably, the affliction of his people by some dire calamity." He then cited a battery of international authorities to reinforce the alleged antiquity of the Io cult. Sir G. W. Cox had spoken of "the Io of classical mythology as a lunar myth," and T. G. Pinches regarded Io as reflecting a tendency to monotheism also present among the Babylo- nians.103 It is at this stage, after the publication of the Gudgeon manu- script, and not in 1902 in the Canterbury Times articles, that Best applies Andrew Lang's categories in The Making of Religion to the Io materi- als.104 With the intellectual scaffolding of arguments for an ancient Io cult now complete, Best was left with the question he had often asked "old natives": "I have often asked old natives the reason why their fathers gave up the practice of their ancient religion and accepted Christianity. Their answers were prompt and plain. A deity whose subjects could ac- quire written language, make guns and numberless other wondrous things, must be one worth cultivating; the ignorant Maori people might gain much from him."105 In December 1909 Percy Smith told Best that he had just received Maori documents from H. T. Whatahoro, or J. A. Jury, a corresponding member of the Polynesian Society since 1907. Smith had been in com- munication with him for some years. In 1908 T. W. Downes was busy copying the manuscript out. Smith was told that the manuscript had been dictated to Whatahoro in 1863 by an old tohunga of the Wairarapa, Moihi Te Matorohanga. Subsequent textual analysis by Bruce Biggs and David Simmons has shown that the manuscript was a composite, including 102 Best, "Maori Religion," pp. 458, 460. 103 Ibid., p. 461. 104 For earlier discussion on this, see above, p. 66. 105 Best, "Maori Religion," p. 464. 71</page><page sequence="23">Io as Supreme Being pages of English text recorded by Whatahoro's Pakeha father, J. M. Jury, around 1840, traditions recorded by Whatahoro from recitations of oral traditions in a specially constructed whare wananga by Te Matorohanga, Nepia Pohuhu and other tohunga, and additional material copied more recently by Whatahoro from other sources.106 After copying Whatahoro's manuscripts and translating them into English, Percy Smith published them serially in the JPS in 1912-13 and separately in society memoirs as The Lore of the Whare-wananga. Part 1, "Things Celestial," was pub- lished in 1913, followed by part 2, "Things Terrestrial," in 1915. In his preface to the Lore Percy Smith referred to a highly selective group of nineteenth-century authorities, choosing not to survey in detail the Io territory as portrayed by White. He merely said, "Mr. John White, also one of the Government Interpreters, was acquainted with the fact of the Maoris having a supreme god Io, but he has left little record about him."107 This amnesia meant the Io corpus was denied its contradictory nature and was therefore now able to be artificially unified. While Jona- than Z. Smith has shown the important role that the Lore has played in the development of the history of religions, attaining "all but canonical status," Sorrenson concluded in 1992 that "as a text on traditional Maori religion, Part I on 'Things Celestial' was about as reliable as the New Tes- tament on the sayings of Jesus."108 Smith had told Best in 1910 that the manuscripts contained in its "pure" form the Io religion, recorded at what was said to have been the last school of esoteric teaching held in the Wairarapa in the 1860s.109 The manuscripts used by Percy Smith in 1911 contained many titles of Io that are translated in the Polynesian Society text as: "Io-the-great," "Io-the-parentless"; "Io-the-omnierudite," "the origin of all things," "Io- the-unseen-face"; "Io-the father " showing the relation of Io to Rangi and Papa; and finally, sixteen titles exegeted in three pages. This last sec- tion is called "Io-matua, the Supreme God."110 This 193-page text was one of the first to include an index in which Io figured. 106 David Simmons and Bruce Biggs, "The Sources of 'The Lore of the Whare- wananga"' JPS 79, no. 1 (March 1970): 22-42.

Among Smith's Pakeha coworkers, the Right Reverend Herbert Williams, the veteran lexicographer, and the Reverend T. G. Hammond expressed their criticisms of the Lore to Smith and Best, but in private correspondence rather than in the pages of the JPS.l12 Neither believed in Io, although to Smith the evidence was "overwhelmingly in its favour."113 Given the private nature of these criticisms, there was to be no equivalent to the Lang/Tylor debate in the pages of the JPS. By 1910, Best's ethnographic data gather in the Urewera had earned him a temporary position as ethnologist at the Dominion Museum in Wellington. A year after the first Whatahoro manuscripts were published in the JPS, Best launched himself into the international anthropological community with an article in the prestigious journal of the Royal An- thropological Institute, Man, titled "The Cult of Io, the Concept of a Supreme Deity as Evolved by the Ancestors of the Polynesians."114 This is one of the first instances in which Best prefaced his material with the thoughts of an international authority. Later these would be presented page after page in a piling up of authorities. 11l Sorrenson, Manifest Duty, p. 37. 112 Sorrenson, Maori Origins and Migrations (n. 8 above), p. 52, notes that Williams wrote privately to Best and kept his criticisms of their claims about Io private. His article, "The Maruiwi Myth," was published in the JPS 46 (1937): 105-22, long after the deaths of Smith and Best. In this Williams argues that "the adoption of Christianity had inevitably a serious effect upon the branch of learning which dealt with things celestial" but does not cite Io (p. 106). The Reverend T. G. Hammond, an expert in the lore of the descendants of the Aotea canoe, wrote to Best privately to express his disappointment with pt. 1 of the Lore (Sorrenson, Maori Origins and Migrations, p. 52, citing Smith to Best, September 22, 1916 and Smith to Best, November 21, 1917); Hammond to Best, August 1, 1915 (MS Papers 72, folder 5, Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, N.Z.). According to Gibbons, "Johannes Andersen and the Polynesian Society" (n. 9 above), the orthodoxies established by Percy Smith and Elsdon Best in the first two decades of this century could not be chal- lenged through the JPS while their protege, Andersen, remained editor. This limited the development both of critiques and of new theories about the Maori. H. D. Skinner's criti- cism of the Lore was published in his The Morioris of Chatham Islands (Honolulu: Ber- nice P. Bishop Museum, 1923). It did not attack the Io interpolations. For Simmons and Biggs's criticisms, see above, pp. 71-72. They restated the dangers of accepting oral tradi- tion uncritically. They were able to separate many of the accretions and interpolations of Whatahoro and Smith from those traditions originally given. 113 Sorrenson, Manifest Duty, p. 38, citing Smith to Best, November 21, 1917 (MS Pa- pers 72, folder 5, Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, N.Z.). In this Smith complained to Best that Williams had discarded many of the words he had sent him for consideration for publication in the fifth edition of his dictionary. See Herbert W. Williams, Dictionary of the Maori Language (Wellington: Marcus F Marks, Government Printer, 1917), pp. 92, 93, s.v. "Io." Eight meanings are given, but none is religious. 114 Elsdon Best, "The Cult of Io, the Concept of a Supreme Deity as Evolved by the Ancestors of the Polynesians," Man 57 (1913): 98-103. 73</page><page sequence="25">lo as Supreme Being Andrew Lang's theory of the "high gods of low races" and of "savage supreme beings" called for evidence. Best claimed he had such evidence, when he presented Io as the prime exhibit in his case for advanced Maori mentality. He drew freely and without acknowledgment on the Io ma- terials in the Lore. The use of the word "evolved" in the title prepared readers for Best's view of the high antiquity of the deity. He freely em- ployed Lubbock's category of "neolithic" throughout the article, thereby making the cult of Io neolithic by the power of association. Best's will to textualize was as clear as his paternalistic attitude: It is now many years since we first gained a dim knowledge that the Maori be- lieved in the existence of a Supreme Being, and throughout those long years have we diligently sought "more light" on the subject. Some information gained from an old tattooed survivor of the neolithic era some ten years ago put us on the right track, and since that time we have obtained much more light from a remarkably intelligent and intellectual native. The information so gained we now offer in the following pages, as evidence that an "inferior race," a "savage" people, was quite capable of evolving the concept of a Supreme Being, a crea- tive and eternal god, a Deity that did not punish the soul of men after the death of the body. A perusal of these notes will show any unbiassed readers (not a numerous body, we opine) that the Supreme Being of the Maori occupied a much higher plane than that of certain old-time Semites.115 Best employed the standard textual device of the list to present names of Io published in the Lore. He also stratified Maori religion, claiming that "the pure cult of Io was of too elevated a character for the common people," echoing claims first made by Davis in 1876.116 In this article Io became the prime exhibit in Best's case for advanced Maori mentality, which he had first advanced in the JPS in 1900. Best was satisfied that he had now been able to show that "the ancestors of the Maori, in times long passed away evolved a highly curious cult upon a very high plane of thought, one strongly tinged with monotheistic ideas, and replete with extremely fine conceptions of the attributes of a supreme Deity."117 This article drew a response from the internationally renowned anthro- pologist, D. G. Lillie. He told Best that it was valuable and was very much needed. He assured Best that the Royal Anthropological Institute would now publish "without question" everything Best might discover on the cult of Io.118 Best and Smith basked in the afterglow of international rec- ognition, particularly following a review by the British anthropologist 115 Ibid., pp. 98, 99. 116 Ibid., pp. 100, 103. On Davis, see above, pp. 60-61. 117 Best, "The Cult of Io," p. 103. 118 Craig (n. 66 above), pp. 168, 169. 74</page><page sequence="26">History of Religions A. C. Haddon in the London Morning Post.119 Haddon recognized that the Io teaching had become the framework, if not the organizational principle, in Best's and Smith's work on "the Maori": "Centre and core of the whole religious teaching is the doctrine of Io, 'the supreme god, cre- ator of all things, dwelling in the twelfth, or upper most, Heaven, where no minor god might enter except by command."' While noting that the two scribes of the documents published in the Lore had been educated in mission schools, Haddon nevertheless asserted that "there is abun- dant evidence that this high god is no modern introduction; the kar- akias (prayers) to him contain many obsolete terms."120 Like Williams and Hammond, he aired the view "that Io was derived from missionary teachings" in private correspondence rather than in an article or review.121 Why did Best accept Whatahoro's version of the teachings of the whare-wananga uncritically, especially given his earlier skepticism about Maori monotheism? First, Whatahoro's authority seemed to come in part from his apparent age, but this perception showed the credulity of the di- rector of the Dominion Museum, Augustus H. Hamilton.122 Second, de- spite Best's awareness that desired responses could be elicited by asking leading questions, he chose to overlook the fact that in his fieldwork he had obtained "totally different answers from Whatahoro, Tuta and others" by asking "the same questions within intervals of some months between questionings."123 Third, Sorrenson argues that Smith and Best were "se- duced" or "mesmerised by their informant, Whatahoro."124 Fourth, Best's presupposition that myth was encrusted history also played a part. Fifth, Best's own disenchantment with colonial Christianity undoubtedly pre- disposed him to romanticize Maori religion. Best accepted uncritically Whatahoro's rationalization that "if your missionaries sympathised with our people, and had patiently studied the cult of Io, instead of despis- ing and condemning our belief, that cult would have been incorporated with your Bible."125 Sixth, Best did not understand that the Maori view of the past was malleable and dependent on present conditions. Even if in nineteenth-century Maori society knowledge of the past was transmit- ted primarily through oral means rather than through writing, the histo- rian David Lowenthal has noted that in such cultures, "remembered truth was flexible and up to date, because no ancient custom could be proved 119 Published in the JPS as A.

Note the quite different wording in Craig, p. 168. 75</page><page sequence="27">Io as Supreme Being older than the memory of the oldest living wise man; hence there was no conflict between past and present practice."126 Besides these factors, there is the question of the relationship between texts and power, which has been assiduously overlooked both in the "history of religions" and later religious studies literature on Io. Best's position at the Dominion Museum was still temporary and the chief justification for making it permanent rested largely on Whatahoro's man- uscripts, which were still to be transcribed. Best's biographer showed that he was "caught between two stools in his relationship with Whatahoro." He made no secret of the fact that he doubted the credibility of the to- hunga, but he "certainly had no intention of abandoning his long-sought career of Maori studies." Given that he now had a young wife to support, who would probably outlive him by many years, he found it difficult to resist Percy Smith's "earnest plea not to condemn Whatahoro out of hand because of a few inaccuracies in his information."127 At another level of the relationship between texts and power, Io as now perceived by Best became a textual artifact which helped him to bind together much of his previous theorizing about "the Maori as he was." Despite the criticisms of Io in their private correspondence, Smith and Best published several defensive notes on Maori religion and on Io in the JPS over the next seven years. They regarded appeal to "ancient" or "neolithic" authority as sufficient to counter the claims that the Io reli- gion had been evolved over a short time-span by mission-trained Maori. In Best's next JPS article on Maori religion, "The Maori Concept of the Spirit World," Best rehearsed his awareness of the difficulties of ethno- graphic data gathering but adhered to his view that extant manuscripts on Maori religion gave an insight both into their beliefs in "pre-European times" and into Maori mentality.128 Best treasured the study of religious belief because it "affords us an insight into the mentality of a people such as cannot be gained through any other channel." Best's prime ex- hibit for this argument, Io, is strangely absent. He admitted the difficulty of ascertaining "the inner beliefs of an uncultured race" but dismissed texts that suggested Maori belief in a deluge or punishment of the soul after death as showing how long the Maori had been under missionary influence and teachings.129 Io escaped his identification of post-European creations. Smith defended Io within his own diffusionist framework in private correspondence to Best in September 1916: "It is quite impossible ... 126 David Lowenthal, The Past Is a Foreign Country (Cambridge: Cambridge Univer- sity Press, 1985), p. 231. 127 Craig, pp. 148, 149. 128 Elsdon Best, "The Maori Concept of the Spirit World," JPS 25, no. 100 (December 1916): 174. 129 Ibid., pp. 174, 175. 76</page><page sequence="28">History of Religions that the Maoris have evolved their Io from Biblical studies, for one thing they would have introduced Jesus Christ.... No! they have got the Io matter in very ancient days before the times of Jesus Christ, from some Babylonian Semites. It is only natural that the missionary element should account for Io from Biblical teaching because otherwise they would have to confess that the old Tohungas would not disclose a rival sect of their esoteric teaching. That was what really occurred in my opinion."130 Best speculated on a new variety of Pacific diffusionism to counter the private criticisms that Io was derived from missionary teaching. Some Tahitian visitors to Wellington in 1916 had given him place names, which he wrote up for a JPS article in 1917.131 The statement by one man that the principal god of their local pantheon "in past time was known as lo i te vahi naro (Io of the hidden place)" rang bells for Best with the Lore's lo of the hidden face, "the supreme god of the Maori folk of New Zealand."132 While some, no doubt from the missionary faction, might argue that "Tahitians must have invented practically the same name for a newly discovered supreme being, or that there has been collusion be- tween Maori and Tahitian in a pious fraud," Best advanced a romantic setting of immeasurable ages for this Io: "On the other hand these curi- ous theories may be quite wrong, and Io a genuine blue blooded atua from time immemorial, whose name was brought hither by the Maori with those of Tane, Tangaroa, and other gods. We know that missionary teachings have influenced the Maori, and that the present day native may mix native with Christian myths, but no Bible teaching resembles the old Maori account of the cult of lo."133 Since Best's working principle of missionary influence required veri- similitude, he could not recognize a process of adaptation. He assumed that any likeness between the beliefs of different Polynesian peoples must result from collusion, rather than demonstrating independent indigenous postmissionary religious vitality. A document dated 1913 and recently examined by Lyndsay Head contains a list that clearly shows that the "progress was not from Io to Ihoa (Jehovah), but rather, from Ihoa to 0o."134 As editor of the JPS, Smith continued to fuel speculation in the Io debate. Two years after postulating the familiar Semitic diffusion the- ory, he advanced an Assyrian connection. Given that Ernest Renan had claimed in his History of the People of Israel that the name of Iahoue or 130 Sorrenson, Manifest Duty, p. 38, citing Smith to Best, September 22, 1916 (MS Pa- pers 72, folder 5, Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, N.Z.). 131 Elsdon Best, "Some Place Names of Islands of the Society Group, Supplied by Na- tives of Those Isles at Wellington, in 1916," JPS 26, no. 103 (September 1917): 111-15. 132 Ibid., p. 114. 133 Ibid. 134 Head (n. 13 above), pp. 15, 16. 77</page><page sequence="29">lo as Supreme Being lahveh in primitive Assyrian belief became contracted to lahou or Io, Percy Smith argued for an Indian homeland of "the Maori." He then broke the male monopoly of European thought on Io, citing the views of the "well-known ethnologist" Anna Kingsford. Far from being a male progenitor, Io opened up new possibilities of conceptualizing divinity. The reader was told that Kingsford's "genius objected to the word God as meaning only the male principle. The only word that expresses the dual principle in God is lo."135 When Hare Hongi advanced a notion of Io that conflicted with the Smith/Best orthodoxy, Smith could not allow this to pass unchallenged. Smith prejudiced the reading of Hongi's 1920 JPS article with a com- plete page of editorial introduction. While Hongi agreed with the notion of the evolution of the gods at "some very remote period," the first figure in the Maori pantheon is not Io, but Rangi-atea, who is nevertheless endowed with many of the attributes reserved by European ethnologists for Io. Rangi-atea denoted "ClearSpace," "Light of Heaven," "Heavenly- Father," and "Sky Father."136 Hongi took Best's motif of the power of abstract thought to the point where Io was deprived of the possibility of being considered a deity, being a "purely abstract conception; an abstract conception of, perhaps, the Soul of Things."137 To counterattack, Smith published a translation of a letter written in 1908 by a Maori informant, Te Haupara-a-Tane, who described himself as Smith's pet or slave.138 Smith introduced the text with a one-and-a-half-page editorial section. In a mass of intertextuality, Smith claimed that the "first-rate Maori schol- ars" Judge Manning, John White, C. O. Davis, and C. E. Nelson knew as "fact" the name and some of the attributes of the "god Io." Furthermore, Tahitian and Rarotongan knowledge of Io "is evidence of the authority of this ancient cult."139 This is Smith's last editorial contribution to the Io debate. His textualization of "the Maori" may have earned him a cer- tain immortality, but his death passed on to Best the mantle of being the leading authority on "the Maori." The process of more substantial textualization of Io then began in ear- nest, culminating from 1922 to 1924 with the publication of five weighty 135 "On the name Io, the Supreme God of the Maoris," JPS 27, no. 106 (June 1918): 95.

Most of Best's monographs were to remain in print, even fifty years after their first publication.141 He popu- larized the notion of the hierarchy of gods in three divisions from the "higher grade" of tohunga, who was an exponent of "the aristocratic type of Maori religion" from which "common people" were excluded, right down to the "gross shamanism" of priests of "the lower-grade."142 The cosmogonic scheme in which Io played a part had been evolved by "the Maori" true to his mythopoetic nature and the ever-present human desire to know the origin and meaning of everything."143 Only anthropology had the power to initiate the general population into a fairer understand- ing of "the mentality, institutions and aspirations of folk of lower culture planes" revealed particularly in the beliefs of "primitive populations."144 Best indeed had been enticed by the possibility of "a new and attractive exploration into the depths of the human soul."145 While some critics might accuse Best of showing a lack of "concreteness," he reminded his readers with a touch of black humor that "perhaps we had better not en- large on the vagueness of Maori conceptions, for our own ideas of life in the upper spirit-world are by no means too clear, though that charge can- not be brought against certain teachings of life in the subterranean spirit- world, wherein, peradventure, some of us are booked for an extremely sultry time."146 Best itemized Io in lists and exuded an air of scientific detachment in presenting Io as prime exhibit in his argument for advanced Maori men- tality. It is not certain whether Best had in his mind the image of a Chi- nese seer as portrayed by James Frazer, or an English country gentleman: "This and other conceptions of a superior type must have been the crea- tion of leisured minds, of a priestly caste of a people dwelling as a co- hesive, self-contained nation in some far land....

He begat no being, but he was the origin of the universe and of the lower gods-he caused them to exist. There is no proof that Io was raised to primacy from a polytheistic system, or because he was a primal ancestor, or a great nature force, such as the sun. The concept bears the aspect of a metaphysical abstraction, the result of a speculative philosophy seeking a First Cause.148 Best made "the Maori" understandable in terms of a universal quest for meaning in life. His purpose was "to show how closely many Maori myths and beliefs resemble our own, so closely that we can scarcely afford to ridicule them if we bear in mind the old saying about glass houses. We are accustomed to looking upon such people as the Maori as being akin to savages, and yet we find that many of their concepts are the equal of our own. In his endeavours to seek the origin of the universe, of man, and the whence and whither of the human soul, the Maori has shown remarkable powers of introspective thought."149 The 1924 texts duplicate one another in many respects. The key phrase that recurs describes the commencement to traverse, or the taking of the first steps, or of the setting of the feet of "the Maori" on "the long path that leads to monotheism."150 The verb "leads" carries a certain determin- istic tone and inevitability. It also betrays Best's view that "the Maori" is incomplete. However much he may have argued that Christianity was a sect-ridden cultus that could not substitute for civil law, as had tapu, Best reveals that monotheism is the standard against which Maori religious belief is to be measured and to be valued. The repetition and the exhaus- tive lists of overseas authorities shows Best's insecurity in handling re- ligion in a text.151 He provided no extensive list of nonlocal authorities when textualizing Maori agriculture. Religion is treated with much more seriousness precisely because it did not readily yield to the same encap- sulating exactitude. It could also be argued that repetition set in after Best had lost the freshness of his field experience among the Tuhoe and felt the 147 Best, The Maori, 1:87. 148 Best, Some Aspects of Maori Myth and Religion, p. 24. 149 Best, Christian and Maori Mythology, p. 9. 150 See Best, Some Aspects of Maori Myth and Religion (n. 39 above), p. 10, The Maori, 1:87, and Maori Religion and Mythology (n. 139 above), p. 11. 151 See Best, Maori Religion and Mythology, pp. 3-7. 80</page><page sequence="32">History of Religions burden of recording "the Maori as he was" before he vanished forever from the face of the earth. Best tantalized his readers at the very point at which he is most spec- ulative: "In addition to the superior cult of Io, his nature forced him to believe in, and deal with, lower gods.... Although he had evolved the concept of a Supreme Being, had commended to traverse the long path that leads to monotheism, it may be said that Io is not the true God, that lo does not exist. That question we will not discuss."152 That Best was no Hebraist is clear from the following speculation: "It is just possible that the ancestors of the Maori brought the name of Io from an Asiatic home-land. In Renan's History of the People of Israel the author states that the name of Iahveh, or Iohoue, became contracted to Iahou, or Io. Of a verity it would be a startling discovery to find that Io is but a form of the name Jehovah. However, these far-off specula- tions are outside the present writer's province."153 Best has skillfully cre- ated new realms of possibility but covered himself in the process. A Hebraist would have known that Jehovah is a textual sign, composed of the consonants of the tetragrammaton, YHWH (;f1P) with the vowels of adonai. Io could only have been derived philologically from Jehovah if the Maori had transliterated from the pointed Hebrew text into their own written language. Best does not cite Tregear as an authority or allude to his claim that the Maori had written script at one stage, the only evi- dences subsequently being carving, a type of debased writing. Speculation in this manner allows Best to depict "the Maori" as not entirely foreign. He presents Jehovah as a cultural heritage, which both Maori and European have derived from the same source in antiquity. Directly echoing the final passages of Tregear's Aryan Maori, Best paints a romantic image of neatness, of the two races encircling the earth and coming back together again: "Now, we are told that the name of Jehovah assumed many different forms, as Jahweh, Yahweh, Iohoue, Iahou, and, finally Io. This is somewhat startling. Has the name of Jehovah been car- ried far westward, and the name of lo eastward, until the two met here in these lone isles at the end of the earth?"154 Diffusionist and assimilation- ist theories are indeed oddly juxtaposed in this passage. The metaphor overcomes confusion. However, Best is far more cautious when he du- plicates these ideas in The Maori. An almost identical passage bears the characteristic Bestian marks of certainty and tantalizing speculation: "Has the name of Jehovah been carried westward, and that of Io eastward, from a common centre, to meet here at the bounds of the earth? This is 152 Best, Some Aspects of Maori Myth and Religion, p. 10. 153 Ibid., p. 25. 154 Best, Christian and Maori Mythology (n. 139 above), p. 6. 81</page><page sequence="33">lo as Supreme Being but one of many striking Asiatic-Polynesian parallels that provide much pabulum for thinking minds. This, however, is not the time or place to discuss this attractive subject. One old Maori tradition gives the names of two primal gods, Io and Ha. Oriental scholars tell us that Ea, or Ia, or Aa, was identified with Ya, Yau, or Au, the Jah of the Hebrew."155 Io had become for Best an article of faith that engendered in him feel- ings of awe and wonder for "the Maori as he was." In a passage with a striking sense of orientalism, "the Maori" rises beyond the diffusionist aspect: "Ere long, he came to a conclusion, and one that causes the Eu- ropean mind to marvel. For the Maori, when in a metaphysical mood, shows the mentality of an Oriental mystic, and no man knoweth what strange fancies may emanate from the brain of Man the Neolith."156 Value was accorded "the Maori," therefore, not as an entity textualized by European writers, but as a window into European self-understanding. The old survivors of the nineteenth-century Maori way of life gave Best the hope of understanding the brain of neolithic European man. By look- ing at "the Maori," Europeans could see themselves in ancient guise. Best believed his ethnographic career had enabled him to show "the European as he was." The textualization of Io does not stop with Best. Best's later works so fixed the locus of Io in pre-European Maori religion that later writers found irresistible his philosophical framework, which had so vastly ex- panded Io's meaning. Best's anthropological triumph would be rehearsed again and again by international scholars wishing to prove an Urmono- theismus, a primitive monotheism. From 1922 the various Io cosmogonies discussed above became tex- tual authorities for scholars in the embryonic subject field of the history of religions, which needed to justify its existence in the academy. Gud- geon's text in particular, with its unmistakably Howittian echoes of "All Father," was the crucial published source in the development of this new academic enterprise. No less than fourteen major scholarly studies have devoted attention to this text, as shown by the following chronological listing: R. Pettazoni, Dio: formazione e sviluppo del monoteismo nella storia delle religioni (1922); C. Clemen, "Der sogennante Urmonothe- ismus der Primitiven" (1925); P. Radin, Primitive Man as Philosopher (1927); F R. Lehmann, "Io, die hbchste Gottheit der Maori" (1931); P. Radin, Primitive Religion (1937); R. Pettazoni, "Io and Rangi" (1950); M.

Eliade, Myth and Reality (1963), The Myth of the Eternal Return, revised and enlarged (1965), and From Primitives to Zen (1967).157 Of these Radin's Primitive Man as Philosopher was the most influential, particularly helping to raise the status of "primitive man." It took Io on a journey all around the world. The language of monotheism had so adhered to, if not inhered in, Io that the revisionist school of Polynesian scholarship has had little impact on those scholars working within the history of religions, as evidenced by the continued uncritical citing of Best, Eliade, and Irwin as textual authorities. After 1922 the Io debate shifted overseas. Given the wealth of the Io corpus, Io could now be textualized through books sitting on the shelves of academics at the Bishop Museum, Honolulu, and at Det Kon- gelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab in Copenhagen.158 Jonathan Z. Smith is only one of the more recent scholars to make claims to Io's place in Maori religion, based on his own speculations, rather than an understanding of classical Maori. THE TEXTUALIZATION OF IO: CONCLUSIONS What does this industry reveal? Is this a case of self-deception being practiced at the very highest levels of scholarship? Or does it reveal, rather, the power that print holds over literate peoples, and the preference of literate peoples for experience processed through print, as opposed to the wealth of alternative means human beings find to order raw chaotic reality? Clearly, the attempt to delineate, elucidate, clarify, and explain ren- dered the real Maori known in personal relationship superfluous and redundant. Pakeha New Zealanders could discover more about Maori re- ligion from texts on bookshelves than from Maori themselves, especially in the period before the Maori migration to cities from the mid-1940s. 157 Based on citations in J.

This corpus also speaks of the extent to which the primitive monotheism of a certain school of ethnologists and of the early historians of religion of this century was essentially an academically created myth, indispensable for the survival and growth of new academic disciplines in competitive and sometimes hostile intellectual environments. For all their protestations of advanced mentality, postmythopoeic thinking, objectivity, and impartial- ity, these text makers show themselves to be both myth creators and myth sustainers of the highest order. Their derived authority and outwardly impressive modes of discourse in an apparently "religionless" context render this mythmaking all the more subtle and pervasive. With the achievement of such canonicity, Io as supreme being could be proudly proclaimed by the more recent text makers of the post-1970s Maori renaissance. For Maori Marsden and James Irwin, Io seemed to be a relatively unproblematic entity or exhibit in an internationally validated case.159 While oral traditions on Io could never have survived unmodified this century, let alone in the last, the immortality of textual encapsula- tions on Maori religious beliefs has mediated to the writers of the Maori renaissance the "veridical" aspects of Maori religion complete with hid- den or overt philosophical frameworks. Of these, Irwin's text, which seems to contain "truth" in a diagram, thereby looking scientific, has been the most influential. Irwin rides roughshod over the critique, presenting Io as timeless. In a strange twist, this text has been highly influential in creat- ing a new folk theology or standard explanation of Maori spirituality. Given that Maori constitute only 10 percent of New Zealand's popula- tion, there is an immense need to posit an antique cult. The problem for scholars now is that Io has now become a Maori truth. The Io of history, that is, of the text makers, has now become the Io of faith. For Maori, the power of the printed word is enormous. Irwin is culpable in using his power over the dissemination of information in this way. Some Maori cannot afford to understand this intellectual colonization because they will lose all their certainties. Meanwhile, scholars at the University of Canterbury Maori Department are among the very few working on un- published manuscripts to create the corpus of primary texts. Only then can a new secondary industry be created on what the Maori thought. 159 Irwin, An Introduction to Maori Religion (n. 4 above), pp. 33-35; Maori Marsden, "God, Man and Universe: A Maori View," in Te Ao Hurihuri: The World Moves on. Aspects of Maoritanga, ed. Michael King, rev. ed. (Wellington: Hicks Smith, 1975; Auck- land: Reed, 1992), pp. 117-37. Marsden treats the Io cosmologies as veridical and draws freely on Best, without acknowledgment. See pp. 130-33. 84</page><page sequence="36">History of Religions This article has analyzed the hidden text that unites the Io corpus and gives it meaning: European religious concepts applied as the normative categories by which to measure and value all foreign peoples. The major text makers around the period of the textual encapsulation of Io as Supreme Being of the pre-European Maori all had in common a dis- affection with missionary Christianity and a desire to discover universal religious roots. However, no matter how hard the text makers may have tried, it is impossible to return to the "original reading" once a text has been created. The greatest irony is that Whatahoro, Best, Smith, and other text makers have shown in their Io hunting more clearly than ever the unbreakable hold of Eurocentric religious notions. The attempt of the Io hunters to locate the "other" reveals more of their own search for meaning after they had declared as spiritually bankrupt the sect-ridden religious mores of their own society. It is a "supreme" irony that the very texts that exalted and deified Io to a supreme position within the Maori pantheon at the very same time dehumanized the Maori through their reductionism. The complexity of Maori religion was controlled through hierarchical ordering, list making, and stratification. The savage mind was domesticated preeminently by Best's listings and categories, and therefore simultaneously raised to the level of being considered barbaric. Far from being descriptive or verid- ical terms corresponding to outwardly observable reality, the very use of such terms "barbaric" and "neolithic" has shown a prior drawing of on- tological and epistemological boundaries between "us" and them." The making of texts on Maori religion, and on Io in particular, has had consequences for both the Maori and the European. Textualization al- lowed the European to complete by 1924 the intellectual colonization of the most tantalizingly elusive aspect of Maori society: their inner beliefs on ultimate questions. Control had finally been asserted over the object of investigation, and Io as a religious exhibit joined the more tangible exhibits of Maori material culture, which had by now filled many clut- tered overseas ethnological museums. Mgori belief had "arrived" and met the stringent requirements for religious beliefs held by many Euro- pean scholars. The Other was valued insofar as its otherness could be controlled, contained, or even circumvented and vitiated. The Other was valued not in itself, or even as "object," but in the extent to which it re- vealed the primitive origins of the religious beliefs of the colonizer, the "subject." 85</page></plain_text>
