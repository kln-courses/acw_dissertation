Rice Department of Anthropology, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale IL 62901 Abstract Classic hieroglyphic texts do not describe Maya political organization, nor do colonial documents, forcing archaeologists to look elsewhere for clues. I propose that continuities in calendrically-based geopolitical rhetoric are recognizable in imagery and literary devices that can be traced from Preclassic/Formative times into the Colonial period. Imagery revolves around God K, k’awiil, and manikin scepters. The Classic manikin scepter materializes God K/K’awiil as a symbol of legitimate rulership, particularly at accession; the Postclassic analogue in the Dresden and Paris Codices is a God K effigy head, God K also symbolizing k’atuns. Related literary devices are kennings, specifically the took’-pakal or “flint-and-shield,”which appear in Classic texts and in the Chilam B’alam books in the context of defeat in warfare, the latter particularly referring to k’atun wars. Interrelated concepts, including obsidian, mirrors, serpents, and one- legged deities in the Popol Vuh and in Mexico (Tezcatlipoca), amplify these proposed continuities.

This organization is Surviving Classic and Postclassic period Maya texts are rich with known from the Late Postclassic northern lowlands (Edmonson symbolism, nuance, and polysemy, but also—for archaeologists 1979), but I propose earlier origins (Rice 2007a). Further, I who seek a clearer understanding of Maya social, political, and propose here that continuities in such organization can be recog- economic practices—annoying ambiguity. The lack of clarity is par- nized in subtle and elliptical literary devices—the language of meta- ticularly problematic in efforts to identify continuities in lowland phor, homophony, and synonymy—and also in iconography Maya civilization from its Preclassic beginnings through Classic traceable from Preclassic through Colonial period times. Clues are “collapse” and Postclassic and Colonial-period transformations. especially notable in paired oppositions, discernible as early as The Preclassic Maya generally lacked texts; the Classic Maya Middle Formative art (Reilly 1991) and later in verbal couplets created texts and elaborate imagery on stone monuments and known as “kennings” (diphrastic kennings, difracismos) that struc- painted pottery, but with subject matter limited to high elites; and tured Maya poeticized ritual discourse (Knowlton 2002). the Postclassic and Colonial period Maya left us almanacs and Specifically, k’atun-based geopolitical cycling can be identified “prophetic histories” written in a poetic style of discourse employ- through representations and manifestations of God K/K’awiil, ing couplets and metaphors, highly allusive and maddeningly manikin scepters, and the “flint-and-shield” trope. impenetrable.

In Preclassic/Formative period at least into the sixteenth century addition, God K is also known as Unen K’awiil, the infantile GII of (see Coggins 1988, 1990; Kelley 1965; Milbrath 1999:227–240, the Palenque Triad (Robertson 1979), and as Tojil, patron deity of 2002; Miller and Taube 1993:110; Robicsek 1979; Schele and the Postclassic K’iche Maya of the Guatemalan highlands. Miller 1983:9–20; Schele and Miller 1986:49; Stone and Zender In his manifestation as a manikin scepter, Maya God K/K’awiil 2011:49; Stuart 1987:15–16; Taube 1992:69–79). The God K bears strong resemblances to the central Mexican black Tezcatlipoca complex is primarily celestially oriented, taking as its domain deity, identified by a smoking mirror in his temple and a serpent storms, lightning, and sky, the last including ancestors, celestial or foot, who is symbolic of legitimate rulership (Carlson 1981:125; vision serpents (typically shown conjuring or dancing), and the Coe 1973:116; Milbrath 1999:230–231; Miller and Taube 1993: planets, especially Jupiter. Perhaps most significantly, God K/ 165; Olivier 2003; Valencia Rivera 2006). Tezcatlipoca and God K’awiil is the patron of royal dynasties and bloodlines (Stuart 1988). K/K’awiil share both feline and ophidian associations (Valencia Iconographically, God K is primarily recognized by his large, Rivera 2006), although Tezcatlipoca is more commonly linked to decorated, up-turned nose or snout, and a smoking ax, celt, cigar, jaguars (especially the Jaguar God of the Underworld; see Miller mirror, or torch on the forehead or temple. In the Classic period and Taube 1993:164) and K’awiil to serpents (Taube 1992: he is known epigraphically as K’awiil, which means “statue” or 73–75). The serpent is the way (spirit companion, “co-essence;” “god” in K’iche’an languages (Schele and Fahsen 1991) and “sus- the nagual) of K’awiil (Houston and Stuart 1989:8). tenance” in Yukatekan (Stuart 1987:15–16; alimento: Barrera God K’s celestial associations, besides lightning and storms, Vásquez 1980). God K is a patron of rulers as guarantors of appear to concentrate on the planet Jupiter, the second brightest cosmic sustenance through sacrifice and bloodletting. He appears star after Venus. Milbrath (1999:230, 2002) links GII to Jupiter in the Classic period as the “manikin scepter” (Figure 1) with the intervals and GII’s birthday, a day 1 Ajaw, is frequently associated above attributes, plus an elongated leg with a serpent head as the with Jupiter events (Thompson 1960). God K/K’awiil has been said foot. This scepter, a personified ax (Looper 2003:104), is displayed to “embody” (Milbrath 1999:239) the planet Jupiter, especially in by Classic rulers at accession. retrograde. Over time he came to be associated with the temporal God K is closely related to other Maya deities, particularly God cycles of k’atuns because their endings in the Classic period are B/Chaak and the concept of rain as a life-giving force. God K also often related to recurrent positions of Jupiter and Saturn. God K is the main protagonist of the poorly understood 819-day count, perhaps developed at Palenque (Aldana 2007), which tracks the movements of Jupiter and Saturn and in which the deity tours the four cosmic quarters. Aldana (2007:112, 117, 164) also connects K’awiil with the planets Mars and Mercury. In all these incarnations and manifestations, the fundamental— albeit complexly multilayered—connection is with royal lineage and divine legitimization, embodying a ruler’s power and responsi- bilities with respect to ensuring nourishment of the soil, of the people, and of cosmic time. Preclassic Precursors In keeping with the proposition that deity clusters have multiple themes and domains, it is likely that God K’s muliple roles accrued over time, and some of the Classic and Postclassic God K/K’awiil attributes can be traced back to Middle Formative icono- graphy and the accoutrements of Olmec lords. For example, Classic themes of kings’ bloodletting and the invocation of ancestors might be traced back to La Venta Stela 2 (Stuart 1988:221). The ambigu- ous feline-ophidian-reptilian characteristics of various entities in Formative, particularly Olmec, art might have been the source for both Tezcatlipoca and K’awiil, with Tezcatlipoca/feline a later Mexican transformation out of K’awiil/serpent (Valencia Rivera Figure 1.

Mirrors were likely used as instruments of conjuring and divination, but the reflections they cast also hinted at another world which could be peered into but not physically entered; as such, mirrors represented “passageways for the supernatural” (Miller and Taube 1993:115). The “flame eyebrow” of the Olmec were-jaguar supernatural, which appears as an icon on widely occurring Middle Formative objects, might have been a precursor to the smoking forehead mirror of the later God K. Or, stated differently, perhaps the profiled image of the were-jaguar with the flame eyebrow, projecting upper lip/snout, fangs, and swept-back cleft head is a predecessor of a rain/storm- lightning/maize god complex, including God K/K’awiil (an association hinted at by Reilly [1991]). God K’s serpent foot has origins in the “Olmec kings who depicted their lower legs as crocodile heads, to symbolize their status as the World Tree” (Freidel et al. 1993:196). The heavily incised “Young Lord” (a.k.a. “Slim”) serpentine figurine cradles two scepters (one probably a bloodletter), a pair of Olmec symbols of authority, in arms clasped inward over his chest (Reilly 1991; Joralemon 1996a). Each forearm is embellished with a human figure with elongated legs, and from one foot of each figure emerges the head of a “were-jaguar” supernatural. The Young Lord’s feet are likewise ornamented with the heads of supernaturals. Ax-like greenstone celts, generally thought to have associations with corn and lightning, are frequently incised with Olmec symbols of rulership. One shows an individual carrying a horizontal bundle that looks like the forerunner of a Maya serpent bar, with a corn plant growing from the cleft in its head (Joralemon 1996b:269) (Figure 2). God K’s later identification with maize (Taube 1992: 78)—and the celt embedded in his forehead—might be linked to this early imagery. Slightly later, Izapa Stela 3 shows a standing figure brandishing a curved stick, with a smoking torch on the fore- head and a possible serpent foot (Taube 1992:76n7). In the Maya lowlands, the murals of San Bartolo, in northeastern Peten, date to roughly 150 b.c. and display certain generalized Middle Formative (“Olmec”-like) traits, particularly the facial fea- tures of the humans or supernaturals. In particular, the left-most figure on the North wall exhibits several striking features that not only call to mind Olmec representations but also later Chaak and God K. The masked figure faces left, cradling in his left arm two curved sticks, with his right arm upraised. His face has an elongated snout that emanates smoke or breath scrolls. A shield on his brow with an emerging serpent may represent a (smoking?) mirror. On Figure 2.

Classic Period: K’awiil and Manikin Scepter In the southern lowlands, God K/K’awiil-related imagery appears as the manikin scepter (Miller and Martin 2004:Plate 3). in the Early Classic period in objects displayed by rulers. For Commonly represented on monuments in the south, God K scepters example, on the unprovenienced Leiden Plaque, which refers to also appear in the northern lowlands, for example, at Edzna, Uxmal the seating of a ruler in a.d. 320, God K is shown emerging from (Stelae 2 and 6), Dzibilchaltun (Stela 9 and 19), Oxkintok, Sayil a serpent’s maw on the right side of a double-headed serpent bar (Stela 5), and Ek’ B’alam (Stela 1).

The snake dance is commonly depicted on ning in the Early Classic (see Martin and Grube 2008). Classic polychrome pottery, especially on “Holmul Dancer plates” Calakmul’s rulers appropriated K’awiil as part of their names for and Codex-style vessels that show God K/K’awiil appearing as, much of the eighth century after Tikal’s “defeat” of that city in or on, the tail of the “conjuring snake” (och chan) entwined with a.d. 695 (Martin and Grube 2008:112). For unknown reasons, the Snake Lady and the Old God (Grube 1992:212–213, dynasties in the western Usumacinta region—Palenque, 214–215). This character is associated with transformation rites, Yaxchilan, Piedras Negras, Tonina—did not use the K’awiil particularly emergence from the maw of the Vision Serpent, and epithet.

Secondary texts reveal that each named deity is associated with an Emblem Postclassic: K’awiil, God K, K’atuns, and Texts Glyph: 6 Sky with Calakmul, 10 Chuen (monkey) with Machaquila, and Ix Balam (water-lily jaguar) with Tikal (Coe In the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic periods in Yucatan, 1978:96; Milbrath 1999:247). God K appears on Fine Orange pottery of the Sotuta complex and As on this “Holmul-style” vase, k’awiil dancers often may be on various sculptures at sites in the Puuc area (Milbrath 1999:230, identified with Emblem Glyphs, or the verb “to dance” (ahk’ot) fol- 2002:119; Taube 1992:69).

In the places?” Responding in the affirmative, Ana García Barrios and Postclassic, God K is frequently represented by his head (often Rogelio Valencia Rivera (2007) suggest, although not particularly appearing in a headdress) and lacking the serpent foot. For convincingly, that this might relate to political affiliations with example, he appears in the headdress of a diving figure on Stela 5 Calakmul. A different interpretation comes from Aldana (2007: at Flores (Taube 1992:69, 73), possibly dated to 11.8.10.0.0, 109), who identifies k’awiil-associated places (k’awiil-nal) as the (a.d. 1392) (Barrios 2009).

On Page 65 God B carries a God K head in his hand; and on Page 67 he carries an image of God K in a bag tied to his arm (Figure 6c). These last depictions are analogous to God K’s central role in the Paris Codex and in k’atun ceremonies—and also Classic imagery (“taking the k’awiil,” the manikin scepter)—in which the transfer of a God K head to a new ruler signals “a change in political or reli- gious authority” (Milbrath 1999:230). The k’atun pages of the Paris Codex, which was apparently painted in Late Postclassic Mayapan as a copy of a Late/Terminal Classic period manuscript (Vail Figure 4. One of four wooden effigies of God K/K’awiil, of blue-painted 2006:504), show the lord of the k’atun seated on a skyband stucco, found in the interment of “Animal Skull” (ca. a.d. 600), in Temple throne and receiving the God K effigy head symbolic of accession 32, North Acropolis, Tikal.

This role also supports the possibility that, manikin scepter was held by the Xiw patriarch in the 1557 during the Late Classic period in the southern lowlands, rulers drawing of the Xiw family tree (Cortez 2002:202; Miller and who carried the manikin scepter or deployed other God K/ Taube 1993:110).

In general, turtles are more associations with war/conflict and transition, particularly on commonly associated with Pawahtun, the aged God N (Miller and k’atun endings and the end of the thirteenth b’ak’tun in 2012, as Taube 1993:148). on Tortuguero Monument 6 (Eberl and Prager 2005:31; With Spanish conquest and the imposition of Christianity, God Gronemeyer and MacLeod 2010:24; see also Houston 2008). K/K’awiil underwent further transformations. In the Chilam “Yokte’” is difficult to translate. Te’ is a numerical classifier, but B’alam of Chumayel, Chac-xib-chac, the Red Rain god and/or yok may have many meanings in Yukatekan: as a noun, “knife, ruler of Chichen Itza, was “despoiled of his insignia.” Ralph Roys pointed tip”; as a verb, “to pierce or perforate” (Barrera Vásquez (1967:67) proposed that this “insignia” (translated from the odd 1980:979).

The “nine generations” might not be literal, biological, human generations but rather a metaphor for the “layered” calendrical cycles of k’atuns (the nine turtle-ajaws in Dzibichen?), the may, the b’ak’tun, or even the seemingly “endless” Great Cycle itself—all flowing in their “wholeness” from end to end—and for the sequential lords of these periods, who ritually complete them. KENNINGS: TOOK’-PAKAL ‘FLINT AND SHIELD’ The kenning u took’ u-pakal ‘his flint, his shield’ (Houston 1983) (Figure 3c) is commonly interpreted as a metaphor for or insignia of war.

The flint or took’ incorporates reference to chipped stone knives or spear points of chert and obsidian, as well as the unusual forms rulers frequently display three emblems—the God K scepter/ax, known as “eccentrics” (Stone and Zender 2011:83). Eccentric a round shield, and a mosaic “sak-pectoral”—which may be tied flints and obsidians are commonly recovered archaeologically in to (k’atun-) period-ending ceremonies (Looper 2003:103–106, dedicatory caches in buildings and under stelae, but rarely in 133, 141). tombs. Many eccentrics are chipped to create profiles of God K/ The shields in these images are also of interest. On those of the K’awiil, the serpent-footed god (Miller and Martin 2004:Plates Palenque ancestors and the Quirigua kings, the shield often displays 78–82; Schele and Miller 1986:Plates 25, 26, 114) (see the face of the Jaguar God of the Underworld, associated with the Figure 7a). Twelve such objects, eccentrics depicting K’awiil, night sky and war (and also Tezcatlipoca). In these representations, were found in the Early Classic Rosalila structure at Copan the God K scepter and the jaguar shield can be seen as emblems of (Sharer and Traxler 2006:45, Figure 13.7). The association two deities of the so-called Palenque Triad, GII and GIII, respect- between flint/obsidian and God K is paralleled in Tezcatlipoca, ively. The association between GIII and shields may come from whose avatar, Itztli, is translated as “obsidian” (Olivier 2003). the sign (T594/XD2) b’alb’a ‘shield’ (Milbrath 1999:102, citing These entangled meanings might relate to a belief that flint Kelley 1976:6; Macri and Looper 2003:180), connecting GIII and (took’) and obsidian (toh) were produced by lightning strikes the Underworld (Xib’aalb’a).
