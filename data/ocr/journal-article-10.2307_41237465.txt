A short episode in Lucian's True Histories describes Lychnopolis, the City of Lamps, where animated household lamps congregate in an orderly so- ciety. This article argues that these lamps symbolize household slaves, and that their society innovates on a long tradition of animated and personified lamps in Greek literature to expose and confirm the hazards and uncertainties regarding the presence, knowledge, and rational thinking of slaves. The astonishing order of the city invalidates a commonplace of slaveholder ideology, that slaves lacked the rational capability to govern their own lives. ôoùXoi yap emGTavTcu кш каХа кш aÍG^pá. (Onos 5) For slaves have the knowledge of good and shameful things alike.1 This sentiment, a reflection of Lucius, the free- at this point- protagonist of the Pseudo-Lucianic Ass, encapsulates the perspective on slave knowledge that governs this article. It applies broadly to the litera- tures of virtually all cultures in which domestic servants are common.2 In the Lucianic context, the Greek-speaking eastern Roman Empire of the second century, this literary apothegm is illuminated both by the practices of controlling slaves throughout the empire and by the ideas regarding slavery transmitted by literary and philosophical texts. From the former we see especially the ubiquity of slaves in the household, diverse types of slaves, and widely varying opinions regarding their treatment and their status in the familia and before the law.3 The latter speak not only to Lucian's erudition and philosophical interests but also to his theories of literature, salient in the True Histories (VH).4 Many primary sources highlight extremes of violence perpetrated 'Translations are mine except where noted. 2 See Bakhtin 1981, 124-24; Robbins 1993, 103-12. 3 Bradley 1987 remains the classic study of these and other issues. 4The VH has a close relationship to Lucian's treatise on historiography, How to Write History (Quomodo historia conscribenda sit).

The examples from Lucian and other Greek authors that I analyze here comprise, for the most part, idealized situations if not outright fan- tasies: Lucian's True Histories is set up as a compilation of outrageous lies; Aristophanes' Assemblywomen stages the infiltration of the ekklësia by women; the epigrams imaginatively capture dramatic moments in love affairs; Lucian's Downward Journey invents a tyrant's trial in the Underworld. I close with a brief mention of the reception of Lucianic lamps in the Italian Renaissance. Despite the fiction of all of these texts, they speak to this simple truth about servants: if they do not know their masters' secrets, the masters find it easy to believe that they do. The span of literature treated in this article indicates that I am more interested in the lamp as a literary motif than in the historical contingencies of each text, but I find it significant nonetheless that an image used by Aristophanes could have virtually the same valence for Lucian centuries later. For slave- owners who were guilty of some crime, this belief in the knowledge of their slaves could induce fear; for others whose actions compromised only their morals the witness of slaves could produce anxiety or humiliation.7 By transferring the service of slaves to inanimate lamps, Aristophanes' heroine Praxagora and the lovers of epigram could be assured of their 5McKeown 2007, 64-69, summarizes the main sources. See Hopkins 1993, 7-10, for an overview of anecdotes of cruelty towards slaves. 6 Bradley 1994, 167-72, cautiously examines the evidence that judicial torture may have decreased under the Antonine and Seveřan emperors, concluding that measures towards improving slave life apply to principles more than practice. 7McKeown 2007, 47, responding to Garrido-Hory 1981, makes the point that in the poems of Juvenal (9.102-21) and Martial (2.82, 11.38, 12.24) only the guilty need fear their slaves; presumably guilt would have judicial as well as moral implications. Harrill 2003, 240-41, also discusses the Juvenal passage and others to find resolution between conflicting views of slave autopsy in Christian apologists. Frustration with anxiety in literary approaches to slavery is apparent in Bradley 2001, 476, who doubts that "all slave-owners were constantly wracked by neurosis, as the all-pervasive language of 'anxieties' suggests."

LAMPS AND SLAVES ènei тюте èanépa KaTeXaußavev rjuãç, ö uév tic; eXeyev "яш, Xuxvíov." (Athenaeus 15.699d) When evening came upon us, one man said, "Slave, bring a lamp." The conjunction of lamp and slave in the simple command pai, lychnion recorded in Athenaeus' Deipnosophistae initiates a discussion of words for light-sources, with the etymologies, instances, and nuances of each lamp-related word explored. A similar order ends this discussion, with the character Cynulcus calling upon a slave to fetch an as' worth of candles (emoi de, pai dõrodeipne, assariou kandëlas priõ, 15.701b), scor- ing the last points in the intellectual game. Cynulcus repeats the simple juxtaposition of lamp and slave, but his parting shot is clever and curious in a number of ways. The terms handele and assarion are derived from Latin, while the vocative dõrodeipne ("waiter") is a hapax legomenon. Thus he adds a new item to the litany of light-related words, one that in its etymology and immediate context acknowledges the influence of Rome on these Greek-speaking intellectuals.9 The call to the slave brings the conversation full circle yet also innovates: the neologism dõrodeipne is paired with the commonest slave vocative, pai. Cynulcus may merely be preparing an elaborate gesture for his exit, but his attempt to adorn an everyday command with literary diction also reminds his fellow ban- queters as well as Athenaeus' audience that a slave, even if called upon with elegant and innovative language, is still a slave. This section of the Deipnosophistae begins with a juxtaposition of lamp and slave expressed very simply; it ends with much more esoteric terms for both, but the juxtaposition is still there.10 8This is the term of Harrill (2003, 241), following the work of Feldherr and others. For a brief but excellent discussion of the paradoxical combination of dehumanizing slaves yet relying on their deliberative capacities, see McCarthy 1998, 180-82. 9 Compare the tussle between Ulpian and Cynulcus over Latin in Greek (3.121e-f) and Braund 2000, 20-21. 10 Since lamps must be carried, fetched, removed, tended, lit, and extinguished by slaves, this pairing in classical literature is quite common. For example, the household slave</page><page sequence="4">208 SONIA SABNIS My contention is that ancient Greek writers were well aware of the assimilation implicit in commands like pai, lychnion, that for the most part they found in the ubiquitous artifact of the lamp not just a powerful symbol of light and vision but also a humble and inanimate substitute for their domestic slaves. Following the work of Bowersock and Swain on Lucian, I argue that Lucian's unique social satire engages the problem of this symbolism that Athenaeus' banqueters artfully elude.11 Lucian satirizes, in a brief episode in the True Histories, the symbolic role that lamps play throughout Greek literature. In the midst of other fantastic journeys, Lucian and his companions visit Lychnopolis, the City of Lamps. This encounter with animated lamps forms a short, self-contained episode in the novella, one with deep literary and philosophical resonance. I read the imaginative and fantastic qualities of the Lychnopolis as the indica- tors of the systematic ways that slaveowners repressed the cognitive and deliberative capacities of their slaves, both in theory and in practice. As narrator of the True Histories, Lucian tells lies, and the satirical, philosophical, and metanarrative aspects of this mendacity are the usual focus of scholars who have written on this work.12 In his Prologue, Lucian derides the obvious fabrications that fill the works of poets, historians, and in Aristophanes' Clouds is responsible for the lamp, and speaks and is spoken to with re- spect to this office (18 and 56-59). In Plato's Symposium, Alcibiades attributes his boldness in his attempted seduction of Socrates to the light having gone out and to the absence of slaves (218b-c). Dio refers to the subservience of Cyrus by calling him the lampbearer of Astyages {Or. 15.22; Hercher emended luchnopoios [mss.] to luchnophoros). Cf. also Luke 12.35-37. My point is that both Athenaeus and Lucian wish to impress, somewhat wryly, the social significance of such a household commonplace. 11 My critical approach to Lucian, seeing social commentary in a fictional entertain- ment, is informed by the following statement of Bowersock 1994, 4-6: "So Lucian's True Stories are meant clearly as a literary entertainment in the first instance. As he wrote in his opening lines, serious literary people ought to relax from time to time with 'such works as not only afford wit, charm, and distraction, pure and simple, but also provoke some degree of cultured reflection. . . . Now cultured reflection points to a more serious aspect of the fantastic tales that Lucian has cheekily chosen to designate True Stories. The one thing they are not is true. . . . Lucian tries to pull down the distinction between fiction that we accept as fiction and fiction that is presented as a record of real events. Everything, by his own admission, is lies. Yet what Lucian describes inevitably reflects, all too obviously, the world in which he lives." Swain 1996, 312, consistently makes a point of Lucian's unique cultural point of view as a Greek-speaking Syrian in the Roman Empire: "this relative isolation might explain why Lucian does stand as a critical commentator on the culture of his contemporaries, observing its strengths and weaknesses, praising its good points and merits, and relentlessly probing its vanities and pretensions." 12 Anderson 2003; Georgiadou and Larmour 1994 and 1995; Laird 2003; Nickel 1999; Riitten 1997;Tifernate 1998.</page><page sequence="5">LUCIAN'S LYCHNOPOLIS 209 philosophers, citing Odysseus' fabulous narrative as the prime example. Then he declares that his own narrative is nothing but lies, so his readers should not believe them at all.13 This iteration of the Epimenides Paradox, "all Cretans are liars," has important implications for the narratological and philosophical interpretations of the True Histories. u A paradoxical beginning lends itself to interpreting the work with an eye to truth, for despite the wondrous and fictional nature of the events in the True His- tories, each adventure shows the imprint of some real institution or social dynamic or philosophy.15 While the interpretation of Lychnopolis that I propose here is primarily that of social critique, not philosophical satire or literary experiment, it is not incompatible with more philosophical or literary readings that address the whole work. The Lychnopolis episode is brief, lacking the sex, violence, and monstrosity that characterize others in the True Histories (1.29):16 яХеисгаутес ôè ir'v émouaav vúktci кш r||iépav, ттер! éanépav à(piKÓ|i£0a èç TT]v AuxvÓTToXiv KaXou[iévrjv, rjôrj tòv катсо hXoùv Ôiiókovteç. ř' ôè kóXiç сиЗтт] k£îtcu (ietaÇù той nXeiáôcov кш Toû'Yaôcov àépoç, TcmeivoTépa uévtoi ttoXù too ((pôiaKoû. &lt;btoßavT£c Ôè avôpamov [ièv oùôéva eüpouev, Xúxvouç Ôè tcoXXoùç K£pi9éovTcu; кш év Tfj àyopa кш яер! xòv Xijiéva oiaTpißovtac;, toùç [lèv [incpoùç кш tuQTiep TrévrjTaç, òXíyouç ôè xtov ueyáXiüv кш ôuvattõv návu Хацяроис кш Hepi(pav£u;. oiKTìasic; Ôè aÙToïç кш Xi^vetoveç iôía екаатср пгпо'щухо, кш cukoì òvó(iata eîxov, шакер oí äv0pwKOi, кш 9a)vr]v Hpoïe(ièvu)v г|К01)0Ц£ч кш oùôèv r|[iãc; qôÍKOuv, àXXà кш ènl Çévia ¿KáXouv- гщеТс; Ôè оцюс; ефороицеба, кш оите ôemvfjaai оте ÚKvtõaaí tic r''iCbv ¿TÓX|ir|a£v. àpxeïa ôè aÙTOîç èv [ièor' Tfj KóXei яеяо1Г|та1, ëv0a ó äpx^v aÙTtuv ôià vdktòç oXrjc; Ká0r|Tai òvojiaaTÌ 13 On this point, see Branham 1989, 211-12, and Jones 1986, 52-53. Jones focuses on the literary aspects of the VH that prevent it from being "otherworldly or scholastic" (54). 14 For the philosophical approach, see Georgiadou and Larmour 1998a and 1998b passim. Their interpretation is stated clearly: "The main purpose of the exercise in Lu- cian's case is to present, scrutinize, and ridicule the explanations of the world offered by philosophers" (1998a, 48). See also Ligota 2007. 15 Georgiadou and Larmour follow through with their philosophical angle in the case of the Lychnopolis episode, offering the following explanation, tenable but blunt: "The Lamps are souls or accompaniments of souls. The extinction of the lamp is the punishment of the soul. The episode also plays on the tradition of Diogenes the Cynic going about with a Xúxvoç" (150). While the philosophical associations of light are certainly germane to the Lychnopolis episode, I prefer to focus on the physical lamps, not the transcendent light they bear. 16 1 contend that the Lychnopolis episode stands out among the other wondrous episodes of hybrids and monsters; its relatively mundane qualities may be one reason it is generally neglected in studies of the VH. On the fantastic qualities of the VH and their precursors, see esp.

Sailing the next night and day, we reached the place called Lychnopolis in the evening, pursuing a downward course. This city lies between the space of the Pleiades and that of the Hyades, but much lower than the Zodiac. Disembarking, we found not a single person but many lamps rushing about and hanging out in the agora and around the harbor, some small, as if they were poor, a few very bright and distinguished, the lamps of great and pow- erful people. The lamps have made homes for themselves, each one his own; they have names, just like people, and we heard the sound of them talking. They did no wrong to us, but even offered us hospitality; nevertheless we were afraid, and not one of us dared to eat or sleep. They have a public building in the middle of the city, where the archon sits through the whole night calling each lamp by name. Whoever does not respond is sentenced to death for leaving his station. Death means being extinguished. Standing nearby we watched what happened and we heard lamps apologizing and stating the reasons why they were late. I recognized our own lamp there as well, and addressing him I inquired how things were at home. He told me everything. We stayed there that night, but the following day we set sail towards the clouds. The downward course (ton katõ ploun) by which the travelers arrive at Lychnopolis punningly forges a distinct connection with Lucian's own Downward Journey (Kataplous) which depicts the trial of a tyrant in the court of Hades. This affinity, however, is somewhat strange, since Lychnopolis is located in the heavens, far from the Underworld of the Downward Journey, and the voyage of the True Histories is more or less an upward journey. The site in the heavens is appropriate to a city of lamps, which in literature are sometimes invoked as microcosmic representations of the celestial lights. Yet the city, reached by a downward course, is also described as much lower (tapeinotera) than the Zodiac. The city is both high and low, an ambiguity that complicates the relative social positions of the lamps and of Lucian and his companions, who are altogether unsure of how to respond to the society of their domestic helpers.17 17 Cf. Georgiadou and Larmour 1998a, 151. Their suggestion is that the word tapei- notera "has the meaning of 'baser' in terms of morals or character . . . and clearly suggests that the travelers are coming closer to the region of the physical body and its desires."</page><page sequence="7">LUCI ANS LYCHNOPOLIS 211 These domestic helpers are personified, speaking lamps, who travel from their homes on earth and maintain the social institutions and hier- archies of the world whence they come: they have an archon who takes attendance and confers death sentences by extinguishing those lamps that are out of order. Lamps that arrive late defend themselves, stating the reasons for their tardiness. Although Lucian and his men are received hospitably, an uncertain fear prevents them from eating or sleeping in the city. This is the first time in the True Histories that the travelers are fearful - the first time the verb phobeisthai is used.18 The novelty of this response is remarkable, given that their previous, fear-free encoun- ters include the hybrid Vinewomen, who seduce and trap men during copulation, and the bizarre armies of the Moon and Sun who engage in fierce combat.19 The citizens of Lychnopolis are hybrids of a strange but threatening variety: lamps with human voices and human institutions, the animated versions of inanimate domestic objects.20 They symbolize not souls, or at least not just souls, but slaves who find a refuge from their masters' world. Such an interpretation explains Lucian's fear better than approaches through philosophy or science fiction; the assimilation of lamp and slave clarifies the political aspects of Lychnopolis as well as the literary connections between Lychnopolis and lamps found in other texts. As I will show, Lychnopolis is nevertheless unique in that the fear- ful response of the human visitors is both linked with the dehumanizing control tactics of slaveowners and appropriate to the genre of the True Histories, famous for its commitment to indeterminacy.21 We know very little about Lucian's life, though there is certainly enough evidence from the places where he is supposed to have lived and lectured (Commagene, Asia Minor, Rome, Egypt) to suggest that his knowledge of slavery could draw on various experiences. Lucian's '"This is also the main point of Riitten 1997, 87. He explains the fear as follows: "Als Erklärung für dieses ängstliche Unbehagen mag der besondere Charakter eines ganz bestimmten Schauderns dienen, das den Menschen ergreift, wenn gerade die von ihm als Instrumente benutzten und vollständig kontrollierten Gegenstände des alltäglichen Lebens sich mit einem Mal als nicht mehr unbeherrschbar und in ein nicht menschliches, gespen- tisches Gefüge eingebunden erweisen." Rütten does not make a connection with slaves but cites a long literary tradition of household objects coming to life. 19These events are also described with an insouciance that is lacking in the Lych- nopolis episode. 2()We could also compare the aquarian brooms of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, a story that has its origin in Lucian's Lover of Lies. 21 The novella ends with a promise to narrate subsequent events in succeeding books that do not exist. This is, as the scholiast notes, the biggest lie of all (pseudestaton).

Philosophies for Sale, for instance, presents celebrity philosophers as slaves on the auction block; as in so many of Lucian's satires, the target is the abuse, distortion, and corruption of true philosophy by a mass of pretenders and sophists. From the beginning, the humor of the piece depends on the reader's gradual but definite recognition of the elements of slave auction: Zeus instructs an attendant to prepare the room and the wares, to groom the "lives" so they will look more attractive to buyers, and Hermes uses abundant mercantile language, including the rare polëtërion ("sales room," Vit. Auct. I).23 As if in accordance with the Edict of the Curule Aediles on slave sales, the natal origins of each philosopher-type are cited: the Cynic, for example, is introduced as Pontie (Diogenes came from Sinope on the Black Sea).24 The buyers make more direct refer- ences to slavery, including the illegality of selling someone who is free (andrapodismos).25 The piece ends with the sale of the Skeptic, who claims that he can do everything but apprehend a runaway slave on account of his inability to apprehend anything. The buyer of the Skeptic calls him his slave (oiketës) and threatens to send him to the mill (es ton mulõnd) if he does not cooperate (27). 26 In addition to his everyday experience of slavery in the Roman Empire, Lucian would have known Aristotle's complex theories of slav- ery.27 Aristotle argues in several places for an analogy between master/ 22 Syria was the most important source of slaves in the eastern empire, according to Harris 1999, 74. Lucian certainly would have been familiar with the plays of New Comedy in which Syrus is a common slave name. One wonders what he would have thought of the comment Cicero attributes to his grandfather (Or. 2.265): "Our people are like Syrian slaves: the better they know Greek, the more useless they are" (nostros homines similis esse Syrorum venalium: ut quisque optime Graece sciret, ita esse nequissimum). 23This word appears only once more in Lucian, in the sequel to Philosophies for Sale, the Fisherman. Diogenes complains that the philosophers were led to the sale-room like slaves (kathaper ta andr apoda paragagõn hëmas epi to polëtërion, 27). For an overview of slave sales tactics and auctions, see Bradley 1987, 115-18. 24On the Edict of the Curule Aediles, see Wiedemann 1981, 108; Bradley 1987, 61. 25This practice also informs the plot of The Double Indictment (Bis Ace. 13, 16). 26The phrase es ton mulona is easily recognizable as a proverbial threat against the most recalcitrant of slaves. It is similarly significant that in the Fisherman the false philosophers are to be apprehended and then branded like runaway slaves (46). For some historically oriented observations on slavery in Lucian, see Bradley 1994, 115, 119-20, 137. 27 Aristotle's notoriously complex theories of slavery.

Tools can be divided into animate and inanimate . . . property is a collec- tion of such tools, and a slave is an animate piece of property. ... If thus shuttles wove and quills played harps of themselves, master-craftsmen would have no need of assistants, and masters no need of slaves. Now the tools mentioned are instruments of production, whereas an article of property is an instrument of action; for from a shuttle we get something else beside the mere use of the shuttle, but from a garment or a bed we get only their use. And also inasmuch as there is a difference in kind between production and action, and both need tools, it follows that those tools also must possess the same difference. But life is doing things, not making things; hence the slave is an assistant in the class of instruments of action.28 Unfortunately Aristotle did not use lamps in his examples. Lamps pro- duce light but assist activity, so it is unclear how they would fit into his scheme. Insofar as lamplight reflects celestial light, the lamp, when lit, gives the appearance of a connection with an element superior to the rudiment of its material (clay or metal). This complexity is precisely why the lamp is a fitting slave symbol, for the slave, too, may contain a higher element, a rational soul, despite the legal status and function of his degraded body.29 28Wiedemann 1981, 17; Garnsey 1996, 122. Aristotle's absurd imagining of auto- kinetic tools has a long literary afterlife; in fantasy such as Lucian's Lover of Lies a world without slaves is possible. For another Lucianic view on slaveless utopia, see his Saturnalia, esp. sections 7-8. 29 Compare the symbols used in the rite of Compitalia, in which the free members of a household were represented by dolls and the unfree by woollen balls. The analysis of Sailer 1998, 88, is insightful: "The social historian's analysis of this festival must remain at the level of formal distinctions and cannot penetrate to the subjective experience of household members to discover, for example, whether the slaves felt more secure from the threaten- ing Lares by being represented, or more dehumanized on account of being represented by</page><page sequence="10">214 SONIA SABNIS Aristotle's theory of natural slavery is justly infamous for its dis- turbing appropriations by other slaveholding societies as well as for its internal weaknesses and inconsistencies. In sum, Aristotle proposes that there is a human being who is a slave by nature (Pol. 1254al4-18, 1254b21-24; trans.

He who is a human being belonging by nature not to himself but to another is by nature a slave; and a person is a human being belonging to another if being a man he is an article of property, and an article of property is an instrument for action separable from its owner. . . . For he is by nature a slave who is capable of belonging to another (and that is why he does so belong), and who participates in reason so far as to apprehend it but not to possess it; for the animals other than man are subservient not to reason, [by apprehending it,] but to feelings. Garnsey explains this passage as follows: "Natural slaves, then, are defi- cient in reason but not totally without it. Later they are said to lack the power of deliberation. That is, natural slaves cannot make decisions with respect to their own lives, but can only follow the decisions of others."30 This lack of deliberation and the inability to act properly without the decisions of a master are some of the most controversial aspects of Aristotle's theory. Yet he acknowledges that human beings with properly rational, free souls may find themselves enslaved, and much subsequent political and philosophical deliberation concerning slaves includes the category of slaves by circumstance.31 Through Lychnopolis, Lucian ques- tions the premise of natural slavery by endowing tools that are inanimate on earth not only with voices but also with reason. These are the two genderless woollen balls." For similar reasons I emphasize that the symbolism of the lamp is a motif in literature, most of which is produced by writers of the slaveholding class (in this essay, Phaedrus is an exception). The venue of fantastic literature allows these writers and their audiences to explore ideological controversies as well as to address daily struggles regarding the control of slaves. 30 Garnsey 1996, 109. 31 Seneca's exhortations to Stoicism and humane treatment of slaves, for instance, are supported by an elision of difference between master and slave - the slave may have once been free, and the master must bear his own share of servitude (Ep. 47.12, 47.17, 70, and passim).</page><page sequence="11">LUCIANI LYCHNOPOLIS 215 major components of the fearful reaction in the Lychnopolis episode. The rational capability of slaves is demonstrated in the fantasy of lamps with their own orderly city; this rationality makes their capabilities for surveillance - for seeing, hearing, and speaking the activities observed in their households - more disturbing and threatening. The ethereal Utopian worlds depicted in the novella, such as the Isle of Dreams and the Isle of the Blessed, are balanced by the uncanny, uncomfortable Lychnopolis, where humans are welcomed but superflu- ous.32 The travelers' unease stems from their estrangement from a place composed entirely of familiar objects and structures; a Utopian refuge for lamps is a dystopian ordeal for Lucian and his companions. Although the Lychnopolitans preserve their earthly physical forms, it is not clear that their status within the city corresponds to that of their owners on earth.33 Lucian observes that some lamps are small, as if poor laborers (penëtas), and that a few are bright and distinguished, as if they belong to people of high status, the great and powerful (tõn megalõn hai dunatõn).34 The 32 Utopia of this sort is common in the Greek novel: see Ruiz-Montero 2003, 38-42. See also Carsana 2008, Fauth 1979, Fusillo 1988, Nesselrath 1993 for various views of uto- pianism in the VH. Carsana's summary (2008, 178) is helpful for my purposes: "II motivo del viaggio in mondi altri rispetto a quello dell' Oikoiimene conosciuta consente a Luciano di offrire una visione, da una prospettiva alternativa e privilegiata, di quelli che sono i mali che affligono la società umana, in particular modo la sete di espansione e di dominio e l'arbitrio della giustizia, che dominano tra gli strani popoli e le creature metamorfiche che vivono nel cielo come anche in fondo al mare." 33 Cf. von Möllendorf 2000, 196: "Gewiß ebenfalls hierher gehört die in der europäis- chen Folklore geläufige Vorstellung, daß jedem Menschen ein Stern zugeordnet sei, dessen Leuchtkraft von der jeweiligen Qualität des Schicksals des Menschen abhänge (so wie es bei Lukian ,reiche' und ,arme' Lampen gibt, die - wie das Beispiel von Lukians eigener Hauslampe zeigt - offensichtlich jeweils einem Menschen gehören." 34The quantity and diversity of lamps that survive from the ancient world not only help us to visualize Lucian's Lychnopolis but also support the slave analogy, since slaves also were bought and sold on a spectrum of quality that included but was not limited to considerations of age, health, education, talent, beauty, size, strength, deformity. Slave sellers would have also marketed docility. The independent gathering of lamps in Lucian's fantasy indicates precisely the problem of assimilating slaves to instruments that could be bought and sold like other inanimate housewares.The decorations on ancient lamps (many of which survive) may speak to the analogy; for example, erotic images on ancient lamps are com- mon (Johns 1982, 143). These lamps were used in public areas of the house, for everyday uses, yet still acknowledged their intimacy with its more private activities. Lamps are also commonly found in burials, giving the deceased a token of life to assist in the journey to the next one. Cf. von Möllendorf 2000, 196-97: "Die hier zu erkennende metaphorische Ineinssetzung vom Verlöschen einer Lampe und dem Tod eines Menschen findet sich auch an anderen Stellen in der griechischen Literatur: so verwendet Lukian selbst Anach. (11,37) 35 die Lampe als Symbol für die Kürze des menschlichen Lebens."</page><page sequence="12">216 SONIA SABNIS lack of parallelism here is noteworthy: Lucian equates the small lamps with paupers, yet for the grander lamps he infers the status of their own- ers via a genitive. This difference is important for two reasons. It shows the focalization of the narrator, trying to make sense of this strange city through terms he understands from human society (the few, the great, the powerful). But it also imposes distinctions of human society that are not evident in Lychnopolis. Though visible, the differences among the lamps do not seem to affect social status in the city, for the only authority figure is the archon. The city of the lamps, unlike those of their human owners, is egalitarian. The commentators Georgiadou and Larmour compare the appella- tion Lychnopolis with Heliopolis, the supposedly Utopian community of slaves whom Aristonicus of Pergamům enlisted in his rebellion against Rome in the second century B.C.E.35 The use of -polis in the names of both communities comments on the stratified societies from which they derive; Lychnopolis, at least, maintains the structures and order of an archaic Greek polis: the city has an agora, an archon, seemingly demo- cratic representation, and, perhaps most importantly, a system of justice and punishment. It also has a harbor, a symbol of the migration of these lamps from their stations on earth to their stations in their own city. They are described as "rushing about" (peritheontas) and "hanging out" {diatribontas), activities that could describe two different types of slave characters from New Comedy.36 "Hanging out" is the requirement for the careful observation that a clever slave must perform in order to hatch his plan; though diatribein has various meanings, when used of slaves in Menander's plays this verb seems to be connected with that dramatic delay, usually on the threshold, that a curious slave deploys to observe and obtain information surreptitiously.37 Just a few sections before Lych- 35The primary sources are Strabo 14.1.38 and Diod. Sic. 34/35.2.26. See also Dawson 1992, 254, n. 32, and his bibliography, also discussed by duBois 2006, 5, and duBois 2004. Kim 1988 argues that the presence of slaves and dispossessed in Aristonicus' army should not be interpreted as egalitarian or Utopian. It is tempting to see a connection between the name heliopolitai given to Aristonicus' band of slave rebels and Lucian's society of lychno- politai, slave-objects. Although the evidence detracts from a socially radical interpretation of Aristonicus' propaganda, it is still possible that Lucian considered the similarity of the name. The observant slave-lamps are microcosmic versions of Helios, whose observation and revelation in the story of Hephaestus' cuckolding in the Odyssey (8.271) are paradigmatic. 36 As David Larmour has pointed out to me, the striking image of a lot of lamps rushing about would connote in the mind of an ancient reader a lot of slaves rushing about, since lamps were often carried by slave attendants. 37 Men.

Meanwhile, hanging out (diatribõn) on the moon I discovered strange and exotic things that I wish to share. First, they aren't born from women, but from men. In the description of the Lychnopolitans, Lucian's repetition of diatribein hints at the activity of the lamps who are loitering around the harbor - the location ensures regular traffic in information, not only exotica like Lucian's moonmen but also ordinary gossip that only animated household lamps could access and share. Thus, the infrastructure of the city reflects but also refracts that of a polis on earth, bringing the appurtenances of the innermost household into the most public spaces: the marketplace and the harbor.38 Such locales could also be hangouts for slaves and other low-status groups in terrestrial poleis, where gossip could be similarly circulated, so the lamps engaging in usual slave activities do not elicit a strong response from the travelers. It is only when Lucian realizes just how anthropomorphized the lamps are that he registers his fear, for the lamps demonstrate clearly the rational capability that Aristotle denies to natural slaves. The recognition of the rational nature of the lamps progresses through a series of increasingly anthropomorphic features: the lamps have homes and individual lampholders, emphasizing their belonging to a physical space apart from their homes on earth; they have names, like people, putting them in the class of named property, like slaves; they give forth speech, not just light, a supernatural trick that aligns them with the Roman agriculturalist Varro's definition of slaves as "tools with voices."39 Importantly, the lamps transcend even the expectations of human behavior by doing no wrong to the travelers (ouden . . . Mikoun) and even offering 38These structures are also emphasized in the Isle of Dreams, VH 2.32-33. 39 Res Rust. 17. Two of the three other instances of "giving voice" in the VH occur in episodes of great danger, where the travelers are enticed by something attractive and familiar that turns out strange and fatal: the Vine women (1 .8, the first anthropoid encounter) speak Greek (ten Hellada phõnen proiemenai), as do the Asslegs (2.46, the last episode in the novella). Both species are seductive women from the waist up, but their bottom halves betray their murderous intentions. For more on these episodes, see Larmour 1997.</page><page sequence="14">218 SONIA SABNIS them hospitality (xenia). The lamps are not only animated instruments but also moral agents. At this point Lucian interjects the reaction of the travelers to this remarkable city: they are afraid, and none dares to take a meal or to sleep in Lychnopolis.40 This statement of fear divides the description of the humane aspects of the lamps from the description of how penal justice operates in the city. The single Rhadamanthine archon perhaps parodies Aristotle's ideal monarchy (Pol. 1288a8-30).41 Lamps who do not respond when called by name are sentenced to death for the crime of leaving their station (taxis). Lucian and his companions observe tardy lamps defending themselves and stating the reasons for their delay; this detail both adds to the portrayal of the lamps as articulate and moral citizens and suggests that the lamps revere their penal system. Death by extinguishing appears comical at first, since a lamp can always be relit. Considering the lamps as servile figures, I am reminded of the dead slave joke of Philogelos (18, trans. Hansen): ахоХаслчкср tic; anavTiiaac; elnev- ó ôoûXoc;, öv ¿7Tü)'r|aác [loi, àTtéGave.- uà toùç 9eoúç, ёфг|, ттар' è(ioì оте rjv, toioOtov oùôèv enoir|aev. A man encountered a numskull and said: "The slave you sold me died." "By the gods," he said, "he didn't do anything like that when he was with me." The humor of the dead slave joke depends on the idea that a slave's death is somehow less real and less final, either because the slave is faking it (like Monty Python's dead parrot) or because one slave is as good as another and their individual lives and deaths are meaningless. An unlit lamp is as useless as a dead slave, but as long as it can be lit again, its physical form has no comic possibility. By casting the extinguishing of a lamp in fatal terms, Lucian inverts the comical way in which the death of a slave is treated in Philogelos. Lucian's executed lamps lose their life and citizenship with their light, and do not appear to have a way of coming back to life in the city. The unlit lamp provides no service, an inutility 40 Compare the opposite reaction on the Isle of Dreams (2.32-34), which forms a doublet with Lychnopolis as the Asslegs do the Vinewomen. In this episode, Lucian de- scribes the diverse society of dreams, ruled by Hypnos. Just as Lucian recognizes his lamp and finds out how things are at home, Lucian and his men recognize many of the dreams, which greet them and put them to sleep hospitably. Unlike in Lychnopolis, however, where they are offered hospitality but reject it, the travelers are charmed by the dreams and stay there for a full month enjoying their sleep. 41 Georgiadou and Larmour 1998a, 153-54, suggest instead a parody of the Nocturnal Council in Plato's Laws.</page><page sequence="15">LUCIAN'S LYCHNOPOLIS 219 that reminds us that however much slaves are treated as mere bodies, however much their rational ability (symbolized by light) is repressed, their usefulness ultimately depends on it. After observing the activities of Lychnopolis, Lucian recognizes his own lamp and speaks to it, inquiring after the welfare of the household he has left. The fact that Lucian finds out from his own lamp everything going on at home (hapanta ekeina) but does not go into specifics shows how comprehensive the knowledge of slaves could be. The speed with which the travelers depart and the narrator moves to the next adventure may simply indicate a reluctance to burden the reader with the details of what he found out, but it also reflects the fear of the narrator and his companions. The notion that the events at home could be brought into contact with the extraterrestrial is deeply troubling to the head of the household as well as to the narrator whose preoccupations are everything but ordinary life. On earth, the lamps are the spectators, shut up in the most intimate recesses of the house. In the society of Lychnopolis, these normally silent observers become citizens, entering a space marked as public and elite, congregating and speaking, thus empowering themselves and possibly betraying the secrets of their households. The fear engendered by Lychnopolis further reflects the constant surveillance that character- ized the gaze of the slave upon the master. Throughout classical literature lamps are symbols of domestic slaves who silently observe the private lives of their masters. Although lamps find voice only in the fictions of Lucian and the fantasies of love epigram, slaves (usually) did have voices. Lych- nopolis represents the very real possibility that slaves would congregate and spill their household secrets, not just privately for entertainment and mild resistance, but also in the courts or other socially injurious venues. Slaves could be tortured to give special evidence, testimony that no one else could access, against their masters.42 The fantasy whereby lamps come to life and acquire voices approaches, however obliquely, the difficulty in denying voices to slaves as a method of control. ARISTOPHANES TO WODEHOUSE The prolific and varied humor of Lucian's satire is difficult to match, but a twentieth-century master, P. G. Wodehouse, offers a remarkable parallel for my analysis of Lychnopolis. The Junior Ganymede Club is a peculiar 42 See Wiedemann 1981, 167-71, for primary sources for slave testimony under torture as well as the overview of Bradley 1994, 164-71, and, for a perspective on classical Athens, duBois 1991,35-38,47-68.</page><page sequence="16">220 SONIA SABNIS reflection of Bertie Wooster's Drones Club; both institutions foster leisure and conviviality among a select group of gentlemen, but membership in the Junior Ganymede Club, as the name suggests, is especially exclusive.43 Like Jeeves, the members of the club are "Gentlemen's Gentlemen," and the key requirement of their membership is the contribution of enter- taining stories about the misadventures and hapless behavior of their employers. These stories are recorded in a single volume. When Bertie Wooster finds out about this book, his curiosity about its potential utility is nearly outweighed by his personal anxiety. As the fullest description of the Junior Ganymede Club also reveals Bertie's own trouble with animated lamps, I quote it at length: "I was thinking of the Junior Ganymede, sir. It is a club for gentle- men's personal gentlemen in Curzon Street, to which I have belonged for some years. The personal attendant of a gentleman of Mr Spode's prominence would be sure to be a member, and he would, of course, have confided to the secretary a good deal of material concerning him, for inser- tion in the club book." "Eh?" "Under Rule Eleven, every new member is required to supply the club with full information regarding his employer. This not only provides entertaining reading, but serves as a warning to members who may be contemplating taking service with gentlemen who fall short of the ideal." A thought struck me, and I started. Indeed, I started rather violently. "What happened when you joined?" "Sir?" "Did you tell them about me?" "Oh, yes, sir." "What, everything? The time when old Stoker was after me and I had to black up with boot polish in order to assume a rudimentary disguise?" "Yes, sir." "And the occasion on which I came home after Pongo Twistleton's birthday party and mistook the standard lamp for a burglar?" "Yes, sir. The members like to have these things to read on wet afternoons."44 This alarming idea, that servants congregate and spill all their masters' secrets to each other, is precisely the one that I see lurking behind the Lychnopolis episode. Like Bertie Wooster, masters who rely on domes- 43 It is fitting that the ironic praenomen Junior resonates with the Greek commonplace pai discussed at the beginning of this essay. "Wodehouse 2005, 123-24.</page><page sequence="17">LUCIAN'S LYCHNOPOLIS 221 tic servants inevitably sacrifice some privacy and dignity. Unlike Bertie Wooster, however, masters in antiquity controlled their slaves through brutality, violence, degradation, and fear. Masters regularly repressed the voices and deliberative capacities of their slaves, and for slaves these faculties became sources of resistance.45 This threat to social hierarchies, comic in its application to Bertie Wooster's society, appears in various forms throughout classical literature: in connection with lamps, I will look at Aristophanes, Hellenistic and imperial epigram, another satire of Lucian, and a short verse-fable of Babrius. Like valets, lamps can move easily from a private environment to a public one, and their function as witnesses draws attention to the difficulty of maintaining the boundary between public and private. The transgres- sion of this boundary underlies the opening speech of Aristophanes' Assemblywomen, which shows clearly the kinship between lamp and slave. Praxagora begins the play with praise for her lamp (Eccl. 1-16): (Ь XajiKpòv ö(ijia той трох^Хатои Xúxvou, KáXXicrr' év eÙGTÓ^oiaiv èÇr|i)pr||iévov - yováç те yap crac; кш xú^ac; ôriXcóaouev- трохФ yap éXaGeiç кера|лкг|с pújarjc; ало (iUKTřjpai Хацлрас rjXíou Tiuàç ëxeiç - орца (pXoyòç aquela та ÇuyKeíueva. crol yàp (ióvcp 6r|Xoü(i8v eÌKÓTCoc, еле! kčxv Toïai ôtofiaTÍoiatv AcppooÍTqc; Tpčmojv neipü)(iévaiai 7tXr|aíov лараататеТс, Xopôoi)(iévcov te acouawv елкггатг^ òcpBaXuòv oùôeiç tòv aòv èÇeípyei ôóucov. lióvoç ôè |iT]pü)v eie; алоррг)тоис; (iuxoùc; Xá(iK8ic; à(pE')o)v Tf]v ¿HavBouaav Tpíxa- GToác; те карлоо BaKxíou те уацатос; лХг|рек; í)лolYvúaalGt аицлараататеТс;- ка1 таита auvôpcõv ov XaXeic; toïç лХг|аюи 45 An idea best exemplified by a passage from Seneca's famous letter on slaves (Ep. 47.3-4): "As for the unfortunate slaves, they cannot even move their lips to speak; every murmur is held in by the rod, and not even the slightest accidental cough, sneeze, or hiccough is spared from whippings; if the silence is broken by any noise there is great evil to pay; they stand starving and silent for the whole night. Thus it comes about that slaves who are not allowed to speak to the master speak about him" (at infelicibus semis mouere labra ne in hoc quidem ut loquantur, licet; uirga murmur omne compescitur, et ne fortuita quidem uerberibus excepta sunt, tussis, sternumenta, singultus; magno malo ulla uoce interpellatum silentium luitur; nocte tota ieiuni mutique persiani.

To you alone I'll reveal our secret - and rightly so, since you too stand by us in our bedrooms as we try out sexual variations, and no one shuts out your eye from the chamber, though it looks over our bending bodies. You alone shine into the illicit recesses of our thighs, singeing away the hair that grows there; you stand with us as we open up the stores full of the grain and the streams of Bacchus. And a true accomplice in these deeds, you don't blab to the neighbors. The conceit of the Assemblywomen is the invasion of political space by a marginalized group: Praxagora's women leave their homes and disguise themselves as men in order to participate in the Assembly. On account of the lamp's association with women's clandestine activities, Praxagora's eulogy on the threshold fashions the plot in miniature, marking the passage of private to public. Furthermore, her biography of the lamp combines the banausic origins of the lamp with the glory of the sun, celestial source of all light. The contradiction of something exalted in a humble container aligns well with a paradox of slavery: while ideological discussions of slavery stress the instrumentality of slave bodies, practical advice acknowledges not only the voice but even the rational capabilities of slaves. Praxagora's open declaration of the extraordinarily intimate rela- tionship between her lamp and herself transforms her audience into voyeurs: merely by bringing the lamp out of the house, Praxagora gives to the audience, by hearsay, a scintilla of what the lamp sees of her surrepti- tious bedroom activities.46 The fantasy of the audience is contrasted with Praxagora's own, which emerges from the culmination of her praise: the lamp is her aide and accomplice, but it does not blab to others. This ironic remark cuts short the assimilation of lamp and slave; Praxagora is able to confide in her lamp fully without fear that the lamp will communicate her secrets to the neighbors. Although she has both theomorphized and anthropomorphized her lamp, hailing it as a god and endowing it with 46 For the lamp in singeing pubes, see also Thesm. 236^6 and Lys. 825-28. For bed- room activities of a non-cosmetic nature, compare the epigrams infra.</page><page sequence="19">LUCIAN'S LYCHNOPOLIS 223 not only a biography but also animate senses and nostrils in place of its spout, her confidence in the lamp's silence firmly sets it back into the category of inanimate tools. Praxagora's assuredness reveals the problem in the slave-lamp assimilation, and indeed of any assimilation of slaves and speechless entities; slaves have voices and therefore their silence is not as incorruptible as that of the lamp.47 The way in which Praxagora is using the lamp at the beginning of the Assemblywomen is also significant. She acknowledges that the usual station of the lamp is in the bedroom, where it witnesses and abets some the most intimate aspects of women's lives. Furtively exiting her own house in anticipation of entering the Assembly, Praxagora removes the lamp from its interior domestic space and uses it to signal to her accom- plices. As the chorus of women approaches, she says, uOh, I see a lamp coming" (air horõ tondi lychnon prosionta, 27-28). The lamp is both an accomplice and a surrogate; the migration of the lamps from the private home to the public street reflects the premise of the play.48 The premises of Lychnopolis and the Assemblywomen are similar - each portrays a dis- enfranchised group making a claim to political authority - but the humor of Aristophanes' version is expressed more subtly in Lucian's.The example of Aristophanes demonstrates the importance of generic expectations: his comedy inverts social reality, and Lucian's Lychnopolis is one in a long series of fantastic scenarios. Yet the venue of fiction, which at least for Lucian intertwines questions of entertainment and humor with those of truth, proves to offer less comfort and catharsis than comedy when it comes to the airing of social tensions.49 We must further consider a third genre that liberally employs the trope of the animate lamp in order to evaluate the pressures of Lucian's social satire in Lychnopolis. The animate lamp, as speaker, addressee, or bystander, populates epigram in both Greek and Latin. While such epigrams undoubtedly 47 A notable exception is the slave Aesop, who according to tradition was mute until Isis bestowed her favor upon him. On Aesop's voice, see Finkelpearl 2003, Kurke 2006. 48While Praxagora imagines her lamp as an ideal slave, it is notable that the utopia of the Assemblywomen does not do away with slavery (Eccl. 651). Lucian's Lychnopolis maintains status distinctions but there is no mention of slavery; not just slaves but humans are entirely absent. For slaves in utopia, see Bertelli 1985. von Möllendorf 2000, 199-200, also suggests a passage from Aristophanes' Birds for comparison (1482-1489), in which the chorus sings of a place that is devoid of lamps (though the exact meaning of en tèi luchnõn erëmiai is debatable) and heroes and men dine and converse together: the absence of slave-like figures underscores the egalitarian nature of the colloquy. 49 Lucian's seriocomic style is unique, a self-conscious combination of Aristophanic, Platonic, Menippean, and other philosophical elements reassessed for a second-century sophistic audience. For a helpful overview, see Branham 1989, 26-28.</page><page sequence="20">224 SONIA SABNIS influenced Lucian's Lychnopolis, the assimilation of lamp and slave in this genre operates with some difference: the displacement of anxiety from a slave to a lamp contains and defuses any potential for social subversion. Epigrammatic lovers idealize their lamps as perfect slaves, personifying them and imbuing them with magic. Thus, their duties as intermediaries and witnesses to intimate love affairs can be acclaimed without the scruples that control master-slave relations. This difference is particularly plain in an epigram of Philodemus (7 Sider = 1 GP = Anth. Pal. 5.4; trans.

Philainis, soak with oily dew the lamp, the silent confidant of acts which are not to be spoken of, and then leave. For Love alone does not desire living witness. And shut the door tight, Philainis. And you, dear Xantho, (to) me - but now, О lover-loving wife, learn what Aphrodite has left for us.50 Philodemus' epigram emphasizes the lamp's mute witness and suggests a contrast between the lamp and the maid who tends it. The lamp stays while the maid has to get out, ostensibly because she herself cannot be trusted to keep silent in the same way. Philainis is an animate witness; the possibility that the lamp could be just as threatening is both fostered and controlled through the instruction to her. The silence of the lamp, affirmed in the first line, is reaffirmed by this command: like a reliable alcoholic, the lamp must be supplied with its customary drink in order to grant long and unfailing light to the lovers while clouding its own vision.51 Lucian's 5()Sider's text differs slightly from that of Gow and Page; the major crux is whether the final address is to the wife (akoitis) or the bed (koitë). I find Sider's arguments for the former convincing, though the address to the bed would affine this poem to Lucian's Downward Journey. See Sider 1987, 311-13; Sider 1997, 89-90. 51 As Sider 1997, 87, notes, there are many instances of jokes involving personified drunken or thirsty lamps (e.g., Ar. Nub. 57). The positive aspect of lamp inebriation is the duration of its light. Sider emphasizes the metaphorical aspects of the oil, suggesting that the intoxication would cloud the vision and usual witnessing function of the epigrammatic lamp. There is also a sense that the drunkenness of the lamp intensifies its essential inca- pacity to speak, which contrasts strikingly with the effect that oil-intoxication has on the</page><page sequence="21">LUCIAN'S LYCHNOPOLIS 225 lamps are by contrast fully animated, so that the fantasy of Lychnopolis engenders (against the speaker of this poem as well as Aristophanes' Praxagora) the possibility that even lamps cannot be trusted, that the lamp is more similar to Philainis than Philodemus allows. The assuredness of the lamp's silence is in fact undercut by another Anthology epigram (Flaccus 1 GP = Anth. Pal 5.5): àpyúpeov vuxícov ue auvíatopa matòv èpcímov où Kiaxfj Xi&gt;xvov ФХаккос ёбюке Nánr|, fjç Trapa vûv 'e'èeooi uapaívou' ó xřjc; еяюркои navTonaQi) Koúpnç a'íaxea oepKÓ|i£voc, ФХакке, aè ô' àypvnvov yakenai Teipouai [iépi(ivai- ацфа) ô' àXXr|Xo)v avôixa каюцеба. Flaccus gave to faithless Nape me, a silver lamp, faithful confidant to nighttime affairs; Now at her bedside I wither away, seeing the shameless debauchery of the treacherous girl; Flaccus, bitter cares gnaw away your sleep, both of us burn, though far away from one another. In contrast to the drunk and mute lamp of Philodemus, the lamp of Flac- cus speaks about what it sees. The lamp's authority as the speaker of the poem is exaggerated by the high value of its material, but by contrast its worthlessness as a token of a faithful love is symbolized by its impotent withering away at Nape's bedside. The high quality of the lamp fails to make Nape faithful to Flaccus, who, likewise impotent and sleepless, hears the lamp's address at a distance. For Flaccus, the lamp serves as a surrogate, not only by providing surveillance of Nape's affairs, but also by burning as an instantiation of the lover's torment in his own bed. Flaccus' lamp speaks to him and to the audience as a trusted accomplice, his fidelity derived from the fact that it is Flaccus' own gift; the successful lover of Philodemus' epigram, by contrast, relies on the lamp's complicit silence. lamp of Babrius. On my analogy, these jokes belie the risk posed by inebriated slaves that the Roman tradition of Saturnalia released (cf. Lucían Sat. 15: "Let each slave drink one cup and then run off, demanding nothing more"). The opposite effects of incapacitation and garrulity parallel the literature on slaves and wine: for example, the slave Sosias at the beginning of Aristophanes' Wasps is sleeping off a drinking bout, dreaming about the ship of state rather than assiduously guarding Procleon (1-74). Slaves celebrate Saturnalia by banqueting, drinking, and talking freely to their masters: e.g., Lucian Sat. 5: "If this were not a holiday and you were not permitted to get drunk and abuse your masters . . ." (ei më heortën . . . ëgomen kai methuein epheito kai loidoreisthai tois despotais ep' exousias).</page><page sequence="22">226 SONIA SABNIS When considered as figures for slaves, the lamps of these two poems demonstrate the complexity of slave knowledge and information. When their knowledge is useful to the master, slaves are expected to inform, but otherwise they must keep silent about what they witness. The lamp's role as accomplice and its miniature representation of the sun's all-seeing light combine to make the lamp a token of oaths for epigrammatic lovers. An epigram of Asclepiades expresses the power of the bedroom lamp in ambivalent and ambiguous terms (9 HE - Anth. Pal 5.7): 'i&gt;XV£, ok yap napeovoa Tplç touocev'HpctKXeia fí^Eiv Koi&gt;x nK£l* Mxve&gt; au ô', ei беек; eï, tí]v ôoXírjv àTCá|ii)vov- ÖTav cpíXov ëvôov exouaa лш(п&gt; шюареоЭек; ипкетч cpiõç парг'г. Lamp, three times Heracleia right here swore by you to come, and she comes not. Lamp, if you are a god, Take vengeance on the deceitful girl. When she has a boyfriend over to play with, put yourself out and give them no more light. The lamp's supposed divinity contributes to the speaker's fantasy of the lamp's powers. As Gutzwiller notes, "the lover's extravagant address to the lamp signals his irrational willingness to believe that any ordinary lamp, as typical witness of love-making, has the godlike power to be manifest in many places."52 Considering this irrationality in light of Lychnopolis, I suspect the travelers' fear of the city is connected to the wistful pathos of the sentiment expressed here; the novella realizes and makes rational the irrationality of the lover's complaint: Lucian's lamps are indeed endowed with power to be manifested in many places. To counter the irrational divine power and autonomy of the lamp, the latter half of the epigram emphasizes its subservience to the lover; this tension belies the servility of the lamp, which is expected to sacrifice its light, the one thing that supports its claim to divinity, for the gratifica- tion of the jilted lover. As Gow and Page and the LSJ note, the order to avenge the insult is a unique use of the verb apamunein, which usually 52 Gutzwiller 2007, 319, and her notes. See also Tueller 2008, 120-21, who discusses this and the next lamp poem of Asclepiades {Anth. Pal 5.150) in the context of the conventions of oaths in epigram; the lamp takes the role of a god, a substitution that not only indicates the helplessness of the lover (Gutzwiller 1998, 139), but also manipulates the convention of epigram. A consideration of slaves in these erotic epigrams is useful to understanding the tension between public and private; the illusion of privacy is already disrupted by slaves, whose sensibilities are willfully passed over in favor of inanimate witnesses.</page><page sequence="23">LUCIAN'S LYCHNOPOLIS 227 means "ward off." A verb of defense both intensifies the surrogacy of the lamp - the lover implies an exhortation to himself to keep his distance from this treacherous beloved - and sustains its agency. The speaker transfers his indignation and sexual frustration to the lamp, which can punish Heracleia on the moral grounds of her perjury. Still, the impos- sibility of the lover's command is understood; the lamp is able neither to extinguish its own flame permanently nor, even if it were, to guaran- tee that such an act would inexorably disrupt the beloved and her new partner.53 Asclepiades similarly directs sexual frustration at the lamp in another epigram (10 HE = Anth. Pal 5.150): сЬцоХоутр' qÇeiv eu; vúkto. uoi r' 'лфогггос Niku) кш G£(ivf]v coroas 0£auo(pópov- коих ПК61- сриХакг] ôè ларскхетш. áp' ¿KiopKelv rjöeXe; xòv Xúxvov, Ttaîôeç, шюареаате. The celebrated Nico promised to come to me at nightfall, and she swore by solemn Demeter. She has not come, and the night-watch is gone. Did she mean then to forswear herself? Boys, put out the light. This epigram of Asclepiades brings us back to the juxtaposition given prominence by Athenaeus - the lamp is conjoined with slaves. Here, the lamp is not the stated witness to the forsworn oath; a goddess assumes that role. Still, the lamp's presence is meaningful: frustration at the false oath cannot be safely directed at Demeter, even in her most awesome incarnation as the Law-Giver (Thesmophoros), but is instead directed at the lamp.54 The extinguishing of the lamp could also suggest the loss of sexual potency; Gow and Page state that the conjunction with the Heracleia poem gives the meaning "that all hope of pleasure must now be abandoned."55 Rebuffed by a sacrilegious courtesan, the speaker of this poem has lost the opportunity for the eros that defines this type of 53 Like the Lychnopolitan archon, this epigram nurses the fantasy that an extinguished lamp cannot be relit. 54Tueller 2008, 121 : "In practical terms, the speaker no longer needs the light, because he has given up waiting. But the command causes the reader to think that the lamp may somehow be linked to the oath." ^HE v. 2, 124. Perhaps, though, we should revive the interpretation of Wilamowitz- Moellendorff 1962, 113, that Gow and Page reject: "Niko kam nicht. Man erwartet, er wird sehnsüchtig oder ärgerlich sein; bewahre, sie kommt nicht, gut, dann schlafen wir eben. Gegenüber seinem Mädchen hat er und haben sie alle keine seelischen Gefühle; danach sind diese Damen nicht, Niko soll sich nicht einbilden, daß er nicht ohne sie leben könnte."</page><page sequence="24">228 SONIA SABNIS epigram; the slaves he invokes also lose their chance to play witnesses to this love affair. While the light of the lamp is closely conjoined with heterosexual eros, the darkness may conceal the fact that the speaker is now left alone with his slaves - perhaps he directs his frustrated desire to a more available target.56 The association of lamp and slave allows writers of erotic epigram to suppress the baser acts that happen between master and slave. By focusing on the lamp's witness rather than the watchful presence of slaves, these poets defuse the anxieties arising from the ubiquity of slaves as witnesses, accomplices, and sexual targets. Moreover, the loss of lamplight not only signifies the failure of a liaison with a desirable woman but also perhaps conceals a less decorous act. Slaves' inextricable association with baser sexual practices implicitly ruins them; whereas the lamp provides pure and faithful witness to a love affair, a slave (like Philainis) would be a voyeur. Epigrams of the Hellenistic and imperial periods depict a variety of situations in which a lamp takes on the persona of a slave and wit- nesses the success and failure of love affairs.57 1 have argued that even in the unreal situations in which a lamp speaks, the prominence of the lamp helps to distract from the inevitable presence of slaves in intimate settings. The material bodies of the lamps are exalted by the light they carry, but they cannot be fully assimilated to those of slaves. The slippage is particularly keen and important in the sexual manipulation of slaves; sex between a master and slave is unmentionable in most of Greek literature, but the lamp analogy allows a faint pressure of this practice to show. In Lucian's Downward Journey, we see the lamp taking on its slave persona more fully, yet maintaining the moral authority that the Lychnopolitans seem to have. The Downward Journey dramatizes the underworld trial of the tyrant Megapenthes. As in any trial, witnesses from his household are needed, but instead of bringing out slaves to testify under torture, the prosecutors produce the bed and the lamp. Their testimony seals the case of the prosecution, and their appearance recalls an earlier scene in the 56 On sexual abuse of slaves, see Bradley 1987, 118. 57 Others that are relevant include Asclepiades 16 HE = Anth.

After my slave Cario saw that I was dead, towards dusk he came to the room where I lay, just as he pleased - for no one was guarding me - and brought in my mistress Glycerion - I guess they had been on intimate terms for a while. He closed the door and was banging her as if no one else were in the room. Then when he had had enough, he turned his eye to me and said, "You repulsive little man, you gave me beatings many times when I had done nothing wrong." And once he said that he yanked out my hair and beat me around the temples, and finally he hawked up a load, spat on me, and said, "Go to hell." Unanimated, Megapenthes effectively switches roles with his slave Cario. The tyrant is reduced to his corporeal remains, soundly abused both verbally and physically by the slave and unable to respond. Moreover, the dead master now becomes witness to the sexual activity of the slave, and only when dead sees clearly what had been going on even prior to his demise. Megapenthes' complaints are interrupted by a summons to his own trial under the jurisdiction of Rhadamanthus. There the prosecutor Cyniscus charges him with the murders of thousands for material gain and a host of vices. In such a setting, the tyrant cannot but admit the murders, for the souls of the dead men are flocking around him; however, he pointedly denies that he corrupted boys and girls.58 Cyniscus quickly replies that he has witnesses: the lamp and the bed, essential and intimate accomplices in these crimes (Catapl. 27-28): (Kyniikoz) npoGKáXei (ioi, to 'Epfifj, tòv Xúxvov аитоо Kai Trjv KXivrjv- fiapTupr|aouai yàp aÙToì napeXGóvTec;, oía KpárrovTi auvrjKÍcrravTo аитф. 58 Catapl. 27: tas moicheias kai tas ton ephebon hubreis kai tas diaphthoras ton parthenõn, tauta panta Kuniskos mou katepseusato.</page><page sequence="26">230 SONIA SABNIS (Epmhi) r) KXivn Kai ó Aùxvoç ó MeyaKévooix; яареато). eu ye ércoínaav ÚKaKoúaavTEc;.

Cyniscus: Hermes, call to the stand his lamp and his bed. They were pres- ent and they will testify as to what they know he did. Hermes: I call to the stand Bed and Lamp of Megapenthes. Good, they have answered the summons. Rhadamanthus: Tell the court what you know about this Megapenthes. Bed, you speak first. Bed: Everything Cyniscus says is true. I am ashamed to say such things, your honor. So shameful were the acts that he perpetrated on me. Rhadamanthus: By not being able to tell us you've told us plenty already. And now, Lamp, you take the stand. Lamp: I don't know what he got up to by day, because I wasn't there. But what he did during the night, I hesitate to say, though I saw many things, all unmentionable and transgressing all propriety. Very often I willingly abstained from the oil, wishing to go out. But he made me an accomplice to his deeds and polluted my light in every respect. Both the bed and the lamp are hesitant in their testimony, perhaps in imitation of slaves on the stand; the lamp even confesses to suicidal thoughts, but ultimately provides more extensive testimony than the bed, confirming the ambiguity of the lamp as a tool: the bed is merely used, but the lamp is more active.59 The abstention from oil recalls the epigram of Asclepiades on Heracleia's perjury, supporting the equation between 59On the bed as witness, cf. the last line of Asclepiades 25 HE = Anth. Pal. 5.181: klinë martus epegrapheto.</page><page sequence="27">LUCIANI LYCHNOPOLIS 231 the fatal extinguishing of a lamp and the attempted disruption of a sexual liaison. Like the unnamed slaves in Asclepiades' Nico poem, the lamp of Megapenthes takes on a curious surrogacy, speaking as though a victim of the tyrant's sexual debaucheries instead of as a representative of the tyrant himself. The lamp's testimony is further significant along the lines I have been pursuing, for it shows not only the lamp's status as specta- tor (using the verb etheasamën) but also the problem of actually telling what it saw: the acts of the tyrant are unspeakable (compare the term arrhëta with alaletõn in Philodemus' Philainis epigram), denoting both the depraved nature of the acts and the normal muteness of the lamp. Only in this underworld court does the lamp get to voice its resistance in a way that defines it apart from the ethics and activities of the master. After death, the anxieties of the tyrannical master are realized: the slave Cario whose resistance had been secret now flaunts his hatred of his master, citing his unjust practices, and his inanimate household furniture confirms his vicious private activity. The animation of inanimate household objects is enabled by dis- placement to another fantastic world, this time the mythical underworld where the virtuous are rewarded and the vicious are punished. This scene illuminates the profound irony that slaves' voices were valued only in court under torture.60 To expose the arrogance of this claim, insofar as it was part of the ideology of Greek and Roman slaveholders, Lucian imagines that the tools themselves have voices. Inanimate on earth, they serve only their master's activity, a use that in Lucian's fantastic version makes them the ideal receptacles of unblemished truth.61 While the witnessing function of household lamps is critical in the works discussed so far, it is also important that the personification of the lamps goes beyond merely endowing them with human senses; these lamps are given rudimentary personalities. Common perceptions of slave personalities congruent with certain slave characters of New Comedy emerge: these lamps are timid, melodramatic, idealized as loyal, yet prone to fretful inaction. That some lamps are materially simple and others elaborate is also important, to differentiate the physical endow- ments and functions of slaves, to distinguish the ranks of their masters, 60 See above, nn. 6 and 42. 61 Cf. duBois 1991, 68: "Truth is constituted as residing in the body of the slave; be- cause he can apprehend reason, without possessing reason, under coercion he is assumed to speak the truth." The bed and lamp of Megapenthes not only mock Aristotle's definition of a slave, by possession of speech and reason despite their function as inanimate tools, but also show moral principles superior to the debauchery of their human master.</page><page sequence="28">232 SONIA SABNIS or to attach a token of material value to the love affair. Idealized as the slaves who are the moral agents and active extensions of their masters, the lamps in the above examples do not seriously challenge the institution of slavery. Consider the humorous revenge of Cario: though the slave's licentiousness is new, Cario's vices seem similar to those of his master (indeed, they love the same woman). The slave does not challenge the fact of slavery, merely the injustice that Megapenthes flogged him even when he had done nothing wrong. Although the lamp, as an inanimate household object in the real world, is unable to transcend its form and function, its underworld testimony as a slave challenges the assumption of slaves' moral inferiority. The compunction of Megapenthes' lamp is comical but also empowering - this is the testimony that seals the guilt of the tyrant. (The final reversal is the revelation of the tyrant's body: covered in weals and bruises that mark each of his sins, Megapenthes is the ultimate stigmatias, a word that usually applies to runaway slaves who were branded.) Like the Lychnopolitans, Megapenthes' lamp comes to life in another world not just through speech but also through moral actions, separate and distinct from those of the master. One final source that bears on the lamps of Lychnopolis is a fable of Babrius. Here the moral failing of the lamp reflects a more universal problem, but unlike most animal fables, which regularly imagine the conversation of animals apart from humans, this fable draws attention to the strangeness of impossible speech by putting the lamp in dialogue with a man (Babrius 2.114; trans. Perry): [leGúíüv èXaícp Xú^voç есшерпс; nüxei ярое; toùç TtapóvTcu;, (bç 'Ewacpópou Kpeíaacov, аяасп среууос; ектгрелеататсп/ Хацтш. àvé|ioi) Ôè aupíaavToç eùGùç eaßea6r| TTvoifj pamaGeíç. ек Ôè оеитерпс; шпхоу efrtév tic; сштф "cpaîve, Xityve, ка! aíya- Ttõv àcrrépwv то среууос; oùk à7To9vf|aK£i." A lamp intoxicated with oil at evening boasted to those around that it excelled the morning star and far outshone in splendor all the lights of the heavens. Just then the wind began to whistle, and by its blast the lamp's light was put out all at once. A man rekindled it and said: "Shine, lamp, and be silent. The light of the stars never goes out." The fable admonishes those of humble status to keep their places, which is precisely what Lucian's lamps do not do. In Lychnopolis, humble ter- restrial lamps are transformed into celestial lights - not the brightest</page><page sequence="29">LUCIANAS LYCHNOPOLIS 233 stars, but still in the heavens. Whereas for Babrius' lamp speech is a risky business, Lychnopolis provides the lamps a venue in which they are not only able but also expected to give voice. Like Flaccus' lamp in the poem quoted above, the lamp in Babrius' fable speaks, but the speech is a paradoxical reminder of its limitations; only by speaking and trans- gressing these limits does it fully realize its proper position. The lamp is doubly offensive, both by insulting the celestial lights and by speaking at all. If the assimilation between lamp and slave adheres in the fables - in this genre it is easy to identify oblique ways of talking about slavery and resistance - this particular poem may illustrate the dangers bound up with a slave exercising his voice. The previous examples from other sources imagine lamps - by extension, slaves - as empowered in some distinct way, but reconfirm the status ideology by focalization through the master. What is striking about Lychnopolis is that the encounter between Lucian and his lamp reverses the normal power dynamic: the lamp is the one endowed not only with speech but also with knowledge, and the swift departure allows the discomfort of this reversal to linger. The personification of lamps in other scenarios offers contrasting elements to show additional reasons why Lucian's reaction to the imaginary city of Lychnopolis is one of fear. Whereas Praxagora and Philodemus count on the silence of their lamps, Lucian's lamps not only speak but speak with omniscience and clarity. Lychnopolis allows a full display of autonomy and reason on the part of lamps and thus of slaves; they are not just base reflections or extensions of their masters.62 Theories regarding science fiction have been useful in approaches to the True Histories?7* In this genre, dislocation to a fantastic world disrupts readers' convictions about their own world, heightening their awareness of stereotypes and problems in their society. The alternate worlds in sci- ence fiction regularly offer oblique criticisms of the world we know. In 62The comments of duBois 1991, 61, on the different compulsions to truth in testi- mony seem germane to the difference in the conduct of the lover and the witnessing lamps: "[T]he free man is compelled by oaths; he might lose his rights as a citizen if he lied under oath. The slave, even though he will certainly be put to death as a consequence of what he reveals under torture, will nonetheless, under torture, reveal the truth." 63 So Fredericks 1976, who does not discuss the Lychnopolis episode, but his conclu- sion (56) that the value of Lucian's fictional Isle of the Blessed "lies in its being a model by means of which human ambitions and yearnings for a more perfect existence can be judged in light of the norms of everyday, imperfect society" is relevant. See also Georgiadou and Larmour 1998a, 44-48.</page><page sequence="30">234 SONIA SABNIS my interpretation of Lychnopolis, the fantastic idea of lamps speaking and assembling exposes several very real problems in the controlling of slaves. Social control through silencing was never fully effective; slaves may have been treated like animals but they were endowed with voices and reason, and the masters knew it. The stunning clarity of their speech and their civic participation - answering a call to attendance in Lychnopolis, offering truthful testimony in the Downward Journey - challenge both Aristotle's definition of slaves and the dehumanizing practices of slaveholders of the Roman Empire. Lucian's journey can continue, thanks to the full report of his lamp, but it is also his prolonged absence from home that gives his lamp the freedom to exert his Lychnopolitan citizenship. I will conclude with two brief corollaries to my argument. First, the ancient practice of lychnomancy (predicting the future by gazing at the light of a lamp) can also serve the slave analogy. Second, the moral reasoning that Lucian's lamps demonstrate to their masters has impor- tant repercussions in the story of Lucian's reception; works of the Italian Renaissance may perpetuate the repressive ideologies about slaves and domestic servants, both by invoking the lamp as a substitute and by chan- neling master-slave conflict into other areas of social tension. LYCHNOMANCY An epigram of Argentarius addresses a lamp as the source of a good omen (14 GP = Anth.

My dearest lamp, you have sneezed three times; do you predict that darling Antigone will perhaps come to my bedroom? О my lord, I would that this were true: another Apollo you could be, a prophet for mortals beside the tripod. The sanctity of the lamp ties this poem to those that call upon the lamp as sacred witness, but its mantic function here adds a new dimension to the intimacy of lamps and lovers in the epigrams we saw earlier. Despite the exaltation of the lamp in this poem, the tradition of associa- tion between lamp and slave suggests an ironic reading of the honorific anax, an inappropriate social inversion that speaks to the desperation of</page><page sequence="31">LUCIAN'S LYCHNOPOLIS 235 the lover.64 (We should also remember that the promising sputter of the lamp was assured in other contexts by a sprinkling of wine.65) The lover, with the appearance of optimism, safely acclaims his lamp; his esteem perhaps hubristically reaches the point of a divine comparison. The dan- ger of overvaluing the lamp while undervaluing the slave is apparent in Apuleius' Metamorphoses, a work of roughly the same period as the True Histories.^ Pamphile, the witch whose magic ointment proves fateful for the hero Lucius, performs lychnomancy when she predicts the weather by looking into her lamp, much to the naïve perplexity of her husband Milo (Apul. Met. 2.11): sed adsidue respiciens praeministrantem Photidem inibi recreabar animi, cum ecce iam uesperam lucernám intuens Pamphile: "quam largus" inquit "imber aderit crastino" et percontanti marito qui comperisset istud respondit sibi lucernám praedicere. Quod dictum ipsius Milo risu secutus: "grandem" inquit "istam lucernám Sibyllam pascimus, quae cuneta caeli negotia et solem ipsum de specula candelabri contuetur." But I was reviving myself by watching Photis going about her work when Pamphile, gazing into her lamp (for it was now evening) pronounced, "How large a rain storm there will be tomorrow." When her husband asked how she had learned that, she replied that the lamp had prophesied to her. Whereupon Milo rejoined with a laugh, "We are tending a magnificent Sibyl in that lamp, who watches all the business of heaven and the sun itself from her lamp-stand observatory." Lucius responds to Milo's incredulity with a tale of his own experience with divination, which Milo also ridicules. This conversation is impor- tant for many reasons, but I emphasize here the neat parallel between Pamphile's slave, Photis, with whom Lucius enjoys a torrid affair and who is a key agent in his own transformation, and Pamphile's lamp. The lamp, shrouded in magic, subsumes Photis' role to the advantage of the mistress. Lucius watches Photis the slave; Pamphile watches her lamp. 64 In Anthology epigrams, the word anax is usually reserved for divinity and Caesars, but for a slave master, see Anth. Pal. 7.632 (Diodorus 7 GP), a lament for a slave child who fell down the stairs and reached for his master (anakta). 65 Ov. Her. 19.151-54: sternuti et lumen, (pósito пат scribimus ilio) /sternuti et nobis prospera signa dedit / ecce, merum nutrix faustos instillât in ignes, / 'eras' que 'erimus plures' inquit et ipsa bibit' Prop. 4.3.60: uoluit tangi parca lucerna mero. 66 Apuleius has much more to contribute to the study of lamps in ancient literature; Pamphile's lamp is only one of many in the Metamorphoses. I am preparing a companion- piece to this article with a focus on the Latin tradition; it will appear in Arethusa.</page><page sequence="32">236 SONIA SABNIS Unlike Photis, Pamphile's lamp serves only Pamphile; it speaks to her alone and silently participates in her rituals of transformation (respondit sibi lucernám praedicere, Met. 2.11; multumque cum lucerna secreto col- locuta, Met. 3.21). The cuckold Milo, too, can comfortably make a joke about the lamp while not noticing, or pretending not to notice, that his guest is seducing his slave and that his wife is a witch. It is a fitting nar- rative twist, then, that the slave Photis not only clearly transgresses the mastery of Pamphile by allowing Lucius to spy on her and then to use her magic, but later seems also to have betrayed Milo in a more mun- dane way, by abetting the crime of robbery attributed to Lucius later in the novel. Milo and Pamphile both fail in their own surveillance of the single slave in their household, who by contrast knows all of its secrets. Lychnomancy is an egregious example of a common association between lamps and the supernatural.67 This aspect of lamps in ancient Greek and Latin literature offers another angle on the omniscience of Lucian's lamp in the True Histories', in the midst of many supernatural episodes, Lucian's interaction with his lamp could be the normal activity of an ancient lychnomancer. The simple expression of what Lucian finds out from his lamp (hapanta ekeina) indicates the comprehensiveness of the lamp's knowledge, but it obscures the style of the lamp's speech. The lack of direct speech in the Lychnopolis episode preserves the fantasy that the lamp's testimony would be free of the rhetorical baggage that a slave would carry: fear, self-interest, prejudice. In all of the non-Lucianic examples of speaking lamps, physical control (motion, the replenishment of oil, extinguishing) mimics a control of symbols: lamp owners are able to interpret the speech and signs of their lamps as they wish. But Lucian's satire liberates the lamp from the hand and ethos of its master, endowing it with freedom of movement and speech governed by its own morals. CONCLUSION: CREDI TU AVER A TRATTARE CON QUALCHE COSA INSENSATA?68 Such liberation is crucial to the reception of Lucian's lamps in the later literature. Two works of the Italian Renaissance clearly engage Lucian's lamps: Niccolo Franco, in Le Pistole Vulgari (1542), writes a letter to 67Ogden 2007, 217: "Ghost stories and ghost lore attract lamps as lamps do moths." Ogden's examples serve his analysis of the Philopseudes, but they are germane to my ar- gument as well. There are many other examples of lamps in magic to be found in Ogden 2002. 68Pona 1973,8.</page><page sequence="33">LUCIAN'S LYCHNOPOLIS 237 his lamp (dated 1538), asking for a confession of the immorality it has witnessed; the lamp responds with a thorough condemnation of various sectors of Franco's society.69 Francesco Pona similarly imagines a dia- logue between Eureta Misoscolo and his surly lamp (1625, briefly quoted above), which first argues with its owner about the quantity of oil it drinks and then claims to be the spirit of Sulla imprisoned in a lamp.70 Letizia Panizza addresses both of these works in connection with Lucian's lamps. Although she expresses some doubt regarding the meaning of the lamps in Lychnopolis, she argues that the lamp in the Downward Journey leads to a clearer symbolism that was exploited by the Cinquecento writer Niccolo Franco and other later writers: There are even social distinctions, but just what these lamps represent is unclear - the soul? its other life? ... [in the Downward Journey], this Lamp stands for mental and moral lucidity, and the need to speak out against injustice without delay.71 Franco's lamp, according to Panizza, inherits the moral wisdom of the lamp of Megapenthes. Its target is not a corrupt tyrant but Italian court society, which the lamp compares to slavery.72 Panizza calls the invective of the lamp "Dantesque," but surely it is Horatian as well; the moral indignation of Franco's lamp has precursors not only in Megapenthes' lamp but also in Horace's Davus (Sat. 2.7). It is easy to see in these satirists a shared parody of urban and intellectual pretensions. However, amidst demon- strations of extraordinary erudition - Franco's lamp compares the court's charms to those of Circe, with equally porcifying effects - it is also easy to overlook the less lofty moral lesson about slavery, an institution that may have presented just as many problems to Cinquecento Italy as to the second-century Roman Empire.73 We may justifiably downplay this motif in Lucian's Downward Journey and in Franco's Pistole Vulgari in favor of humanistic lessons; complaints about the voluntary slavery of people of all statuses have a firm hold in moral philosophy, endemic to the Stoic writings of Seneca. However, I would also recognize the arrogance of this discourse in a society in which legal, literal slavery is present, sanctioned, and firmly established. Meditating on the slavishness of one's peers or 69 Franco 1986. 70Pona 1973,27. 71 Panizza 2005, 83-84. 72 Panizza 2005, 86-87. 73 Davis 1966,42^43.</page><page sequence="34">238 SONIA SABNIS even of oneself alleviates the constant pressures of enforcing obedience and masterly authority in a slave society. Moreover, though Seneca at least is concerned with the treatment of slaves, reflection on the moral conduct of oneself and one's peers is safer for the intellectual elite; it poses no threat to the existence of slavery and the exploitation of slaves. Coming from the perspective of Italian Renaissance readers of Lucian, Panizza is unsure of the significance of the lamps of Lychnopolis; Georgiadou and Larmour set Lucian's philosophical satire above other concerns and are much more certain in their interpretation. But the reception of Lucian's speaking lamps that Panizza presents should gener- ate some further thoughts; it compels us to consider more carefully the strangeness of the polis aspect of Lychnopolis. Franco and Pona adapted the comfortable motif of epigram, the speaking lamp as the sole witness, confidant, and moral adviser. As I have argued, the literary breadth and cultural weight of this tradition enhance Lucian's fear in the True Histo- ries. But the private interaction that Lucian has with his own lamp must be understood within the carefully detailed order of the city, in which lamps are empowered not only as individuals but also as a citizenry. In Lucian's Lychnopolis, the omnipresent spectators, the silent witnesses of the most private affairs of the household, are everted and enfranchised, free to use their voices and reason. Slavery is but one of many social institutions to be examined through Lucian's satire, and Lychnopolis is a minor episode in the True Histories. Yet the unique features of the episode, its relationship to other works, and the longevity of the image of animated lamp compel readers to reflect upon the unstable mechanisms and philosophical implications of controlling slaves.74 Reed College e-mail: sabnis@reed.edu BIBLIOGRAPHY Anderson, Graham. 2003.
