Bishop Museum Press, Honolulu, Hawaii 1970 $4.50, paper J. Halley Cox with Edward Stasack has listed and described all the Hawaiian petroglyph sites presently recorded in the files of the Bishop Museum. There are over 135 such sites, and the petroglyphs vary greatly in number and variety of motifs at any one site. Petroglyphs are found on all Hawaiian Islands except Kahoolawe. The subject is introduced with some general statements about petroglyphs as a world-wide phenomenon. The authors believe that petroglyphs have a common character throughout the world, but areas have distinctive styles. The point is made that in Hawaii, as elsewhere, the present inhabitants have no knowledge of who made the petroglyphs, or when. At the same time, they do conclude that the Hawaiian petroglyphs were made by past Hawaiians. Two reasons are put forth for the similarities of petroglyph forms around the world : petroglyphs are a very simple and basic symbol and were made with stone tools on rock surfaces. The Hawaiians made more petroglyphs than any other Polynesian group. These sites are located mainly on the dry sides of the islands and in open country near the shore. Petroglyphs are found on five types of surfaces: pahoehoe (a highly viscous type of lava), waterworn boul- ders, cliff faces, cave walls and sand- stone beach shelves. The authors point out that the petro- glyph sites were not determined purely by the availability of a suitable surface. 235</page><page sequence="2">Where more than one type of surface is available, generally only one type was used. They conclude from this that "some cultural significance" was the determin- ing factor, and postulate three reasons for creating the petroglyphs: "(1) Re- cording of trips and communication con- cerning other events, on trails and at boundaries; (2) A concern for insuring long life and personal well-being; and (3) The commemoration of events and legends." Three subject categories are listed: the descriptive, the symbolic and the cryptic. The petroglyphs are discussed in re- lation to their connection with various aspects of Hawaiian culture, stressing the "unity of cultural patterns in Hawaiian life." This approach relates them to means of transportation, the family and the supernatural. Anthropomorphic fig- ures are by far the most numerous kind of petroglyph. Dogs, birds, turtles and chickens are the most common animals represented. Some design motifs consist of simple elements : dots, bars and circles in various combinations. Hawaiian petro- glyphs are generally found in groups, rather than as single isolated units. An aesthetic judgment of the chronol- ogy of some motifs places the lineal fig- ures as the earliest, followed in time by circles, with a general deterioration in workmanship through time. On Hawaii are found elements of new and old type Polynesian petroglyphs, some having dis- appeared from other parts of Polynesia in earlier times. This would seem to suggest a common origin for the widespread similar motifs, with regional variations developing through time. Cox and Stasack suggest one type of petroglyph as being uniquely Hawaiian. This is the muscled figure. They interpret this innovation as a move toward natural- ism in art form. The authors exhibit their artistic ex- pertise in their interpretive effort of the Hawaiian petroglyphs, relating this ar- tistic intuition to line, shape, color, tex- ture, pattern and organization of the ele- ments. They summarize this study by noting "that the Hawaiian petroglyph style has a surprisingly wide range of variation, with each type offering a dif- ferent quality of expression. Some are rugged and coarse, some refined and graceful, some rigidly static, others ac- tive. Gesture and articulation are often charming or humorous." The Hawaiian artists were definitely imbued with a sense of a creative process. The report is well illustrated with ex- cellent photographs and line drawings. A series of well drawn maps shows the lo- cations of the sites. Both the professional archaeologist and interested layman will find this report useful and easy to read. The authors have gone beyond the usual description and analysis of the sites and motifs, and have interpreted the petro- glyphs in the context of being an integral part of the ancient Hawaiian culture.
