<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE IDENTITY OF SHANG DI AND THE ORIGIN OF THE CONCEPT OF A CELESTIAL MANDATE (77AN MING ^)* Sarah Allan In the oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang j§J Dynasty (ca. 1600-1050 b.c.e.), the most powerful spirit is called Shang Di Ji'Sr. This term is vari ously translated in English as "high lord," "lord on high," "high god/' "supreme thearch," and even "God." In the transmitted textual tradition, from the Western Zhou jW| (ca. 1050-771 b.c.e.) on, Shang Di is closely related to tian and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Tian is conventionally translated as "heaven" when it is associated with spiritual power, but it literally means "sky." The translations of "God" and "heaven" effectively re-contextualize this relationship into a familiar Judeo-Christian one.1 This is clearly misleading; but who was Shang Di? And why are Shang Di and tian interchangeable? Some seventy years ago, Guo Moruo $and H.G. Creel argued that Shang Di was originally the high god of the Shang people and that tian, "sky," was that of the Zhou people.2 Although neither scholar refers to the other's work, their arguments are similar: in the oracle bone inscrip tions of the Shang Dynasty, Shang Di, the "high lord" is the highest power in the spirit world, but tian did not appear or, at least, did not receive offerings, whereas in transmitted literature from the beginning of the * I would like to thank Constance Cook, the members of the Early China Seminar at Columbia University, and the anonymous readers for Early China, for many help ful suggestions.

Thus, Guo and Creel propose, the Zhou rulers co-opted the Shang high god, Shang Di, identifying it with their own high god, Tian, after they conquered the Shang people. This hypothesis has been widely accepted and is often repeated.3 In the following, I will reexamine the question of the identity of Shang Di and offer an alternative hypothesis. I will propose that Shang Di was originally the spirit of the pole star. As such, it was the one celestial body which was higher than the ten suns, with whom the Shang ancestors were identified. Tian—the sky—was the location of the Shang Di and the other ancestral spirits. Thus, it was a wider term that came to serve as a euphemism for Shang Di or, more broadly, for Shang Di and all the celestial phenomena and spirits who were under his aegis. The primary distinction between the Shang and Zhou was not that Shang Di was particular to the Shang, but that the Shang rulers identified themselves with the ten suns. Shang Di, as the pole star, was acknowledged by both Shang and Zhou as the highest of the spirits. Tian, as the sky, was understood primarily as the celestial bodies that inhabit it. As a spiritual force, the sky was associated with patterns of time, which were revealed in the movements of the celestial bodies.4 Thus, the original Han ming ^ np ("celestial mandate" or "mandate of heaven") was, quite literally, an astronomical sign, a "command" seen in the sky during the reign of Wen ~$C, whose son Wu founded the Zhou Dynasty. The original stimulus for the hypothesis presented here was discov ering, while researching the role of Tai Yi ^— in the Warring States period, that Qian Baocong in his reconstruction of the night sky, designated the pole star as di ffr.5 Qian does not record the source of his names for the stars. However, the constellations of the Ziweiyuan in the north polar area, attributed to the Warring States astronomer Gan De Vi'iM, but probably reflecting early Han ideas, include a tian huang da di ^ %.fff ("Celestial resplendent great di").6 Similarly, the Shi ji 3.

That Keightley did not feel the need to provide a citation is an indication of the extent to which this hypothesis is now generally held to be valid. I have also previously accepted it in earlier writings; see, for example, Sarah Allan, The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China (Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1991), 39, with n74, and 59, and thereafter. 4.

It must be treated cau tiously nevertheless, because the Han rulers, following Qin precedent, were called huangdi jS-fff, rather than wang 3E ("king"), which was the Shang and Zhou title for living kings. Thus, the use of Di as the name of the pole star in the Qin and Han could be a projection of the title of the earthly ruler; just as the ruler of the earth was a di, so was that of the sky. Alternatively, however, the origin of the earthly title di for the ruler might have been a celestial one. If so, when the ruler of Qin, Zhao Zheng claimed that he was not simply wang, but the first huangdi, he was claiming divinity rather than the celestial mandate. Such a claim would make sense in light of Michael Puett's recent work on self-divinization in Warring States China.9 Moreover, the title suggests that he sought to claim power over the spirit world as well as "all-below-the sky" (tianxia A further stimulus was the recognition that, in both philosophy and divination, ban's authority derives from its physical reality as the sky.

AND TIAN MING physical force that controls human behavior are never distinguished in the textual tradition. Indeed, they are one and the same. Tian is not primarily the "blue stuff" that the English word "sky" so readily evokes, but the celestial bodies that inhabit it. These celestial bodies mark the patterns of time, so tian controls the fortunes of the natural world and human activity. In the natural world, the sky controlled the arrival of the seasons (shi B?f) upon which agriculture depended. When the celestial bodies occasionally go awry, as in eclipses, meteors, etc., these are signs of particular significance. By extension, the sky controlled the timely changes of dynasties in human history. The pole star was the conceptual center and thus the ruler of the sky. The evidence offered by Guo and Creel to support their hypothesis that Shang Di and Tian were different names for the high gods of differ ent peoples was as circumstantial as that which I offer here. However, I believe that my argument that Shang Di was identified with tian ("sky") because Shang Di was the pole star and controlled the celestial bodies provides a simpler and more efficient explanation for the available evi dence than has previously been attempted. I will further argue that this hypothesis provides a context for the origin of the idea of the tianming ^CnrT, conventionally translated as the "mandate of heaven" in the early Zhou Dynasty. David Pankenier has previously put forward some arguments that are closely related to those which I will make here. In some regards, our arguments converge and support one another. He has argued that the potency of Shang Di derives from its association with the pivot of the heavens at the North Pole, whereas I am arguing that the Pole Star—that is, the star which was used to determine a northward orientation—was called "Shang Di".10 We both understand Di's "commands" in oracle bone inscriptions as related to the Western Zhou theory of a celestial mandate.11 And he was the first to propose that Di's mandate was a real astronomical event seen in the sky in the reign of King Wen.12 However, we have very 10.

Although the star closest to the pole changed over periods of thousands of years because of the precession of the equinoxes, as Pankenier discusses in the latter paper, there was always a Pole Star by which buildings and tombs were oriented. This is clear from Pankenier's discovery that when the nearest star to the pole changed in the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age (the early second millennium b.c.e.), the north-south orientation of buildings also changed. 11.

See also his two-part article, "The Bamboo Annals Revisited: Problems</page><page sequence="5">SARAH ALLAN 5 different understandings of the evolution of cosmological and political thinking in ancient China and because our conceptual frameworks are so very different, our conclusions are fundamentally at odds with one another. Pankenier projects the idea of a changing mandate of heaven back to the beginning of the Xia M Dynasty and has maintained that at least as early as the foundation of the Xia Dynasty (beginning of the second millennium b.c.e.), unusually dense clusters of all five naked-eye planets occurred in conjunction with the foundation of a new dynasty. Thus, he explains the historical coincidences by hypothesizing that, "these extraordinary celestial portents actually influenced (my emphasis) political and military behavior."13 In other words, the founding rulers of the three dynasties conducted their military campaigns in response to celestial portents. My argument here is quite different. It is based upon contemporaneous evidence from Shang and Western Zhou oracle bone and bronze inscrip tions and my interpretative context is the reconstruction of Shang myth and cosmology that I outlined in The Shape of the Turtle.141 argued there that the Shang identified their ancestors with the ten suns and had a myth about the Xia as an earlier people who were their opposite, dark to their light, moons to their suns, dragons to their birds, night to their day, and so on. This myth was historicized at the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty, and provided the basis foundation for the idea of a dynastic cycle. My argument here is an attempt to explain how that system was transformed in the early Zhou by looking closely at the contemporaneous evidence. Thus, my argument for the identification of Shang Di with the pole star takes place within the context of my previous arguments concerning a correlation of the Shang ancestors, whose spirits were also called di in oracle bone inscriptions. More specifically, I argue that since Shang Di was identified with the pole star that controlled the skies, he was higher in status than the Shang ancestors who were identified with the suns. The Zhou did not share the Shang identification with the ten suns, but they did regard the stars as ancestral spirits, and shared a Shang belief in Shang Di as the celestial ruler. I will further argue, on the basis of early Western Zhou bronze inscrip tions, that a spectacular astronomical event took place in the sky during of Method in Using the Chronicle as a Source for the Chronology of Early Zhou," Bul letin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 55.2 (1992), 272-97; 55.3 (1992), 498-510. 13.

AND T1AN MING the reign of King Wen. This was used by his son, King Wu, to justify his overthrow of the Shang. The nature of this astronomical event is not clear from the inscriptions. It might have been a planetary conjunc tion, as Pankenier argues, but it could also have been a rare comet or a unique occurrence, such as a particularly impressive stellar outburst (nova), meteor, or even a supernova. After Wu defeated the Shang king, he claimed legitimacy, describing this event as a celestial mandate given to him by Shang Di. This claim became the basis of the later theory of a dynastic cycle and changing mandate of heaven.15 In other words, this astronomical event was the origin of the theory of dynastic cycle, which was not formulated until the Western Zhou Dynasty. At the core of Pankenier's theory is an argument for the authenticity of the astro nomical records in the "new text" version of the Zhushu jinian ("Bamboo Annals").16 In what follows, I will first look at the role of Shang Di and tian in Shang Dynasty oracle bone inscriptions. I will then examine how these terms are used in early Western Zhou bronze inscriptions and discuss the origin of the concept of celestial mandate. The Shang Dynasty I will argue below that the spirit known as Shang Di or simply Di in oracle bone inscriptions was identified with the pole star and thus that: 15. This argument does not preclude the possibility that there were a people, who called themselves the "Xia" and had suffered a defeat by the ancestors of the late Shang kings, or that the name "Xia" referred to inhabitants of Erlitou Z1JUJL Yanshi fBSP, in Henan Province, but, at present, there is no evidence for such an identification. For discussion of the role of this site, see my article, "Erlitou and the Foundation of Chinese Civilization," Journal of Asian Studies, 66.2 (2007), 461-97. 16. Pankenier argues for the authenticity of the records in the "new text" Annals on the grounds of what he takes to be a remarkable coincidence between the dates of the planetary conjunctions recorded as marking the foundation of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou Dynasties, and real astronomical events. However, he also calculates the dates for the founding of these dynasties on the basis of the real astronomical events. This argument impresses me as circular and I see no evidence of a literary or oral context in which such records would have been transmitted before the Western Zhou Dynasty. The recent publication of a Warring States period Chu script bamboo slip manuscript in the Shanghai Museum collection, Bao Shuya yu Xi Peng zhi jian W., which refers to a solar eclipse as late as the mid-seventh century b.c.e. that cannot be matched with the historical records of actual celestial phenomena, should strike a cautionary note about the astronomical records in Warring States texts.

Shang Di was located in the sky, where he had a court of five "min isters" (chen E5), and "commanded" (ling ti~) natural phenomena, and so was a single figure who ruled the sky, just as the king ruled the earth.17 2. The Shang ancestors, beginning with Shang Jia _h were classi fied with one of the ten suns and received their offerings on the day that the corresponding sun was present. Shang Di shared the title di with Shang ancestors in the main line of descent. Thus, the ancestors and Shang Di were of the same nature. 3. Shang Di was higher than Shang Jia and the Shang approached him through their ancestors. The only celestial body considered higher than the suns was the pole star. 4. The pole star controlled the configurations of stars that marked the passage of time. Thus, Shang Di as the pole star was the lord of the sky and the first ancestor. Shang Di as Ruler of the Sky From oracle bone inscriptions, we know that Shang Di had the power to "send down" (jiang P$) and "command" (ling fi~) weather phenomena. That he sent weather down suggests that he was located in the sky.18 That he commanded the weather suggests a political analogy and this is confirmed by references to weather phenomena, such as rain, thunder, and lightning, as Di's envoys (shi {]£). This analogy of a court ruled by Di is supported by references to Di having five "ministers." The identity of the ministers is unclear and various opinions have been offered. They might be associated with the quadrates of the north, south, east, west, and center, and/or the constellations that represented them. Alternatively, they might have been the spirits of the five visible planets. Or perhaps they were simply the weather phenomena. In any case, the use of the 17- See also David Pankenier, "The Cosmo-political Background of Heaven's Mandate/' 220-24. 18.

Nevertheless, it suggests an analogy between the authority of Shang Di and that of the king. Di held the greatest power among the spirits. Other ancestors could also send down curses of various types, but it was Di that was respon sible for catastrophes (huo }|i|). He was closely associated with weather phenomena. Besides weather and harvest, the Shang rulers divined to determine whether Di would sanction or curse major plans, including warfare and settlement building. This might suggest other kinds of power, but unusual or untimely weather patterns and crop failure would have been one of most effective means of bringing destruction, including defeat at war and the failure of a settlement. Thus, the essence of Di's authority was his power over the sky. The sky is not only the source of particular weather events, it also controls time and the proper course of the seasons. Concomitantly, the greatest responsibility of the ruler was to perform the rites according to the proper calendar. Shima Kunio and Robert Eno have hypothesized that Shang Di was a collective term for a group of high ancestors, rather than a single spirit.21 I do not think that this can be supported by the oracle bone evidence, for the following reasons: 1. Di gave specific "commands" to "ministers," just as the king did. This suggests he was a single figure. 2. The bin t5 "hosting" rite (see below) is performed by the Shang king to a single named ancestor and by the ancestors to a single higher ancestor. An ancestor may also perform this rite to Shang Di. Since single ancestral spirits are the recipients of the rite, we may reasonably surmise that Shang Di is also singular. 3. The theory that Shang Di was a collective term is inconsistent with his role in Western Zhou inscriptions and the entire tradition of 19- HuHouxuan, "Yinbucizhongdeshangdihewangdi," 1959.9,48;ChenMengjia, Yinxu buci zongshu, 572; Allan, The Shape of the Turtle, 101; Pankenier, "The Cosmo political Background of Heaven's Mandate," 171 and nioi. 20. In oracle bone inscriptions, the object often appears before the verb, sometimes marked by wei ff£ or S; this leads to some ambiguity in the fragments, but I have not found any clear exceptions to this observation. 21.

In the Zhou period and later, Di was always regarded as a single figure. Thus, if the term Shang Di referred to a group of high ancestors in the Shang Dynasty, then the mean ing of the term would have had to change from a group of Shang ancestors to a single supreme spirit at the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty. This seems to me unlikely. The Shang and the Ten Suns The close relationship between the Shang and the sun or suns in both oracle bone inscriptions and the later textual tradition has been noticed by many scholars. I have presented a more comprehensive hypothesis elsewhere concerning the relationship of the Shang ancestors and the ten suns. According to this hypothesis, the ten cyclical characters, later known as tian gan ("celestial stems"), were originally the names of ten suns who rose from the Mulberry Tree in the East, one on each day of the week, to fly across the sky as birds.22 They are also used in Shang oracle bone inscriptions for the ten days of the xun 'I]-week and the Shang ancestors were classified according to the ten sun-categories and received their offerings on the corresponding day. If we understand totemism as a system of classification, then this was a totemic system in which the ancestors and suns were correlated with one another. The Shang ancestors were present and able to receive offerings on a certain day because the sun with which they were classified was present. This system of classification by sun-category is apparent in the naming style of the Shang ancestors, but it was not used by the Zhou. In Shang oracle bone divination, ancestors are addressed by a kinship title, such as fu (father) or mil £5 (mother), followed by 6ne of the ten cyclical characters, later known as celestial stems (tian gan ^~p), jia Ef, yi Z., bing , etc. Another naming style is an epithet rather than kinship title, in combination with a cyclical character; for example, Bao Yi Z., Bao Bing j?f. Fu Jia commonly translated as "Father Jia," more pre cisely means the male ancestor of the father's generation belonging to the jia category. Bao Yi is the Bao ancestor, of the y;-sun ritual category. Whereas the Shang identified themselves with the ten suns and classified their ancestors accordingly, the Zhou used personal names or epithets for 22. See Sarah Allan, "Sons of Suns," 290-326.

AND TIAN MING their ancestors. After the Zhou conquest, the Shang style of nomenclature for ancestors using sun-categories continues to be found in some bronze inscriptions, but these can be understood as bronzes cast by the Shang descendants and peoples closely related to them. In the Shi ji, the only genealogy of a feudal state recorded in the "Hereditary Houses" (Shi jia tit Hi) that retains the Shang style of nomenclature with sun-categories is that of the early rulers of the state of Qi.23 If this argument is correct, the claim of an association between ances tors and the suns was the mark of the Shang people. The use of the cii as an ancestral title was also specific to the Shang. The Annals ("Ben ji" section of the Shi ji includes genealogies of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou rulers. In these genealogies, the Xia and Shang rulers are called di, whereas the Zhou kings are always called wang 3E ("king"), the title given them in bronze inscriptions.24 In oracle bone inscriptions, however, living rulers are called wang-, the term di is reserved for royal ancestors. For example, the father of the penultimate king, Di Yi 21, is called Wenwu ("Cultural and Martial") Ding Itt T or Wenwu Di iiit'fff (or, written as a joined character, "Wenwuding Di").25 This suggests that Sima Qian compiled his genealogy on the basis of an ancestral list, which used the title di rather than records of living kings. Shang _h means "high," in the literal sense of above or "superior," which, for ancestors, signifies the most ancient. Thus, Shang Di may be understood as the di on high and/or the superior or most ancient di. In oracle bone inscriptions, as in transmitted texts and inscriptions in the Zhou Dynasty, Shang Di is usually called simply Di; that is, he is the di. As an ancestral title in oracle bone inscriptions, di is a status marker that differentiates some ancestors from others, rather than a kinship term. Not all Shang ancestors are called di. Chen Mengjia suggested that the oracle bone usage of the term di reflects the arrangement of the altars in the ancestral temple.26 The predominant hypothesis is that it signified ancestors in the main line of descent, as opposed to those 23.

Chen Mengjia, Yinxu buci zongshu, 440, argued that di was a temple altar or tablet, citing the "Qu li" jf] fit chapter of the Liji fit 12, which says that "the tablet (zhu i) set up in the temple is called di." While it is certainly possible that the status marked by the title di had a physical representation in the temple, the use of the adjective wenwu ("cultural and martial") before di in the oracle bone inscriptions suggests that the term di referred to the ancestor rather than to a tablet.</page><page sequence="11">SARAH ALLAN 11 belonging to collateral branches.27 The particular significance of di as a marker that differentiated the status of a former king lost its relevance after the Zhou conquest since Zhou succession practices were different than those of the Shang and the Zhou did not use the term di as an ancestral title. In Western Zhou bronze inscriptions, di is not used to mark a particular ancestral status, but it does occur with the general sense of "ancestor." In the expression, huang zu di kao zu and kao are terms for ancestors.28 Huang is an adjective that often modifies ancestors in Zhou bronze inscriptions, as it does here. It is conventionally translated as "au gust." Besides ancestors, it commonly modifies Shang Di, the sky (tian), and celestial bodies. The bronze inscription form () resembles a sun or star with rays over the phonetic, wang 3i, and probably first represented the cognate word now written with a fire radical, fM-29 Other adjectives conventionally used to describe ancestral spirits in bronze inscriptions include ming Hfl, "bright," and xian if}, "illustrious," which also refer to light. Thus, Constance Cook explains this usage of huang as "the yellow and white spotted light of the (corona?) of the ancestral spirit."30 This 27.

AND TIAN MING 55^ association of the di with the sky and shining light suggests that they were celestial bodies. Di as an ancestral title, or as a title for living rulers, is not found in received literature or bronze inscriptions from the Western Zhou period, except with reference to Di Yi, the penultimate king of the dynasty.31 A possible explanation for his special status is that he was the father of Weizi Qi the Shang prince who was enfeoffed by the Zhou conquerors in the state of Song yfc to carry on the ancestral sacrifices.32 In other words, the retention of the title di in the name of Di Yi may be attributed to his status as the founding ancestor of the Shang descendants in the state of Song. Furthermore, the use of the title di for the pre-dynastic rulers, Yao f§, Shun 0, and Yu p|, cannot be attested before the Eastern Zhou period. Although the Zhou did not refer to their ancestors with the title di and did not call them by sun-categories, the term Shang Di occurs in Western Zhou bronze inscriptions from the conquest period on, as I shall discuss below. This pattern suggests that it was the Shang identification with the ten suns and lineage structure that distinguished the Shang kings from the Zhou, not their adherence to Shang Di. Shang Di as the Supreme di Chen Mengjia argued that the kings were not related to Shang Di by blood and that Di was a nature spirit, rather than an ancestor, whose primary power was over weather phenomena and agriculture, on the grounds that the Shang kings did not make offerings directly to Shang Di.33 Qiu Xigui, on the other hand, has argued that the term di was used to distinguish ancestors in the main line of descent from collateral branches; thus, Shang Di was the first di and should be understood as a direct ancestor of the Shang.34 Qiu's argument that the use of the term di for Shang Di means that he was ancestral to the Shang kings is, I believe, logical. However, that the Shang were direct descendants of Shang Di does not mean the Shang were his only descendants or that he was their lineage spirit.

This would explain why the Zhou claimed his sanction when they conquered the Shang. In oracle bone inscriptions, Shang Jia is the highest (most ancient) ancestor who is called by one of the ten sun-names. He is also the first ancestor to receive offerings in the routine cycle of ritual offerings. This suggests that he was regarded as the founding ancestor of the Shang royal lineage. Above him were "high ancestors" who were simply called by their personal names, including Jun (also transcribed as Nao Hf or Kui is) and Shang Jia's father, Wang Hai Jun, written as [life, is also known from later myth as the husband of Xihe HfO, who gave birth to the ten suns.35 Shang Di was at the top of the pyramid. He was higher than the royal ancestors and they sometimes "played host to" (bin) him, presumably to obtain favor for their descendants. The bin rite is unique in the oracle bone divinations, because it was performed by living rulers to ancestors who then "hosted" higher an cestors of the same sun-category. They could then "host" Shang Di. For example, Fu Yi Z, (yz-ancestor of the father's generation) could host Zu Yi Z. (yz-ancestor of the grandfather's or an earlier generation) on the yi day.36 It is also performed to the rising and setting suns, which may, in effect, be a performance to the ancestors associated with those suns. This rite, together with the pattern of ritual offerings in which the ancestors were given their offerings on the day corresponding to their name, were supporting evidence for my earlier hypothesis that the ancestors were only present and able to receive sacrifice when the sun with which they were totemically classified was present in the sky. Although ancestors played host to other ancestors belonging to the same sun-categories, ancestors of different sun-categories could "play host to" (bin) Shang Di. For example, we find a series of divinations on a single turtle plastron about whether one of several different ancestors would "host" (bin) Di. The divination proposes offerings to one jia ancestor and two yi ancestors.37 That ancestors of different sun-categories might bin Di suggests that regardless of which sun was in the sky, Shang Di was present. If Di was a constant presence in the sky, who was ances tral and higher than the suns but of a similar nature to them, and then he could only be the pole star. Whether or not Shang Di ever received direct sacrifices from the Shang rulers is contested. Most scholarly literature in the field states that he never received sacrifices or that they were extremely rare. An important 35- See Allan, The Shape of the Turtle, 31-36, for a discussion of these figures. 36. Heji, 1657. 37.

Moreover, sentences are often inverted in oracle bone writing, with the object placed before the verb to give it stress when it is the focus of the divination.38 And, of course, many sentences are fragmentary. Thus, the determination of how particular inscriptions should be read frequently depends on grammatical analysis and/or decisions about punctuation.39 However, even if direct offerings to Shang Di are not found in the extant oracle bone inscriptions, we cannot be certain that they were not made, especially if such offerings were only made on rare occasions. Although there is no clear evidence of rites performed directly to Shang Di in Shang Dynasty oracle bone inscriptions, there is evidence of such a rite in a late Shang bronze inscription, the Ersi ZLffi (2nd year) Ge Qi you ft] (the first graph is often transcribed as Bi ®). This vessel is one of three late Shang you, with second, fourth, and sixth year dates, unearthed in the 1940s. Zhang Zhenglang challenged the authenticity of the inscription when it first appeared and this may explain why it was not discussed when the hypothesis that Di did not receive direct sacrifice was first formulated.40 However, X-ray examination of the vessels in 38. In my analysis of the graphs for the attached tables, I have generally assumed that the graph refers to the performance of the di-rite unless it is in the position of a noun or an ancestral title, but there are many examples that are not clear. Of particular interest are the inscriptions recorded in Heji 22073 22075/ which do record offerings to Di, including not only rites to be performed but animals to be offered (see Table 3). It is noteworthy, however, that the graphs in these two Li diviner-group inscriptions are highly unusual variants. See Yinxu jiagu keci leizuan ed. Yao Xiaosui and Xiao Ding j^T (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1989), 422, which classifies the graph as di See also Xiaotun nandi jiagu #, ed. Zhongguo shehui kexueyuan kaogu yanjiusuo (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1983), 1147 (hereafter, Xiaotun). 39. A challenge to the predominant view that few, if any, offerings were made to Shang Di is found in Shi Shaohua H§ljS, Zhao Dehua Zheng Xinzhu and Zhao Fuyong $1H, "Luelun buci zhong suojian ji shang di zhi li" B§it 41 Zhongguo guwenzi daxi: jiagu wenxian jicheng ISfiJc, 485-502 (rpt. from Taizhong jiagu xuehui S43 ¥Jiaguwen lunwenji ¥#3tfli3tlll, 1993)- One problem with their analysis is that they do not take into account the grammar of oracle bone inscriptions in which the object is often inverted and placed before the verb. For example, the expression/aw# di ^ (?$) is interpreted in this article as a fang-rite performed to Di, rather than a di-rite performed to the four fang (directional quadrates). Most of their examples can, in my opinion, be better resolved in this manner, although there remain some problematic divinations. Shima Kunio, Inkyo bokuji kenkyu, looff., takes a small square, conventionally transcribed as ding T, as representing di.

Zhang thought that the inscription on the bottom might have been added to the Ersi Ge Qi you. He also mentions that he discussed this with Hu Houxuan and other scholars early on. These scholars did not use the inscriptions in their research. However, a number of prominent scholars thought the vessels and their inscriptions were genuine, e.g., Ding Shan T [i|, GuoMoruo, DongZuobin JlfFll, ChenMengjia, Yu Xingwu fj-, and Li Xueqin. These vessels are also known as Zuoce Zhi zi you This is the name used by Robert Bagley in Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M. Sackler Collections (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1987).

The last two characters, which I read as Shang Di, are read by some scholars as shang xia di _hTr'$r. This reading is based upon the assumption that the line above di is part of a joined character, shangxia, in which one line has been omitted. See, for example, Yin Zhou jinwen jicheng shiwen ed. Zhongguo shehui kexueyuan kaogu yanjiusuo (Hong Kong: Xianggang Zhongwen daxue Zhongguo wenhua yanjiusuo 2001), 4.156 (no. 5412). However, the closely related Sisi Ge Qi you (157, no. 5413) refers to Wenwu di and the character for di there also has two lines at the top, a form commonly found in oracle bone inscriptions of the period. Thus this line should be part of di, not the lower part of a joined character and the phrase should be read as Shang Di, as it is, for example, in Jinwen yinde: Yin-Shang Xi-Zhou juan f#: ISfSHJSI #, ed. Huadong shifan daxue Zhongguo wenzi yanjiu yu yingyong zhongxin ljl|t (Nanning: Guangxi jiaoyu, 2001), 156 (no. 2823).

Possibly, the offering to Shang Di mentioned in the second-year Ge Qi you inscription was associated with rites of accession. It is also possible that Di Xin felt it necessary to make special sacrifices to shore up his crumbling regime. As we shall see below, the Zhou rulers made sacrifices to Shang Di in order to establish that they had gained Di's authority. The Oracle Bone Graphs for di There are a number of hypotheses about the origin and significance of the oracle bone graph for di ^r.

Although it has long been recognized that graphic variation sometimes occurs when the character is used in the sense of the rite, to my knowledge, no comprehensive analysis has been made of the vari ant forms. Moreover, the oracle bone inscription concordances, such as Shima Kunio's J? Inkyo bokujisorui IS:® h and Yao Xiaosui's Yinxu jiagu keci leizuan do not systematically distinguish between the different usages or, indeed, between the vari ant forms.

The inscriptions then divide into two lines. The North Branch inscriptions are the most numerous and the graphic forms found in the Bin diviner-group are often taken as standard for oracle bone writing. However, there are very many examples of the dz-rite mentioned in South Branch inscriptions, particularly those of the Li diviner-group, and many of the unusual graphic forms of di and di frjS are associated with this branch. There is also a "non-kings' school," but I have not found oracle bone graphs for either di 'ft' or di in the non-kings' school. This could be accidental, but it suggests that only the king divined about Shang Di and only he used the title di for his ancestors. It also suggests that the performance of the dz-rite to the four directions was a royal prerogative. Let us first look at the forms of the character that are used in the sense of di $r. The standard form of the graph in oracle bone inscriptions is: This graphic form is by far the most common for all periods and diviner groups. It is used where the word indicated is an ancestral title and for Shang Di. It also occurs as a variant for the dz-rite (?$), but it is not the standard graph for that word (See Tables 1 and 3). This form of the character serves as the foundation for a variant in which an additional line is added at the top: f. This form is more com mon in later periods. Significantly, it is associated with contexts where di (Shang Di or an ancestor) is a more likely reading than di (perform a rite). This variant is also found in the Ersi and Sisi Ge Qi you inscrip tions and in the inscription on the recently discovered Ban fang ding Wl Jj Jfrf.48 The additional line at the top suggests the element _L (shang _h). However it is an element of the graph di, not a joined-character (hewen tHT ), because the graph JL is found above it in the expression shang di JlW; for example, in the Ersi Ge Qi you inscription (last line of the rub 48.

The variant in which the central vertical line bisects the upper triangle, remains common and is found on a Zhouyuan oracle bone inscription in the name of the Shang ancestor, Wenwu Di Yi. However, the other two Zhou oracle bone inscriptions which include this character have the graphic form in which the upper triangle is not bisected t^1. In one example, the graph refers to a rite per formed to kings Wen and Wu; in the other it is a single character.

The Shuowen form of di ^ is j^. According to Xu Shen, this graph means: "To scrutinize (di f§). It is an epithet for one who is king of all-under-the-sky. It is from -1-; ^ (ci ifl) is the phonetic, ft: is the old script (guwen "j^f X) form of di fff. All characters with -1 are written as —- in archaic script, but in the clerical script, they come from _H. JL is the archaic script form of shang _h ('above')." Xu Shen's 'old script' form in this entry does not correspond to the oracle bone character and his explanation has been rejected by modern scholarship. From the point of view of my argument below, that he takes at the top as a distinct element, meaning shang ±, is noteworthy. 2.

This explanation appears to be based upon a form of the character in which the central vertical does not bisect the upper triangle. Guo Moruo, apparently having noticed that the standard form of the oracle bone character has a central vertical which bisects the upper triangle, amended Wang's hypothesis, by explaining it as a stamen in a seed pod. However, this hypothesis is only convincing for the variant in which the central vertical does not bisect the upper triangle, so it is unlikely that it was the origin of the graph. Moreover, I find it difficult to visualize the central horizontal element: \~~I as a reasonable abstraction of the leaves of a calyx. 3. Ye Yusen and others have argued that the character should be analyzed as a bundle of firewood, tied together, or placed in a frame, and used in a burning sacrifice. This takes the crossed lines in di as a reference to liao M, an important sacrifice in Shang divinations, written in oracle bones as jji" or Similarly, Ken'ichi Takashima takes this part of the graph as a marker signifying bind ing or stringing together, and Di as a nominal derivation of di W, "to bind; knit together," that is, "the one who binds (the cosmos) together."54 Once again, however, these analyses do not adequately account for the central horizontal element. The significance of the line (or lines) at the top of the character is also unclear. 4. David Pankenier has hypothesized that the character represents a star-chart or device connecting three bright stars in the scoop of Ursa Minor (y px) with three bright stars in the handle of Ursa Major (£ e 5), so that they cross at a point that corresponds closely with the pole position.55 He then takes the horizontal line as joining the two closest stars, Thuban, the likely pole star of Neolithic times, and k Dra, the pole star in the Han Dynasty cult. He assumes that the vertical lines at the end of the central horizontal element \~i are simply cross-hatching. His explanation may well be correct. However, this combination of stars is not a known Chinese con stellation and there is no other evidence to indicate the existence of such a device. A common difficulty with all of these hypotheses is that they do not adequately account for the central horizontal element \~i. As I noted above, the standard form of the graph, is also used for the d/-rite. 54- See Ito Michiharu and Ken'ichi Takashima, Studies in Early Chinese Civilization, 1.145. 55. David W.

This hypoth esis is confirmed by a related series of oracle bone graphs. For example, fang is written in oracle bone inscriptions as Fang means "square" or "rectangle" and the di-sacrifice is usually performed to the four fang ("quadrates") of the north, south, east, and west. As I have argued previ ously, the earth in the Shang cosmos was understood as having a cross or ya 35 shape, with four notional quadrates in the cardinal directions surrounding a central square.57 The central horizontal element H can be understood as a carpenter's tool for drawing and making squares.58 This tool is shown in the oracle bone form of the character ju "carpenter's square," where it is held in the hand of a standing man iJ. Two such tools in the form of a cross form the oracle bone character This graph is usually transcribed wu M, "shaman," and this transcription is probably valid for the diviner groups of the North Branch.

The element |—I is also found as an element in the conceptually related oracle bone graph, yang T ("center").59 The carpenter's square depicted in these oracle bone graphs was, I believe, a more primitive instrument than the modern T-square or the L-square often seen in the hands of Fu Xi {£it and Nii Wa "UWh in Han Dynasty stone reliefs.

The L-square, which always has a bar connecting the right angles, was probably an advance over the T as it requires the ability to calibrate a right angle (rather than simply equalize the two sides). Possibly, people had discovered the mathematical formula in which a triangle with three sides in the proportions of 3, 4, and 5 results in a perfect right angle, as was known to the ancient Egyptians. The tool depicted in the oracle bone inscriptions is simpler. It is made up of a horizontal bar with two perpendicular bars attached to its ends. With such a tool, it is possible to make two perfectly parallel lines, and thus a square. By holding one end in place, the tool could also be used as a compass—and by using the two functions together, it is possible to plot perfect right angles. If we take this element as signifying "square" (now written as ju E), the rest of the character may be interpreted as a combination of semantic elements. If we remove the element 1 from the standard first-period Bin diviner-group form, we have A, that is, mu 7^, "tree". These elements are surmounted by a single horizontal line —; or, in the variant: by a double one. In oracle bone inscriptions, the graph for shang _h, "above," is A single line at the top of a graph often carries the same meaning, as the Shuowen observed. Another example in oracle bone writing is the graph for tian 5c, which may have one or two lines (see below). None of the three elements (shang _h, mu vfc, ju 5) in di could be phonetic, but "above," "tree," and "square" do make sense as semantic elements in a "combined meaning character" (huiyi zi if Di is the spirit of the pole star. In this case, the tree would be the axis mundi at the center of the central quadrate of the earth.60 With regard to the variant form in which the central vertical does not bisect the upper triangle, if we remove the central horizontal element \~~I, we have which is read in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions as either bu or pi 2S. Pi means "great" or "glorious" and has been interpreted as a pictograph of the calyx and seed pod (beilei iSFlf) of a flower. This ties in with the flower imagery associated with di fjf and was supporting evidence for the theory that di 'ffr was a phonetic borrowing from fl?.61 This does not appear to be the origin of the graph meaning di ffr, but it remains possible that it played a role in its later evolution. 60. For discussion of the axis mundi and the importance of centrality in Shang thought, see Sarah Allan, Shape of the Turtle, 44-45.1 also argue therein that the Shang understood the earth as having a central quadrate with four mythical regions to the north, south, east, and west. 61.

This usage is normally verbal. We have also seen that the variant ^ is usually used with this sense. A survey of the major collections revealed several other, less common, graphic variants; these are also found in inscriptions where the context suggests the graph refers to the performance of the dz-rite. The most common variant has a circle or loop rather than a square *C62 Even though the carpenter's square could also be used as a compass, as mentioned above, I suspect that this variation is simply calligraphic and has no semantic meaning. In a few examples (predominantly Li diviner-group), the vertical bars are omitted from the central horizontal element ^,63 or the entire element may be missing, as in F.64 These omissions are possibly inadvertent or a kind of shorthand, but it is noteworthy that they only occur for the di-rite; they do not occur with reference to Shang Di. A few variants have short strokes added above the character (^)65or within the triangle.66 Their meaning is unclear, but this variant is always a rite, so I suspect that they indicate a joined character; perhaps with mi 3ft, "rice."67 As I noted above, the usual recipients of dz'-rite in oracle bone inscrip tions are the quadrates (fang Jj) of the four directions: north, south, east, and west. These were the homes of the four winds, and divinations about offering the dz'-rite often refer to pacifying the wind. The dz'-rite is also offered to "bird" (niao ,^)68 and "tiger" (ha J^).69 These are probably the red bird and white tiger constellations of the South and West. This suggests the possibility that the directional quadrates were governed by their constellations; that is, the offerings to the directional quadrates were offerings to the constellations who governed them.70 Thus, Shang 62.

Although the rite found in oracle bone inscriptions is conventionally transcribed as di fijj, it is not clear that the Shang rite is the antecedent of the di-hte found in Western Zhou bronze inscriptions and/or the rite found in the later textual tradition. The graph found in Western Zhou bronze inscriptions has a mouth at the bottom of the character to distin guish it from di Thus it does not derive from any of the graphic variants that designated the rite in oracle bone inscriptions. The ritual function of this di-rite is also very different from that of the Shang rite. There are a few inscriptions in the oracle bone corpus in which the di rite is offered to Shang ancestors, nature spirits, and other spirits whose identity is unclear, but the Shang rite is primarily associated with the directional quadrates and their winds. The Western Zhou rite, on the other hand, was offered to Zhou ancestors but not performed to the direc tional quadrates. So it is not clear that the Zhou dz'-rite is the descendant of the Shang di-rite. The ritual functions ascribed to the di ?ft5-rite in the transmitted tradition are conflicting, but they do not correspond to those suggested by either Shang or Zhou inscriptions. One traditional explanation of the df-rite is that it was performed by the king to the founding ancestor of his lineage. Thus, in the Li ji fit HE, we are told that the Yin (Shang) performed the dz'-rite to Ku §, which the Tang 0 Dynasty commentator Zhao Kuang M M. explains as meaning that Ku was their original ancestor.71 This may be why Confucius stated that he did not want to watch the performance of the rite after the libation was poured.72 However, there is very little evi dence for this usage in more ancient times. In one oracle bone inscription (Heji 14748), the object of the rite is the high ancestor Wang Hai 3i2£, who was progenitor of the Shang Jia _h^, the first of the Shang ancestors to be identified with one of the ten sun designations.73 But, this inscription is unique. The di-rite found in Western Zhou bronze inscriptions, on the other hand, was performed to ancestors, but there are no inscriptions in which it was performed to the lineage founder. 1565, have divinations with the expression yu bei di ~f ^it'Sr (?§), which could be taken as "to the northern Di." However, if they are so interpreted, neither of these divinations names a rite, so they are more likely to be inverted phrases, meaning, "To the North, offer the d/-rite." In any case, the cosmology suggested by the performance to the four quadrates found in the four directions corresponds with my analysis of the d/'-graph. 71. Lijijijie fltlS Jl ffl, ed.

For example, some take the di-rite as a verbal form of the noun found in the expression Shang Di. A traditional interpretation of the rite is that it was a sacrifice to sky/heaven (tian) by the king. This inter pretation follows the commentaries on Zheng Xuan's HPS designation of the Shang hymn, "Chang fa" H§|, in the Shijing as a "great dz-rite" hi the Analects, Confucius also exclaims that the person who could explain the dz-rite could manage the empire as though it were in the palm of his hand.75 However, there are no examples in the extant corpus of oracle bone and bronze inscriptions in which the di-rite was offered to Shang Di (or to tian), so the semantic relationship, if any, is not clear. The Sky in Oracle Bone Inscriptions Before turning to the role of Shang Di in bronze inscriptions, let us look at that of tian in Shang oracle bone inscriptions. As we have seen, the references to Shang Di sending down lightning, thunder, and other weather phenomena suggest that Shang Di was located in the sky and I have hypothesized that, as the pole star, Shang Di controlled the celestial bodies, thus controlling the days, months, and seasons. Many scholars have observed that in oracle bone divination, sky/heaven (tian) was not an object of ritual performance. In order to understand the relationship between Di and tian at the beginning of the Zhou, we will first look at the role of tian in Shang oracle bone inscriptions before turning to the evidence for the Western Zhou. Once again, graphic confusion makes analysis of the meaning of the inscriptions difficult. There are two problems that have caused confusion. 1. The graph for tian "sky" may be interchanged with that for da jZ, "big" or "great." Where the graph functions as an adjective, both words make sense. However, there are some examples related to weather, where I believe that the graph usually read as da should be understood as tian. 2. Tian is a relatively common name in oracle bone and Shang bronze inscriptions. Thus, an offering to tian may refer to an ancestor or to the sky. The oracle bone graph for da jz is written as a person with arms and legs extended, j\. The graph for tian Ji. is the same but has a square, circle, 74- See Mao shi buzheng fit IE, ed.

Once again, this element probably signifies shang _h, "above". These forms are also found in Western Zhou bronze inscriptions where they are transcribed as tian 5c and carry the meaning of sky/heaven.76 In another graphic form, usually understood as a variant of tian, the vertical line bisects the two horizontal lines above it, This variant is found in inscriptions classified as belonging to the Wu ^ diviner group, a non-kings diviner-group found at the Xiaotun Nandi (Locus South) site.77 The divinations made by this group of diviners date to the earliest period of divination at Anyang (ca. fourteenth to thirteenth century b.c.e.). One of the inscriptions is a divination about offering an ox (or oxen) in a rite of exorcism.78 Since this divination was by a non-kings' diviner group, this was not a royal sacrifice. The sky here may be a nature spirit, like the rivers and mountains. Alternatively, since tian was a common personal name in the ancestral dedications on Shang and Zhou bronzes, it may have been the name of a non-royal ancestral spirit. The Shuo wen defines tian by its homophone dian J®, "crown," "fore head," "beginning." It also states that tian is "the highest that has nothing above it; [the graph] is from 'one' and 'great' (jUttl, l/t—J\)." Another oracle bone character, which is often transcribed as tian has both a line and square above the standing person, ^. This character occurs in a first-period divination about "making ill my X".79 The reading tian ^ "sky" makes no sense and it is better read as dian, "forehead." As Creel observed, most examples of oracle bone graphs transcribed as tian represent a place or personal name and do not mean "sky" or "heaven". Creel further argued that in those inscriptions where the gram matical position of the graph is that of an adjective, it is interchangeable with ^ (da Thus, he concluded that all of these examples should be read as da and that there is no character signifying tian Jz in the oracle bone inscription corpus. This conclusion supported his argument that tian was a Zhou deity identified with Shang Di after the Zhou conquest. 76. For compilations of various scholarly interpretations of this character, see Jiagu wenzi gulin, 210-14 (0198)/ Jinwen gulin, 24-35 (1-0003); Jinwen gulin bu (Taibei: Zhongyang yanjiuyuan Lishi yuyan yanjiusuo ffiffilf, 1982),1.93-105. 77. The editors of Xiaotun nandi jiagu, xiace T fitt, 1.992, transcribe the character as ^ and note that tian is the object of the sacrifice here and that this is a peculiarity of the Wu diviner group. The character is also transcribed in this manner in Yinxu jiagu keci leizuan, 3.84. See also Jiagu wenzi gulin, 214 (0201), where it is separated, but also transcribed as tian. 78. Xiaotun, 2241. 79. Ji zhen X, Heji, 20975; see als0 We;'/, 17985.</page><page sequence="28">28 SHANG DI _h# AND TIAN MING Creel's argument that tian does not occur in oracle bone inscriptions with the meaning of "sky" or "celestial" is not convincing. The charac ters usually transcribed as ^ and were interchangeable at the end of the Shang Dynasty, as Creel noted. Most importantly, in fifth-period divinations, the Shang settlement (yi Shang e [ft ) is modified both by a graph usually transcribed as tian Jc,80 and by one transcribed as da j^.81 Both expressions probably refer to the same settlement that Wu Ding divined about building in first-period inscriptions. Making and dwelling in "this settlement" (ci yi e§, ), as it was usually called in the first period, required Di's sanction; he might approve it, but he could also command misfortune for it.82 Di might even "bring an end" (zhong $§•) to it.83 In recent years, archaeologists have discovered a walled settlement north of the Huan H River, which was abandoned around the reign of Wu Ding (ca. 1250-1192 b.c.e.). Although the historical record states that Yin was the capital founded by Pan Geng SHJt, the major occupation of the Xiaotun site begins with Wu Ding's reign. In light of these new finds, I suspect that these divinations are somehow connected with the move from north of the Huan River to the Xiaotun site. That a settlement which required Di's sanction was called "celestial" is further evidence of Di's relationship with the sky. I am not suggesting here that da and tian ^ were ever homophones, but that the oracle bone character originally had two readings. Addi tional evidence that the graph ^ was sometimes read as tian is found in inscriptions which concern weather. Qi @ means that the sky is clear, as opposed to rainy or cloudy. A number of inscriptions include the expression daqi ^cl?.84 What "greatly clear" would mean, as opposed to simply "clear" is not obvious. However, if da is read as tian, the expres sion is tian qi "the sky will be clear." The alternative to "clearing" in oracle bone divination is yu M "rain." We also find the expression da yw While "it will greatly rain" makes sense, the conventional way of saying "it will rain" in Classical Chinese is tian yu , i.e., "the sky will rain." If my hypothesis here is correct, then the addition at the top of the graph of two lines or a square, when the reading should be tian, was probably a means of graphically differentiating the character from da. In any case, Creel's argument has inherent problems. It is certainly conceivable that a word meaning "sky" might not occur in the oracle 80. Heji, 36535, 36544, Yingcang, 2529. 81. Heji, 36422. 82.

Keightley also discusses the identification of "this settlement" with the finds at Xiaotun. 84.

Oracle bone divination was primarily concerned with making the appropriate offerings to specific spirits. It is also concerned with determining that the spirits will not cause the Shang harm, but bless their various ventures. Thus, it has a limited vocabulary related to its purposes. However, the Shang must have had a word for "sky." If that word was not tian, then what was it? Given the continuity of the language and script between the Shang and the Zhou, it is unlikely that such a common word would have been lost altogether at the beginning of the Zhou. Moreover, to my knowledge, there is no alternative word meaning sky in Zhou bronze inscriptions and received texts. Thus, since there is continuity between the oracle bone graph for tian and later one meaning "sky," we may reasonably assume that tian was also the Shang word for sky. In sum, tian did mean "sky" as a natural phenomenon in Shang Dynasty inscriptions. Moreover, sky was the location of Shang Di. The great settlement which became the last Shang capital at Yinxu was sanctioned by Di and could be called the "celestial settlement." There were undoubtedly other contexts in which the Shang referred to the sky, but they are beyond the narrow range of topics covered by oracle bone divination. The Western Zhou Because the nature of the source material for the Shang and the Zhou is so very different, the extent of continuity between the two peoples is often difficult to determine. The primary contemporaneous written source for the Shang Dynasty is oracle bone inscriptions; that for the Western Zhou is bronze inscriptions. Whereas oracle bone inscriptions are divinations concerned with ensuring that the appropriate ritual ceremonies are conducted and with forestalling disasters, inscribed bronze vessels are ancestral dedications. Until the very last period of the Shang Dynasty, bronze inscriptions were very brief, but many Zhou vessels have lengthy inscriptions. These usually record the circumstances which merited the casting of the vessel and often describe important rites in which the caster participated. Thus, whereas the oracle bone inscriptions are isolated sentences written in the contexts of divination, bronze inscriptions tend to be historical and include an element of nar rative. There is a certain amount of received literature from the Western Zhou, including some chapters of the Shang shu pa] , some sections of the Shi jing, and the hexagram lines of the Yi jing JPj |1, that dates to the Western Zhou. Although the texts must always be used with caution, this received tradition provides a fuller context for the Zhou inscriptions than we have for the Shang.</page><page sequence="30">30 SHANG DI il'fjf AND TIAN MING Jzmi In making the argument that Tian was a Zhou god not worshipped by the Shang, Guo Moruo and Creel observed that tian was not the object of sacrifice in Shang inscriptions. However, sacrifices to tian are also absent from Western Zhou bronze inscriptions. Since oracle divinations were primarily concerned with the performance of rites to specific deities and ensuring the sanction of the spirits for royal actions, the contexts in which the sky might be mentioned are limited. In Zhou bronze inscriptions, however, the sky occurs as the place where Shang Di and the ancestors were found. Thus, the sky (tian) became a euphemism for Shang Di, much as "heaven" is for "God" to us. My hypothesis herein is that Shang Di, as the pole star, was the supreme spirit who gave the command or mandate to the Zhou. As I shall discuss below, the primary difference between the Shang and the Zhou was not the name of their high spirit, but that the Shang classified their ances tors by the ten suns, whereas the Zhou ancestors were identified with stars. The celestial mandate was originally a celestial configuration or astronomical event during the reign of King Wen, which was used by his son, King Wu, to legitimize his conquest. While this event could have been a conjunction of the five planets, as recorded in the new text Bamboo Annals, Western Zhou texts do not give us any indication of its nature.85 This astronomical event gave rise to the theory of tian ming, the changing "mandate of heaven," associated with a dynastic cycle. Let us now look at the role of Shang Di and tian in early Western Zhou bronze inscriptions. Shang Di and the Zhou Ancestors Two inscriptions from the early Western Zhou period mention "Shang Di." They are the Tianwang gui 5c t Wt and the Xing Hou gui ){£ S. In both inscriptions, Shang Di is a supreme authority, located above, i.e., in the sky, as he was in the oracle bones. The Tianwang gui is a very early Western Zhou vessel, probably dating to the reign of the conqueror King Wu. Tianwang, the caster of the vessel, describes how he served the king in performing a ritual of accession before recording the reward he received from King Wu: 85. Zhushu jinianyizhu If ed.

That the announcement to Shang Di was made in the "Sky Chamber" (tianshi JOb_ ) presumably reflects Shang Di's loca tion in the sky, where he was accompanied by King Wu's father, King Wen, who looked down upon him. Lin Yun fr/ll has argued that the "Sky Chamber" was located at Songshan Si ill and that this sacrifice was made by King Wu on his return to Zhou after the defeat of the Shang at Mu Ye -ftIT'.87 Songshan was the Central Peak (zhongyue Sj) in five phase cosmology and I argued in The Shape of the Turtle that it was the Peak (i/ue |5) that received sacrifices as in oracle bone inscriptions and an axis mundi in Eliade's sense of a place where heaven and earth meet at the center of the world.88 According to this inscription, King Wu performed a xi U-rite to Shang Di. As we have already seen, there is little, if any, evidence of direct offerings to Shang Di in oracle bone inscriptions, but the Ersi Ge Qi you, a late Shang Dynasty bronze vessel, records a rite performed to Shang Di by the last Shang king, Zhou Xin, in his second year. According to the Shi ji, the Shang were allowed to continue their ancestral rites after Weizi Qi was enfeoffed with the state of Song, so the Yin (i.e., Shang) rites that were cut off by King Wu must have been those to Shang Di, rather than to their own ancestors. We know little about the xi -rite. However, one of the hymns attributed to the Shang descendants ("Shang song" in the Shi jing commemorates the presentation of a great xi fg-rite by Tang M, traditionally regarded as their dynastic founder.89 Since the Tianwang gui inscription also records that King Wu cut off the Shang rites, King Wu's performance of the xz'-rite to Shang Di probably served as a claim to Di's approval and thus his right to rule the Shang people.

For example, the Shi Qiang pan jfeijSii, from the Middle Western Zhou period, states that, "Shang Di sent down perfect virtue and a large coterie [of supporting ministers]" If Shang Di was the pole star and he was accompanied by the Zhou ancestors, then we may logically surmise that the Zhou ancestors were also stars.

This myth is first recorded in the "Da ya" section of the Shijing, probably composed in the middle Western Zhou period. Just as the first ancestor of the Shang was impregnated by a black bird sent by Di, Hou Ji's mother was miraculously impregnated after she stepped on the big toe in Di's footprint. According to the Shi jing, Hou Ji was protected by Shang Di, though his mother exposed him to the elements three times, in a lane, a forest, and on cold ice.

The imagery here suggests that they were stars. Very similar language, in which the Zhou founding kings shine brightly in the sky, is found in the "Da ya" section of the Shi jing:95 - mmn - ^ np^(ZE)fiTf ' ' -SEfftiiii ° King Wen is above, how brightly he shines in the sky. Though Zhou is an old state, its mandate is new. The Zhou are greatly illustrious; Di's command (di ming) is greatly timely. King Wen ascends and descends; he is to the left and right of (assists) Di... The description of King Wen as shining above clearly suggests a star. There is more specific evidence for the idea that the ancestors were visible as stars in the later textual tradition. The reference to Shang Di and the hundred spirits in the Hu zhong recalls a line from the Warring States text, the Heguanzi HHE-p, in which the pole star is called the "Great One" Tai Yi : "The center is the position of the Great One; the hundred spirits (bai sheit WW) look up to it."96 This in turn recalls one from the Lun yu fit in: "To govern by means of de (virtue) is like the North Star (bei chen 4LM) dwelling in its place as the multitude of stars pay court to it."97 Although these lines are late, they suggest a continu ing tradition in which the ancestral spirits were stars in the court of the pole star. By this hypothesis, I do not mean to imply that King Wen was identi fied with a specific star that appeared in the early Western Zhou sky when he died, but that the stars in general were taken as ancestral spirits. New stars appear only rarely and it is difficult to imagine that a recently deceased ruler, however important, could have been identified with a new star. However, at least in later times, Hou Ji, the ancestor of the Zhou lineage was identified with a constellation.98 Although there are no pre-Han records of Hou Ji as a constellation, since Hou Ji was the progenitor of the Zhou people, the name is more likely to have been that 95- Mao shi buzheng, 19.1222 ("Da ya," "Wen Wang zhi shi," ft"/ "Wen Wang" 96.

Possibly, this constellation was the celestial home of all the Zhou ancestors after they died. If Shang Di as the pole star commanded the sky (the home of the ances tral spirits), then, when he gave the mandate to the Zhou, it would makes sense for him to have demonstrated his command in the sky. In other words, the celestial mandate (tian ming) given to King Wen can best be understood as a celestial configuration or astronomical event taken as a manifestation commanded by Shang Di. Indeed, the other early Western Zhou inscription that mentions Shang Di, the Xing Hou gui ifUS, also mentions a "command" or "mandate" given to the Zhou. The context of the following passage from the Xing Hou gui is a royal "command" or "mandate" and gift of office and people to the Marquis of Xing JfPg.

I will pursue my filial duties to the ancestors, and not dare to be remiss. To fulfill my gratitude for such generosity, I will serve the celestial child. In order to record his majesty's command, I make this vessel for (my ancestor) the Duke of Zhou." The punctuation of the inscription is uncertain. I have punctuated after "above and below," but many scholars take this term as modifying di. It is unclear what the expression shang xia di JiT^r would mean here and various explanations have been given.

Another is that the xia di were ancestral spirits of the Zhou who were under Shang Di's aegis. Attractive as these explanations are, since there is no other evidence for the expression xia di, it seems more reasonable to read the characters as ending the previous clause.101 That Di might "bring an end" (dong read as zhong $§) to the mandate recalls the Shang oracle bone divinations discussed above in which Di might "bring an end" to the great settlement Shang.

Similarly, the expression xia di does not occur.</page><page sequence="38">38 SHANG DI _h-rf5 AND TIAN MING inscription, the parallel between the royal mandate given to Xing Hou, who had the vessel cast, and the celestial mandate given to the Zhou, is implicit. Moreover, this inscription makes clear that Shang Di's approval could not be taken for granted and that he might end the mandate of the Zhou. The nature of the celestial configuration or astronomical event during the reign of King Wen is not clearly stated in the inscriptions. It might have been a very unusual event, such as the conjunction of five planets in the 32nd year of the last Shang king, Zhou Xin, mentioned in the new text Bamboo Annals, which modern scholars have used to date the end of the Shang Dynasty.102 However, these records do not predate the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-222 b.c.e.) and it is also possible that it was a rare comet or a unique occurrence, such as a particularly spectacular stellar outburst (nova), meteor, or even a supernova. These would have been especially convincing if they occurred in the region of the constellation associated with the Zhou ancestor Hou Ji. However, we have no means of verifying such an event, so the nature of the celestial configuration cannot be determined. The Celestial Mandate All Western Zhou inscriptions and received texts agree that the celestial mandate was given to King Wen. No text ever states that it was given to his son Wu, the ruler who, they agree, actually overthrew the last Shang king, Zhou Xin. This suggests that the celestial mandate was originally a reference to a particular event seen in the sky in the time of King Wen and that King Wu interpreted this event as a supernatural sign, which estab lished his legitimacy as a ruler after he had conquered the Shang. Thus, it became the defining event of the conquest and at some point—when is not clear—it was taken as a part of a pattern in a dynastic cycle. We saw above that Shang Di commanded a celestial court in Shang times. The verb ling ^ ("to command"), and the noun, ming pff ("com mand" or "mandate"), only began to be distinguished graphically during the course of the Western Zhou period. The meanings are in any case closely related, as are the English words used to translate them, i.e., a person who is "commanded" may then have a "mandate." Significantly, the purpose of many Zhou bronze inscriptions was to record a "man date" {ming) which the Zhou king had given to the person for whom the bronze vessel was cast, or to commemorate or confirm an earlier mandate. There is a conceptual parallel between the mandate given to the Zhou founder and those given by the Zhou king to his lords. Thus, initially, 102.

Wang Guowei 3E.[Sff (Taipei: Shijie, 1957), shu shang, 37.</page><page sequence="39">SARAH ALLAN 39 Di's mandate may have been understood as a more exalted version of the commissions given by the king to his ministers; that is, King Wu claimed that a sign in the sky meant that Di had given the commission to rule all-under-the sky, previously held by the Shang rulers, to his father. Since the Shang already had a myth of a previous people whom their ancestors had conquered, this assertion then led to the concept of a dynastic cycle in which the Zhou defeat of the Shang was seen as a repetition of the Shang defeat of a previous dynasty References to tian in Western Zhou bronze inscriptions, other than as a personal name, occur to two, quite specific, contexts: (1) the celestial mandate received by King Wen and (2) the title tianzi These reflect the key to understanding the role of sky/heaven. The Tianwang gui and the Xing Hou gui discussed above refer to Shang Di as giving sanction to the Zhou kings. In the Xing Hou gui, that sanction took the form of a command (ling). The sky (tian) is described as the venue of this command in the inscription on another early Western Zhou bronze inscription, the Da Yu ding The condemnation of the last Shang kings found in the Da Yu ding inscription is coherent with the account found in the "Jiu gao" Sip chapter of the Shang shu jnj#. In both, the Shang ruler is accused of losing the mandate because of the drunkenness and unbridled behavior in his court.

Indeed, no Western Zhou inscription ever mentions the Xia, or refers to the Shang conquest of an earlier dynasty. Although there is an association between the command or mandate and the sky in the Da Yu ding inscription, tian appears to be a natural phenomenon, not an anthropomorphic spirit. Thus, the reference to the 103. Yin Zhou jinwen jicheng, 5.2837, Jinwen zongji, 2.1328; Shang Zhou qingtongqi mingwen xuan, 1.62.</page><page sequence="41">SARAH ALLAN 41 sky may be understood straightforwardly as the provenance of the com mand and the home of the spiritual bodies. Significantly, the phrase for the mandate "received" by King Wen in this inscription is not tian ming, but tian you da ling (ming) ^ W(mi), so the sky should be the place of the command or mandate, not the subject which gives the command.104 I understand this to mean that he received the omen configured in the sky from Shang Di. In another early Western Zhou bronze inscription, on the He zun M Ht, the sky is described as the source of King Wen's fortune. The vessel is damaged at a critical point. Most scholars provide da ling i\ji, "great command" for the two missing characters, and I have followed this interpretation.

King Wen received this [great command]. King Wu conquered the great city Shang. Then he made a courtyard (ting) announcement to the sky (tian), saying, I shall reside in this central city,.. ,105 Tian, as I understand it here, is the place where Di and the ancestral spirits dwelled, rather than a deity. That the announcement was made in the courtyard, an uncovered space, may be significant. By announcing to the sky—the place where the omen that was seen in the time of King Wen—that he will dwell in the center and rule from there, the king is requesting the sanction of Shang Di. The idea that King Wen received a celestial command is also found in the early chapters of the Shang shu. There, the mandate is described both 104.

Thus, Di's command or mandate could be called "celestial" or, to use the English 106.

See Bernhard Karlgren, The Book of Documents (Stockholm: Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1950), 34, lines 9 and 13, 60, line 3 (shang di ming); 34, line 1, 38, line 3; 47, line 17, 50, line 14 (tian ming). However, the context of Shang Di's command is usually one with references to tian and tian ming occurs in contexts that also refer to Di or Shang Di. 107.

According to the "Shao gao" Q fp chapter of the Shang shu: ' Miff* ' Shang Di in the resplendent sky altered his principal son (i.e., heir apparent) arid the mandate of this great state Yin. Now it is the king who has received the mandate, unbounded in its grace.108 This line provides a key to the meaning of the term tianzi in the Western Zhou. In both the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, rulers were called, wang ZE ("king"). The term tianzi, which I have translated above as "celestial child" rather than the more conventional "son-of-heaven," is used from the beginning of the Western Zhou in bronze inscriptions as an honorific, a polite form of reference by the caster of the vessel for the king. The Zhou nobility sometimes referred to themselves humbly as "small child" (xiaozi /J n ) in both inscriptions and the received literature, presumably referring to their position as the child of their ancestors' lineage.109 In Zhou bronze inscriptions, the caster has usually received a "mandate" to undertake an official position from the Zhou ruler. Thus, there is an implicit parallel between the official and the ruler. By calling the king tianzi, the caster acknowledges that the Zhou king was the "child" who had received a celestial mandate, an actual command seen in the sky analogous to that which he himself received. Although the term tianzi is not found in oracle bone inscriptions, we cannot be certain that it was not used by the court. In any case, the use of the term tianzi by the Zhou kings was a political claim of legitimacy. The Western Zhou lasted for a period of some four hundred years. During this period, the concept of tian ming developed from a specific astronomical event during the reign of King Wen, which supported the Zhou claim of legitimacy, to the idea of a changing mandate of heaven, closely associated with a theory of dynastic cycle. Since Shang Di ruled the sky, it was he who gave the command, demonstrating his intention in the sky. Since the mandate was displayed in the sky, it could also be described as a "celestial" or "heavenly" mandate (tian ming). As time passed, this gradually became more abstracted into a cosmological theory in which the "sky's command" or, as it is usually translated, the "mandate of heaven," became a more abstract idea. Moreover, it was interpreted as part of a repeating cycle. This was the origin of the idea of a changing mandate of heaven. 108. Karlgren, The Book of Documents, 47, line 9 (my translation). 109.

Graphic examples that are too fragmentary or too damaged to classify, or which are unclear in the published rubbings, have been omitted from the tables below. Variants that are only found on a single fragment in this corpus are also omitted on the grounds that they are likely be idiosyncratic variations and therefore are not significant in establishing a pattern. Thus, these tables are not a complete list of oc currences. Ambiguous examples are classified as they appear to us in the rubbings, but are marked in italics. Table 1 lists occurrences of the standard graph for di 'iff. It is taken as "standard" for this graph because it is much more common than any other graphic form. Although it is used predominantly in contexts where the reading is di (Shang Di or an ancestral title), in some examples the reading should be ^0. Both are included in the listed examples. Table 2 lists usages of a graph which is used for both di ffV and di '{iff. It is noteworthy, however, all but one of the examples in which it stands for di 'Sr (862,14148, 30391) give the appearance of carelessness, leaving only a unique example; thus, it is possible that this form of the character is really the same as that listed in Table 1. Table 3 includes examples in which the graph should be read as di fff. It is possible that form (c) is a personal name. A further form, ^ (Heji 17072,, 22450), sometimes understood as di ff?, is omitted on the grounds that it is probably a personal name. Table 4(a) is the standard graphic form for the di rite. As such, it may be considered the equivalent of the graph listed in Table 1. The variant 4(b) is probably simply calligraphic and it is not always possible to distinguish it from 4(a). 4(c) is simply an upside down version of this variant. 4(e) is probably simply a careless version of 4(d)—the two forms appear in the same inscription (Heji 34145). 4(f) and 4(g) represent words that function as rites, and they may be joined characters, rather than simple variants.
