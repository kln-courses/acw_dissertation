<plain_text><page sequence="1">William J. Berg, Michel Grimaud, and George Moskos, Saint/Oedipus: Psychocritical Approaches to Flaubert's Art. With an essay by Jean-Paul Sartre and a new translation of Flaubert's Saint Julian by Michel Gri- maud. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1982. 305 pages. This book may be hailed as that rare bird among published works of literary criticism: a) a collection of articles that is effectively cohesive, de- spite the range of approaches utilized by the individual authors; b) a collective effort that actually focuses on a single work in such a way as to reveal extensive cooperation and planning on the part of its creators; c) a truly interdisciplinary project. Saint/Oedipus has been carefully conceived as a useful and thought-provoking work of criticism for an audience in- cluding both specialist and non-specialist readers of Flaubert-as of French studies and literary theory as well. The reader is immediately struck by another original aspect of this book. The object it proposes to examine is neither the Flaubert corpus, nor a novel within that corpus, but a fragmentary-and yet self-contained- portion of the Trois contes: its opalescent heart, La Legende de Saint Julien l'Hospitalier. The authors have perhaps invented a new genre of collected literary criticism by focusing on a twenty-page short story-a micro cosm of sorts-within a psychocritical framework; the only other book devoted exclusively to Saint Julian concerns its legendary and esthetic sources. The structure and scope of Saint/Oedipus is worthy of some detailed attention. In his preface to the book, Berg comments on certain choices made by the authors/editors. He begins by stressing the importance of Charles Mauron's "psychocriticism"; he explains that the first three essays in Part One (by Berg, Grimaud, and Moskos) discuss "the recurrent patterns yielded by Saint Julian without undue imposition and interpretation by the critic" (p. 8). Berg stresses the importance of the psychological point of view, thus describing the first three essays as "Freudian, Jungian, Kohu- tian" (p.9). This plurality is in fact much more controversial than it might appear at first glance-as are the dimensions of psychoanalysis itself, here construed as being identical with the terrain of psychology. The projected plurality is counterpointed by the exclusion of Lacan (described by the author as "notably absent, particularly in a book dealing with a French text" [p. 10]), justified, here, by the book's focus as "a framework for any</page><page sequence="2">1268 REVIEWS psychological approach to textual analysis" (p. 80). The point of departure for the project is the Oedipal parallel in Flaubert's story of ritual parricide. The first essay is a study of displacement and reversal in the text. Berg notes a rhetorical relation between the roles played by the stag and the father: the question of Julian's motivations for murdering his parents is brought into relief through a discussion of possible reading strategies. Berg seems to be somewhat critical of psychoanalytical criticism (although he allows for some exceptions, such as the work of Norman Holland), and he resolves the question in favor of a reading centered in psychology, or "psychological motivation" (p. 37). Within this framework, he formulates a reading of Julian's struggle with figures of power-on the one hand, the parents, initially superior and later killed, in a duplication and reversal of Julian's original context, and on the other, the animals, whose very vulnerability (inferiority) ultimately masters Julian and condemns him to become a parricide. The last section of Berg's article includes a discussion of the role of the narrator-a particularly mysterious element of Flau- bert's story. The second essay proposes the "individuation process" as its object of study. Moskos takes as his starting-point the Jungian concept of individ- uation as "the integration of the personality" (p. 70), catalyzed by Jung's collective unconscious. His reading focuses on the characterization of Ju- lian's psychological progression, specifically as concerns his role in the "family unit," the effects of the presence and absence of the parents, and Julian's strategy of violence as it vacillates between regression and devel- opment. Moskos describes the atmosphere of dreams as it affects the con- tent of the story, i.e., the myth of the hero (and the hero's "progress of conscious development" [p. 108]) as exemplified by Julian. He discovers and analyzes a three-part movement in Julian's individuation. The final section of the article explicates the role of the leper in terms of the familial context of the story, and particularly as regards the paternal image and the murder: Moskos concludes that the final dramatic moment of Flau- bert's narrative restores the original innocence of Julian the child (p. 128). The essay by Michel Grimaud appears, both literally and metaphori- cally, at the center of the volume. Entitled "A 'Ferocious Heart': Love and Parricide in Saint Julian," it examines a series of questions crucial to the interpretation of the story. Grimaud begins by reflecting on the meaning of the epithet applied to Julian by the anthropomorphic stag; Julian's relation to society can only be understood in terms of the latter's institu- tionalized cruelty (p. 131). In turn, this contextualization of Flaubert's character leads the critic toward a series of ambivalent notations (p. 134) that operate on thematic and semantic levels (as well as on a stylistic level, demonstrated by Grimaud later in the essay). This ambivalence is struc- tured according to the terms of religion and aggression that permeate the atmosphere of the text; its "denial of affect," (p. 139-ff.), particularly concerning love and sexuality, leads back to the role of religion. Gririaud</page><page sequence="3">M L N 1269 analyses a moral duality (p. 145), partially codified in the pagan/Christian opposition, in which Julian alone can circulate. The series of structural oppositions and reversals culminates in the final scene of Saint Julian. Flaubert's enigmatic conclusion brings out the question of narrative voice, discussed here through an analysis of direct speech. The authors include a section of volume 2 of Sartre's L'Idiot de lafamille, here translated into English for the first time. In these pages, Sartre dis- cusses the relation between Flaubert himself and his character, Julian. Although the other essays in the volume deliberately avoid questions of "psychobiography," Sartre's presence in this volume is not the least of its attractions. The importance of these pages for the reader unable to ap- proach Sartre's original text can hardly be over-estimated. And as a psy- chologically-oriented reading, Sartre's excerpt gives rise to some new ques- tions when read in the context of these essays. Grimaud concludes the first section of the book with a general discus- sion of the issues involved in the essays. He sums up the critical approach to psychology and poetics in terms of the "phases of self development," the Kohutian alternative to what must ultimately be considered in non- psychological terms -the Oedipal structure. Part Two of the book includes Grimaud's translation of SaintJulian-a most faithful rendering that allows the translucent, allegorical beauty of Flaubert's language to slip into the folds of English. Grimaud's essay on poetics and translation follows it as a kind of text-book for the translator, including an extremely interesting study of stylistic elements of Flaubert's text: punctuation and linking practices, logical connectives, adverbs, par- ataxis, clause structure, and verb tense. The author compares several translations of SaintJulian, and his concluding arguments would be well taken by any translator of French prose into English. The third section of SaintlOedipus is an extensive bibliography of psychoanalysis (intended to complement previous surveys published in Sub-Stance), with emphasis on French studies.
