Procreation Images in Job 38:28-29 GREGORY VALL Notre Dame Seminary New Orleans, LA 70118 In job 38:28-29, we find four procreation images in a series of four ques- tions.1 These questions concern the origin of certain natural forms of water. Does the rain have a father? Or who begot the dew drops?2 1 G. Bickell (in 1892) deleted v 28 as "a tautologous and prosaic imitation of v 29," and Bernhard Duhm (in 1897) argued for the same deletion on the basis of strophic structure; see both opinions apud Karl Budde, Das Buch Hiob (HKAT 2/ 1; 2d ed.; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1913) 245. For the same two reasons the verse is regarded as a gloss by some twentieth-century commentators (e.g., Ramir Auge, Job [La Biblia: Versió dels textos originals i comentan 9; Montserrat: Monestir de Montserrat, 1959] 329; Georg Fohrer, Das Buch Hiob [KAT 16; Gütersloh: Mohn, 1963] 492; A. de Wilde, Das Buch Hiob [OTS 22; Leiden: Brill, 1981] 365). Samuel Terrien (Job [CAT 13; Neuchâtel: Delachaux &amp; Niestlé, 1963] 251) retains v 28 but deletes w 29-30, explaining that they were added to complete the catalogue of meteoro- logical phenomena. Edouard Dhorme (A Commentary on the Book of Job [London: Nelson, 1967] 588) demonstrates that vv 28 and 29 are "inseparable" and concludes that "it is quite arbitrary to eliminate either." Finally, Pio Fedrizzi ( Giobbe [La Sacra Bibbia; Rome/ Turin: Marietti, 1972] 263) also defends the unity of vv 28-29 but suspects that v 30 is a gloss, on account of its being "prosaic." The following analysis should indicate that the questions in vv 28-29 are not merely repetitious, and since commentators disagree on what is "prosaic" and on the strophic structure of Job 38, arguments for deleting one or more verses on such grounds must be regarded as dubious. Hebrew Deglê is hapax legomenon, and the meaning "drops" is based on the context and the ancient versions (Vg, Targum, Syriac). An etymology based on Arabic J ajala ("confine, 504</page><page sequence="2">PROCREATION IMAGES IN JOB 38:28-29 505 From whose womb did the ice come forth? And the rime from the sky - who gave birth to it? Some commentators give us what they consider to be the gist of the passage. For example, Francis I. Andersen asserts that "the sole point to be taken is that the Lord made them all."3 But few commentators engage the text in a rhetorical analysis in order to discern the answers which the four questions anticipate, and those who do so fail to bring grammatical considera- tions to bear on their analysis. Thus, there is no consensus on what the correct answers to these questions are. From whose womb did the ice come forth? The following analysis of Job 38:28-29 (1) will describe its parallelism and structure, (2) will discuss its mythological background, (3) will survey the various answers to the four questions that have been proposed by twen- tieth-century commentators, (4) will give a rhetorical analysis that is based in part on a crucial (and hitherto unrecognized) syntactical feature, and (5) will demonstrate that this passage probes more deeply into the theology of creation than Andersen's "sole point" suggests.4 I. Parallelism and Structure The two lines of poetry in Job 38:28-29 feature a tight structure, based on both intralinear and interlinear parallelism.5 Each of the four cola men- tions one form of water. In the first line, rain and dew, both of which form drops, stand in intralinear parallelism. This pair of unfrozen forms of water stands in interlinear parallelism with the pair of frozen forms, ice and rime, in the second line. Moreover, there is a special affinity between dew drops and rime, which stand in the respective b cola, in that they both appear mysteriously out of the atmosphere overnight. Turning to the procreation terms, we find that the intralinear parallelism is based on a correspondence restrain; gather, collect") is plausible, though by no means certain (see S. R. Driver and G. B. Gray, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Book of Job [2 vols.; ICC; Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1921] 2. 305). J. T. Milik ("Giobbe 38,28 in siro-palestinese e la dea ugaritica Pdry bt ar," RivB 6 [1958] 254), citing the same Arabic root, suggests that &gt;eglê means "layers (or clouds)," but his argument is not convincing. 3 Francis I. Andersen, Job: An Introduction and Commentary (London: InterVarsity, 1976) 278. 4 The present article is an extensively revised and expanded version of the discussion of Job 38:28-29 found in Gregory Vail, From Womb to Tomb : Poetic Imagery and the Book of Job (Ph.D. diss., Catholic University of America, 1993; available from University Microfilms Inter- national, Ann Arbor, MI) 220-24. 5 Robert Alter ( The Art of Biblical Poetry [New York: Basic Books, 1985] 101) describes this structure in its broad lines.</page><page sequence="3">506 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 57, 1995 of gender to reproductive function , while the interlinear parallelism is based on gender and reproductive complementarity :6 These features of parallelism may be illustrated as follows: 28. (a) Does the rain have a father? male partner ("father") (b) Or who begot the dew drops? male function ("begot") 29. (a) From whose womb did the female partner ice come forth? ("whose womb") ( b ) And the rime from the sky - female function who gave birth to it? ("gave birth") According to Norman Habel, this complex of procreation images is employed in order to "express mysterious origin,"7 but what precisely is the text telling us about the mysterious origin of the rain, dew, ice, and hoarfrost? The next step toward answering this question is to examine the text's mytho- logical background. II. Mythological Background According to Luis Alonso Schökel, the images in Job 38:28-29 constitute the most conspicuous vestige in the OT of a myth in which "the sky is the masculine element, stretched out over the earth as the feminine element" and "the rain or the dew is the semen with which the paternal sky fertilizes the earth mother."8 In fact, however, the rain and dew in our text are not even considered for the role of semen. It is a question of their being brought to birth, not of their being an agent of impregnation (for which vv 26-27 and especially Isa 55:10 provide closer parallels). Nor has the poet taken care to align the male reproductive function with the sky and the female with the earth, for the fourth question asks what mother has "given birth" (qal oiyld) to the "rime of the sky " ( kěpor šamayim).9 If the myth (better: mythical 6 Auge (Job, 330) understands beten in v 29a to refer to the male reproductive organs ("[el] 'ventre' patern") and yälad in v 29b to refer to begetting rather than giving birth, but his argument is strained and arbitrary, requiring in part that one regard v 28 as a gloss on v 29 (cf. Dhorrne, Commentary, 588). One senses that Augé may be uncomfortable with the images of feminine procreation. 7 Norman Habel, The Book of Job: A Commentary (OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1985) 543. 8 Luis Alonso Schökel and J. L. Sicre Diaz, Job: Comentario teológico y literario (Madrid: Cristiandad, 1983) 560. Henceforth, this work will be cited as Alonso Schökel, Comentario. It may be that the poet has purposely avoided such an alignment (cf. 17:14, where Job imagines calling the pit "my father" and the worms "my mother and my sister" - the opposite of what we might have expected).</page><page sequence="4">PROCREATION IMAGES IN JOB 38:28-29 507 schema) to which Alonso Schökel refers forms part of the background of our text, we must admit that it has been turned upside down and inside out.10 Since our text deals in part with precipitation and asks who is responsible for it, a more promising source of parallels can be found in the myths of Baal-Hadad, the great fertility and storm god of Canaan.1 1 In some Ugaritic texts "dew" (//) and "showers" ( rbb ) are found in parallelism (or in the same colon) and are together closely associated with Baal.12 There is also the name of one of Baal's "daughters,"13 tly bt rb, which may mean "Dew, daughter of Showers."14 Perhaps Job 38:28 is intended in part to refute the notion that Baal (or any corresponding deity, such as Tammuz or Adonis) is responsible for the rain and dew (cf. Jer 14:22). 15 III. Proposed Answers to the Four Questions Since our text is comprised of four questions, it seems that the key to interpreting it lies in arriving at the correct answers to these questions. Amazingly little attention is given to this endeavor in twentieth-century commentaries on the Book of Job. Several major commentaries do not 10 Alonso Schökel ( Comentario , 560) grants that the mythical "motif" has been "de- my thologized" ( desmitizado ) and that the "sky and earth do not figure as father and mother in the generative process" in this context; he also qualifies his claim that Job 38:28-29 contain "the most conspicuous trace of this myth in the OT" by saying that it is only "a faint trace, scarcely marked and drawn." But if the trace is so faint, how can one be certain one has identified the myth correctly? Might not the text be based on some other mythical schema or model? In ancient Egyptian mythology the earth is a god (Geb), and the sky a mother goddess (Nut); iconographically, the latter is frequently depicted as a naked woman arched over the earth or the entire cosmos (see Othmar Keel, The Symbolism of the Biblical World: Ancient Near Eastern Iconography and the Book of the Psalms [New York: Seabury, 1978] 31-41). On the identity and character of this deity and his cult, as they are reflected in biblical and extrabiblical texts, see John Day, "Baal (Deity)," ABD, 1. 545-49. 12 CTA 3.2.38-41; 3.4.86-88; 19.1.42-44 (cf. 40-41). The word banātu (see CTA 3. 1 .23) may, however, have the sense "women, wives," as the Hebrew cognate bãnôt occasionally does (e.g., in Prov 31:29). 14 CTA 3.1 .24-25; 3.3.4; 3.4.4; 3.5.50; 4. 1 . 1 8; 4.4.56; 4.6. 1 1 . In 5.5. 1 1 the first element of this name is anomalously spelled ttly, and, curiously, we find ///for tl in 19.4.200. Milik ("Giobbe 38,28," 252-54) discusses the meanings of the names of Baal's daughters and the meaning of the phrase &gt;eglê tāl in Job 38:28, but he does not propose a mythological connection between the goddess Pidray and the text from the Book of Job (contra Fedrizzi, Giobbe, 263, and Marvin Pope, Job [AB 15; 3d ed.; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1973] 299). The only real point of contact noted by Milik is that a Christian Palestinian Aramaic fragment of the Catecheses of Cyril of Jerusalem uses the phrase pdrwy dtP to translate PíòXouç ôpóaou (the Greek rendering of ^egle tal), and that pdrwy may be etymologically related to Ugaritic pdry (Milik only implies that). 15 See further section 5 below.</page><page sequence="5">508 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 57, 1995 actually take up the interpretation of the passage;16 those which do so do not arrive at a consensus. According to Moses Buttenwieser, the first question - "Does the rain have a father?" - should be answered affirmatively. He claims that in Arabia and in Scotland the wind is referred to as "the father of the rain."17 None of the more recent commentators accepts this suggestion, however. Karl Budde's comment that the origin of the rain, dew, ice, and rime "is designated as a riddle (Rätsel)" may suggest that the questions cannot be answered at all.18 Samuel Terrien, on the other hand, claims that the questions are "rhetorical,"19 which may suggest that the answers are self-evident.20 This would explain why Terrien does not feel it necessary to supply them. G. B. Gray's very brief comment on the passage, that "these things have no human source,"21 likewise avoids the issue of how, exactly, the questions are to be answered. Alonso Schökel notes that the questions "in principle" admit of two different sets of responses.22 The first set of responses would run as follows: "No, the rain has no father. No one begot the dew drops. The ice came forth from no one's womb. And no one gave birth to the rime of the sky." And the second set: "Yes, the rain has a father, God. The dew drops were begotten by God. The ice came forth from God's womb. And God gave birth to the rime of the sky." Alonso Schökel does not commit himself to either set of answers. He does mention, however, that Cajetan (1469-1534) accepted the first set of responses and that Pineda (1558-1637) argued for the second set, which led him into "an interesting disquisition on the 'maternity' of God."23 16 Their comments on these verses are concerned with issues such as the meaning of Deglê and the question whether one or both of the verses ought to be deleted as a gloss.

Rowley, Job (NCB; London: Nelson, 1970) 314-15; Fedrizzi, Giobbe, 263; Robert Gordis, The Book of Job: Commentary, New Translation and Special Studies (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1978) 449; de Wilde, Buch Hiob, 365. J. Gerald Janzen {Job [Interpretation; Atlanta: John Knox, 1985] 238) offers an interpretation of vv 22-38 as a whole, but he does not mention vv 28-29. 17 Moses Buttenwieser, The Book of Job (New York: Macmillan, 1922) 289. Buttenwieser also cites Prov 25:23, which reads, in part, "The north wind brings forth ( tèhôlêl ) rain." 18 Budde, Buch Hiob, 245. 19 Terrien, Job, 25 1 . 20 See n. 33 below.

The Dominican Cajetan (Tommaso de Vio) published his commentary on</page><page sequence="6">PROCREATION IMAGES IN JOB 38:28-29 509 Indeed, it should be noted that the second set of responses would imply both a certain paternity (v 28) and a certain maternity (v 29) on God's part. And there's the rub. Does the text invite us to compare God's creation of the rain, dew, ice, and frost with human procreation, or does it dissuade us from just such a comparison? The majority of commentators who take sides on this issue opt for the second set of responses, but they play down the procreation analogue by reminding us that the poet is using figurative language.24 However, at least one commentator who favors the second set of responses feels that the implications of the metaphors cannot be dismissed so easily. John C. L. Gibson finds the imagery in these lines daring. He feels that while most OT writers, because of possible pagan connotations, would avoid the notion that God is the father, much less the mother, of created things, "the author of the Book of Job is a poet, and here he prefers risky language to safe theology if it will help get his audience thinking."25 The crucial question, however, is this: Is the audience answering the questions correctly in the first place? In an article on the rhetoric of Yahweh in Job 38, Michael V. Fox accepts the first set of responses given above: the "understood answer" to the question Does the rain have a father? is No, of course not, and the answer to the question Who begat the dewdrops[?] is No one, yet they exist.26 Among major twentieth-century commentators, none explicitly adopts this interpretation, and only John E. Hartley seems to accept the first set of responses even implicitly. He writes: "Yahweh next asks Job how the rain , dew, ice, and frost originate, since they have no father or mother. . . . This picture discounts the pagan belief in the natural generation of these elements. Yahweh alone brings them forth."27 The first set of responses is also implicit in Robert Alter's exposition of our text. According to Alter, Yahweh's questions present "a sort of riddling paradox (no one is the father of the rain, but the rain is the father of life)."28 This comment at once recalls Budde's claim that the text designates the origin of the hydrous forms as a riddle and Alonso Schökel's claim that the text is the Book of Job in 1533. Juan de Pineda, a Jesuit biblical scholar, published a two-volume commentary on the Book of Job in Madrid in the years 1597-1601. See Franz Hesse, Hiob (Zürcher Bibelkommentare, AT 14; Zurich: Theologischer Ver- lag, 1978) 197; Edward J.

Alter, Art of Biblical Poetry, 101.</page><page sequence="7">510 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 57, 1995 ultimately based on a mythical identification of the rain as a masculine fructifying force. Alter seems to presume that the very juxtaposition of "rain" and "father" is enough to evoke the mythical schema, while the purposeful inversion of the schema - naming the rain as the procreated rather than the procreator - articulates a paradox. There remains yet one very original interpretation of Job 38:28-29. In his two-volume exegetical and theological study of Job, Jean Leveque makes two statements about this text. First he asserts of "the inanimate creatures" that "their formation is described here and there after the model of animal par- turition: the rain has a father, as do the drops of dew (38:28); the ice and the frost have known the maternal womb (v 29)."29 Clearly Leveque answers the first question affirmatively, and his comment presumes that some positive answer can be given also to the three who questions. Thus, he would no doubt reject the first set of answers outlined above. Lévêque's second comment on our text, however, indicates that he would not accept the second set of answers either. Were one to answer "God" to the three who questions in vv 28b-29, he claims, "the anthropomorphism, indeed the theriomorphism, would be much too violent."30 The sum of Lévêque's two statements is that the rain, dew, ice, and rime are brought into being in a way analogous to animal or human reproduction, but that God is not the parent referred to. This inter- pretation leaves one to ask: To whom might this "maternal womb" known by the ice and the frost belong, if not to God?31 IV. Rhetorical Analysis Thus far we have seen that those commentators who concern themselves with the interpretation of Job 38:28-29 treat the four questions, like the other questions in Yahweh's speeches, as rhetorical.32 This much we may grant, if by "rhetorical" we mean that Yahweh is not seeking information for his own benefit but is attempting to guide Job's train of thought along a particular course.33 This does not necessarily mean, however, that the answer to every 29 Jean Leveque, Job et son Dieu : Essai d'exégèse et de théologie biblique (2 vols.; EBib; Paris: Gabalda, 1970) 516. It is unclear why Leveque feels these images imply (or may imply?) animal parturition (cf. his use of the word thériomorphisme below). 30 Ibid., 519 n. 3. 31 The fact that the text speaks explicitly of "the rime of the sky " excludes Mother Earth from the picture, even though she has a place elsewhere in the Book of Job (see 1:21, and Vail, From Womb to Tomb, esp. chaps. 1 and 6). 32 Budde ( Buch Hiob, 245) may be the only exception. Richard A. Lanham ( A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms [2d ed.; Berkeley/ Los Angeles/ Oxford: University of California Press, 1991] 71) defines "erotesis," or the rhetorical question, as a question "which implies an answer but does not give or lead us to expect one." Chris Baldick</page><page sequence="8">PROCREATION IMAGES IN JOB 38:28-29 511 single question must be both obvious and simple. If that were the case, both Job and the reader would soon grow bored with Yahweh's rhetoric. On the other hand, if the speaker is to lead the listener purposefully along a course of thought primarily by means of questions, at least some of these questions ought to have self-evident answers; otherwise the listener will lose the train of thought.34 Now, since the four questions in Job 38:28-29 clearly hang together and demand a consistent set of responses, it seems likely that at least one of them - most likely the first - points to a self-evident answer. If this is so, Job has a guidepost for answering the remaining three questions. And if we can only recover the answer that was self-evident to Job, we too will benefit from that guidepost. At least two considerations immediately suggest that this hypothesis is on the right track. First, the first question in the series is of a form different from the three who questions which follow. While they admit of many possible responses, it must be answered either yes or no. Second, the implications of answering the first question "Yes, you, Yahweh, are the father of the rain" seem less serious (or as Gibson would have it, less "risky") than the implications of giving the answer "God" to the three who questions. It is not only the shift from masculine images in v 28 to feminine ones in v 29 that makes this so. While the first question is nominal (that is, verbless) in Hebrew and considers whether the noun "father" should be applied to Yahweh as the one who brings rain, the other three questions are verbal and contain graphic images. To call Yahweh "the father of the rain" is one thing; to speak of him begetting drops of dew or to speak of ice issuing from his womb is quite another.35 As we have noted above, none of the authors surveyed brings any grammatical considerations to bear on the rhetorical analysis of our text. Our {The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms [Oxford/ New York: Oxford University Press, 1991] 189) adds that the rhetorical question is "asked for the sake of persuasive effect rather than as a genuine request for information." Other dictionaries of literary terms supply very similar definitions (see C. Hugh Holman and William Harmon, A Handbook to Literature [6th ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1992] 407; Gero von Wilpert, Sachwörterbuch der Literatur [5th ed.; Stuttgart: Alfred Kroner, 1969] 643; A. F. Scott, Current Literary Terms: A Concise Dictionary of Their Origin and Use [London/ Melbourne/ Toronto: Macmillan; New York: St. Martin's, 1965] 246; M. H. Ābrams, A Glossary of Literary Terms [New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1957] 82). 4 When we look at Yahweh's speeches, we find that most of the questions have fairly obvious answers, but that a few (e.g. 38:19,24) would be impossible for Job to answer. 35 We note that while Leveque claims that to give the answer "God" to the three who questions would result in a violent anthropomorphism (or theriomorphism), he expresses no such concern about the first question. Presumably he would, nevertheless, not accept the answer "Yes, God" to the first question, if only for the sake of consistency.</page><page sequence="9">512 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 57, 1995 proposal is that one simple syntactical observation will enable us to arrive at a definitive answer to the first question (Does the rain have a father?), thus providing the interpretive key to the entire passage. This question begins with the Hebrew phrase hayěš, roughly equivalent to English "Is there?" or German "Gibt es?" There are five other rhetorical questions in the MT which begin with this phrase, and three of them are in the dialogue of the Book of Job (Job 5:1; 6:30; 25:3; Isa 44:8; Jer 14:22a).36 In all five texts the hayěš question clearly anticipates the answer no.37 Had the poet wished to have Yahweh ask a rhetorical question anticipating the answer yes, he would have used the phrase halõD, "Is there not?" This latter construction is very frequent in the Book of Job and throughout Biblical Hebrew literature (see BDB, 520a). Thus, the correct answer to the first question is No, the rain has no father. How then are the three who questions to be answered? In two of the five texts, mentioned above, containing a rhetorical hayěš question, the question is followed immediately by a rhetorical who question; and in both cases this who question anticipates the answer No one. Both of these texts, 5:1; 25:3, are in the dialogue of the Book of Job. This suggests that the three who questions in our text should be answered as follows: "No one begot the dew drops. The ice came forth from no one's womb. No one gave birth to the rime." This is the first set of answers mentioned by Alonso Schökel, the set accepted by Fox, Hartley, and Alter. V. Theological Conclusion If this analysis is correct, what is the point of the passage? To answer this question, we must return to our consideration of the text's mythological background. Baal and other deities were thought of as providing the pre- cipitation which is so essential for agriculture, and hence, for life itself. The first concern of Israelite theologians was to make it clear that Yahweh alone was responsible for bringing the rain. For example, in Jer 14:22 we read (note the rhetorical questions): Are there ( hayěš ) any rain bringers among the vanities of the nations? Or do the heavens themselves give showers? Is it not ( hâlõJ ) you, Yahweh, our God, for whom we wait?38 36 The remaining hayěš questions in the MT are nonrhetorical (i.e., are information- seeking) interrogations. 37 The sole rhetorical &gt;im yes question in the MT (Job 6:6) also anticipates the answer no. The same point is made elsewhere, of course (e.g., in 1 Kings 18).</page><page sequence="10">PROCREATION IMAGES IN JOB 38:28-29 513 While Job and his friends do not normally use the name Yahweh, they understand clearly that it is the one true God who gives the rain. For example, Eliphaz confesses that God is "the one who brings rain upon the face of the earth, who sends water on the surface of the fields" (Job 5:10; see also 12:15; 26:8; 28:25-26; 36:27-28). But here in Yahweh's speeches, the poet is taking this theology a step further. Not only is Yahweh alone responsible for the rain: he must no longer be spoken of in terms befitting a nature deity. Lévêque's interpretation of the passage is that the rain, dew, ice, and rime are brought into being in a way analogous to sexual reproduction, but that Yahweh is not the parent referred to. What we are suggesting is that the text means precisely the opposite: Yahweh is directly responsible for bringing about these forms of water (cf. the verses immediately preceding our passage, 38:25-27), but his mode of bringing them about has no true analogue in the realm of human (much less animal) procreation. This helps to explain the graphic, even bizarre, images in the three who questions. The poet shows that metaphors of sexual reproduction cannot do justice to God's creation of the hydrous forms. Hence the utter incongruity of ice coming forth from a womb. As Alter puts it, "Figurative language is used here to show the limits of figuration itself, which . . . means the limits of the human imagination."39 Viewed more positively, the procreation images in Job 38:28-29 point to the marvels of creation and to the wisdom and power of the Creator. The text focuses our attention on the diverse and remarkable forms which water takes in nature. Though water is notoriously unruly (Gen 49:4) and is impossible for a human to gather up, once it is spilled on the ground (2 Sam 14:14; see also Ps 22:15), Yahweh is able to gather the water into tiny, delicate beads of dew and to arrange them neatly over the surface of the earth. He is able to form slender crystals of rime and huge chunks of ice (see Sir 43: 19-20). As v 30 notes, he is even able to make the Great Deep freeze over. No procrea- tion analogue could adequately make reference to these deeds. 39 Alter, Art of Biblical Poetry, 101.</page></plain_text>
