<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAUSATION, ACTION, AND CREATION T HE study of causation comprehends an investigation of the logical problem: what is causation, of the psychological prob- lem as to the genesis of causation: where does the concept come from, and of the ontological problem as to the "objective" value of causal connection: does it "hold" in reality? The causal nexus seems an almost unique sort of connection, an almost mysterious relationship. Has this "relationship" any "simulacrum" at its bottom, some conscious or unconscious prototype? Is it succession, perhaps a special sort of "succession," or none at all? We feel however that it means "more" than succession, that mere succes- sion and causality are not interchangeable. But one thing seems to dawn upon us that whenever we say "cause" we think of some "genesis" of things, of a genetic relation as if the idea of "origin" or the symbol of origin would lie at the bottom of the idea of causality. Language offers some hints. We say that the cause "pro- duces" effects. The term "producing" should be stressed. It is rendered in German by the term "erzeugen" which has a sexual connotation. (Something is being "born.") But when we say "producing" we have always in mind a "producer," an "outside force," a living power which is apt to "produce" the change. We never "see" this force, we infer it. For instance: a pot of water stands on a gas stove. I turn the cock (first action), gas leaks out (effect), I light the gas (second action), the fire flames (effect), the water boils (effect of a previous agent "fire"). I infer that the water boils "because" of the heating force of fire, but I don't see the "because," this specific link termed "because"; I suppose so, I supply this link and in doing so I really invest the fire with a mysterious force; I consider the fire as a mystic power which is apt to make the water boil. What I am doing is really this: I in- vest the fire with the same power of action which I possess myself when I am "doing" something, pushing an armchair, for instance.</page><page sequence="2">492 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY The fire is just such a living agent as I am myself in every kind of action; in other words, this causal conception of the fire making the water boil is a projection of my own human personality on the fire or for that matter on everything conceived as a "cause" of some "change." We may equally assume that there is a "simile," an analogy, involved in this mental process, my human personality and the fire being the two objects of the simile. If I say that a body "falls," "because" it is heavy, I imply that heaviness or weight is a force apt to make the body fall. In other words I make a "personification" of that mysterious heavi- ness; the phrase would lose the specific flavor of "causal compul- sion" if it were conceived otherwise. It would merely signify a circumlocution (in form of a causal clause) of a simple classifica- tion, meaning: all heavy bodies fall, this is a heavy body too, so it falls as they all do (a single example of an allegedly general be- havior of bodies). If I say (as a physicist) that bodies fall "be- cause" they are attracted, I conceive "attraction" as an "acting agent," or as a hidden "goddess," as something human, a "pro- ducing" force, a paternal force. This is a "spiritual" conception investing the Earth with a power or a mystic "agens" producing effects or "changes." It is an animistic conception, brought about by projection of our own nature on "objects." All this presup- poses implicitly the conception of the universe as a conglomerate of acting powers or producing forces, which "give birth" to effects. The conception of cause may thus be described as the most general and ultimate form of panpsychism due to an act of projection. During a night when all was quiet and the room darkened, I heard suddenly a mysterious sound from within the locked up piano. I asked myself in awe: "Who" gave that sound? I looked for the "agent" who produced the sound. In so doing I thought "causally." I "understood" that somebody or something must have "caused" the sound. Being naturally "superstitious" I assumed at first that it was somebody, not something. A natur- ally superstitious being thinks just as causally as a scientific being, but it seeks the "causes" rather in "somebodies" instead of "somethings." The scientist "neutralizes" the "spirit" or the "ghost" without changing the substance of the matter. In the history of thinking we seek first the "somebodies" and afterwards the "somethings." But even neutralized this something remains the "author" (auctor), a "doer" and a "spirit." To be super- stitious means only conceiving events as acts and interpreting things as results of some hidden actions. Whoever expects "results" as a sequence of his actions, thinks causally. A primitive man raising his club to hit his opponent</page><page sequence="3">CAUSATION, ACTION, AND CREATION 493 thinks "causally," inferring that striking with the club will pro- duce certain effects desired. All transitive verbs imply causation, they imply "doing" some- thing, which "doing" always means causation, producing of effects. All transitive verbs are "causal predicates." As for the non- transitive verbs, their meaning is patterned after the model of the transitives, i.e., there is a "doing" perceptible in their meaning. "I sleep" implies a hidden but easily perceptible connotation "I do the sleeping"; there is something "active" in that verb. Thus "sleeping" is conceived as an enduring action. "The stream flows" is conceived in an analogous way, as if the stream (a mystical "stream") would do the flowing. The stream is equally conceived as a being engaged in a performance. Even the in- transitive verbs imply causation. Causation forms the pattern after which a living being con- ceives changes in the world which is seen as a system of "acts." Whatever happens is visualized as act of a living agent or author, as a doing. The very nature of the verb proves it, the verb mean- ing always action. And changes or happenings are always ex- pressed in the form of verbs. All events (or "changes," which means the same) are conceived as a system of actions deriving from authors. Authorships and creations make up the human universe. That system has left a "sediment" in speech, namely, the "verb" which always means "action." Cause points always to some "genesis" and everything is con- ceived as an act of "creation," as an "issue" of some "father," a maker. The pernicious microbes which "cause" the pulmonary ailment are the " parents " of a malicious " child, ' namely, the "ailment." Thus the idea of birth is superimposed on the idea of action as a second sheath of meaning. This is the second mental projection in the "causal" system. Parenthood, just as action (or perhaps better "aethood"), is the prototype of causation. That action which is expressed by the relationship of parent and child (parenthood and childhood) is one instance of action, but it is its most striking example, the foremost example of " authorship." But not only that action, every action is conceived as such an act of creation. There is always an "author" and the "work." It has been stressed that the characteristics of "certainty" and "universality" (Notwendigkeit und Allgemeinheit) encompass causality, which means that we must conceive changes causally and are unable to conceive them otherwise. I think that a tautology hidden at the bottom of the causal system will explain the mental fact of these characteristics. It consists in the fact that if we say " action," the seemingly "successive " result of action, namely,</page><page sequence="4">494 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the "effecting," is identical with the action itself; they are both only two facets of the same identical "act." By action I mean acting something or "doing something"; and if I do something I effect something. There must be the counterpart to the doing, the engramma on the "matrix," since action means leaving en- grammata on the matrix and nothing else ("passio" is the counter- part of every "actio"). The material of the cosmos carries like a matrix the "engrammata" of action but every single "move" is at the same time action and reaction or causing and effecting. The real meaning of the causal system would be that there is no act without acting and no product without producing. In other words, there is no real succession at all implied in the concept of causa- tion; the latter means acting which in turn means doing the act or producing the product. It is actually simultaneous, as I have explained. When we split (mentally) the phenomena into causes and ef- fects, we dissolve the world into an anthropomorphic system of actions or into subjects doing things. This twisting or splitting is expressed by the grammatical fact "sentence." The splitting of phenomena into causes and effects, the conceiving of the world as consisting of subjects doing things (objects) is merely an animistic pattern, the verb itself is the abode and refuge of causation since the meaning "doing" vibrates always in its innermost core. An "observer" of the empirical world will say that whenever a change occurs, somebody or something "makes" the change, namely, the one who is its author, in other words, the changing factor. But why do we imply such a changing factor? What does "change" really mean? Is that "somebody" who makes the change the "subject," or better, a subject, perhaps implied in the very concept of change? Not directly but by implication, for the following reasons: Thinking does not act by means of isolated de- tached "concepts" or notions; it proceeds dynamically by means of statements (sentences in grammar) (Urteite). "Change" (in its animistic transcript; action) is the most general pattern or frame- work within which the meaning of all transitive verbs may be placed, since every such verb means some change. But this is only a predicate and such predicate presupposes within the machinery of thinking always some subject, the verb itself having no proper existence of its own; it may claim an existence only within the framework of a statement or sentenee (Urteil und Satz). In other words the seeking for a "cause" would mean the seeking for a subject of a given statement or sentence, the latter being the gen- eral pattern of thinking. Since every fully-developed statement calls for a subject and would be incomplete, nay, senseless without</page><page sequence="5">CAUSATION, ACTION, AND CREATION 495 one, we always ask for the subject whenever we are confronted by the mere verb. Likewise we ask about the "cause" whenever we are faced by a "change," since cause and subject are identical. Since every verb implies causation and every statement presupposes a subject, we must seek the "cause." We could think non-causally only if we could think in non-statements (or non-sentences) or in sentences without subjects, which is impossible. The secret of the particular structure of causation is hidden in this very structure of the statement, this "vehicle" of our thinking which has a causal construction (whenever it states changes). Being always composed of a subject and a verb (in this instance), we must infer a subject and "ask" about it, if we are faced by a verb. The ever-haunting query about causes is thus revealed as the question about the "sub- ject" whenever the "verb" is given. It is the "longing" for the completion of the "-truncated" incomplete statement. Even in such sentences as "it thunders," the "it," though it is not a Jupiter, is a fully grown "soul." Whoever infers that "working" or "doing" must produce a "result" (no matter what result) is thinking causally. There is no action without results, since action itself means "producing results," acting being identical with effecting. "Result" means always the "thing done," and causality in its turn means that a "result," viz., the thing done, can only be achieved if it "is" done-which is true but tautological. Let us suppose that we introduce a hand into a paste. Every move of the hand will leave some mark in that paste, the acting and effecting being the same indivisible motion. The moving of the hand and the making of the mark are the same thing. We segregate, however, some aspects of the "act" as "causes" and some of them as "effects." In speech (even in scientific discourse) we sometimes skip over successive stages of causality, and that is why the identity of subject and cause is not always apparent. The statement "the horse draws the carriage," is undoubtedly causal. It means that the horse is drawing the carriage and the effect will be: the carriage moves on. So the reason why the car- riage changes its position is the action of the horse. Nevertheless there is no "succession" involved in that proposition. It does not mean that the horse draws and (afterwards) the carriage moves on. The drawing and the moving are the same thing, the moving is the being drawn. This sort of speech presents really two aspects of the same phenomenon. It is one act. If, on the other hand, a man should say that he is in New Jersey because his mother sent a horse and carriage for him, the mother is referred to as the cause of his displacement; but this turns out to be only a condensation</page><page sequence="6">496 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of a long range of intermediary statements or "causes" actually "omitted" as uninteresting. Mind acts here for reasons of mental economy as a " condenser." The real paradigm of causality, however, is embodied in one single act and in one single statement (Urteil). The old question about the origin of universality and certainty as attributes of causal connection would thus be accounted for by the very structure of the statement (sentence) itself and the inner meaning of the verb. Although the "effects" of an action may be manifold, the first effect lies in that very first stage of ac- tion and in what changes it accomplishes as action. Effect and action being simultaneous, the first effect of action lies inherently in the action itself. They are both aspects of the same event, they are seen as "action" or as "effect" according to the point of view or, better, from the angle they are looked upon. If the meaning of acting implies effecting as well, then the universality and certainty of the causal nexus would be of tautological origin. Our inability to imagine acting without effecting would account for these char- acteristics. Another line of thought might point to a similar result. We "know" that there is no "change" without cause. But does "change" really mean that "somebody" or "something" (that is the cause) must have affected it? Is that "somebody" or that "something" we infer without having "seen" them included in the plain notion of "change"? It seems that change is something impersonal, nonspiritual, independent of an additional "some- body." This is an illusion. "To change" is a transitive verb meaning action. The background of thought behind the verb "change" is the verb "to do," it means "do a change"; it is ac- tive and thus it means that whenever something is "done" there must be a "doer" who has done it. But "done" presupposes in itself a doer and so the causal nexus would be reduced to the fol- lowing: that whenever something is done there must be somebody who has done it. This is quite reasonable. Obviously the "thing done" must have been "done," that is, accomplished by a doer. (I seek the "activum" of a given "passivum.") But it is like- wise tautological. As a premise to our explanation of causality it is necessary to establish beyond doubt that verbs are causal predicates. Not only such transitive verbs as "to heat" (the stove "heats" the room), all verbs involving some action are causal since there is no action without its counterpart called effect. Even such verbs as "to save" (in "I save money") mean action and hence causation since the seemingly negative meaning of "I save" signifies in reality the exertion comprising the accumulation of money. The verb in the</page><page sequence="7">CAUSATION, ACTION, AND CREATION 497 phrase "I wear shoes" is equally active and causal; it means: I do wear shoes, I am supporting their load. "To read" is transi- tive (we must read "something") ; it is also causal, since it means action which must leave as such some, though not "visible," traces. If the time factor is apparent in a verb (as in "to kill") there is a clear indication that action is involved. Where this factor is but faintly hinted at, as in all verbs meaning sensory or mental ex- periences (touch, see, know, etc.), we shall be in doubt whether they really mean action and involve causality. If such a verb is convertible into a meaning designating timeless qualification or classification it can be ruled out as a nonverb (in terms of logic) and hence immaterial for the handling of our problem. Sometimes it may be (logically) both verb and non-verb, for instance: "I know mathematics " may have a connotation of action and be causal; it may, however, mean only: "I am a mathematician" and be a classification. "He sleeps now" may mean that he "takes rest," be causal and connote action or it may mean "he is at rest" and be non-causal descriptive of a status. In German " Ich heisse Johann" looks transitive, but it is only grammatically not logically transitive if it means "My name is John." All verbs (even the intransitive as "to flow" or "to sleep") are, however, modelled after the transitive causal verb; an undertone of action is in every verb; they may all be reduced to "doing," which is their under- lying mental background. The whole question loses, therefore, its acuteness. "Causalism" is a system by virtue of which we conceive events as actions because of the meaning of the verb and the sentence. The mystical and animistic veil of causality presupposes a uni- verse of affinities and power relations and creates the illusion of knowledge about the "nature" and even the "value" of things. Life, however, as a practical proposition would be hardly possible if the mind did not discover a certain uniformity among phe- nomena, and if it did not exercise selectiveness when establishing the amount of power inherent in different factors. Mind must operate as a "selector" (1) when posing the problem and (2) when "choosing" the "cause." Natural science is non-causal as a result, but causal as an endeavor which will never succeed. The scientist endowed with the causal mind will seek causes and find an enrichment of factual knowledge. The difference between the man of science and the common man is not that between one who knows "causes" and one who doesn't, but that between one having only his eyes and another having in addition a telescope and a microscope, viz., stronger eyes. The techniques of science do not add to any "inner" knowledge, but to the efficiency of senses. A</page><page sequence="8">498 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY "causal" science would be mystical. Determinism is animistic; it proceeds after the analogy of acts in dealing with events. It is patterned after the relationship of the doer and the thing done. And because that is so, the system seems to us "rational." But even if it is "rational," it may still have a practical or an objective value. " Cause" is a simile. When the Greeks adapted the word "aitia" meaning "guilt" as a symbol of "cause," they felt that the " cause " was the thing " guilty" of the event, i.e., the " author. " In German "Ursache" suggests by means of the prefix "ur" the parental relation symbolized in the word "'cause.'" The term "Grund" suggests the being "at the bottom" of other things, at the source, from which things spring. The Romance words " causa," " cosa," " chose," " cause, " are curiously interrelated. " Cause" means here obviously the very thing, the important thing. The concept is somewhat germane to "Ursache." The French con- junction "car" meaning "because" is a transformed Latin "quare" which in turn means "by virtue of which thing." In Polish "cause" would be "przyczyna" (pshtchina). Its original meaning is rather "contribution," the word consisting of the pre- fix "przy" and the root "czyn" which means simply "action." Thus "przyczyna" is "contributory action." In every given statement ("Urteil") with a verbal predicate (meaning action as a consequence) we may discern two simultane- ous mental operations: we analyze and synthetize at the same time. It is a piece of mental engineering. If we say "it thunders," we "twist" or "dissolve" the event (viz., an impersonal "happen- ing") into a subject, an "it," a soul, a source, a doing thing, and the doing itself; but at the same time we link them together, we arrange them into a unity after having spiritualized them. Why? We act after the likeness of our own actions. What for? In order to achieve a befitting fixity of conditions in our mental hand- ling of that phenomenon. It is just as though we should shoot a fluttering bird, stuff it, and put it afterwards into a show case for better observation and handling. Thus we engineer the events, the flowing stream of happenings or changes. It is a most im- portant technical achievement and foreshadows all other feats of technique. It is also their prototype, their preexisting eidolon and it "works" because it is an imitation of "nature," namely, of our own nature or structure. That may explain perhaps why "de- terminism" or "causalism" are fruitful although animistic. The conception that there are "parental" relations, that all is a system of acts, is not the result of mere "observation" of "out- side" events, but a projection from within. Our "statement," the</page><page sequence="9">BOOK NOTES 499 sentence, bear witness to that; they are a paradigm of "action" and hence "causality." Man being himself a bundle of "par- ental" relations, of "acts" emanating from an "author," can not conceive events otherwise than acts emanating from a subject. The mind of the scientist is "causal," the achievement of science, however, is not cause-finding but fact-finding by means of refined methods of observation or measurement. There is no essential, qualitative difference between the knowledge of the common man and the sublime thinker. It is a question of quantity. In that sense one might maintain that the wisdom of an infant is funda- mentally the same as that of Plato and the ethical thinker may discern in such an order of "equality" an instance of Eternal Justice.
