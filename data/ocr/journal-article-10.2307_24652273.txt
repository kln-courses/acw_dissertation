The Viskovatyi Affair of 1553-54: Official Art, the Emergence of Autocracy, and the Disintegration of Medieval Russian Culture* In November 1553 Tsar Ivan IV of Russia and Metropolitan Makarii, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, convened an ecclesiastical council to hear charges of heresy against State Secretary (cTz'afc)Ivan Mikhailovich Viskovatyi. It found Viskovatyi guilty of blasphemous criticism of icons, frescoes, and an altar with which artisans had decorated the Kremlin Church of the Annunci ation and the imperial palace after the disastrous fire of 1547. Viskovatyi repudiated his accusations and repented. On 14 January 1554 he received a sentence modified to three years of gradually moderating prohibitions from religious celebration, one for each of the three years of his perverse criti cism. 1 Our knowledge ot the Viskovatyi trial comes trom contemporary evidence that is relatively complete, unusually factual, and free of tendentious editing, features rare in the sources regarding crucial events of Ivan's reign. There is an extended account of the proceedings in a manuscript from the Volokolamsk Monastery. According to the Soviet historian A. A. Zimin, it is written in mid sixteenth century script and in its meticulous recording, even of Viskovatyi's • charges, appears to be the product of an official compiler and close to the trial record. Those parts which defects render unreadable are present in later, also defective, manuscripts from monastic libraries which include fragmen tary selections from records of the mid-century heresy trials.

The record is confusing as to Viskovatyi's sentences. The original sentence was a separation from the church and deprivation of sacraments for two weeks. That seems less onerous than the revised sentence handed down after Viskovatyi's capitulation.</page><page sequence="2">294 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE manuscripts have been shown to date from the late sixteenth century.2 In 1932 Nikolai Andreyev wrote an extended article about the affair.3 Over for ty years later new evidence has confirmed much of what Andreyev wrote about the stormy political and cultural life of Russia at mid-century. It also allows us to understand better than he the nature of Viskovatyi's criticism and its cultural and political significance. Between Ivan's coronation as the first Russian tsar in 1547 and the Vis kovatyi trial the government had achieved a series of impressive successes. In 1550 it formulated a new law code and began to fashion new service re quirements and administrative institutions to promote centralization and autocracy. In 1552 Russia's armies conquered and annexed the Khanate of Ka zan'. In 1547 and 1549 church councils canonized several dozen national saints and established central control of cults. The Stoglav council of 1551 organized the regulation of all aspects of ecclesiastical life. The emerging sense of national purpose evident in these achievements, however, did not signify the resolution of the divisive and longstanding factional and clan rivalries among the service elite and within the church which had raged during Ivan's minority. The trend toward autocracy since 1547,, if anything, increased the seriousness of these struggles. Therefore, when Ivan became critically ill in March, 1553, and ordered that his infant son succeed him should he die, the court divided over whether to obey. A large faction declared for Ivan's cous 2. The basic text (Moscow State Historical Museum, Eparkhal'noe Collection, No 432/14) is printed in ibid., pp. 1-41. See also P. M.

Ivan recovered to threaten those who had favored Vladimir's succession;4 the Viskovatyi trial came six months later. There is still much that we do not know about the political background of the trial. The situation permits wide latitude of interpretation. But new evi dence reveals that the political repercussions, especially within the church, were greater than Andreyev supposed and suggests a revision of his opinion that Makarii was an ally of the priest Sil'vestr and supporter of the anti autocratic Novgorodian aristocratic tradition. Because Viskovatyi attacked the new religious art as egoistic, or as under Latin or heretical influence, the trial record is vital to an understanding of the crisis that overtook Russian culture in the sixteenth century. Viskovatyi's arguments from authority and tradition eloquently testified to a distinctive truth about the iconography of the eastern church. Early on in the East the hellenistic tradition of anthropomorphic iconography with neoplatonic justifications overcame the iconoclasm of the early church. It also survived the iconoclast reaction, although iconoclast austerity lived on in the Orthodox insistence on adherence to conventional iconography which was presumably divinely inspired. Out of the ferment an ideal image of the Savior emerged. Its prototype was divinely wrought (literally, "not made by human hands"), the "holy face" miraculously imprinted on a canvas shroud by legend re ceived by King Abgar of Edessa (d. 50 A.D.). One of the standard images of the Mother of God supposedly derived from an image painted by Luke the Evangelist. Images of saints also evolved as stylized types. Such stylistic re ductionism allowed the illiterate faithful to comprehend the Christian drama and recognize the figures of their visions. In Greek neoplatonic terms such icons provided a divine illumination to the viewer because the icon participated in the sanctity of the prototype, identifying with it as a hypostasis although differing from it in essence. Icons and frescoes in the "classical" Byzantine style which emerged in the tenth century thus had a transcendental char acter. Their stiff figures, done in reverse perspective, floated in abstract and luminously ethereal backgrounds. They were timeless and powerful.5 Sub 4.

They produced in the late twelfth century and again in the Palaeo logue age an art in which painterly and shading techniques lent a humanity to its figures and achieved a partial three-dimensionality. The Palaeologue age also saw the emergence of a more complex and abstract iconography. These developments occurred, however, within narrow limits when compared with the art of Catholic Europe.6 The works which Viskovatyi attacked were only the most notorious of the artistic, literary, and building projects commissioned by Ivan or Makarii to glorify Russian tsardom.

Kondakov was the early theorist of Western renaissance influences on Russian art from Rublev on. It is now understood that the Palaeologue "renascence" was the progenitor of main trends in Russia and an important seminal influence on renaissance painting in Italy. See</page><page sequence="6">298 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE those he cited did not know the specific icons that drew Viskovatyi's ire. Soviet art historians have now identified and studied most of them.9 On the basis of these studies one can better define what Viskovatyi meant and also recast somewhat Andreyev's opinions on the extent, nature, and sources of Western influences. It is the author's argument that the new art was an ec lectic mix of revisionist forms within Orthodoxy and West European models, although not generally the ones that Andreyev supposed. The innovations were the following: thematic development of untraditional written sources or fresh interpretations given to familiar stories, the employment of unortho dox symbolic and allegorical iconography, a historicism marked by a chrono logical and geographical consciousness and attempts at naturalistic portrai ture, innovative portraiture of living people, and an obsession with temporal concerns. These were evidence of an individualism in the creative process and the breakup of medieval artistic conventions in Russia. The conclusions sup port the recent suggestion of 0.1. Podobedova that the beginning of the crisis in the medieval world view in Russia is better dated to the mid-sixteenth than, as has been generally held, to the seventeenth century.10 Most of the actors in the Viskovatyi proceedings were powerful political figures. Ivan IV and Metropolitan Makarii presided over the trial. Ivan was twenty-three, intelligent, ambitious, and had learned to enjoy using his power. Makarii, probably in his seventies, was a skillful plotter in the tradition of Iosif Volotskii, that is, an autocrat in church affairs, a defender of monastic wealth, and a fanatical ideologue of Russian tsardom. Viskovatyi himself was an in fluential official. In 1542 he had become pod'iachii of the Posol'skaia izba, a title and office which might be rendered as undersecretary of the foreign of microfilm of Lazarev, "Iskusstvo srednevekovoi Rusi i Zapad," in XIII mezhdunarodnyi kongress istoricheskikh nauk.

Balashov et al., eds., Literatura epokhi vozrozh deniia (Moscow: Nauka, 1967), pp. 189, 204. Ostrogorsky thought the new Kremlin ait so at variance with Orthodox practice that he concluded that Makarii must have had little or nothing to do with the writing of the rules of the Stoglav: "Les décisions du 'Stoglav,' " p. 402. 9. The first-and for a time overlooked-identification of the "Four-part" icon as the main object of Viskovatyi's criticism was made by Kondakov, The Russian Icon, tr. and abridged by E. H. Minns from a Russian original never published (Oxford: Clarendon "Press, 1927), p. 105. See note 24 for a list of the icons and their present location.

In 1549 he became its chief and, in addition, a d'iak of the Boiar Duma, the council of notables with which Ivan ruled Russia. In the late 1540s and 1550s Viskovatyi accompanied Ivan IV on campaigns and his name appeared in connection with important diplomatic functions. The trial also involved the famous but enigmatic Sil'vestr and a certain Simeon, both priests of the Church of the Annunciation, the family church of Russia's rulers. Sil'vestr supervised the Kremlin restorations, and the correspondence of Ivan and Prince A. M. Kurbskii attributed to him a Svengali-like influence on Ivan. While many historians have found such claims extravagant, they have been unable to substantiate alternative positions. Aware of the jealousy of the rela tives of Ivan's wife Anastasia, Sil'vestr opted for Vladimir's candidacy in the dynastic crisis of 1553. Then, to salvage his position he became the principal accuser of heretics in trials from which Viskovatyi's indictment emerged. Sil'vestr's deposition to the council remains one of the two authenticated sources which record directly the priest's words. The accused heretics were Matvei Bashkin, a minor service man at court, together with Ivan Timofee vich Borisov and his brother Grigorii Timofeevich, the monk Artemii, and sev eral other monks. The Borisovs were small landowners in the principality of Tver'. It is likely that they belonged to the court of Vladimir Andreevich, Ivan having been at Vladimir's wedding in 1549 and their relative F. B. Borozdin having held land in Staritsa. Given the continued strength of clan ties in Mus covite society, they shared the disgrace of Vladimir's party after the dynastic crisis. Bashkin's association with the Borisovs made him politically vulnerable too. In mid-1553 Bashkin and the Borisovs were accused of heresy, and at the trial witnesses implicated Artemii in their transgressions. Artemii was the leader of the "non-possessor" [nestiazhatel'] faction within the church, which valued the ascetic tradition of Volotskii's rival Nil Sorskii and deplored the corruptive influence of landed wealth on monastic life. Between 1549 and 1553 Ivan had favored Artemii, inviting him to live in the Kremlin and then securing for him the abbacy of the great Trinity-St. Sergius Monastery. For Makarii and the majority of the hierarchy who were josephites, these were sufficient reasons to consider Artemii and his disciples dangerous and to en tertain heresy charges against them. Finally, Viskovatyi called in his defense Vasilii Mikhailovich Iur'ev-Zakhar'in and Mikhail Iakovlevich Morozov, both boiars related to Anastasia and, therefore, enemies of Vladimir Andreevich of Staritsa and his clan.11 11.

He had stirred up the populace and his actions had come to the attention of Ivan and Makarii.12 They may have disapproved and counselled him to be silent, but he went unpunished and continued in high office. At Bashkin's trial in October 1553, Viskovatyi resurrected his criticisms and linked them to the influence of Bashkin and Artemii. This brought him to trial and a council again heard his charges, ordered him to submit them in a written statement, argued with him, found him in error—but not a heretic—and re leased him practically without punishment.13 Whatever else, the trial exposed fkonets XV-XVI v.)

During the trial V. M. Iur'ev took pains to show that a book con taining canons written by St. Basil of Jerusalem, which he had given Vis kovatyi and which was said to have been a source of some of his errors, had come from the church where Sil'vestr served and that Sil'vestr had been fa miliar with the book and knew of its transfer to Viskovatyi. More important was the timing of Viskovatyi's criticism. Only after long and evidently sincere attacks on the new iconography did Viskovatyi link Sil'vestr's innovations to "heretical" influences of Artemii and Bashkin. The pattern was identical to that begun at Bashkin's trial, where accusations against Artemii were followed by his vilification, and then arraignment on charges of heresy.14 Sil'vestr and Simeon answered Viskovatyi's accusations with petitions which showed their awareness of the alarming turn the trial had taken. Re viewing Viskovatyi's charge that Artemii and Bashkin had led him to approve the uncanonical icons and altar, and to illustrate proverbs incorrectly in the palace frescoes, Sil'vestr claimed that he had neither sought the company of Bashkin or Artemii, nor sympathized with their views. Simeon, he said, had ferreted out Bashkin's unorthodox ideas, had told Sil'vestr, and they had promptly informed the tsar in July, 1553, actions which led to Bashkin's arraignment as a heretic. Sil'vestr emphasized that he had neither known Ar temii nor worked with him until the tsar had established him in the Kremlin in the Chudov Monastery and ordered that Sil'vestr favor him. He admitted to having been impressed with Artemii's wisdom, but no more so than others meaning Ivan. Only when Artemii's disciple and co-heretic Porfirii revealed them to Simeon did he discover Artemii's "base beliefs. Once informed, he had notified the tsar, causing Artemii to flee. Sil'vestr justified his refur bishing of the Kremlin with reference to precedents and to written authority, and tactfully reminded Ivan and the council that the tsar also had taken part in the collection and approval of icon painters and icons, including the images under attack.15 Simeon confirmed Sil'vestr's testimony regarding Bashkin, but revealed that he had informed Sil'vestr about him in the previous Lenten season, 6 Feb 14. PSRL, XIII, 523-26, and "Rozysk," pp. 15-16, 9-10, or "Moskovskie sobory na eretikov XVI veka," p. 5: "And I saw that they took down icons in which our lord Christ is depicted in the image of man and put up [icons] the nature of which had not been seen before, and I was very astonished and feared that I would find also every sort of insidiousness because Bashkin had consulted with Artemii and Artemii with Sil'vestr. And the priest Simeon is the spiritual father of Bashkin and was instructed to speak about and to justify their association out of fear."

He further revealed that Sil'vestr had advised him to keep silent "because he is [thy] spiritual son [and] it would be improper to relate his confession." In July Sil'vestr correctly informed the tsar of Artemii's and Por firii's heresy and about Bashkin, Simeon continued.16 Obviously Sil'vestr and Simeon had known Bashkin's and Artemii's beliefs but remained silent when Sil'vestr backed Prince Vladimir Andreevich of Staritsa. They may have sym pathized with them. But in July, when the cause was lost, Sil'vestr changed his mind about the sanctity of the confessional and denounced Bashkin as well as his collaborator Artemii before anyone could use his political mistake to denounce him as a co-heretic. Viskovatyi's objections to Sil'vestr's renovations were not shared by Met ropolitan Makarii and Ivan. Yet one cannot fully explain why the Viskovatyi case now came to trial unless Makarii hoped to use it to destroy Sil'vestr. To suggest this reopens the question, as yet unresolved, whether or not Sil'vestr's contacts with foreigners and with Artemii and the non-possessors show him tobe an enemy of the josephites and possibly a free thinker. Andre yev argued that he and Makarii shared spiritual and political values. But, ex cept for the similarity of their iconographie tastes, they had little in com mon.17 Opinions that Sil'vestr wrote the vita of St. Ol'ga in the Book of De grees of the Imperial Genealogy (Kniga stepennaia tsarskogo rodosloviia), which was compiled for Makarii by 1563, rest on shaky evidence. When Ma karius protégé in Novgorod, Archbishop Feodosii, sent Easter gifts in 1548 to important personages, he ignored Sil'vestr. Finally, Sil'vestr and his sons sought the patronage of the princely clans of Vladimir Andreevich and the Shuiskiis, loyalties uncommon for a supposed ally of Makarii.18 Other circum 16.

Sil'vestr had contact with the anti-josephite Metropolitan Ioasaf, Makarii's predecessor, and may have come to Moscow from Novgorod when Ioasaf was metropolitan (1538-42); he was the addressee of a letter from the impris oned critic of monastic wealth, Maxim the Greek, and apparently had close ties to him; finally,he had worked with Artemii when the latter enjoyed favor at court and when the court and the non-possessors were attacking the ex pansion of monastic properties just before and during the Stoglav council of 1551. Sil'vestr had to admit to such associations, while calling them in voluntary. He even had to confess his admiration for Artemii to the almost en tirely josephite council. If one accepts the testimony of Ivan's first letter to Kurbskii and that of the interpolation in the Tsarstvennaia kniga, which assert ed that Sil'vestr's influence had been so great that he could give orders to the metropolitan, then this reading of the evidence is all the more convincing.19 Makarii used Bashkin's trial to ensnare and outlaw Artemii and his friends as "Judaizer" heretics.20 Sil'vestr supplied some of the evidence, but under duress. Nevertheless, Viskovatyi implicated Sil'vestr and the new art in heresy, and this suggests that Makarii fostered or encouraged the expansion of the charges made by Viskovatyi, even if he did not believe in them, in order to bring down Sil'vestr. In this he could count on support at court from the Iur' ev-Zakhar'ins. Once the denunciation had served its purpose the court could show Viskovatyi leniency, and that is precisely what it did. The events of 1553-54 caused a reshuffling of political alignments in the Boiar Duma of greater significance than those precipitated during Ivan's mi nority. The clan of Vladimir Andreevich and its followers were humiliated. Many were punished. Ivan relied more closely on the Iur'ev-Zakhar'ins and other servitors of untitled families. Conversely,-he made fewer concessions to princely clan interests, although he continued to favor the Shuiskiis. Sil' vestr attached himself to the Shuiskiis and to the boiar Prince Dmitrii Kur 19.

This saved him from conviction as a heretic and he even re tained his post in the Kremlin. But it is impossible to accept literally state ments of Ivan and Kurbskii in their later polemics that Sil'vestr was at the height of his influence over Ivan in the mid-1550s.21 If after the dynastic crisis Ivan was as embittered against the dominating priest as he said he was, then one would have to posit that Ivan was as much a prisoner of elite fac tions as had been the case during his minority, a situation that flies in the face of other contemporary evidence. Also, there is no evidence that Sil'vestr had any influence after 1554. That he appeared in the Kremlin with Shuiskii pa tronage after the affair was reason enough for the suspicious Ivan to de spise him. In these shadowy maneuverings several trends emerge in sharp outline. Con cerning Ivan's maturing personality, historians since Kurbskii correctly have taken their cue from Ivan's visit with Bishop Vassian Toporkov of Kolomna, probably the nephew of Iosif Volotskii, while on pilgrimage to the Kirill Belozerskii Monastery in July, 1553. Torporkov advised him to rule autocrat ically and to punish aristocrats who contested his right to do so. According to Kurbskii, Ivan, shaken by the "betrayals" of 1553, was deeply affected by the conversation. The denunciations and counter-denunciations of favored clerics and officials in the trial ofViskovatyi could only have aggravated Ivan's incipient paranoia, evidenced in his mistrust of his servitors. Conversely, many princely families resented the Iur'ev-Zakhar'ins as untitled usurpers who crassly displayed their ambition in the dynastic crisis and the Viskova tyi affair. To the extent that Ivan allowed his relatives, influence, the mal contents withheld their confidence in his leadership. If Ivan's first letter to Kurbskii can be believed, these sores never healed and contributed greatly to the oprichnina in which Ivan brutally struck at "traitors" around him.22 21. Fennell, Prince A.

Makarii and the josephites subsequently convict ed Artemii and other non-possessors of heresy on trumped up charges, ending a half-century of struggle for control of the church. Victorious, they then inaugurated a systematic persecution and the authoritarian centralization of the hierarchy.23 The debates of the Viskovatyi trial also testified to a crisis in Russian cul ture. Viskovatyi stated his criticisms of the Kremlin renovations in writing to the council and in answers to Makarii. He attacked as many as eight new icons in the Church of the Annunciation, but particularly one known as the "Four-part" (Chetyrekhchastnaia) icon. Sil'vestr testified that on Ivan's order he had had the Pskov painters Ostania, Iakov, Mikhailo, Iakushko, Simeon Vysokoi and their colleagues paint the "Four-part" icon and three others, "The Last Judgment," "The Renewal of the Temple by the Resurrection of our Lord Christ," and "The Lord's Passion according to Proverbs of the Evan gelists." His own shop of Novgorod masters had painted icons of "Acts of the Holy Lifegiving Trinity," "Sophia, the Wisdom of God," and "It is Fitting." In addition, Viskovatyi denounced an icon "Symbol of the Faith," said to have belonged to Vasilii Mamyrev (d. 1490), a chronicler and official for Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow, an altar in the Church of the Annunciation, and part of the new frescoes on the walls and the ceiling of the "Gold Room" (Zolotaia palata), one of the throne rooms of the palace.24 Nothing angered Viskovatyi more than images of God the Son and God the Father in the upper two sections of the "Four-part" icon, on the left "And God Rested on the Seventh Day" (IPochi Bog v Den' Sed'myi), and on 23.

These panels erred in showing God the Father as either the Lord Sabaoth, the "Lord of Hosts," or according to the vision of Daniel 7:9, as a grey-haired elder, the "Ancient of Days" (Vetkhii Den'mi). The sources were impermissible and the image of the invisible God contrary to canon.25 Viskovatyi also said that the image of Christ crucified, covered with wings of the Cherubim, was a Latin invention. Nearby was a Christ with wings, as if an angel, present at Creation, a representation which Viskovatyi claimed that Scripture could not substantiate. To depict Christ as an angel demeaned him. On this Viskovatyi quoted St. Paul to the effect that Jesus was God in carnate.26 To depict the presence of the incarnate Christ crucified in the be ginning, even according to prophetic visions, was contrary to Scripture which admitted at Creation only the incorporeal divinity, a subject which mortals could neither fathom nor illustrate. The above images appeared in symbolic representations of the three persons of the Trinity which showed the Holy Spirit as a dove. This too Viskovatyi attacked as an uncanonical representation of that which could not be perceived by mortals. In support of these positions Viskovatyi cited rule eight-two of the Quinisextum Council of Constantino ple (691-92), and referred to a rule (not given) of the Seventh Oecumenical Council of Nicaea (787), a sermon of John "the Theologian" of Damascus entitled "In the beginning was the Word" and another called his forty-first, and an unidentifiable passage from a sinodicon or memorial book read in church services. Only images of God as the incarnate Christ visible to mankind, and of the Mother of God, the holy angels and of the saints were permissible. The sinodicon, he claimed, forbade the depiction of the Trinity or its con stituents symbolically or according to prophetic visions: "Verily, it is mirac ulous, because before the incarnation the Word was not received, yet they chatter that the most incomprehensible and invisible substance was made visi ble, or that it is laid down that images of the true incarnation and sign could become visible, [for] to depict the Word as incarnate ... is accursed."

It justified images of God the Son—but not according to prophetic visions, and of the Mother of God and the saints.28 In the composition "And God Rested" from the "Four-part" icon the Lord appeared in one place in imperial dress and crown, holding in his lap the crucified Christ. Apparently Viskovatyi had this section .in mind when he ob jected to the depiction of God in the image of David, saying that neither proph ets nor evangelists so described even God the Son. In the adjoining compo sition "The Only-begotten Son" Viskovatyi rejected an image of a "warrior" Christ, in armor with sword, sitting atop a cross. No source testified that Christ had had such an historical existence. Again Viskovatyi referred to rule eighty-two of the Quinisextum.29 In the same composition the crucified Christ, taken down from the cross and mourned by the Mother, the pietà image "Mother, weep not for me" ('We rydai mene, mati"), provoked Vis kovatyi to say that it contained "vain deceit" (mudrovanie suetnoe) or "the deceit of Latin heresies" (Latynskye eresi mudrovanie). This was because Christ's arms were folded across his body and his palms closed. On this Vis kovatyi quoted from the krestovoskresnii canon in the first verse of the sixth song in the Oktoikh, a service book translated from Greek which was divided into eight parts for chanting, to the effect that Christ's palms, open to the world, symbolized his offer of healing and salvation. The offending composi tion made Christ into an ordinary mortal incapable of saving man.30 Vis kovatyi found the other icons objectionable for the same and for several other reasons. In one, which cannot be identified, he discovered an image which symbolized Christ as a lamb representing the sacrifice and based on John 1:29 and Revelation 5:12. Viskovatyi argued that "the lamb is false in the image of Zalta, 1759-98), 11, cols. 977E-980B and 12, cols. 1125-1126.

This too he justified with reference to the same rule of the Quini sextum and to a rule ninety-two in a letter of St. Basil the Great to his dis ciple Amphilochius.31 Another icon he denounced because it had "The Word" written on the cross, suggesting that Christ suffered in divine as well as human form. He supported this with a ruling of the Seventh Oecumenical Council which he claimed to have found in a book obtained from V. M. Iur'ev-Za khar'in, and with references to writings of John of Damascus in a book be longing to Morozov. Finally, Viskovatyi was astonished to find in the Mamy rev icon the incorporeal Holy Spirit depicted as if it were visible.32 The new altar Viskovatyi found overweening in size, "no less than a throne compared to ordinary altars." Its unbalanced features exaggerated "divine over human aspects of Christ, although both were equal."33 In one of the central compositions on the ceiling of the Gold Room Viskovatyi detected near a figure of Christ that of a "female, as if dancing near [his] sleeve" (zhonka, spustia roukava kaby pliashet). Above her were the words "forni cation," "jealousy," and "passion," according to Viskovatyi, the image being part of an allegory of virtues and vices. Viskovatyi found it without basis in Scripture and indecent.34 Viskovatyi presented a conservative defense of traditional Orthodox iconog raphy. Symbolic representations of God according to prophetic visions, he added, would only confuse the illiterate, who were ignorant of the written authority behind such images. Viskovatyi blamed these errors on Bashkin's heresy and, coincidentally, on Latin influences. He even singled out one "Matias-liakh," or Matthew the Pole, the Kremlin druggist, as Bash kin's corruptor.35 In reply Metropolitan Makarii sharply rejected Viskovatyi's intrusion into theological matters and warned him that his criticism bordered on heresy. He then answered Viskovatyi's charges for the council with a learned dis course in which he denied that the seventh council had approved only the 31. "Rozysk," pp. 5-6: "The lamb is made in the image of our true Lord Christ, and it is not fitting to worship other than a true image." The reference is unclear.

Rule one, he claimed, justified the dramatization of canonical writings.36 The question of authority related to Viskovatyi's main charge that the icons, especially the upper compositions of the "Four-part" icon, depicted God in persons of the Trinity other than the "historical" God incarnate. One of these compositions showed the Lord Sabaoth pouring a liquid on Je sus, who was wrapped in the wings of the Cherubim. It signified, Makarii said, the "entrance of Christ into eternity" (vvedenie Khrista vo vselennuiu), and was a symbol of baptism and communion, the road to salvation, justified by the prophecy of David and the writings of evangelists. Here he injected a passage based on John 19:28-30 in which a thirsting Christ on the cross re ceived a taste of wine mixed with gall. Russian and Greek icons of the Lord Sabaoth were valid precedents. Among them Makarii mentioned an icon which Ivan IV had brought to Moscow from the Iur'ev Monastery in Novgorod and which, he claimed, had come five hundred years earlier from the Greek city of Cherson in the Crimea. He also cited Evfimii and other visiting elders who said such an image was in frescoes of their Panteleimon Monastery on Mt. Athos.37 In the composition "And God Rested" were two variants of another image of the Trinity called "Paternitas" (Otechestvo). The reclining white-robed elder as God the Father in a circle of the creatures of heaven, explained Makarii, was the "Ancient of Days" in the prophecy of Daniel 7:9. God the Son appeared as an angel, the messenger of the "Grand Council" (Prevechnyi Sovet) of the prophecy of Isaiah 9:6 in the Septuagint. He also found justification for the image in St. Paul's epistles to the Hebrews 1:1 14, 2:2, although these say only that Christ was higher than the angels. Maka rii mentioned a sinodicon and cited the second sermon for Easter of Greeorv Nazian (d. 389) in the eleventh interpretation, the Psalms, and a "fourteenth sermon" of John of Damascus as authority for the image of Christ as an angel in prophetic visions. Makarii also pointed to precedents in ancient icons from the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Novgorod and from churches in Tver', Pskov, and elsewhere, all faithful to Greek iconographical tradition. By contrast, Makarii admitted that he could not find an authority for the Holy Spirit as a dove, and that he would order the icon corrected.38 36. "Rozysk," pp. 2, 23-24.

He denied that these were images of the invisible persons of the Trinity ; they were true renderings of prophetic visions, recorded in Scripture and upheld by the apos tles and Church fathers. Another variant of the Trinity-Paternitas was in the lower right composition of the "Four-part" icon entitled "In the Grave in the Flesh, in Hell with His Soul as God, on the Throne with His Father, and in Paradise with the Penitent Thief' (Vo grobe plotski, vo ade zh s dusheiu, iako Bog, . .. ). A variant of the "Ancient of Days" alone also was in the lower left composition "Come, O People, and worship God in Three Persons" (Priidite liudie triipostasnomu bozhestvu poklonimsia).39 The Trinity-Pa ternitas image in the composition "And God Rested" represented Christ as present in the beginning. Makarii said it was based on Genesis 2:2, and that Archangel Gabriel, the Psalms, and the Book of Revelation proclaimed the existence of three persons of the Trinity, the idea of atonement, and the heav enly host from the beginning. Further, he claimed the authority of a sermon on Christ's incarnation by St. Paul, mystifyingly numbered the one hundred and thirty-first, a sermon on Christ's incarnation from St. John Chrysostom (d. 407), a selection from John's collection of aphorisms known as the Marga rit, and the inspiration of Dionysius the Areopagite, the legendary author of neoplatonic Christian writings in the sixth century.40 Makarii s other arguments rebutted related criticisms raised by Viskovatyi concerning this and other icons. The inscription "God the Word" on the cross did not signify the visibility or the crucifixion of the invisible person of God, but only that he was present. Citations of authorities inevitably fol lowed: a passage from John of Damascus' sermon "God the Word appears in carnate," and from lur'ev's book a rule of the Seventh Oecumenical Council concerning Christ's passion but which made no mention of "God the Word." Makarii said that Viskovatyi also had cited erroneously John of Damascus from Morozov's book. Iur'ev and Morozov here gave testimony in which they disassociated themselves from Viskovatyi's errors. Makarii thrice justified the image of the "warrior" Christ from "The Only-begotten Son" panel of the 39.

The image was from the prophets (unnamed), found in the psalms (possibly the forty-fourth of David in the Septuagint), in a sermon of John Chrysostom "At [thy] right hand stands the empress . . . with sword,"41 and in an adaptation of the Wisdom of Solomon 5:18-19, in the Septuagint: "He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate and true judgment as a helmet, and he shall bring down retribution on enemies, that is the devil and his host and mortal heretics who wrongly slander the Lord, whom the Lord shall kill with the spirit of his mouth."42 The Mamyrev icon "Symbol of the Faith," like the "Four-part" icon and others, was a symbolic representation of the Creed. It represented God the Father as the "Ancient of Days" and Christ as an angel. Makarii's defense of these images was repetitious. However, he did add that the division of the icon into two boards (kioty), for Viskovatyi another division of the divine substance into separate persons, was irregu lar.43 Makarii conceded to Viskovatyi that he knew no precedent for the depic tion of the Lord as David, that is, in imperial garb, or for the image of a cruci fied Christ with closed palms. He ordered that the latter be corrected to show the palms open but ignored Viskovatyi's accusation that the aberration re sulted from Latin influence. And, Makarii warned, Viskovatyi had interpret ed a verse from the Oktoikh about the image in a heretical manner to make his point. By contrast, Makarii upheld the canonicity of the new altar and the Gold Hall frescoes. The altar resembled altars in the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Novgorod, in churches in Smolensk, Nizhnii Novgorod, and the Pecherskii Monastery, and in other ancient churches. Makarii defended the frescoes without mentioning the female whose depiction near Jesus had angered Vis kovatyi. He described the allegorical rendering of the virtues and vices and said that they were inspired by proverbs of the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Eze kiel, and Daniel, and by prophecies of David and St. Paul. Makarii also ex plicated the allegory from an episode in the vita of Basil the Great where the saint converted his disciple, the philosopher Evvul, but this failed because his version of the episode did not explain the fresco. Even in his list of por trayed vices Makarii differed from Viskovatyi, who must have erred; Makarii's 41. "Rozysk," pp. 15-16, 19, 21, 36; and plate 6.

The offending female may have been one of those representing the vices or, less likely, the figure in the adjoin ing fresco of the earthly sphere representing the sun symbolically.44 Prophetic visions were canonical sources from which to draw images of God, concluded Makarii. He added that the icons had as models Greek icons, that holy writings were their inspiration, and that the indicted heretics Bash kin and Artemii had not used Sil'vestr or Simeon to influence the restoration. Makarii rebuked Viskovatyi for not coming to religious authorities with his criticisms and for denouncing the restoration publicly and without evidence.45 While judgments as to whether Makarii or Viskovatyi was correct are bet ter left to theologians, historians may profit from what the debate reveals about the iconographie and stylistic novelties in the new art. Borrowing from legal terminology, one might categorize Viskovatyi's arguments as those of a strict constructionist, particularly in his insistence that images of God must take only the form of the incarnate Christ in which he had revealed himself to the apostles. His citations were either correct or strictly within the spirit of the iconodule fathers, article eighty-two of the Quinisextum, and the Sev enth Oecumenical Council.46 Viskovatyi might have cited also the author ity of the Stoglav Council of the Russian church held in Moscow in 1551. Several of its articles indicated Ivan IV's concern over artistic innovation in the restoration, notably in the Pskov icons which represented the three persons of the Trinity in allegory. Chapter forty-three cited John of Damascus to the effect that icons be done according to rule and tradition and not by imagin ation. Also, the seventh question and answer in chapter forty-one referred to the canonicity of depicting living people in that part of the "Four-part" icon entitled "Come, O People." The council ruled that it was permissible, and perhaps that was why Viskovatyi ignored it despite its novelty in Russian iconography.47 44.

Only Makarii main tained that symbolic or allegorical images were canonical if based on approved texts and iconographie precedents. Although he was uncritical in examining whether the models themselves might be uncanonical, he had little trouble finding satisfactory precedents. The gap between rule and reality in Ortho dox iconography was wide enough that Makarii, applying a loose construc tionist interpretation, could find the new art properly done. Nevertheless, the images in question were remarkable for their originality. In fact, they illustrated the disintegration of the Russian medieval tradition. Into the familiar language of comprehensible images with which medieval Chris tians, East and West, built an imago mundi illustrating God's work, the new art introduced five significant variations.48 One was the elaboration in art of untraditional written sources or the novel employment of familiar sources. Since the eleventh century liturgical hymns occasionally had inspired art in Byzantium. The Kremlin restoration and related art carried this practice to an extreme in the frequency, the complexity, and the originality of con cepts to be illustrated. In the "Four-part" icon as many as three panels, and numerous motifs within them, had as sources liturgical hymns which drama tized trinitarian or christological dogma.49 Josef Myslivec has shown that Or thodox hymns inspired the pietâ in the "Four-part" icon and also in the icon of Sil'vestr's masters "It is Fitting." The image of Christ as an angel came from tropari of several odes in the Easter canon of John of Damascus.50 And eighth-century hymns of John of Damascus and Cosmas of Mai'uma inspired Russian icons of "Sophia, the Wisdom of God," including that in the Annun ciation church. A liturgical chant, in this case one for Holy Saturday, also in spired both the frescoes in the entrance to the Sviiazhsk church and the panel 48. Useful discussions of medieval imagery are A. Ia. Gurevich, Kategorii sredneve kovoi kul'tury (Moscow: Iskusstvo, 1972), pp. 15-20, 262-63, and Ladner, "Medieval and Modern Understanding of Symbolism," Speculum, 54 (1979), 223-56. 49. A verse of a hymn for Pentecost inspired the panel "Come, O People." "In the Grave in Body" illustrated a tropar' of the Easter canon. The panel "The Only-begotten Son" better corresponded to the stikhyra for six voices for the morning of Great Satur day than to the less detailed hymn from the liturgy of John Chrysostom with the same title, usually mentioned as the source according to Podobedova, Moskovskaia shkola zhivopisi, pp. 42-43, 47-48. Myslivec, "Liturgickê hymny iako nâme'ty ruskych ikon," Byzantinoslavica, 3, pt. 2 (1931), 462-96, suggested that the practice originated in Rus sia, probably in Pskov. G. K. Vagner saw the first liturgical sources in Russian art in fres coes based on the acathistus to the Mother of God by the school of Dionisii around 1500 in the Ferapont Monastery, Problema zhanrov v drevne-russkom iskusstve (Moscow: Iskusstvo, 1974), pp. 231-32. 50.

These stories came from secular sources, the first having its origin in the Russian Primary Chronicle and the second in the so-called Letter of Spiridon-Sawa, an early-sixteenth-century composition. Makarii's scribes had elaborated them to make Ivan IV the heir of the two Vladimirs and their deeds into founding legends of the Russian state. The representation of virtues and vices in the same frescoes was prob ably an adaptation of Basil the Great. Elsewhere in the frescoes a young tsar named Joasaphat led a troop of soldiers. Instructing him was a wise hermit named Barlaam. The painting dramatized a Byzantine hagiographical romance, in fact a Christian version of the life of Buddha, its two heroes ori ginally being manifestations of dual aspects of the Buddha.5 ^ it is also es tablished that masters did the portraits of Russian princes and tsars in the frescoes of the Church of Michael the Archangel in the 1550s or 1560s to resemble the order of transfer of authority from Kiev to Moscow developed by 1563 under Makarii in the Book of Degrees of the Imperial Genealogy,53 A second break with the medieval Russian imago mundi was the unortho dox use of allegorical and symbolic imagery. None was more important or ap peared more frequently in the new icons and frescoes than variants of the Trin ity-Paternitas. The first stage in its development occurred in Byzantium, where painters began to depict God the Son as the "Ancient of Days." In the twelfth century Catholics began to use this figure to represent God the father. Although uncanonical and despite protests, this usage also appeared in 51.

V. N. Lazarev tells us that it appeared once in Rus' about 1400, but before the renovation of the mid-sixteenth century it was a rarity. Viskovatyi might well have found it sus pect because variants of it in the "Four-part" icon and in the Sviiazhsk church frescoes contained unusual features: in both the crucified Son ap peared in angel's wings. Furthermore, in one section of the "Four-part" icon God poured a liquid on the Son and in another the persons of the Trinity were side by side and separated.54 Viskovatyi also picked out innovations in christological imagery, one being the "warrior" Christ portrayed in the "Four part" icon and mentioned in the description of another new icon which did not survive. This depiction transformed Christ from a symbol of victory over death into the mercilous judge of mankind of Wisdom 5:18-19 and crusader in the spirit of the icon "The Church Militant." The "Four-part" icon con tained also the pieti image of Christ with palms turned against his body, not to mention the Christ-angel discussed above. These portrayals were common in the West. They also appeared occasionally as late developments in eastern iconography. The latter appeared in the thirteenth century in Ochrid, later at the Studenica church in Serbia, and became familiar only in the Palaeologue era. One encounters it in Rus' once in the fourteenth century but rarely thereafter. The earliest pietl in the East, argued Myslivec, was in miniatures of the twelfth or thirteenth century; it included the Mother of God from the fourteenth, and became common onlv in the sixteenth.55 A traditional icon reworked symbolically was "Sophia, the Wisdom of God" by Pskov masters in the Annunciation church.

Based on Luke 11:49 and Proverbs 9:1-12, the figure of Sophia linked the wisdom of Solomon with the birth of Christ. Her temple was the universal church, the seven pillars of the church being the seven oecumenical councils recognized by the Orthodox. Its home was now Moscow. The image appeared in Rus' in the Bolotovo frescoes in Novgorod in the late fourteenth century. Its appear ance in the mid-sixteenth was something of a revival. In the Gold Room fres coes the break with tradition was evident as well in the symbolic iconography of traditional themes from the Old Testament, for instance, three cycles of mo ralistic stories of the "tsars" Joshua, Gideon, and Ezekiel. The latter two cy cles decorated the wall opposite Ivan IV's throne. The Gold Room frescoes also contained images without precedent in Russian art: the allegory of vir tues and vices, the allegorical frescoes of the seasons of the year, the battle of day and night, and the "earthly sphere" over which travelled the sun symbol ized by a woman.56 A third innovation in the restoration art was its historicism. It was evident in the introduction of a consciousness of time, in attempts at establishing concrete settings, and in a more accurate portraiture. With rare exception medieval man viewed existence as "outside of time." It is true that the educat ed elite in Europe at various times turned either to cyclical patterns of his torical explanation common to the classical world or to eschatological linear models. But cyclical theories eventually became theologically suspect, and eschatological models invariably divided sacral time, which was unchanging and eternal, from "human" time which had beginning and end. Human time, however, often became a series of unconnected and undifferentiated events caused by divine intervention so that time stood still. Alternatively, segments oi time in numan mstory illustrated eternal venties in sucn manner mat tne icon for the Orthodox was a window to the eternal. Even in Catholic art past and present came together in anthropomorphic forms in wall painting or sculpture which decorated medieval cathedrals. Often masters in frescoes elab orated eternity as a sphere in which life was a cycle.5 7 The sphere was broken 56.

By means of inno vation in design and a resort to illustrated narrative artists combined sacral and human time by setting events into interconnected, linear, chronological segments and into concrete historical contexts. The Pskov icons "The Lord's Passion," "The Renewal of the Temple" and "The Last Judgment" were in a "vita" style. Illustrating the life and mira cles of a saint in a series of little "scenes" around the borders of an icon was an established practice, Byzantine examples from Mt. Sinai existing from the eleventh century. The new icons differed in that the board was unusually large and the central picture unusually small. Most of the board carried two rows of such scenes. Furthermore, to achieve continuity of narrative, the Pskov masters broke down the frames between scenes by dividing them with physical features common to both or by using color to link parts of the story. The result was a sensation of movement and causal narrative. The Gold Room frescoes in part also must have exhibited linear historical organization. The history of Old Testament "tsars" and of the "tsars" of Rus' unfolded in a series of scenes or, elsewhere, in lines of portraits of rulers, as if they were parts of an ongoing story. The appearance of Old Testament kings in medieval art had many precedents. But as André Grabar' noted, in the Ravenna mosa ics' cycles of Old Testament figures they appeared as parallels to Christian counterparts. This was typical of medieval portraiture in general. In the Gold Room frescoes the implication was that they were ancestors of their Chris tian counterparts. Concern for "orderly narrative," as against "epic" time in which great events repeated themselves out 01 context, was also true or the Gold Room frescoes showing the baptism of Rus' and the legend of the im perial crown presented to Vladimir Monomakh. The famous "Church Mili tant" icon was exclusively a "story" icon of an historical event, Moscow's victory over Kazan' in 1552. Even its large size and unique horizontal shape were means of narrative emphasis.5 ® Khudozhestvennaia literatura, 1971), pp. 232-33, 278ff.; I. E.

Especially in the East stylized figures posed before stylized buildings and populated stylized landscapes which were oblivious to differences of historical periods or else corrupted by anachronisms. Erwin Panofsky has explained that medieval art denied the subject as well as the object; it sought the materialization of forms independent of historical reality. By contrast, the Pskov masters introduced into the icons "The Lord's Passion" and "The Renewal of the Temple" a profusion of detail to create an authentic historical background. The inventory of the Gold Room frescoes also suggests attempts at such naturalism. These techniques were clearly pres ent in the miniatures of the contemporary Illuminated Chronicle of "Rus sian" history. 0. I. Podobedova has shown here innovations designed, not al ways successfully, to achieve recognizable architectural and geographical fea tures and styles appropriate to the time and place, and thus to create realis tic paysage or at least a "psychological parallelism."59 Finally, the painters of the above icons and the illustrators of the Illuminated Chronicle strove for a historical naturalism in portraiture. In the Palaeologue "renascence" an emo tionality or individualism in portraiture emerged to modify the classical By zantine figures with their ritualized expressions. This humanization was more pronounced in the art of the South Slavs and, about 1400, of Rus'. Although Russian painters of the sixteenth century turned away from the emotionalism of this "renascence," the masters who did the Illuminated Chronicle at tempted to dress historical personalities in appropriate garb and make their faces express emotions corresponding to their time, place, and part in the drama of history.60 In the new art masters also broke with traditional representation of his torical persons in four ways. One was the injection of figures of living persons into icons with established iconographie schemes of theological symbolism. It was another means to merge sacral and historical time.

Ivan IV had questioned the propriety of such practices at the Stoglav council, referring to the lowest register of the lower left panel "Come, O People," in the "Four-part" icon. There, in reverence to God "in three persons" was a group of kneeling figures in court and clerical dress, among them a young tsar and tsaritsa—Ivan and Anastasia, an infant—their heir, a bishop—Metropolitan Makarii. A representation of Ivan and another of Makarii also intruded into the fresco "The Grand Entry" in the Sviiazhsk church.61 These and other examples illustrated that the renovators' passion for allegory carried over to the treatment of living people. Thus the "Barlaam and Joasaphat" fresco in the Gold Room may well have been intended to edu cate Ivan on the proper relationship between himself and either Sil'vestr or, less likely, Makarii. In the same hall another cycle of moralistic frescoes ex pressed the proposition that God favored the empire of the emperor who stood in fear of Him. In three of these the central figure was a "young tsar" being blessed by an angel of the Lord. Finally, the icon "The Church Militant" interpreted the victory over Kazan' by portraying the tsar as a young mounted warrior leading his triumphal army from a burning city, heralded to his holy capital by the Archangel Michael, and followed by the glorious among his an cestors.^ 2 Another innovation was the portrayal of the tsar as a layman with out a halo. In Byzantine mosaics, frescoes and icons after the inconoclast per iod hieratic images of the ruler, in which stylized traits portrayed the sacral character of the imperial office, superseded images interested in his physical person. As early as the Ravenna mosaics with rare and standardized excep tions these Byzantine figures, even representations of living persons of the sixth century, had halos attesting to their sacred office. In the new Kremlin art and related works, despite their patent intent to glorify Moscow's imperial tradition, the ruler was without nimbus.63 61.

The inventory of theGold Room frescoes did not mention</page><page sequence="28">320 RUSSIAN HISTORY/HISTOIRE RUSSE My fifth argument for the originality of the Kremlin art is that the utili zation of new sources, the new imagery, the historicism and experiments in portraiture were directed mostly at temporal concerns. Dogmatic religious scenes, including symbolic representation of Sophia the Holy Wisdom, the Trinity, notably as Paternitas, and of the great councils and the church united decorated the ceilings of the Gold Room. Surrounding them were didactic and moralistic representations instructing the viewer about Old Testament he roes, Russia's Christianization and imperial investment, and the relationship of rectitude to imperial power. Lowest on the walls, arches, and pillars were the portraits of Old Testament "tsars" and Russian princes. These schemes better exalted Moscow and Ivan IV than God. Even the cycle devoted to Joshua's victories should be understood as a timely example for Ivan IV during the campaigns against Kazan'. The "Church Militant" icon and the very exist ence of the Sviiazhsk Monastery and its frescoes as a center for conversion of the Kazan' land were meant to glorify Moscow's destiny. The icon "Sophia the Holy Wisdom" and its counterpart in the Gold Room frescoes were on one level references to the Russian tsardom as the new home of true belief. Even the "Four-part" icon was a teaching icon. It explained the complexities of trinitarian and christological dogma in a manner which brought the tsar and his court into the icon in reverence to "God in Three Persons" and instruct ed Ivan in the roles of merciless judge and crusader with its figure of the "warrior" Christ.64 The imperial art of the 1550s and the 1560s was an eclectic confusion of traditional and novel values and techniques. The disintegration of forms in the mid-sixteenth century showed vividly that the medieval world view in Russia was crumbling away. Artisans who did the Kremlin restoration and re lated art never developed the sense of historical distance from the past or the halos; Zabelin, Materialy dlia istorii, cols. 1243,1250-55. On Byzantine impérial iconog raphy, see Grabar, L'Empereur dans l'Art byzantin, especially pp. 163-87, and Christian Iconography, pp. 64-66; Rice, The Art of Byzantium (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1959), plates opposite pp. 26, 30, 46. The frescoes of Serbian tsars of the fourteenth century show them with halos with the exception of a few non-ritualistic imperial portraits in manuscripts; Velmans, "Le Portrait dans l'Art des Paléologues," figures 21-25, 39-40, 47-48. That the fresco of Prince Iaroslav Vladimirovich and his family done about 1055 in St. Sophia in Kiev portrayed them without halos should not invalidate the argument. For the Rus' or Greek artisans who decorated the church Iaroslav was not an emperor. Also, this was probably a "donor" image, one of the few inconsistently sacral forms of imperial iconography in the East. See Lazarev, "Novye dannie o mozaikakh i freskakh Sofii Kievskoi;gruppovoi portret semeistva Iaroslava," Vizantiiskii vremennik, 15 (1959), 148-69. Pokrovskii thus erred in saying that Russians in the sixteenth century began to depict their rulers as saints: Ocherki pamiatnikov khristianskago iskusstva, pp. 291-92, and "Opredeleniia Stoglava o sv. ikonakh," pp. 550-54. 64.

For that matter, the same was true for Russian artists of the seventeenth century. Yet they had the creative imagination to render familiar themes in new symbols of their own choosing. Most of these works displayed a consciousness that this was a new age, related to but distinct from the past, or from a series of pasts.65 Others before and after Viskovatyi sensed the violation of forms in Russian art which the d'iak called "egoistic innovations." Archbishop Gennadii of Novgorod did so in the 1490s in a letter on the suppression of heresy. In an anonymous letter, the Poslanie ikonopistsu, the author, probably Iosif Volot skii, had noted vulgarizations in new icons and condemned concrete images of the "unborn, immortal,invisible, incorporeal, indescribable, not repeatable, and ineffable" God the Father. Maxim the Greek reacted favorably to a rep resentation of Christ as David, according to a letter of the diplomat-translator Dmitrii Gerasimov to d'iak Misiur Munekhin about 1518/19. The same Dmitrii criticized a Novgorod icon which depicted the incorporeal strength of God and questioned several icons of Pskov origin similar to those which Gennadii had condemned. But in general he defended controversial representations, as Makarii later did, by citing precedents. Later, in Poland-Lithuania Artemii (a fugitive heretic) and the L'viv Brotherhood wrote against the representation of God the Father as the "Ancient of Days." Also, we know that the monk Evfimii of the Chudov Monastery in the Kremlin defended the same image against other critics. And sometime after the Viskovatyi affair the monk Zi novii Otenskii criticized iconographie innovations among which was the image of the warrior Christ. Ironically, the art of the 1550s so quickly became as cendant that a century later the Old Believer schismatics worshiped it as the essence of traditional Russian spirituality.66 65.

They easily blended with the new forms and techniques of eastern iconography or inspired further variations in them. The Jesus with closed palms in the "Four-part" icon was a case in point. It may have had east ern antecedents, although the official church and many historians have in sisted on its western provenance, it being more common there.6® Lazarev a greed with Viskovatyi that the Christ with wings in the "Four-part" icon was influenced by western art but, again, there were a few Byzantine precedents. Lazarev concluded that Catholic models also inspired at least one Paternitas composition, that with its three persons arranged horizontally in the lower right part of the same icon. The image of Christ as a lamb may likewise have been a western intrusion, it being alien to eastern iconography since the Quini sextum had condemned it.69 German and Flemish engravings inspired the fig ures, architectural forms and naturalistic detail in the "vita" icons and in the miniatures of the Illuminated Chronicle. The art of the European printed book may as well have inspired the narrative organization and imagery in the Gold Room frescoes.70 67.

His ambiguous position causes us to reexamine the conserva tive label usually given to the josephite movement which he led in his time. Iosif Volotskii had opposed the new icon styles. The josephite Makarii spon sored them as well as supporting written works that were stylistically and the matically original. The same historical and moral didacticism and crude nat uralism ran through most of the art and the writings of the Time of Trou bles and the seventeenth century. One may argue that the insistently religious vocabulary and imagery of this art better reflected the medieval rather than the modern man's view of the world. But in this case the triumph at court in the mid-sixteenth century of an obsessively theocratic culture upset the equi librium of the traditional medieval world view.
