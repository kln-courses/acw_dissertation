<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MEDEA SIMILES OF APOLLONIUS RHODIUS T HERE CONTINUES TO BE A GENERAL DISREGARD among classicists for the Alexandrian poets. Such disinterest is understandable in those writers whose fragmentary survival is due solely to the curiosity and diligence of antiquarians like Athenaeus, who has left us a treasure house of anecdote and gastronomy in the Deipnosophistae, and Joannes Stobaeus, whose sixth-century jottings preserve all that remains of a number of ancient poets. Often these scanty fragments are interesting only-as Stobaeus and Athenaeus intended-to the dilettante and scholar. It is distressing, however, that Apollonius of Rhodes, who remains as well represent- ed in the twentieth century as most ancient poets, should also suffer wholesale dis- missal; or worse-that studies made to determine his goals and artistic purpose have generally followed traditional lines, ignoring the accepted fact that the practice of "Alexandrianism" was quite alien to the heroic concepts of earlier epic literature. Critics seem, as a matter of fact, still unwilling or unable to accept Apollonius on his own terms, even though the great Alexandrian movement which swept European and American literature at the beginning of the twentieth century has at last established the proper context for Callimachus, Theocritus, Meleager, and a number of Augustan poets. We are perhaps blinded by the outward epic form of the Argonautica and prefer to judge Apollonius for what he is not rather than for what he is. And yet only a moment's reflection is sufficient to see that the best passages in the Argonautica- those which demonstrate Apollonius' ability to shape and give meaning to a particular context-are those which reveal most the Hellenistic nature of his art and his departure from the norms of epic tradition. It is scarcely the purpose of this article to vindicate the entire Argonautica. But it is possible in the survey of a half dozen of Apollonius' similes to show that this lengthy poem is neither a pale reflection of all that was great in Greek epic poetry nor a halting archetype awaiting the coming of later and greater poets for fuller expression of its poetic intention. Unquestionably Apollonius' art and imagination triumph in the third and fourth books of the Argonautica where he describes the blooming of Medea's love for Jason and the effects it has on her actions and personality. Basic to Apollonius' description of the young girl is the handful of similes portraying the vacillation and perturbation caused by her infatuation. Yet it is these similes, several of them unexcelled in ancient literature, which are brushed aside by many scholars. Critical opinion sees them either as labored adaptations of a Homeric concept to an Alexandrian ambience or as the basis for an idea or an image which Vergil some centuries later developed far more effectively. Either evaluation overlooks the lavish store of invention they contain and the complexity of texture and emotion with which Apollonius has endowed them. 3.291-298: 98 e ) - uyvvi IaXep 7T nCep KcpOea XCeaTo 8aXci Xepprt-L, T77Cep raXauoata 'pya p-pl7Xhcp, CDC KeCV TwCpdotov VOKTWCp aeXaC CPTVVaouTO, &lt;iyXt xadX' dypoduprl * To 6' 5 d-aearov u - bhoyoto 8aXoL dveypoevov obv K dpqea nrw' &amp;paOl vet - Toioc brrb KpaSbl e iXhvdvog a'i'Oero Xh6pn obhoc "Epw c drrak, .e d- TereCTpWTrao lTapetl, ic X dov, &amp;XXhor' -pevOoc, hKrlCiOt l vdoo.</page><page sequence="2">THE MEDEA SIMILES OF APOLLONIUS RHODIUS 311 This remarkable simile finds its origin in the Iliad (12.432-435), where Homer sees the battle between Trojans and Achaeans evenly drawn as the scale balanced in a working woman's hand when she measures "the wool against the weights." It appears again in the Aeneid (8.408-413), when Vergil compares Vulcan's morning sprint to his forge to a housewife hastening to kindle the fire before dawn so that she may begin her spinning. Yet it is only in Apollonius that the simile is given an emotional content and rises above the picturesque. In a discussion of Propertius' elegy 2.12, beginning "Quicumque ille fuit, puerum qui pinxit Amorem," Kenneth Quinn1 suggests that the word amor, in this case eros, supports three distinct interpretations: that of the love god in his anthropomorphic form; love, the sentiment; and love, the power which forces one to fall in love. Hlis observation is most pertinent in this passage, where Eros first suggests the God of Love himself and recalls the preceding scene in which he visited Medea to pierce her with one of his arrows; and secondly represents the power which forces her to love, a meaning reinforced by the use of oz3Xoc, "merciless" or "baneful." To accept the double concept of love opens the simile to many interpretations and allows each reader to react to its many overtones. For example, the weaving woman lights a fire in her home; Eros, the weaver of wiles, secretly ignited the fires of love in Medea's heart. Eros works secretly; the weaver in the dark. Both Medea and the weaver are in need; the flame is a pleasure to them both, since it is warmth and light for one and love and illumination for the other. Yet Apollonius is careful to suggest that the tinder burns only briefly. When finally the flame is spent, both the weaver and Medea will find themselves in darkness once more. 3.656-664: &amp;ce 6' OrTE rTe vtvbp7 OaXepo'v nrot6w bv OaXdpotltv pdperat, c3 p/ty 7'Ua Uav eX(oeoti / 705 oK T7eC, ob'6 Ti 7T c 7rauatlq c7rtploYeTalt pZtuOXowwr aiSol TrtCpooav Te - pvxc 6' a-Xovoa Oadoact To7 6i 7Ttq CXCuCe polpa, nrdpoc Tap7nrCPevat aipCw 6WveuWtv XXi7Xwv- 1 f6' Pv6oOt 6atopv77 7rep ucya pXa K Xaiet Xjpov 6XoC et' uopdwca, i77 p1w KepTrodiovoat aTLTrodCwotUL yvvalKec 17 K-Xr77 Mi76eta KW tVpero. J. H. E. Crees and J. C. Wordsworth2 describe this simile as "pretty" and "pictur- esque." Elsewhere it seems to go unmentioned. Yet the simile displays throughout Apollonius' usual dexterity in the manipulation of images and a determination to suggest not similarity but an ironic dissimilarity in Medea's situation: 1. The bride weeps over a husband whom death has carried off. Medea weeps over a stranger, whom she has no hope of marrying. 2. The bride mourns that they never had the opportunity to enjoy love; Medea because they will never have the opportunity. 3. The bride's family gave her to the groom; Medea's father will never give her to Jason. 4. The bride does not dare to face her handmaidens for fear that they will revile her appearing publicly after she has been widowed. Medea does not dare to face them, because she does not want inadvertently to reveal her daydreams. 1 Latin explorations (London 1963), p. 170-174. 2 Ed., Apollonius Rhodius, the story of Medea (Cambridge 1927), p. xiii.</page><page sequence="3">312 JERRY CLACK The frustration and despair of Medea is built on a series of ironies. Medea would like to be a bride. She displays all the symptoms and feelings of the widowed bride, but she remains only the unrequited lover. 3.744-750. Although the following passage describing Medea is not a simile, it is one of the finest passages in the Argonautica and stands sorely in need of defense. It is a description of night which has gained major attention because it was later adapted by Vergil (Aen. 4.522-529) to contrast the peace of the night (Nox erat et placidum carpebant fessa soporem/Corpora per terras, silvaeque et saeva quierant/Aequora ... ) with Dido's sleeplessness (At non infelix animi Phoenissa ... ). Such, however, was not Apollonius' intention. His description of night is this: N)~ pC'y J6rTeT ' Ci yaiav WYC1v KviOaC, ot 5' ~v i 7TOvrTw vaTrcu etLC 'EXiK?7V re K at aarTpaq 'Zptwivoc c6paxov 6K m1-7 " 7TVOto 6C K aG '0L bi6rT77 "Sr7 K ai rvXawp c bA6Cbro.

The degree to which this passage is misunderstood is plain from the remarks which most editors make about it. G. W. Mooney3 states that "this beautiful description of night has been elaborated by Vergil." Crees and Wordsworth point out, "With Apollonius the human interest prevails, while the [Vergilian] passage.., .describes the silence of all Nature at night, without any particular reference to mankind."4 They add: "One would have expected Vergil to make use of the most effective touch introduced by Apollonius: Kait rwa iralS6wv pll7pa TeVeCTr7CV SZwOv ep icEPt KWx/I CKaXVUTTrv." Editors have read this passage through Vergilian eyes, thereby doing injustice to both Apollonius and Vergil. Vergil was scarcely lacking in originality, nor was it ever his intention to "imitate" Apollonius. The passage which begins "Nox erat is evocative of Apollonius only so far as it serves Vergil's intention to use the masterpieces of the past to give resonance to his own work. Vergil does make of Apollonius' poetry a "beautiful description of the night." But Apollonius' lines are quite different. They are a depressing and haunting description of the anxieties which darkness brings. The sailors on the sea keep their eyes fixed on the Great Dipper, for fear that they will lose their way, and on Orion, whose setting means the coming of storms. Every weary traveller and gatekeeper longs for sleep. The grieving mother finally succumbs to exhaustion. Underscoring the un- easiness and loneliness, not even a dog's bark can be heard, not even the echo of a sound. Medea's frame of mind is no contrast to this night. They are the same. 3.755-760. Several lines beyond the previous passage appears a simile which has also gained considerable fame through the use Vergil makes of it in Aeneid 8.22-25, when he compares Aeneas' shifting thoughts to the quivering reflection of a sunbeam on the wall. The original simile is used by Apollonius to describe the dancing of Medea's heart and runs this way: 3 Ed., Apollonius Rhodius, "Argonautica" (Amsterdam 1964), p. 264. 4 Op. cit., p. 68.</page><page sequence="4">THE MEDEA SIMILES OF APOLLONIUS RHODIUS 313 rvKva 8e o&amp; Kpail oaryOdeov EvroaOev Gvutev, e7Xov W~ riC re 86o bUTrdXXeraL aXrl 66aro-T qavto6ua, r6 8 i1viov d X jfrrt i7T nov Ev &amp;yavXc KiXvuratL- t 8' &amp;v0a Kai av0a coK'cel UrpoLXLyyt Ttrwdeaerat &amp;hdioovUaa- ce 56 'at ~Pv or76eoUt Kdap eXehiteroT Kotpo . Apollonius' image is infinitely superior to Vergil's since the comparison of Aeneas' presumably orderly, though swift, consideration of alternatives does not square so well with the disorderly reflection of light on a wall as Medea's uncontrollable excitement does. The poet's technique is an interesting one, for it recalls a recurring phenomenon in Alexandrian poetry-that of purposely confusing the impressions of the senses. Here a visual image is used to describe a purely sensory reaction. The equation of Medea's excitement with shimmering light adds a feeling of elation to the feelings which the poet is describing. The irregular reflection of light on a house wall is a visualization of the fluttering of her heart. The second half of the fourth line is effectively ambiguous. At first reading, it would seem natural that i7 6' EvOa Kai aivOa refers to Medea. In 3.651 Apollonius had said that her feet bore her 'v6a Kai c vOa. It is only in the sixth line, with the conclusion of the simile, that we realize that i1 6' refers not to Medea but to ai'y7fr in the second line. By this ambiguity Apollonius has welded together the simile and the narrative. 3.956-961: abrdap b0' ob Iperd 677P6V CeXS6OIIe ?adpvOrl bi6do' avaTpda0 wv a te p2Etpto' 'h2Keavoo, cq.6r' 7Ot KraXoq 1eV 'pL arX 7-X T' Cut6kOat wriTXXet, tl Xotut b iKE v doVerov V e bt~ov.' dce bipa r,?

Homer says that Athene inspired Diomedes with daring and made his shield "glow with a blaze as steady as the Star of Summer when he rises from his bath in ocean to outshine all other stars." Here Jason seems to appear as suddenly before the eyes of Medea as Sirius rises in midsummer. To Medea their brightness and radiance are the same. But the significance of the simile is that Jason brings ruin to Medea in the very same way that the Dog Star brings it to the flocks and fields. They will both perish from the thirst, one for water, one for love. 3.967-971: rCj 8' a iv Kati &amp;avSot ePedouaoav j XXl XotLw, 17 6puoiv, 7 lpaxpi ow et-td evot XkaTLow, at' re 7rapUoooV CKrlXOt '&amp;P oLpeotVw pptcwvrat, v7?vII1 " etL 6' abrtV0 b r vtril cwLoto KW P4erVat bjdi?uav &amp;relpTroV - This simile found favor with both Catullus (64) and Valerius Flaccus (Argonautica 7.403-406). It is constructed in such a way that we are both observers and participants in the interview between Jason and Medea. The first impression is a visual one which the handmaidens experience as they perceive the hero and heroine standing together at a distance silhouetted against the sky. When they finally speak, they speak excitedly, but their words are as indistinct as the rustling of leaves. Close scrutiny of the simile</page><page sequence="5">314 JERRY CLACK reveals that Apollonius is also showing us the psychological reaction of Jason and Medea to one another. They are at first breathless and unable to begin a conversation. When they do at last begin to speak, they cannot restrain themselves and they talk as ceaselessly as the rustling of the leaves. 3.1018-1021. The prototype of the following simile can be found in Iliad 22.597-598, where Homer describes how Antilochus, yielding in a race at the funeral games for Patroclus, warms Menelaus' heart by his manliness. Apollonius uses the same image in an unashamedly romantic context: T7Wr 6' hpapvw&amp;' bOcOaklwv i 7jp7Ta/ev i. taiveo 6&amp; OpEvc' C'iaco T7KO/JClWI, odv 're 7ept 5obSdtW i0dpo7 7ET. 77Cat ot0ow 'tatGvopev OaWe arotv. As in the former simile, Apollonius is portraying an emotional state and a visual image at the same time. We are left with two impressions. The first is that Medea's heart warms with the coming of love, as a rose's petals grow warm under the touch of the morning sun. The second is an inevitable physical comparison of the dew drying on the soft petals of the rose, just as the tears have dried on Medea's radiant and blushing cheeks. 4.35-40. The final simile dealing with Medea's courtship takes us out of the sphere of her romance into the dark and bitter world of reality: o'll 7' 4Ovetloo 5tctXvvaOcaca 6.oolo X771dC, v 7TE V1eov Tad7rpT7 cd7r euvdotOevv aioa, o086 v r.wo poyepoio nrCerep77ra KapdTroLo, atXX' E' &amp;dOTao ovo a &amp;86T7 Kal t68ovLa pya eLolv a7V?OPEl7 xaXaeTdb TndTo Xyipaq &amp;vdoora77 TOi77 ap' tpepoecoa 6daPv ~vo oVT Ko6prl. On the primary level the simile compares the flight of two women. But the over- tones are equally strong. Medea is as unaware of the grievous toils love will bring her as the captive is unacquainted with the yoke of servitude. They are captives of a cruel mistress or master. In Medea's case it is love. Fate and misadventure snatch them both from the home of their father. Both flee shivering and afraid. The importance of passages such as these cannot be overemphasized. Even as re- gards such a basic poetic device as the simile, the Argonautica is the only substantial source we have in the entire span of Alexandrian literature. There is nothing to equal it until we meet the Latin writers of the late Roman republic and the early empire. Apollonius' similes would not perhaps be so extraordinary if there were a body of contemporary epic poetry with which they might be compared. As they stand, they are intensely interesting on two counts. The first-regardless of any arguments which might be put forth to the contrary-is that these similes (and the Argonautica as a whole) are the work of an epicist and therefore a conservative, as opposed, say, to an innovator like Callimachus. Whatever the reason for the infamous literary quarrel between Apollonius and Callimachus may have been, the scandal seems to have been that Apollonius, who represented the generally-held view, was worsted and literally took to his heels. And yet, as the work of a conservative, these similes of his are so far removed in handling and context from the narrative similes of Homer that one's</page><page sequence="6">THE MEDEA SIMILES OF APOLLONIUS RHODIUS 315 curiosity over the work of the supposed innovators is unbounded. Secondly, the similes, along with the remainder of the Argonautica, are important in themselves, because they mark the first firm entrenchment of the romantic spirit in ancient literature and, as such, are the beginning of one of the most successful currents in Western writing.
