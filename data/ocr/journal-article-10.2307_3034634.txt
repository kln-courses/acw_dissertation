<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHAT MAKES ANTHROPOMORPHISM NATURAL: INTUITIVE ONTOLOGY AND CULTURAL REPRESENTATIONS PASCAL BOYER Centre National de la Recherche Scienttflque The projection of human attributes onto non-human domains is often explained in anthro- pology as the consequence of a tendency to animism and anthropomorphism present from the earliest stages of cognitive development. However, the experimental evidence suggests that intuitive ontological principles exclude such projections. So anthropomorphism, though wide- spread, is counter-intuitive. This apparent paradox can be solved by means of a cognitive theory of cultural representations, in which representations are likely to become stable and widespread if they have both salience and inferential potential. Anthropomorphic projections have inferential potential because they activate a powerful modular capacity for mentalistic accounts of behaviour. They are salient because they are counter-intuitive, and therefore attention-grabbing. Introduction In most cultural environments, one finds representations concerning the life- like and human-like features of non-living or non-human objects: trees that protect people in exchange for sacrifices, animals that have marriage ceremonies or funerary rituals, mountains that breathe, rivers that talk, statues that listen or divining wands that predict future occurrences, not to mention gods who have meals and fall in love or spirits that live in invisible villages. Such repre- sentations are central to religious ontologies, although they are certainly not limited to the religious domain. The problem, then, is to provide a precise description of the cognitive processes that make animistic and anthropomorphic assumptions so 'natural'. There is no clear, psychologically plausible answer to this question in anthropology, despite a long tradition of reflection on animism as a core process in religion. In this article I discuss the widespread theory that people have a spontaneous tendency to extend human attributes to non-human domains, a tendency that can be observed in an especially clear way in children's thought processes. The Piagetian tradition in particular described the child as applying an overwhelm- ingly 'animistic' concept of causation even to mechanical effects. Children were also described as interpreting many events in clearly anthropomorphic ways. Four-year-olds, for instance, seem to use an intentional vocabulary to account for the course of the clouds in the sky: the clouds 'want to go' somewhere or 'want to stay put' (Laurendau &amp; Pinard 1962). All this would indicate that the child makes extensive use of a default assumption that things are alive and J. Roy. anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 2, 83-97</page><page sequence="2">84 PASCAL BOYER intentional unless there is direct evidence that they are not. If this is the case, it would seem that the widespread occurrence of such representations is hardly surprising. It is just the expression of a 'mode of thought' pervasive in children's thinking.1 According to this 'continuity' hypothesis, anthropomorphism is wide- spread because it is intuitive. As we will see, however, the experimental evidence seems to go against this hypothesis. Indeed, developmental studies show that spontaneous ontologies clearly exclude, from an early age, the animistic and anthropomorphic projections we are considering here. So we need to describe the cognitive processes whereby representations which are not part of our intuitive ontology, and in fact go against the grain of intuitive ontology, become culturally widespread. The solu- tion to this apparent paradox will illustrate the relevance of a general framework presented elsewhere (Boyer 1994), according to which universal cognitive dis- positions account for the cross-cultural recurrence of certain kinds of representations. The evidence: anthropomorphism as counter-intuitive In order to understand what is implied by 'childhood animism' or anthropo- morphism, it is necessary to have a broader picture of the child's ontology, particularly of the intuitive ontological categories and principles with which chil- dren and adults construe their experience and make inferences. In the last twenty years, the topic has seen considerable advances, both in terms of experi- mental techniques and of theoretical frameworks. On the whole, the evidence seems to cast doubt on several important assumptions of the Piagetian ap- proach. In particular, there is now considerable evidence that (i) ontological categories are clearly represented from the earliest stages of conceptual develop- ment, and (ii) even young children acquire knowledge on the basis of quasi-theoretical understandings of the various ontological domains. Let me first consider ontological distinctions between such domains as PERSONS, ARTEFACTS, ANIMATE BEINGS, EVENTS and ABSTRACT OBJECTS. Beyond the clear distinctions between con-specifics and other types of beings, and be- tween different con-specifics (Morton &amp; Johnson 1991), infants seem to make a distinction between ANIMATE and INANIMATE objects (Bullock 1985; Gelman et at. 1983; Richards &amp; Siegler 1986). This ability is probably grounded in an early sensitivity to the perceptual difference between self- and non-self-gener- ated movement in physical objects (Massey &amp; Gelman 1988). Also, Mandler and her colleagues have demonstrated the existence of a variety of ontological categories such as PLANTS and ARTEFACTS in eighteenth-month-old children (Mandler &amp; Bauer 1989; Mandler et al. 1991). At a later stage of development, Keil's experiments have shown that pre-schoolers make use of a complex hier- archy of tacit ontological distinctions (Keil 1979; 1986; 1989). This is manifest, for instance, in 'predicate-spanning'; if the application of a given predicate is relevant to a certain object, it allows us to predict the possibility of applying other predicates to that object. As Keil's studies have shown, pre-schoolers spontaneously use such predicate restrictions to make inferences concerning imaginary objects they know nothing about. Experiments, for instance, show that young children are confident that an imaginary item, described as 'sleepy' may well be 'furious', but that it certainly cannot be 'made of metal'.</page><page sequence="3">PASCAL BOYER 85 Having an ontological category is not just a matter of selecting the right cues that sort objects in different conceptual slots; it also implies having particular assumptions about what makes the objects different. In this domain, a number of recent studies have emphasized the richness and early development of domain-specific principles that are in some important respects under-determined by the child's experience (for a general survey, see Hirschfeld &amp; Gelman 1994). In the domain of physical expectations, developmental research has shown that many of the principles underlying adult intuitive expectations appear very early in cognitive development. Infants, for instance, expect solid objects to behave according to continuity (objects move in continuous paths), solidity (objects do not coincide in space) (Baillargeon 1987; Baillargeon &amp; Hanko-Summers 1990), and support (unsupported objects fall downwards) (Spelke 1990). More- over, infants are sensitive to differences in contiguous events, particularly between causal and non-causal versions of contiguous physical events; they also hold a principle of 'no action at a distance' (Leslie 1988). Similar advances have been made in the description of specialized principles underlying expectations about the biological features of living kinds. From the earliest age, as we saw above, there is a categorical distinction between ANIMATE and INANIMATE objects. This distinction is then enriched with a variety of specific intuitive principles which describe biological aspects of live beings. The identification of living kinds activates an 'essentialist principle' according to which an undefined internal principle, exclusive to the species, causes its exter- nal features as well as certain aspects of its behaviour.2 These theoretical assumptions are also manifest in children's resistance to the possibility of an artificial transformation of one living kind into another (Keil 1986). Another set of intuitive principles is found in the intentional explanation of behaviour, Young children readily interpret the behaviour of animate beings, particularly persons, in terms of the causal role of unobservable entities such as beliefs and intentions. This requires a series of tacit principles about the nature of mental entities and their connexions with observable action (see for instance Astington et al. 1988; Perner 1991; Wellmann 1990; Whiten 1991). Beliefs and desires are represented as immaterial from the age of three (Wellmann &amp; Estes 1986). At the same age, children have a rudimentary understanding of the causal connexions between states of affairs and mental representations. They under- stand that perceptions routinely cause beliefs which may cause intentions which may result in actions, whilst the reverse causal links are non-standard. They also understand, around the age of four, the possibility of mental representations misrepresenting actual states of affairs, as well as the behavioural implications of false belief (see Wimmer &amp; Perner 1983 for the original findings). All these principles form the basis of intentional explanations. Of course, children sub- sequently acquire vastly more complex notions about mental processes and behaviour. Yet these never contradict the fundamental principles observed in five-year-olds. The combination of ontological categories and domain-specific principles provides the child (and the adult) with an intuitive ontology, and the correspond- ing set of specific expectations about various aspects of the environment. In most domains, these intuitive principles are under-determined by experience. Obviously, knowledge structures could not be developed without the trigger</page><page sequence="4">86 PASCAL BOYER provided by external stimuli. No child will ever develop an understanding of intentional action unless he or she is in constant interaction with intentional beings; no understanding of biological properties could develop in a environ- ment that did not include live beings. However, the child's early or intuitive 'theories' go far beyond the information given, and are structured, from an early age, by complex, quasi-theoretical prior assumptions about the different prop- erties of different ontological domains. Under-determination by experience entails under-determination by cultural input, which is only a subset of the child's experience. Indeed, the principles underlying intuitive ontology can be found in a similar form in the most diverse cultural environments. For instance, Walker found a similar developmental schedule for aspects of ontological development in Yoruba and American chil- dren (Walker 1985; 1992). Or again, the principles of taxonomic ordering and essentialist understanding of living things are represented in similar ways the world over (Atran 1990). The understanding of mental processes and inten- tional action, which after all would seem to depend most on particular features of social interactions, is seen to undergo the same developmental phases in Cameroon Pygmy and British children (Avis &amp; Harris 1991). To sum up, the content and developmental schedule of ontological categories and domain-specific principles seem to be the outcome of maturational pro- grammes triggered, but not shaped, by experiential input. This may explain their remarkable consistency in vastly different cultural environments. There are good evolutionary arguments for assuming that natural selection would have equipped human minds with a variety of domain-specific conceptual ca- pacities, each carrying strong prior assumptions about its domain of application, rather than an all-purpose and unconstrained form of general intelligence (Barkow et al. 1992). Human beings are remarkable in their capacity to learn, that is, to acquire information stored in the natural and social environment. This is precisely why they need more complex prior assumptions than other species. The capacity to learn is the capacity to make specific inferences on the basis of cues present in the environment; it requires a capacity to recognize relevant cues against a background, and to constrain the range of possible infer- ences from those cues. This is where a range of specialized, quasi-theoretical prior principles is obviously superior in computational terms to unconstrained forms of general intelligence, which would compute indefinitely many infer- ences on the basis of indefinitely many irrelevant aspects of the environment. Such evolutionary considerations may also account for the obvious differ- ences between the domain-specific 'modules' described above. There is, for instance, a striking contrast between the inferential potential of intuitive psy- chological principles (our intuitive 'belief-desire' interpretation of behaviour) and all other domain-specific principles. The inferences and predictions pro- duced by what psychologists describe as a 'theory of mind module' are, from the earliest stages of development, far more complex than any other conceptual structure. Also, the 'theory of mind module' postulates the existence of imma- terial causative entities (beliefs and intentions) from the outset, whilst other conceptual structures only gradually build such representations of underlying causative processes. Some authors have speculated on the evolutionary causes of this 'hypertrophy' of the theory of mind module. What is clear is that such a</page><page sequence="5">PASCAL BOYER 87 richly structured set of assumptions is necessary for verbal communication (Sperber &amp; Wilson 1986), as well as for cultural acquisition in general (Tomasello et al. 1993). A general conclusion from the studies I have mentioned is that there is no such thing as a categorical 'confusion' or spontaneous over-extension in the child's ontology. Live things are not artefacts, persons and plants are not the same, events and abstract objects are different. The child applies to ontological categories a set of particular quasi-theoretical principles which do not result in category mistakes. For instance, the child's biological assumptions about physi- ological processes only develop gradually; but the central principles on which they are based, such as the principle of 'essentialism' regarding living things, are generally not applied to non-living objects. These studies have led most devel- opmental psychologists to conclude that 'childhood animism' is to a large extent an illusion (Bullock 1985), based on various experimental artefacts. For one thing, many early experiments (Piaget's in particular) focused on children's explicit categories; for example, on their understanding of what can be said to be 'alive' or not. In this domain as in many others, the child's knowledge of the appropriate linguistic categories lags far behind his or her intuitive distinctions. Also, most evidence for animism or anthropomorphism comes from the child's inferences about categories for which he or she has virtually no conceptual knowledge at all (see Laurendau &amp; Pinard's [1962] experiments on young chil- dren's ideas about clouds). A third factor that may have created the illusion is the fact that the imaginary world of children is full of animistic, anthropomor- phic and magical assumptions. This, however, should not be taken as a direct expression of the child's intuitive expectations; on the contrary, the evidence shows that children have an early appreciation of the non-standard nature of such speculations (Rosengren et al. 1994). Anthropomorphism as a paradox The psychological evidence summarized here has consequences for our anthro- pological interpretation of animism and anthropomorphism. In particular, I will emphasize two important points. First, animism and anthropomorphism cannot be construed as 'intuitive', as emerging naturally from intuitive ontology. Sec- ond, anthropomorphism and animism are not based on a unitary cognitive phenomenon, but on a host of domain-specific projections. These are not all cognitively equal; there is a definite hierarchy of psychological salience, with consequences for cultural recurrence. Anthropological descriptions often leave their psychological aspects implicit, or describe them in terms of common-sense understandings of the mind. In either case, a more precise description of the cognitive processes involved is needed. Consider for instance Ellen's statement, that there is a general tendency in human relations with the inanimate world to attribute and represent that world in organic terms, and to attribute inanimate objects with the properties of living things. There is nothing particularly mysterious about this [... .] It happens because we are bound to model our world directly on those experiences which are most immediate, and these are experiences of our own body (Ellen 1988: 231). This interpretation may seem plausible, yet its translation in precise cognitive terms is fraught with difficulties. People in many groups extend a vitalistic</page><page sequence="6">88 PASCAL BOYER conception of life to mountains or rivers. What they extend is not an 'immedi- ate' or private experience of having (or rather being) a body, but the mental representations that describe and explain that private experience. They project domain-specific biological principles which specify, for instance, that live things are born and grow, that they have physiological processes, that they have an enduring identity despite external changes, and so on. Now, there is no precise empirical sense in which these principles of intuitive biology should be de- scribed as more 'immediate' than principles of intuitive physics or intuitive psychology. On the contrary, the psychological evidence suggests that sophisti- cated understandings of biological processes are constructed later than mechanical or intentional principles, and partly on the basis of the latter (Carey 1985). The plausibility of an explanation in terms of immediacy or familiarity disappears if we take into account the actual functioning of intuitive ontological principles. Against this common explanation in terms of 'immediacy' or familiarity, Guthrie (1993) has put forward a sophisticated explanation of anthropomorphic projections based on precise psychological assumptions. VWhilst common sense would suggest that anthropomorphic projections aim for a simpltfted or more familiar way of representing the world, Guthrie contends that they are wide- spread because they impose a more complex organization on the available stimuli. The aim of Guthrie's theory is to give a general characterization of the cognitive underpinnings of religious representations through an account of what is con- ceived as their central feature, namely anthropomorphic projections. The argument proceeds in three steps. First, Guthrie argues that all perception and identification is inferential, that is, they produce interpretations by adding infor- mation to a perceptual input, by way of non-demonstrative inferences; this applies all the way from low-level perception such as recognizing shapes and volumes in the environment, to higher-level organization (for instance, ascrib- ing a conceptual identification to objects perceived, and making inferences about their unobservable properties). Second, perceptual and conceptual infer- ences tend to ascribe to a given set of stimuli the highest level of organization compatible with the stimuli considered. Third, there is a specific hierarchy of complexity or organization among the intuitive theories or assumptions we have about different ontological domains. All physical objects are perceived as constrained by intuitive principles that govern their position in space, and their reactions to pushing and pulling (see below). Some objects are conceived as more complex or more organized, in that they are alive; some of their features cannot be interpreted only in physical terms but require an additional level of conceptual structure to do with such processes as reproduction, growth or decay. Some of these live objects are conceived as intentional and therefore require yet another set of concepts to interpret their behaviour in terms of perceptions, beliefs and intentions. These hypotheses imply that people will ascribe as much living organization (and as much intentionality) to the objects perceived as is compatible with the stimuli. This accounts for our 'standard' perception of animals as alive, or people as intentional. For Guthrie, the process also applies to all sorts of objects whose features do not directly exclude such interpretations. This is why we may in some circumstances see life in a car or intentionality in plants and computers.</page><page sequence="7">PASCAL BOYER 89 Guthrie's model is certainly more sophisticated than explanations given in terms of 'immediacy' or familiarity. There are, however, some uncertainties in this argument. In particular, Guthrie's use of such notions as 'complexity' and 'significance' is not entirely clear. Significance in representations is described as a function of the complexity of the object represented: 'an organism typically is more significant than is inorganic matter' (1993: 61). Now it may be true that living things display, from a certain point of view, a higher degree of organiza- tion than other objects, but this does not entail that thoughts about living things are more complex than thoughts about inanimate objects. It may be the case, but in the absence of independent evidence, the notion of 'complexity' as a major factor in directing people's inferences may be entirely ad hoc.3 More importantly, Guthrie's account, as with common anthropological hy- potheses about the phenomenon, is founded on a 'continuity' hypothesis that just does not fit the psychological evidence. Experimental studies demonstrate the stability and clear boundaries of, and definite inferential differences be- tween, such categories as PERSON and ARTEFACT, or ANIMATE and INANIMATE. From the earliest stages of conceptual development, the projection of animate characteristics onto inanimate objects is counter-intuitive (in the precise sense of the term); inasmuch as children (and adults) entertain such representations, they entertain them as salient counterfactual speculations. This simple and clearly demonstrated result should put an end to primitivist speculations ac- cording to which various features of religious or, more generally, symbolic, thought consist in a return to some early stage of cognitive development. There is no such thing as early animism and anthropomorphism, and therefore noth- ing to 'return' to. These results lead to an apparent paradox. Animistic and anthropomorphic assumptions are pervasive in cultural representations. It makes sense to assume that this is at least partly due to universal cognitive dispositions. As it happens, however, intuitive ontology is not pervaded by animistic or anthropomorphic assumptions. It may, therefore, seem that the whole project of explaining an- thropomorphism in terms of early cognitive constraints is doomed. In fact, this paradox stems from an inadequate description of the cultural representations in question. There is an alternative explanation which is consistent with the psy- chological evidence and will be described below. The centrality of intentional projections Before turning to a cognitive account of 'anthropomorphism' and 'animism', we must establish precisely what projections are culturally recurrent. This is why we must return briefly to the question of domain-specificity. From a cog- nitive viewpoint, many common anthropological notions are just too vague or general to be empirically significant. This is the case, for instance, with the common description of anthropomorphism as 'projecting the human onto the non-human'. There are indefinitely many aspects under which humans are construed as different from non-humans, and there are equally many possible projections. Consider the following: (i) anatomical structure: There are examples the world over of features of the landscape described in terms of their resemblance with parts or aspects of the human body.</page><page sequence="8">90 PASCAL BOYER (ii) physiological processes: The Aymara of Bolivia, for instance, say that the mountain where they live is a living organism, which breathes and must be fed (Bastien 1978). Consider also the countless cases of gods or spirits said to take meals, have children, and so forth. (iii) personal identity: Compare, for instance, religious systems in which 'the spirits' or 'the ancestors' are treated as a collective agency, with those systems that recognize a number of identified agencies, each with his or her specific powers, likes and dislikes, and personal history. (iv) social organization: In many cultural environments, spirits or animals are said to live in villages, to have social hierarchies and other features of human social life. (v) intentional psychology: This is the most common projection. Intentionality is routinely projected onto all sorts of ontological categories, and not just catego- ries of quasi-human agents. See, for instance, James's description of 'listening ebony' divination among the Uduk of Sudan. Here, certain trees are said to overhear and record conversations between people James 1988). The list is far from exhaustive, but shows that such terms as animism and anthropomorphism (and one may add 'vitalism', 'personification' and other similar concepts) are not of much use in a psychological description of these cultural representations. The terms are misleading in that they ignore the po- tential cognitive diversity of projections, that is, the fact that projections of different features are based on significantly different cognitive mechanisms. As I said above, a consistent finding of developmental psychology is that different domains are structured by functionally different principles. It is therefore not really plausible that projecting human intentional psychology onto a ship re- quires the same cognitive processes as projecting human anatomical structure onto a landscape. So the question should be addressed at a lower level of abstraction than is generally the case in anthropology; the projections should be described in a way that makes it possible to identify precisely the source do- mains, the types of representations that structure them, and their effects on the target domains. By not paying enough attention to domain-specificity, we may misconstrue the distribution of different anthropomorphic projections. In particular, we may be over-impressed by certain 'explicit' projections, and neglect far more recur- rent 'tacit' ones. This is in my view a crucial flaw in Guthrie's otherwise impressive survey Guthrie's book gives many examples of anthropomorphic projections from the most diverse cultural environments and in the most di- verse domains of cultural representations. The accumulation of examples might give the impression that all aspects of human existence are equally likely to be projected onto non-human domains. I want to argue that this is not the case. There is a definite hierarchy of projection. Projections of psychological proper- ties are more fundamental in the sense that they are almost invariably entailed by other projections, whilst the converse is not always the case. To illustrate this, let me give a brief example taken from Keesing's (1982) description of Kwaio religion. Ancestors are a particular kind of agent in that they are invisible and can be in various places at the same time, two features which Keesing's informants mention as their main difference from humans. Ancestors have exceptional perceptual capacities, as well as magical powers: they</page><page sequence="9">PASCAL BOYER 91 may cause one to stumble in the forest, or put snakes in one's path. Ancestors can also 'mana-ize' people, thus ensuring success (Keesing 1982: 43-4). As Keesing points out, there is little consensus about the process whereby the mind or 'life' of living people is turned into ancestral presence: hypotheses about this are 'inconsistent, contradictory and variable among individuals' (1982: 105). Another set of assumptions, however, is the object of a complete consensus, although it remains tacit in Kwaio discourse and Keesing only de- scribes it by implication. Ancestors and other kinds of spirits are represented as having perceptions which are caused by actual states of affairs; as having beliefs that result from those perceptions; as having intentions based on their beliefs, and so on. They are also described as having complex plans based on their perception of other people's beliefs. Keesing gives many examples of 'negotia- tions' with ancestors which require such assumptions. For instance a pig may be sacrificed to some ancestor in order to cure a child's illness; but the sacrifice is in vain if the pig is not 'given' to the particular ancestor who caused the illness (1982: 115). The situation is represented by the participants as one in which an ancestor knows that a child has violated a prohibition, wants to get a sacrificed pig and causes the child's illness because he expects that the child's family will infer that this is what he wants. In other words, all intuitive principles of the intuitive 'theory of mind' are tacitly projected onto the ancestors. Obviously, this is not confined to Kwaio ancestors. It is probably the most common feature of all such conceptions; spirits, gods, ancestors and so forth are generally described as having very special physical or biological properties. Be- yond these explicit descriptions, they are invariably construed as intentional agents, to whom all intuitive assumptions about thought and perception apply This form of anthropomorphism is tacit because the principles used are self-evident to the people concerned. For the same reason, it is rarely if ever commented on in anthropological descriptions. Let us now consider the contrast between projections of intentional psycho- logy and projections of human physical features. In this latter category we can include all representations based on visual cues of human form, such as moun- tains or clouds with human faces or bodies. In a cliche of the classical Western tradition, the god Eole is represented as a cloud with a human face, who blows winds towards the earth. The same category also includes representations of typically human activities or interaction. There is a striking asymmetry between these two types of anthropomorphic projections. The physical features of Eole's human-like face do not just provide perceptual information about the god's putative anatomy, but also indicate that the god is looking somewhere, and can presumably perceive what he is looking at. They also imply that he is blowing the wind somewhere because of his intention to do so.4 This point applies in fact to most anthropomorphic representations in art, and Guthrie's rich iconography provides many illustrations of the phenomenon.5 This is particularly striking if we remember that the converse process is far less common. That is to say, people who project intentional psychology most often do not bother to project other features of the human domain onto the target domain. Religious systems the world over include some projection of intentional psychology onto putative agents such as spirits or ancestors. Now, in very few of these cultural environments could one find specific assumptions</page><page sequence="10">92 PASCAL BOYER about the physical similarity between spirits and humans. Whether spirits have limbs, or whether their digestion works in the same way as for humans, whether their bodies have weight, and so on, are all questions generally left to individual speculation, and in fact are rarely if ever speculated upon. To sum up, projections of human physical features in general result in a projection, tacit or not, of intentional psychology; but a projection of intentional psychology does not generally entail a projection of any other human quality. The question of anthropomorphic projections, then, may be more specific than is usually sug- gested. The problem is to explain, not general projections of the human onto the non-human, but projections of intuitive belief-desire psychology onto non- intentional objects. Intuitive ontology and religious assumptions We can now return to the 'paradox' of anthropomorphism. Some projections are culturally widespread (mostly in the tacit form described above), yet psy- chological evidence shows that they are not part of an intuitive or spontaneous way of representing the world. To show that this is not really paradoxical, I will use an explanatory framework I have presented in more detail elsewhere (Boyer 1994), to account for the spread or transmission of religious representations in general. The starting point of this account is the importance of cultural selection. Cul- tural representations are constantly created or modified in individual minds by virtue of a variety of contingent factors. There is no reason to think that similar representations occur for similar reasons, and that their occurrence is amenable to a single explanation. On the other hand, not all mental representations are equally likely to be transmitted. Some general constraints or dispositions make certain types of representations more likely than others to be acquired, stored and transmitted. All else being equal, one should expect the occurrence of such representations, over many cycles of acquisition and transmission, to constitute the roughly stable and roughly shared sets of representations anthropologists call 'cultural'. Intuitive ontological principles result in a series of stable expectations about the behaviour, aspect, internal structures and processes of such things as artefacts, plants, persons or animals. Now, the central tenets of most religious systems generally consist in claims that violate these intuitive expectations and postulate counter-intuitive properties for a variety of agents or entities. Given a certain ontological category, counter-intuitive assumptions can be produced either by violating intuitive expectations concerning that category, or by transferring a range of expectations that do not intuitively apply to the category. The first case is illustrated by concepts of spirits and other such agents with counter-intuitive physical properties. An example of transfer can be found in the Aymara body- mountain described above; here, counter-intuitive assumptions are produced by transferring assumptions from intuitive biological principles to the domain of non-living natural objects. Other examples of transfer can be observed when statues are said to have biological processes (they feed on sacrifices) or inten- tionality (they listen to prayers). Religious ontological assumptions are counter-intuitive in the precise sense that they violate intuitive ontological expectations delivered by domain-specific principles.</page><page sequence="11">PASCAL BOYER 93 I must insist on this point, given the ambiguity of the term 'counter-intuitive' in ordinary usage. First, this counter-intuitive quality is not necessarily related to people's explicit theories about such things as 'nature' or 'reality' (if they hold any such explicit conceptions). This is because intuitive ontology delivers ex- pectations, not theoretical justifications for these expectations. Also, what is counter-intuitive from a cognitive viewpoint is not necessarily perceived as unfamiliar. The familiarity of particular representations and their counter-intui- tive quality are independent properties. Some counter-intuitive religious assumptions can become totally routinized; for instance no-one in the West would find it terribly surprising to be told that ghosts can walk through walls. However banal the assumption that ghosts can walk through walls, it still vio- lates intuitive principles concerning the behaviour of solid objects and the premiss that agents are solid physical objects. Finally, one should not confuse the counter-intuitive and the unreal. People may be convinced of the actuality of some counter-intuitive phenomenon; this does not make it less counter- intuitive in the precise sense used here. On the contrary, the fact that religious assumptions are perceived as counter-intuitive and construed as actually true is probably an important factor in explaining why they trigger significant cognitive investment on the part of the people concerned. Counter-intuitive assumptions are indeed counter-intuitive to the people who hold them, and this is probably the main explanation of their attention-grabbing potential. My second hypothesis is that such counter-intuitive assumptions are not the only characteristic of religious representations. Indeed, representations consist- ing only of such counter-intuitive assumptions are unlikely to 'survive' cycles of transmission. What is necessary is a background of additional assumptions which are not counter-intuitive and in fact are directly provided by intuitive ontological expectations. The example of 'tacit anthropomorphism' described above illustrates this phenomenon. Spirits and ancestors are construed in terms that make them clearly counter-intuitive: their physical properties in particular make them a special class of agents, whose features mark them off from other, non-counter-intuitive agents such as persons and animals. At the same time, as I said, these assumptions are clearly insufficient for any inferences about spirits. In order to understand, explain or predict the spirits' behaviour, one needs a number of complex assumptions about their psychological processes. Now, these assumptions are not 'given' by cultural transmission; they are delivered by the tacit operation of intuitive psychology, that is, of the 'theory of mind' module. Once described in these cognitive terms, religious concepts appear to be constrained by intuitive ontologies in two different ways. First, religious repre- sentations would not be attention-grabbing if they did not include some counter-intuitive assumptions; but these are counter-intuitive only against a background of intuitive expectations. Second, religious representations invari- ably include a host of assumptions directly provided by intuitive ontologies, and these assumptions direct the inferences made about putative religious entities. This double constraint from intuitive ontology is necessary for the 'survival' of religious representations across cycles of transmission. Religious representations would probably not be acquired at all if their counter-intuitive aspects did not make them sufficiently salient to be an object of attention and cognitive investment.</page><page sequence="12">94 PASCAL BOYER Conversely, they would probably not be acquired and transmitted if their intui- tive component did not give them sufficient inferential potential. The number of such combinations should be very limited. Religious ontolo- gies do not consist in any odd combination of 'something counter-intuitive' and 'something intuitive'. I showed elsewhere that these constraints from intuitive ontology result in a very limited 'catalogue' of possible religious assumptions which, even including rather rare combinations, does not amount to more than fifteen combinations of ontological category and violation (or counter-intuitive transfer) of domain specific assumptions (Boyer forthcoming). Despite their apparent diversity, religious beliefs are in fact based on a very limited set of ontological assumptions. That is to say, most recurrent assumptions turn out to be based on one or several of the combinations predicted by my description of intuitive ontological expectations. Moreover, my description predicts that not all combinations will have the same potential for survival. This is because counter-intuitive assumptions have to be supplemented with an intuitive back- ground which makes it possible to derive inferences and expectations from the cultural input. Now, not all sets of domain-specific inferences are equally rich in their inferential potential. All else being equal, one should therefore expect combinations which make background use of rich inferential structures (such as intuitive psychology) to have more survival potential than combinations that make background use of more limited inferential structures (such as intuitive physics). The naturalness of anthropomorphism The cognitive account of religious ontologies presented here has one major consequence for our understanding of cultural transmission. It implies that religious ontologies need very little actual transmission in order to be repro- duced from generation to generation. All that is necessary for transmission is that people are given specific cues that indicate which aspects of their intuitive ontological expectations are violated by the religious entities postulated. Beyond this, the normal operation of all other principles of intuitive ontology (activated by default, since they are not violated) will be powerful enough to complete the representation of the religious entities. Because intuitive domain-specific prin- ciples are roughly similar in all human subjects, such cues normally result in roughly similar inferences in most of the subjects exposed to them, and should therefore produce roughly consistent versions of the local 'tradition'. All else being equal, the most locally stable (and therefore the cross-culturally most recurrent) cultural representations should be the ones for which this inferential process yields the richest domain of inferences, even from limited cultural cues. This is where the 'hypertrophy' of intentional inferences, mentioned in my description of the 'theory of mind' module, has crucial effects on the shape of religious representations. Cultural representations for which intentional psy- chology is used as tacit background should be more easily acquired than representations that do not allow this background use; they should therefore be more recurrent. This prediction is confirmed by two particular aspects of the actual distribution of types of religious ontologies. First, religious ontologies that postulate agencies with counter-intuitive physics or biology together with a tacit background of intuitive psychology, are widespread the world over. Indeed,</page><page sequence="13">PASCAL BOYER 95 they are so common that anthropologists after Tylor have often considered such a combination of assumptions as a constitutive feature of religious ontologies. Second, wherever there is an explicit hypothesis of entities which directly vio- late intuitive psychology, it is invariably complemented by assumptions that conform to the standard combination. This is the case for 'zombies', for in- stance. These are living human bodies whose description violates expectations about intentional processes, since they are said to have neither volition nor self-awareness. But zombies are also construed as controlled by some external agent (a spirit or a sorcerer) assumed to have intentional belief-desire psycho- logy. The same holds for possession; a person is represented as acting and talking without self-awareness, but under the control of some external agency However vaguely described, this agency is always construed as having psycho- logical processes that conform to intuitive psychology. These are well-known facts in the anthropology of religion. They can be easily interpreted, once we take into account the difference in inferential potential between intuitive psy- chology and other domains of intuitive expectations. This article began with a simple, perhaps naive question: what makes anthropo- morphic assumptions so 'natural'? Obviously, thinking trees, mountains and artefacts, as well as putative intentional agents such as spirits, can be conscripted to all sorts of intellectual, emotional or social purposes. But all these ways of using anthropomorphic assumptions require that the assumptions are made in the first place, and that they have sufficient attention-grabbing power and infer- ential potential. Projections of intuitive intentional psychology make use of the richest domain of inferences available to human minds, whilst violating central aspects of intuitive ontology. Anthropomorphism, then, is 'natural' and wide- spread mainly because it is counter-intuitive. NOTES Thanks are due to Michael Houseman, Carlo Severi, Simon Harrison and two anonymous reviewers who were patient enough to read a first, rather awkward version of this article and suggest many corrections. 1 This does not imply that people who hold anthropomorphic beliefs think like children; it only implies that they make use of cognitive resources, the entrenchment of which is made particularly clear by the fact that they appear very early in cognitive development. Hallpike (1979) has argued at length that 'primitive' mentality, supposedly characteristic of cognitive processes in low-technology groups, is formally similar to pre-operational stages in childhood. However, neither the anthropological evidence nor the psychological data are consistent with this description; see Boyer (1994) on this point, and a detailed discussion of Hallpike's assump- tions in Shweder (1982). 2 For instance, even pre-schoolers assume that membership of a kind is more important than observable features in predicting the typical behaviour of an unknown animal (Becker &amp; Ward 1991; Gelman &amp; Markman 1986; Massey &amp; Gelman 1988). Also, they assume that such kind- based inductive generalizations are more plausible if the properties projected are 'inherent' properties of the exemplars, such as ways of breathing and feeding, rather than weight or speed (Gelman &amp; Markman 1987; see also Gelman 1988). 3 In other passages of Guthrie's book, the link between complexity and significance is at times left aside and replaced with the very kind of intellectualist assumptions that a cognitive account should make redundant. Guthrie argues, for instance, that 'anthropomorphism may best be explained as the result of an attempt to see not what we want to see or what is easy to see, but what is imlportant to see: what may affect us for better or for worse' (1993: 82); or again: 'I believe we anthropomorphize because we perceive the world in terms of our interests,</page><page sequence="14">96 PASCAL BOYER which usually involve humans' (1993: 185). This, however, is dangerously close to a tautology; the only evidence for the 'importance' of particular thoughts is that we tend to have them more often. 4 These inferences may or may not be part of the artist's purpose, but this is irrelevant; they constitute assumptions which are likely to be activated, tacitly or not, by any human subject considering the picture. 5 For instance, a poster advertising cruises from New York represents two shapes on the bridge of a ship; the tall shapes readily identifiable as the Chrysler and Empire State buildings. But these shapes are also 'anthropomorphic', having some features of human bodies, and cues that evoke two formally-dressed persons, a man in a dinner-jacket and a woman in evening dress. Their position suggests that they are engaged in a conversation. Again, the visual cues here are likely to activate assumptions, not just about the anatomical structure of the imaginary entities, but also about psychological processes: looking, perceiving, listening, talking to some- one, etc. REFERENCES Astington, J.W, P Harris &amp; D.R.

Ce qui rend I'anthropomorphisme naturel: ontologie intuitive et representations culturelles R6sume II n'est pas rare que I'anthropologie explique la projection d'attributs humains sur des domaines non-humains comme la consequence d'une tendance 'a 'animisme et d'un type anthropo- morphisme que l'on retrouverait des les premiers stages du developpement cognitif. Mais les resultats experimentaux suggerent au contraire que la presence de principes ontologiques intuitifs devraient exclure de telles projections. Dans ce sens, I'antliropomorphisme, bien que tres repandu, est contre-intuitif. La th6orie cognitive des representations culturelles, qui postule que toute representation peut se repandre et se stabiliser si elle frappe l'imagination et facilite l'inference, permet d'expliquer ce paradoxe apparent. Les projections anthropo- morphiques ont un potentiel inferentiel eleve car elles activent une capacite modulaire puissante qui permet de se representer mentalement le comportement. Leur saillance est due au fait qu'elles sont contre-intuitives, et par la meme deconcertantes. Centre National de la Recherche Scientiflque, 14 avenue Bertlelot, 69363 Lyon, France</page></plain_text>
