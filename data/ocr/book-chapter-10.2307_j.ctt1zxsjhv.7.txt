<plain_text> <page sequence="1">   C h a p t e r  5 The Foundation Pit  Itself </page> <page sequence="2">  </page> <page sequence="3"> A note on Platonov’s title: because the word “pit” in some English  translations of the Bible appears as a synonym for hell or the  underworld (see, for example, Psalms 16:10 and 49:9), the English  title The Foundation Pit has a more ominous ring to it than does  the original Russian, Kotlovan. Because it is part of the vocabularly  of building, the word “kotlovan” has a more prospective ring to it.  It denotes the pit or hole in which the foundation for a building is  to be laid—and certainly motifs of the pit and the grave come into  play in Platonov’s tale—but something like “The Building Site” would  capture more of its at least provisional air of optimism. THE GENERIC CONTEXT OF PLATONOV’S  TALE: THE ‘PRODUCTION NOVEL’ The events Platonov portrays in The Foundation Pit involving  the excavation of a foundation pit as part of a plan to construct  a “proletarian home” and the formation of a collective farm in the  nearby countryside patently mimic the structure and thematic  concerns of a type of novel that had become increasingly prominent  in Soviet literature over the course of the 1920s: the “production”  novel, whose staple theme was industrialization, which it typically  represented as efforts of one kind or another to restart a factory  idled by the civil war, to increase production dramatically within  an existing factory, or heroically to create a vast new factory  complex from scratch—all always as part of an effort to meet or  105 </page> <page sequence="4"> Chapter Five still better to exceed the Party’s economic plans (after 1928, the  Five-Year Plan). The production novel was absorbed as a central  component in the “socialist realist” aesthetic that became mandatory  for all Soviet writers after the first Congress of Soviet Writers was  convened in 1934, but it had in fact existed for several years before  that event—as Platonov’s own Foundation Pit, written in the early  1930s, bears witness. The 1920s were a period of intense and often acrimonious  debate among Soviet literary factions over what Soviet or proletarian  literature should actually look like (see the chapter on Platonov’s  literary context) but one principle which increasingly came to be  accepted over the course of the decade was that it should depict  labor, especially labor understood to be a part of the larger effort to  construct socialism. It was this aim which motivated a series edited  by Maxim Gorky called A History of Factories and Plants, as well as  the White Sea Canal collection, produced by a brigade of writers  dispatched to the canal’s excavation site, and the flood of so-called  “production sketches” (proizvodstvennye ocherki), accounts by  writers of their visits to factories and construction sites, which filled  Soviet journals and newspapers during the first Five-Year Plan (the  newspaper Izvestiia, for example, published production sketches by  Maxim Gorky, Vsevolod Ivanov, and Fedor Gladkov; Literaturnaia  gazeta ran a weekly rubric called “Writers on the Front of Socialist  Competition”). Platonov made earnest efforts to contribute to this  genre. Sometime in the spring of 1929 he travelled to a paper mill  on the Kama river and wrote up his experiences in a sketch called  “In search of the future (A journey to the Kama Paper Mill),” which  he submitted to a competition for such sketches run by the journal  Smena. Unfortunately, his submission coincided with the attacks on  him in the press for his story “Usomnivshiisia Makar” and it was out  of the question for him to receive any kind of award. In a gesture  that could be taken as a perfect symbol of his relations with official  Soviet literary culture, Platonov then used the reverse side of the  sketch’s typescript to write, in pencil, part of the manuscript of The  Foundation Pit. In one of the most ironic pairings that resulted, one  106 </page> <page sequence="5"> The Foundation Pit Itself of the sheets of paper from the latter part of the typescript extols  a “lofty model of a working man” and the “fate of the whole proletarian  cause” while the pencil manuscript on the reverse narrates the scene  in The Foundation Pit in which a peasant lies down in a coffin and  tries hard to die (Vakhitova 112–16). That the real-life Kama paper  mill was rewarded for its competitiveness with radio equipment and  100,000 rubles for the construction of worker’s dormitories are also  details that seem to have made their way into the tale. Platonov also  spent January to April 1930 in Leningrad, at the Stalin Leningrad  Metallurgical Factory, and the Russian scholar Natalia Kornienko  conjectures that this visit may also have been one of the sources for  scenes in The Foundation Pit (Zapisnye knizhki 7). Both critics and ideologues of the production novel, however,  generally felt that mere factual reportage of present efforts was  insufficient; instead, in keeping with Gorky’s ideas about the  inspirational link between art and labor (on which see the chapter  on Platonov’s ideological context), the writer was urged to anticipate  the utopian future while capturing its emergence in the present  moment. The formula arrived at for doing this, which came to be  called “socialist realism,” was highly codified. As Katerina Clark  shows in her influential study of the genre, the Union of Soviet  Writers (which also ran a literary institute as a forum in which to  train young writers) maintained a list of approved exemplars which  writers were told unambiguously to emulate. The novels that were  written over several decades of socialist realism’s dominance are  consequently remarkably repetitious, adhering with relatively little  divergence in anything important to what Clark calls a “master plot”  populated with recurring character types and stereotypical episodes.  Because Soviet writers were often imitating earlier models, a novel  such as Fedor Gladkov’s Cement, the first version of which appeared  in 1925, can turn out to bear a close resemblance to a later work,  such as Platonov’s The Foundation Pit—though in Platonov’s case  this is because his tale is really a self-conscious commentary on the  genre as a whole, that is, it is a work that is well aware that it is  written in response to a cliché.  107 </page> <page sequence="6"> Chapter Five Even a cursory glance at a couple of socialist realist exemplars  reveals a similarity of plot and character type to The Foundation  Pit. In Gladkov’s Cement the hero, Gleb Chumalov, is a recently  demobilized Red Army soldier—that is, someone like Voshchev  released from his previous role in life—who returns to his native  town on the Black Sea only to find that he must adjust to the new  social conditions of the post-revolutionary era. One depressing  discovery he makes is that the local cement factory has fallen into  disuse during the Revolution and civil war and now has goats grazing  on the weeds that have grown up in its yard (Voshchev, meanwhile,  sleeps in a weedy lot that turns out to be a future construction site).  Gleb enthusiastically sets out to to organize the local workers and get  the factory up and running again (in this Gladkov follows a formula  that was to harden into dreary cliché in Soviet literature which held  that the principal natural desire of every proletarian was to labor in  a factory). The workers’ rushed, spontaneous efforts, however, bring  no results because (according to the logic of this dominant type  of Soviet literature, which as Clark notes was written to illustrate  the Bolshevik party’s view of itself) the workers need to learn to  submit to Party guidance, even when it demands what their naïve  but purist political minds regard as shameful compromises (such as  postponing the production of cement in order to repair a ropeway  so that firewood can be brought over the adjacent mountain range,  or accepting the technical advice of the bourgeois foreign engineer  who had once run the factory). When two workers are shot by  bandits while working on the ropeway their deaths are treated not  as unfortunate casualties but as necessary, almost ritual sacrifices to  the Bolshevik cause (just as a vigil is held over the murdered Kozlov  and Safronov in Platonov’s tale). Eventually the Party’s managerial  wisdom proves itself and the factory is restarted, on the fitting date  of the fourth anniversary of the Revolution—an event portrayed  by Gladkov, who came from an Old Believer family, with distinctly  eschatological overtones, as though the very mountains and air  were rejoicing in the event. Gleb has been transformed from a wily  loner into a disciplined and subordinate member of the collective.  108 </page> <page sequence="7"> The Foundation Pit Itself The novel represents the production of cement as a transcendent  fulfillment, the filling with substance of what had been a void: the  literal emptiness of the abandoned factory as well as the metap horic al  wasteland of postrevolutionary economic ruin (in Platonov’s tale no  one undergoes transformation and nothing is produced except a pit  which serves as a grave—pointed inversions of parallel moments in  a production novel like Cement). In the 1932 novel Time, Forward! by Valentin Kataev—to  take just one example written on the eve of socialist realism’s  formal declaration as the mandatory aesthetic for all Soviet artists,  i.e., precisely when Platonov was writing The Foundation Pit—the  hero, David Margulies, is an engineer like Platonov’s Prushevsky  who is caught up in a utopian construction project. In this case it is  the giant smelter at Magnitogorsk, the factory complex built by the  Soviets from scratch in the Ural mountains. As in The Foundation  Pit, the audacity of the endeavor is underscored by repeated refe- rence to the town and its smelter having been created as if out of  nothing, in the middle of a wasteland (bare steppe in the case of  Time, Forward!, the vacant, weed-covered lot in The Foundation Pit;  compare the similar motif in Gladkov’s Cement). One of the signal  achievements of the Magnitogorsk project is moreover the five- story building of brick and glass (i.e., in this steppe setting, a tower)  which has been erected to house the plant’s workers. The central  drama of the novel, however, has to do with the characters frenetic  efforts to beat a record, recently set by a rival group in Khar’kov,  for the amount of concrete poured in a single day. Margulies finds  himself torn between two conflicting views of the situation. On the  one hand are more cautious engineers and the technical manuals for  the cement mixers they have imported from Germany; on the other  are enthusiasts, both workers and journalists, who want to race  ahead at all costs. Margulies is willing to take a “dialectical” view of  science and side with the youthful enthusiasts but he keeps warning  that construction cannot be rushed beyond the technical capacity  of the machines at their disposal (the calculations Prushevsky must  run in order to ensure that the soil on the construction site can  109 </page> <page sequence="8"> Chapter Five support the increasingly monumental edifice the characters dream  of building form the parallel moment in Platonov’s tale). In the end,  though, the view that machines should serve socialism rather than  the other way around prevails (abetted by recitations of speeches  by Stalin in which he warns Russia against falling behind the  technological accomplishments of the west, the penalty for which is  to remain an “Asiatic” backwater). The triumphant breaking of the  record by the Magnitogorsk workers is presented not just as a feat  of labour but as a triumph over nature. Margulies even promises  a skeptical American visitor that the Soviet Union will bring a lost  paradise back to humanity, surrounding the continents with warm  streams to mitigate the effects of winter—precisely the ameliora- tive dreams nurtured by Platonov’s characters but disappointed at  his tale’s end. PLATONOV’S REFRACTION OF  THE PRODUCTION NOVEL IN  THE FOUNDATION PIT Platonov’s tale refracts this formulaic genre of Soviet literature in  a parody whose aims are ideological rather than artistic, which is to  say that his underlying concern is with what Gary Saul Morson calls  the “etiology of utterance” in the production novel, its motivating  assumptions about Soviet life, rather than with the production  novel’s often hackneyed artistic means (Morson 113). In essence  Platonov rereads the “Marxist” premises of works like Cement and  Time, Forward! in surpisingly literal ontological terms, as if accepting  Marxism’s claim to be a materialist philosophy as meaning that it  must be a philosophy that deals in the world of matter. That The Foundation Pit might be a “parody” in this sense  should not necessarily be taken as meaning that Platonov was in  some simple way an opponent of the Stalinist regime and its projects.  At a meeting organized in February 1932 by the All-Russian Union  110 </page> <page sequence="9"> The Foundation Pit Itself of Soviet Writers to discuss his situation, he emphatically asserted  that he had “always and consciously wanted to be a political writer,”  repeating the claim a few minutes later when one of his interviewers  asks whether he thinks of himself as a satirist (“ ‘ . . . Ia derzhalsia i  rabotal’,” 102, 104). Parts of The Foundation Pit clearly do belong to  political parody—the mindlessness of the “radio loudspeaker” at the  collective farm blaring idiotic slogans, the Party activist who wonders  if the hens on the collective farm are “pro-kulak” because they are  not laying any eggs, the sense that the construction project and  collectivization are being carried out mostly by half-wit characters  who only dimly understand the aims of the Five-Year Plan, and the  utter lack of any real accomplishments whatsoever: in the end the  grandiose construction project “produces” nothing but an enormous  pit filling up with snow, while the drive to collectivize agriculture has  resulted in the mass slaughter of livestock and the social disruption  of the kulaks’ expulsion. Moreover, the political parody undeniably  present in The Foundation Pit addresses a specific moment in the  implementation of the First Five-Year Plan: the period immediately  after the publication of Stalin’s “Dizzy With Success” article in March  1930, which briefly threw the frenetic race to industrialize into  reverse (and this topicality obtains whether the date at the end  of the text—December 1929-April 1930—indicates the time when  the events portrayed within it take place, or the time when it was  written; see also Naiman and Nesbet 624). What The Foundation  Pit suggests, however, is that Platonov continued to sympathize  with what he thought should have been the point of the Five-Year  Plan—he partly subscribed, in other words, to the aims of the  Stalinist utopia—even if he satirized and lamented the manner of  its realization. The most accurate statement to make about The  Foundation Pit might be that it is at once a parody of the genre of  the production novel that mocks its worldview—and its apotheosis,  a work aimed, in a sense, at being the last production novel that  could ever be written. In The Foundation Pit Platonov thus reproduces elements of  the plot structure and character types of the production novel while  111 </page> <page sequence="10"> Chapter Five redefining the genre’s emphases. One obvious way in which the tale  does this is through the development of its characters. The standard  production novel of the mid- to late–1920s, like its still more codified  socialist realist successors, often portrays people whose subjective  states of mind are prey to assorted doubts and petty self-concerns.  Over the course of a typical work, however, such characters, unless  they are villains, typically learn to subordinate their inner life to  the larger project of industrialization or collectivization in which they  are involved—which project also emerges as an expression of the  unerring will of the Party. Voshchev and Prushevsky, however, the  dual heroes of Platonov’s tale, are lonely individuals whose intensely  personal search for meaning does not end with the revelation of the  Party’s vision of history as higher truth (Voshchev in fact decides  that the activist must have “stolen” truth from the rest of them,  while Prushevsky contemplates suicide). Platonov’s most significant departure from the ideological  framework of the production novel, however, lies in the subtle shift  in emphasis his narrative accomplishes from the technical difficulties  which must be overcome in order to build the proletarian home  (a somewhat artificial display of which fills many a socialist realist  work) and the accompanying political work of the Party to the nature  of existence itself, in its most immediate sense as existence in the  physical world. The reasons for this shift lie in a combination of philoso- phical influences and, undoubtedly, an insistent personal vision.  One of the most interesting ways in which he accomplished the  shift is, in effect, never to take any physical action for granted but  simply by reporting them to represent even simple motions or  gestures to which we normally devote no conscious thought— and on which narrative generally remains silent (Popkin 55–6)—as  if they were full-fledged, dynamic events. For example, at the  beginning of the tale, when the weary Voshchev finds a ravine in  which to spend the night, instead of simply telling us he fell asleep  Platonov states that he “felt the cold on his eyelids and used them  to close his warm eyes” (Chandler/Meerson 3, Ginsburg 5; emphasis  112 </page> <page sequence="11"> The Foundation Pit Itself added).* When Voshchev wakes the following morning Platonov  again states the seemingly obvious by reporting, as if it were note- worthy, i.e., not to be taken for granted, that Voshchev “again faced  the task of living and nourishing himself” (Chandler/Meerson 4,  Ginsburg 5, “he had to live and eat again”). A few pages later a clock  that someone has hung on the wall in the workers’ barracks moves  “patiently on due to the momentum of its dead weights” (Chandler/ Meerson 13, Ginsburg 14; emphasis added). The information that  weights pulled by gravity operate a pendulum clock is unexceptio- nal, but Platonov’s seemingly egregious statement of the fact draws  attention to it as if it were a form of toil whose outc ome was un- certain, and his description of the weights as “dead,” which is true  of them as something inertly hanging, introduces an ontological  note reminding us that the forms of matter among which we move  are lifeless and our own “live” existence among them is vulnerable.  Not even the succession of day by night counts as self-evident in  this text. “Night continued in the garden,” Platonov reports in one  scene, as though it might have been otherwise (Chandler/Meerson  35, Ginsburg 37). Platonov finds the most telling evidence for the nature of  human existence in the gaunt and tired workers at the foundation  pit, who belong to a recurring type in his fiction which consists of  characters who live less at the margins of society than at the very  * Quotations are from the first translation indicated, followed by reference  to the page number of the parallel passage in the second. For purposes  of comparison the passage from second translation is sometimes also  provided. “Chandler/Meerson” refers to the 2009 translation by Robert  and Elizabeth Chandler and Olga Meerson; “Ginsburg,” to Mirra Ginsburg’s  1994 translation. “Kotlovan” refers to the annotated Russian edition of  The Foundation Pit published in 2000 by Nauka. Chandler’s and Meerson’s  translation usually stays closer to the syntax and word choice of Platonov’s  text. It therefore often sounds stranger than Ginsburg’s, but I place it first  in most examples because it provides a better sense of what the underlying  Russian is like. Like Chandler’s and Meerson’s, Thomas A. Whitney’s  translation of 1973 tends to preserve the oddities of Platonov’s language.  It is based, however, on the imperfect Russian version published by Ardis  in 1973 in which there are some minor omissions and transpositions. 113 </page> <page sequence="12"> Chapter Five margins of existence itself. An icon-bearing procession the narrator  encounters during a drought in “Electricity’s Native Land” (“Rodina  elektrichestva”), for example, moves over the parched, barren  earth led by a priest who is “covered with gray hair, tormented and  blackened” while even the face of the Virgin Mary on the icon is  wrinkled, “which showed Mary’s familiarity with the passions, cares,  and evil of everyday life” (Sobranie sochinenii v trekh tomakh  1:62–3). At the beginning of Chevengur an old woman in the  village gives starving infants a drink made from poisonous herbs,  to put them out of their misery. “An orphan, a prisoner, the plague,  death, the desert—would it be possible to intensify this picture of  abandonment and loneliness?” sardonically quipped one reviewer  in the 1930s (Gurvich 360). In the case of The Foundation Pit the  worker-characters’ condition can be seen as an extreme version of  the theme, well-represented in socialist and communist literature, of  the sufferings of the proletariat; but there is a decided irony in the  fact that the events Platonov portrays take place a decade after the  Revolution, when at least some amelioration of workers’ sufferings  could be expected.* When Voshchev—who among the characters  in the tale most often represents Platonov’s concern with how being  is faring in the world—enters the barn which serves as a makeshift  workers’ barracks at the excavation site he finds a group of men  sleeping on the floor. “All the sleepers were thin, as if they had  died; the cramped space between each man’s skin and his bones  * Eric Naiman and Anne Nesbet point out a series of suggestive parallels  between The Foundation Pit and a novel by Émile Zola called Travail, which  was published in France in 1901 but appeared in Russian translation in the  Soviet Union in 1923. In Zola’s novel the characters strive to turn a foundry  into a model factory called “Maison commune,” i.e., a “communal home”  not unlike the “proletarian home” of Platonov’s tale. At the beginning of  Zola’s novel the hero, like Platonov’s Voshchev, wanders aimlessly through  town until he ends up at the gates of a factory called “L’Abîme” (“The  Abyss”). Like Voshchev, he then enters a beer hall, where he finds tired  but decent workers. Much of Zola’s novel concentrates on the exploitative  nature of labor under capitalism, to be replaced by lighter and joyous  labor in the “maison commune” (“Mise en Abîme: Platonov, Zolia i poetika  truda” 620–2). 114 </page> <page sequence="13"> The Foundation Pit Itself was occupied entirely by veins, and it was clear from the thickness  of these veins how much blood they must let pass during the tension  of labour. The cotton of the shirts conveyed with precision the slow  refreshing work being carried out by the heart—there the heart was,  beating close by, in the darkness of the devastated body” (Chandler/ Meerson 11, Ginsburg 12–13). Later Voshchev watches Kozlov dig  and sees that his “trousers had gone bare from movement; his  sharp, crooked bones were like jagged knife blades tight against the  skin of his shins. The defencelessness of these bones filled Voshchev  with anxious nervousness: the bones might tear the flimsy skin and  come out through it” (Chandler/Meerson 20, Ginsburg 24). Even  a stranger who suddenly appears on the opposite side of the gully  is described as having a body which “had wasted inside his clothes  and his trousers were swaying on him as if empty” (Chandler/Meer- son 47, Ginsburg 48). If Platonov’s portrait of this kind of suffering begins with the  proletariat, however, it does not stop there. The peasants subjected  to collectivization in the latter part of the tale, too, are generally  impoverished and hungry, and even the pampered bureaucrat Pashkin  and his wife are merely lucky, and temporary, beneficiaries of their  physical circumstances: they live well only because for now they  happen to be able to eat meat, butter, and other rich food, i.e., their  existence does not escape the harsh laws of the physical world. That world in The Foundation Pit is one which subjects all  vital processes to a finite equation which yields no surplus and from  which there is no escape. When Platonov remarks that “Chiklin  possessed a small stony head, densely overgrown with hair, because  all his life he had been either digging with a spade or pounding with  a sledgehammer and there had been no time for thinking” (Chandler/ Meerson 37, Ginsburg 40) we might take it as satire or even embit- tered solidarity with a workingman’s plight, were the conceit not  repeated in still more literal terms elsewhere. As Kozlov hacks away  at the ground Platonov tells us that he works “without memory of  time or place, discharging the remnants of his own warm strength into  the stone he broke up, the stone getting warmer as Kozlov himself  115 </page> <page sequence="14"> Chapter Five grew gradually colder” (Chandler/Meerson 20, Ginsburg 24)—as  though Kozlov’s mental state were entirely determined by the laws of  thermodynamics. “Each was existing without the least surplus of life,”  Platonov remarks of the workers asleep in the barracks (Chandler/ Meerson 12, Ginsburg 13). Thus does the waiter in the beer room  Voshchev enters at the beginning of the tale avoid disagreements,  because “rather than exhaust his strength at work he preserved  it for private life” (Chandler/Meerson 2, Ginsburg 4). So too does  Voshchev hold a strangely delimiting, almost material sense of the  “meaning” he seeks in life, conjecturing that if there is no truth to be  found in life it must be because “there had been once, in some plant  or heroic creature, but then a wandering beggar had come by and  eaten the plant, or trampled this creature down there on the ground  in lowliness, and then the beggar had died in an autumn gully and the  wind had blown his body clean into nothing” (Chandler/Meerson 114,  Ginsburg 101; in a 1922 newspaper article he published in Voronezh  called “Proletarian Poetry” a momentarily ardent materialist Platonov  rejected the idea that “truth” [istina] is an abstract concept—“my  whole body wants istina,” he wrote, “and what the body wants cannot  be immaterial, spiritual, or abstract” Sochineniia I–2 164). When  the activist dies at the end of the tale, Voshchev decides that he  had “sucked” the meaning of life out of Voshchev and everyone else  (Chandler/Meerson 155, Ginsburg 135).  The three brief paragraphs describing the young Pioneer  orchestra Voshchev encounters early in the tale exemplify the  kind of constant inquiry into the state of existence which Platonov  conducts as he narrates the events of his world (the young Pioneers,  in this case all girls, are the equivalent of a Party-organized girlscout  troop). It is not that the passage denies the pioneers emotion or  thought and presents them as mere physical bodies. On the contrary,  a “happiness of childhood friendship” shows on their faces, which  moreover are lit with nothing less than “the realization of the future  world in the play of youth.” Yet Platonov tells us that they were  born under the desperate conditions of the civil war which followed  the Revolution, when “the dead horses of social warfare were lying  116 </page> <page sequence="15"> The Foundation Pit Itself in the fields” and their pregnant mothers were so starved that in  some cases the children were even born without skin (because the  “reserves” of the fetus within them were the only nourishment they  had—a particularly grim version of Platonov’s existential equation).  As a result the girls are all thin and the solemn joy on their faces  has to substitute for “beauty and homely plumpness.” As Voshchev  contemplates the spectacle they present, wondering whether these  girls passing before him somehow know the meaning of life—and  it is characteristic in Platonov for a procession encountered by the  hero to serve as this kind of existential tableau, as the icon-bearing  procession of starving peasants does in “Rodina elektrichestva”—it  is to the condition of their bodies that he pays particular attention.  They have frail but “hardening” bodies and legs “covered with the  down of youth.” Despite the traces of physical deprivation which  they still bear, they represent “time coming to maturity in a fresh  body.” There is an undeniable potential for lust, for an attraction to  phsyicality, in their “swarthy legs filled with resolute tenderness” and  in particular in the birthmark on the “swelling body” of the “small  woman” who breaks ranks to pick a plant from the side of the road.  She triggers longing in both Voshchev and the cripple Zhachev, but  Voshchev becomes concerned for the “purity and intactness” of  these representatives of the future world (in this regard the little girl  Nastya who is adopted by the diggers is their younger cousin) and  warns Zhachev off (Chandler/Meerson 8, Ginsburg 9–10). As in the  philosophy of Nikolai Fedorov, the future world would be threatened  by a seizure here and now of its physical embodiment. The mixture  of salacious and vaguely pedophilic overtones with utopian ideology  in Platonov’s passage is actually not unique in Soviet literature of  the 1920s. Yuri Olesha’s 1927 Envy features a teen-age heroine,  Valia, who emblemizes the new world. She is both the fiancée  of an ideal soccer-playing, future-building Soviet youth and the  object of resentful longing by the tale’s bohemian, alcoholic anti- hero Nikolai Kavalerov. At one point Kavalerov peers voyeuristically  through a hole in a fence as Valia performs gymnastic exercises.  She is wearing black trunks which reveal “the whole structure of her  117 </page> <page sequence="16"> Chapter Five legs,” which are suntanned and covered with nicks and scars from  vigorous outdoor sports. The “cleanliness and tenderness” of her  upper body show how “charming” she will be, “maturing and turning  into a woman” (Olesha 121). Sexuality in Platonov is always problematic, and whatever that  may or may not tell us about him as a person, in his works it al- ways serves as yet another index to the trials of physical existence.  In the early Voronezh journalism sexual desire is denounced, in  the spirit of Fedorov’s philosophy, as a primitive force opposed to  utopian consciousness. In “At the Beginnings of the Kingdom of  Consciousness” (“U nachala tsarstva soznaniia”), for example,  he declares that the kingdom of consciousness ushered in by the  Revolution succeeds one of feeling, which was “chiefly that of sex”  (Sochineniia I–2:143), while in “On the Culture of Harnessed Light  and Comprehended Electricity” (“O kul’ture zapriazhennogo sveta i  poznannogo elektrichestva”) he declares that the culture of the past,  dedicated primarily to the production of gametes, was a dead end;  only the nascent culture of thought and technology would transform  the cosmos. In Platonov’s literary works the characters often seem  to avoid sexual relations out of a lack of interest, as in “Coachman’s  Settlement” (“Iamskaia sloboda,” 1927, the name for the suburb of  Voronezh where Platonov was born), whose protagonist Filat “did  not get excited about girls” (“devitsam ne radovalsia”) and who is  handy at all sorts of tasks “except marrying” (Sobranie sochinenii  v trekh tomakh I:256). Chevengur in particular envisions utopia as  an all-male society (see the discussion in Borenstein 225–63 of this  as a general trait of Soviet culture in the 1920s; see also Bullock). When it is not banished from the world of Platonov’s texts  altogether, sexuality tends to take on troubled forms, such as  the homosexual executioner who puts Bertrand Perry to death in  “Epifanskie shliuzy” (“you won’t like it, but that’s how it has to  be,” Platonov wrote to his wife; Platonova 165), or Serbinov, the  Muscovite who visits Chevengur in the novel of that name, who  wants to make love to a girl on his mother’s grave—or Zhachev in  The Foundation Pit, who is often described as “moving his hand in his  118 </page> <page sequence="17"> The Foundation Pit Itself pocket,” or Kozlov, who “caresses himself” at night under the blanket  and therefore tires easily when he has to dig the next day.* Later in  his career Platonov seems to have reached an accommodation with  the need for sexual relations—but with evident reluctance, as in  the 1937 “The River Potudan’ ” (“Reka Potudan’ ”) whose hero at first  flees his marriage and only after his wife tries to drown herself does  he return to her, and even then dispiritedly (see Naiman “Andrei  Platonov and the Inadmissibility of Desire”). As with his theme  of existence in general, the theme of sexuality in Platonov is not  a purely idiosyncratic concern but echoes topics which exercised  Soviet culture as a whole. As Naiman points out, throughout the  1920s Soviet society as a whole wrestled with “the problem of  sex.” The apogee of the theme’s discussion in literature came in  1927 (when Platonov was writing Chevengur) and thereafter waned  (“Andrei Platonov and the Inadmissibility of Desire” 320). The existential tragedy in Platonov has to do with sentient  being finding itself imprisoned within, and threatened with being  reduced to, such states of pure physicality. Platonov speaks of the  kinds of human attributes we are used to thinking of as transcending  the flesh as if they were entirely contained within it. At the opening  of The Foundation Pit he remarks that Voshchev sits down at  a window to “listen to various sad sounds and feel the anguish of  a heart surrounded by hard and stony bones,” in effect reducing the  metaphoric site of our emotions to the corporeal organ beating in our  chest (Chandler/Meerson 2, Ginsburg 4). Similarly, the expiration of  the peasant who has lain down in a coffin and willed his own death  has more to do with a purely physical process of heat exchange  than with the departure of a metaphysical soul: “The peasant’s  heart had, of its own accord, risen up into his soul, into the cramped  space of the throat, and it had clenched tight there, releasing the  heat of dangerous life into his outer skin” (Chandler/Meerson 101,  Ginsburg 90). In the same episode Voshchev and Chiklin encounter  * Neither Kozlov nor Zhachev is a kulak, but one of Platonov’s notebooks  from 1929–1930 contains the entry, “The kulak is like an onanist, he does  everything on his own, into his fist” (Zapisnye knizhki 34). 119 </page> <page sequence="18"> Chapter Five an old peasant pleading with his wife to stuff food inside him so  that his body does not fly away, because he believes his soul has  departed from his flesh (Chandler/Meerson 99, Ginsburg 88). What makes this state of affairs tragic is that in Platonov’s  world nothing escapes the law of entropy, which subjects everything,  the mind and soul as well physical objects and the human body,  to a relentless process of decay ending in disintegration and death  (Zhachev’s teeth, “worn down to nothing on food,” are a minor  grotesque index of this process; Chandler/Meerson 7, Ginsburg 9).  One particularly stark example of this theme is the scene in which  Chiklin returns to the tile factory where the owner’s daughter once  gave him a furtive kiss. Chiklin’s memory is of a June day when  a young girl raised herself on her toes and pressed her plump lips  to his cheek, but when he returns the passage of time is evident  in the ravages that entropy has wrought. The factory itself has  sunk down into the ground and its yard is empty and deserted (in  Gladkov’s Cement similar motifs denote historical tragedy). The  staircase on which he was kissed has now become decrepit and turns  to “exhausted dust” when Chiklin touches it. In the middle of this  desolation, on the bare ground, lies a nearly naked, emaciated woman  who is dying. She turns out to be Nastya’s mother. Her lower jaw  has collapsed “from weakness” and Nastya has tied a string around  her head to prevent her “toothless mouth” from gaping open. When  Nastya asks her if she is dying because she is bourgeois, the mother  replies simply “I got bored . . . I’m worn out” (Chandler/Meerson 55,  Ginsburg 52–4). When Chiklin later returns to check on the corpse  it has become covered with “fur,” as if it had reverted to an animal  state. After the mother’s death, her mother’s disintegrated skeleton  is all Nastya has to console her. In one of his surprisingly frequent, if necessarily subtle, allusions  to a biblical texts, in a scene at the excavation site Platonov reworks  the notion of birds as symbols of untroubled existence (as found  in Luke 9:58, where Jesus tells his disciples that foxes have holes  and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to  lay his head; or the Sermon on the Mount in Luke 12:24, in which  120 </page> <page sequence="19"> The Foundation Pit Itself he states that ravens neither sow nor reap “yet God feeds them”)  into a portrait of entropy’s effects on all being. “The sun was still  high, and birds were singing plaintively in the illuminated air, not in  triumphant celebration but searching for nourishment in space. Over  bent, digging people swallows were hurtling low; tiredness stilled  their wings, and beneath their down and feathers was the sweat of  need; they had been flying since first light, ceaselessly tormenting  themselves to fill the stomachs of their chicks and mates. Once  Voshchev had picked up a bird that had died in an instant in midair  and fallen to earth; the bird was all in sweat, and when Voshchev  plucked it, so as to see its body, what remained in his hands was  a scant sad creature that had perished from the exhaustion of its  own labour” (Chandler/Meerson 19, Ginsburg 23). The several generalizing statements on the nature of existence  which Platonov offers in The Foundation Pit, often at moments when  the narrative pauses to survey the surrounding landscape, further affix  this endurance of entropy as a universal condition. “It was hot; the  daytime wind was blowing, roosters crowed somewhere in a village.  Everything surrendered itself to meek, unquestioning existence,”  Platonov tells us on the tale’s first day (Ginsburg 7–8, Chandler/ Meerson 5). The mowed grass and damp earth on the vacant lot  that is to become the excavation site bespeak “the general sorrow  of life and the vain melancholy of meaningless existence” (Chandler/ Meerson 14, Ginsburg 18). And again, later, in the countryside near  the collective farm, Platonov states that “endurance dragged on  wearily in the world, as if everything living was situated somewhere  in the middle of time and its own movement; its beginning had been  forgotten by everyone, its end was unknown, and nothing remained  but a direction to all sides” (Chandler/Meerson 73, Ginsburg 69–70,  which for the last phrase has “nothing was left except direction”). Ultimately in Platonov the question is whether anything other  than a body subject to wearying toil and disintegration can survive  in this world. This existential theme is one of the fundamental  precepts of his worldview and as such transcends any concern— which undeniably registers in the text of The Foundation Pit—with  121 </page> <page sequence="20"> Chapter Five more immediate political issues, such as the fact that the exhausting  labor workers must perform under the Soviet regime does not  appear to differ from that under capitalism (on this see Naiman and  Nesbet 631). But Platonov’s existential vision turns out to implicate  the ideology on which the Soviet regime relied, because the state  of affairs he depicts represents a kind of primitive or naïvely literal  interpretation of Marxist materialism, which holds that matter is all  that exists, and that what we might think are spiritual entitities are  really only the ephemeral results of material processes. There are  moments in The Foundation Pit that verge on parody of this kind of  philosophical naiveté, of which there are plenty of sincere examples in  the journalism Platonov wrote in his Voronezh years. Contemplating  the engineering project before him, for example, Prushevsky (who in  many respects resembles the young Platonov with his Bogdanovian- Proletkult-ish ideas) wonders, “Could a superstructure develop from  any base? Was soul within man an inevitable by-product of the  manufacture of vital material?” (Chandler/Meerson 22, Ginsburg 26).  The general inclination of The Foundation Pit, however, is to extend  at least provisional trust to the Five-Year Plan as a possible remedy  to the trials of physical existence. The response to the difficulties  portrayed in The Foundation Pit is thus not at all Leninist, as in  the standard production novel—that is, Platonov’s tale does not  work to show us, as Soviet readers in need of edification, that the  Party knows best how to guide the construction of socialism—but  a peculiar blend of Platonov’s former utopian aspirations and their  disappointments.  One clear response to the existential dilemma in The Foundation  Pit is that of Voshchev, who embodies the empathy toward suffering  being central to the philosophy of Nikolai Fedorov and expressed in  the desire to collect and preserve its remnants. Lying in the grass  beside the road at the beginning of the tale, Voshchev sees a dead leaf  which had been brought there by the wind and now “faced humility  in the earth.” He places the leaf in a special compartment of the bag  he carries, in which he gathers “all kind of objects of unhappiness  and obscurity.” “I shall store and remember you,” he tells the leaf,  122 </page> <page sequence="21"> The Foundation Pit Itself promising to find out why it lived and perished without knowing the  meaning of life (Chandler/Meerson 6, Ginsburg 8). A few pages later  Platonov refers to Voshchev’s bag as one in which he collects things  “for memory and vengeance” (Chandler/Meerson 11, Ginsburg 12).  The link between Voshchev’s habit of collecting discarded objects  and the Stalinist project for constructing socialism comes later, in  the village scenes, when Platonov remarks that Voshchev gathers  up “for socialist vengeance” things which had once belonged to  “brotherly, labouring flesh.” He delivers them to the activist, who  scrupulously draws up a list of the bag’s contents. “Now [Voshchev]  was presenting these liquidated labourers to the attention of the  authorities and the future, in order to achieve vengeance through  the organization of eternal human meaning—on behalf of those who  are now lying quietly in the earthly depth” (Chandler/Meerson 136,  Ginsburg 118). The Fedorovian theme becomes still more evident  in a conversation which takes place soon after between Prushevsky,  Zhachev, and Nastya. When Zhachev asks Prushevsky whether  “science” will be able to resurrect people “after they’ve rotted,”  Prushevsky tells him it will not; but Zhachev retorts that Lenin lies  in state in Moscow “awaiting Science,” and Nastya chimes in that he  will “arise and live and be like a dear old grandfather” (Chandler/ Meerson 138, Ginsburg 120). Essentially the same empathetic response underlies the  narrator’s comments on nature lying in a state of dull meaningless,  or “endurance” dragging on wearily in the world. Within Platonov’s  oeuvre these sentiments can be traced back to the elegiac “peasant”  poems of the early collection Golubaia glubina (themselves perhaps  partly inspired by Fedorov) in which wattle fences, ravines, and  the stars above serve as dolorous indices to melancholy. The  other closely related moment in The Foundation Pit is the hints at  the idea of a peasant utopia which appear in the collectivization  scenes and which manage to suggest—briefly, tentatively, and in  the end futilely—that redress for the dire conditions of physical  existence might somehow be organized spontaneously among the  animals themselves (in nature, in other words) and by extension  123 </page> <page sequence="22"> Chapter Five among the peasants who live among them. The sagacious horses  who collectivize themselves, each bringing a mouthful of straw  to place in a communal pile in the Organizational Yard, are partly  a satire on the “voluntary” nature of collectivization; but also partly  a utopian vision of Fedorovian collectivity extending throughout na- ture. A screenplay Platonov wrote in 1929 entitled “The Machinist”  (“Mashinist”) contains a similar scene: returning from their watering  hole, twenty horses gather grass in their mouths from the side of the  road then place it in a common pile in the collective farm’s corral and  “begin to eat collectively” (235).* An entry in Platonov’s notebook for  1929–30 reads: “Left unattended (ot bezprizornosti) the livestock in  the kolkhoz became conscious by itself: it drinks water, hauls feed,  organizes itself, etc.” (Zapisnye knizhki 33).  In these scenes Platonov may also have been responding to  the similarly animist themes informing the long narrative poem  “The Triumph of Agriculture” (“Torzhestvo zemledeliia”) by his con- temp orary Nikolai Zabolotsky (1903–1958), parts of which first  appeared in the Leningrad journal Zvezda (No 10, 1929) when Pla- tonov was writing The Foundation Pit. Although Zabolotsky’s poem  celebrates mechanized farming in the spirit of the Five-Year Plan (the  arrival of a tractor relieves both peasants and animals of physical  toil) it idiosyncratically develops its theme in the form of conversa- tions among horses, cattle, peasants, a soldier, and even a wooden  plow. Among the details in Zabolotsky’s poem which suggest that  Platonov may have had it in mind when writing The Foundation Pit  * In the screenplay this is also, however, followed by a more clearly satirical  procession of cockroaches voluntarily expelling themselves from the farm.  “The Machinist” in many ways appears to anticipate The Foundation Pit,  in particular its second half, which portrays events on a collective farm  also called “The General Line.” Many of these—self-collectivizing horses,  peasants stacking up coffins for future use, a shouting activist overseeing  the activities, the expulsion of kulak peasants on a raft—are repeated in  The Foundation Pit. The 1929 screenplay may well have served as a rough  draft for The Foundation Pit (Kornienko 140). The screenplay was never  filmed and no records of it have been found in the archives of any Soviet  film studio. The extant copy was written by Platonov in pencil, in a school  notebook. 124 </page> <page sequence="23"> The Foundation Pit Itself are a discussion among peasants as to where the soul is situated  and whether anything remains of us other than “powder” when we  die; an anthropomorphic bear who begs a night storm to relent;  a deliberative assembly (veche) of cows; a “horses’ institute” whose  representative laments the physical hardships they endure; and  a promise made to the animals by the tractor that literacy will be  brought to them along with the destruction of the old world: “We’ll  raze the old world to its ashes/And together read the letter “A”/Aloud  in a huge chorus” (275). Like Platonov’s tale, Zabolotsky’s poem  playfully (or wistfully) recombines elements of the standard Five- Year Plan narrative—without, however, veering into the grot esque,  as Platonov does. Both Zabolotsky’s poem and Platonov’s tale also  echo the Futurist poet Velemir Khlebnikov’s 1920 “Ladomir,” an long  narrative poem on the Revolution filled with apocalyptic imagery  which at one pantheistic moment declares, “I see equine freedom/ and equality before the law for cows/the years will once again merge  into an epic/the [lock] has fallen from human eyes” (“Ia vizhu konskie  svobody/I ravnopravie korov/Bylinoi snov’ sol’iutsia gody/S glaz  cheloveka spal zasov,” 15). The more aggressive and utopian mindset in The Foundation Pit,  however, is associated with the plans to build a “proletarian home”  and in particular with the figure of the engineer Prushevsky.  Prushevsky is motivated by an empathy for suffering being similar  to Voshchev’s—gazing on an empty field he feels sad that “people  should have to live and be lost on this mortal earth, where comfort  had yet to be arranged” (Chandler/Meerson 44, Ginsburg 46)—but  his response is to undertake the reconstruction of physical reality in  order to provide shelter from the destructive forces of nature. His  plan is to build a “monumental new home” into which all the workers  of the town will move, abandoning their individual residences; but  this home in turn would be merely the precursor of a much larger  edifice some other engineer is destined to build in “ten to twenty  years” in the form of a “tower in the middle of the world,” in which  all the labourers of the world would settle “for a happy eternity”  (Chandler/Meerson 21–2, Ginsburg 25). The point of this vision is  125 </page> <page sequence="24"> Chapter Five not, as it had been for many Russian radicals from the nineteenth  century onward, the communal social arrangement that would  result, but the security of the inhabitants’ physical being. Prushevsky  painstakingly calculates the soil density of the construction site and  the dimensions of the projected building in order to ensure “the  indestructibility of the future all-proletarian dwelling” whose purpose  is to “protect people who until then had lived on the outside”  (Chandler/Meerson 30, Ginsburg 33). What the workers are doing  when they exhaust themselves digging in the foundation pit, Plato- nov tells us, is thus nothing less than installing “an eternal stone root  of indestructible architecure” (Chandler/Meerson 48, Ginsburg 49).  Safronov, too, urges the workers to finish construction as soon as  possible, so that “childhood personnel may be shielded from ill wind  and ailment by a stone wall” (Chandler/Meerson 65, Ginsburg 63)  and Pashkin, who reports to the head of the local Party organization  that the building needs to be much larger than originally planned,  argues that otherwise all the children fertile socialist women will  bear in the future will “be left outside, amid unorganized nature”  (Chandler/Meerson 78, Ginsburg 72). What the characters hope their utopian structure will provide,  in other words, is an indestructible domicile for being that would  supersede the too-vulnerable one of the human body. Pashkin’s  reference to “unorganized nature,” which sounds like a satirical  barb directed at the belief that Party organization can be extended  to the natural world, in fact serves as in index to the ideological  influences on the utopian vision outlined in the tale. Some precedent  for the “proletarian home” in The Foundation Pit can be found in  Fedorov’s idea of the museum as a means for preserving elements  of the past until mankind learns how to resurrect the dead; but its  more significant source is Bogdanov’s grand notion of “tectology” as  a science of sciences uniting all existing knowledge of the physical  world and thereby making it possible to change that world’s structure.  In the article “Proletarskaia poeziia” (“Proletarian Poetry”), which  Platonov published in the journal Kuznitsa in 1922 at the height of  his own utopian-technological fervor, he defines history as “the path  126 </page> <page sequence="25"> The Foundation Pit Itself toward redemption through humanity’s victory over the universe.”  At the end of history, he states, immortality will be attained by  freeing mankind from “the prison-cell of physical laws, the elements,  disorganization, randomness, mystery, and horror.” For the present,  Platonov concedes, the proletariat will have to make do with the  “organization of the symbols of reality” in art; but this was intended  to be only the first step toward the ultimate task of “organizing and  transforming reality itself, matter itself” (Sochineniia I–2: 164–5). In The Foundation Pit Prushevsky similarly understands his  work as an engineer to involve the application of human mind to the  inert substance of the world. As he stands in the middle of the vacant  lot contemplating the project he is about to undertake, Platonov tells  us that he pictures “the whole world as a dead body, judging it by  those parts of it that he had already converted into structures; the  world had always yielded to his attentive, imagining mind that was  limited only by an awareness of the intertness of nature; if material  always gave in to precision and patience, then it must be deserted  and dead” (Chandler/Meerson 14, Ginsburg 18). As he develops his  plan for the building what Prushevsky tries to apprehend, then, is  the “precise construction of the world” which eludes the dolorous,  meaning-seeking Voshchev but on whose basis that world might be  remade (Chandler/Meerson 5, Ginsburg 7). What The Foundation Pit  represents is the meeting of this kind of utopian thinking, to which  Platonov was so attracted in his Voronezh youth, with the Stalinist  Five-Year Plan. The hope it tentatively essays is that the projects for  constructing socialism carried out under the auspices of the Plan might  somehow incorporate the aim of redeeming humanity from the world  of matter. Pashkin’s concern about nature being left “unorganized” is  therefore only partly satirical; it also reflects an earnest existential  desire. Or, another way of putting it which perhaps comes closer to  the ideological ambivalence characteristic of Platonov, it is satirical  only to the extent that the utopian hope of extending the Five-Year  Plan into nature proves false.  That hope is broadly shared by the characters in the tale. When  Voshchev tells a member of the trade-union committee that he has  127 </page> <page sequence="26"> Chapter Five been fired for thinking about “a plan of life” (Chandler/Meerson 4,  Ginsburg “the plan of life,” 5) there is no doubt what Party initiative  resonates in the word “plan.” In a moment of despair Safronov asks  Chiklin whether it is true that there is nothing but sorrow in the world  and that “only in us” does there exist the Five-Year Plan (Chandler/ Meerson 37, Ginsburg 40); and Voshchev, just after he learns that  the coffins Chiklin has brought to the village are for the murdered  Kozlov and Safronov, gazes up at the “dead, murky mass of the Milky  Way” and wonders “when a resolution would be passed [up] there  to curtail the eternity of time and redeem the wearisomeness of life”  (Chandler/Meerson 80, Ginsburg 74; emphasis added). Nor was the  projection of political designs onto the natural world (be it hopeful,  cynical, or hubristic) limited to Platonov and his esoteric philoso- phical sources. In Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s 1962 reckoning with Sta- linism, “One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,” the tale’s peasant  protagonist Shukhov—who may very well be a literary descendent  of the simple-minded Pukhov who skeptically tours the beginnings of  Stalinism in Platonov’s 1927 “Sokrovennyi chelovek”—on being told  by a more educated prison-camp inmate that by government decree  the sun now reaches its zenith at 1 pm rather than noon asks, “did  the sun come under their laws, too?” (74). The paradox that Prushevsky and the other characters in The  Foundation Pit must confront is that the existential redemption, the  rescue from bodily weakness and death, that they hope to arrange  by building their proletarian home is dependent on matter itself. The  benefit they desire is spiritual, in that what they hope to do is rescue  being from its subordination to matter; but everything in the world  around them only serves to underscore being’s tragic dependence  on matter: the doctrine of materialism may be all too correct, after  all. Prushevsky thus wants the building he designs to be filled with  people, and the people in it to be filled “with that surplus warmth of  life that had been termed the soul” (Chandler/Meerson 22, Ginsburg  25)—as though the phenomenon of “soul” would result automatically  from altering the energy equation currently prevailing in life. Again,  noticing on the excavated walls of the foundation pit how the topsoil  128 </page> <page sequence="27"> The Foundation Pit Itself rests on a distinct layer of clay beneath it, he wonders whether  a “superstructure can develop from any base” and whether “the  soul within man [is] an inevitable by-product of the manufacture  of vital material” (Chandler/Meerson 22, Ginsburg 26). There is  an obvious ideological parody in this oversimplification of Marxism’s  precept that the forms of culture are a “superstructure” which arises  out of, i.e., is caused by and therefore secondary to, a “material”  base of economic relations within society (and the parody repeats  itself in such remarks as those by a Party official to Voshchev, that  “happiness will originate from materialism, not from meaning,”  Chandler/Meerson 4, Ginsburg 5). But the parody equally indicts the  radical materialism of Platonov’s youth, when he brashly declared  in one article that “there are no values for us outside of matter”  and called “spirit” (dukh) nothing more than a “growth” on matter  (narost; “Revoliutsiia ‘dukha’,” Sochineniia I–2: 171); and together  with that youthful radicalism, perhaps, it indicts the ambivalence at  the heart of the very utopian doctrines of Fedorov, Bogdanov, and  their like in early twentieth-century Russia, all of which confusedly  propose the manipulation of matter as a means to a spiritual goal. The Stalinist Five-Year Plan, again, is involved in this to the  extent that its aggressive assault on reality and its totalitarian  schemes appear to hold out the promise of remaking physical reality.  The tale’s real tragedy involves not—or not only—the political  events of starving workers pressed to labor on a building project  whose escalating grandiosity means that only a pit will ever result, or  peasants brutally herded by Party activists into a collective farm. It is  signalled, rather, by the onset of winter, which here as in Platonov’s  earlier novel Chevengur makes clear the characters’ failure to alter  the natural order. It is signalled in particular by the death from cold  of Nastya, their little mascot of the future whom they dote on but  fail to protect from the elements. The most authentic digging any  one does in the novel, then, is when Chiklin spends fifteen hours  excavating a “sepulchral bed in eternal stone” for her—an inversion  of the utopian “proletarian home” they had hoped to build. Instead  of serving as a promise for the bright future, then, as it would have  129 </page> <page sequence="28"> Chapter Five in a standard Soviet production novel, the foundation pit becomes  a grave emblemizing the proletariat’s continued subordination to the  world of matter. That the Five-Year Plan fosters a culture of idiotic  directives and overbearing bureaucrats who force the proletariat to  toil as much as it ever did under capitalism, that it senselessly strips  the peasants of their possessions and in the name of class hatred  expels some of them downriver on a raft makes it a form of political  evil which Platonov clearly labels as such. But the real tragedy in The  Foundation Pit is that in causing such grief all around, the Five-Year  Plan also fails at what Platonov considers the one truly significant  goal it might have attained: the remaking of physical reality. All this  haste, he in effect says, all this mobilization of our lives to build  gigantic smelters and factories, all this radical re-organization of our  rural life into collective farms, and yet we still die. PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS The activist His name is capitalized as “the Activist” in the Ginsburg translation,  which captures the sense of particularity attending Platonov’s  consistent use of only a simple noun to refer to him. He is thus  the quintessential “activist,” a satirical version of an over-zealous  Party worker sent out to the village to organize a collective farm  and oversee its political activities. A character called “the activist”  also figures prominently in Platonov’s screenplay “The Machinist.”  He barks orders, forces the peasants to dance in time with music  blaring from the radio (which he pretends to direct) but in the end  is hoisted by the shovel of the excavator operated by the machinist- hero of the title—and dropped into the river. In The Foundation Pit  the activist spends his evenings obsessively studying directives sent  down from the provincial office of the Party, zealously implementing  any instructions sent his way but also worrying lest he behave  130 </page> <page sequence="29"> The Foundation Pit Itself overzealously (a reference to Stalin’s cynically moderating article  “Dizzy with Success,” which accused the very Party activists he  had only recently sent into the countryside to carry out his radical  program of collectivization of having overdone it). In Russian, as  several commentators have pointed out, aktivist closely resembles  antikhrist, “Antichrist,” though whether Platonov intentionally meant  to suggest this parallel is a matter of conjecture. The bear Bears appear often in Russian folklore, where they are typically  endowed with human traits and given the name “Misha” or “Mikhail  Medvedev” (medved’ is Russian for “bear”). The trait most often  assigned to them is industriousness. The folkloric bear is often  referred to as “trudoliubivyi medved’ ”—“industrious,” or more  literally, “labor-loving bear”—and wooden toys featuring a bear who  hammers at an anvil when a string is pulled were a typical item  of woodworking sold at Russian fairs. Platonov’s brother, Semen  Platonovich Klimentov, recalled there being a bear who “worked” as  a hammerer in a smithy in Iamskaia sloboda, where Platonov grew  up (Zapisnye knizhki 328 n. 59). Hence the bear’s tongue-in-cheek  deployment in The Foundation Pit as “the most oppressed hired  worker.” If understood, on the other hand, as a human who has been  reduced to a state of animality, Platonov’s bear becomes a symbol  of extreme enslavement (see Malygina, who further finds a parallel  with the character Sharikov, a dog who is turned into a proletarian in  Mikhail Bulgakov’s story “Heart of a Dog,” 28). Compare also Nastya’s  mother, who in her state of extreme debility grows “fur” before she  dies. In general the idea that oppressive labor reduces workers  to a bestial state is part of the ideology of labor (see Naiman and  Nesbet, who note a parallel between Platonov’s bear and the furnace  operator Morfain in Émile Zola’s Travail, 627). In The Foundation Pit  the bear becomes an avenging agent of death as he goes through  the village finding out and killing its kulak inhabitants. 131 </page> <page sequence="30"> Chapter Five Chikl in  In Platonov’s notebooks he was originally called “Klimentov,” which  was Platonov’s true surname (Zapisnye knizhki 39, 44). An entry  dated 1930 in the third of Platonov’s extant notebooks reads: “Chiklin  is a primitive, fresh person” (Zapisnye knizhki 36). Not only is he  the most prominent among the characters digging the foundation  pit, Platonov describes him as having spent his life hacking away  at something (“vsiu zhizn’ bil baldoi”). Platonov often gives his  characters semantically suggestive names. In Russian Chiklin’s  surname appropriately echoes verbs associated with striking,  beating, hammering one’s way through to something (chikat’, chkat’,  prochknut’; Kharitonov 155). The diggers Malygina notes that one can think of Platonov’s characters as  arranged on a scale of increasing “humanization,” with the lowest  position being occupied by those reduced to a near-animal exi- stence, barely subsisting on the boundary between life and death  and having no “excess of life” available to them for higher mental  functions. Thus the diggers at the foundation pit “sleep like the  dead” (26–7) and in their waking hours descend into a pit to work.  An entry in Platonov’s 1930 notebook reads, “A typical person of our  time is naked—without soul or possessions, in the bath-house  dressing room (predbannik) of history, ready for everything except  the past” (Zapisnye knizhki 42; bathhouses in Russian culture are  sometimes associated with death and the underworld—as is play- fully represented, for example, in Mikhail Zoshchenko’s 1924 story  “The Bathhouse,” whose narrator-hero is stripped to a state of  nakedn ess and robbed of his meager possessions when he visits  an average Leningrad bathhouse). A similar character appears in  the 1929 screenplay “Mashinist.” Platonov calls him simply “the  seredniak” (a peasant of middling wealth, supposedly between  132 </page> <page sequence="31"> The Foundation Pit Itself a kulak and a poor peasant or bedniak) and describes him as  “barefoot and poorly dressed. He gazes into the distance with empty  eyes drained of color, barely comprehending anything” (234). Later,  when this character is running from an approaching train but in his  confusion fails to get off the tracks, Platonov notes that “his face  does not express fright—he runs automatically and observes with  empty, clear eyes the sunlit world around him” (236). In the  screenplay it is another poor peasant named Kuz’ma, rather than  a violent Zhachev-like figure, who regularly meets out proletarian  “justice” by striking people with his fist—except that Kuz’ma is so  weak that he is the one who collapses from the blow. Kozlov  An entry in Platonov’s notebook for 1930 reads: “Kozlov is a lover of  conflict. Illness, so devoted to liberation that it’s funny” (Zapisnye  knizhki 39). The root of his surname in Russian is “kozel,” or “goat,”  which in prison slang of the time also meant “sexual pervert”  (Kharitonov 157). Kozlov indeed continues the thematic line of  troubled sexuality begun in the tale by Zhachev: he “caresses him- self at night under the blanket” and then has insufficient strength  to work during the day. Considering that it is Kozlov together with  Safronov who is murdered at the collective farm, another possible  association with the root of his surname is “kozel otpushcheniia,”  “scapegoat,” which would sardonically reverse the motif of sacrifice  ordinarily attending such deaths in Soviet novels. The commentators  to Platonov’s notebooks also point out that there was a Kozlov area  (okrug) in the Central Black-Earth Region (known by its initials as  TsChO, or Che-Che-O in the local pronunciation—this was the region  about which Platonov and Pil’niak wrote the satirical sketch that  got them into trouble with the critics of RAPP in 1929) and that it  became famous in 1930 for attaining one of the highest percentages  in the country—94%—of “total collectivization” of its agriculture  (Zapisnye knizhki 333 n. 92). 133 </page> <page sequence="32"> Chapter Five Nastya In mainstream Soviet literature children and young people are  typically represented as embodiments of the communist future (not  least in Alexander Fadeev’s wartime novel The Young Guard, about  an underground antifascist youth movement; Young Guard was also  the name of a journal for young people which began publication in  1922, and a publishing house). At times Soviet literature suggests  that children must be sacrificed, however. In Gladkov’s Cement Gleb  and Dasha’s daughter Nyurka, who bears some resemblance to  Nastya, is given up to an orphanage so that her mother can devote  herself to Party work. She dies in the orphanage’s impoverished and  unsanitary conditions (there is also an eerie scene toward the end of  the novel in which an infant corpse is found bobbing in the Black Sea  surf). Naiman and Nesbet also point out a parallel between Nastya  as an embodiment of the communist future and Zola’s Travail,  where children are destined to transcend class boundaries (625).  That Nastya so readily accepts the ideology of the Five-Year Plan,  agreeing to forget her bourgeois mother (until she falls ill and asks  for her mother’s bones), mindlessly reciting political slogans, and  goading the bear on his “dekulakizing” raids suggests that she is  in part a satire on this Soviet stereotype. That she has “come to  love the Soviet government and now collects objects for recycling,”  as Prushevsky reports in his letter, does so as well—but a drive  to collect recyclable items was a real part of the campaign to  collectivize (specifically, to help fund the purchase of tractors) and  was often carried out by bands of girl Pioneers (Zapisnye knizhki  332 n. 91). Nastya’s existential fate, however—her death at the end  of the tale from illness brought on by being left unprotected before  the elements—lends her figure another meaning and suggests  another lineage. Deaths of innocent children occur throughout the  works of Fedor Dostoevsky, where they always sentimentally signal  lost possibilities for human happiness (Nelli in The Insulted and the  Injured, who is probably one of Nastya’s prototypes, or Ilyusha in  The Brothers Karamazov) or serve as a litmus test for utopia (as,  134 </page> <page sequence="33"> The Foundation Pit Itself again, in The Brothers Karamazov, where Ivan asks his brother  Alyosha whether he would be willing to arrange eternal happiness  for all of humanity if the price to be paid for it were the death of  an innocent child). Behind Dostoevsky’s dying innocents, certainly  behind Nelli in The Insulted and the Injured, very likely stands little  Nell, whose melodramatic death is the culmination of Dickens’s The  Old Curiosity Shop. The fact that Nastya sleeps in a painted coffin  (and keeps her toys in another) already marks her as a macabre  ironization of Fedorovian hopes for redemption from physical suffering  in The Foundation Pit. Her orphanhood, a common tragic state for  characters in Platonov (e.g., Sasha Dvanov in Chevengur), is another  such marker. Platonov’s notebook for 1930 contains an entry which  would appear to refer to Nastya and which reads, “The word ‘mama’  has been repealed” (Zapisnye knizhki 43). That Nastya dies and is  buried in the pit is the pre-eminent symbol of utopia’s failure in the  tale. At the same time, the name “Nastya” comes from “Anastasiia,”  which in Greek means “resurrection” (Kharitonov 167). Platonov  appended a note to his manuscript of The Foundation Pit which  appears in Kotlovan and in the Chandler/Meerson translation, but  not in Ginsburg or some other Russian versions: “Will the USSR  [esesersha] perish like Nastya, or will it grow up to be a complete  human being, into a historically new society? This was the concern  which formed the theme of the work as the author was writing it.  The author may have erred in having portrayed in the girl’s death  the demise of the socialist generation, but this error resulted from  excessive concern for something beloved, whose loss would be  equivalent to the destruction not only of the past but of the future  as well” (Kornienko 150; Kotlovan 116). An entry in Platonov’s 1930  notebook suggests something similar: “The dead in the foundation  pit are the seed of the future in the earth’s aperture. The bath house  dressing room” (Zapisnye knizhki 43; underlining his). If Platonov  intended these notes earnestly, Nastya’s death at the end of The  Foundation Pit may be more ambivalent than somber; but if he was  simply looking for some kind of optimistic turn in the hopes that it  might make his tale publishable, the mood remains tragic. 135 </page> <page sequence="34"> Chapter Five Lev Il ’ ich Pashkin  Pashkin is a government official who enjoys excessive privileges,  a stock figure in Soviet literature of the 1920s, which from time to  time mounted campaigns against the bureaucracy. In his notebook of  1930 Platonov identifies him as “a bourgeois functionary” (Zapis nye  knizhki 39). In some mainstream Soviet works, such as Cement, the  point about such figures is to teach readers (in their ideal form,  innocent workers eager to follow Party instruction) that even when  Party officials appear to be obstructionist bureaucrats who enjoy un- fair privileges, the Party line is still correct. In others, such as  Mayakovsky’s satire “The Ones Who Held Their Meeting for Too Long”  (“Prozasedavshiesia”), recalcitrant bureaucrats are the object of ro- mantic revolutionary ire, obstacles in the path of a more immediate  realization of communist goals (not to mention Bulgakov’s Master  and Margarita, like The Foundation Pit never published in its author’s  lifetime, in which corrupt bureaucrats are punished by the devil). Sta- lin even announced a “sharpening of the battle against bureaucracy”  as one of the “slogans” of the First Five-Year Plan in his speech  delivered at the April 1929 Plenum of the Party’s Central Committee  (Works 12: 14; see also Vakhitova 115). The roots of this negative  type lie deep in Russian satirical literature of the nineteenth century  (especially the works of Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Saltykov-Shched- rin—on whose “Story of a Town” [“Istoriia odnogo goroda”] Plato- nov’s “City of Gradov” [“Gorod Gradov”] is heavily reliant) if not in- deed earlier still, e.g., the sixteenth-century “Shemiaka’s Judgment”).  Pashkin is questioned about his first name and patronymic because  they sound like a conspicuous reference to Lev (Leo) Trotsky and  Vladimir Il’ich Lenin, whose conjunction in the Stalin era would be  bizarre indeed. The surname “Pashkin” most readily suggests the verb  “pakhat’,” “to plow,” and thus peasant background; but the—in ending  is evocative of Slavonicized Jewish surnames common in the tsaris- tera “pale of settlement” (present-day western Russia and eastern  Ukraine and Belorus’): Nakhamkin, Abramkin, Raikin, Rivkin (Kharito- nov 162). “Pashkin” the well-off bureaucrat thus would seem to draw  136 </page> <page sequence="35"> The Foundation Pit Itself on the widespread conviction among native Russians in the 1920s  and 1930s that the Soviet bureaucracy was dominated by Jews. Prushevsky An engineer, and member of the pre- as well as post-revolutionary  intelligentsia (see, for example, the reference to his childhood me- mory of servants cleaning the house before holidays). Both the root  and suffix of “Prushevsky” suggest ultimate origins in the Polish  nobility and point to the inevitable failure of his plans for manipulating  matter: proszek in Polish means “(something which has been ground  to) powder” (Kharitonov 163); and in Russian the cognate prakh  means “dust,” specifically in the biblical sense of what remains of us  after we die. Prushevsky’s status explains his certain aloofness from  the other characters in the tale (Zapisnye knizhki 330 n. 73), though  the activist is glad when he arrives at the collective farm because  he believes Prushevsky will bring learning to the ignorant masses.  Prushevsky is also, subtly, Voshchev’s close parallel, even twin: in  one passage, he looks at Voshchev and wonders whether “they”  (i.e., the proletariat), too, will become the intelligentsia. Prushevsky  also represents a stock character in Soviet novels of the 1920s:  a member of the technological intelligentsia (a closely related variant  is the foreign, especially German or American, engineer) whose class  origins should mark him as an enemy but who is tolerated or even  accepted, sometimes even welcomed into the socialist family, to  the extent that he contributes his vitally needed expertise to the  construction of socialism. The doubts Prushevsky experiences also  belong to this stock type, save that in the standard Soviet novel  they are either circumscribed (the doubting, inwardly resisting  specialist is handled by Party members who see through him and  know how to deploy his skills) or transcended (by the intelligent  undergoing an inward conversion to the Party’s cause). A tension  between this kind of character’s personal life and his public role  as engineer on an important construction project was a topos of  137 </page> <page sequence="36"> Chapter Five Soviet literature, but Platonov inverts the topos by emphasizing  Prus hevsky’s unalleviated feelings of oppression and thoughts of  suicide. Within Platonov’s oeuvre Prushevsky belongs to a series  of “supermen” heroes who embody their author’s most aggressive  utopian schemes (in broader terms their origins lie in Nietzsche as  well as in such “Napoleonic” heroes of nineteenth-century Russian  literature as Raskolnikov, in Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment,  or Hermann in Pushkin’s “Queen of Spades”). These characters are  always intent on the complete transformation of the earth through  the voluntarist-rationalist imposition of a “project for saving hu- manity” (examples are Vogulov in “A Satan of Thought” [“Satana  mysli”]; Mikhail Kirpichnikov in “The Ethereal Path” [“Efirnyi trakt”];  Prokofy Dvanov in Chevengur; and Bertrand Perry in “The Locks  of Epiphany” [“Epifanskie shliuzy”]; Malygina 30–2). They are also  related to less ambitious “technological” heroes, such as the narrator  of “Electricity’s Native Land” (“Rodina elektrichestva”), whose links  with Platonov’s own career in land reclamation are still more evident  (Malygina 33). Malygina also points out the parallels between  Prushevsky, who sacrifices himself to build the proletarian home,  and a description of Lenin Platonov wrote in a 1920 article on the  occasion of Lenin’s 50th birthday: “All his soul and his uncommonly  wonderful heart burn and are consumed in the creation of a bright  and joyful temple of humanity on the site of the stinking crypt where  our primitive oppressed fathers lived—rather, not lived, but died  all  their lives, every day, rotting in deathly grief” (36; quotation  from Sobranie sochinenii I–2: 17). Unlike Prushevsky, the otherwise  closely-related machinist in Platonov’s 1929 screenplay “Mashinist”  does not specifically project any redemptive structures. Rather, in  closer conformity with the production novel as well as with Platonov’s  land reclamation stories of the 1920s, he is shown at the more  immediate tasks of toiling to keep an electrical generator running,  then working the controls of an excavator which dredges a river  for the collective farm. A notebook entry for 1930, however, reads  “Voshchev—on the excavator” (Zapisnye knizhki 40), so it is possible  that the character in “Mashinist” evolved into two closely related  138 </page> <page sequence="37"> The Foundation Pit Itself characters in The Foundation Pit. The notes of personal loneliness  are also lacking in the screenplay: the machinist eagerly gives up his  fiancée to another worker so that he can keep on dredging rivers.  Safronov  A “socialist,” an ideological conformist who is also an ideologically  alert (bditel’nyi) writer of denunciations of other people (Malygina  35). He parrots official slogans. His name alters by one letter its  evident root in the Greek name “Sophronius” (“Sofronii” in Russian),  which means “clear-thinking” (Sophronius of Jerusalem, 560–638  a.d., was a teacher of rhetoric). Kharitonov suggests that the letter  alteration, which mimics semi-literate spelling, is meant to negate  any allusion to the character’s prescience (157). Voshchev Arguably the most significant character in the tale, and the one  closest to its author’s point of view. In Russian his surname suggests  vosk, “wax,” perhaps significant as a common substance of natural  origins which sometimes also, via its association with candles placed  before icons, symbolizes gentleness or meekness (Tolstaia 259–60;  a related example in Russian literature occurs when Marmeladov  in Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment says of his kindly superior,  “He is—wax . . . wax before the face of the Lord; melting as wax!”  15). “Voshchev” also clearly echoes votshche, a biblicism (and  actually an Old Church Slavic word rather than Russian) which means  “in vain.” Another associative line is invoked through voobshche,  meaning “in general,” especially as used in the colloquial phrase  “nu, voobshche” (often shortened to “nu vashche”), which means  approximately, “that takes the cake, that does it, there’s nothing left  to be said about this” (Kharitonov 169 n. 4). Voshchev resembles the  hero of an existential novel (e.g., Sartre’s La Nausée: dispossessed,  139 </page> <page sequence="38"> Chapter Five dislodged from the safe, accepted routine of life but for that reason  awakened to the tragedy of existence). The notes in Kotlovan point  out that Voshchev’s age, 30, suggests a parallel with Christ, who  was baptized and begin his ministry then; it was also Platonov’s age  when he began working on The Foundation Pit (140). Voshchev’s  expulsion from his workplace would also seem to reflect Platonov’s  own difficulties in finding a permanent arrangement for himself and  his family in Moscow. Platonov’s notebook for 1930 has an entry  which reads: “Voshchev—a vision. Dies from [unclear]. Felt every- thing” (Zapisnye knizhki 39). Another reads “Voshchev hadn’t noticed  how he had lived without the sense of life” (Zapisnye knizhki 43).  The reverse side of the tenth page of Platonov’s manuscript of The  Foundation Pit (which was written in pencil on thin, cheap paper) has  the following note, crossed out by Platonov, for a novella to be called  “The Meaning of Life.” It was apparently to have had an epigraph which  read “The plot is not new, the suffering repeats itself. N. Voshchikov.  1867” (Vakhitova 112). In an unfinished draft for a story called  “The Young One” (“Maloletnii”) the hero Voshchev is endowed with  a family life. He leaves work (dismissed by an “automatic bell”  brought back by the factory director from a business trip to America)  but hesitates to enter his house, and once inside hesitates to let  himself be seen, because he fears his wife will stop loving him  (Zapisnye knizhki 329–30 n. 70, Kornienko 122). Within Platonov’s  oeuvre, Kornienko notes that the “doubting protagonist” who figures  in the cycle of “true tales” (byli) Platonov wrote in 1929 becomes the  “esthetic dominant” of The Foundation Pit (140). Malygina assigns  Voshchev to the type of meek wanderers, devoted to preserving  the “soul” and in search of something other than mere biological  existence, who appear in Platonov’s works of the 1920s: e.g. Foma  Pukhov in “Sokrovennyi chelovek,” Zakhar Pavlovich in Chevengur.  Often these characters in Platonov are peasants, but Voshchev is  a worker. In The Foundation Pit the “wanderer” also finally becomes  a participant in and chronicler of a socialist construction project  and the collectivization of a nearby village. Voshchev is an implicit  protest against “unconscious, mechanical existence” (the tale’s first  140 </page> <page sequence="39"> The Foundation Pit Itself sentence states that he was released from his job in a “mechanical”  factory) and suspects that “professional leaders” like the activist may  have hidden the meaning of life from him (Malygina 41–3). Passages  which were present in an earlier draft but omitted in the final version  provide more psychological motivation for Voshchev’s search for the  “meaning of life” and “truth” (istina). Voshchev speaks more volubly  in them, wondering out loud whether any one might discover the  “arrangement” (ustroistvo) of the cosmos, promising to figure out  the meaning of life in the future but lamenting that he cannot yet do  so. A labor union official welcomes his speculations as signs of the  rising cultural level of the proletariat and arranges a salary for him  of 38 roubles per month (Vakhitova and Filippova 95–7). Platonov’s  deletion of such passages in the final version renders Voshchev far  more taciturn and despondent, and the poetics of the tale more  opaque and allusive. Zhachev Primarily a caricature, a political joke in the form of a literalized  metaphor: in Russian Platonov calls him “urod imperializma,” which  Ginsburg more literally translates as “cripple of imperialism” (because  he lost his legs in World War I, the “Imperial” war) and Chandler  and Meerson translate more connotatively as “freak of imperialism.”  Zhachev is a satirical embodiment of the idea of class hatred (for  an earnest version of which one need go no further than Averbakh’s  hostile review of Platonov’s “Usomnivshiisia Makar”). He is a “cripple”  in another way, too: his injuries reduce him to a grossly physical  existence, so that his primary concerns are eating (especially food he  extorts from the well-off Pashkin) and lusting after the young Pioneer  girls (though he does become a chaste custodian of Nastya). In Russian  his name echoes two homonyms: the verb zhat’, meaning both “to  reap, to mow” and “to press, to squeeze.” It also almost certainly is  meant to suggest rvach, “a greedy/grasping person” and possibly also  a south Russian dialect verb, zhachit’, meaning “to work a great deal”  141 </page> <page sequence="40"> Chapter Five (Kharitonov 155). One of Platonov’s notebooks from 1930 contains  the entry, “The cripple ruins everything” (Zapisnye knizhki 41). IMPORTANT SYMBOLS The proletarian home/tower References to a utopian edifice—a house, home, tower, cathedral— appear in several of Platonov’s works of the 1920s, and one Russian  scholar notes that images such as “tower” and “home” (the Russian  dom can mean either “house” or “home”) should be seen as belonging  to a broader series of imagined means for saving humanity from the  physical world that appear in Platonov’s works almost from the very  beginning (for example, the idea that a motor could be devised that  would do this appears in “In the Starry Wasteland” [“V zvezdnoi  pustyne”] and “Markun”; Malygina 76). In the screenplay “Mashinist,”  which appears to have been an early version of The Foundation Pit,  the characters build only an electrical station and a locomotive. The  Foundation Pit magnifies these projects into a utopian scheme. In an article he published in the Voronezh newspaper Zheleznyi  put’ in 1919 entitled “To Beginning Proletarian Poets and Writers”  (“K nachinaiushchim proletarskim poetam i pisateliam”) Platonov  urges his “brothers and comrades” among the railway workers to or- ganize a collective creative writing studio “in order to begin building  on earth a unified cathedral of human creativity, a unified residence  for the human spirit.” “We will explode this pit (iamu) for corpses  which is the universe,” he vows in a moment of Nietzschean rage  a few paragraphs later, “with the shards of the chains we have torn  off we will kill its blind, decrepit master, God, and with the stumps  of our bloodied hands we will finish building what we have only now  begun to build” (Sochineniia I–2, 11–2). Two years later in the Voro- nezh newspaper Ogni he argues in the spirit of the left-wing avant- garde that proletarian art would appear automatically, as the result  of technological changes brought about by the Revolution. “Thrust  142 </page> <page sequence="41"> The Foundation Pit Itself structures made of rails, concrete, and glass up into the clouds, fill  them with machines more intelligent than people, let the earth  crumble under the weight of a working humanity which is happy for  the first time” (“Revoliutsiia ‘dukha’,” Sochineniia I–2, 173). Dreams of arranging utopian asylum in the form of a house  also appear in Platonov’s early fiction. In the post-apocalyptic fantasy  “Descendants of the Sun” (“Potomki solntsa,” 1922) a narrator from  the future recounts how environmental disaster nearly destroyed  the earth in 1924 (the magnetic poles shifted, the Mediterranean  froze solid) but mankind declared war on nature and managed to  win. “Machines labored and molded out of the clumsy, formless, and  cruel earth a home for humanity. And that was socialism,” he re- ports (Sochineniia I–1, 224). “A Satan of Thought” (“Satana mysli”),  written in the same year, is the tale of an engineer named Vogulov  who attempts to transform the geography of the planet to human  benefit. It was an era, the narrator informs us, when “the thunder  of labor shook the earth and it had been a long time since any one  looked at the sky—every one’s gaze was lowered toward the ground,  all hands were busy.” Under Vogulov’s command are “million-strong  armies of workers, who tore into the earth with machines and altered  its form (obraz), making of it a home for humanity” (Sochineniia  I–1 197–8). In “A Story about Many Interesting Things” (“Rasskaz o  mnogikh interesnykh veshchakh,” 1923), a meandering picaresque  tale Platonov co-wrote with his Voronezh friend Mikhail Bakhmetev,  the hero Ivan Kopchikov gathers a group of poor peasants together  to form a “bolshevik nation.” One of their first communal projects  is to build a windmill in the form of a wooden tower (“And there  rose up against the sun a wooden tower under the hot hands of  people who were alone in the hostile world, bonded together by  misfortune and the threat of the sun”). Then they construct a “big  house for every one” which Platonov describes at a level of detail  suggetive of an architectural plan. The house is built in the form of  a ring, with a garden in its middle and a garden surrounding it; each  room is equipped with a ventilator activated by body heat whenever  any one enters; the house has invisible central heating, while its  143 </page> <page sequence="42"> Chapter Five boards are all soaked in a special flame-retardant liquid Ivan has  derived from plants. Next to this “miraculous” house stands a similar  structure for livestock. The utopian theme continues later in the story  when Ivan comes upon a “workshop” devoted to achieving human  immortality (through the application of electricity) and while there  reads a pamphlet on “The Construction of the New Man” which is  a condensation of Fedorovian ideas (in particular, that chastity is the  necessary prerequisite to immortality; Sochineniia I–1, 259–65). The building theme in “Doubting Makar” (“Usomnivshiisia  Mak ar,” 1929), one of the stories which got Platonov into trouble  with the zealots of the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers  (RAPP), is particularly close to that in The Foundation Pit. Having  decided to make his way to Moscow, “to the center of the state,”  in order to see what technological accomplishments the Revolution  has brought about, the simple peasant Makar finds himself, like  Voshchev, at a construction site. When Makar asks what they are  building, a passerby tells him it will be “an eternal home made of  iron, concrete, steel, and bright glass” (like Voshchev, Makar is  hired by the construction crew but becomes disenchanted with the  bureaucrats in charge and eventually ends up in a mental asylum,  where at the story’s end he reads out words from a speech in which  Lenin complained “our institutions are crap”; Gosudarstvennyi zhitel’  98, 106). That Leopold Averbakh, the leader of RAPP, singled out the  motif of the building in one of the more heated parts of his attack  on Platonov suggests the image had currency in Soviet discourse  beyond Platonov’s story—that Platonov had struck an ideological  nerve: “And they come to us preaching human ism, as if there were  something more genuinely human in the world than the proletariat’s  class hatred, as if you really could show love for the ‘Makars’ of this  world other than by building in the ranks of the Makars those new  houses in which the heart of socialist man will beat, as if you could  really be a person other than by sensing yourself to be a mere part  of that whole which realizes our idea” (12; emphasis added). The  “surplus warmth of life that had been termed the soul” (Chandler/ Meerson 22, Ginsburg 25) which Prushevsky hopes to arrange for in  144 </page> <page sequence="43"> The Foundation Pit Itself the proletarian home of The Foundation Pit may well be Platonov’s  riposte to Averbakh’s attempt to appropriate this key image. The images of utopian buildings which recur in Platonov’s  works descend ultimately from a complex of ideas in Russian social  and political thought of the later nineteenth and early twentieth cen- turies. Perhaps the most famous example of utopian architecture in  Russian literature of the nineteenth century is the crystal palace seen  in one of the heroine’s prophetic dreams in Nikolai Chernyshevsky’s  1863 What Is To Be Done? A blend of the actual Crystal Palace  built in Hyde Park to house the Great Exhibition of British industrial  achievements in 1851 and the kind of communal living arrange- ments envisioned by the French utopian socialist Charles Fourier  (Günther 145), Chernyshevsky’s image and its attendant idea that  happiness could result from a purely physical arrangement goaded  an infuriated Fedor Dostoevsky (who had seen the real prototype  in London) to respond with his Notes from Underground (1864)  and its willfully irrational hero, who longs to stick his tongue out  at the marvelous edifice. Dostoevsky also went on to link the idea  of a false, i.e., earthly, utopia with the biblical tower of Babel—ur- source for all this imagery—in the “Legend of the Grand Inquisitor”  section of The Brothers Karamazov (Günther 149). Nikolai Fedorov,  whose Philosophy of the Common Cause was one of Platonov’s  favorite books, shared Dostoevsky’s moral urgency but reverted to  Chernyshevsky’s postivist faith in science. He considered architecture  the most “projective” form of art because of its ability to lift heavy  mass upward (Fedorov had a fear of horizontal positions) and wrote  about transforming the entire earth from “something elemental  and self-propelled into an earthmobile [zemlokhod] with the entire  human race as its helmsman” (quoted in Malygina 76). Ultimately  this terrestrial vehicle was to be superseded by a celestial “cathedral”  composed of planets and stars (Masing-Delic 101). Another, more direct influence on Platonov’s image of the  “proletarian home” is a brief allegorical sketch entitled “The Tower”  (“Bashnia”) written in 1913 and included in the widely-read 1918  collection The Poetry of the Worker’s Blow (Poeziia rabochego udara)  145 </page> <page sequence="44"> Chapter Five by the proletarian poet Alexei Gastev, whose decision to abandon  poetry in favor of real-world labor had inspired Platonov in the early  1920s. Gastev portrays the construction of an enormous structure  reminiscent of Paris’s Eiffel tower (Gastev refers to it as consisting of  “labyrinths of iron” and topped by a spire). Something of the arduous  toil Platonov’s own workers perform and their eventual burial in  the foundation pit seems anticipated in Gastev’s description of how  “hands and legs were broken in desperate sufferings, people fell into  pits, the earth mercilessly consumed them” as they constructed their  “monstrous tower” (chudovishche-bashniu). Gastev describes the  massive tower as a burden to the earth itself, whose depths contain  “boundless subterranean workers’ graves” which continually emit  “groans” (121). Incidentally, the combined motifs of workers buried  beneath the very structure they erect and the spire completing the  tower also suggest a Russian-historical subtext, that of Peter the  Great, whose magnificent capital of St. Petersburg is said to rest on  the bones of its peasant builders, and two of whose most characteristic  monuments are the Admiralty and the fortress of Saints Peter and  Paul, both of which are topped by distinctly unRussian golden spires.  Even when the tower in Gastev’s sketch has been completed and  workers climb up to its spire, they are seized with the apprehension  that “perhaps there is no tower, this is just a mirage, a fantasy of  metal, granite, concrete; this is dreams . . . beneath us lies the same  endless abyss as before, the grave” (123). Yet the sketch ends on  a note of “Prometheanism,” the belief, popular among proletarian  poets, that the working class was destined like the ancient Greek  hero Prometheus to defy the heavens and seize control of nature  itself, whatever the costs (Günther 148). “No one will shatter, de- stroy, or remove this forged tower where the workers of the world  have merged into one soul,” Gastev declaims, “where their tears and  blood have long since transformed themselves into iron!” May there  be even more catastrophes and graves, Gastev urges, then he shifts  into four lines of poetry calling on “our bold tower-world (derzostnyi  bashennyi mir)” to “pierce the heights” with its spire (123; Platonov’s  call for the proletariat to “thrust structures made of rails, concrete,  146 </page> <page sequence="45"> The Foundation Pit Itself and glass up into the clouds” in his 1921 article “Revoliutsiia ‘dukha’ ”  would seem to be a virtual quotation from this passage). Gastev’s  version of the tower-myth thus self-consciously reverses the biblical  tale of the tower of Babel (perhaps drawing on a similar embrace of  the “luciferian” rebelliousness symbolized by the tower in the 1908  Religion and Socialism by Anatoly Lunacharsky, the Soviet Union’s  first Commissar of Enlightenment; Günther 148)—and on the  Russian side of things covertly endorses Petrine projects for reshaping  physical reality, another important thematic link with Platonov. There was also, finally, a series of plans in the Soviet era to  build utopian edifices to commemorate the Revolution or, later, mo- numentalize Stalinism. Platonov’s notebooks contain no specific men- tion of these projects, but it is likely that he was aware of them. In  1919 the Constructivist artist and architect Vladimir Tatlin proposed  a metal and steel monument to the Third Communist International.  Also known as “Tatlin’s Tower,” it was composed of two airy metal spi- rals (vaguely reminiscent, in fact, of the Eiffel Tower) placed on top  of each other, each containing its own building and each rotating on  an axis. It was to have been placed in the middle of the Neva River in  Petrograd (later Leningrad) but was never built, though a model was: 147 </page> <page sequence="46"> Chapter Five Platonov may also have been aware when writing The  Foundation Pit—and if he was not explicitly aware, he was attuned  enough to the utopianism at the heart of Stalinist ideology to  intimate somet hing like them—of plans the Soviet authorities were  making for a competition, formally announced in 1931, to design  a monum ental Palace of the Soviets. The edifice was to be erected  on the former site of Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Savior,  which had been dynamited in the autumn of 1931. Unlike the airy  and dynamic structure of Tatlin’s project all of the finalists in the  competition were designs, in the spirit of the new, Stalinist era, for  gargantuanly imposing, neobabylonian structures, some of them  to be crowned by a giant rotating statue of Lenin (on the differen- ces between these two “cultures,” avant-garde and Stalinist, see  Paperny): 148 </page> <page sequence="47"> The Foundation Pit Itself Yet in one of life’s ironic imitations of art (as Vladimir Nabokov  would have put it), none of the proposed structures was ever built.  For years the site of the former cathedral remained an empty pit,  until in the 1960s it was converted into a huge open-air municipal  swimming pool. Eventually in 1994–1997 the Russian Orthodox  Church and the city of Moscow under mayor Yuri Luzhkov rebuilt the  Cathedral of Christ the Savior as an exact copy of the original. Excavation The digging in which Platonov’s characters are engaged, and which  is their only real accomplishment, is also a symbol with considerable  resonance in the Russian cultural context. In Platonov’s own life its most  obvious connection was with his work as a land reclamation engineer  in the mid–1920s, when digging wells and dredging rivers was one  of his main responsibilities. Related episodes occur in several stories  of the 1920s, where they often have sinister overtones suggestive  at once of Platonov’s growing disenchantment with the Soviet state’s  ability to transform the countryside and deeper cultural myths. In  “A Satan of Thought” (“Satana mysli,” 1921), one of Platonov’s early  science fiction tales, work on a vast project for remaking the earth  principally involves “digging into the earth with machines to change  its form,” and the “satanic” element is the scientist-hero’s invention  of an enormously powerful explosive device (Sochineniia I–1 198).  “The Sink-Hole” (“Buchilo,” 1922) is mostly a tale about an eccentric  peasant and his encounter with the Revolution, until it suddenly  deploys the physical term of its title as a metaphor for death: as the  hero dies, “the earth beneath him dropped away, like the bottom  in the sink-hole of a dried-up Tatar river” (Sochineniia I–1 25). In  “Rasskaz o mnogikh interesnykh veshchakh” the peasant hero Ivan,  lamenting that ravines deprive peasants of arable land, hypothesizes  that the Russian word for “ravine,” ovrag, comes from the expression  “O, vrag!” (“Oh, enemy!”). One Russian scholar notes that in Russian  folklore ravines are usually regarded as hiding places of the devil  149 </page> <page sequence="48"> Chapter Five (Malygina 44). In “Masters of the Meadow” (“Lugovye mastera,” 1927),  the peasants must dredge a river which routinely floods their fields  but the task is daunting because the river has a sink-hole in it which  can swallow objects as large as trees. Even in the generally upbeat  and, for all its oddities, more conformist, screenplay “Mashinist” the  digging scenes have macabre overtones. The machinist arrives in the  village with a steam excavator and begins to dredge the river; but  while he is doing this the peasants must remove silt and river weeds  by hand. Platonov emphasizes their immersion in the river’s filth: the  men shovel soil into baskets carried by the women, who then empty  the baskets on the shore. “Immobile clouds of millions of moquitoes  and flies hover over the laborers. The women carry their baskets to  the shore and return to the river. The members of the collective farm  dig. Even in the water they sweat: greasy spots of sweat glisten on  their naked bodies” (240). Such episodes in Platonov’s stories of the 1920s never just  describe his technical experiences; they also illustrate the premise  in Fedorov’s philosophy that the earth is a hostile domain in need of  transformation. But in “The Locks of Epiphany” (“Epifanskie shliuzy,”  1927), one of the most significant works published when he left  land reclamation to become a writer in Moscow, Platonov further  links a utopian-tinged episode of digging with the historical theme  of Peter the Great and the vast construction projects he undertook  in his efforts to transform Russia into a European state. Bertrand  Perry, the hero of the tale, is an English engineer who has been  invited to Russia by Peter the Great to oversee the excavation of  a canal between the Don and Oka rivers.* Like the digging in The  Foundation Pit, however, Perry’s efforts result not in the installation  of a technological marvel but an empty space. The work is arduous,  the peasants conscripted to carry it out die in droves or run away,  * Eric Naiman makes the interesting suggestion that the first name of  Platonov’s protagonist, Bertrand, is intended as a covert reference to  Bertrand Russell and the British labor movement (Perry’s middle name is  “Ramsey,” suggestive of Ramsey MacDonald, British Prime Minister and  leader of the Labour Party; “V zhopu prorubit’ okno” 68). 150 </page> <page sequence="49"> The Foundation Pit Itself local officials hinder the work, and over the whole enterprise hangs  the threat of retribution from the tsar. When, despite these obstacles,  the canal bed has finally been excavated, it turns out that the supply  of water is too meager for navigation. There was authentic historical background to Platonov’s tale  (in 1696 Peter the Great commissioned an Englishman named John  Perry to construct a similar canal, Langerak 120) as well as a broad  discussion in the Soviet press in 1926 of plans to build a Volga-Don  canal (Langerak 111). Platonov himself had published articles in  a Tambov newspaper in which he proposed installing a hydroelectic  plant in structures remaining from the Petrine epoch (Kornienko 58).  But as the critic Strel’nikova’s attack on “Epifanskie shliuzy” demon- strates, it was impossible in this era of socialist construction to write  about Peter the Great in a purely historical vein. What she takes  Platonov to task for is the implication she sees in his story that Soviet  construction projects parallel the wrecklessly overambitious ones of  the Petrine era. In fact Peter and his reign were widely discussed  throughout the 1920s, from a variety of viewpoints, as a precedent  for the dramatic changes of the Soviet era (as also, in a somewhat  different way, was the absolutist reign of Ivan the Terrible—the  best-known example of which is Sergei Eisenstein’s film Ivan the  Terrible). Boris Pil’niak, author of an important early novel about  the Revolution entitled The Naked Year (Golyi god, 1922) saw the  Petrine reforms as the imposition of a rationalist and statist model  borrowed from the west on the utterly unreceptive “eurasian” identity  of traditional Russia. The historical writer Alexei Tolstoy, who had  portrayed Peter as an uncouth tyrant in works written just after the  Revolution (such as “St. Peter’s Day” [“Den’ Petra”] and “Rearing  Up” [“Na dybe”]) went on to heroize him as a visionary leader who  created order and progress out of the Byzantine sloth of medieval  Russia in his three-volume novel Peter I, which won the Stalin  Prize for literature in 1941. The novel’s first volume was written in  1929, at the inception of the first Five-Year Plan, when the historical  parallels between Peter the Great and Stalin’s own re-engineering  of Soviet society were just coming to the fore (Kornienko 55–7).  151 </page> <page sequence="50"> Chapter Five Platonov’s “Epifanskie shliuzy” clearly belongs on the pessimistic end  of the interpretive scale, its historical allusion working to suggest  is that the Soviet—and more specifically, the Stalinist—project to  transform reality might meet the same fate as Peter the Great’s  failed scheme for a canal connecting the Don and Oka rivers. What The Foundation Pit may capture, then, as a tale of  ruinously unproductive digging, is a persistent historical anxiety  in Russia that a threatening nothingness may be the inevitable  outcome of the audacious effort by a powerful ruler to create by  command. Already in the eighteenth century official pronounce- ments represented Peter the Great as a potentate who had created  modern Russia out of nothing and established its solidity where  there had been frailty. At the eulogy delivered at Peter’s funeral,  Feofan Prokopovich, head of the Russian church, declared Peter to  be Russia’s Sampson, who found his nation weak but made it into  one of stone (“Zastal on v tebe silu slabuiu i sdelal po imeni svoemu  kamennuiu, adamantovu,” a paraphrase of the Emperor Augustus’s  claim to have found a Rome built of bricks and left one of marble)  and who transformed what had been an unstable power on land into  a powerful force on the seas (“vlast’ zhe tvoeia derzhavy, prezhde  i na zemli zybliushchuiusia, nyne i na more krepkuiu i postoiannuiu  sotvoril”).* By the early nineteenth century, however, the polarities  in this image began to fluctuate. The opening stanzas of Alexander  Pushkin’s narrative poem, “The Bronze Horseman” (1825) poise  ambivalently between horror and awe as they portray Peter standing  * These remarks draw on my “Excavating the Stone: Some Expansive Notes  on a Passage in Dostoevsky,” in Word. Music. History. A Festschrift for  Caryl Emerson, eds. Lazar Fleishman, Gabriella Safran, Michael Wachtel,  Stanford Slavic Studies, vols. 29–30 (Stanford, 2005), pp. 399–415. On  the parallel with Augustus and the idea that Peter had created Russia out  of nothing, see Ju. M. Lotman and B. A. Uspenskij, “Echoes of the Notion  ‘Moscow as the Third Rome’ in Peter the Great’s Ideology,” in their The  Semiotics of Russian Culture, Michigan Slavic Contributions, no. 11 (Ann  Arbor, MI: University of Michigan, 1984), 62–63. I quote Prokopovich from  Feofan Prokopovich, “Slovo na pogrebenie Petra Velikogo,” in V. A. Zapadov,  ed., Russkaia literatura XVIII veka, 1700–1775 (Moscow: Prosveshchenie,  1979), 53. 152 </page> <page sequence="51"> The Foundation Pit Itself godlike before the “void” of the Gulf of Finland (compare the “void”  earth over which the spirit of God hovers just prior to creation in the  Book of Genesis), commanding the city of St. Petersburg to appear  out of the surrounding bogs. But Pushkin also calls Peter an “idol”  (kumir, a word with distinctly pagan overtones), and the result of  his audacity is a devastating flood as the natural elements he sought  to subdue wreak their revenge. Similarly, the bronze horseman of  Pushkin’s title—Maurice Etienne Falconet’s equestrian monument  to Peter the Great, which in Pushkin’s poem eerily comes to life  and pursues the terrified hero, a poor clerk, through the streets of  a city—was celebrated as a feat of solidity and presence when it  was installed by Catherine the Great. Its base was fashioned from  a granite monolith weighing 1,800 metric tons whose transportation  from a Karelian forest to the center of Petersburg was an engineering  feat in itself. Yet the popular culture of the nineteenth century, and  three stories by Vladimir Dal’ (an ethnographer, writer, and author  of the most important Russian dictionary of the nineteenth century),  Fedor Dostoevsky, and Lev Tolstoy, all celebrate the cunning of  a peasant who manages to remove an enormous stone obstructing  traffic in the capital by burying it, in effect reducing its imposing  presence to nothing. In a different but related vein, in the first of  his “Philosophical Letters” the nineteenth-century westernizer Peter  Chaadayev famously castigated Russia for being an empty spot on  the cultural map that had contributed nothing to human civilization. That a similar complex of historical ambitions and anxieties  exercised minds in the Soviet era is suggested by its presence in  works by several authors besides Platonov. There is a distinct ten- sion between the idea of filling vs. emptiness in Gladkov’s Cement,  a work with which The Foundation Pit is obviously in dialog, where  a dist inct layer of religious imagery—Gladkov was from an Old- Believer family—imputes the meaning of an empty tomb to the  idle factory and correspondingly celebrates its restarting as fulfill- ment, advent, and resurrection. Even Yuri Tynianov’s “Lieutenant  Kijé” (“Podporuchik Kizhe,” 1928), a whimsical and seemingly un- related historical anecdote written just before Platonov wrote The  153 </page> <page sequence="52"> Chapter Five Foundation Pit can be read as expressing anxiety over an emptiness  which supplants presence. In Tynianov’s tale a scribal error creates  a spectral Lieutenant “Kijé” (in Russian his French-sounding name  results from the plural ending of the noun for “lieutenants,” “pod- poruchiki,” being grafted onto the emphatic particle “zhe”) while  another removes an otherwise still-living Siniukhaev from offical  existence. The eerie humor of the piece has to do with the solemnity  with which the cipher that is Lieutenant Kijé is first escorted to  Siberia (by officials who fear to tell the emperor that his scapegoat  does not exist), then pardoned by the emperor and returned to  St. Petersburg, where he marries, fathers children, rises to the rank of  general, and finally receives a state funeral. Siniukhaev, meanwhile,  wastes away. At the close of the tale Tynianov ironically eulogises,  “thus was General Kijé buried, having fulfilled all that could be in  life, and filled with all these things: youth and amorous adventures,  punishment and exile, years of service, family life, the sudden favor  of the emperor and the jealousy of his courtiers” (350). On the grander level of state-sponsored ideology the Stalin  era promoted itself as the aggressive creator of a new reality on the  ruins of the old world, a builder of factories, prodigious producer  of industrial goods, thruster of towers into the heavens, even  provider to its citizens of a “magic tablecloth” of abundant consumer  goods (Fitzpatrick 89–114). The most unsettling implication of The  Foundation Pit is not just that this image was hollow but that it might  also provoke existential tragedy, its Tower of Babel revealing itself,  as on other occasions in Russian history, to be a grave. THE LANGUAGE OF PLATONOV’S TEXT The language of the works Platonov wrote at the height of his career  in the late 1920s, especially The Foundation Pit, is decidedly strange,  in Russian as well as in translation; but in its strangeness it reflects  a very real historical phenomenon: the linguistic turmoil which  154 </page> <page sequence="53"> The Foundation Pit Itself accompanied the social, political, and economic upheavals of the  Revolution, civil war, and construction of a new, Soviet state and  society in the 1920s (on which see Gorham). Because it led to the  creation of entirely new institutions of state, the Revolution ushered  in a whole new set of terms to denote them and their functionaries  (e.g., “Party,” “soviet,” “commissar,” “militiaman,” “Red Army soldier”)  even as it rendered obsolete the corresponding terms of tsarism (not  least “tsar” itself but also “minister,” “Senate,” “Holy Synod”, etc.;  Gorham 24). To matters of social policy and everyday life the Soviet  authorities also aggressively applied a vocabulary derived from  Bolshevik political discourse which was initially alien to much of the  population. This new “Soviet speak” was disseminated through public  speeches, newspapers (witness Platonov’s own involv ement in this  process in his Voronezh years), posters (such as those placed in the  windows of ROSTA, the telegraph agency), and, eventually, cinema  and radio. It consisted mostly in terms for the entities central to  the Marxist-Leninst conception of history, such as “proletariat,”  “bourgoisie,” “strike,” “agitator,” etc., as well as a rich stock of  metaphors, constituting almost a folklore unto itself, for describing  the international situation (populated, as one contemporary obser- ver put it, by “avengers of the downtrodden, images of iron and  blood, predatory beasts, hydras, hydras with millions of tentacles,  images of the enormous flame sweeping over the world like a  whirlwind,” Selishchev 133). A significant number of the terms in this  new political discourse were foreign borrowings (demonstratsiia/de- monstration, lozung/slogan, shtreikhbrekher/strikeb reaker, boikot/ boycott). To these were added a welter of new acronyms (USSR, TsK  [for “Tsentral’nyi Komitet” or Central Committee], ChK [for “Chrez- vychainaia komissiia po bor’be s kontrrevoliutsiei, sabbotazhem i  spekuliatsiei” or the Extraordinary Committee for the Struggle  Against Counterrevolution, Sabotage, and Speculation—the initial  label for the Soviet secret police) and spliced hybrid words such  as “Komintern” (for “Kommunisticheskii internatsional,” or Commu- nist international), “Glavbum” (for “Glavnoe upravlenie bumazhnoi  promyshl ennosti,” or Main Directorate for the Paper Industry), and  155 </page> <page sequence="54"> Chapter Five “Ispolkom” (for “Ispolnitel’nyi komitet” or Executive Committee;  Gorham 24). The “OrgYard” on the collective farm in The Foundation  Pit mimics this widespread Soviet denotational habit, which litera- ture of the 1920s often portrayed ironic ally as form of disorienting  strangeness (in his novel The Naked Year, for example, Boris Pil’niak  stretches Glavbum out into a sound like the howling wind, while in  Mikhail Bulgakov’s “The Heart of a Dog” the strange first word of  the protagonist, a dog who has been transformed into a proletarian  human being, is “abyrvalg,” which turns out to be Glavryba [for  something like “Glavnoe upravlenie rybnoi promyshlennosti” or Main  Directorate for the Fish Industry] in reverse). What made the advent of this markedly new but also newly  mandatory discourse so tumultuous in Soviet Russia was the fact  that the Revolution had enfranchised, at least nominally, a vast  population of formerly oppressed citizens who were predominantly  peasant in origin, including large numbers of “proletarians” who  had only recently migrated from the village to the city to work in  factories. They were overwhelmingly illiterate, or at best semi- literate, and thus ill-prepared to comprehend the terms in which  the Soviet government spoke to them about virtually every aspect  of their lives, from the international situation to personal hygiene,  and in which it ultimately strove to legitimate its rule (Gorham 10).  As a result peasant and worker audiences often had a hard time  understanding the oratory delivered to them by Party activists and,  as they themselves perforce began to absorb the new vocabulary,  they often garbled its unfamiliar, bookish terms or reconfigured  them as something more comprehensible, however absurd (e.g.,  deistvuiushchaia armiia, “acting army,” became devstvuiushchaia  armiia or “virginal army”; militsioner, “militiaman,” became litsimer,  a folk corruption of “hypocrite”; revoliutsiia, revolution, became  levorutsiia, which through the word for “left,” levyi, suggests  something like an illicit revolution; Gorham 26). At the same time the  large-scale literacy campaign mounted by the Soviet government,  whose success was one of its indisputable achievements, both filled  an urgent social need and provided an unprecedented opportunity  156 </page> <page sequence="55"> The Foundation Pit Itself for the Soviet government to shape the worldview of its citizens (as  in the only slightly exaggerated instance of Platonov’s activist, who  teaches the women on the collective farm how to read by having  them rehearse a political lexicon for each letter of the alphabet: “A”  is for “avant-garde, activist committee, alleluia-monger, advance,  arch-lefist, anti-Fascist”, etc.; Chandler/Meerson 102, Ginsburg 91). The language of The Foundation Pit also developed out of one  of the principal responses to this linguistic change which registered  itself in the literature of post-revolutionary Russia, a manner of writing  called skaz which consisted in the imitation of markedly non-standard  oral speech (an equivalent in American letters would be the southern  black dialect imitated in the Uncle Remus stories of Joel Chandler  Harris). The vogue for skaz in the 1920s had much to do with the  political motivation of ceding the narrative tribunal, as it were, to the  newly enfranchised peasant and worker classes (though the works  in question were far more often written by educated urban writers  who were approximating or inventing an “authentic” folk voice).  Unlike the nineteenth-century precedents (in works by writers like  Gogol, Leskov, and Dal’) on which it drew, however, whose leanings  were Romantic and nationalist, the 1920s vogue followed a decade  of aesthetic experimentation by the literary avant-garde and often  sought to use unusual, semi-literate speech as a means to formal  innovation. It was this experimentalist aspect of skaz which also  attracted the attention of Formalist theoreticians of literature, such  as Boris Eikhenbaum, who defined it as the displacement of mere  description by the implicitly oral mimcry of narrative performance  (especially in the works of Gogol; see his 1924 “How Gogol’s  ‘Overcoat’ Was Made”) and the philosopher-philologist Mikhail  Bakhtin, who in his Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics redefined skaz  as an emphasis on the speech or voice of an Other (“chuzhaia rech’,”  “chuzhoi golos,” Problemy poetiki Dostoevskogo 222; Problems of  Dostoevsky’s Poetics 192). In practice skaz narrative ranged from  the episodic use of “folk” dialog to entire narratives given over  to an “authentic” worker’s or peasant’s voice (such as Alexander  Serafimovich’s The Iron Flood, a novel recounting the long march of  157 </page> <page sequence="56"> Chapter Five a Red Army detachment, the whole of which is related in a mixture of  Russian and Ukrainian). At times the effect was pointedly ironic rather  than laudatory, as in Pil’niak’s The Naked Year, where unlettered  garblings are treated as avant-garde neologisms; or in Isaac Babel’s  story “Salt,” a part of his civil-war cycle Red Cavalry, where the  linguistically crude authenticity of a Red Army soldier’s account of  how he shot a woman who smuggled salt aboard a military train  by pretending it was an infant only seems to mask the horror of  what he relates. At its complex and sophisticated end the ceding of  narrative prerogative to a semi-literate voice could also yield subtly  unsettling shifts in the perception of reality. Mikhail Zoshchenko,  who wrote comic stories with hidden depths in the narrative voice of  an uncultured proletarian, claimed that he was merely the temporary  replacement for an “imaginary but genuine proletarian writer” who  would someday appear (10; and one scholar has suggested that  Platonov was that very writer, Chudakova 117). Some of Platonov’s early stories are clearly meant to be  exercises in skaz in which a “folk” voice is used to relate the tale  of how a simple peasant encounters the Revolution (e.g., the 1920  “Chul’dik and Epishka” or the 1922 “Buchilo”). In a somewhat  different vein, the influence of Pil’niak’s more modernist-oriented  verbal experimentation can be detected in the protracted imitation of  the language of an advertising brochure in the 1925–6 “Antiseksus”  and in the incorporation in the text of graphic realia such as signs,  labels, and letters in some of the stories in the Locks of Epiphany  collection (1927) as well as in the protracted imitation of Petrine-era  speech in the story “The Locks of Epiphany” itself (Langerak 143–4).  Platonov also appears actively to have collected examples of the  everyday Soviet speech around him. At the February 1932 meeting  organized by the All-Russian Union of Soviet Writers to discuss  his situation, he comments that, “in our everyday life there exists  extremely rewarding material which simplifies the writer’s work. In  our society the separation between art and reality has decreased.  Art lies on the surface of reality in an already half-prepared form,  because our reality is so unusual that the distance between art and  158 </page> <page sequence="57"> The Foundation Pit Itself reality is already close” (“ ‘ . . . Ia derzhalsia i rabotal’ ” 102). A sketch  called “The Factory of Literature” (“Fabrika literatury”) which Pla- tonov wrote in 1926 but never published in his lifetime provides  some insight into what this “half-prepared” material may have been.  In it he comments that he buys leatherbound notebooks in which  to collect “half-finished products” for his literary works (in Russian,  polufabrikat, which denotes any partly-processed good requiring  some additional preparation by the purchaser but especially food  items requiring only cooking). He then explains that these verbal  polufabrikaty consist in “myths, historical and contemporary facts  and events, everyday doings, the affixation of a will toward a better  fate—all this set down by thousands of nameless but living and  eloquent mouths, by hundreds of ‘dry’ official documents which are  incomparable in their density and style” (“Fabrika literatury” 197–9).  It is likely that this passage and the entire sketch containing it were  meant ironically (not least the leatherbound notebooks, since Pla- ton ov is known to have used cheap notebooks meant for school- children) but it nonetheless reveals a writer alert to the unusual  forms of speech surrounding him. The Foundation Pit itself is not only written in a style which  grew out of the linguistic turmoil and literary experimentation of  the 1920s, it makes the collision of semi-literate consciousness with  the bookish discourse of Soviet ideology one of its primary themes.  Like so many other areas of life in Soviet Russia, however, the  linguistic culture had changed with the advent of Stalinism in the  late 1920s. The cultivation of folk and dialect forms of Russian, or  at the very least the welcoming tolerance of them, that had been  typical in the years immediately following the Revolution had given  way to impatience and even dismissiveness. By the beginning of the  1930s the untutored voice of the peasant and working classes was  no longer in vogue. Instead, it was being vigorously repressed in  favor of the “correct,” literate language of the Party-state (Gorham  132). What The Foundation Pit in effect shows is the imposition of  this language of the Party-state as a mandatory form of speech on  the half-comprehending diggers at the excavation site and peasants  159 </page> <page sequence="58"> Chapter Five on the collective farm. The language of the Party-state invades  their world from all sides. The activist teaches peasant women how  to read by using a politicized alphabet. Safronov wants to install  a radio at the excavation site so that the workers, whom he calls the  “backward masses” can experience a cultural revolution by listening  to “achievements and directives” (Chandler/Meerson 49, Ginsburg  50)—and once the “radio loudspeaker” is installed it pours forth  an incessant stream of words “like a blizzard,” urging absurd campaigns  such as the clipping of horses manes and tails and the “mobilization”  of stinging nettles “on the Front of Socialist Construction” (Chandler/ Meerson 57, Ginsburg 55–6). Later the activist sets up another radio  on the collective farm, where it blares a “campaign march” to which  the peasants all “[stamp] joyfully on the spot” (Chandler/Meerson  129, Ginsburg 113). Party directives, which are regarded as a kind  of holy writ, are another important vessel for the language of the  state. The activist sits up all night at the collective farm, poring over  the latest dispatches from the regional Party headquarters and even  tearing up at the sight of the official stamp. The irony with which Platonov relates such behavior is evident,  but in the world of The Foundation Pit no one really resists the Party’s  way of speaking. If anything, they eagerly absorb it. “Let me organize  myself close to you,” Pashkin tells his overfed wife (Chandler/Meerson  35, Ginsburg 37). If at times this absorption of Party-speak seems  ironic, the irony nonetheless reveals an underlying logic according  to which political rhetoric can be applied directly to life. Safronov,  who is an ideological zealot, tries to use “logical and scientific  words” because he knows that socialism is supposed to be scientific  (though the fact that he “equips” his words with two meanings, “one  fundamental and one reserve” suggests that this discourse is far  from straightforward; Chandler/Meerson 36, Ginsburg 38). Kozlov,  who develops “an intense love for the proletarian masses,” also  on waking every morning reads in bed, memorizing “formulations,  slogans, lines of poetry, precepts, all kinds of words of wisdom,  the theses of various reports, resolutions, verses from songs, and  so on” (Chandler/Meerson 75, Ginsburg 70)—an omnivorousness  160 </page> <page sequence="59"> The Foundation Pit Itself reminiscent of the feckless valet Petrushka in Nikolai Gogol’s 1842  Dead Souls, who reads any book which comes his way, amazed at  how in them words keep forming themselves out of letters. Even  little Nastya spout slogans left and right (“Liquidate the kulaks as  a class! Long live Lenin, Kozlov, and Safronov!” Chandler/Meerson 94,  Ginsburg 84), essentially cancelling the innocence her figure im- ports from its antecedents in Dostoevsky. Less thematically evident,  but still more potent for any contemporary who would have read  Platonov’s text, are the several passages which paraphrase well- known phrases from speeches by Stalin (on the “dialog” which The  Foundation Pit conducts with Stalin’s speeches of 1929–1930, see  Zolotonosov 270–5). The directive the activist receives toward the end of the tale  accus ing him and the General Line collective farm of “overzealous- ness, reckless opportunism and all kinds of sliding away, down left  and right slopes” and of “rushing forward into the leftist quagmire  of rightist opportunism” (Chandler/Meerson 149, Ginsburg 128–9)  mimics key phrases in speeches Stalin made in the context of collec- tivization, in one of which (“An Answer to Comrades on the Collective  Farm,” given on 3 April 1930) he explains that “The chief danger now  for us is the right-wing one. The right-wing danger has been and re- mains the chief one for us . . . Therefore, in order to battle successfully  with right-wing opportunism we must overcome ‘left-wing’ opportu- nists. ‘Left-wing’ overzealots are now the objective allies of the right- wing deviationists” (quoted in Zapisnye knizhki 324 n. 29). Platonov’s  notebook for 1929–1930 contains the entry, “A Sketch. The Battle  with the Non-chief Danger (the Left one)” and in the sketch “For  Future Use” (“Vprok”) which so angered Stalin the narrator asks  a companion which danger is the chief one and is told that the  nonchief danger fuels the chief one (Zapisnye knizhki 3, 324 n. 29). What makes The Foundation Pit so unusual is that the narrator  as well as the characters—in other words, the text itself—appears  to have absorbed the language of the Stalinist Five-Year Plan as  though it were the inevitable way to speak about the world. One  minor but telling index of this is the way the narrative begins in the  161 </page> <page sequence="60"> Chapter Five second half of the tale to speak of the members of the collective farm  using, in Russian, only the single noun “kolkhoz” (collective farm):  e.g., “the kolkhoz, carried away by the dance, paid no mind to his  word” (Ginsburg 116; Chandler/Meerson 133, though Chandler and  Meerson opt for the fuller “collective farm”); “outside the kolkhoz sat  down by the fence” (Ginsburg 127, Chandler/Meerson 147). Properly  speaking, a kolkhoz is an institution; but by speaking of it as if it were  a singular person, Platonov treats the ideology of collectivization as  if it were reified truth. This suspension of corrective irony (that is,  of a narrative consciousness whose presence implicitly reassures us  that the characters’ manner of speech is indeed peculiar) resembles  some of the stories by Platonov’s contemporary Zoshchenko—save  that in Zoshchenko the narrative is always a socially-marked oral  performance, a tale by a racounteur. In Platonov, at least in the  works he wrote from the mid–1920s to the early 1930s, no such  persona comes to the fore. Instead, the linguistic impulse of Party  ideology is allowed to penetrate to the level of grammar itself,  triggering unexpected combinations of words that initially appear  erroneous but an instant later, on another semantic plane, suddenly  resonate as though they were strangely apt. As one Russian scho- lar describes it, Platonov “thinks within grammar, transmitting  a multidimensional view, a paradoxical and antinomial logic; with  his unexpected selection and combination of words, of lexical and  syntactic constructions which explode the norm but then strike one  with their sense, he conveys a vision which transcends thought”  (Semenova 365). Or as the poet Joseph Brodsky puts it in an oft- quoted passage, “[Platonov] is a millenarian writer if only because he  attacks the very carrier of millenarian sensibility in Russian society:  the language itself—or, to put it in a more graspable fashion, the  revolutionary eschatology embedded in the language . . . [Platonov’s]  every sentence drives the Russian language into a semantic dead  end or, more precisely, reveals a proclivity for dead ends, a blind- alley mentality in the language itself” (283, 286). Ultimately, the verbal events which take place in The Foundation  Pit are constituted by, and therefore inseparable from, properties  162 </page> <page sequence="61"> The Foundation Pit Itself of the Russian language (not just its grammar but its network of  connotative meanings as well)—and even more specifically, by the  peculiar form of that language that began to be deployed in support  of state ideo logy in the Stalin era. It is therefore very difficult to  conv ey a full sense of how his style works when discussing Platonov  in translation. But it is not impossible to approximate that sense by  describing some of what takes place within the language of his text.* One way in which Platonov refracts the language of Stalinism in  the text of The Foundation Pit is simply through the ironic recitation  of some of its characteristic phrases (significantly, in the speech  of the narrator as much as in that of the characters). In one of  the scenes at the collective farm Chiklin lies down to sleep next  to Voshchev and the narrator tells us that he then “calmed down  until a brighter morning” (Chandler/Meerson 95; “and rested till the  brighter morning,” Ginsburg 85; “i uspokoilsia do bolee svetlogo  utra,” Kotlovan 75). The morning will obviously be “brighter” than  the night, but the “bright morning” (svetloe utro) that was to dawn  with the advent of communism also ironically invokes one of the  regime’s utopian clichés. A similar irony resonates when the narrator  reports that “that morning Kozlov had liquidated as a feeling his love  for a certain middling lady” (Chandler/Meerson 74; “for a certain  middle-class lady,” Ginsburg 70; “Segodnia utrom Kozlov likvidiroval  kak chuvstvo svoiu liubov’ k odnoi srednei dame,” Kotlovan 63).  Likvidirovat’, “to liquidate” is a conspicuously foreign term whose  only association is with the language of political retribution (as in  the slogan that the kulaks needed to be liquidated as a class). The  irony of (mis)using it as a synomym for “terminate” lies in suggesting  that political liquidation extends to all of life’s events. A related instance involving the seemingly inadvertent citation  of a phrase from another context has to do not with Stalinism but  with the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Of some young girls and  adolescents on the collective farm, Platonov’s narrator remarks that  * On language in Platonov see also, inter alia, my Andrei Platonov 160–75;  Tolstaia; Tsvetkov; Dhooge. 163 </page> <page sequence="62"> Chapter Five “For the main part they were indifferent to the alarm of their  fathers . . . they lived in the village like strangers, as if pining with  love towards something far distant” (Chandler/Meerson 144; Ginsburg  curiously omits this phrase, leaping directly from “In general they  were indifferent to the anxiety of their fathers” to the following sen- tence, “and they endured the poverty at home . . . ,” 125; devushki i  podrostki “v obshchem ravnodushno otnosilis’ k trevoge ottsov . . . oni  zhili, kak chuzhie v derevne, slovno tomilis’ liubov’iu k chemu-to  dal’nemu,” Kotlovan 104). In Russian the phrase “liubov’ k dal’nemu”  (love for something—or more likely someone, since its opposite,  “liubov’ k blizhnemu” is the biblical “love for one’s neighbor”— distant) has distinct Nietzschean connotations. In Thus Spake Zara- thustra, in the section entitled “Neighbor Love,” Nietzsche promotes  “love for the furthest and future ones . . . and phantoms” over effe- minizing love for one’s neighbor (see Zholkovsky 289). One of the  stories marking Platonov’s re-entry into Soviet letters after the  critical attacks on him in the late 1920s was the 1934 “The Love of  the Distant” (“Liubov’ k dal’nemu”). The deployment of the phraseo- logism in this passage, which initially appears to be just a geogra- phical reference, raises it to the plane of utopian thought on which  Platonov’s characters seem instinctively to exist. The more significant of Platonov’s verbal effects in The  Foundation Pit, however, tend to involve grammatically or lexically  incorrect usage which turns out to sound apt because it introduces  or reinforces an existential theme. One way in which this happens  is through the narrative’s habit of explicitly recounting events or  processes that are normally taken for granted and therefore not  remarked—the refusal to take existence for granted discussed  earlier. “His heart was beating as usual,” Platonov reports as Chiklin  begins to dig in the foundation pit (Chandler/Meerson 16). Ginsburg  has “his heart beat at its customary pace” (19), in keeping with  the general tendency of her translation to smooth over some of  Platonov’s oddities; but Platonov’s “Serdtse ego privychno bilos’ ”  (Kotlovan 29) in fact poises ambivalently between these two inter- pretations of the adverb privychno (which could mean either “in its  164 </page> <page sequence="63"> The Foundation Pit Itself usual manner” or “as it was wont to do”). In fact what Platonov  does is to use an apparent statement that Chiklin’s heartbeat does  not increase to make the egregiously obvious, but here highly  significant, comment that existence is a task which can never be  taken for granted (hence if Chiklin’s heart is still beating, that is  a noteworthy event). An odder effect occurs when Voshchev leaves  the Trade Union committee at the beginning of the tale. Platonov  remarks that he walks past the beer room on the outskirts of town  and “then Voshchev found himself in space” (Chandler/Meerson 5,  Ginsburg 6, “i Voshchev ochutilsia v prostranstve,” Kotlovan 23).  This is a truism, since everywhere Voshchev moves within his world  is within “space”; but Platonov’s unexpected conjunction of the con- crete verb “found himself” (ochutilsia) with the abstract noun “space”  makes Voshchev the immediate experiencer of a philosophical cate- gory. Something similar takes place later in the tale when a group  of poor and middling peasants wanders off “and disappeared far  off, in outside space” (Ginsburg 85; “and disappeared far away, in  space that was strange,” Chandler/Meerson 96; “i skrylis’ vdaleke,  v postoronnem prostranstve,” Kotlovan 76). The relevant adjective  here, postoronnyi, means “outside” in the sense of “extraneous” (as  in the phrase, “postoronnym vkhod vospreshchen,” which prohibits  entry to “extraneous,” i.e., unauthorized persons). To translate Pla- tonov’s phrase as “and they disappeared into unauthorized space”  would capture some of the odd literalness with which they appear  to depart the ideologically privileged area of the collective farm for  the alien terrain surrounding it. A couple of sentences later, “from  a large cloud that stopped over some far and remote fields, rain came  down like a wall and wrapped the walkers in the midst of moisture”  (Chandler/Meerson 96–7; “A wall of rain came down from the huge  cloud which stopped over deserted distant fields and covered the  vanished marchers with moisture,” Ginsburg 86; “Iz bol’shogo oblaka,  ostanovivshegosia nad glukhimi dal’nimi pashniami, stenoi poshel  dozhd’ i ukryl ushedshykh v srede vlagi,” Kotlovan 76). The noun  sreda, translated by Chandler and Meerson as “midst” and indirectly  absorbed within Ginsburg’s “covered” means “element,” in the sense  165 </page> <page sequence="64"> Chapter Five of the domain or substance within which something takes place  (as in “prirodnaia sreda,” literally “natural medium/element,” which  idiomatically means “environment”). What the rain cloud does, then,  is literally to hide the departed peasants behind the very element of  water (or moisture, vlaga). A more frequent, and ultimately more striking, way in which  Platonov’s text unexpectedly foregrounds existential themes is  through sentences in which incompatible grammatical or lexical  elements collide—as though the speaker did not understand they  came from different registers of speech. In the scene in which  the Chiklin and others stand guard at the collective farm over the  murdered Kozlov and Safronov, Platonov states that “current time  went on quietly passing in the midnight gloom of the collective  farm” (Chandler/Meerson 83; “the flowing time moved slowly in the  midnight darkness of the kolkhoz,” Ginsburg 76; “tekushchee vremia  tikho shlo v polnochnom mrake kolkhoza,” Kotlovan 68). The Russian  phrase “tekushchee vremia” means “current time” as Chandler and  Meerson have it, but in the bureaucratic sense of “the present time”  (appropriate to economic plans, for instance); its literal meaning is  “flowing time,” which is what the latinate “current” also means. But  it is an abstract flowing. To say—in the kind of semi-literate error  that any schoolteacher would have corrected—that such time was  going in the gloom of the collective farm is to reify it as a physical  process and remind us of the frictive way the self experiences the  world in Platonov. When Prushevsky, who views engineering as  a struggle between sentient being and dead matter, stands looking  across the foundation pit toward a distant industrial complex and  Platonov remarks that the engineer knew that “there was nothing  there except dead building material and tired unthinking people”  (Chandler/Meerson 21; “there was nothing there but inanimate  building materials and tired, unthinking men,” Ginsburg 25; “tam  net nichego, krome mertvogo stroitel’nogo materiala i ustalykh, ne- dumaiushchikh liudei,” Kotlovan 32). The phrase “mertyi material”  is literally “dead material,” but it means simply “objects and tools  used in production.” Platonov’s use of the phrase in the context  166 </page> <page sequence="65"> The Foundation Pit Itself of Prushevsky’s thoughts about his profession, however, awakens  the adjective’s existential meaning and underscores the theme  of being’s struggle against matter and death. This is, in fact, one  of Platonov’s favorite puns and its repetition in the text sustains  a discourse about ontological death. In one of the scenes at the  collective farm Platonov tells us that “Chiklin and Voshchev left the  OrgYard and went to look for dead inventory, in order to judge its  fitness” (Ginsburg 87; “Chiklin and Voshchev left the Yard to go and  look for the dead stock, in order to glimpse its fitness,” Chandler/ Meerson 98; “Chiklin i Voshchev vyshli s Orgdvora i otpravilis’ iskat’  mertyvi inventar’, chtoby uvidet’ ego godnost’,” Kotlovan 77). The  phrase’s antonym appears with macabre irony as snow begins to fall  on the collective farm and the peasants, “having liquidated the last  of their steaming live inventory [ . . . ] began to eat meat: (Ginsburg  100; “after liquidating all their last breathing livestock, the peasants  had begun to eat beef,” Chandler/Meerson 113; “lividirovav ves’  poslednii dyshashchii zhivoi inventar’, muzhiki stali est’ goviadinu,”  Kotlovan 86). “Zhivoi inventar’,” which is literally, “living inventory”  but idiomatically means “cattle,” is, in fact, the dominant phrase  in Russia’s traditionally agrarian economy, and assigns “mertvyi  inventar’ ” its contrasting meaning as equipment and tools. In  Platonov’s use of it, however, the unexpected conjunction of it with  the adjective dyshashchii (“breathing”) once again highlights the  literal meaning of living and intensifies the tragic sense of what has  taken place. Most characteristic of Platonov’s play on the language of Stalin’s  would-be utopia, however, are the instances in which he uncovers  existential meanings in the phraseology of the Soviet government  and its Five-Year Plan, or political meanings characteristic of Stalinism  within the lexicon of everyday events. When Voshchev delivers the sack of discarded objects he has  been gathering to the activist, the latter makes a list of its contents.  “Instead of people, the activist listed tokens of existence: a bast sandal  of a bygone century, a tin ring from the ear of a shepherd, a homespun  trouser-leg, and sundry other accoutrements of a labouring but  167 </page> <page sequence="66"> Chapter Five dispossessed body” (Chandler/Meerson 136; “Instead of people,  the activist entered evidences of existence: a bast shoe from the  last century, a leaden earring from a shepherd’s ear, a trouserleg of  homespun cloth, and a variety of other equipment of a laboring but  propertyless body,” Ginsburg 118; “Vmesto liudei aktivist zapisyval  priznaki sushchestvovan’ia: lapot’ proshedshego veka, oloviannuiu  ser’gu ot pastush’ego ukha, shtaninu iz riadna i raznoe drugoe  snariazhenie trudiashchegosia, no neimushchego tela,” Kotlovan 99).  The word trudiashchiisia, used to modify “body” at the end of  Platonov’s phrase normally functions as a noun meaning “laborer”  or “worker” (as in, “po pros’be trudiashchikhsia,” “at the workers’  request,” the usual rationalization given by Soviet author ities for  price hikes). By coupling it with the noun telo, “body,” however,  Platonov awakens its literal meaning: together with the ideological  concept of the workers to whom the objects belonged there appears  the image of a body which labors but has nothing—an existential  rereading of Marxist terminology which is entirely in keeping with  Platonov’s philosophical response to the Soviet regime. When Chiklin strikes a peasant at the collective farm who says  he continues living “without meaning to” while Kozlov and Safronov  have been murdered, “the peasant staggered but was careful not to  lean over too far in case Chiklin thought he had kulak inclinations  himself, and so he stood even closer before him, wishing to get him- self maimed more powerfully and then petition for himself, by means  of suffering, the right to life of a poor peasant” (Chandler/Meerson  86; “The peasant fell, but he was afraid to move back too far, or  Chiklin might think something prosperous about him, and he stood  up even closer to him, hoping to get maimed still worse, and earn by  his suffering the right to life as a poor man,” Ginsburg 79–80; “Muzhik  bylo upal, no poboialsia daleko uklonit’sia, daby Chiklin ne podumal  pro nego chego-nibud’ zazhitochnogo, i eshche blizhe predstal pered  nim, zhelaia posil’nee izuvechit’sia, a zatem iskhodataistvovat’ sebe,  posredstvom muchen’ia, pravo zhizni bedniaka,” Kotlovan 70). The  scene most immediately suggests the literal meaning of the action  the peasant tries to avoid, uklonit’sia, “to lean over”; but in the  168 </page> <page sequence="67"> The Foundation Pit Itself language of Stalinism and its metaphors of journey on the road to  utopia this same verb means “to deviate (politically).” The act of  falling when Chiklin hits him (Chandler and Meerson accurately have  him stagger, not fall) would thus be a politically deviant admission  of guilt as a prosperous peasant—and the world in which Platonov’s  characters move thus ironically becomes one in which every physical  action is directly linked with a political meaning. A related, sinister  example occurs early in the tale when the workers in the barracks tell  Voshchev that he can stay there for the night, “Go and sleep there till  morning—then they’ll sort out who you are” (Chandler/Meerson 11;  “Go there and sleep till morning, then we’ll see about you,” Ginsburg  12; “Stupai tuda i spi do utra, a utrom ty vyiasnish’sia,” Kotlovan 27).  Both Chandler/Meerson and Ginsburg in this instance go directly to  the implied meaning of the phrase but omit the seemingly innocent  remark beneath which it is buried: the verb vyiasnit’sia, especially  in the reflexive form used here, more generally means something  like “to clear up” (like a sky after rain). The political meaning (which  in Russian would more correctly be conveyed by the transitive form  of the verb: “utrom tebia vyiasniat,” “in the morning they will sort  you out”) that the authorities are going to clear up the question of  Voshchev’s class identity, and with that his social standing, is thus  overlaid ominously on what first appears to be a simple statement  that in the morning things will be brighter or clearer for him. The Russian-American scholar Olga Meerson has identified a  char acteristic narrative strategy in Platonov’s works—a principle of  his poetics—which while not exclusively involving language as such,  as the above examples do, nonetheless works toward similar ends.  Meerson sees Platonov’s works as dominated by a device she terms  “non-estrangement” (neostranenie). Her term consciously negates  that of “estrangement” (ostranenie) which Russian Formalist critics  in the early 1920s applied to what they saw as the defining trait of  art, its ability to render strikingly new and “strange” our otherwise  automatized perception of life (see for example Viktor Shklovsky’s  celebrated essay “Iskusstvo, kak priem” [“Art as Technique”]). What  Platonov’s texts do, rather, is to render ordinary and unnoticeable  169 </page> <page sequence="68"> Chapter Five what should be outrageous, fantastic, or tragic—thus, according to  Meerson, making the reader morally complicit in the acceptance of  such phenomena. Often enough this involves subtle linguistic shifts  of the kind discussed above. When the blacksmith-bear first appears,  for example, Platonov’s word-order is unexpectedly strange—or  rather, unstrange. The Russian text reads, “kuznets kachal mekhom  vozdukh v gorn, a medved’ bil chelovescheski molotom . . . ” (Kotlovan  89). As Meerson points out, up to this moment not a word has been  said about a bear. All the text prepares us to encounter is “the most  oppressed hired hand of all” (in fact the only exceptional thing about  him which the narrator remarks is that he is not a member of the  collective farm but a hired worker). Normal Russian word order  dictates that new information—such as the fact that this hired hand  is, in fact, a bear—be placed at the end of the phrase, i.e., one  would expect the text to read “a na koval’ne bil medved’ ” (“while at  the forge there hammered a bear”). The difference is close to that  in English between saying “the bear” and “a bear” (Meerson 22–3).  It is interesting that Chandler’s and Meerson’s translation faithfully  follows Platonov’s “non-estrangement” and says that “the bear was  hammering humanly at a strip on incandescent iron on the anvil”  (46), while Ginsburg, who in general tends to normalize, has “a bear  was striking a red-hot iron bar across the anvil with a hammer” (105;  emphasis added in both cases). What Platonov’s original Russian  text does is to introduce the figure of the bear as if it were not out  of the ordinary, indeed, as if it were something already known and  therefore not deserving of commentary.  In The Foundation Pit not only the fantastic (and ultimately  perhaps satirical) elements such as the anthropomorphic bear and  the self-collectivizing horses are subjected to this treatment; death  itself is as well. The matter-of-fact way in which the horse being  eaten alive by a dog merely “move[s] her legs a step forward, not  yet forgetting to live because of the pain” (Chandler/Meerson 113,  Ginsburg 100, Kotlovan 85) is characteristic, as are Meerson’s exam- ples of Prushevsky, who, matter-of-factly “having decided to pass  away . . . lay down on his bed and fell asleep” (Chandler/Meerson 24,  170 </page> <page sequence="69"> The Foundation Pit Itself Ginsburg 27, Kotlovan 34) and the deaths of Kozlov and Safronov,  which are not reported by the narrator at all but only relayed in  dialog by Nastya, who explains to Prushevsky why the coffin she  used to sleep in is being taken away (Meerson 101, 106). As Meerson points out, the (Russian) reader’s encounter of  these characteristic Platonovian passages usually involves an un- settling double-take. “If one carefully rereads Platonov’s texts one  often disc overs a meaning which either runs counter to what one  initially perceived or contradicts it altogether” (35). Reading Platonov  is a matter of learning to set aside expected clichés and perceive  what is truly there. “The reader automatically corrects the ‘deformed’  var iant of these clichés which are anticipated but in fact absent from  the actual text, driving off into his subconscious the literal message  of the text which is written in black and white and does not appear  to be hidden by anything” (36). It was for this reason that the  typists who had to prepare Platonov’s manuscripts for publication  would request triple the normal rate of pay—not because of his  handwriting, which was clear enough; but because it was impossible  with his texts, as it was possible for other writers, to remember  an entire phrase by looking at its first few words. Every word had to  be checked painstakingly to make sure the typescript followed what  Platonov had written (Taratuta 101). It is for this reason, too, that  the label “anti-utopia” is problematic in the case of The Foundation  Pit—appropriate as it ultimately may be. Everything that ought  to carry shock value if this were a straightforwardly anti-utopian  work, from flawed Stalinist ideology with its amoral class hatred  to the half-witted agents of its imposition and its tragic effects, is  buried beneath a mask of ordinariness, as though it scarcely merited  narrative comment. What the text instead thrusts to the foreground  is such otherwise unnoteworthy existential processes as being, the  beating of the heart, and breathing. It is as though, from a referential  perspective, the text were inverted. The cumulative effect of these various verbal and narrative  oddities in Platonov’s text is to create an idiom in which the lexicon of  ideology, of the Stalinist Five-Year Plan with all its utopian implications,  171 </page> <page sequence="70"> Chapter Five appears to merge unproblematically with the language of everyday  life—and in which therefore neither utopian nor tragic events any  longer call particular attention to themselves. Platonov’s characters  and narrator alike speak as though they did not understand the  difference between metaphoric and literal speech: the clichéd and  sometimes lurid metaphors that abound in the language of the Party- state thus appear to refer immediately to the physical world, while  everyday turns of phrase yield up chiliastic connotations. Platonov’s  language thus works something like a sustained pun. Puns, a type of  verbal behavior known as paranomasia, sound funny to us precisely  because for a moment they imply an essential relation between the  word and its referent that on further (nearly instantaneous) reflection  we realize to be absurd. But this response may in part be culturally  determined, because in certain periods of human history and in  certain cultures the semantic coincidence would have been taken  seriously and would even have been viewed as theologically justified.  In the New Testament, for example, there is a passage (Matthew  16:18) in which Jesus says to his disciple Peter (in the King James  Version): “And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter (Petros, in  the koine Greek in which the text was written—T.S.), and upon this  rock (petra) I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not  prevail against it.” It is unlikely in this instance that Jesus was trying  to be funny; rather, he meant to suggest an essential—rather than  accidental or random—relationship between the two terms. The  moment when Platonov’s paronomastic turns of phrase seem strangely  apt is precisely one in which the utopian motivations we sense behind  this kind of speech appear justified. It is a way in which, in a sense,  one—or Platonov—wishes one could speak about the world. The  moment our sense of linguistic propriety reasserts itself, however— that subsequent instant in which we realize that you cannot really  talk about the world this way—is precisely when the designs for  utopia begin to unravel. It is the tension between these two impulses  which defines the verbal atmosphere of Platonov’s tale. The language of The Foundation Pit resists convenient cate- gorization. Because it appears to be anchored in a linguistic con- 172 </page> <page sequence="71"> The Foundation Pit Itself sciousness which is at best semi-literate, it seems to affiliate itself  naturally with the skaz tendency in Soviet literature of the 1920s,  whose hallmark was unvarnished verbal naturalism; but the sudden  and dislocating semantic effects it produces seem to align it  instead with the kind of self-conscious modernist experimentation  with language that culminated in the “trans-sense” poetry of the  Futurists. As the critic Nikolai Zamoshkin aptly put it at the February  1932 meeting organized by the All-Russian Union of Soviet Writers  to discuss Platonov’s situation, “all Platonov’s works are infected with  purely literary anachronisms which come across sounding modernist”  (“ ‘ . . . Ia derzhalsia i rabotal’,” 110). If there is a parallel to Platonov’s  language in Russian modernism, perhaps it is to be found not in  literature but in the visual arts—in the distorted figures populating  the “primitive” peasant woodcuts of Mikhail Larionov, for example;  or, still closer, in the childishly crude figures in the paintings of  Pavel Filonov, whose contorted expressions and postures somehow  cumulatively lend the landscapes in which they are placed an air of  apocalyptic sorrow. SELECTED ANNOTATIONS OF EVENTS AND  SITUATIONS IN THE FOUNDATION PIT The following comments on Platonov’s text are meant to provide  political and historical background that may be unfamiliar to most  non-Russian readers. For fuller annotations, see Kotlovan (in Russian)  and Chandler/Meerson. “There was only a beer room for seasonal workers and low-paid  categories” (Chandler/Meerson 1; “low-paid trades,” Ginsburg 3):  in 1921–22 the Fourth All-Russian Conference of Trade Unions  developed a 17-tier system of pay categories, with fairly significant  differences between skilled and unskilled labor. It was revised in  1927–28, but the revision was criticized by Stalin for its “levelling”  173 </page> <page sequence="72"> Chapter Five tendences. A new, more hierarchical system was developed in 1931– 32 (Kotlovan 142 n. 5). “If you mean a plan of your private life, you could already have  worked that out in the club or else in the Red Corner” (Chandler/ Meerson 4; “the Red Reading Room,” Ginsburg 5): “Red Corners” or  “Lenin Corners” were first organized at the All-Russian Agricultural  and Crafts Exhibition in 1923, and spread throughout the country  following Lenin’s death in 1924. They were intended to replace the  “red corner” traditional in peasant huts, in which an icon was placed  (Kotlovan 144 n. 13). “Red” in old Russian means beautiful as well  as red, and may also have referred to the light of the candle kept  burning in front of the icon. “Red Corners” were stocked with political  reading matter. “The state, Voshchev, has given you an extra hour for this  thoughtfulness of yours” (Chandler/Meerson 5, Ginsburg 6): on the  tenth anniversary of the Revolution in 1927 the Central Executive  Committee of the Party issued a manifesto calling for a shift to  a seven-hour working day. In October 1929 Pravda forecast that by  1930 a million workers would have had their workday reduced by  an hour (Kotlovan 144 n. 15). “Voshchev stopped beside the cripple; from the depths of the  town a column of Pioneer children was advancing along the street”  (Chandler/Meerson 6, Ginsburg 8): the first All-Union Convention  of Pioneers was held in August 1929. Preparations for it, including  military marches and “Spartakiads” (athletic competitions), were  held throughout the country (Kotlovan 144 n. 17). “You should reinforce yourself with physical culture” (Chandler/ Meerson 27; “You ought to take up sports to strengthen yourself,”  Ginsburg 29): “physical culture” (fizkul’tura in its Soviet lexical hybrid)  or sports was declared a priority of the state in a 1930 declaration of  the Party’s Central Executive Committee. Its purpose was to “bring  174 </page> <page sequence="73"> The Foundation Pit Itself the broad masses of the workers and peasants together,” and it was  overtly politicized. One slogan of the campaign was “Sport Without  Class Content is a Dangerous Activity” (Kotlovan 149 n. 32). “Pashkin’s wife remembered the time Zhachev had denounced her  husband in a letter to the Provincial Party Committee” (Chandler/ Meerson 34; “Regional Party Committee,” Ginsburg 36): in Russian,  OblKK or “Oblastnaia kontrol’naia kommissiia.” An “oblast’ ” was  a regional geopolitical designation in the Soviet Union and now in  post-Soviet Russia. The regional “control committee” was the chief  party organ in a region charged with carrying out “purges” of the  Party, which reached a peak in 1929 (Kotlovan n. 34). These are  not to be confused with the far more sweeping and deadly purges  carried out under Stalin in the Great Terror of 1936–8. “But since the line is now directed toward technical specialists, please  lie down across from me so that you can constantly see my face and  go ahead and sleep boldly” (Chandler/Meerson 41; “But since we have  a clear line concerning specialists,” Ginsburg 43): the attitude toward  non-Party technical specialists in the 1920s and early 1930s ranged  from ambivalent to downright hostile. It intensified in particular after  the 1928 trial of the supposed “Shakhtinsky wrecker organization”  and relented little even when Stalin made statements affirming the  Party’s interest in attracting engineers and other specialists to Five- Year Plan projects (Kotlovan 150 n. 37). “Should we not install a radio so we can duly listen to achievements  and directives?” (Chandler/Meerson 49; Ginsburg 50): the first radio  station started broadcasting in the USSR in 1922, and by 1928  there were 23 transmitters (Kotlovan 151 n. 41). One of Platonov’s  notebooks for 1929–1930 has an entry which reads, “The collective  farms get by stimulating themselves with radio music; if the  loudspeaker breaks, that’s the end of it” (Zapisnye knizhki 35). The  screenplay “Mashinist” is less ambiguous than The Foundation Pit  about the coercive nature of the music coming from the radio. In it,  175 </page> <page sequence="74"> Chapter Five the activist sets up a radio and orders the peasants to dance. When  they slowly begin to do so he tells them that he will “dekulakize”  them, too, if they do not pick up the tempo and orders them to  wipe the tears that are streaming down their faces (238). At the  end of the screenplay a procession of villagers marches, in a parody  of an Orthodox religious procession bearing icons (see also “Rodina  elektrichestva”), to the river’s shore bearing on poles a loudspeaker,  radio equipment, and a large antenna. When they turn the radio on,  it plays music and the excavator blows its whistle in time with it. “Which is better—the ice-breaker ‘Krasin’ or the Kremlin?” (Chandler/ Meerson 60; Ginsburg 58): a ship in the Soviet arctic fleet. In 1928  it participated in the rescue of an expedition led by Umberto Nobile,  an Italian arctic explorer (Kotlovan 151 n. 43). “Stalin’s most important of all—and then Budyonny” (Chandler/ Meerson 64; “The chief one is Lenin [sic], and the one after him,  Budenny,” Ginsburg 62): Semyon Mikhailovich Budyonny (1883– 1973) was a military commander who during the Polish campaign  led the First Cavalry in which the writer Isaac Babel served as  a correspondent. It was also his First Cavalry which reclaimed  Voronezh, where Platonov was then working for the railroad, for  the Reds in 1919. In November 1928 in Pravda Budyonny had also  published his “Open Letter to Maxim Gorky” in which he severely  criticized Babel’s portrayal of his division in Red Cavalry (Kotlovan  151 n. 44). “Prushevsky looked quietly into all of nature’s misty old age and saw  at its end some peaceful white buildings that gave off more light  than was in the air around them” (Chandler/Meerson 67; Ginsburg  65): the buildings are clearly new structures that have gone up as  part of the Five-Year Plan. As Yuri Shcheglov has pointed out, one  way in which the poetics of the Soviet novel negotiated the distance  between an imperfect present and the utopian future was through  the manipulation of narrative focus. The “actual” plane of events,  176 </page> <page sequence="75"> The Foundation Pit Itself shown in effect in close-up and often situated in a relatively intimate  space like a communal apartment or government office, might  reveal negative phenomena; but the “ideal” plane of the historically- significant construction of socialism, typically identified with large- scale industrial projects, always stood in the wings, ready to be  deployed in order to restore the proper perspective. As Shcheglov  puts it, in the case of Ilya Il’f and Evgeny Petrov’s 1931 satirical  novel The Little Golden Calf (Zolotoi telenok), “the main form in  which the ideal plane exists in the novel, influencing its scale and  emotional tone, is that of a constant presence on the horizon, like  some distant chain of mountain peaks” (87). “We stacked those wooden coffins into the cave for future use— and now you’re digging up the whole gully” (Chandler/Meerson 69;  Ginsburg 66): in the original Russian it is clearer that the peasants  have not only stacked the coffins but acquired them and then began  paying for them in installments, an arrangment known in Russian  as samooblozhenie (Kotlovan 152 n. 48). There is an economic- ontological pun of sorts here: the root of the Russian term, oblozhenie,  connotes “covering oneself over with something,” and thus suggests  burial (or in a manner characteristic of Platonov, fuses the economic  and the physical meanings). A close English equivalent would be “we  got those coffins on the lay-away plan.” That the peasants have also  been sleeping in their coffins is a macabre literalization of an idea  in Fedorov’s philosophy, namely, that until humanity unites in the  “common task” of resurrecting its ancestors, people live a form of  death-in-life, subject to the destructive laws of the natural world. This  motif is developed even more extensively in Platonov’s screenplay  “Mashinist,” where the entire village occupies itself making coffins  and the activist dispatches the kulaks who are to be sent off on  the raft in a coffin pulled by a horse. He and the middle-peasant  (Seredniak) then ride in a horse-drawn coffin themselves to the  Organizational Yard, where he whistles for the peasants to gather  and forces them to dance to radio music. The rite of preparing one’s  coffin and lying in it in advance was widespread among Russia’s  177 </page> <page sequence="76"> Chapter Five Old Believers (schismatics who left the Orthodox Church in the  seventeenth century) between 1669 and 1702, when the end of the  world was expected (Kotlovan 153 n. 49). “Once the table groaned with fare/Now there’s just a coffin there”  (Chandler/Meerson 74; “Where formerly a laden table stood/There  stands a coffin now,: Ginsburg 70): Kozlov slightly garbles two lines  from a 1779 ode by Gavriila Derzhavin entitled “On the Death of  Prince Meshchersky.” Kozlov adds the adverb “formerly” (Kotlovan  154 n. 53). “Well and good, well and splendid, but what you have here, as the  saying says, is clearly a Rochdale cooperative rather than a Soviet  cooperative!” (Chandler/Meerson 75; Ginsburg 71): in 1844 a workers’  cooperative was organized in the Engish town of that name (Kotlovan  154 n. 54). Its organizers were disciples of Robert Owen, the “father  of English socialism” (Chandler/Meerson 169 n. 37). “The womb matrix for the house of future life was already complete”  (Chandler/Meerson 78; “The site for the building that would house  future life was ready,” Ginsburg 72): Ginsburg’s version conveys  the proper technical meaning of the term “matochnoe mesto” while  Chandler’s and Meerson’s more literal rendition captures its maternal  connotations. On the uterine associations of utopia in Platonov, see  Naiman, “Andrei Platonov and the Inadmissibility of Desire” 321. “The notice states that this was Socialized Property No. 7 of the  General Line Collective Farm” (Chandler/Meerson 80; Ginsburg 75):  “General Line” may simply refer to a phrase which was often used in  the 1920s and 1930s to denote the current policy of the Communist  Party; but one of Platonov’s Russian commentators, Natalia Korni- enko, suggests that it also alludes to a more specific event in Soviet  cultural life of 1929—the release of Sergei Eisenstein’s film “The Old  and the New,” work on which had been reported in the press since  1926 using the title “The General Line.” Kornienko also suggests that  178 </page> <page sequence="77"> The Foundation Pit Itself the sudden, unmotivated shifts between scenes in The Foundation Pit  may be intended as a literary approximation of Eisenstein’s technique  of montage (“Mashinist” 230; also Kotlovan 156 n. 63). “Out in the fresh air again, Chiklin and Voshchev met the activist— he was on his way to the reading hut on matters concerning the  cultural revolution” (Chandler/Meerson 101; Ginsburg 90): a 1929  resolution of the Communist Party’s Central Committee had pro- posed the creation of “councils of reading huts” in which courses  would be offered by cultural workers from various organizations  (Kotlovan 157 n. 68). “The women and girls diligently bent closer towards the floor and  began insistently writing letters, using the scratchy plaster” (Chand- ler/Meerson 102; Ginsburg 90): in 1929 the Communist Party’s  Central Committee passed a resolution “On the Liquidation of Illite- racy” and in 1930 made elementary education mandatory for all  Soviet citizens. The link between teaching literacy and political edu- cation was an intentional part of these policies (Kotlovan 157 n. 69). “Around the church grew the old forgotten grass of oblivion and  there were no paths or other signs of human passing—people had  evidently not been praying in the church for a long time” (Chandler/ Meerson 103; Ginsburg 92): the closure of churches was a cardinal  event of Stalin’s “Year of Great Change.” From November 1929 to April  1930 there was a nationwide antireligious campaign during which  churches and monasteries were closed, bells were removed from  church belfries (Metropolitan Sergii, head of the Orthodox Church,  announced in Pravda on 19 February 1930 that the bells were being  removed “at the request of the workers”), priests and believers were  put on trial, and antireligious departments were opened in Soviet  universities (Kornienko introduction to Zapisnye knizhki, 13; also  322, n. 19 and 333 n. 93) The women writing in chalk on “boards”  under the activist’s instruction in the anti-illiteracy scene are  probably writing on the backs of icons (Zapisnye knizhki 328 n. 56);  179 </page> <page sequence="78"> Chapter Five one of Platonov’s notebooks for 1929–30 has an entry which reads,  “From the icons of the saints (s likov sviatykh) the peasants write on  the floor with chalk” (Zapisnye knizhki 34). Another entry contains  an outline for a dialog: “ ‘Where are your bells?’ the Jewish worker  asks the Russian worker. ‘They took them down, the parasites.’ ‘Well  then, come over to my place, I’ll give you communion.’ ‘Ekh, I’ll kill  you, you parasite!’ ‘I know how to do it. I’ll place it in your mouth  with a little spoon’ ” (Zapisnye knizhki 27). The “circle of atheism”  (Chandler/Meerson 104; “Godless circle,” Ginsburg 93) refers to the  Union of Militant Atheists which existed in the Soviet Union from  1925–1947. By 1930 it had some two million members (Kotlovan  158 n. 73). “A raft’s being organized for tomorrow, so that the kulak sector  can travel down river and into the sea, and so further and so on”  (Chandler/Meerson 109; Ginsburg 96): expulsions downriver of  peasants accused of being kulaks actually took place in Russia during  the collectivization campaign (Kotlovan 159 n. 77). In the screenplay  “Mashinist” the kulaks are similarly placed on a raft and pushed down  river—by the excavator that has cleared the river of silt, no less.  Chapter Eleven of Gladkov’s Cement portrays a similar expulsion by  river of former members of the bourgeoisie, in the era of NEP rather  than the Five-Year Plan. “After liquidating all their last breathing livestock, the peasants  had begun to eat beef and had instructed all the members of their  households to do the same” (Chandler/Meerson 113; Ginsburg 100):  the campaign to collectivize Soviet agriculture led to widespread  slaughter of livestock to prevent it being taken over as collective  property. As a result there was a brief glut of meat on the market— followed by famine in 1931–32. In 1930 severe fines were imposed  for such slaugher (Kotlovan 159–60 n. 82). “ ‘Why are there flies when it’s winter,’ asked Nastya” (Chandler/ Meerson 122; Ginsburg 107): the flies have bred in the rotting  180 </page> <page sequence="79"> The Foundation Pit Itself carcasses of the livestock slaughtered by the peasants. One of  Platonov’s notebooks for 1930 contains an entry which reads, “Flies  in a blizzard.” (Zapisnye knizhki 43). There may be a remote literary  reminiscence in this image of a passage which occurs in the fourth  book of Virgil’s Georgics, which is entirely dedicated to bees and  their cultivation. Virgil proposes the ancient (and entirely fanciful)  remedy of bugonia (“generated by an ox or bull”) as a means to  replace a lost swarm: “it’s high time to tell of the Arcadian master’s  memorable/discovery and the way in which, often in those days,/the  rotting blood of a slaughtered ox has brought forth bees” (Virgil 69,  102). The positive tenor of Virgil’s reference, together with his use of  bees to symbolize ideal communal existence (“They alone hold their  offspring in common, share the houses/of their city, and live out  their lives under grand laws,” 65), suggest that Platonov’s portrayal  of collectivization negates the whole of this idyllic conceit. “no matter what, he would remain aware of the vanity of friendship  founded on dominance rather than on carnal love—and of the boredom  of the most distant stars, in whose depths lay the same copper ores  and which would need the same Supreme National Economic Soviet”  (Chandler/Meerson 145; Ginsburg 126): in Russian, Vysshii sovet  narodnogo khoziastva (known by its initials as VSNKh) was the  administrative agency given responsibility in a 5 December 1929  resolution by the Communist Party’s Central Committee for drawing  up economic, financial, and technical plans for the industrialization  campaign (Kotlovan 161 n. 88). 181 </page> <page sequence="80"> Chapter Five REFERENCES Averbakh, L. “O tselostnykh masshtabakh i chastnykh Makarakh.” Na li- teraturnom postu Nos. 21–22 (1929): 10–17.
