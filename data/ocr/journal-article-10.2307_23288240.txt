Bountiful, Utah: Hori zon Publishers 8c Distributors, 1997. 174 pp.; illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. $14.95. 0 88290-596-1 After reviewing the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, this book then spends a chapter summarizing what is known of the other siblings: the stillborn first child of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy (Johansen iden tifies this child as a daughter; other family records and memories iden tify it as a son),1 Alvin, Hyrum, Sophronia, Samuel Harrison, Ephraim, William, Catherine, Don Carlos and Lucy. Only four of these siblings were alive by the fall of 1844: the three sisters and William, none of whom affiliated with the Utah Church. Since the least is known about Joseph's sisters in their later lives, this section is per haps the most interesting; unfortu nately, it is quite brief and severely underdocumented. Separate chapters deal with Emma Hale Smith and the succes sion crisis, the departure from Nau voo, Emma's remarriage to Lewis Bidamon, and the subsequent ca reers of the four surviving sons (Joseph III, Alexander Hale, David Hyrum, and Frederick Madsen, who died as a young man). Rather confusingly, the author discusses Joseph Ill's death (chap. 7) before recounting his mission activities in Utah with his brothers, and Emma's death. This departure from chronology, however, allows Johansen to use Emma's final inter view with Joseph III affirming that Joseph Jr. had never practiced plu ral marriage as a transition to the last sixty pages, a discussion of po lygamy focused on the question: "How then can the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints justify practicing plural marriage from at least 1843 (maybe 1831) to 1905 and today excommunicate mem Joseph Sr., at a family blessing meeting on 9 December 1834, listed his losses: "The Lord, in his just providence has taken from me, at an untimely birth, a son: this has been a matter of affliction; . . . My next son, Alvin, as you all are aware, was taken from us. . . . Another [Ephraim] has been taken in his infancy" Dan Vogel, comp, and ed., Early Mormon Documents (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1996), 1:469.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 275 bers who practice plural marriage? (128) After an extensive review of the scriptural precedents and ex amples of plural marriage (this dis cussion includes Johansen's pub lished rebuke of a Newsweek re porter who described the Mormon belief in an anthropomorphic God as "literally a procreating father and that he is married to a Mrs. God, or divine mother" [131-33]), the author reviews the federal pres sures against nineteenth-century polygamy, the 1890 manifesto of Wilford Woodruff, and the 1904 Second Manifesto of Joseph F. Smith. This overview, while a suc cinct introduction, is probably too sketchy for the needs of most stu dents of Mormon history. Johansen concludes that the Church's differ ential policies about plural mar riage are actually unified by an un derlying principle: "Follow the liv ing prophet" (158).</page></plain_text>
