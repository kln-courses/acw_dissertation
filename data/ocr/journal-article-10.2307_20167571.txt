To accomplish the reconstruction I employ visual and material evidence in addition to the literary documents that are often used alone. I will first justify the use of these as necessary data. Aztec history: Some issues As is well known, the preconquest Aztecs did not record history with texts of any length. They used monuments and manuscripts with minimal pictographic and hieroglyphic notations, elaborated through oral recitation. The alphabetical sources that late modern historians use come from the colonial period. The products of both Spanish and native authors, they preserve some aspects of preconquest thought, but most are European-influenced adaptations of the material provided by oral informants, older (now lost) written documents, and pictorial manuscripts. To approach these sources critically, the scholar must understand differences between preconquest and postconquest native thought, colonial demands on Mexican historians, and the European ideas of history that guided them in making the data comprehensible and relevant to a new audience. Then he or she needs to consider how recent scholars, in turn, have reshaped the colonial texts. Late modern historians do acknowledge the early modern origin of their sources, but do they appreciate fully the problems and limitations? Few would say that colonial historians had the same agendas as contemporary historians, or that what "really happened" can be recuperated. Such old-fashioned attitudes have been revealed as increasingly problematic even in parts of the world where texts exist from the period of study. Late modern historians do acknowledge the presence of Hispanic insertions, especially comments on the Aztec religion, but do they recognize the less obvious re conceptions of the data in most examples? Do they think that knowledge of preconquest mental structures is necessary to reconstruction, or realize that some aspects are retrievable? My final question concerns the data of historical inquiry. Specifically, can one recreate an Aztec history that excludes the evidence of visual imagery and archaeological remains? The answer to this last query is no. Although the late modern historian usually restricts analysis to the written data that he/she was trained to study, the material sources should not be ignored, because too much is missed by not utilizing them. The archaeological remains are the actual detritus of Aztec events, and preconquest artworks embody intentional messages from the same time. The colonial pictorials, in turn, are the only survivals of an important lost class of preconquest materials that need to be considered along with the other evidence. To deal with this plethora of visual and archaeological materials, historians must have profound knowledge of the objects themselves and the interpretative methods, or collaborate with specialists who do. It is only through incorporation of multiple data sets, in fact, that the salient aspects of preconquest thought can be reconstructed. Now, at the turn of the twenty-first century, shifts in theories of knowledge allow for greater appreciation of native historical thought. It is understood that history is wedded to politics in a broad sense, and that there are potentially as many versions of events as interested parties, with no single version incorporating all agendas. Thus, the historian's recuperation is of different interpretations from different parties in different periods. 1. This is an expanded version of the paper titled "Notions of Aztec History" presented in The Romance of Historical Reconstruction Session at "West by Nonwest: The 50th Anniversary of Pre-Columbian Art History," a conference sponsored by Columbia University at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, November 10 to 12, 2000. The basic questions that inspired this analysis were raised previously by H. B. Nicholson and Eloise Qui?ones Keber (1983:52-55), Richard Townsend (1979:40-43), and Cecelia Klein (1987:318-324) in discussions of the Dedication Stone. I thank Esther Pasztory for suggesting and helping me shape the topic, an anonymous reviewer for helpful questions, and Gerardo Aldana, Terry Stocker, and Barbara Stark for important insights.</page><page sequence="3">88 RES 42 AUTUMN 2002 Some of these are nearer in time and space to what "really happened," and some are more distant Among them, even the more distant versions have interest as records of their own times and places. As a genre, history is distinguished from fiction by avowals of truth or fact and by the presence of named people whose actions take place in specified settings and time frames. But history shares with fiction its narrative structures and metaphorical connectors.2 The accepted parameters of historical recording and communication have been expanded also in ways that are more sympathetic to non-European forms. Now allowed for are oral and visual as well as literary communication systems, fragmented as well as whole expressions, metaphorical and poetic modes as well as secularized prose, and improvised presentations as well as memorized "texts." These changes in Western notions encourage the historian to incorporate native ideas of history into modern reconstructions, and to use non textual materials to do so.3 This is not to say that the interpretation of visual imagery and other material evidence is unproblematic. Aztec monuments project the changing, sometimes inconsistent views of Aztec politicians, rendered in terse, cryptic emblems. Moreover, political matters are couched in metaphorical imagery featuring supernatural actors and costumed humans, and the ideas behind these are not detailed visually. Even hieroglyphic names and dates function like the pictographic motifs that they accompany. As emblems that go beyond simple naming and dating, they are shorthand representatives of chains of unpictured associations. Like the pictographs, they served as clues to other links that are difficult to reconstruct because we do not know the reasoning behind their culturally defined chains of meaning. In other words, the monuments supply no recognizable narrative connections among motives. The question of "truth" in history is, of course, relative. Aztec images corresponded to truths current at the time of their creation, which included, in fact, reinterpretations of recent events to fit more recent ideas and circumstances. From our modern point of view, their messages might be characterized as manipulative, even recasting what the most critical historian would consider facts: what happened, when and where it happened, for what reason it happened, which actor/s it involved, and how they were dressed. No doubt, the preconquest manuscripts that have not survived had the same political motivations and limitations as the monuments. Their surviving postconquest descendants reflect and project additional colonial agendas, even in examples that look very native (Douglas 2000). Literary scholars are justified then in their belief that the remnants of preconquest happenings survive in their most complete forms in colonial alphabetical narratives and annalistic histories, and that these contain also many fragments of preconquest structures of thought and metaphors. No one would suggest abandonment of these great bodies of literary evidence. Aztec history and thought cannot be reconstructed through visual remains alone. On the most obvious level passages within the body of colonial literature recreate the contexts in which monuments were made. Fray Diego Dur?n's sixteenth century history of the Aztecs, for instance, includes discussions between rulers and their prime ministers about the imagery to be carved on monuments, aggressions launched to acquire materials, wars fought for sacrificial victims to initiate monuments, and various other steps in their creation.4 The focus of ceremonies on monuments in the central precinct of the city is highlighted also by their depiction in Dur?n's European style illustrations (fig. 1). But assertions of important commemorative functions aside, what historical evidence do actual monuments yield, given the limitations listed above? Primarily, they force us to revisit the complex and seemingly contradictory data associated with particular events in colonial sources, and to test these data. They 2.

Recent, original approaches to New World historiography are found in Rolena Adorno (1986), Susan D.

Authors of other classics of historical revisionism include Alfredo L?pez Austin (1973), Rudolph Van Zantwijk (1985), H. B. Nicholson (1978), Nigel Davies (1980), and Tom Zuidema (1990). Some of these New World studies use the visual materials with great skill and subtlety. 4. For the Spanish version, written between 1579 and 1581, see Duran 1967, vol. 2. For an English translation, see Doris Heyden's edition (Duran 1994), which is more faithful to the original manuscript. Parallel passages are found in the later cognate Cr?nica mexicana, which was written in about 1598 by Hernando Alvarado Tezoz?moc (1980), a descendant of the Aztec royal family. Duran and Alvarado Tezozomoc's accounts differ in details but are believed to have derived their basic outlines from a now lost manuscript, dubbed the Cr?nica X, written in the Aztec language by an earlier, probably native author using the newly acquired alphabetical writing system. Together the two manuscripts provide the most detailed colonial narrative surviving on the course of preconquest Aztec history.</page><page sequence="4">Umberger: Notions of Aztec history 89 fM/V 2$?

In the following, I am using preconquest remains and a colonial manuscript to supplement and question the alphabetical sources. My purpose is to reveal how the Aztecs staged a series of ritual and historical events, while also accommodating unanticipated happenings. I am addressing here only the contribution of monumental data, as this particular series of events has little in the way of archaeological remains other than the architectural structure that was the result of the building expansion (probably Phase VI of the Templo Mayor). The Aztec calendar: Structures and symbolism Necessary to this reconstruction is an explication of the functioning of the 260-day divinatory cycle (tonalpohualli, "count of divinatory days") within the months of the 365-day solar year (cemilhuitlapohualli, "count of feast days"), and the relationships of both to the fifty-two-year cycle (xiuhmolpilli, "bundle of years").5 After the conquest, Spanish friars like Bernardino de Sahag?n (1950-1982:bks. 2 and 4-5) described the two day-counts separately. This is not surprising, as no European writing at the time understood how they worked together. Even today, they are treated as separate systems in all but numerical respects. Since the hieroglyphic dates on monuments derived their names from the 260-day divinatory count (here called the Trecena Cycle), that count is of particular interest. In the past two decades, study of these inscribed dates together with hieroglyphic names, imagery, and style have made it possible to place many monuments in their approximate years of ritual use (Umberger 1981a and elsewhere). Their more exact placement within the years themselves requires a detailed reconstruction of how the different counts worked together. The events to be highlighted in a ritual year were determined by specialists who saw the course of the 5. The name of the conjunction of days of the 365-day cycle is unclear. I prefer the term cemilhuitlapohualli to the one chosen by Tena (1987:11), xiuhtlapohualli ("year count"), in his discussion of both terms.</page><page sequence="5">90 RES 42 AUTUMN 2002 present as linked to the course of the past. Aztec records of the past probably originally featured a continuous and intertwined sequence of events that colonial scholars subsequently categorized separately as myth and history. In this reconception they relegated obviously cosmic and mythical aspects to the deep past and secularized the later period, which they considered history proper. The Aztecs themselves had cast this later period in more human terms, but colonial historians furthered the process by removing the metaphorical underpinnings. The resulting distinction between periods, which continues in late modern scholarship, creates a distorted view of non-European thought. Emphasizing the fictional aspects of mythic events in order to negate their historicity, historians at the same time dismiss as irrelevant figurative aspects that were crucial to Aztec historical thought. This is a profound mistake, as it disrupts intimate, culturally defined connections between different event-types; much from the mythic period, in fact, formed typological precedents for later history. The historical accounts of early colonial times begin with this distant mythic period,6 consisting of four eras dominated by their respective suns and the Fifth Era in which the Aztecs lived. They then proceed through the initiatory events of the Fifth Era, followed by the rise and fall of important ancient "Toltec" polities and the events of Aztec hegemony. Developing further a mode of thought suggested by scholars like Richard Townsend (1979:70), I believe that the later political happenings were seen as repetitions related in type to the primordial events. Some primary links were date names, for instance, the year dates in the fifty-two-year cycle (fig. 3) which called up the specific associations listed beside them. However, the structural relationship between past and present was conceived more flexibly when it was necessary to link events of different dates. In these cases, solar metaphors were used to relate all types of events and their actors. Comparisons involved the sun's cyclical positions: its dawning in the east, climb to the zenith, eclipse, descent/setting in the west, and travel through the Underworld. These positions were used to represent the beginning, success, decline/failure, and end of human lives, political reigns, calendar cycles, and periods of agricultural fertility (Umberger 1987; in process). In addition, the moon, stars, and earth had their own metaphorical correspondences, usually in relation to the sun. Over the span of the ritual calendar the effect was the integration of cosmic and human events into a sequence of alternating light and dark periods. The linkage between cosmic events and human political activities is clearly made in the charter story underpinning the Aztec system of thought, one version of which is most fully documented in Sahag?n's Florentine Codex (1950-1982:bk. 3:1-5). This account describes the rise of the Aztec tribal god, Huitzilopochtli ("hummingbird, left"), as a struggle against other anthropomorphic gods, following his birth fully armed from a woman named Coatlicue ("serpents, her skirt") at a mountain site called Coatepetl ("serpent mountain"). The battle ended in Huitzilopochtli's slaughter of an army of enemies, his brothers the Centzonhuitznahua' ("400 [or innumerable] southerners"), and their leader, his sister Coyolxauhqui ("bells, painted") (fig. 2). Being the Aztec tribal god, Huitzilopochtli's rise to power symbolized the Aztecs' political rise, his enemy siblings represented their enemies, and his "sister'Vleader represented a ruler who was transformed in defeat into a woman (Umberger in process). The cosmic correspondences of settings, actors, and actions of the story are widely recognized, as are the political dimensions. Coatepetl and Coatlicue both represent the earth, while Huitzilopochtli's "birth" is like the sun rising in the morning from the earth to defeat the moon and stars (Seler 1960-1961, 3:327-328; 4:157-167; Umberger 1987). It is also well known that the setting of the story was in the city of Tenochtitlan in the form of the pyramid-mountain of the Templo Mayor, which represented Coatepetl, and nearby structures, like the ballcourt and skull rack. In this setting, contemporary events were staged to follow the events of the past?the "historical" past of the Chichimecs and Toltecs, as well the distant mythical past. Thus, in addition to Coatepetl, the forms and decorations of buildings referred to revered cities like Calixtlahuaca, Culhuacan, Tenayuca, Xochicalco, Tula, and Teotihuacan. Unfortunately, the layout of these structures in the city is relatively vague at this point; but ceremonial activities focusing on them can be "mapped" in time. Given the importance of connecting the past and present, the priests who scheduled events had to consult both the "books of days" (tonalamatl), which pictured the deity-actors and event possibilities of days in the Trecena Cycle, and the "books of years" (xiuhamatl), 6. I suggest use of the terms metaphorical and figurative when appropriate to replace mythical, as they bypass the distracting issue of belief (that is, the assumption that non-Western systems of thought involved unanimous belief by the members of a society). The early period of Aztec history can still be called myth, with the proviso that its allegorical functions be recognized.

The proper course of action could be determined only through balancing the locations of particular days within the calendar's structure with the associations their names had accumulated through past experiences. Modern scholars have convincingly correlated the Aztec 365-day solar year with years in the European calendar, as seen in figures 3, 4, and 5. Aztec years bore the names Tochtli ("rabbit"), Acatl ("reed"), Tecpatl ("flint knife"), and Calli ("house"), which are called "year signs" by modern scholars. Each year in the fifty-two year cycle had a distinct name, resulting from the combination of the four signs alternating in order and joined with the numbers 1 through 13. This pairing of signs and numbers was repeated four times (fig. 3). The fifty-two-year cycle was not used solely to name passing units of time, as it is now treated (e.g. Caso 1967). It was a great ceremonial cycle that reiterated the events of pre-Aztec and Aztec history in a meaningful sequence. In the deep or "real" time of annals like the Historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas (1973), the Leyenda de los soles (1975), the Anales de Cuauhtitlan (1975), Alvarado Tezozomoc's Cr?nica mexic?yotl (1975), the Anales de Tlatelolco (1980), and Chimalpahin's Relaciones originales (1965), the events spanned many cycles, but within the fifty-two-year cycle these same events were celebrated according to date in a compressed and reordered sequence (fig. 3).7The first year was 1 Tochtli, the anniversary of the separation of the earth and sky of the Fifth Era. The second year, 2 Acatl, celebrated the lighting of the first fire and "smoking of the sky" by the god Tezcatlipoca ("mirror, its smoke"), while the world was still without a sun. At the beginning of the second quarter, 1 Acatl was a year date pertaining principally to Quetzalcoatl ("feathered serpent"), the legendary deified ruler of the Aztecs' most admired predecessors, theToltecs of Tollan (modern Tula, Hidalgo). At the middle of the year count, 13 Acatl and 1 Tecpatl were the anniversary years of the births/first appearances of the sun and the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli, respectively. Although separated by many years in "real" time, the juxtaposition of their dates in the fifty-two-year cycle emphasized the Aztecs' close ties of dependency and responsibility to the sun.8 This juxtaposition also signaled well-known social and political metaphors, wherein the rising sun was synonymous with success, as indicated before. In the case of the fifty-two-year cycle, the successful dominance of the Aztec god over all others was conceived metaphorically as another sunrise. The date 13 Acatl was simultaneously the year of the birth of the moon. Having lost a contest with the sun, the moon became a pale, nighttime reflection of the brighter orb, and a metaphorical analogue of all forces losing to the Aztecs. The year after 1 Tecpatl, 2 Calli, was the 7. See Umberger 1981a:209-212, 200-206, and Umberger 1981 b for the sources of associations of dates to events and gods. 8.

The third year after 1 Tecpatl, 4 Acatl, was the anniversary of the beginning of the Aztec Triple Alliance Empire of Tenochtitlan, Tlacopan, andtexcoco in 1431-1432. The first year of the fourth quarter, 1 Calli, was the anniversary of the foundation of Tenochtitlan's "twin" city, Tlatelolco, on the same island in 1337-1338. Obviously, the first half of the cycle meshed pre Aztec cosmic and political events, while the second half, beginning with 1 Tecpatl, was dominated by the Aztecs and comprised a great period of symbolic solar light. Actually, several layers of history, and alternating periods of light and dark, were accommodated in this and other temporal cycles. First were creation events involving the sun, sky, moon, stars, earth, and Underworld, and cosmic struggles between forces of darkness and light. Second were events associated with theToltecs: a period of Chichimec-like migration, urbanization at Tula, and finally the golden age of Quetzalcoatl's rule and his struggle with Tezcatlipoca. The triumph of Tezcatlipoca brought a return of symbolic darkness and political divisiveness. Third were events associated with the Aztecs?the ones destined to unite this divided world?from their own migration period to their urban settlement at Tenochtitlan. Through the experiences of the migration period (including the events at Coatepetl) and their early settlements in the Valley of Mexico, they eventually became worthy inheritors of Toltec culture. Having divided into two groups and settling on the islands of Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco in LakeTezcoco in the early fourteenth century, they gained independence from their Tepanec overlords in 1 Tecpatl, 1428-1429. After the formation of the Triple Alliance Empire four years later in 1431 1432, they could then realize their Toltec-inherited right to political hegemony. Each year in the fifty-two-year cycle consisted of 365 days, divided into eighteen month-like veintenas (Spanish for the twenty-day periods), plus five leftover days (figs. 4 and 5). Overlapping this Veintena Cycle were multiple occurrences of the Trecena Cycle, each of which consisted of twenty week-like trecenas (Spanish for the thirteen-day periods). The veintenas, like months, occupied the same positions in every year, and they were named for activities that took place during the twenty days. The last day of each veintena was its feast day. The day that gave its name to the year (called the year-bearer) was found in the same two positions every year, first as the feast day of Veintena IV (Hueitozoztli, "great vigil") and second as the feast day of Veintena XVII (Tititl, "stretching/shrinking"). The symbolic course of the veintenas is poorly understood; their activities as reported in colonial sources are complex to the point of incomprehensibility as a system. Still, it may be said that, whatever the individual emphases of different years, the typical course of veintenas was directed toward a climax of public ceremonies on the second year-bearer day at an important temple. In addition, preparation for these ceremonies probably began in Veintena XI (Ochpaniztli, "sweeping") with the ceremonial refurbishing of the city's temples. In contrast to the veintenas, the trecenas, like weeks, changed their positions in the year. The days of the Trecena Cycle were named through the combination of the numbers 1 through 13 with twenty non-numerical signs, among them the four year-signs. Since the Veintena and Trecena Cycles ran together, each day had a name and position in an individual trecena plus a position in an individual veintena. In the year 4 Acatl (fig. 4) the first day of Veintena 1, Atlcahualo, was called 3 Ocelotl ("jaguar") for its position in the Trecena Cycle. It could also be designated as the first day of Atlcahualo, or Atlcahualo 1. As time passed, the trecenas changed position in relation to the veintenas. Thus, the first day of each year was always Atlcahualo 1, but it was 3 Ocelotl only once in a fifty-two-year cycle. At the tops of the diagrams in figures 4 and 5 are the veintena names in N?huatl and English. Below them are the Roman numerals that indicate their ordering, and above them are their month and day dates in the present European calendar. Along the left sides are the twenty day-signs of the Trecena Cycle, numbered 1 through 20 to indicate their positions within the year's veintenas. In the body of each diagram the matching of the day-signs with the repeating sequence of numbers 1 through 13 yields the names of individual days. Trecena 1, the first of every cycle begins with the day 1 Cipactli ("caiman")?the first numeral plus the first sign?and proceeds to 13 Acatl. Trecena 2 begins with 1 Ocelotl and proceeds to 13 Miquiztli ("death"), and so on. The four day-signs that shared names with the fifty two years also shared the associated gods and event types of particular dates, and this symbolic aspect tied the day and year cycles together.

Like year-sign dates, non-year-sign dates could be linked to deities, different aspects of a single deity, and, of course, associated event-types. For instance, the non-year-sign date 1 Miquiztli was dedicated to Tezcatlipoca. All days with special associations, whether year signs or not, are called "moveable feast days'' by modern scholars (we do not know their Aztec name), and the Aztecs had to acknowledge the gods and actions attached to them, no matter where the days fell in the Veintena Cycle. It should be noted also that moveable feast days that coincided with veintena feast days were doubly important. Acatl years, like those diagrammed in figures 4 and 5, had more of these coincident dates than other years, because the feast days 13, 7, 1, 2, and 4 Acatl all had symbolic associations in the Trecena Cycle. In the year 8 Acatl these were the feast days of ten of the eighteen veintenas. Like the macro-cycle of the fifty-two years, the micro cycle of the trecenas reiterated the events of history, but within a period of days. Because of their shared system of named dates, the symbolic associations of the years were transferred to the Trecena Cycle, where they followed the same general sequence, although altered somewhat by the insertion of the sixteen additional signs (their sequence can be followed in figure 5). The day that I believe began the sequence was 1 Tochtli, which bore the same name as the first year of the Fifth Era and the first year of the fifty-two-year cycle, but it was in the final trecena of a waning Trecena Cycle. Thirteen days later, 1 Cipactli (a non-year-sign) began the next cycle. This day-name symbolized the initiation of time (Sahag?n 1950-1982:bks. 4-5:1). Time having been a crucial instrument of political control, 1 Cipactli, not surprisingly, was an appropriate day for Aztec ruler coronations (Duran 1994:318).9 Thirteen days later, 13 Acatl commemorated the appearance of the sun, just as the year 13 Acatl did in the fifty-two-year cycle (Caso 1927:35-36; Umberger 1981a:203-204). Four days after that, in Trecena 2, 4 Ollin ("movement") celebrated the day when the sun began to move (Sahag?n 1950-1982: bks. 4-5:6). The seventh day of Trecena 3, 7 Acatl, initiated an important twenty-day period devoted to Quetzalcoatl (Codex Telleriano-Remensis, f. 10r; in Qui?ones 1995:23, 168). The period ran through Trecena 4 and ended on 1 Acatl, the first day of Trecena 5. Both 7 Acatl and 1 Acatl years were devoted to Quetzalcoatl in the fifty-two-year cycle too (on the year 7 Acatl, see Umberger, 1981a:98-105, 127-132; on 1 Acatl, see also Sahag?n 1950-1982:bks. 4-5:29). Trecena 6 began with 1 Miquiztli, the day devoted to Tezcatlipoca as "enslaver of men" (ibid.: 33-36) and the first of an important fifty-two-day period of darkness, devoted to him and to Huitzilopochtli before the latter's (solar) rise. Trecena 7 began with 1 Quiahuitl ("rain"), a day of sacrifices in honor of the current ruler (ibid.:42). After this, in Trecena 8, at the approximate middle of the fifty-two-day period, 2 Acatl was another day of Tezcatlipoca (ibid.:56), this time as fire-lighter, the date and activity being the same as in the fifty-two-year cycle. The period ended with 1 Tecpatl at the beginning of Trecena 10, a day, like 1 Tecpatl in the year count, dedicated to Huitzilopochtli's "dawning" (ibid.:77-79). As in the fifty-two year cycle, in the Trecena Cycle the celebration of the successful Huitzilopochtli was a metaphorical repetition of the cosmic, solar event on 13 Acatl, and signified his dominance over all other gods. The symbolic structure of the Trecena Cycle had some similarities with that of the Fifty-two-year cycle. In both, 1 Tecpatl marked the passage of half a cycle since 1 Tochtli, although a different number of units was involved (130 days in the Trecena Cycle and twenty-six years in the fifty-two-year cycle). In addition, in both cycles the first half contained the important dates of creation events and the powerful pre-Aztec gods, while the more specifically Aztec dates fell at the center and in the second half. Within these general outlines, there are differences in details, notably in the sequence of date names as well as the number of units of time between them, which vary greatly. For instance, in the fifty-two-year cycle, the date 2 Acatl is immediately after 1 Tochtli. In the Trecena Cycle 2 Acatl occurs 105 days after 1 Tochtli (approximately six trecenas), even after the birth of the sun and the activities of Toltec Quetzalcoatl. Likewise, the dates of the sun's birth, 13 Acatl, and Huitzilopochtli's rise, 1 Tecpatl, which are in adjacent years at the center of the fifty-two-year cycle, are separated by 105 days in the Trecena Cycle. However, sense can be made of even such radical changes, in that the deities who ruled these dates were 9. Note that 1 Tochtli and 1 Cipactli were both initiatory trecenas straddling the border between Trecena Cycles. This type of doubling was necessary to ease transition between both day and year cycles and to avoid the danger inherent in abrupt, impermeable boundaries (see also Broda 1969:44). Similarly, a Trecena Cycle bridged the end of one fifty-two-year cycle in the year 13 Calli, 1505-1506, and the beginning of the next in 1 Tochtli, 1506-1507, as I will explain in future work. A single day on which all cycles ended would have been a very dangerous time; so the occurrence of such a day was made numerically impossible by the structure of the calendar. In other words, no year began on the day 1 Cipactli, the first day of the Trecena Cycle.</page><page sequence="12">Umberger: Notions of Aztec history 97 placed in the same cosmic scenarios in both year and day cycles. Tezcatlipoca lights fire during a time of darkness, and Huitzilopochtli rises like the sun at the end of the period.10 The most important change from the fifty-two-year cycle to the Trecena Cycle was the emphasis placed on the political sequence of the gods Quetzalcoatl, Tezcatlipoca, and Huitzilopochtli, who represented the Toltecs, their post-Toltec successors, and the Aztecs, respectively. In historical sources all three deities had been involved in creation but returned many year cycles later in altered forms as political patrons. Quetzalcoatl, for a while the successful ruler of Tollan, was then defeated and driven from that city by Tezcatlipoca (Nicholson 1957; L?pez 1973). By early Aztec times Tezcatlipoca had become the patron god of the powerful Tepanec and Acolhua polities in the Valley of Mexico, but, with the rise to dominance of Aztec Tenochtitlan, he became a "cadet" to the Aztec patron god, Huitzilopochtli (Umberger 1996b:250-251, and in process). In the Trecena Cycle, although the time periods devoted to these gods fall after the events of cosmic creation, some of their actions are comparable in being originary and primordial as much as political (for instance, Tezcatlipoca's fire-lighting and Huitzilopochtli's solar emergence). Or, it might be said that the political significance of events was backed by supernatural powers. Given the complex reappearance of actors and comparable events on specific dates, as each Trecena Cycle passed, there were simultaneous celebrations of happenings from different periods on the moveable feast days. In other words, although the sequence of dates in the Trecena Cycle, with its greater number of units, mimicked more closely the sequence of "real history" than did the fifty-two-year cycle, it was still a condensed version. The cosmic, Toltec, post-Toltec, and Aztec periods outlined above recurred in that relative order, but references to the different periods also overlapped. Thus, the ceremonial costumes worn on days of significance in several cycles conflated political and cosmic powers in ways that we do not yet understand. Having established the complexity of references in the ceremonies of the Trecena Cycle alone, another important questions arise: how did the veintenas 10. The other important symbolic dates in the fifty-two-year cycle?2 Calli, 4 Acatl, and 1 Calli?do not make comparable sense in their patterning, and perhaps they were not conceived as part of this important sequence in the Trecena Cycle. 7 Acatl also takes radically different positions in the two counts. accommodate the appearance of supernatural powers on the moveable feast days, and how were contemporary historical events inserted? The question of historical commemoration brings up again the interrelationship of days and years. Some historical events could be scheduled for the anniversary year, such as the celebrations in honor of the appearance of the sun and Huitzilopochtli that must have taken place in the years 13 Acatl and 1 Tecpatl (1479-1481), but the Aztecs also had to celebrate such charter events in years of other names. Five kings ruled during the fifty-two-year cycle from 1 Tochtli to 13 Calli, 1454 to 1506 (fig. 3), but 13 Acatl and 1 Tecpatl fell only within the reign of one of these, Axayacatl. In the cases of the other reigns, the celebrations of important events had to be transferred to days of the same names in the Trecena Cycle. In the day cycle every significant anniversary date recurred at least once a year, and less predictable events such as rulers' deaths and accessions could be scheduled either on fixed day dates, like 1 Cipactli, or other, variable but appropriate dates. This use of the day-names to represent years did not solve all problems of scheduling. Because of the changing positions of the trecenas within the individual years, their overlap within the veintenas changed too. Sometimes the overlap was not propitious. In years like 4 Acatl (fig. 4), the symbolically important 130-day period from 1 Tochtli to 1 Tecpatl fell in the middle of the year, ending long before the year's proper ceremonial climax at the end of the penultimate veintena. Perhaps this split was not a problem for some types of commemorations, but the sequence of days in other years, like 8 Acatl (fig. 5), allowed a ritual schedule in which the ceremonial climaxes of both Trecena and Veintena Cycles coincided, an important co-occurrence for major celebrations. Although the different lengths of trecenas and veintenas produced differences like these between years, balance and linkage could be achieved by taking advantage of certain regularities. First, the beginning and end days of the eighteen veintenas bore the same signs within acatl, tecpatl, calli, and tochtli years, respectively. In acatl years all veintenas began with ocelotl days and ended with acatl feast days. In tecpatl years the veintenas began with quiahuitl days and ended with tecpatl days, in calli years they began with cuetzpalin ("lizard") days and ended with calli days, and in tochtli years they began with atl ("water") days and ended with tochtli days. Years of the same sign were comparable also in that their feast days, in addition to having the same sign as the year itself, followed a set sequence.

Drawing by author (from Qui?ones 1995:80). second regularity characteristic of every year was the exact repetition of the day-names of the first five veintenas, I through V, in the last five veintenas, XIV through XVIII. Among these matching periods were the two veintenas that ended with the year-bearer days; near the beginning of the year was Veintena IV, Hueitozoztli ("great vigil"), and near the end was Veintena XVII, Tititl ("stretching/shrinking"). The Aztecs could use this coincidence to stage complementary actions in earlier and later veintenas, especially in the year-bearer veintenas. A third regularity involved the location of the year-bearer of the previous year of the same sign. Just as the year-bearers of a current year had set positions within the year, so too did the day of this name; it was always in the middle of the 360-day block formed by the eighteen veintenas. For instance, in the year 8 Acatl the day in the middle of the veintena block, 4 Acatl, was the year-bearer of the previous acatl year. This feature reinforced the close relationship between years of the same sign, and could be used to justify a transferral of ceremonies from one year to another of comparable structure four years later. Obviously, the scheduling of a year's rituals was a difficult task and involved numerous decisions, as will be seen in the historically documented example of the temple expansion initiated by Tizoc and completed by Ahuitzotl. The structural aspects and regularities of the system are outlined above. In the following, I will reconstruct an actual schedule of events, contrasting what Pierre Bourdieu (1977) would characterize as structure or "theory" and actuality or "practice." The building of the Great Temple by Tizoc and Ahuitzotl The cumulative evidence of various sources indicates that the dedicatory ceremonies at the Templo Mayor honored different stages of the expansion during its construction from 1483 to 1488, the Aztec years 4 Acatl to 8 Acatl. It is also evident that ceremonies were patterned in both year and day cycles to follow the events leading up to Huitzilopochtli's triumph on the hill of Coatepetl, which the temple represented. As will be seen, some sacrificial victims were dressed as actors at Coatepetl and are pictured in Telleriano-Remensis as the</page><page sequence="14">Umberger: Notions of Aztec history 99 Figure 7. Codex Telleriano-Remensis, folio 39r. Events of the years 6 Cal I i through 8 Acatl, 1485-1488. Biblioth?que Nacionale, Paris. Drawing by author (after Qui?ones 1995:81). foci of the major rituals of 5 Tecpatl, 1485-1486, but the details of this year cannot be reconstructed more specifically. However, in the fifth and final year, 8 Acatl, 1487-1488, manuscript illustrations, sculptures, and alphabetical histories allow for the reconstruction of activities within both the Trecena and Veintena Cycles. Logically, the climactic ceremonies were in the penultimate month of the year, and these focused on the great sacrifice dedicating the completed temple. This was followed by the triumph of the god Huitzilopochtli early in the following year. The events of the 1480s are documented in multiple colonial sources, but none is more important for the present purpose than the pictorial Codex Telleriano Remensis (figs. 6 and 7), which although well known has not been exhausted as a historical source. Folio 38v documents the years 4 Acatl and 5 Tecpatl, when the pyramid platform was enlarged over an earlier temple. The next page, Folio 39r, depicts the completed shrines on top of the platform and other events of 6 Calli, 7 Tochtli, and 8 Acatl. The whole sequence begins with the death of the ruler Axayacatl and the succession of Tizoc. This change in leadership is depicted as having happened in the year 4 Acatl, 1483-1484, but other sources indicate that it probably occurred two years earlier in 2 Calli, 1481-1482 (whether this is true or not is not important to the argument). Also below 4 Acatl the foundation is laid forTizoc's new temple, and a sacrificial victim is offered at this time, a matching of event to year that is probably accurate, for reasons that will become clear later. The second vignette, under the year 5 Tecpatl (1484 1485), pictures the finished pyramid with the symbol of Tenochtitlan on top (a cactus, tenochtli, growing from a stone, tetl). Below to the left a male prisoner is pictured; to the right is a nude woman, who was apparently beaten to death by the warrior next to her. Her body looks like several monumental depictions of the goddess Coyolxauhqui in her sprawled position and emphasized breasts (Garcia and Arana 1978; Matos 1991). The Spanish gloss on the lower part of the page names the male prisoner as one of those from Tzinacantepec, a town in the imperial province of Matlatzinco. The picture tells us that both victims were dispatched before</page><page sequence="15">100 RES 42 AUTUMN 2002 Figure 8. The Stone of Tizoc, probably initiated with the sacrifice of victims from the Matlatzinco area in 5 Tecpatl, 1484-1485. Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a, Mexico. Photograph courtesy of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog?a e Historia, Mexico. the shrines were added, and seemingly the female was killed before the male. The male figure actually stands for a number of victims from the Matlatzinco area, while the female may have been singular. Given that the artificial mountain was an image of Coatepetl, it would be logical to identify both figures as representatives of Huitzilopochtli's enemies, who were defeated there. The completion of the mountain base then was commemorated with the sacrifice of atavars of the enemy siblings, the female Coyolxauhqui and the male Centzonhuitznahua', probably all represented by Matlatzinca captives.11 This evidence from the pictorial manuscript allows for the dating of one well-known sculpture. Usually attributed to this temple phase, its initial use can now be dated more specifically to the time of these sacrifices. This is the Stone of Tizoc (fig. 8), a sacrificial platform featuring a colossal image of the sun on its upper surface and conquered enemies grasped by Aztec victors around the perimeter. Costume parts label the winners 11. Note the similarities between figures 2 and 6, although the one who defeats Coyolxauhqui in figure 6 seems not to be Huitzilopochtli (in fact, recognizable deities are not represented in this part of the historical section of Telleriano-Remensis). as likeToltecs and the losers as like Chichimecs, while the atl atls of the latter establish them as former nobility or rulers?that is, as former "Toltecs." Symbolically, Chichimecs were comparable to vassals and commoners, while Toltecs were comparable to rulers and nobles. The Aztec viewer would have seen the conquered enemies also as like the mythical Cenzonhuitznahua', the defeated sibling-enemies of Huitzilopochtli (see Umberger 1996a and in process). Finally, since the featured conquest on the monument pictures the ruler Tizoc, dressed as Huitzilopochtli and identified by his name sign, taking a prisoner labeled as from the Matlatzinco area (fig. 9), the Tizoc Stone must have been created for the 5 Tecpatl sacrifice of the Matlatzinca prisoners. The great greenstone Coyolxauhqui Head, another sculpture generally thought to have belonged to the same phase of the temple (Pasztory 1983:153; Nicholson and Qui?ones 1983:48-51), could have been put in place at the same time.12 So, as they completed the stages of each enlargement of the Templo Mayor, the Aztecs seemingly 12. Alternatively, it may have been finished later, after the death of Tizoc, as implied in a passage in Dur?n's history (1994:328). Its particular date is not important to the argument of this article.</page><page sequence="16">Umberger: Notions of Aztec history 101 Figure 9. The ruler Tizoc's conquest of the representative of the Matlatzinco area, one of fifteen conquest scenes on the Stone of Tizoc. Drawing by author. installed sculptures corresponding to the actors and actions in the myth. On Folio 39r, no action is pictured for the next year date, 6 Calli (1485-1486), but in the following year, 7 Tochtli (1486-1487), Tizoc is depicted as having died and been succeeded by his brother Ahuitzotl. Both are seated on thrones. The scene under 8 Acatl (1487-1488) is the most complex in the historical section of the codex. The completed temple is represented with the shrines of Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli on top (reversed for some reason). Around it are scattered various emblematic motifs. To the left of the temple the ruler Ahuitzotl appears a second time on his throne. Below the temple a symbol of the lighting of a "new fire" at the structure is attached to the place glyph of Tenochtitlan. Further below and to the right three sacrificial victims (no doubt, conceived as other Centzonhuitznahua') are labeled with hieroglyphs as from Xiuhcoac, Cuetlaxtlan, and possibly Tezapotitlan, three places in the eastern part of the empire where Ahuitzotl had waged war earlier in the year. At the bottom of the scene are the hieroglyphs that give the total number of victims at the dedication ceremony as 20,000 (Qui?ones 1995:225). The pyramid having already been initiated in Tizoc's time, this ceremony actually celebrated the shrines, with the completion of Huitzilopochtli's "house," no doubt after that of the ancient earth and rain god Tlaloc. I suggest that the motifs and form of the Tizoc Stone indicate that this king, on commissioning it for the sacrifice of prisoners from Matlatzinco, also anticipated its use in the ceremony at the completed temple several years later. The Cr?nica X accounts of Duran and Alvarado Tezozomoc assert that captives from all over the empire were sacrificed at the temple dedication (Carrasco 1999:419), and, asTownsend (1979:43-49) has pointed out, the stone is an ?mage of the empire in cylindrical form. On it, each captive stands for a conquered province, representing those that Tizoc anticipated to be dispatched in the final ceremony (Umberger 1998). The cosmic layout of the Tizoc Stone also echoes the spatial diagram traced by the participants in the ceremony described by Duran and Alvarado Tezozomoc. Captives from the different provinces formed four lines along the causeways of the city and converged at the center, to be sacrificed by Ahuitzotl, his prime minister Tlacaelel, and the kings of Texcoco and Tlacopan, the other Triple Alliance members. The Tizoc Stone represents a world divided into four quarters, like the city itself, by the flinty teeth of the</page><page sequence="17">102 RES 42 AUTUMN 2002 "earth monster" mouths on the band encircling the base and by the large solar rays on the upper surface, focusing on the sacrificial container at the center. Tizoc then apparently planned for his great sacrificial stone to be used in two major ceremonies. The year 8 Acatl was an extremely important ceremonial year as a whole, and several lines of evidence indicate that we should not read the vignettes under its sign in Codex Telleriano-Remensis as a unified scene. Rather they mark different moments in the year. To reconstruct the sequence of events, we must understand how Tizoc originally conceived of his temple building. His predecessors had chosen dates of events that could be interpreted according to solar metaphors to commemorate with their temple enlargements? calendar cycle beginnings, initiations of reigns, and victories (Umberger 1987). Knowing the names of the years that lay before him, Tizoc chose to begin his enlargement in 4 Acatl because it was the anniversary of the initiation of the Triple Alliance fifty-two years earlier in 1431-1432, after the victory over the Tepanecs. This was the alliance that eventually resulted in the empire, which was to be celebrated in the final ceremony.13 However, we know from many sources that the dedication ceremonies were scheduled for the next Acatl year, four years after 4 Acatl. Tizoc must have planned this too. Since such a large structure could not be completed within the year, he chose 8 Acatl because its feast days followed the same sequence as those of 4 Acatl. In addition, 8 Acatl featured a better configuration of overlapping veintenas and trecenas leading to a strong climax at the year's end. Finally, Tizoc knew that the location of the day 4 Acatl in the middle of 8 Acatl established a close link between the two years. This then would have been an acceptable type of postponement, just as rituals were routinely delayed until propitious days. Most scholars writing on the 8 Acatl scene in Telleriano-Remensis imply a single ceremony incorporating all the acts of temple dedication pictured, seemingly because of the survival of only one commemorative plaque from the time. This monument, dubbed the Dedication Stone (fig. 10), bears a large 8 Acatl date in a cartouche frame?the name of the year? below the named representations of the two kings who built the temple. Carved like the Tizoc Stone and the Coyolxauhqui Head from a dense polished stone and in a similar style, it forms with them a plausible set of contemporary monuments for the same temple phase. Like the other two, the Dedication Stone was not attached to any archaeological phase, and its exact original location remains unknown. In other words, it obviously pertained to the events of the year 8 Acatl, 1487-1488, but there is no evidence that it commemorated the great public sacrifice, nor evidence of an original location at the Templo Mayor. As seen in the description of the ceremony above, the political activities of 7 Tochtli and 8 Acatl are detailed most fully in Duran and Alvarado Tezozomoc's histories (Duran 1994:chs. 41-44; Alvarado Tezozomoc 1980: chs. 66-70). After Tizoc died and Ahuitzotl was elected as his successor, the new king's coronation war was waged against the province of Chiapa. The whole Aztec world, including enemies, was invited to the public ceremony on 1 Cipactli, but many invitees declined. The ceremony included a feast and dancing for four days, followed by the sacrifice of prisoners on the "stone of the sun"; the sacrifices wore priestly garments. The invited lords left the city, having received extravagant gifts. Ahuitzotl then led the army against the Huastecs and other provinces in the eastern part of the empire. Back in Tenochtitlan the prisoners were made to eat earth in front of Huitzilopochtli's image, were paraded around the temple precinct, and distributed among the barrios of the city. Ahuitzotl ordered artisans to complete the temple and its sculptures, including "a sharp sacrificial stone" and the image of Coyolxauhqui next to it. Invitations to the dedication ceremony were sent to the whole Aztec world, including the enemies who had refused to come to Ahuitzotl's coronation. They accepted this time. All visitors brought sacrificial victims, who were lined up along the causeways and counted. Ahuitzotl, sitting on his throne and flanked by the two allied kings, distributed tribute to the priests to pay for the upcoming ceremonies and to the artisans to make presents for the visiting lords. Ahuitzotl ordered all the city's temples to be newly plastered, painted, and decorated. The day before the festival, people from all over came into the city in great crowds. At midnight of the feast day the prisoners were (again) lined up on the four causeways and moved to the center where they were sacrificed by the three kings and Tlacaelel, helped by priests wearing the garments of all the gods and goddesses. The four primary sacrificers, in contrast, were dressed in the Toltec-derived finery of rulers?the turquoise crowns, turquoise-decorated capes, plus fine loincloths and sandals that related them to the day sun 13. Archaeology reveals that this event, the rising of the Aztecs' political "sun," had been commemorated in its own time with the inscription of 4 Acatl on a plaque attached to Phase III of the temple (Matos 1981:50; Umberger 1987).</page><page sequence="18">Umberger: Notions of Aztec history 103 (as seen in fig. 1 and described in Alvarado Tezozomoc 1980:506-509). Ahuitzotl stood next to a sacrificial stone called the tecatl, in front of the idol of Huitzilopochtli, so that he could smear blood on the god's mouth.14 The prime minister was at the "stone of the sun," one would suppose the Tizoc Stone, but whether this was on the temple platform or on its own platform in front of the temple is unclear. The other Triple Alliance kings were located at the sacrificial stones of the Yopi Temple and the Huitznahuac Temple (ibid.:515-516). The sacrificial ceremony lasted four days, and on the fifth day Ahuitzotl gave gifts to the visiting kings, who then left. Festivities and diversions continued, and the king distributed gifts to the soldiers, majordomos, officials, and priests, as well as the aged and poor of the city. The old skull rack was destroyed, the skulls burned, and a new one was erected for the skulls of those sacrificed in the temple dedication. The king gave gifts to all the artisans involved. The ceremonial period of the temple dedication completed, Ahuitzotl moved on to the next war. Obviously rolled into the events originally anticipated by Tizoc were the activities of the new king who replaced him midway through the temple expansion. In Codex Telleriano-Remensis, Ahuitzotl is depicted on his throne at the time of his accession and in the next year. This second throne scene emphasizes the temple dedication as the last in a longer-than-usual sequence of coronation ceremonies, something that is reiterated by Alvarado Tezozomoc (ibid.:486, 488-490, 492). Apparently, Ahuitzotl took offense on being snubbed by a significant number of foreign invitees to his original public accession event, and conceived the new temple dedication as an opportunity to demonstrate his power before them (Townsend 1979:40; Klein 1987:323). Since captives from all provinces were sacrificed then and since only those taken by Ahuitzotl are pictured in Telleriano-Remensis, these vignettes were meant likewise to emphasize his participation. Tizoc had died prematurely under mysterious circumstances. Duran says that members of the Aztec court poisoned him; Torquemada (1969:1:184-185) says that foreign lords had him killed through sorcery; and Ahuitzotl himself is named as a suspect in modern literature (Hassig 1988:198-199). Whatever the original circumstances and the accuracy of recorded interpretations, Ahuitzotl's commissioning of the image of the defunct ruler on the Dedication Stone indicates that he conceived the temple expansion as a joint project. Obviously, some changes were demanded after Tizoc's death, but Ahuitzotl seems to have followed as much as possible the earlier king's original program. The rebuilding of the sacred mountain, after all, was in imitation of an established royal activity, not merely Tizoc's whim (Umberger 1987). Reconstruction of the ceremonial calendar of 8 Acatl, 1487-1488 Duran and Alvarado Tezozomoc give the general sequence, but the Telleriano-Remensis vignette, monumental imagery, dates in alphabetical sources, and moveable feast day associations provide the additional evidence needed to reconstruct the day-by-day sequence and symbolic structures behind it (see fig. 5, where black triangles point to important ceremonial days). According to Chimalpahin (1965:220), on the day 1 Miquiztli Ahuitzotl completed his war against Xiuhcoac, where he acquired one of the labeled prisoners in the Telleriano-Remensis picture of the temple inauguration. One Miquiztli was the beginning day of Trecena 6, in this year falling within the veintena that ended with the first occurrence of the year-bearer 8 Acatl. Both day-names recurred 260 days later during the highlighted month of the year, when the prisoners were sacrificed at the Great Temple. So the warfare event must have occurred in the earlier veintena, given the time needed to finish the conquest and return with the prisoners to Tenochtitlan. The names of the complementary, year-bearer months, when conquest and sacrificial events occurred, "great vigil" and "stretching/ shrinking," may refer, respectively, to the anticipation of the final ceremony and its realization as the year drew to a close. Chimalpahin (ibid.:220) also mentions a ceremony on the day 4 Acatl, the feast day of Veintena IX in the middle of the year. 4 Acatl, as a moveable feast day, was the occasion of other public ceremonies of ruler 14. Alvarado Tezozomoc (1980:515) describes the tecatl as a carved figure with twisted head, while Duran (1994:328) describes it as a sharp pointed stone next to the Coyolxauhqui image. I believe that Alvarado Tezozomoc's text is confused, conflating this sacrificial stone with another sculptural type, the chacmool (a reclining figure), which could well have been on the platform too, but not in front of Huitzilopochtli's temple. The only platform that has survived at the Templo Mayor excavations?Phase II of about 1390-1430?has a chacmool in front of Tlaloc's shrine, while a plain upright stone, presumably the tecatl, stands in front of Huitzilopochtli's shrine. It seems more logical then to suppose that the tecatl was a plain stone in front of Huitzilopochtli's temple and that the Coyolxauhqui head was nearby.</page><page sequence="19">104 RES 42 AUTUMN 2002 installation, besides those on 1 Cipactli, and it was devoted to the fire god Xiuhtecuhtli (Sahag?n 1950 1982:bks. 4-5:88; Umberger 1981a:95-96). Chimalpahin, in fact, says that the ceremony was devoted to fire. In the year 8 Acatl, this day's rituals must have commemorated multiple additional events: the initiation of the pyramid expansion in the year 4 Acatl four years earlier and the foundation of the Triple Alliance in the year 4 Acatl, fifty-two years before that, as well as Ahuitzotl's installation ceremony on a day 4 Acatl in the previous year. As noted above, the day 4 Acatl, being at the center of the year 8 Acatl, linked the two years bracketing the temple construction. The cleaning and refurbishing of the city's temples before the year's intensive ceremonial season, an act that Duran mentions, would have occurred in Ochpaniztli. Two veintenas later 1 Tochtli commemorated the initiation of the Fifth Era and began the 130-day period that encompassed the events of history leading up to the triumph of the Aztecs, as well as the current events of ruler accession and final temple dedication. In the following veintena, a new Trecena Cycle began with 1 Cipactli, the date synonymous with calendrical beginnings and ruler coronations. This particular 1 Cipactli was the anniversary of Ahuitzotl's coronation in the previous year, and this aspect must have been emphasized, given Ahuitzotl's conception of the temple dedication ceremonies as connected to his accession. Thirteen days later was the anniversary of the appearance of the Fifth Era's sun on 13 Acatl, the feast day of Veintena XIV, at the end of primordial darkness. Four days after that, 4 Ollin in the next veintena, the anniversary of the sun's movement, would have featured the sacrifice of the messenger to the sun at noon on one of the city's sacrificial stones. The feast day of the same month, 7 Acatl, initiated the twenty-day period dedicated to Quetzalcoatl. This period occupied the following veintena and ended with 1 Acatl, another of Quetzalcoatl's dates. The association of Quetzalcoatl with this twenty-day period is affirmed in the imagery of the Dedication Stone. The Dedication Stone is unique among Aztec monuments in its depiction of royal succession. On it, the dead Tizoc and the living Ahuitzotl, both wearing Quetzalcoatl's priestly garb, stand below a small, unframed 7 Acatl glyph, the day that began the period, and draw blood from their ears. The streams that issue flow into the mouth of the animated earth band, which, in turn, is above the large framed 8 Acatl glyph. Several scholars have suggested that the monument thus commemorated a royal bloodletting ceremony on the day 7 Acatl in the year 8 Acatl. In this activity and the royal costumes, Ahuitzotl (who performed it alone, since Tizoc was dead) mimicked the example of Quetzalcoatl, who in Aztec lore was the first royal bloodletter (Townsend 1979; Nicholson and Qui?ones 1983:54; Klein 1987; and Qui?ones 1979).15 I agree with this interpretation of the Dedication Stone, but I disagree with the corollary idea put forth by these scholars?that the sacrifice of prisoners at the new Templo Mayor took place on the same day (see also Caso 1967:59; Tena 1987:87). Rather, the sacrifice of prisoners, as the ceremonial climax of the ritual year, had to have been scheduled on the second year-bearing day, 8 Acatl, forty days later. In addition to being the year's primary feast day, 8 Acatl was at the end of the veintena that contained the anniversary of the prisoners' capture on 1 Miquiztli in the earlier year-bearing veintena. Thus, they would have been sacrificed soon after this anniversary, linking the capture and sacrifice events together. (Of course, the scheduling of these events must be seen in reverse. Knowing that the sacrifice was to occur on the second year-bearer day, 1 Miquiztli was chosen for the capture event because of its occurrence in the year-bearer veintenas.) But why was 1 Miquiztli chosen for the capture event, instead of 8 Acatl, which would have formed a perfect symmetry? One Miquiztli was an obvious choice because of its symbolic connection with Tezcatlipoca. According to Sahag?n (1950-1982:bks. 4-5:33-36), on 1 Miquiztli, Tezcatlipoca, as lord of darkness, "went withdrawing rule and power from others." On this day, he was characterized as lord of fate and arbitrariness, who overturned the fortunes of those who did not worship him properly, making the formerly rich into slaves (slaves, in turn, being vulnerable to sacrifice). One Miquiztli then was a very appropriate day for taking sacrificial captives, especially former rulers brought low by defeat, like those represented on the Tizoc Stone (and Quetzalcoatl before them). Sahag?n's passages do not mention that Tezcatlipoca achieved this through warfare, but that is the implication. Tizoc and his priests anticipated and planned the ceremonial events of 8 Acatl, including the use of the Tizoc Stone for the sacrifice of prisoners, as maintained above. As in the case of the Dedication Stone, the imagery of this monument both supports its association 15. Quetzalcoatl was named 1 Acatl, a date that serves as his name on several sculptures. The same relative location of 7 Acatl near the heads on the Dedication Stone may indicate a calendrical name for both rulers as atavars of the king/god.</page><page sequence="20">Umberger: Notions of Aztec history 105 with the period of time and gives further information about the symbolic underpinnings of the events. The period during which the sacrifice took place began on the second 1 Miquiztli, which initiated the fifty-two-day period ruled by Tezcatlipoca, thus following the period ruled by Quetzalcoatl and ending with the ascendance of Huitzilopochtli. This, of course, was a reiteration of the sequence of these personages in history, and the period of darkness was to be conceived as a political metaphor recapitulating the cosmic events. In Aztec thought, rulership was equated to solar light and overthrown rulership to darkness; as seen above, Huitzilopochtli's political rise was thus solar. The setting of the Tizoc Stone is the earth during a time of darkness, as indicated by the starry sky band. The sun on top of the monument either has emerged from the Underworld or is still within it, but requires further blood sacrifice to begin moving through the sky. The linking of the Dedication and Tizoc Stones to ceremonial periods with different divine regents also makes sense of the divergent costumes and activities of their actors. In contrast to the Quetzalcoatl outfits of Tizoc and Ahuitzotl on the Dedication Stone, on the Tizoc Stone the ruler and the other conquering figures are all dressed asToltec-Tezcatlipoca, logically, because Tezcatlipoca, upon his ascendance, claimed (or appropriated) theToltec heritage that accompanied political dominance. The ruler Tizoc wears in addition to theToltec-Tezcatlipoca garb of his subordinates two distinctive attributes of Huitzilopochtli: the hummingbird headdress that identifies the god and a black "starry sky" painted mask (fig. 9).16 In conjunction these traits indicate that Tizoc-Huitzilopochtli, in his turn, adopted the Toltec costume of dominance as well as Tezcatlipoca's power attributes, but the "starry sky" painted mask indicates that he is still in the Underworld. Although Ahuitzotl commissioned one new monument, the Dedication Stone, for the activities of 8 Acatl, he probably used Tizoc's sacrificial stone and the Coyolxauhqui Head for their intended purposes. If Ahuitzotl had another "stone of the sun" made to replace the Tizoc Stone, it would have been comparable in most respects, given that the symbolic circumstances had been anticipated by Tizoc. Such a stone has not been found and probably never existed; there is no mention of the manufacture of a new sacrificial stone in Tenochtitlan until the late 1490s. The great "stone of the sun," presumably the Tizoc Stone, was actually used by Ahuitzotl's prime minister, while the king himself stood next to the tecatl and the image of Huitzilopochtli in the temple. So the fact that the monument bore his predecessor's name was unimportant. It would have been considered like the sacrificial stones of earlier kings, which, although moved to less prominent positions in the city on the creation of others after their deaths, were still used, not buried (Umberger 1998). Six days after 8 Acatl, another sacrificial ceremony was staged on 1 Quiahuitl this time to increase Ahuitzotl's tonalli, his solar-derived strength, through blood offerings, making obvious the ruler's comparability to the sun. (Sahag?n's mention of this ceremony attributes it to the last Aztec ruler, but it was probably practiced by his predecessors as well.) The last feast day of the year 8 Acatl fell on the day 2 Acatl at the end of Veintena XVIII. Two Acatl was the traditional date of the lighting of a "new fire" and the anniversary of Tezcatlipoca's primordial fire-lighting event. In the ceremonial calendar, on this day the god became the fire lighter as well as an Underworld warrior. A "new fire" was necessary to the initiation of all buildings (Sahag?n 1950-1982:bks. 4-5:194), and this action at the finished Templo Mayor is indicated by the fire symbol in Telleriano-Remensis. The fifty-two-day period of darkness that had begun on 1 Miquiztli finally ended on 1 Tecpatl, the day celebrating Huitzilopochtli's transcendence and solar rise. This day actually fell on the feast day of the first veintena of the following year, and no doubt it was the time of a significant ceremony with Huitzilopochtli climbing the pyramid in a solar guise without the "starry sky" mask. The ending of the entire ritual period on a day that was simultaneously a moveable feast day and a veintena feast day, was, of course, purposeful and emphasized the day's significance. Likewise, the straddling of the two years by the fifty-two-day period was ideal (see note 9). Unfortunately, no monuments remain picturing the ruler's costume on the occasions celebrated on 1 Quiahuitl, 2 Acatl, and 1 Tecpatl, to tell us more about how it was altered for these ceremonies. Presumably, his identity with Huitzilopochtli was maintained, as on the Tizoc Stone. I cannot at this time outline more exactly how the activities of the final Trecena Cycle of the year 8 Acatl were incorporated into the symbolic structures of the Veintena Cycle. I will merely reiterate that the general progression of the two cycles was probably structurally similar in some respects and that their climaxes were 16. In the Primeros Memoriales, folio 261 r, the same face paint is described in N?huatl, "mixcitlalhviticac, moteneva tlayoall]" (Sahag?n 1997:95). Thelma Sullivan translates the passage as: "His face is painted with the star design called darkness."</page><page sequence="21">106 RES 42 AUTUMN 2002 doser to achieving parallelism in 8 Acatl than in 4 Acatl. The complex of ceremonies that resulted can be reconstructed only in outline; the details were, of necessity, a pragmatic creation of the priests who tried to account for as many factors as they could in choreographing them. Only additional visual and alphabetical source materials can fill in these details. Final thoughts The above analysis should demonstrate how essential monuments and pictorial manuscripts were to the historical process as events unfolded, and how, in turn, their evidence can be used to supplement the alphabetical sources in recreating the events. The Codex Telleriano-Remensis gives a general narrative sequence and reveals, as no other source does, how the events surrounding the temple building followed a mythic prototype. The Tizoc Stone, the Coyolxauhqui Head, and the Dedication Stone were all centerpieces of specific symbolic periods during these years. These monuments commemorated both past and present events and pictured their allegorical underpinnings. Thus, in addition to the information of their hieroglyphs, they yield data crucial to the reconstruction of the mental structures behind Aztec history. The Tizoc Stone's imagery and form reveal Tizoc's intention for its use in two ceremonies, while the Dedication Stone embodies Ahuitzotl's acknowledgment of his predecessor and his own need to be recognized as the successor to the throne. Both monuments also picture the changing roles and deity costumes of historical actors during the ritual sequence. Despite their value in these respects, the monuments do not picture the ideational or narrative links between motifs, and the same caution must be exercised in using them as in using all other evidences, whether colonial or preconquest, Spanish or native, pictorial or alphabetical. While all colonial sources are the result of layers of pre- and postconquest restructuring, all visual sources have empty "spaces" between emblems that are susceptible to the invented narratives of their interpreters. We all rely on the colonial literature to fill these spaces. REFERENCES Adorno, Rolena 1986 Guarnan Poma: Writing and Resistance in Colonial Peru. University of Texas Press, Austin.
