Legare The University of Texas at Austin Jonathan D. Lane University of Michigan E. Margaret Evans University of Michigan Despite the ubiquitous use of anthropomorphic language to describe biological  change in both educational settings and popular science, little is known about  how anthropomorphic language influences children’s understanding of evolution- ary concepts. In an experimental study, we assessed whether the language used  to convey evolutionary concepts influences children’s (5- to 12-year-olds; N = 88)  understanding of evolutionary change. Language was manipulated by using three  types of narrative, each describing animals’ biological change: (a) need-based  narratives, which referenced animals’ basic survival needs; (b) desire-based or  anthropomorphic narratives, which referenced animals’ mental states; and (c) sci- entifically accurate natural selection narratives. Results indicate that the language  used to describe evolutionary change influenced children’s endorsement of and  use of evolutionary concepts when interpreting that change. Narratives using  anthropomorphic language were least likely to facilitate a scientifically accurate  interpretation. In contrast, need-based and natural selection language had similar  and positive effects, which suggests that need-based reasoning might provide a  conceptual scaffold to an evolutionary explanation of biological origins. In sum, the  language used to teach evolutionary change impacts conceptual understanding in  children and has important pedagogical implications for science education. Cristine H.

Darwin himself struggled with anthropo- morphic language, which reflected a culture in which the language bar- rier between scientists and nonscientists was porous, with terms such as  design and creation denoting God’s hand in the natural world (Beer, 2000;  O’Hara, 1992; Shapin, 1996). Biologists today continue to use concepts  such as design, albeit in a highly specialized, nonpurposeful manner. The  use of compelling but biologically imprecise language to describe evolu- tionary change has been criticized, with some arguing that such language  contributes to the widespread misunderstanding of evolutionary theory and  may reinforce misconceptions based on intuitive teleological and essential- ist biases (e.g., Jungwirth, 1975; Sprinkle, 2006). Challenges associated with teaching Darwin’s theory of evolution in  U.S. schools are not rooted exclusively in substantial popular resistance  to scientific ideas on religious or other ideological grounds (Bloom &amp;  Skolnick Weisberg, 2007; Brem, Ranney, &amp; Schindel, 2003; Evans, 2000;  Lombrozo, Shtulman, &amp; Weisberg, 2006; Scott, 2004). Growing evidence  from cognitive developmental science indicates that a variety of conceptual  biases (Evans, 2000; Evans &amp; Lane, 2011; Shtulman, 2006; Sinatra, Brem,  &amp; Evans, 2008) pose substantial obstacles to an accurate understanding  of biological change. Among these are the essentialist tendency to view  species as unchanging (Evans, 2000; Gelman, 2003; Herrmann, French,  DeHart, &amp; Rosengren, 2013; Mayr, 1982), the teleological tendency to  explain all kinds of natural phenomena by reference to purpose (Evans,  2001; Keil, 1989; Kelemen, 1999), and the anthropomorphic tendency to  attribute characteristics, such as humanlike mental states, to nonhuman  agents or events (Evans, 2008; Waytz, Epley, &amp; Cacioppo, 2010). The use of anthropomorphic language to describe biological change is  pervasive in educational settings (Evans, Spiegel, Gram, &amp; D iamond, 2009)  and in popular science media (Judson, 2009). For example, in a  Scientific  American article on the evolution of cancer, science writer Carl Zimmer  (2007) described cancer cells that “trick the body into supplying them with  energy to grow even larger” (p. 69). This description elicits the idea that  cancer cells, like humans, are capable of consciously carrying out a duplic- itous act. Such metaphorical language engages an audience, but what effect  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   169 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> 170 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly does it have on their scientific understanding? Does the novice reader grasp  the metaphor? When the language used to describe evolution both mirrors  our everyday understanding of intentional action (Kelemen &amp; R osset, 2009;  Malle &amp; Knobe, 1997; Mull &amp; Evans, 2010; Rosset, 2008) and reflects the  cross-domain mappings we use to conceptualize one domain in terms of  another (Lakoff, 1993), does it reinforce the use of intentional reasoning  or scaffold (Carey, 2000) a deeper understanding of evolution? Answering  this question has widespread implications for formal and informal learn- ing experiences in which language, either spoken or written, provides an  important interpretive bridge between the science to be learned and the  learner. One possibility is that language referring to biological organisms’  desire for change may help learners understand core scientific concepts  by providing a readily grasped metaphor that reflects intuitive anthropo- morphic semantics that are familiar to both children and adults. Alterna- tively, such language may reinforce misconceptions and leave learners with  an inaccurate understanding that biological change is indeed intentional.  This is a particular problem for evolutionary change, which is not under an  organism’s conscious control, because it is often conceptualized in anthro- pomorphic terms (Evans, 2000, 2001, 2008). In the current study, we investigated whether language that draws  on intuitive conceptual biases, in particular anthropomorphic language   implying that an animal’s intentions and desires are the impetus for change,  contributes to the maintenance of these biases in children’s explanations  for evolutionary change. Our objective was to examine the effects of  such  language on a novice population—namely, elementary school chil- dren. Children in this age range are fine-tuning their early-developing  understanding of human intentionality (Moses, Baldwin, &amp; Malle, 2001;  Mull &amp; Evans, 2010) at the same time as they are being introduced to  basic scientific concepts in formal and informal learning contexts. For this  reason, they may be especially susceptible to the influence of anthropo- morphic explanations. To address this issue, it is necessary to parse the conceptual frame- work that underlies the interpretation of intentional action. In a folk theory  of intentionality, a purposeful act invokes a complex network of beliefs,  desires, and skills that is focused on a goal that might or might not be  achieved (Malle &amp; Knobe, 1997; Wellman, 2011). Goal-directed  reasoning  is a broader category that includes a family of teleological concepts that  imply a progression toward an end point (see Mayr, 1982, pp. 47–51).  Many actions—from the beating heart to flowing neurotransmitters— appear to be goal-directed in the limited sense that they are functional yet  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   170 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="4"> Anthropomorphizing Evolution 171 occur independently of the organism’s conscious intent. These actions  reflect an internal state, or “intrinsic purpose” (Keil, 1994) that must be  satisfied if the organism is to survive. Such purposes can be described  by using anthropomorphic, desire-based language that refers to animals’  mental states such as their desires or wants, or with need-based language  that refers to animals’ nonmentalistic, biological needs. Importantly, need- based explanations that exclude mentalistic language are closer to a scien- tifically accurate notion of biological change. Adults use both forms of reasoning. In a study of natural history  museum visitors’ concepts of evolution, for example, some adult visitors  used desire-based reasoning to describe changes in the size and shape of the  Galapagos’ finches’ beaks: “They had to try and work harder, probably, to  develop their beaks” (Evans et al., 2010). However, the majority of visitors  used need-based reasoning with no reference to conscious intent or desires  on the part of the organism: “Well, in order to survive, their body parts had  to adjust to certain things, similar to the way giraffes’ necks probably grew  long as they reached for the plants at the top of the trees, so the beak grew  longer in order to deal with the tougher seeds.” Moreover, the ability to  distinguish between need- and desire-based language seemed to be pivotal  in visitors’ emerging grasp of evolutionary concepts (Diamond &amp; Evans,  2007; Evans et al., 2009, 2010; Spiegel et al., 2012). There is evidence that the ability to make this distinction between  need and desire is linked to an improved understanding of evolutionary  change. Adult and youth visitors to an evolution exhibition increased their  use of both need-based reasoning and evolutionary reasoning (i.e., refer- ring to basic evolutionary concepts of variation, inheritance, selection,  time, and adaptation) but decreased their desire-based reasoning (Spiegel  et al., 2012).  Furthermore, visitors’ need-based reasoning (e.g., “The first  fruit flies needed to change into different kinds in order to live on the dif- ferent Hawaiian islands”), but not their desire-based reasoning, was posi- tively correlated with their endorsement of evolutionary themes. This effect  was, however, less pronounced for the youngest visitors (11- to 13-year- olds), who were also the group most likely to endorse desire-based   explanations (Spiegel et al., 2012). On the other hand, need-based   reasoning was n egatively correlated with intentional design  reasoning in  which an  anonymous creator designs organisms for a particular purpose  (e.g., “S pecial fruit flies were created to live on Hawaii”), whereas desire- based r easoning (e.g., “The first fruit flies wanted to change ...”), was  positively correlated with i ntentional design. Overall, the youngest visi- tors and those visitors who rejected the idea of evolutionary origins for  religious reasons were the groups most likely to endorse intentional-design  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   171 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> 172 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly arguments, albeit at relatively low levels—results that are consistent with  previous studies (Evans, 2000, 2001). This pattern of results suggests that these two intuitive conceptual  biases—desire-based and need-based reasoning—may be distinct and  embedded in different knowledge structures at a certain point in develop- ment: the former a component of an intuitive psychology, with a focus on  mental states, and the latter a component of an intuitive biology, with a focus  on internal, nonmentalistic states, those necessary for survival. Both, how- ever, are directed toward goals. As explanations for evolutionary change,  both reasoning patterns are pervasive, found in students spanning the educa- tional spectrum from elementary school to college (Alters &amp;  Nelson, 2002;  Evans, 2008), as well as among natural history museum visitors (Evans  et al., 2010; Macfadden et al., 2007). Although young elementary school  children can make the distinction between need and desire, reasoning that  animals breathe because they need to not because they want to (Poling  &amp; Evans, 2002), they are more likely than older e lementary school chil- dren to default to mental-state language to describe evolutionary change  (Evans, 2000, 2008). To investigate this phenomenon in more detail, we  use the term anthropomorphic in a narrow sense to refer to mentalistic  or  desire-based concepts, and the term need-based to  reference internal,  nonmentalistic states. The use of multiple explanatory frameworks to interpret evolution- ary change is pervasive (Evans, 2001; Evans, Legare, &amp; Rosengren, 2011;  Legare, Evans, Rosengren, &amp; Harris, 2012). Evans et al. (2010) demon- strated that 72% of highly educated U.S. visitors to natural history museums  used a mixture of intuitive reasoning (e.g., need- or desired-based reason- ing) and less-intuitive evolutionary reasoning. A further 28% used creation- ist reasoning, as well (Evans et al., 2010), which was less than the 45%  of the U.S. general public who endorsed creationist views  (Gallup, 2007).  These findings demonstrate that some conceptual biases apparent in early  childhood (e.g., a tendency to conceive of biological change as intentional)  persist in adult populations, even highly educated populations interested in  natural history (Evans et al., 2010). Given persistent misconceptions about evolutionary concepts, what  might be the best way to convey an understanding of evolutionary change?  There is abundant evidence that narrative can be used as an effective peda- gogical tool (e.g., Bruner, 1996). In the case of evolution, narrative in an  easily accessible causal framework can unite disparate biological and envi- ronmental events occurring over the eons. Moreover, previous research in  museum settings indicates that narrative can be used successfully to convey  information about natural selection to elementary school children, though  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   172 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="6"> Anthropomorphizing Evolution 173 it may be more successful with older children (Legare, Hazel, French, Witt,  &amp; Evans, 2007; see also Abbott, 2003; Kelemen, Seston, &amp; Ganea, 2009;  Metz, Sisk-Hilton, Berson, &amp; Ly, 2010). In the current study, narrative was used as a pedagogical device to  assess whether the language used to convey ideas about evolution influ- ences the extent to which children both endorse and express different kinds  of explanations for evolutionary change. We experimentally manipulated  the language to describe evolutionary change with three types of narrative  by using (a) need-based explanations, referencing basic survival needs; (b)  desire-based or anthropomorphic explanations, referencing mental states;  and (c) scientifically accurate natural selection explanations. In a within- subjects design, children were asked about their understanding of evolu- tionary change in three populations of birds by using the three different  narratives. Apart from the verb forms, the narratives for each story were  identical; for example, the basic concepts of natural selection—differential  survival and reproduction—were embedded in each narrative even though  the verbs used to convey this information differed by condition. Dependent measures included the language children used when asked  to retell the stories and children’s responses to closed-ended questions about  the narratives. Our focus was on children’s expression of and endorsement  of need-based, desire-based, and natural selection explanations. Addition- ally, we were interested in whether children differed in their endorsement  of intentional-design and evolution explanations. Endorsement of the term  evolution would indicate that children had been exposed to information  about evolution, although children in these age groups have not yet taken  formal courses on the topic. The intentional-design explanation focused  on the action (i.e., to make), not the designer. This wording had been suc- cessfully used in earlier studies (Evans, 2008; Spiegel et al., 2012), and it  ensured that children were not just responding to the term God reflexively  while ignoring the significance of the underlying action (Evans, 2001). Our central hypothesis was that the language of the narrative would  influence children’s expression of evolutionary concepts, with anthro- pomorphic language being the most likely to reinforce intuitive anthro- pomorphic misconceptions and detract from an accurate conceptual  understanding of evolution, particularly of natural selection. Based on  prior research with adults and children, more specific predictions were  that (a) the desire-based narrative would have the strongest influence on  children’s use of anthropomorphic language in their retelling of the story  and in their endorsement of desire-based explanations for the closed-ended  questions; (b) the effect of condition would also hold for the language used  in children’s retelling of the need-based and natural selection narratives;  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   173 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> 174 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly (c) younger children (5–7 years) would be more likely both to express and  to endorse a nthropomorphic language and intentional-design concepts  across conditions; conversely, older children (8–12 years) would be more  likely to express and endorse natural selection explanations and evolution- ary language across conditions; and (d) children in both age groups would  endorse more than one of these kinds of explanations simultaneously. Method Participants Ninety-eight 5- to 12-year-olds were interviewed at a Midwest university- affiliated natural history museum in two individual interview sessions.   Children were recruited through a science summer camp administered by  the museum—a half-day program consisting of mixed-age 2-week-long  sessions. These programs expanded students’ knowledge of science through  experimental and instructional activities. Topics included astronomy, aero- space, wildlife, ecology, geology, and paleontology. Ten children did not  complete the interview. The final sample included 88 children (45 boys),  from 5.83 to 12.47 years of age (M = 8.51 years, SD = 1.64). To examine  age-related differences, the sample was divided into two age groups: young  (5.5–7.9 years, n = 34) and old (8.0–12.4 years, n = 54). Participants were  75% European American, 16% Asian American, 3% African American,  3% Latin American, 2% unspecified. Design and Procedure Children’s understanding of evolutionary change was assessed with a struc- tured interview that included open-ended (i.e., story recall) and closed- ended questions. They were interviewed individually in a quiet area of the  museum. Experimenters read children three narratives (with accompany- ing pictures) on evolutionary change, each on a different bird population  (brownbirds, Haast eagles, and kiwis); the birds were presented in a fixed  order. For each bird population, there were three narrative types, each of  which used different language to describe population change:  natural selec- tion, need-based, and desire-based (anthropomorphic) narratives. C hildren  were presented with the three narrative types in a random order with the  constraint that for each age group there were an equal number of the three  narrative types (natural selection, need-based, desire-based) in the first,  second, or third positions. In both closed- and open-ended responses,  we assessed whether children differentiated between natural selection  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   174 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="8"> Anthropomorphizing Evolution 175 language, desire-based (anthropomorphic) language, and need-based   language. Following each story, children were asked to retell the story and  were then asked how much they endorsed different explanations for change  in bird population. See Appendices A–C for the narratives about the brown- bird, the Haast eagles, and the kiwis, respectively. Each of the narratives  was accompanied by photographs or drawings of the birds and their envi- ronments, and the language of the stories was equated for reading level.  All of these narratives were based on changes that have actually occurred  in these bird populations, but the name brownbird was used instead of the  finch in case children were familiar with the latter bird. Measures Narrative recall. Following each of these narratives, children were told,  “Tell the story back to me just the way that I told it to you. Try to remember  as many details as possible.” Following children’s initial response, children  were asked, “Can you tell me a bit more about the story?” Their responses  were then coded for different kinds of language use, described next. Coding and Scoring Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. A coding rubric was  developed based on extensive review of the transcripts. Coding captured  information about story details, evolutionary concepts, the kind of argu- ment used to describe biological change, and desire-based, need-based,  and evolution language. All coding was completed by a research assistant  unaware of the study hypotheses. To establish interrater reliability, 20% of  the interviews were also coded by the second author (percent agreement ≥  80% for all coding categories). Children’s recall was coded for story details, which included men- tioning the specific bird (e.g., brownbird, Haast eagle, kiwi), location  (e.g.,  Galapagos Islands, New Zealand), characteristics of descendants (e.g.,  cannot fly, small wings, big feet), and characteristics of ancestors (e.g., could  fly, had larger wings, had smaller feet). For each of the three narratives,  children who referred to the bird species earned a score of 1. For location,  children received a score of 1 for each narrative if they mentioned the loca- tion of the birds. For ancestor and descendant facts, a score ranging from 0  (no details) to 3 (many details) was earned for each narrative. Story recall was also coded for information about five basic evolutionary  concepts: variation, inheritance, selection, time, and adaptation (VISTA) (see  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   175 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="9"> 176 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly Evans et al., 2010). Variation was coded for information about  within-species  variation (members of a species vary; e.g., “some have smaller beaks and  some have bigger beaks”) and between-species variation (comparing and  contrasting differences between modern birds and their ancestors; e.g., “the  brownbirds had thicker beaks than their ancestors”). Inheritance was coded  for information that traits (genes) are inherited and passed from one genera- tion to the next (e.g., “they had chicks and some of them had heavier beaks  also”). Adaptation was coded for information about the link between the  beak size and food, the link between climate change and the food source, or  the link between body size and food source, which differed depending on the  bird (e.g., “the climate changed so their beaks got wider over evolutionary  time”). Additionally, we coded for the type of adaptation argument that the  children made: desire-based change (e.g., “some birds wanted to change so  they could eat those seeds”); need-based change (e.g., “some birds needed to  change so they could eat different seeds); and the two components of a natu- ral selection argument: differential survival (e.g., “there was a drought and  for many years it got dry and the birds with bigger beaks survived better  because there were only bigger seeds that were harder to crack open”) and  differential reproduction (e.g., “these birds breed more than the ones with  small beaks and so some of their children had big beaks so they grew”).  Information about time was also coded (i.e., many years ago, millions of  years, billions, over evolutionary time, a long time ago, after a while, as time  went by, old times). For each of these concepts, children received a 1 if the  concept was recalled from a story, and a 0 if that concept was not recalled  from a story, for a total of 0–3 across the three stories. The specific language children used to recall the narratives was also  coded. Language was coded as anthropomorphic if it included any of the  following phrases indicating that the animal was making a conscious effort  or choice: tried to, like to, want to, decided to, or thought (e.g., “they tried to  have bigger beaks,” “they liked eating small seeds,” “some birds wanted to  change so they could eat those seeds”). Need-based language included the  following: need to, had to, so that, so they could, in order that, or adapted  to (e.g., “some of them needed to be bigger,” “some of the birds changed  after a while so they could eat”). Evolution language included the follow- ing terms: variation, adaptation, selection, and evolution (e.g., “over time the  birds evolved,” “the change in the climate determined a change in the food  source which in turn made the birds adapt”). Children’s language was coded  for up to five different forms of need-based language (for  a  score of 0–5  for each of the three narratives), up to five different forms of desire-based  (anthropomorphic) language (for a score of 0–5 for each narrative), and up to  four different evolution terms (for a score of 0–4 for each narrative). MPQ 59.2_03.indd   176 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="10"> Anthropomorphizing Evolution 177 Endorsement of explanations for change. Following children’s recall  of each randomly ordered story, children were also asked how much they  agreed or disagreed that the population change was a result of (a) inten- tional design, (b) desire for change, (c) need for change, (d) natural selec- tion (which included both components, differential survival and differential  reproduction), and (e) evolution, randomly ordered. Children rated their  agreement with each of these five explanations for each of the three birds  by using the following scale: 1 = “Disagree a lot,” 2 = “Disagree a little,”  3 = “Don’t know,” 4 = “Agree a little,” and 5 = “Agree a lot.” At the begin- ning of the procedure, children were trained to use the agree-disagree scale,  with expressive faces reflecting the degree of agreement. Below are the  explanations given for the brownbird narratives. (See Appendix D for ques- tions for the other two narratives.) “I am going to tell you about some ideas that other kids have had about  how birds changed. You can agree with all of their ideas, or some of their  ideas, or you can disagree with all of their ideas. It depends on what you  think. We asked kids: How did the brownbirds get to have beaks with dif- ferent sizes? Some kids said ...” 1. Special brownbirds were made that way to eat different kinds   of food. 2. The brownbird ancestors’ wanted to have different beaks because  they liked different kinds of food. 3. The brownbird ancestors’ beaks changed because they needed to  eat different kinds of food. 4. Only the brownbird ancestors with heavy beaks could eat the  tough seeds, so they lived and had more babies. 5. The different sizes of brownbird beaks are the result of evolution. Results Focal to the current investigation were the effects of age and of narrative  type on children’s explanations. Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs)  were used to assess the effects of age as a between-subjects factor (2: young,  old) and narrative type as a within-subjects factor (3: desire-based, need- based, natural selection) on children’s recall of particular language and  concepts from the narratives (see Table 1). Another set of five two-way  ANOVAs was used to assess the effects of age as a between-subjects factor  (2: young, old) and narrative type as a within-subjects factor (3: desire- based, need-based, natural selection) on children’s endorsement of each  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   177 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="11"> 178 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly MPQ 59.2_03.indd   178 14/04/13   10:40 AM Table 1.

The type of reasoning that children used for adaptive  change in their recall of the narratives, as well as the language they used,  are particularly revealing. (See Table 1 for F and p values for each two-way  ANOVA.) Post hoc analyses (adjusting for multiple comparisons by using  Bonferroni corrections) demonstrated the following: Children more often  referred to desire-based change when recalling the desire-based narrative, ps  &lt; .001; more often referred to need-based change when recalling the need- based narrative, ps &lt; .01; and more often mentioned differential reproduc- tive success, p &lt; .01, and (to a lesser extent) differential s urvival, p = .07,  when retelling the natural selection narrative (in contrast to the desire-based  narrative). Further, when presented the desire-based narrative,  children  Figure 1.

Given that the dependent variable for each explanation and evolution- ary concept was coded dichotomously (as present or absent) for each nar- rative type, we constructed a continuous dependent variable that reflected  children’s broader use of evolutionary concepts by combining the codes for  those concepts that adults may reference when asked about evolutionary  change (Evans et al., 2010), into a VISA composite (ranging from 0 to 5):  (a) variation between species, (b) variation within species, (c) inheritance,  (d) differential survival explanations, and (e) differential reproduction  explanations. (Time was rarely invoked, so it was not included in the com- posite.) Children were found to use VISA concepts more frequently when  presented with the natural selection narrative (as opposed to the desire- based narrative), p &lt; .05; there was no difference between need-based and  natural selection narratives. Closed-ended explanations. With regard to children’s ratings of dif- ferent explanations for biological change (see Figure 1), in separate two- way ANOVAs (one for each of the five explanations for change) we found  a main effect of narrative type on endorsement of the idea that birds changed  because of their desire for change, F(2, 85) = 6.80, p &lt; .01. Parallel to the  finding on children’s story recall, Tukey post-hoc comparisons indicated  that children more strongly endorsed the desire-based explanation when  they were presented the desire-based narrative (M = 3.52, SE = .14), in  contrast to the natural selection narrative (M = 2.80, SE = .16), p &lt; .01, and  need-based narrative (M = 3.09, SE = .15), p = .06. To investigate whether there was an effect of narrative on mixed rea- soning, for each of the five closed-ended explanations, children’s responses  were coded as 0 for 1–3 (strongly disagree, disagree, or don’t know) or 1  for a 4 (agree) or 5 (strongly agree). A mixed reasoning composite was  computed by summing the 0s and 1s across the five explanations (possible  range: 0-5). There was no effect of narrative type; for each of the three nar- ratives children endorsed the same number of explanations, roughly three  (desire-based: M = 2.96, SE = .11; need-based: M = 3.04, SE = .13; natural  selection: M = 2.74, SE = .12), F(2, 85) = 5.59, ns. Effects of Age Group Story recall. Next we turn to the effects of age on children’s narrative  recall. (See Table 1 for F and p values for two-way ANOVAs.) In their recall  of the narratives, older children (8- to 12-year-olds) remembered more  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   180 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="14"> Anthropomorphizing Evolution 181 details about the stories, including the location of the birds, F(1, 86) = 7.13,  p &lt; .01, and details about the bird ancestors, F(1, 86) = 6.17, p &lt; .05. Older  children more often used need-based reasoning to explain adaptive change,  and more often mentioned differential survival and differential reproduc- tive success in their recall. Older children were also more likely to mention  the evolutionary concepts of within-species variation and the inheritance  of traits and were more likely to use need-based and evolutionary terms.  Overall, older children used VISA concepts more often than did younger  children. Closed-ended explanations. There were significant main effects for  age in children’s agreement with the intentional-design explanation, the  desire-based (anthropomorphic) explanation, and the evolution e xplanation  (see Figure 1). The youngest children more strongly endorsed the idea  of intentional design, that birds were “made that way,” F(1, 86) = 9.95,  p &lt; .01, and the idea that birds change because of desire, that birds “wanted  to” change, F(1, 86) = 5.21, p &lt; .05. In contrast, the oldest children more  strongly endorsed the idea that birds changed because of evolution,  F(1, 86) = 14.03, p &lt; .001. Younger and older children equally endorsed the  idea that the birds changed because they “needed to” and because of natural  selection. Using the mixed reasoning composite, we found that younger  children (M = 2.89, SE = .14) endorsed as many of the five explanations as  did older children did (M = 2.94, SE = .11), F(1, 86) = .06, ns. Patterns of Reasoning: Multiple Explanations To determine whether there were discernible patterns in children’s endorse- ment of multiple explanations, zero-order correlations were carried out  on children’s endorsement of the five closed-ended explanations for bio- logical change, collapsed across the three stories and the two age groups.  Endorsement of desire-based explanations for change was correlated with  endorsement of intentional-design explanations, r(88) = .46, p &lt; .001;  desire-based explanations were also correlated with need-based explana- tions, r(88) = .31, p &lt; .01. Endorsement of evolution explanations was cor- related with endorsement of natural selection explanations, r(88) = .26,  p &lt; .05. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that need- and desire- based explanations are embedded in different explanatory frameworks. Examining the explanations that children offered to describe animals’  adaptation (desire-based, goal-directed, differential survival, and differ- ential reproduction reasoning), desire-based reasoning was not correlated  with any other form of reasoning. Need-based reasoning was correlated  with reasoning involving differential survival, r(88) = .34, p = .001, and  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   181 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="15"> 182 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly with reasoning involving differential reproduction, r(88) = .25, p &lt; .05.  Children who mentioned differential survival often also mentioned differ- ential reproduction, r(88) = .53, p &lt; .001. Discussion This study demonstrates that the language used to describe evolutionary  change influences children’s retelling of and endorsement of evolutionary  concepts, particularly of natural selection. Anthropomorphic language is  most likely to have a negative effect. Need-based and natural selection lan- guage, in contrast, have similar and more positive effects. Regardless of  the language of instruction, however, children in this age range are able  to grasp some core ideas about natural selection. Before considering the  implications of this research, we describe the effects of both narrative type  and age on children’s reasoning about evolutionary change, focusing on  the major explanations used in each of the three types of narrative: desire- based (anthropomorphic), need-based, and natural selection. Our data support our first prediction that the desire-based narrative  would have the strongest influence on elementary school children’s expla- nations of evolutionary change. In contrast to explanations given for the  other two narratives, desire-based explanations of adaptive change and the  use of desire-based language were much more frequent in children’s retell- ing of the desire-based narrative, regardless of age. For the endorsement  task, in contrast, there were effects of age as well as narrative type, with  younger children (5–7 years) and children who had heard the desire-based  narrative more likely to agree with desire-based explanations. Consistent with the second prediction, need-based explanations of  adaptive change and need-based language were more likely to be elicited  by the need-based narrative in children’s retelling of the story. In this case,  there were age differences in children’s recall; older children (8–12 years)  more often expressed need-based explanations and language, regardless of  narrative type. In contrast, for the endorsement task, children’s agreement  with need-based explanations did not vary by age group or by narrative  type; most children agreed with need-based explanations. For the natu- ral selection narrative, the results were somewhat similar. Children were  much more likely to express natural selection explanations of evolutionary  change when they retold the story following the natural selection narrative  and were also more likely to express evolutionary concepts, as reflected in  the overall composite score. However, there was no effect of narrative type  on their use of evolutionary terminology; children rarely spontaneously  expressed evolution terms. For the endorsement task, in contrast, children  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   182 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="16"> Anthropomorphizing Evolution 183 from both age groups were very likely to agree with the natural selection  explanations for the closed-ended questions, and there was no effect of  narrative type. Overall, children expressed significantly fewer evolutionary  concepts when they were exposed to the desire-based narrative, in com- parison with both the need-based and natural selection narratives. The third prediction, based on the results of prior research (Evans,  2000; Spiegel et al., 2012), was that younger elementary school children  would be more likely to agree with intentional design explanations, and  that, conversely, older elementary school children would be more likely to  agree with evolutionary terminology, as assessed in the endorsement task.  Our data indicate that younger children were especially likely to endorse  both types of anthropomorphic explanations: desire-based and design- based. Younger children were more likely than older children to agree that  birds were specially “made that way.” Even though these children were a  self-selected group (i.e., they had chosen to attend a natural history summer  camp), these findings are consistent with those of other research studies,  conducted in fundamentalist and nonfundamentalist Christian communi- ties, indicating that, regardless of background, early elementary school– aged children are more likely to endorse creationist explanations (Evans,  2000, 2001). One interpretation of these findings is that because of the  centrality of developing an understanding of human intentionality in this  age group, these children are more susceptible to the artifact analogy: Just  as people make artifacts, someone must have made animals. Thus this anal- ogy is easily elicited as an explanation for the creation of different kinds  of animals. Older children, on the other hand, more often agreed that evolution  explained adaptive change, suggesting that they had heard this term. How- ever, older children were no more likely than younger children to use  evolutionary terminology in their story recall and were just as likely as  younger children to default to desire-based language following the desire- based story. In sum, for the story-recall task, older children were just as  susceptible as the younger children to the effects of a narrative in which  anthropomorphic language was used to explain evolutionary change. Thus,  even though they recognized that evolution was a good explanation for  biological change, a reflective understanding of evolution might not yet be  part of their everyday account of biological change. Consistent with the results from adults and older youth in earlier  museum studies (Evans et al., 2010; Spiegel et al., 2012), we found an  increase in children’s recall of key evolutionary concepts across devel- opment. Although both age groups were sensitive to between-population   differences, the older children were significantly more likely to recall the  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   183 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="17"> 184 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly key concept of within-species variation. This finding, we argue, indicates  that the older children are less wedded to an essentialist constraint that each  kind of bird is essentially the same (Evans, 2000, 2001, 2008; Gelman,  2003; Shtulman &amp; Schulz, 2008). Furthermore, older children were more  likely to mention differential selection, the inheritance of traits, and dif- ferential reproduction, with the age effects being greatest for the latter two  concepts. These age effects are not simply a function of older children’s  better memory, because the main differences were for the type of explana- tion, not the quantity of information. Both age groups (5- to 7-year-olds and  8- to 12-year-olds) recalled similar amounts of information about the bird  descendents. This pattern of results suggests a developmental trajectory in  an understanding of natural selection, from within-species variation to dif- ferential survival to inheritance to differential reproduction. A full grasp of  natural selection requires all of these concepts. Whether they build on one  another, as this trajectory suggests, should be assessed in future studies. Like adults (Evans et al., 2010; Legare et al., 2012), children endorsed  more than one of these explanations simultaneously. On average, chil- dren agreed with three of the explanations articulated in the closed-ended   questions. Further, there was a significant, though modest, correlation  between endorsement of the evolution and natural selection explanations,  suggesting that some of the children had prior exposure to these ideas.  Endorsement of the desire-based explanation was correlated with endors- ing need-based and the intentional-design-based explanations. However,  endorsement of need-based explanations was not correlated with endorse- ment of design-based explanations. Taken together, these findings suggest  that children who endorse desire-based explanations may be more recep- tive to endorsing multiple explanations, including explanations consistent  with creationism, than are children endorsing need-based explanations. The explanations that children produced to explain biological change  were particularly revealing. Need-based reasoning (but not desire-based  reasoning) was correlated with children’s spontaneous reference to two  important components of evolution: differential survival and differential  reproduction. This pattern is consistent with the possibility that need-based  and desire-based explanations function differently in children’s intuitive  explanatory frameworks than they appear to do for adults (Evans et al., 2010;  Spiegel et al., 2012). Need-based narratives (e.g., “Change is necessary to  survive”) are central to naïve biological reasoning and may scaffold evolu- tionary reasoning. In contrast, desire-based narratives, which incorporate  anthropomorphic language (e.g., “The animal wanted to change to get the  food”) and are thus central to a naïve psychology, do not. Further evidence  for this claim comes from our finding that the need-based narrative was  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   184 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="18"> Anthropomorphizing Evolution 185 as likely as the natural selection narrative to elicit e volutionary  concepts  on the VISA (evolutionary) composite variable, whereas the desire-based  narrative elicited significantly fewer VISA concepts than either of the other  narratives. There were clear developmental differences in need-based explana- tions, with older children much more likely to express need-based and  natural selection explanations for adaptation in their story retelling. Yet, on  the closed-ended task, both the need-based and natural selection explana- tions were highly endorsed by children in both age groups, regardless of  narrative type. The desire-based explanation, in contrast, was more likely  to be endorsed by the younger children. Thus, even the youngest children  recognized that need-based and natural selection explanations were plau- sible accounts of change; even if they had difficulty expressing these con- cepts in the story-recall tasks (perhaps indicating that such explanations  had not yet been integrated into their everyday understanding of biologi- cal change). The distinction between need- and desire-based explana- tory frameworks was especially clear among the older children. As one  81⁄2-year-old explained, “You don’t evolve because you want to; you evolve  because you have to.” Thus, among older children, the ostensible goal of  evolutionary change is much clearer: Change satisfies the intrinsic needs  (not desires) of the organism (Evans, 2000, 2008; Keil, 1994). We propose that need-based reasoning may function as a transitional  explanation, a placeholder, in which an intrinsic, nonmentalistic goal, the  need for survival, may be tied to differential survival in a population (Evans  et al., 2010; Spiegel et al., 2012). The child (or adult) who has achieved  this level of reasoning is approaching an understanding of the mechanism  of evolutionary change: natural selection. However, there is a cautionary  tale, particularly for younger school-age children who are in the process of  acquiring a folk theory of intentionality (Mull &amp; Evans, 2010). Anthropo- morphic narratives elicit intentional explanations in the listener. Such meta- phorical language is engaging, yet it can also mislead, reinforcing intuitive  anthropomorphic misconceptions and hindering children’s expression of  evolutionary concepts. Implications: Both Practical and Theoretical This study lends further support to a growing body of research (Kelemen  et al., 2009; Legare et al., 2007; Metz et al., 2010) demonstrating that ele- mentary school children can successfully learn about the basic mechanism  of evolutionary change: natural selection. The willingness of older elemen- tary school children to express and endorse evolutionary explanations  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   185 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="19"> 186 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly supports the idea that narratives based on natural selection language can be  used for pedagogical purposes. This is encouraging in light of evidence that  many U.S. adults currently reject or misunderstand evolutionary explana- tions (e.g., Evans et al., 2010; Gallup, 2007). It should be noted, however,  that the sample of children participating in this study consisted of summer  campers at a natural history museum and thus were not representative of  the general population of age-matched peers in terms of their interest in  science. The sample was chosen in order to examine the extent to which  narrative style influences evolutionary reasoning in a population sympa- thetic to evolutionary concepts and interested in natural history. To our  knowledge, this is the first study to manipulate the language of instruction  explicitly and to demonstrate that the language of instruction is key to suc- cessfully conveying these ideas. Despite the fact that the children in the current study were self-selected  and more likely to have been exposed to evolutionary concepts at home or  in the museum, similar results have been found with children from more  diverse backgrounds, both in schools (Metz, et al., 2010) and in museums  (Evans &amp; Lane, 2010; Evans, Rosengren, Lane, &amp; Price, 2012). Collec- tively these studies suggest that if evolution education was a feature of the  elementary school curriculum, this might translate into a greater accep- tance of evolution in the population at large. Future research with more  heterogeneous samples would strengthen claims about the generalizability  of our findings. When developing curricular or exhibition materials, it is tempting to  engage learners by using anthropomorphic language. Thus, it is important  to demonstrate how such language influences children’s understanding of  evolution. Parents often translate the evolutionary language found in exhi- bition text into intuitive terms, such as anthropomorphic explanations, in  order to convey these ideas to their children (Tare, French, Frazier, Dia- mond, &amp; Evans, 2011). Whereas it is essential that we expose young chil- dren to the theoretical framework that unites the field of biology (Mayr,  1982), it is equally critical that we do not do so by providing an explanatory  framework, a naïve psychology, that has the potential of providing a conduit  to a compelling alternative to the theory of evolution: creationism (Evans,  2000, 2001, 2008). This is especially the case with younger children, who  are particularly susceptible to the effects of anthropomorphic language. We  suggest that need-based reasoning supplies an equally compelling narrative  that is less likely to mislead and might well provide a conceptual scaffold to  an evolutionary explanation of origins (see also Zohar &amp; Ginossar, 1998). Despite other advantages that anthropomorphism may have (Waytz  et al., 2010), we argue that a conceptual cost is associated with the tendency  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   186 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="20"> Anthropomorphizing Evolution 187 to anthropomorphize biological change. By applying human characteristics  to animals and plants, the biological world is assigned a sense of human  purpose and free will that impedes an accurate understanding of biologi- cal processes. The natural world requires neither purpose nor free will to  undergo profound change that might well ensure its survival. The tendency  of religious groups to see free will and purpose where, for the evolutionary  biologist, there is none, is at the core of the difference between evolution- ary theory and creationism (Evans, 2008). We propose that a central explanatory framework for a naïve biology  (Carey, 1985; Erickson, Keil, &amp; Lockhart, 2010; Inagaki &amp; Hatano, 2002;  Medin &amp; Atran, 2004) is the need for survival. Living things, both plants  and animals, have features that serve an organism’s intrinsic needs, its abil- ity to survive. These features were not bestowed upon the organism by a  sentient being, nor did the organism develop them through a conscious act  of free will. The idea of the need for survival is intuitive and provides a  sense of purpose lacking in a purely mechanical or contingent account of  evolutionary change. Need-based reasoning may give humans an under- standing of purpose without impeding their understanding of natural law. References Abbott, H. P. (2003).

Dif- ferent kinds of brownbirds like to have different beaks because they want  to eat different sorts of food. The medium brownbirds wanted to have  big heavy beaks so that they can eat the tough seeds of Tribulus plants  that grow on these islands. But, do you know what!? Many years ago, the  ancestors of these brownbirds had beaks that looked quite different. Sci- entists think that they wanted to have small light beaks. How could that  happen? The brownbird ancestors were probably blown to the islands by  storms. When they arrived, the islands were covered with plants with small  soft seeds. Because the brownbird ancestors had small beaks, they liked to  eat the soft seeds. But, there was a change in the weather. For many years,  there was no rain, and the plants with the soft seeds died. Only the tough  Tribulus plants lived. Most brownbirds could not live because they could  not eat the tough Tribulus seeds. But some brownbirds wanted to change to  have slightly heavier beaks so that they were able to eat the tough Tribulus  seeds. The brownbirds with heavier beaks could eat better and live longer  than the small-beaked brownbirds. They also wanted to have more chicks,  some of which had heavier beaks, too. The chicks with the heavier beaks  lived longer, and they had more chicks, as well. So, over many years, try- ing to change their beak size made a big difference. Over time, brownbirds  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   191 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="25"> 192 Merrill-Palmer Quarterly wanted to change to adapt to their surroundings. Now, many years later, the  medium brownbirds have very different beak shapes than their ancestors. Haast Eagle This is a Haast eagle. They were the biggest eagles ever. They tried to  have very strong legs, long wings, and a sharp beak. Haast eagles once  lived in New Zealand. But, do you know what!? Millions of years ago, the  ancestors of the Haast eagle looked very different. Scientists think they  looked like regular eagles. How could that happen? About 2 million years  ago, there were huge birds in New Zealand called moas. They were almost  10 feet tall. They couldn’t fly, but they were safe and didn’t want to fly,  because there were no animals big enough that liked to catch them. Then,  about a million years ago, a small flock of eagles arrived on New Zealand.  Maybe they were blown there by storms. At first, these eagles were much  smaller than the moas. But some eagles wanted to change, and they became  a little bit bigger than most of the other eagles. Because they tried to be big- ger, they began to catch bigger food, like the moas. So the eagles that had  bigger wings and bodies were able to catch and eat the moas. They were  better fed and lived longer than the smaller eagles. They also wanted to  have more chicks, some of which wanted to be bigger, too. The chicks that  were bigger were able to live longer, and they had more chicks, as well. So,  over many millions of years, these little changes in body size made a big  difference. Over time, eagles wanted to change to adapt to their surround- ings. After a million years, the Haast eagles were larger than any other kind  of eagle that ever lived on Earth. Kiwi This is a kiwi. Kiwis don’t like to fly. They have tiny wings, kind of furry  feathers, and big feet. They also have a great sense of smell, which most  birds don’t. Kiwis live in New Zealand. To get food, kiwis like to burrow in  the ground to find bugs and worms. But, do you know what!? Millions of  years ago, the ancestors of kiwis looked very different. Scientists think they  looked like regular birds. They could even fly. How could that happen? In  New Zealand, where the ancestors of the kiwis lived, the ground was safe  because there were no animals who wanted to hunt them. There were lots  of bugs and worms in the ground for them to eat. So they didn’t like to fly.  Some kiwi ancestors wanted to change so that they could have bigger feet  for digging and a better sense of smell. The kiwi ancestors with bigger feet  MPQ 59.2_03.indd   192 14/04/13   10:40 AM </page> <page sequence="26"> Anthropomorphizing Evolution 193 were better at finding food under the ground. So these kiwi ancestors ate  better and lived longer than the other kiwi ancestors. They also wanted to  have more chicks, some of which had bigger feet, too. The chicks with the  bigger feet lived longer, and they had more chicks, as well. So, over many  millions of years, these little changes in foot size made a big difference.  Over time, kiwis wanted to change to adapt to their surroundings. Now,  there are kiwis with big feet they like to use for digging, a good sense of  smell they like to use to hunt for worms, and almost no wings. They look  really different from their ancestors, who had wings. Appendix B. Need-Based Narratives Brownbird This is a medium brownbird. These brownbirds live on these islands.
