MAY FARHAT A MEDITERRANEANIST'S COLLECTION Henri Pharaons " Treasure House of Arab Art" Abstract Henri Pharaons mansion in Beirut is a unique artifact among Lebanese urban elite establishments. Built in the late nineteenth century, it houses one of Lebanon's most significant collections of art objects displayed in an extraordinary setting of authentic Ottoman interiors dating from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century. Conceived by Henri Pharaon during the formative years of the Lebanese nation state (1929-63), the house amalgamates objects from the regions multilayered cul- tures and religions. This paper proceeds from the idea of a house as an extension of self and explores the personal drives, nationalist aspirations, and cultural con- structs that may have shaped the making of the Pharaon mansion. HENRI PHARAON'S LATE NINETEENTH-CENTURY MANSION, located in a historic quarter of Beirut, houses one of the most significant collections of art objects in Lebanon (fig. I).1 Screened by high walls and tall cypress trees, the beau- tiful garden and house conceal a lifetime of connoisseurship and acquisition. The collection conveys the historical layering of the region, from the Phoenician to the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic periods. Most striking is the collections extraordinary setting. The house holds the largest assemblage of authentic Otto- man interiors - lacquered and painted wood panels and ceilings, marble and stone carving - assembled from demolished Damascene and Aleppine houses dating from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century. These interiors have been studied and published in a catalogue by Dorothea Duda,2 whereas only a selection of the most outstanding pieces was recently featured in a catalogue commissioned by the new owner of the mansion, Robert Mouawad, a renowned jeweler who transformed the house into a private museum that carries his name.3 This study is a preliminary exploration into the making of the house and the drive, ideas, aspirations, and affectations that may have guided the selection of the objects and shaped their display setting. The collector Henri Pharaon (1898-1993) was a man of great wealth and political clout who contributed to the shaping of the Lebanese nation state during the French Mandate period (1920-43) and after Lebanon's independence in 1943 (fig. 2). 4 His wealth and hospitality were prover- bial, and his opulent house, which acquired a wondrous reputation, became the embodiment of Lebanese refinement and high culture. Conceived in the crucible of Lebanese nation building, the house stands as a significant witness to Lebanon's modern history. Henri Pharaon belonged to a prominent Greek Catholic family that traces its origin to the region of Hawran in Syria.5 After moving to Damascus in the sev- enteenth century, many members of the family, along with other coreligionists, 103</page><page sequence="3">Henri Pharaon in front of his mansion. Courtesy arabianEye. relocated to several Ottoman and European cities, such as Haifa, Cairo, Alexan- dria, Venice, Trieste, and Paris.6 In addition to being entrepreneurial and busi- ness-oriented, the family was cosmopolitan, speaking French and easily moving back and forth among Europe, Egypt, and Lebanon. It built its wealth in the silk and textile trade with Europe at the turn of the twentieth century. 7 This was further consolidated with the establishment of the first private bank in Beirut, in partnership with the Chiha family, with whom the Pharaons had close alliances through marriage.8 Born in 1898 in Alexandria in his grandfathers house, Pharaon moved with his parents to Beirut in 1900. He was educated in French missionary schools there before he left for Switzerland during World War I. He then joined the faculty of law at the University of Lyons, a choice determined by the strong commercial, finan- cial, and cultural ties that existed between the weaving industry of Lyons and the bourgeois Christian milieu of Beirut and Mount Lebanon.9 Upon the death of his father in 1922, Henri Pharaon returned to Beirut to assume the presidency of the family bank. During the late Ottoman period, Beirut had emerged as a provincial capital, a major entrepot on the Mediterranean and the gateway to the Syrian interior. Its port and a vast network of trans-Mediterranean exchanges with Europe were the main vectors of its transformation.10 Beiruts highly effective and powerful mercan- tile class was connected to all the major centers of the Ottoman Empire and to other European cities. It prospered by means of its wide-ranging financial activities, its banks, and its credit and real-estate investments, which significantly distinguished it from the traditional class of notables.11 In 1920 the establishment of the French Mandate in the former Ottoman prov- inces created the new political entity of Greater Lebanon. It was composed of the Christian Mount Lebanon to which were annexed territories parceled out from the former provinces of Damascus and Beirut. The French created an entity that ensured the numerical supremacy and guaranteed the political privilege of one confessional group, namely, the Christian Maronites of Mount Lebanon. This was done to the detriment of local Muslims and Druzes, who felt coerced into joining this invented nation. A nationalist narrative, advocated by Christian intellectuals, traced the historical presence of Lebanon to ancient Phoenicia and underplayed the Arab and Islamic past, placing the nations historical and geographical bound- aries exclusively within a Mediterranean culture.12 The dichotomy that resulted between Muslim and Christian, and conflicts over Lebanon's national identity, became sources of discord in the checkered history of that nation. Upon his return to Beirut, Henri Pharaon immediately entered the political fray and remained an important power broker, and a behind-the-scenes influential IO4 MAY FARHAT</page><page sequence="4">presence, until the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war in 1975.13 His extraordinary wealth, vested in banking, major real estate holdings, horse racing, and a monopoly over the management of the port of Beirut, gave him the freedom and autonomy to support the political causes that served his personal and business interests. It is the mansion and the exceptional collection of antique objects collected within its walls, however, that best defined his public image. lhe house was built in 1901 by Philippe Pharaon, Henri Pharaons father, a prominent banker and businessman, and was located in the neighborhood of Zuqaq al-Blat (the Paved Road) that developed outside the walls of Old Beirut.14 There, many aristocratic families and members of the mercantile bourgeoisie built houses surrounded by gardens and overlooking the scenic bay of Beirut. It com- bined a central hall plan- a type common in the residential architecture of the region- along with an Italianate neo-Gothic exterior that agreed with the architec- tural eclecticism dominant in turn-of-the-century Beirut.15 The style of the house replicated architectural fashion popular in coastal cities around the Mediterranean, and it profiled the Pharaon family's connections to a European and cosmopolitan world. Marble floors and unadorned walls painted in a light green color formed the original décor.16 Pillaged during World War I - which the Pharaon family waited out in Alexandria - the house was briefly used as a residence for the French gover- nor in 1924. 17 Five years later, in 1929, Henri Pharaon began to restore and refur- bish his house. Pharaon originally intended to incorporate one "Arab Salon" ( salon arabe) into his mansion, following an established fashion in Lebanese elite houses. The vogue of the Arab Salon had originated in nineteenth-century European interiors, where they were designated as "smoking rooms." These were found in many aristocratic residences and summer homes not only in France, England, and the United States but also in Cairo, where they became integral to the bourgeois house.18 The passion of many French and British collectors for Middle Eastern objects is well known.19 In France, in particular, many collectors were engaged in assembling large hold- ings of such artifacts around the turn of the century. Some of the most elaborate reconstructions were done in Cairo, such as the Hôtel Saint-Maurice, which was built from an expert assemblage of authentic fragments and copies to recreate an imposing mansion.20 In Beirut, General Henri Gouraud, who served as Frances High Commissioner from 1919 to 1923, added an Arab Salon to the French official residence,21 and there is no doubt that the Lebanese aristocratic classes adopted this fashion by way of French Orientalism. By his own account, two factors spurred Pharaons passion for collecting archi- tectural interiors. His travels to Syria, in search of the purebred Arabian horses that he raised, took him into the homes of Damascene and Aleppine notables, where he 105 A MEDITERRANEANIST'S COLLECTION</page><page sequence="5">3 View of the garden. 4 Anthropomorphic Phoenician sarcophagus from the fifth century bce in front of the main entrance, with a view toward the Mediterranean. was impressed by the intricacies of the decoration and the marble floors. Pharaons visit to the Azem Palace in 1929 furthered his infatuation with Syrian interiors. Built by As ad Pasha, governor of Damascus in the mid-eighteenth century, the Azem Palace was acquired by the French government in 1922, and it became the location of the French Institute of Archaeology and Islamic Art as well as the resi- dence of the High Commissioner.22 During an attack by rebels in the 1925 insurrec- tion, part of the palace was burned down and its collection pillaged. Restored by the French, the Azem Palace functioned as a catalyst for Phar- aons imaginative recasting of his father s European-inspired mansion in Zuqaq al-Blat, and it mediated his interest in Bilad al-Shams historical visual culture. Although the Pharaon family originally came from Syria, Henri Pharaons mul- tiple displacements among Cairo, Beirut, Switzerland, and France established a physical as well as a cultural distance from what he knew to be part of his family history. The splendid and seductive Damascene and Aleppine interiors came as a revelation to Pharaon. If Aleppine and Damascene houses spurred the aesthetic appreciation and covetousness of Pharaon, the Azem Palace in Damascus pro- vided the total vision. His goal became to surpass the Azem Palace in splendor and riches, and he often boasted later in life that he owned the best palace in the region. Ironically, the order by the French to bomb Damascus in 1925 in an effort to quell the insurrection resulted in the destruction of a significant number of old houses, which infused the antiquity market with discarded interiors and architec- tural fragments. Helped by old craftsmen, Pharaon collected ceilings, wainscoting, crumbling walls, tile pavements, mural revetments, isolated cornices, fragments of fireplaces, and fountains, which were photographed in situ, numbered, and trans- ported overland with great care to storage areas.23 The architectural elements were restored in ateliers and incorporated into various rooms of the house. Old tech- niques were revived as a way to refurbish the painted woodwork, and disused mar- ble quarries were rediscovered in order to complete the marble mosaics. The cost of 106 MAY FARHAT</page><page sequence="6">5 Plan of the ground floor. From The Future of the Past (Beirut: Robert Mouawad Private Museum, 2004). restoring and refitting the various elements in the mansion was far greater than all the previous costs incurred by their purchase and transportation. Concomitantly, Pharaon collected objects from throughout the region. Many of them found their way to his doorstep by way of antiquarians who knew of his acquisitiveness. This resulted in the accumulation of large quantities of objects that belonged to the diverse material culture of the region: carved stone capitals, ceramics, metalwork, glass, carpets, vases, sarcophagi, statues, manuscripts, and icons. Archaeologists at the French Institute of Archaeology in Beirut provided the expertise and the scholarship that bolstered the drive to acquire works of art which Pharaon and other Lebanese collectors shared.24 Pharaon displayed many of these objects - Phoenician and Byzantine statues as well as architectural frag- ments of Syrian provenance - in his walled garden, amidst fountains, lawns, and flower beds. Stone capitals lining the garden alleys present dizzying variations on the acanthus leaf motif, dating from the Roman to the early Islamic period (fig. 3). An enigmatic Phoenician anthropomorphic sarcophagus dating to the fifth cen- tury BCE and found in Sidon marks the axis of the main entrance door and signals the primacy of Phoenicia (fig. 4). To renovate his house, Pharaon engaged Lucien Cavro (1905-1973), a French architect and a graduate of the Ecole des Beaux Arts de Lille, who was participat- ing in the restoration of the Azem Palace, the mosaics of the Umayyad mosque of Damascus, and other archaeological digs in Syria.25 The houses main entrance leads to a central space around which are organized many reception rooms and a 107 A MEDITERRANE ANIST'S COLLECTION</page><page sequence="7">6 View of the salon facing the main entrance (Gl 2 and Gl 3 on the floor plan). grand dining room (fig. 5). Between 1929 and 1963 fourteen reception rooms were recreated inside the mansion from fragments collected through assiduous searches in the old palaces of Damascus and Aleppo. Based on Cavros account, which was published in the pamphlet Portrait dune Maison that included essays written by friends of Pharaon, the major receptions rooms were refitted with wood ceilings, paneling, wall incrustation, and marble floors from 1929 to 1932 (fig. 6). Work proceeded slowly. The dining room was finished in 1957-58, and the rooms of the upper floor were not completed until 1963.26 Pharaon was constantly working on his house, and the death of Lucien Cavro in 1973, a loss Pharaon felt deeply, prob- ably put a halt to his restoration mania. The eclectic yet harmonious combination of disparate decorative elements and the careful blending of styles can best be admired in the dining room, a stately and light-filled room that frames the elongated and simple dining table at its center (fig. 7). In the absence of a traditional Ottoman house to emulate, the dining room reveals a blending of styles and objects that was not present in the central salons, which had been restored earlier. The wooden ceiling with geometric patterns came from an Aleppo house, while the carved and painted marble panels that carry Arabic religious inscriptions and are offset by smaller Dutch tiles painted in shades of cobalt blue display the same motif of vases holding bouquets of flow- ers. Inside the tympanum of the entrance stone arch,27 a desacralized iconostasis is framed on either side by marble panels with floral motifs and Arabic religious inscriptions (fig. 8). Furthermore, two bronze lion heads were inserted on either side of the arcades. 108 MAY FARHAT</page><page sequence="8">7 View of the dining room (Gl 0, Gl 1, and G9 on the floor plan). 8 Dining room, with a view of the iconostasis above the door. Unlike museums, which are constrained by specific organizing principles and taxonomies, private holdings are defined by the collectors imagination and are perceived as the extension of self. In her insightful book on collections and sou- venirs, Susan Stewart highlights important aspects of the act of acquiring works: "Whereas the souvenir s role or purpose is the remembering or the invention of memory, the point of collecting is forgetting, or starting again, in such a way that a finite number of elements create, by virtue of their combination, an infinite rev- erie."28 This evocation of an infinite reverie finds expression in the many essays included in the pamphlet Portrait dune Maison.29 For French archaeologist Mau- rice Dunand and others, Pharaons house epitomizes the enchantment of a Palace of the Orient, with its opulence and splendor. It preserves past traditions that were being effaced by modernity. The mansion is an oasis of calm and beauty, a world of the imagination where the accumulation of the riches of the Orient provokes feelings of wonder and rapture. The juxtaposition of objects, the thick layering of Turkish and Persian carpets muffling the sound of footsteps, the Dutch tiles from Delft, and the delicate decoration of the wood panels create a sheltered world of harmony and order. Much of this leads us to think Henri Pharaon was staging his own imaginary Orient while he was rejecting the noisy, messy, modern world that was developing right outside his garden enclosure. A more subtle reading is suggested, however, in a concluding paragraph by Camille Aboussouan, a bibliophile, collector, and like Henri Pharaon, an eminent member of the Lebanese Christian elite. A house is the reflection of the moral and intellectual order of a man. It is the country of his spontaneous creation, the motherland of his intelligence. When a seemingly austere aesthetic order enlivens with water jets and colors, with flowers and drawings, the interior frame of a daily life, when this order brings Arab and Lebanese art together with remembrances (sou- venirs) of the magnificence of Phoenicia, of Greece, and of Byzantium, it 109 A MEDITERRANE ANIST'S COLLECTION</page><page sequence="9">testifies in an admirable way to Humanism, to this Civilization of Thought and Art that is every mans honor, and without which Lebanon cannot conceive itself.30 Pharaon did not wish to write his memoirs, nor did he leave much writ- ing behind; an archive of his personal papers has yet to surface. He did, however, give many interviews late in his life. He spoke about his house and the desires and wishes he invested in it. In an interview given in 1985, he commented, "I wanted to make of this place a house for the brotherly co-existence among religious sects/ confessions ( tawaif ). Thus you see Quranic verses, crosses, icons and Islamic man- uscripts all gathered together. I wanted to make this house- my first homeland- what we wanted to make of Lebanon." 31 This vision, he elaborated, was shaped by his experience as a student in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he witnessed peaceful coexistence among different nationalities (French, German, and Italian) and reli- gious denominations. This idea of Lebanon as the Switzerland of the East, which had wide currency among Lebanese intellectuals, was often repeated but not thor- oughly examined. The house, conceived by Henri Pharaon as an amalgam of many cultures and religions, is the visual expression of a "Mediterraneanist ideology" expounded by Michel Chiha (1891-1954), Pharaons brother-in-law and business associate, and the attitude was shared by many other Lebanese intellectuals in their circle. Chiha, a successful businessman as well as a political thinker, was instrumental in drafting the Lebanese Constitution of 1926 that was commissioned by the French Mandate authority. 32 He is held responsible for the confessional system of government that established a power-sharing arrangement among the different religious groups.33 In a series of books and articles, Chiha articulated a nationalist ideology that advo- cated Lebanon's Mediterranean identity, which goes back to Phoenician times. He argued they were neither Phoenician nor Arab but simply Lebanese, a people of dis- tinct characteristics comprising a mixture of ethnic and religious communities tied together by a common history and geographical location.34 This approach embod- ied Henri Pharaons strong belief that Lebanon is an entity with historical depth. It was not an artificial construct made possible by historical conjecture, mediated by French colonial power, and shaped by the Christian minority's interests in a pre- dominantly Arab Muslim milieu. Henri Pharaons mansion was never set up as a private museum in his lifetime, but it was visited and admired by prominent foreign visitors, kings, rulers, and gov- ernment officials who left enthusiastic comments in a golden book that Pharaon treasured. With the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war in 1975 - and the fracturing of the nation - the house was caught in a no-mans-land between the two warring 110 MAY FARHAT</page><page sequence="10">sides of the city. Miraculously, it survived looting and destruction, which was prob- ably achieved at great expense by paying off the various warring factions. Following the tragic assassination of Pharaon in 1993, the house was sold by his only surviv- ing son to Robert Mouawad, who transformed it into a private museum where the house s staggering riches could be seen by the public. With its European exterior and Ottoman interiors, the houses hybridity defies categorization and often puzzles its visitors. Without Pharaon, whose consuming passion, single-mindedness, and imagination animated its spaces, the house stands as a relic of a not-so-distant past, in a country where questions of national identity and belonging remain unresolved, contested, and mercurial.
