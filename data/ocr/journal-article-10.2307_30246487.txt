SMITH ABSTRACT For the prehistoric petroglyphs of the southwestern United States, the search con- tinues to correlate these symbols to geographic features, astronomical phenome- na or human activity. In central Arizona, a serendipitous discovery of a panel of petroglyphs has led to a potential correlation between the abstract symbols and topographic and location information. This paper summarizes the location, design features and interpretation concerning these petroglyphs. RESUMEN Para el petroglyphs prehist6rico de los Estados Unidos del sudoeste, la bdsqueda continda poner en correlaccidn estos simbolos a caracteristicas geogrdficas, los fendmenos astron6micos o la actividad humana. En Arizona central, un descubrimiento de serendip- itous de un entrepafio de petroglyphs ha llevado a una correlaci6n potencial entre los sim- bolos abstractos y topogrdfico e informacidn de ubicaci6n. Este papel resume la ubicaci6n, las caracteristicas del disefio e interpretacidn con respecto a estos petroglyphs. Although historic Native American tribes in various portions of North America are known to have produced maps on various materials other than stone (Warhus 1997), reasonably convincing examples of petroglyph maps are infrequently encountered (Wellman 1979:131). The best examples for well- documented maps as part of a prehistoric rock art tradition are the late prehis- toric to early historic period Plateau style of the Columbia-Fraser River plateau in British Columbia (Wellman 1979:45). In these petroglyphs, outlines of lakeshores, the courses of rivers and streams, and the silhouettes of mountains are depicted (Corner 1968:29). From the American Southwest, several possible examples of petroglyph 'maps' have been identified. Gortner (1988, 1989) describes a petroglyph in the KIVA: The Journal of Southwestern Archaeology and History, Vol. 70, No. 4, (Summer 2005), pp. 413-420 Copyright + 2005 Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society.

SMITH north-central Sierra Nevada Mountains of California that maps the petroglyph site and connecting trails along the north fork of the American River. Schroeder (1952) reported a possible prehistoric rock art map encoun- tered during a survey along the lower Colorado River. "A few of the linear drawings observed appear to be maps, one being a per- fect representation of the bends of the Colorado River from Toprock south to Mojave Rock at site L: 7:3" (Schroeder 1952: 44). Among the Hohokam petroglyphs of the Picacho Mountains in south-cen- tral Arizona, the single most distinctive petroglyph located at Picacho Point is thought to represent an outline map of the ridge upon which the site is located (Wallace and Holmlund 1986:147). An important observation derived from the analysis of this petroglyph is that it has been slightly distorted to compensate for the viewer's ground perception. In this case, the position of a small fan of alluvi- um and rock fall has been exaggerated in the rock art. As this alluvial fan pro- vides a relatively wide area of flat land between the base of the slope and the wash, the location of this topographic feature may have had specific interest to those who viewed the petroglyph. Another good example of a representative map can be found in the large petroglyph panel on display near the Kitt Peak Visitors Center west of Tucson, Arizona. Wallace and Holmlund (1986) indicate that this petroglyph depicts an outline map of a Hohokam house cluster with clear outlines of pithouses, com- plete with entryways, drawn facing a central courtyard. Dart and Homlund (1990:28) have determined the original position of this petroglyph panel to the west slope of the Coyote Mountains from Arizona State Museum site AZ DD: 2:17. These examples suggests that these petroglyphs may have been used for utilitarian purposes (such as a map), although it is always important to recog- nize that the interpretation we make today may not reflect the overall use of the petroglyph by the original designer(s). SITE LOCATION AND PETROGLYPH DESCRIPTION The petroglyph site is located in an area of Prescott National Forest, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), State and private grazing lands in the Chino Valley, Yavapai County, north of Prescott, Arizona (Figure 1). At this time, the site has yet to be designated with an Arizona State Museum (ASM) site number. This area lies along the drainage divide separating rapidly downcutting canyons extending headward from the Verde River and lower gradient tributaries flowing west into the upper non-incised region of Granite Creek. Elevation ranges from 4600 to 5500 feet and the area is sparsely vegetated with an annual rainfall of less than 10 inches per year. The site was located during geologic field mapping exercises in the Proterozoic to Tertiary strata exposed in this region. In addition to the</page><page sequence="3">A PREHISTORIC PETROGLYPH MAP IN CENTRAL ARIZONA 415 Paulden Perkinsville i ~erde River Site Clarkdale Jerome Chino Valley Cottonwood , d Flagstaff Prescott *Phoenix Tucson N FIGURE 1 Location map of the petroglyph site. described panel, several small isolated single motif petroglyphs and one picto- graph panel (probably post-Classic period) were observed in the immediate area along with a variety of ceramic sherds (Hohokam, Anasazi, and brown Mogol- Ion wares as well as non-diagnostic plainware) and lithic fragments. The petroglyph panel is located in a recessed alcove in the Middle Protero- zoic Yavapai Group rocks that form the walls of the steep-walled canyon of Gran- ite Creek (Figure 2). The rock is a very durable reddish brown quartzite with a thin brown patina coating. The main panel is located just below present eyelev- el. However, sedimentary alluvium deposits from the seasonal flow of the Gran- ite Creek have filled in the base of the alcove, indicating that when the petroglyphs were pecked they had been positioned above eye level in the alcove. The petroglyph panel is composed of (at least) six associated motifs (Fig- ure 2). The central motif (Figure 2c, e, f) is an irregular form with an overall V- shaped (open to the left) form and modified by crenulations and two broadly circular ovals. It is possible that this may represent two or three associated petro- glyphs that represent one composite petroglyph. There is some variation in line width and depth of pecking, which may indicate this or may be a result of the variable hardness of this quartzite. There is also a sun figure motif (Figure 2a) oriented directly above the central motif that has later pecking added to the</page><page sequence="4">416 JAMES A. DOCKAL AND MICHAEL 5.

An anthropomorphic form (Figure 2b) is located to the left of the central motif. A large game animal motif (Figure 2g), similar in style to Hohokam elements found at other sites, is found to the left of the central motif and below the anthropomorphic form, near the current floor of the alcove. The patina of the most of the motifs is similar and suggests contemporaneous for- mation. Although the overall condition of the panel is fair, the episodic seasonal flooding in the canyon is slowly destroying these petroglyphs.</page><page sequence="5">A PREHISTORIC PETROGLYPH MAP IN CENTRAL ARIZONA 417 CULTURAL TRADITIONS IN THE VERDE VALLEY REGION Although prehistoric occupation of this region ranges in time from the Archaic to the fifteenth century, the petrogylphs of the region have been attribut- ed to peoples from the Western Archaic to the post 1450 A.D. Navajo and Pueblo cultures. The oldest of these petroglyphs are in the Great Basin Abstract style and are thought to be related to the Western Archaic (1000 B.C. to ~100 A.D.) mem- bers of a hunting and gathering culture. These people developed survival strate- gies adapted to the arid to semi-arid conditions of this region. Their petroglyphs consist of elemental abstract designs, both curvilinear and rectilinear (Schaafs- ma, 1980). The major cultural group of the Verde River - Salt River - Gila River area of Arizona was the Hohokam. They were horticulturalists that lived in the river val- leys and deserts of south-central Arizona from 300 B.C. to 1450 A.D (Schaafsma, 1980). They are thought to represent a migration of people from the south that brought with them an agricultural expertise based upon the use of extensive irri- gation systems (Haury, 1976). Hohokam villages usually consisted of scattered clusters of houses until the Classic Period (1100 - 1450 A.D.). Their petroglyphs include abstract and representational elements. The abstract elements include spirals and sunbursts, as well as curvilinear meanders and mazes. The representational elements include a variety of quadrupeds (large game animals and dogs), human figures, reptiles, birds and insects. Away from the irrigated river valleys and permanent habitations, petro- glyphs are also found in connection with campsites, trails and other transient activities (White, 1965; Snyder, 1966; Kearns, 1973). The Hohokam made sub- stantial use of wild food resources of all types, from the mesquite, saltbush and creosote flats as well as the saguaro - Palo Verde ecological communities, espe- cially in drought years. In addition, evidence for hunting of small and large game animals and other foraging techniques is suggested by the lithic and ceramic debris associated with some of these petroglyph sites. Two other contemporaneous cultural groups who may have contributed to the petroglyphs in the Verde Valley were the Mogollon to the east and the Anasazi to the north (Schaafsma, 1980). Little is known about their presence in this region, although non-diagnostic plainware and lithic remains sometimes have a few sherds of black-on-white Anasazi and brown Mogollon wares. This suggests that their presence cannot be discounted and potential for either con- struction or utilization of the petroglyphs described in this study. Post Classic Period cultures that have left their mark in the Verde Valley are the Navajo and Pueblo groups (Schaafsma, 1980). A few possible Hopi clan symbols were observed in the watercourse channel walls near the location of the ceramic and lithic remains. The pictographs found to the west of the described panel may be of this period.</page><page sequence="6">418 JAMES A. DOCKAL AND MICHAEL 5. SMITH DISCUSSION In the field area, Granite Creek is the major seasonal waterway. During high sum- mer it is dry except for a few water pockets that hold some water even in the dri- est years. Numerous plainware pottery sherds, as well as a few Anasazi black-on-white, brown Mogollon plainware and red-on-black Hohokam and Gila Plain wares, and lithic fragments are found on the gently sloping fields that face the course of Granite Creek adjacent to, but a short distance upstream (to the south) from, the petroglyph site (Figure 1). This location, with its gentle slope, advantageous position near the watercourse and away from the higher cliff faces, would have been an ideal site for a seasonal camp. Downstream (to the north) from these fields, Granite Creek flows through a steep walled canyon and rugged, basalt-capped terrain. Eventually Granite Creek joins the Verde River to the north, about five miles distant from the site (Figure 1 and Figure 3d). Cross- country travel from the southern end of the Chino Valley toward the Verde Valley would have been along the lip of the canyon until you reached the petroglyph panel locality (Figure 3d). Here, due to an erosional difference in the rock types of the Yavapai Group metamorphic rocks, an easily negotiable cleft has been formed that leads to the bottom of the canyon and back out on the opposite side where travel would have continued on to the Verde Valley. In addition, this loca- tion is shaded and cool during high summer. The main panel (Figure 2) consists of an anthropomorphic figure, a possi- ble sun figure, two irregular wavy or crooked lines, and a second wavy line or possibly snakes figure and two oval loops. Immediately below these and only a few centimeters above the sand bed of the canyon floor is a single isolated large game animal figure similar to many Hohokam sites (Figure 2g). The two sets of crooked or wavy lines (Figure 2c and 2d) are slightly different from each other with respect to the depth of pecking and line widths and may represent later modifications. The sun figure to the top of the central motif is of particular interests in that it may be an orientation mark much as our modern maps have an arrow that indicates the direction of magnetic north. If the petroglyph panel is taken as a flat map that is oriented with the top to the south as suggested by the sun sym- bol, then the other markings match closely the actual spatial configuration of the local geography (Figure 3a, c). A person thus reading the map could realize the spatial position of the indicated map features relative to the mid-day solar posi- tion. With this interpretation the anthropomorphic figure to the left of the cen- tral motif may indicate passage or travel into this canyon or represent the posi- tion of the petroglyph panel on the map. The wavy line motif extending to the right corresponds to the canyon and course of Granite Creek heading west and down stream (Figure 3c). The hairpin bend in the wavy line matches the sharp bend in the course of Granite Creek where the canyon turns sharply toward the</page><page sequence="7">A PREHISTORIC PETROGLYPH MAP IN CENTRAL ARIZONA 419 .. . . .. .. ~~~*.~~+W ate pocket +* . k MI i A.

The wavy line motif then extends to the right and joins two exaggerated closed oval loops. These closed oval loops correspond to the position of deep- water pockets in the canyon, which are accessible only by following-the canyon floor from the petroglyph panel. These held water even late in the summer dur- ing some of the recent dry years and were the only natural water source in the area. The water pockets also contained numerous water snakes that may be rep- resented by the wavy line adjacent to the oval loops. The left side of this wavy line has what might be a head, but the preservation is poor. The waviness of this line is much more uniform than that of the 'canyon' symbol and it portrays quite accurately how the water snakes in the water pocket appear while swimming.</page><page sequence="8">420 )AMES A. DOCKAL AND MICHAEL S. SMITH CONCLUSIONS Petroglyphs almost certainly served more than one function in prehistoric soci- eties. Although many interpretations have been made based upon religious/shamanistic and hunting relationships, few direct connections of this rock art with geographic features, landscape relations or maps have been report- ed. Often petroglyphs and pictographs are associated with locations important in the prehistoric subsistence patterns of the artists (Wellman 1979: 60). Although the petroglyph panel of this study provides a strong argument for an association between the local topography and spatial (solar and geographic) ori- entation, any further inferences into the connection of these symbols and the search and acquisition of water and food must await further study.
