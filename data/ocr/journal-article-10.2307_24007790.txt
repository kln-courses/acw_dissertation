<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE ΜΕΝ IN A ROW (Studies in the Trivandrum Plays II)* By Herman Tieken, Leiden Introduction In Pancarätra as well as in Abhiseka, Ürubhanga and Madhyama we come across a curious set of three speakers. Pancarätra (Pr.) opens with three brahmins describing a ritual which they supervise; in Abhiseka (Abh.) three vidyädharas describe the battle taking place between Räma and Rävana; Ürubhanga (Übh.) opens with three sol diers who describe the battle fought off-stage by Bhlma and Duryo dhana; Madhyama (Ma.), finally, présents a special case. For while in the plays just mentioned the three men feature in the interludes, in Madhyama three brahmin youths are the main characters of the play. In all instances the three men, simply numbered 'the first', 'the se cond', and 'the third', speak one after the other, sometimes sharing between them the text of a single verse1. This threesome seems to be peculiar to these four plays. The question of their origin has so far, however, not been satisfactorily answered, if raised at all2. In this connection it is important to note that when the three persons leave the stage it is in all four cases to attend a ritual: * Retrospectively my article 'The So-called Trivandrum Plays Attribu ted to Bhäsa' (Tieken 1993) might be labelled 'Studies in the Trivandrum Plays I'. — I wish to express my gratitude to Prof. Dr. Heidrun Brückner, Prof. Dr. Henk W. Bodewitz and to Prof. Dr. Jan C. Heesterman for their commente on an earlier version of this article. I also wish to thank Dr. Chlodwig H. Werba, who, among other things, kindly provided me with a copy of Zin-Oczkowska's doctoral dissertation on the Udayana plays from Trivandrum; in my studies of the Trivandrum plays until then I had to work without the benefit of this important book. 1 See Abh.

More recently, Brückner (1995: 51), while duly noting the similarity between the description in Pr. of Duryodhana's räjasüya by three brahmins and, e. g., the description of the duel between Räma and Rävana by three vidyâdharas in Abh., does not venture into spéculations on their origin.

Tikkkn Duryodhana's räjasüya in Pancarätra, Räma's abhiseka in Abhiseka, Duryodhana's niväpa (érâddha) in Ürubhaiiga, and a relative's upa nayana in Madhyama. As to the origin of this set of persons it will be suggested that it cannot be a coïncidence that their number corre sponds exactly to the number of brahmins required at each of these rituals3. On closer considération these three 'brahmins' appear to be but one aspect of the dominant concern of the plays, which is ritual. For instance, in Abhiseka, and the same applies to Pratimä, the 'happy ending' consists of the completion of Räma's abhiseka which had been interrupted at the beginning of the play. An even more interesting case is the Pancarätra, the plot of which, as I will try to show, runs parallel to, or duplicates, albeit in a scrambled form, the course of the räjasüya. The dramatic tension of Madhyama appears to be made up of the brahmin family's anxiety as to whether they will be able to arrive in füll number at their relative's son's initiation. By their concern with ritual, which as far as I know has not been noticed so far,4 these four plays are unique within the Sanskrit drama tic tradition. For this reason an attempt will have to be made to situate the plays in the history of Sanskrit drama. This involves taking up the so-called Bhâsa theory according to which the plays would belong to the oldest strata of Sanskrit drama. While recently a considérable amount of evidence was brought to light which casts doubt on this theory (see below, p. 34), and consequently the early date assigned to the plays, the unique concern of the plays with ritual appears to be yet another factor which is difficult to reconcile with the Bhäsa theory. Instead all evidence points to the conclusion that the plays originated from a relatively recent regional tradition of playwri t-ing in South India. In connection with the identification of the three persons it should be noted that for rituals in général the presence of brahmins is absolu tely essential. Sacrificer and brahmins are bound, as it were, by a pact: while the sacrificer is obliged to invite and feed the required number of brahmins for the ritual to be effective, the brahmins for their part, once invited, are obliged to show up on pain of being reborn a swine. However, allowances are made for cases of emergency (äpaddharma), when the sacrificer may, for instance, get by with a smaller number of brahmins. While ideally it is the deceased's aurasa son who is enjoined 3 This finding overrules any attempt to explain the set of three persons in général terms, for instance, by taking the number three as synonymous with the notion of totality (for which. see Gonda 1976). 4 It should be noted that "Opfer" in Brückner's article (1995) stands for English "victim".</page><page sequence="3">Three Men in a Row 19 to organise the sräddha, the same äpad-rule allows for his substitution by a son of a less direct type of descent. For these situations some texts, among them the Mänava Dharmasâstra, use the terms pratha mah kalpah 'first class (performance)' and anukalpah 'second best (performance)' respectively. As I will try to show, the expression prathamah kalpah was borrowed by playwrights as early as Asvaghosa from these texts, or directly from the mouths of ritual experts, into their plays. While originally prathamah kalpah was most likely used by way of a joke, it evolved into a standard reaction to a good suggestion. In Abhiseka, Ürubhanga and Madhyama, however, prathamah kalpah is used, one may be tempted to say, again, by 'brahmins' to express their agreement to the suggestion that they join the ritual. Apart from the question of the origin of prathamah kalpah as a 'dramatic' expres sion,5 the second reason to discuss it here is to forestall the conclusion that in these three instances we would have to do with the use of the expression in its original technical sense, and that therefore the plays concerned belong to the oldest strata of Sanskrit drama. Before elabo rating on these conclusions the four plays will each be considered more closely. Pancarâtra The action of Pancarâtra takes place at the end of the final, thir teenth year of the Pândavas' exile, during which they are staying incognito at the court of the king of Virâta. First, however, we are introduced to the court of Duryodhana, who is performing a räjasüya. The first act begins with an interlude (viskambhaka) in which three brahmins, watching from nearby, describe the avabhrthasnâna, one of the last parts of the ritual. After having described, among other things, the great number of brahmins which is being honoured at the occasion, they notice that, before the avabhrthasnâna has actually been finished6, their pupils (mânavaka) have allowed the sacrificial fire to escape. At this point they actually interfère with the proceedings by warning their pupils to be more careful. After having taken a bath the brahmins see Duryodhana approaching, accompanied by Bhlsma, Drona and a 'circle' (mandata) of kings. 5 The occurrence of the term prathamah kalpah in plays has been discus sed previously by Lévi (1963: 11/12), Keith (1924: 112n. 2), Lindenau (1918: 37f.) and Schokker (1966: 161 f.). For Dhanika, who in his commentary on Dasarüpa I 60 denied that prathamah kalpah was a dramatic expression be cause it was not mentioned in Nätyasästra, see SCHOKKER, 1. c. 11 anavasite 'vabhrthasnäne (Pr. I: 374,15f. [prose after v. 5]).</page><page sequence="4">20 H. Tieken Thereupon, the three brahmins leave the stage in order, as they say, to greet Duryodhana. Subsequently, Duryodhana enters, accompanied by his three teachers and advisers, namely Drona, Bhïsma and Sakuni, and his companion (vayasya) Karna. Ail four congratulate Duryodhana on the completion of the sacrifice7. Sakuni, however, uses the occasion to exhort Duryo dhana into action again,8 urging him to conquer all kings in the same way as was done by Jaräsandha during his räjasüya Next, Duryodhana is congratulated by Abhimanyu, Sahadeva, and the 'circle of kings'. At this point Duryodhana notices the absence of the king of Virâta. Sakuni informs him, however, that he has already sent a messenger to enquire about the reason for this king's absence but that the messenger has not yet returned. After that, Duryodhana announces his desire to grant Drona a daksinâ and asks his teacher what he would like to have. Drona is hésitant to tell him what he really wants, but after Duryodhana has solemnly pledged to grant his âcârya s wish, whatever it may be, Drona asks him to share the realm with his cousins, the Pândavas. Sakuni accuses Drona of abusing the situation, and on his advice Duryodhana adds a condition, namely that he will grant the daksinâ only if Drona mana ges to bring news of the Pândavas within fïve days. Now it is Drona's turn to feel cheated as nobody has heard anything from the Pândavas for more than twelve years. At this point the messenger returns from the Virâta king, informing Duryodhana that the king could not come because he was mourning for the death of his relatives, the Kïcakas. The latter had heen slain by an unidentified person who fought only with his bare hands. In this remarkable feat Bhïsma recognizes the work of Bhïma. He therefore advises Drona to accept Duryodhana's condition, at the same time fabricating an excuse for Duryodhana to attack Virâta and to lift the latter king's cattle. Bhïsma feels certain that the Pândavas will show up in order to assist the Virâta king, thus revealing their identity. Ail présent préparé to départ for the battle, agreeing that Sakuni should occupy the first chariot and lead the campaign10.

Yudhisthira for his part wonders why Bhlsma himself had been among the robbers, and surmises that Bhlsma was actually trying to teil him that their promise to stay away for thirteen years has been nearly fulfilled. When Viräta Orders his chariot to be prepared for the attack he is told that his son Uttara has already taken it, accompanied by the trans vestite Brhannalä as charioteer, who is actually Arjuna. The outcome of the battle is revealed in stages. First, a soldier enters saying that Uttara's chariot has run aground near the crémation ground. The king is worried and becomes annoyed by Yudhisthira's laconic reaction. The latter, however, knows that it was at the créma tion ground that Arjuna had hid his mighty bow Gändlva. The king sends the soldier away in order to collect further information. The soldier re-enters with news of the victory. The Kauravas had been drowned under a shower of arrows Coming from Uttara's chariot. While everybody was under the impression that the arrows were shot by Uttara, it was actually the work of Brhannalä, alias Arjuna. Dro na, however, was not fooled. He had immediately recognized the twang of Arjuna's bow and had retreated from battle. Also, Bhlsma, when he had seen an arrow shot into the standard (dhvaja) of his chariot, had ordered the battle to end. The only soldier who seemed undaunted was Abhimanyu. Yudhisthira, fearing a battle between father (Brhannalä, i. e. Arjuna) and son (Abhimanyu), suggests to the Viräta king to send another charioteer. The king, however, has no longer any doubt about the qualities of his son as a warrior. Again, he sends away the soldier for more news. The latter returns almost imme diately, reporting that the cattle raid has been repelled successfully and that the Kauravas have been put to flight. Prince Uttara is said to be preparing a written report (pustaka) prai sing the courage of the soldiers during the fight". Brhannalä has retired to the harem to share the good news with the king's wives. The king requests the presence of Brhannalä and asks her to relate the détails of the battle, but before she can actually start a soldier enters bearing the news of the capture of Abhimanyu. The king is told that this feat has been accomplished by a servant from his own kitchen with his bare hands. This servant is Bhïma who lived disguised as a kitchen-help at the Viräta court. Bhlma enters, and next Abhimanyu is brought in. Abhimanyu, undaunted by the fact that he has been 11 drstaparispandänäm yodhapurusanäm karmäni pustakam aropayati ku mârah. | (Pr. II: 399,19f. [prose after v. 27]).</page><page sequence="6">22 H. Tieken conquered by an unarmed foot-soldier, makes a great impression on everybody by his arrogant behaviour. At this point Uttara enters. Feeiing uneasy about the undeserved glory showered on him, he reveals that the victory was actually the work of Brhannalâ and ventures the opinion that, judging by the way she handled the bow, she must be Arjuna. While Arjuna, for his part, wishes to persist in his disguise, Yudhisthira reveals his own and his two brothers' real identities as the period of thirteen years has passed. Virâta feels greatly honoured by the presence of the Pândavas at his court. Abhimanyu is reunited with his father and his uncles. Virâta, somewhat worried by possible intimacies between his daughter Uttarâ and Arjuna during the latter's stay in the harem, offers his daughter to Arjuna in marriage. By refusing this gift Arjuna wishes to make clear to the king that he did not touch his daughter. Arjuna, however, gladly accepts her as the wife for his son Abhimanyu. As the stars are auspicious the marriage should take place the same day, and Uttara is dispatched to invite the Kauravas. In the meantime Duryodhana had been informed of Abhimanyu's capture. The charioteer relates how Abhimanyu had been captured by a mere foot-soldier who had stopped the chariot using only his bare hands. Bhïsma and Drona argue that the only person they know to be capable of such a feat is BhTma. Sakuni, not illogically, accuses them of inverting the argument: if the Pândavas are strong this does not mean that ail strong men are Pândavas. Arguing thus, he goes on, someone might even say that Uttara, because he proved such a good bowman, was actually Arjuna. In fact, that is precisely what Drona and Bhïsma do next, for they had recognized the peculiar twang of Arjuna's bow. This altercation is interrupted by a charioteer bringing in the arrow which hit the standard on Bhïsma's chariot during the battle. The arrow carries the name 'Arjuna'. Sakuni still does not accept this as evidence of the identity of the Pândavas, as there could well have been other soldiers among the Virâta king's army named Arjuna. In order to exclude the possibility that the name had been written by Uttara, Sakuni demande that some specimen of the handwriting of Uttara is shown. Duryodhana, suspecting that he is being cheated, proclaims that he will only hand over his realm when he has actually seen Yudhisthira. Precisely at this point Uttara enters, informing Duryo dhana that he was sent by Yudhisthira. He passes on an invitation for the wedding of his sister Uttarâ with Abhimanyu, and inquires where the wedding should take place, at the court of Duryodhana or at that of Virâta Sakuni immediately shouts that it should take place in Virâta. Drona reminds Duryodhana that he, for his part, has fulfilled his task: news has been brought of the Pândavas within five days. He</page><page sequence="7">Three Men in a Row 23 asks Duryodhana to do as he had promised, namely to grant half the realm to his cousins, with which Duryodhana dutifully compiles. From verse I 26 it becomes clear that the ritual sacrifice (yajna) performed by Duryodhana is a räjasüya. The developments in the play indeed follow the enactment of this year-long sacrifice closely, and several incidents can be identified with particular elements of the räjasüya, such as the cattle raid carried out on chariots, the role of the king's son in the raid, the insistence on the identification of the owner of the arrow, and the term of five days (pancarätra) which gave the play its title. The play begins with the avabhrthasnäna supervised by three brah mins. The avabhrthasnäna is the culminating point of the sacrifice, and that is indeed how it is perceived by all participants, who afterwards gather to congratulate Duryodhana 'on the completion of the sacrifice'. Sakuni, however, proves to be a 'Verstehrder' by urging Duryodhana to take up his weapons again, which in effect means asking Duryodha na to start a new räjasüya. Sakuni's advice is ignored. However, where Sakuni did not succeed with proper ksatriya arguments, Drona did, however inadvertantly, with arguments of love and compassion. Drona asks Duryodhana by way of daksinä to show compassion towards his cousins the Pändavas and to give back to them half the kingdom, a request which indirectly leads to the attack upon the Viräta king. Dro na cannot help praising the Pändavas, which really infuriates Duryo dhana. Drona's praise is a challenge to his newly established supremacy, forcing him into action again, which is precisely what everybody is trying to prevent. Thus, Karna wams Drona to be more tactful in what he is saying, for he is endangering his 'pupil's work' (sisyakärya), i. e. the sacrifice, which has (almost) been completed12. On Karna's advice Dro na changes his tactics, trying not to enrage Duryodhana any further. It is clear to everybody, however, that Duryodhana has to keep his pro mise. Advised by Sakuni, however, he adds one condition, namely that within five days Drona manages to prove that the Pändavas are indeed still alive. This means, that if within these five days the Pändavas do not show up to challenge him, Duryodhana remains the sole ruler of an undivided realm. This period of five days has evidently been grafted on the ksatrasya dhrti, a five-day sacrifice, which functions as a kind of interlude between the completed räjasüya and the next one, that is, in case a competitor shows up13. The cattle raid14, which in the ritual is directed against a so-called weakened relative, is in the play directed against the Virätas, whose 12 gatam idam avasânam raksyatäm sisyakâryam (Pr. I 38c). 13 See Heesterman 1957: 12f., 220f. and 223. 14 See Heesterman 1957: 127-139.</page><page sequence="8">24 H. Tieken power is weakened by the death of their relatives, the Kïcakas. The cattle raid is, as in the ritual itself, carried out on chariots. A stränge incident takes place at the very end of the first act, when ail agree that Sakuni should drive the first chariot (prathamarathah [p. 389,3]) at the head of the army. It is not clear why this honour was reserved for Sakuni, Duryodhana's maternai uncle. In the räjasüya it is either the king who carries out the raid, mounted on a chariot with his son and heir standing behind him, or his son15. In this respect, what follows corresponds much more closely to the ritual, the battle being a war mainly between 'sons', Abhimanyu on the side of the Kauravas and Uttara on the side of the Virâtas. How ever, on both sides there is something peculiar. Abhimanyu, though treated by Duryodhana as his son"', is the Pântlava Arjuna's son. While Uttara is credited with the Virâtas' final victory, in actual fact the work is done by Brhannalâ, alias Arjuna. The recovery by Arjuna of the bow Gândïva at the beginning of the battle involved a considérable risk. However, mainly through this bow the battle was fïnally decided in favour of the Virâtas. In the räjasüya the sacrificer shoots an arrow at a ksatriya, which is to be returned to the royal sacrificer or to the king's son. In the play this scene from the ritual is echoed in a scrambled form in the efforts undertaken to establish the identity of the owner of the arrow shot at Bhïsma's standard. It should be noted that Sakuni's demand that a specimen is brought forward of Uttara's handwriting to rule out the possibility that Uttara might have written the name 'Arjuna' on the arrow, while duly anticipated earlier on, namely where Uttara is said to write a hook reporting on the courage of the soldiers (see above, p. 21), is curiously enough not followed up. At this point the development of the plot is eut short by the appearance of Uttara in person. It should be noted that at the end of the play we come across another curious twist in the plot. Duryodhana accepte Uttara's asser tion that the Pândavas are still alive, while in the immediately prece ding verse Duryodhana had explicitly stipulated that he would believe it only after he had actually 'seen' Yudhisthira17. One cannot escape from the impression that towards the end the play was rushed to its conclusion. At the end of the viskambhaka to the first act, the three brahmins, after having supervised the ritual, leave the stage to greet the king. Despite the carelessness of their pupils the ritual was apparently com pleted successfully. The three brahmins do not reappear in the act 15 See Heesterman 1957: 128 and 131. See Pr. III 4c: atha ca marna sa putrah pändavänäm tu pascät. 17 räjyasyärdham pradäsyämi y&amp;vad drste yudhisthire // (III 21cd).</page><page sequence="9">Three Men in a Row 25 proper. There, their role is taken over by the epic character Drona. The link between the three brahmins and Drona is established at the very beginning of the act, in which Drona still appears to be worrying about all the possible mistakes his pupil Duryodhana could have made during the ritual, 'for any mistake by a pupil is blamed on the teacher'18. The relationship between the three brahmins and their pupils in the viskambhaka is here transferred to the epic characters of the play proper. This means that the daksinä which Drona receives, is given to him on behalf of the three brahmins. In this connection it is important to note that the présentation of the daksinä is still part of the avabhrthasnäna, which, as we saw, was supervised by the three brahmins. Thus, just before the matter of the daksinä is raised Bhïsma tells Duryodhana to mind the avabhrthasnäna instead of listening to Sakuni's inflammatory words19. All this means that the three brah mins left the stage and joined Duryodhana for the specific purpose of collecting the daksinä due to them. The handing over of the daksinä s as part of the avabhrthasnäna takes place during the isti of breaking up from the place of the ritual. The number of persons to be presented with a daksinä is indeed specified as three, namely the brahman priest, the hotr and the adhvaryu priest, the daksinäs consisting of a piece of gold, a cow and a garment for each of them20. In Pancarätra the three persons were brahmins so that their function at the ritual was more or less obvious. In the two plays to be discussed next, Abhiseka and Ürubhariga, they are vidyädharas and soldiers respectively, that is, figures who do not have a role to play at a ritual. However, when they leave the stage it is to be near the king, who is about to be the centre of certain ritual activities, and their number agrees exactly with the number of the brahmins required at the re spective rituals. Abhiseka The play begins and ends ('happily') with an abhiseka ritual. The first abhiseka is Sugrïva's, the second Räma's. In each case, the ritual is preceded by a duel which is decided only after interférence from outside. The first duel is fought between Välin and Sugrlva, and is won 18 äcaryam ägacchati sisyadosah / (I 19b). 19 pautra duryodhana \ avabhrthasnänamätram eva khalu tävat \ mitra mukhasya satroh éakuner vacanam na srotavyam \ (I: 382,11 f.

Râma subsequently appoints SugrTva as king of the monkeys and orders his brother Laksmana to arrange for Sugrïva's abhiseka. In the final aet a duel takes place between Râma and Rävana, in which the latter is slain by Râma after having received help from Indra's charioteer Mâtali and a miraculous boomerang type of weapon from Brahma. After this Râma's abhiseka, which earlier had been postponed at Kaikeyî's request, can finally take place21. The duel between Râma and Rävana is described in the viskambhaka to the sixth act by three vidyädharas looking down from the sky. After Räma's victory, the 'first' vidyädhara suggests that they, too, will go to Râma in order to honour him22. The other two agree with the words bädham \ prathamah kalpah | (p. 364,22). In the act proper Râma, after having made Vibhlsana Lord of Lanka, enters Lankâ. Sltâ's arrivai is announced, but Râma at first refuses to see her. However, when Laksmana cornes to tell him that Sîtâ is about to enter the fire to prove her innocence, he orders his brother to prevent her from carrying out her décision. Apparently Laksmana arrived too late, but Hanümän reports that Sîtâ arose from the fire unscathed, thus establishing her purity. Next Agni enters, escorting Sîtâ and assuring Râma that he can accept her, upon which Râma says that he had been convinced of Sltâ's purity from the beginning but had to convince the world of it as well. Next Agni invites Râma to step behind the curtain for his abhiseka. After this Râma re-enters the stage, where his brother Laksmana, his people and his two other brothers Bharata and Satrughna stand in attendance to congratulate him. After this the play ends abruptly with the bharatavâkya. As noted above, at the end of the avabhrtha, which itself concludes the abhiseka, daksinâs are to be given to three persons, the brahman priest, the hoir and the adhvaryu priest, as a reward for their presence during the preceding cérémonies. After the duel the three vidyädharas leave the stage to présent themselves before Râma, who is about to be consecrated. It does not seem too far-fetched to assume that the three vidyädharas of the viskambhaka represent the three brahmins. This would account for their number, not, however, for their ap pearance as vidyädharas, or, as we will see next in Ürubhanga, as 21 See Abh. VI 34 (p. 369): yenäham krtamangalapratisaro bhadräsanäropi to 'py, ambäyäh priyam icchatä nrpatinä bhinnäbhisekah krtah / vyaktam daiva gatim gatena gurunä pratyaksatah sämpratam, tenaivädya punah prahrsta manasä präptäbhisekah krtah //.

At this point I merely wish to note that in this play the dividing line between the world of men and the supranatural world of gods is a thin one. For instance, in the fourth act the God Varuna appears in person, frightened by the heavenly weapon thrown by Räma at the sea. Varuna mistakes Râma for Näräyana23. The same 'mistake' is made by Agni in the sixth act24. In his duel against Rävana Räma receives help from Indra, who sends his charioteer Mätali. After Räraa's victory musical instruments resound and a shower of flowers descends from the sky. The victory itself is hailed as the work of the gods25. Düring the abhiseka Räma is said to be surroun ded by Yama, Varuna, Kubera, Indra and the other gods26. And, finally, his brothers and the people honour him as ordered by Indra27. Ürubhanga A récurrent topic in the discussions of Ürubhanga is the présenta tion on stage of Duryodhana's death, which would violate the rules of dramaturgy.28 Another question raised, which is related to this death, is what constitutes the dominant rasa of the play, or rather whether or not Ürubhanga might be considered a tragedy29. A third feature which has drawn scholars' attention is the exceptional length of the vi skambhaka, or prelude, and the fact that the play dérivés its title 'The breaking of the Thighs' from an incidence which is described only in the prelude, not in the play itself'0. In the following discussion I will have little to contribute to these issues except for the second point. As far as I see it, the question of the dominant rasa of the play or whether or not it is a tragedy in the western sense of the word, misses the aim of the dying Duryodhana's last words. 23 See Abh. IV 13f. (with prose [p. 350f.]). 24 See the prose after v. 26 (p. 367,13ff.). Note, however, that in VI 12 (p. 363) Räma standing on the chariot is compared to Siva (kapardï [12d]) rushing out to destroy the Three Cities, whereas in verse III 16 (p. 343) Siva is depicted as a lesser god, Hanömän telling Rävana that he will not escape his death even if he takes recourse with Sankara. 25 See Abh.

Τικκκχ In the prelude three soldiers belonging to the Kaurava side descri be the appearanee of the battlefield Sämantapancaka where the battle took place between the Pändavas and Kauravas. It is strewn with corpses hacked to pièces. Women are trying to rescue the dead bodies from the jaws of preying jackals. Heroes look splendid even while lying with their eyes fixed on the sky above. Attracted by a sound, the soldiers arrive on the scene of the personal confrontation of Bhïma and Duryodhana. They join the spectators from both the Pändava and Kaurava side, and describe how Bhïma, instructed by Krsna, treache rously throws his mace at üuryodhana's thighs. Bhlma, realizing his unheroic behaviour from Baladeva's disgusted reaction, is led away from the scene by his brothers and Krsna. Next, the second soldier suggests that they départ to be near their king who is dying:!l. The two others agree with the words bädham \ prathamah kalpah \ (p. 496,6). In what follows several persons approach the dying Duryodhana, whose main concern seems to be to dissuade those around him from taking revenge on the Pändavas. In this he fails in the case of Asvatthäman, who swears to make a nightly attack on the Pändavas in order to annihilate them. As the oath has been made in the presence of a witness, it is deemed useless to try to change Asvatthäman's mind. Subsequently Duryodhana dies and goes to heaven. Dhr tarästra leaves for a penance grove, his life having become meaningless by the loss of his sons. Asvatthäman départs to wreak havoc on the Pändavas. In the play proper no ritual takes place, not even those rites performed in order to avert death or to ease the passage of the dying man's soul (for which, see Caland 1896: 5-11). On the other hand, Duryodhana's death, with which the play ends, signais the beginning of rites for the 'fathers' (sräddha). The protagoniste themselves more than once mention the rite of 'laying down' the pindas for the pitrs (niväpa or nivapana). For instance, the dying Duryodhana anticipâtes his own niväpa, desiring that 'the clouds [raining] niväpa for the Kuru family may live (forever)'32. Blind Dhrtarästra curses his fate at being unable to see his son. He wishes to be assured of the fact that after his death he may just once 'eat' the pinda laid down by a son, Duryodha na being the last son to have survived the battle33. Duryodhana asks his son Durjaya to give him water together with the Pändavas during the rite of which the last part consists of mentioning the father's 31 tad ägamyatäm vayam api tävan mahäräjasya pratyantanbhavämah \ (Übh. 496,5 [prose after v. 26]). 32 jîvantu te kurukulasya niväpameghäh (91c [p. 497]). 33 dharanitalavikîrnam kim sa yogyo na bhoktum, sakrd api dhrtarästrah putradattam niväpam // (39cd [p. 499]).</page><page sequence="13">Three Men in a Row 29 name34. Finally, Asvatthäman blâmes himself for his inability to pre vent the treacherous killing of Duryodhana, which took place while he himself was busy with preparing the pinda for his father Drona35. It should be noted that Asvatthäman, like everybody eise, jumps from his father's death straight to the nivapana, skipping in his mind all intervening rites. If the main concern of the dying Duryodhana is indeed 'his' niväpa after his death, a concern which is duplicated by his father Dhr tarästra and by Asvatthäman, the same concern might be ascribed to the three soldiers when they leave the stage in order to be near their king Duryodhana. In their number one may then recognize the num ber of the brahmins who at the nivapanajvâpa represent the three pitrs. Another concern of the dying Duryodhana is reconciliation with, and forgiveness towards, his enemies the Pändavas, who have so treacherously killed him. When Baladeva, from the Pändava side, dismayed at Bhlma's unheroic behaviour, offers to hand over the Pändavas to the Kauravas, Duryodhana tries to appease him. Bhïma would merely have fullfilled a vow36. He urges his son to unite with the Pändavas at the rites for the dead (see above). Finally, Duryodhana tries to appease Asvatthäman but is overtaken by the latter's rash ness. Gerow (1985) has already noted that this development in volves a significant déviation from the epic story. For one thing, in the epic the family members (Dhrtarästra, mother, wife and son) are absent. More importantly, instead of Duryodhana's insistence on forgive ness, we find long harangues between him and the Pändavas. In Ürubhanga the Pändavas have left the stage immediately after the 34 dey am pändavasutais tvayâ mama samam nämävasäne jalam // (53d [p. 505]). The description seems to apply to the ρindapiIryajna (érauta). Düring this sacrifice the yajamäna lays down the pindas in grooves in which earlier he had poured water. While doing so, he addresses his father, grandfather and great-grandfather with the words: 'This is for you, Ν. N., and for those who come after you' (see Hillebrandt 1897: 115 [§ 63] and Caland 1893: 6). Note, however, that this is not the only occasion when water is poured while addressing a dead man by his name. For instance, during the purification after (or before) the crémation, a handful of water is spent for the deceased (udakakarman) who is addressed hy his name, or, according to another source, by his personal as well as his gotra name (see Hillebrandt 1897: 89 [§ 56,2] and Caland 1896: 76-79); the same after the crémation, when the house of the deceased is purified (äsauca). The deceased is given a pinda and water is poured 'for him to wash himself with', while he is called by his name (see Hillebrandt ib. [§ 56,3] and Caland 1896: 79-81). 35 mayi gurunivapanavyagre vancitah kila kurukulatilakabhütah kururäjah | (p. 506,4f.

Gerovv interprets these déviations as the resuit of an attempt on the part of the playwright to create the conditions for karuna as the dominant rasa of the play. As far as I can see, however, the peculiar development in the play, which. it should be noted, is not restricted to Ûrubhanga but is also found in Abhiseka in the person of Vâlin (see above, n. 28), was determined by quite a différent concern, namely to take away the fear of what might happen if an angry and spiteful dead person would join the pitrs. A reflex of this fear is found in the description in Mânava Dharmasâstra III 192 of the pitrs as akrodhana and nyastaéastra. The latter eharacteristic, nyastasastra, would show that the fear was particularly strong in the case of a ksatriya. In the plays discussed above the appearance of the three men is restricted to the viskambhaka, or préludé; in the act proper the epic characters take over. Their function is in line with the nature of the viskambhaka, which is to provide an introduction to the following act. As eye-witnesses they describe the incidents which took place imme diately before, but which by their nature (battle, sacrifice) cannot be performed on stage. In Pancarâtra three brahmins describe the ava bhrthasnäna of Duryodhana's râjasûya, the actual performance of which is carried out by their pupils. At one point they actually inter fère, namely when the fire escapes. When they retire from the scene it is. as argued above, to collect their daksinä. In the play itself their rôle is taken over by one person, namely Drona, who indeed receives a daksinâ. This shows that as to the nature of the characters we should maintain a clear distinction between the play proper and the vi skambhaka. In the act proper mainly well-known or 'historical' char acters from the epic appear, while in the viskambhaka there are only by-standers, whose nature is the playwright's own invention or choice. Whether they are brahmins, soldiers or vidyâdharas, in each individual case their number, which is otherwise unusual, can be explained with reference to the number of brahmins required at the ritual performed in or anticipated by the play. M a d h y a m a Madhyama is an exception to the pattern met with in the three other plays in that the three 'brahmins' belong to the main characters of the play itself. Moreover, the play is not concerned with a srauta ritual but with a grhya samskâra. On the other hand, this short play, which seems to dérivé its tension from the obligation of brahmins, once invited to a ritual, to show up in füll number (see below), makes</page><page sequence="15">Three Men in a Row 31 explicit why the 'brahmins' in the three other plays feit it their duty to go to their king. It also shows that the three 'brahmins' were a stock set, a group of four being made up of three plus one. The plot of this short one-act play is, at least at first sight, simple and straightforward. A brahmin family, consisting of father, mother, and their three sons, is on its way to attend the upanayana ceremony of a relative's son. Halfway they are stopped by Ghatotkaca who has been ordered by his mother Hidimbä to find a human being for her to eat. The brahmin realizes that calling for help is useless. Though the Pändavas' retreat is nearby, these kings have left for Dhaumya's satakumbha (?) sacrifice. Bhïma has stayed behind to guard the âéra ma, but is training somewhere far off. However, Ghatotkaca is prepared to let the family go if they hand over one son to him. If they do not comply, all will perish. The father proposes to go instead, but his wife objects on the ground that she is dépendent on him. The offer of the mother to sacrifice herseif is decli ned, as Hidimbä had specified that she wanted a male human being. Next, the father does not want to part with the eldest son, and the mother not with the youngest one. The middle one, feeling unloved, accepte his fate. He says goodbye to his father, who predicts that he will reach brahmaloka, to his mother, who (with unintended irony) wishes him a long life, and to his two brothers. After having promised that he will go with Ghatotkaca, the boy asks one last favour, namely to be allowed to have a drink of water from a nearby pond, as water will not be available in brahmaloka. Ghatotkaca grants him this wish, but urges the boy to hurry as otherwise the time for eating might pass for Hidimbä. Becoming impatient Ghatotkaca teils the brahmin to call his son. The father refuses. He also refuses to divulge the boy's name. Taking his eue from the eldest son who commiserates with his 'middle' brother, Ghatotkaca tries calling madhyama. This is overheard by Bhïma, the 'middle one' of the five Panda va brothers. He goes to investigate who is calling. Upon seeing Ghatotkaca Bhïma is impressed by the youth's appearance and feels attracted to him as if he were a relative. In fact, Ghatotkaca is his very own son by Hidimbä. However, while in their subséquent altercation each makes ambiguous remarks concerning a father-son relationship they remain unaware of the true nature of their familial bond almost until the very end of the play. After Bhïma had introduced himself as the 'middle' brother of the Pändavas, the second son returns, refreshed from drinking the water. Ghatotkaca wants to leave with the boy immediately. The father, however, begs Bhïma to rescue him. Only at this point are we informed of the identity of the old brahmin and the purpose of his j ourney. When Bhïma hears of Ghatotkaca's intention, he offers to go himself</page><page sequence="16">32 Η. ΤικκκΝ instead of the brahmin boy. Only in the second instance does he add that in that case Ghatotkaca will have to take him by force. A fïght ensues in which various types of weapons are used, but each time Bhïma manages to free himself. Finally, Ghatotkaca reminds Bhîma of his first offer and asks him to honour his pledge to come himself instead of the brahmin boy. After this Bhïma accompanies Ghatotka ca to the latter's mother. When Hidimbä sees whom her son has brought for her meal, she is agreeably surprised and introduces Gha totkaca to his father. Bhïma embraces his son. After Ghatotkaca, urged by his newly found father, has saluted the old brahmin, the latter expresses his desire to go on now that his own family and that of Bhïma have been saved37. Bhïma ackowledges that everything has ended well thanks to the brahmin, and offers him hospitality in his âsrama. The brahmin déclinés the offer, saying that by saving his life Bhïma has already shown suffïcient 'hospitality' (ätithya [p. 438,8]). The brahmin clearly prefers to leave immediately. Bhïma agréés to that, not without expressing the desire to see the brahmin again. The latter then takes leave with the words bâdham prathamah kalpah | (p. 438,10). Bhïma, reunited with his wife and son, escorts the brahmin's family up to the entrance of the âsrama, after which the play ends with the customary bharatavâkya. The play is concerned with the upanayana ceremony on more than one level. On one level we have the brahmin family on its way to attend a relative's son's initiation. On another level we have the task set for Ghatotkaca by his mother, which is reminiscent of the test set by the guru (or his wife) for his pupil as part of the latter's initiation.38 After the successful completion of his task Ghatotkaca is reunited with his father and mother, which duplicates the return of the snâtaka to his family. It may be asked if the sacrifice of the middle son of the brahmin should not be considered such a test as well. In the play itself it is made clear that the success of the ceremony dépends on the presence of brahmins. Note in this connection that Bhïma attributes his happy reunion with his son and wife entirely to the brahmin39, which of course includes his three sons. Arguing back wards from the 'happy ending', it appears that the dramatic tension of the play is formed by the fear that the brahmin family would not be able to show up in its entirety at their relative's son's upanayana. As 37 raksitam asmatkulam svakularn uddhrtam ca | gacchämax tävat \ (Ma. 438,3 [prose after ν. 50]). 38 For other examples of tasks set by the guru s wife for her husband's pupil, see Wilhelm 1965. 39 anugrahät tu bhavatah sarvam âsîd idam subham / (51ab [p. 438J).</page><page sequence="17">Three Men in a Row 33 such the play exemplifies the anxiety resulting from the obligation implied by the expression prathamah kalpah40. The number of brahmins is only rarely specified for the samskäras individually. Apart from the général rule that 'at all (samskäras), garbhädhäna etc. ten brahmins should be fed'41, for the upanayana their number is specified by one authority only, namely Hiranyakesin, who stipulâtes that the number should be even42. In Madhyama this even number is made up by three plus one. In this group the set of three seems to form an independent unity as would appear from the fact that the 'réduction' is carried out on the three sons. This would show that the three 'brahmins' already constituted a stock set of characters. The Date and Place of Origin of the Trivandrum Plays It has already been indicated that by their plots, which are mainly concerned with the effectiveness of the ritual, the four plays discussed above - and, similarly, Pratimä - stand completely apart from the mainstream of classical Sanskrit drama.43 The main concern of the known classical plays is the expansion of the realm or the becoming a cakravartin. The means through which these aims, which to a large extent overlap, are effected is marriage, not ritual. The plot revolves around the king acquiring an additional wife (nätikä) or the future cakravartin trying to retrieve his kidnapped wife (MälatTmädhava, Nä gänanda offering a variant in which the future cakravartin was kidnap ped himself). If the Trivandrum plays are indeed the work of Kälidäsa's predecessor Bhäsa, the particular concern of drama with ritual would have to be traced back to the very beginnings of Sanskrit drama. 40 It should be noted that it is not certain whether with the words pratha mah kalpah the brahmin indeed refers to his obligation to turn up at his relative's son's initiation or reacts to Bhlma's invitation to return: 'You go now with your family, and I hope to see you again' (gacchatu bhavän sakutum bah punardarsanäya | [438,9 (prose aft-er v. 51)]). 41 garbhädhänädisarvesu brähmanän bhojayed dasa /, a half-verse which Aparärka attributes to a certain Kätyäyana, as quoted by Kane (1941: 212n. 493), who notes (p. 212): "Just as homa is required in most grhya rites there are certain matters common to almost all rites. One is that in all samskäras one has to feed brähmanas learned in the Vedas". 42 See Hillebrandt 1897: 51, referring to Hiranyakesi Grhyasütra I 1,6 (yugmän brähmanän annena parivisya). 43 The finding that the plot of, for instance, Pr. was grafted on a specific sacrifice is not to be confounded with the conclusion that drama itself was in its origin a ritual (see KuiPER 1979: e. g. 128).</page><page sequence="18">34 H. Tieken However, as to the so-called 'Bhäsa'-theory, which ascribes the thirteen anonymous Trivandrum plays collectively to Bhäsa, it should be noted that quite recently considérable evidence was brought to light which suggests that the Trivandrum plays are part of a relatively late South Indian tradition of drama writing. Thus, I have shown that Pratijnäyaugandharäyana as we now have it44 is a recast composed in South India after the sixth Century45. The kinship System found in Avimäraka has been characterized by Tkautmann (1974) as typically Dravidian,40 while Couture (1994) has advanced evidence which shows that Bälacarita is a Southern play written late in the second half of the first millennium. Additional evidence for this conclusion may be derived from the anthropomorphic représentation of Krsna's weapons in Bälacarita and Dütaväkya47. As a resuit, there is now only a single play among the Trivandrum plays which can indeed be traced to Bhäsa, namely Svapnaväsavadatta, though the form in which we now have it is a recast (see Tieken 1993: 29ff.). Cärudatta is a recast as 44 The condition 'as we now have it' is essential if only to avoid a misun derstanding such as found with Brückner (1995: 36n. 6), when objecting to my conclusions (Tieken 1993) regarding the indebtedness of the Mantrâiika of Pratijnäyaugandharäyana to Mattavilâsa on the ground that the Man trânka might be a later addition (with référencé to Zin-Oczkowska 1990). BrüCKNEr's other points of criticism have been formulated too summarily for me to be able to go into them here. As to her final comment, concerning the ehronological problème resulting from my dating of Pratijnäyaugandharäya na, this of course is in itself no argument against my conclusions. 45 See Tieken 1993. In η. 22 on p. 15 of this article 1 discussed the ex pression pratihastiprotsähana occurring in Mahendravarman's Mattavilâsa as well as Dandin's Dasakumâracarita. It has subsequently corne to my notice that the same expression occurs in Kautilya's Arthasâstra as well, namely in 1 14. 7 (ed. R. P. Kangle): sakyam a,iya pratihastiprotsäharienäpakartum. If as seems almost certain - Dandin borrowed the expression from Arthasâstra, and if Mahendravarman borrowed the term from Dandin, this would mean that Dandin lived before the latter king, i. e. before the beginning of the seventh Century. 4,1 Trautmann (1974: 71) also notes that this "ought to be taken into account in the continuing debate over the ascription of this and its accompa nying plays to Bhâsa". — As far as 1 can see cekrîdyatâm in III 18d (p. 143) does not prove, contrary to what was suggested by Β H AT (1975: 187), that Avimäraka was written before Nâtyasâstra, in which treatise the word is condemned as ungraceful. In this connection it should be noted that the speaker, Avimäraka himself, admits being highly confused; see matis c,a mû dhâ suciräbhiläsät in the same verse (III 18b). The introduction of a word condemned by Nâtyasâstra evidently served as a sign of the speaker's confu sion. If my interprétation is correct, Avimäraka was most probably written after Nâtyasâstra. 47 See Couture 1994: 121f. (in particular n. 20) and Hardy 1983: 79n. 102.</page><page sequence="19">Three Men in a Row 35 well48. The many common features shared by the Trivandrum plays, collected by Sukthankar (1923), which have been advanced in sup port of the attribution of the plays to one author, could equally well be explained as the trademarks of a particular tradition of playwriting. This tradition would have to be set in South India after the seventh Century, which explains the occurrence of identical features in plays actually composed in South India, such as Saktibhadra's Äscäryacü dämani and Kulasekharavarman's plays, which have been discovered subsequently. With regard to the so-called archaisms found in the Prakrit of the plays, it should be noted that these do not automatically point to an early date of the plays. For one thing, the same archaisms are found in other, later, South Indian plays as well, such as Äscäryacüdämani and the plays by Kulasekharavarman. As I have argued elsewhere49, the Prakrit of the South Indian plays continues a transitional stage which started some time after Asvaghosa but was completed probably only as late as Räjasekhara (9th Century). The Prakrit in the modern éditions of Kälidäsa's plays would not reflect the dialect used by this author but is the product of an unconscious process of adaptation to the standard of Mähärästrl Prakrit followed by a process of normaliza tion taking place in the course of the transmission of the texts. As already indicated with regard to Svapnaväsavadatta, the South has, however, preserved at least one play which is old in the sense that the original on which it was based antedates Kälidäsa. The question then is if this might be the case with the plays discussed above as well. Given the fact that we may have to do with late adaptations, nothing can be proved or disproved in this matter on the basis of the présent plays. If, instead, we stick to the facts, the following points may be noted: (1) The plays are apparently found only in South India and no quota tions from, or references to the plays have been found in works on dramaturgy or poetics (with the exception of Svapnaväsavadatta; see, however, above). (2) The first references to any of the Trivandrum plays are found in Natankusa and (Abhijnäna-)Säkuntalacarcä, two late works from South India50. Apart from this, there is no positive evidence either of the earlier existence of other plays with this particular type of plot. It is a well known fact that Nätyasästra was primarily concerned with the nätalca 48 See in particular Buitenen 1963. 49 In my forthcoming study 'Saurasenî, MähärästrI, and PaisäcT'. 5,1 See Tieken 1993: 6, esp. n. 4.</page><page sequence="20">36 H. Tieken and prakarana types of play, the other types being defined as variants of the nâtaka and prakarana. The définitions of these subtypes do not allow us to assume the existence of a drama tradition concerned with ritual. If the tradition, exemplified in, among other plays, Pancarätra and Madhyama, was known to them at ail, the authors of Nâtyasâs tra do not explicitly mention it.51 This silence might be explained in various ways, for instance, by assuming that the respective types of plays, which served différent purposes, were from the very beginning strictly kept apart. Only in the South would the two traditions some how have corne to be combined. For argumentas sake, it might even be assumed that Nâtyasâstra, for instance in forbidding death on stage, defined the nâtaka in opposition to the plays in question, in which death is indeed enacted on stage. Even so, the enactment of death on stage is not peculiar to the Trivandrum plays, but is also found in Nägänanda. Also, leaving aside the impact of such prohibitions, it is virtually impossible to point to specific sources on which they might have been based. A case in point is the prohibition to use, or rather the advice to avoid, the âryâ metre52, which is actually quite common in classical plays, starting with one instance in Asvaghosa's plays (see Lüders 1911: 29). All in all, there is no conclusive evidence that the plays investiga ted represent, directly or indirectly as recasts, an old, authentic tradi tion existing side by side to the plays by Asvaghosa or Kälidäsa. For all we know they are the products of a relatively recent, regional tradition in South India. In fact, the concern with ritual in the plays, which is an innovation in the tradition of Sanskrit drama, might give us some idea about the factors involved in the préservation of the art of writing of Sanskrit plays in South India. It would seem that the brahmins had managed to find a new context for Sanskrit plays, namely the performance of a ritual53. The Standard occasion mentioned in the texts themselves for the performance of a classical Sanskrit play is some seasonal festival, 51 Ns. XXVII 38 does mention the appearance on stage of items used in ritual or sacrifice, such as the sacrificial post (yüpa) and the saerificial fire (iagnicayana); see Bhat 1975: 259-261. Probably, however, what Ns. refers to here are items found in an äsrama. It should be noted that a ritual or sacrifice cannot have been performed on stage as part of a play for the simple reason that its action could not be shortened and no parts of it could be skipped. 52 See Ns XV 193ff. An exception is made for the use of the äryä metre in 'songs' (gîtake [194b]). 53 The ritual concern found in the plays would belie Weller's conclusion (quoted from Hardy 1983: 80n. 107) that the milieu in which the Trivandrum plays originated would have betrayed little brahmin influence.</page><page sequence="21">Three Men in a Row 37 utsava or yäträ,54 As such the plays continue the tradition laid down in Nâtyasâstra according to which the fïrst mythical performance of a Sanskrit play took place during a festival dedicated to Indra (see Kuiper 1979). The 'deity' of the festival was invoked in the nändv'5. In Pratimä, however, a clear reference is found to the performance of a play at the abhiseka. In the first act of the play in the course of the préparations of Räma's abhiseka a servant is dispatched to the 'con cert-hall' (sangidasälä) to warn the actresses to be ready for a perfor mance appropriate for the occasion56. The costumes required for the play include an ascetic's dress made of bark (vakkala [skt. valkala]), which has been stolen by a servant and put on for fun by Sita, who in doing so anticipâtes her fate subsequently depicted in the play. The play 'appropriate' for the occasion is thus no other than Pratimä itself. In South India even now a play may be performed as part of the sräddha. De Bruin (1994: 227f.) reports performances of Tamil plays with titles such as "Karna's Death" and "Vâlin's Death" by groups of Kattaikküttu (alias Terukküttu) actors at funeral ceremonies (karu mäntaram) in present-day Tamil Nadu households57. It is tempting to imagine that Ürubhanga was performed at such a ceremony in South Indian households. This at least would account for the setting of the scene in the play within the family and the stress on family values58. While some sacriflcial rites included story-telling (asvamedha), or dan cing, singing and music,59 there seems, however, to be no evidence of performances of Sanskrit plays at rituals earlier than the plays discus sed above.60 If Ürubhanga was indeed performed at the sräddha, this 54 See also Kuiper (1979: 241), who refers to Kämasütra, which mentions "plays (preksanaka) which the näyaka, who here acts as the head of the nägaralcas, organizes, as part of a procession (ghatä), in the temple of Saras vatl (1.4.14-18)". Kuiper concludes that this description "shows that perfor mances, sponsored by rieh Citizens, did take place, on the occasion of religious festivals which were also social events, but in temples instead of theaters". Kuiper (1979: 126) also quotes a passage from Ns. (IV 271c-273b) which mentions dance performances (nrtta) "on the occasion of marriage, child birth, réception of a son-in-law, joyous religious festivals, etc.". However, it is far from certain whether what is said of dancing is indeed also true of dramatic performances. On the term nrtta and its relationship to nätya, see Bansat-Boudon 1994. 55 See Ns.

By the same reasoning Madhyama may have been performed at an upana yana ceremony. The date post quem for this innovation is furnished by the reign of the Pallava King Mahendravarman (610-630 A. D.), who seems to have introduced Sanskrit drama into South India, or, at least, was personally involved in composing Sanskrit plays. The play written by this king himself, the prahasana Mattaviläsa, and the plays mentioned in contemporary inscriptions, Bhagavadajjuka and Vikramorvaslya (see Tieken 1993: 34), however, do not show a particular concern with ritual. If anything, Mahendravarman seems to have been primarily interested in the possibilities offered by the variety of types of plays. This interest, which remained a characteristic feature of South Indian Kävya literature throughout its history, explains the inclusion in the South Indian repertory of such plays as Svapnaväsavadatta, Cärudat ta and Pratijnäyaugandharäyana, to mention only the Trivandrum plays. It is not clear at what type of occasions the latter plays were performed. Within the South Indian repertory the 'ritual' plays seem to be the products of the subséquent discovery of a new area in which Sanskrit authors (brahmins?) could display their skills and art. Above I have already briefly referred to a living tradition of drama performances in Tamil Nadu. The plays concerned are in Tamil, and the thèmes are mostly based on the epics. The performances take place mainly at festivals but also at private homes on the occasion of a funeral ceremony. As such the Tamil tradition has the same functions once fulfilled by Sanskrit drama.61 It is tempting to look for possible traces of mutual influence in the respective traditions. In connection with the three 'brahmins', which as Madhyama shows form a fixed set, I would like to draw attention to the so-called kônankis, characters common to various types of theatre in South India. The kônankis feature mainly in the preliminaries and as such do not belong to the characters of the play proper. In the particular performance witnessed by De Bruin the preliminaries consisted of a musical introduction, followed by the entrances of three burlesque characters performing various dance steps. They were referred to as perumâl kônankis and were said to represent the monkey devotees of Râma. The kônanki scene (called perumâl kônanki âttam) was followed by the worship of place during a sacrifice (yajna). However, the particular verse is part of a passage which would be a later (after 1050 A. D.) interpolation. 61 Whether this was also the case with Kfltiyâttam, the repertory of which consisted of, among other plays, the Trivandrum plays, is difficult to judge. The available information concerning this tradition is highly coloured by the recent revival of Kfltiyâttam as part of the Kerala héritage'.</page><page sequence="23">Three Men in a Row 39 Ganesa, after which a figure appeared on stage whose function much resembled that of the sütradhära in Sanskrit drama (De Bruin 1994: 172-174). The elements of the preliminary scene (könankis, Ganesa, sütradhära) are apparantly more or less standard. De Bruin (1994: 164-168) notes a variant, in which first two child actors (pälar vësham) appear on stage, next the sütradhära, followed by the invocation of the gods, including Ganesa. The two child actors, who represent Krsna and Bälaräma, are also known from Yaksagäna from Karnätaka, where they are called bälagopälas. Ashton (1977: 8) describes a preli minary scene from a Yaksagäna performance in which the variant with könankis (or kodangis) was combined with that with the bälagopä las·. first two kodangis appear, then two bälagopälas, and the scene is followed by the worshipping of Ganesa. In this case the number of kodangis seems to have been determined by the number of actors required for the roles of the bälagopälas. Usually a Yaksagäna acting troupe included two young apprentices, who performed the roles of the kodangis in anticipation of a vacancy for those of the bälagopälas (see Ashton 1977: 48). In any case, it is a well-known fact that, having problems finding aspirant players in général, such groups try to keep the number of actors to a minimum for economic reasons. The fact that Yaksagäna has only two kodangis does therefore not rule out that the ideal number is indeed three. If so, I think we are justified in suggesting a possible relationship, historical or otherwise, between the three 'brahmins' in the Trivandrum plays and the three könankis in these regional theatre traditions, which, in any case, are certainly less far removed from the Sanskrit tradition than the désignation 'folk tradition' or 'street theatre' might suggest. prathamah kalpah For most rituals the number of brahmins required was specified exactly. However, as the brahmins had to be fed and given daksinäs, it was their number which determined to a large extent the costs of the ritual. In practice therefore the numbers, which were specified as only a minimum, at the same time constituted the ideal situation. The expression used in this connection in, for instance, Mânava Dharma sâstra, is prathamah kalpah 'first class' against anukalpah 'second best' in case the sacrificer was not able to comply with the minimal require ments. As we have seen, the first of these two expressions, prathamah kalpah, is used by the brahmins in order to express their agreement to the suggestion that they join the other participants of the ritual. This use is close to that found in texts dealing with ritual. At the same time, however, prathamah kalpah has already been part of the dramatic</page><page sequence="24">40 H. Tieren repertory from Asvaghosa onwards. As I will try to show, the expres sion seems to have been borrowed by these early playwrights directly from the ritual specialists. It subsequently developed in the plays into a standard formula with which the speaker expresses his agreement to a suggestion. The instances in the Trivandrum plays are on final analysis to be interpreted as a specialized use of this later development rather than as constituting an old and original use through which the expression would have found its way into the dramatic repertory. Before discussing the use of prathamah kalpah in the plays, however, some of its instances as a ritual term in Mânava Dharmasâstra and Mahâbhârata will be dealt with. As indicated above, prathamah kalpah is a kind of password cover ing ail those aspects which make up the minimal requirements of a ritual or sacrifice. One of these requirements concerns the number of brahmins to be fed at the ritual. Note in this connection Mânava Dharmasâstra III 145-147 dealing with the srâddha: yatnena bhojayec chräddhe bahvrcam vedapâragam / éâkhântagam athâdhvaryum chandogam va, samäptikam //145// esâm anyatamo yasya bhunjîta srâddham arcitah / pitfnâm tasya trptih syâc châévatî sâptapaurusî //146// esa vai prathamah kalpah pradäne havyakavyayoh, / anukalpas tv ayam jneyah sadâ sadbhir anusthitah //147// "145.

"146. If one of these three dines, duly honoured, at a funeral sacrifice, the ancestors of him (who gives the feast), as far as the seventh person, will be satisfied for a very long time. "147. This is the chief rule (to be followed) in offering sacifices to the gods and mânes; know that the virtuous always observe the following subsidiary rule." (Bühler 1886: 102). In III 187 the number of brahmins required at a srâddha is fixed at minimally three: pûrvedyur aparedyur va srâddhakarmany upasthite / nimantrayîta tryavarän samyag viprän yathoditân // "On the day before the Nrâddha-rite is performed, or on the day when it takes place, let him invite with due respect at least three Brâhmawas, such as have been mentioned above" (Bühler 1886: 110). The reference here is obviously to III 145 (see above).</page><page sequence="25">Three Men in a Row 41 As becomes clear from III 190, the obligation is mutual. Once invited, the brahmins have to turn up on pain of being reborn a swine: ketitas tu yathänyäyam havyakavye dvijottamah / katham cid apy atikräman päpah sükaratäm vrajet // "But a Brâhmawa who, being duly invited to a rite in honour of the gods or of the manes, in any way breaks (the appointment), becomes guilty (of a crime), and (in his next birth) a hog" (Bühler 1886: 111). Another use of prathamah kalpah refers to the type of son who should ideally perform the sräddha. The ritual rule is embedded in a discussion on inheritance, the passage classifying the différent types of sons in accordance with their rights to the inheritance. The first in the list is the aurasa type of son, who inherits before all other sons. The aurasa son is said to be prâthamakalpika (IX 166): sve ksetre samskrtä yäm tu svayarn utpädayed dhi yam / tarn aurasam vijânïyât putram prä thamakalpikam // "Him whom a man begets on his own wedded wife, let him know to be a legitimate son of the body (Aurasa), the first in rank" (Bühler 1886: 361). From what follows it appears, however, that the characterization prâ thamakalpika not only refers to the son's right to the inheritance, but also to his function in connection with ritual. For after the définitions of the eleven other types of sons, beginning with ksetraja, IX 180 reads: ksetrajädm sutän etän ekädasa yathoditän / putrapratinidhîn ähuh kriyälo pän manïsinah // "These eleven, the son begotten on the wife and the rest as enumerated (above), the wise call Substitutes for a son, (taken) in order (to prevent) a failure of the (funeral) ceremonies" (Bühler 1886: 364). prathamah kalpah implies that the sräddha is in principle to be per formed by the aurasa son. Only if he is not available, one of the other sons may take over the responsibilities - the term used is pratinidhi-, first the ksetraja, and if he is not available either, the one following next. In this there is no free choice, as is made clear in XI 28-30: äpatkalpena yo dharmam kurute 'näpadi dvijah / sa nâpnoti phalam tasya paratreti vicäritam // 28// visvais ca devaih sädhyais ca brähmanais ca maharsibhih / äpatsu maranäd bhttair vidheh pratinidhih krtah // 29// prabhuh prathamakalpasya yo 'nukalpena vartate / na sämparäyikam tasya durmater vidyate phalam // 30// "28.

Tieken "30. That evil-minded man, who, being able (to fulfd) the original law, lives according to the secondary rule, reaps no reward for that after death." (Bühler 1886: 435f.). The very same opposition between prathamah kalpah and prati nidhi is found in Mahäbhärata (Poona-ed.)

In XIII 87,5-7, a passage dealing with the daily (grhya) perfor mance of the érâddha, prathamah kalpah is again used with reference to the 'contract: between the sacrificer/host and the brahmins/guests, which in this case results in the obligation of the latter to eat méat"3: pitfn püjyäditah pascâd devân samtarpayanti vai / tasmât sarvaprayatnena purusah pûjayet sadâ //5// anvähäryam maharaja pitfnäm srâddham ucyate / tac cämisena vidhinä vidhih prathamakalpitahM //6// sarvesv ahahsu prîyante krtaih srâddhaih pitâmahâh / "2 Note the variants präthama0 and °kalpitah (cf. η. 64). s:' Compare Mänava Dharmasästra V 35 (niyuktas tu yathänyäyam yo mämsam nätti mânavah \ sa pretya pasutäm yäti sambhavän ekavimsatim //) and Alsdorf 1962: 26.

In these instances66 prathamah kalpah dénotés the least a performer of a ritual should do, or, more positively, the thing he should do before all other things. As an adjective, prâihamakalpika dénotés the right per son, or the first among a number of persons, to perform the ritual. Only in case of äpad may he nominate a Substitute (pratinidhi). As we can see, it was in particular used in connection with the obligation of the performer of a ritual to invite brahmins, to feed them and présent them with daksinäs, and, mutatis mutandis, with the obligation of the brahmins to show up at the sacrifice. The phrase prathamah kalpah is also found in plays. I venture to suggest that prathamah kalpah in plays has been borrowed from texts on ritual. For the reconstruction of the beginning of its career as a 'dramatic' expression there seem in theory to be two scénarios, depen ding on whether one starts from the instances in a play like Abhiseka or from those in the plays by Asvaghosa, etc. As already indicated, in Abhiseka, Ürubhanga and Madhyama prathamah kalpah, or rather bädham, prathamah kalpah, is used by 'brahmins' in order to agree to the suggestion that they join the other participants of the ritual. It might be argued that the brahmins refer here, admittedly in a rather elliptical way, to their obligation to show up so that the ritual meets the requirements. prathamah kalpah would have been used in its specific, technical meaning. In this connection it should be noted that the authors of the plays, who show a detailed knowledge of rituals, must have known prathamah kalpah as a techni cal expression. An argument against this interprétation is that the 65 Meaning, among other things, that the brahmins are in no position to refuse the meat. 66 The instance of prathamah kalpah in Râmâyana (Baroda-ed.) II 46,53 should be kept separate from those in Mahäbhärata. In the Râmâyana passa ge it is used already in a 'downgraded' sense, without any reference to sacri fice: esa me prathamah kalpo yad ambà me yavïyasï / bharatâraksitam sphïtam putraräjyam aväpnuyät // It is entirely in my hands (in the sense that I cannot leave it to someone eise) whether my younger mother (i.e Kaikeyî, Bharata's mother) will obtain a situation in which her son will rule the realm, which, protected by Bharata, will be rich'. For a discussion of this verse, see Pollock 1986: 409.</page><page sequence="28">44 H. Tieren same ritual experts used the expression in other contexts as well. To mention only those plays which are concerned with ritual: In Pancarâtra, at the end of the first act, just before leaving for the cattle raid on the Virâta king, Drona suggests that Sakuni should lead the infantry, occupying the first chariot. Sakuni agréés with the words bâdham \ prathamah kalpah |®7 "Good! An excellent suggestion" (Wool ner 1930: 1/121). In the préludé to the sixth act of Pratimâ, two old ascetics witness Jatâyus falling down from the sky after being slain by Rävana. One of the ascetics suggests that they both go to Râma to inform him of what has happened, at which the other answers: bädham \ prathamah kalpah |68 "Yes, that were best" (Woolner 1930:1/192). After this, they leave the stage. Furthermore, as argued above the evidence for an early date for these plays is far from convincing. As a resuit we cannot be certain that the instances in plays like Abhiseka indeed reflect the early stages in the development of prathamah kalpah as a 'dramatic' expression. For ail we know, the instances in Abhiseka, Crubhariga and Madhya ma represent the end of the development, which resulted in the use of prathamah kalpah as a standard expression of agreement. In this con nection the élaboration in these plays with bâdham is significant. It should be noted that these plays show a development of their own, in that bâdham, prathamah kalpah is invariably found at the end of an act or scene, functioning as it were as a eue for the actors to leave the stage.'"' The factors involved in the origin of this specialized use, which 07 See Pr. I: 389,4. r'8 See Prat. VI: 303,4 (prose after v. 4). "" Thus, at the end of the fourth act of Svapnaväsavadatta the jester informs Udayana that in the afternoon the king of Magadha will receive his friends, at which réception Udayana will occupy the place of honour. Vasanta urges the king to rise, which Udayana does, saying bädham \ prathamah kalpah | (Dkvadhak 1962: 34,11 [prose after v. 8]) "Yes indeed. It is a good suggestion" (Wooi.nkk 1930: 1/58). At the end of the fourth act of Bälacarita a soldier (bhata) informs Krsna that Kamsa has invited him to participate in the 'Bow festival' (dhanurmaho näma mahotsavo | Dkvadhak 1962: 549,15 (prose after ν. 12) |) in Madhurä. Krsna sees the festival as an opportunity to carry out the secret intention of the gods. His brother suggests that they go together at once, at which Krsna says bâdham \ prathamah kalpah | (Dkva dhak 1962: 549,19 [prose immediately before v. 13]) "Yes, that's the thing" (Woolnkr 1930: 11/136).

In the middle of the second act KurangT's nurse advises Avimära ka to sneak into the princess' harem that very night as the minister in charge of the harem had been sent on a mission to accompany an envoy. Avimära ka considers that it would be stupid to waste such an excellent opportunity:</page><page sequence="29">Three Men in a Row 45 is typical of other plays from South India as well, for instance those by the South Indian king Kulasekharavarman,70 obviously need to be explained. The second scénario for the origin of prathamah kalpah as a 'drama tic' expression starts from the occurrences in the plays by Asvaghosa and in Syämilaka's Pädatäditaka, the earliest evidence of Sanskrit drama. Both playwrights seem to have used prathamah kalpah by way of a joke, transplanting a technical expression from the ritual to the boudoir of a courtezan. Its use seems to have involved a travesty of its original, technical meaning and the solemn context from which it originated. Thus, in Pädatäditaka, when the vita, asked to enumerate the characteristics of the vita, compiles with the words prathamah kalpah71 "A marvellous idea!" (Schokker 1976: 6), upon which he sets off {srüyatäm . . .). The idea is that the vita is just the right person to supply the information. With the words prathamah kalpah he seems to imply that it would be wrong of him to entrust this task to someone eise, a pratinidhi. A similar explanation may also account for the earliest dramatic instance of prathamah kalpah, namely in one of the plays by As vaghosa. The relevant passage is found on the reverse of fragment 8: avikkhittena hidayena ädamso dhärayitavvo - nüya - prathamah kalpah (Lüders 1911: 69) '[ganikä:\ "You must hold up the mirror with an unperturbed heart." näyaka: "prathamah kalpah'". bädham \ prathamah kalpah | (Devadhar 1962: 127,7 [prose after v. 7]) "Yes, you're right, that's an excellent idea" (Masson 1970: 56). 70 At the end of the second act of Kulasekharavarman's Tapatïsam varana the vidüsaka informs the king that 'The chief among the sages, for fear of Démons, has asked me that "Your friend must be persuaded to be présent here". So let us go there'. Samvarana answers: bädham \ prathamah kalpah \ (ed. T. Ganapathi Sastri. Delhi 1987, p. 89,3 [prose after v. 13]) "Certainly we should" (Unni 1995: 172), and départs together with the vidüsaka. At the end of the third act of this same king's Subhadrädhananjaya the vidüsaka informs the king that the marriage mandapa is ready and that he should hurry. At this the king answers: bädham | prathamah kalpah \ (ed. T. Ganapathi Sastri. Delhi 1987, p. 123 [prose after v. 16]). — The instance in the fifth act of Kulasekharavarman's Tapatlsamvarana is not found at the very end where it should be expected, but nearly so. The charioteer asks the king if he may let loose the reins. The king replies with the words bädham \ prathamah kalpah \ (p. 179,1 [prose after v. 15]) "Certainly! That you may do" (Unni 1995: 199). A short prose passage and a verse later they leave the stage. 71 See Schokker 1966: 73 (15,4). The fact that Pädatäditaka, manuscripts of which are found only in the South, aligns with the North Indian texts as far as the use of prathamah kalpah is concerned (without bädham), would corrobo rât® Schokker's conclusion that the play hailed from North India (cf. De Vreese 1972). This, of course, does not rule out the possibility that it was revised in the South.</page><page sequence="30">46 Η. ΤΐΒΚΚΝ With prathamah kalpah the customer seems to say that he is the right person to perform this service of holding up her mirror. Nothing in the world could make him leave this pleasant task to someone eise, a pratinidhi.1'1 If my interprétation of prathamah kalpah in these two passages is correct, in later instances of the expression it is difficult to detect traces of its technical meaning. In the absence of indices the examples discussed below are restricted to the well-known instances from Kâli dâsa's plays. One of these, in Kälidäsa's Abhijnânasâkuntala, is found at the beginning of the seventh act in a dialogue between the king and his charioteer. The king expresses his desire to make a pradaksina around the Prajâpati Kasyapa, the charioteer agreeing with the words äyusman | prathamah kalpah |73 "An undeniable proposai, sire" (Coul son 1981: 146). Next, the charioteer lets the chariot descend from the sky74. Another instance is found in the fïrst act of Mâlavikâgnimitra. The dancing teachers Haradatta and Ganadâsa agreed to let the king décidé which of the two is the better teacher. According to the vi dûsaka they were right in doing so, leaving the matter in the right hands. Next, Ganadâsa says: 'prathamah kalpah. May the king listen carefully'7·'. In the fïfth act of Sâkuntala the heroine intends to remove the king's doubts about their marriage by showing the ring. The king responds with the words prathamah kalpah "That's the first essential" (Coulson 1981: 114)7(i. 72 Compare this scene with 'The épisode of the mirror' in Asvaghosa's Saundarananda IV 13ff. 73 See R. Pisohel's ed. (Kiel 1877). p. 151,9. 74 rathâvataranam nâtayitvâ (ib.). 75 prathamah kalpah \ avahito devah âroturn arhati | (ed. R. P. DwivedT. Varanasi 1986, p. 338 [11])· ™ While Pischel (p. 105,1) notes a variant reading prathamah san kalpah, Monier Williams in his édition (1876: 205) reads udârah kalpah (given as a varia lectio by R. P. DwivedT in his ed. [Varanasi 1986], p. 604 [21,2]) instead, which variants show that the origin of the expression was lost sight of, if not by Kälidäsa himself then by later scribes. The transference of prathamah to samkalpah in the pravesaka to the fourth act (varassa anurûvassa kannâ padivâdanïa tti aam däva padhamo samkappo \ tamjai devvam jje.vva rnmpâde di nam kadattho guruano \ [ed. R. Pischel, p. 71,3-5] "Well, surely what he hoped for from the start ..." [Coulson 1981: 88]), might be taken as an indication that the confusion goes back to Kâlidâsa himself. For samkalpah in a similar context Monier Williams (1876: 135n. 2) refers to the following passage from the first act: guruiw una se anurûavarappadâne samkappo (p. 22,13f.) "But her guardian does plan to bestow her when a worthy suitor appears" (Coulson 1981: 55).</page><page sequence="31">Three Men in a Row 47 It would seem that in Kälidäsa's plays prathamah kalpah no longer carried any of the connotations of its use in connection with ritual, but instead was used as a kind of standard expression of agreement.77 This suggests that Kälidäsa borrowed prathamah kalpah from the works of his predecessors as a ready-made 'dramatic' expression of agreement. As such the expression may have found its way into the South Indian plays, in which, however, it came to be used specifically as a reply to the suggestion to leave or to go somewhere. In many respects the fate of prathamah kalpah in drama resembles that of such terms as svämin, bhadramukha, sugrhitanäman and räs triya. As shown by Lévi (1903) we have to do here with terms adopted by the playwrights from the officiai court language of the Ksatrapas. As terms for addressing a very high person they were likewise liable to be travestied, for instance in addressing a child as bhadramukha (Lévi 1903: 97). In this connection I should like to draw attention to yet another expression found in Harsa's Nägänanda, which may have been borro wed from the Sätavähanas, the successors of the Ksatrapas in the Northern Deccan. It concerns the description of the vidüsaka of him self as a ekka(ssa) bamhana(ssa)78, 'unique (i. e. without a second) brah min\ The very same expression is found in connection with the Sä tavähana king Gautamlputra Sätakarni in the Näsik inscription, end 1. 7: ekakusasa (?) ekadhanudharasa ekasurasa ekabamhanasa (quoted from Bühler 1890: 85). The uniqueness of the vidüsaka's brahmin hood lies in the fact that while a brahmin by birth he speaks Prakrit. Given this situation it is tempting to identify his words ekka bamhana as a reference to ekabamhana of the Sätavähanas, who likewise claim brahmin status while using Prakrit in their inscriptions. While ekka bamhana, in contrast to prathamah kalpah and, for instance, svämin, did not acquire a second life but is found only in Harsa's Nägänanda, it may have fathered the expression ekavidya with which in certain texts on dramaturgy and poetics the vita is characterized (see Schok kkr 1966: 44f. n. 135); despite his vast learning the vita remains a poor man running errands in the courtezans' quarter. 77 It should be noted, however, that samkalpa, likeprathamah kalpah, was used in connection with ritual as well, denoting the détermination of the sacrificer. 78 Ed.

Tieken Concluding Remarks It would seem that the fact that prathamah kalpah in Abhiseka, Ürubhanga and Madhyama is found in contexts similar to the ones in Mänava Dharmasästra and Mahâbhârata is more or less a coincidence. It is the fate of a common expression. As to the question whether this expression was indeed introduced into drama as a technical term used specifically in connection with ritual dépends, among other things, on the interprétation of the instances in Asvaghosa's play and in Pâda tâditaka; or, if with prathamah kalpah the speaker indeed rejects the idea of leaving the task to someone eise. However, the main aim of this article was to trace the origin of the stereotyped set of three men appearing in some of the Trivandrum plays. The three men have been identified with the brahmins to be invited, fed and paid at the rituals referred to in the plays. A closer study has shown that the plays are indeed mainly concerned with the effectiveness of ritual, their happy endings consisting of the successful completion, after much strife and repeated interruptions, of certain rituals: râjasûya in the case of Pancarâtra, abhiseka in the case of Abhiseka (and Pratimà), srâddha in the case of Ürubhanga, and upa nayana in the case of Madhyama. As such these plays form an inde pendent subgroup within the main stream of classical Sanskrit drama, which is instead concerned with, among other things, marriage as a means of acquiring political alliances. The plots duplicate the course of the specific rituals and anticipate the results issuing from their successful completion. In this connection I would like to return to a point already briefly referred to above, namely the viability of that type of investigation which tries to iden tify rasa as a factor in the construction of the plot and which, for in stance, attempts to explain déviations from the original epic or Pur ànic taie with reference to the playwright's desire to create the condi tions consistent with a particular rasa. As a case in point Gerow's interprétation has been mentioned of Duryodhana's last words in terms of karuna rasa. The portrayal of a forgiving Duryodhana was in fact motivated by quite différent concerns. It zeroes in on the fear of those staying behind that Duryodhana might. go to heaven füll of hatred and from there harrass them for the rest of their lives. While this twist may be incompatible with the epic story, it clearly serves a purpose in ordinary life in which people want to be reassured that the dying die peacefully and without hatred. The task of the author of Ürubhanga seems to have been to compose a play suitable for a funeral cermony. His handling of the epic story was in the first place determined by the purpose of setting at rest the minds of fearful mourners. In this the aesthetic component of a dra</page><page sequence="33">Three Men in a Row 49 matic performance will undoubtedly have played a major role. Howe ver, if the playwright was aware of rasa, as a rudimentary concept or in the form of its later élaboration, and if so, how he worked it into his play, is difficult to ascertain. In this connection it should be noted that for a writer of a play rasa consists merely of a set of items, figures and situations with a spécification of the various reactions they elicit from the audience, and some général ideas about consistency and cohérence. In my view the importance of rasa in the act of writing a play is often highly exaggerated. Typically, studies which try to identify the domi nant rasa, or rasas, of a play rarely make clear what they exactly are looking for, though in the end they always manage to find something. In any case I hope to have shown that there is another, and for the moment at least, more rewarding, approach to Sanskrit plays than that. I venture to suggest, for instance, that the answer to the enigma tic character of the two 'envoy' plays, Dûtaghatotkaca and Dütaväk ya, will not be found in rasa, but rather in the rules of étiquette of the sabhâ, which are flaunted, in the verbal artistry shown by the envoy who présents speaking weapons, or in the role of Dhrtarâstra, who in both plays tries to appease the offended envoy.
