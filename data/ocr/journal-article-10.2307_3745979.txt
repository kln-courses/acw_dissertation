<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS up, as a moder who no longer has any connection with an organized religion may still have a liking for a hymn learned in childhood or a liturgy reverenced by his parents, but on a "recognition of its spiritual value," that value con- sisting largely in its very vagueness. Vergil has an affection for the traditional deities of the woods and fields; but he is still more interested in and devoted to the ancestral ritual, which he knew with a thoroughness that impressed ancient commentators and furnishes welcome material for moderns who would learn the forms which the piety of the countryside took. For the conventional great gods and the conventional manner of approaching them he had much less deep feeling; for the picturesque anthropomorphic figures he had least of all; they were pretty, even beautiful, subjects for his fancy, but not objects either of solid belief or of profound emotion; nor had they been so, to any educated man, for centuries. But, for Vergil as for Varro and many other men of good will just then, even the State cult was not dead and might yet be the vehicle, albeit in a form which the understanding would interpret after their own fashion and not as its originators had done, of high thought and spiritual values. Apollo and his divine archery might be no more than a lovely figure of venerable tradition; it by no means followed that no superhuman power had watched over Augustus or guided the fortunes of the decisive day at Actium. So also with the beliefs concerning the dead. No one, certainly not Dr. Bailey, supposes that Vergil imagined it literally true that, if one went through certain prescribed rites and knew where to find a particular opening in the ground, he would come to a place where the ghosts of his ancestors flitted about in unsubstantial happiness or lay in supernatural torments. But this is not to say that Vergil assumed merely for poetical purposes the existence of the human soul. Rather "he takes the traditions of folk-lore and myth and using them as his framework, refines them to the measure of his own philosophic vision" (p. 315). That the soul, that man, dead or alive, was capable of "ultimate triumph coming through suffering" (p. 318), the author supposes to have been a serious belief of the poet, and the reviewer entirely agrees with him. In the case of so exceptional a man as the Emperor, Vergil did not flatter when he hailed him as a god, but rather, in the expression of a real belief, "outran the official pace" (p. I96), and was rather checked than incited by his knowledge of the official views on this subject. The Providence which ruled his universe, whatever traditional names of Fate and Fortune he might give it, could and did show itself through such a personality with such a mission; and such a man had genuinely in him not a little which could fairly be called divine. These then, in barest outline and with omission of a hundred controversial points of philological, historical, or philosophic detail, are the ideas concerning God and man which Dr. Bailey finds in the poet who was hailed as a prophet and a saint by many centuries of godly men, much though their own beliefs differed from one another's and from his; who was to Horace an anima candida, while the Middle Ages greeted him with da Christo testimonium. H. J. ROSE. The Relations of Morality to Religion. By W. G. DE BURGH. Annual Philo- sophical Lecture, Henriette Hertz Trust, British Academy, 1935. From the Proceedings of the British Academy, Vol. XXI. (London: Humphrey Milford. I935. Pp. 27. Price 2s.) The writer of this notice finds himself so closely in agreement with the view of the relations of morality to religion and of religion to philosophy which is expounded by Professor de Burgh in his recent lecture delivered p 225</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY before the British Academy that there is little left for him to do, when he has given a brief account of the contents of the lecture, but to "say ditto" to the lecturer. Professor de Burgh shows very clearly that morality and religion are mutually independent forms of experience, and that the relation between them, "however intimate it may prove to be, is not one of necessary connexion" (p. 5). Morality is autonomous, as Kant held; and it is justly observed that this philosopher's "postulation" of God does nothing to imperil its autonomy (p. 4). Morality does not grow into religion by a process of mere expansion. The love of man which, for religion, is rooted in the love of God (p. Io), cannot be reached, as M. Bergson has pointed out in his recent remarkable book, Les Deux Sources de la Morale et de la Religion, by the extension over a wider area of the love we bear toward those who are fellow-members with ourselves of a "closed" society (pp. 10, II). Religion again does not, like morality, essentially belong to the sphere of practice, as Bradley held, and as Mr. Oakeshott has recently "reaffirmed with uncompromising vigour" (p. I5). "While" it "implies conduct as well as knowledge, just as morality implies knowledge as well as conduct, the theoretical moment is for religion all- important" (p. I3). "In religious experience . . . action is always for the sake of knowledge." "The religious life in its essence is the life eternal, which is to know God" (p. I5). Bradley's own admission that "faith in the real being of God" is "the mark which distinguishes religion from morality" "is fatal to the view that religion is exclusively a form of practice" (p. I7). Yet Professor de Burgh will not identify religion with mysticism, and criticizes M. Bergson for sometimes seeming to do so (p. I ). Practice, if not primary in religion, is indispensable to it, since "only in worshipping God do we learn to know him" (p. I8), and it is "when, as in Plato and Spinoza" philo- sophy "proclaims a way of life" that "it passes over into religion" (p. 20). I may here remark in passing that, in his interesting observations on Spinoza (p. 22), Professor de Burgh finds in some statements of the Ethics more than I can convince myself is really there: but this is not to deny that the temper of the great Jewish thinker is, as Professor de Burgh says, profoundly religious, whether his doctrine be held fully to justify this temper or no. Though metaphysics and religion are rival claimants to universal know- ledge, "and neither claimant can brook the intrusion of a rival within its borders" (p. 24), yet a reconciliation is possible. "They traverse common ground, but they view the scene from a different angle, and, for all their co-operation, pursue different paths. Religion is theocentric, and regards the world and man in the light of the Creator's revelation of himself. Meta- physics, on the other hand, takes its start from within the created universe, and only at long last, if ever, and then by aid of religious experience, acknow- ledges its dependence upon God. Metaphysical knowledge, again, is impersonal; it is 'about' things, which it interprets through general concepts; while religious knowledge comes by personal contact between God and the indi- vidual" (p. 25). "It is because God is thus known by personal contact that the way of religion lies open alike to the learned and the unlearned, while metaphysics is the exclusive privilege of an intellectual elite" (p. 26). I might perhaps hesitate over one or two expressions in these sentences; but I believe that substantially they state the truth about the relations of philosophy and religion in their fully developed forms. Professor de Burgh has the gift of coining phrases which stick in the memory. I will quote two such. One about Pascal's hard saying, "II faut s'abetir": "The great musician, too, will practice scales" (p. 12); another about "humanism": "If man would enter upon his kingdom, he must forgo the claim to be its king."
