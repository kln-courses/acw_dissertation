<plain_text><page sequence="1">MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. IF we reflect on the gradual disappearance of those relig- ious dogmas which for so long exercised an undisputed authority both on the reason and on the feelings of mankind, and the very thought of whose extinction aroused the most intense horror in the minds of our predecessors, there seems no presumption in inquiring whether morality be not itself an untenable dogma, a remnant of the old superstition, and, as it were, the 'ast chain of the primitive slavery of man. Nor are we unjustified in questioning the validity of doctrines and sen- timents already opposed or denounced by great thinkers of various ages, as in Hume's denial of moral obligation, in the vehement attacks of Helvetius and Bentham on the current ethical ideals, and in the predictions repeated in our own day by Mr. Spencer as to the coming disappearance of duty as a recognized spring of action. In view of the light thrown by modern science on the nature and probable origin of the moral consciousness, and taking also into account the constant growth and the increasing stability of the feelings of freedom and independence, whose recogni- tion necessarily implies in many cases, as I shall explain further on, a sort of moral indifference and a tendency to place sight in the foreground and duty in the background; I think the conclusion is not unwarranted that, in the course of time, all moral feelings (those, that is, involving such ideas as obliga- tion or compulsion, duty and the like) will disappear from the human mind and cease to have any influence upon the further development of the race. This conclusion may be briefly stated by saying, that the evolution (I might better say the dissolution) of morality is from ' duty' towards ' right,' fie former diminishing as the latter illcreases. In order to make this theory well understood, and to meet some objections often urged against the naturalistic philosophy, I shall remind the</page><page sequence="2">372 T HE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. reader of some principles which, while generally admitted, are frequently forgotten or disregarded. There are two very important psychological laws, which it is necessary to bear in mind in an inquiry concerning the validity and authority of ethical theories: first, that action ultimately depends upon feeling, not upon mere knowledge or judgment; second, that a feeling which, through the experiences and mental associations of the race or the individual, has become like an organic element of the mind cannot be suddenly eliminated, when it is discovered that its promptings are contrary to reason or opposed to a different mode of acting dictated by new judg- ments arising from a better acquaintance with, and a sounder interpretation of, the phenomena of nature. The first proposition is sufficiently obvious, and therefore I shall not dwell on it at length, contenting myself with calling attention to the well-known fact that, although feeling is finally the spring of action, judgment usually plays an important part in the origination of our feelings. Indeed, judgment and feel- ing react upon each other, and either give rise to, or greatly modify each other. Which one will have the supremacy depends upon circumstances ; but what is here to be emphasized, and what the second of the two laws mentioned above implies, is, that feeling and judgment are very often opposed to each other; and, where this opposition exists, our actions, obeying the promptings of our feelings, must of necessity be contrary to our judgments, the former apparently giving the lie to the latter, - a condition of affairs made still worse by our fruitless efforts to reconcile the two antagonistic states of the mind, whose sup- posed unity would be destroyed if we accepted the coexistence in it of what seem to be mutually destructive elements. Very often a special feeling invariably follows a special judg- ment; and, by an 'association of ideas,' the feeling finally comes to be excited by the mere presence of the subject of the judgment, even if the judgment be not actually formed. This happens especially in those cases in which the judgment has been formed often and the corresponding feeling has been very intense: the feeling, which originally required the intermediary</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.] MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. 373 agency of a conscious recognition of its cause, is finally aroused by what may be termed an unconscious recognition, and consti- tutes one of those emotional states for which seemingly there is no cause. It is to be observed that in all cases of this kind, where the original immediate causes of the emotion have dis- appeared from consciousness, the feeling is necessarily vague and indistinct; or, in more strict language, its cause is indefi- nitely apprehended. The child who, on being left alone in the dark, cries for some one to keep him company, saying that he feels afraid, is unable to say what he is afraid of; nevertheless, he is evidently the victim of an indefinite, yet very strong, terror, although he may never have heard of ghosts, apparitions, or other imaginary beings, the belief in which was the main cause of similar feelings in his progenitors. Nor is this all. These inherited feelings, further developed and strengthened by the tales of nurses and ignorant parents, may never leave him during his life, however much he may improve his knowledge and correct his judgments. The reason is very obvious: a constant recurrence of the same feeling through a series of generations, or even through a long period of individual life, produces organic alterations in the nervous centres, which it requires the reaction of an opposite feeling or of a correct- ing judgment, during, if not an equal, at least a very long, time to retransform. While the process of reorganization is going on, judgment will be overruled by feeling, and by a feeling the legitimacy of whose authority is denied by the very subject who experiences and obeys it. But it is evident that, in the end, a feeling will be organized corresponding to the judgment, and the opposite feeling will disappear. The application of the foregoing conclusions to the moral problem' I take to be of the utmost theoretical importance; for they partly lead to, and partly justify, the further probable conclusion that morality, with its machinery of obligation, conscience, and duty, being based on feelings originated in superstition and slavery, and in an inadequate and unscien- tific conception of the world in general, and of man in partic- ular, is doomed to vanish under the pressure of enlightened</page><page sequence="4">374 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. reason, which will cease to consider it either necessary or profitable. While a declaration of this sort may seem startling and cynical to some, and repulsive to others, it must be remem- bered that it is the privilege of the student to place himself at the point of view of an impartial spectator, who, by observing the path man has followed in the past and the direction in which he is moving at present, endeavors to discover, not what the future condition of the race ought to be, or what condition would be most desirable, but what actually will be the condi- tion in question. If the picture appear shocking, it is only because of our inherited, but unreasonable, habit of judging nature by the standard of our sentiments. But, once we have objectized man and included him in the great universal whole, as but one of the infinite cosmical phenomena, we shall cease to be ' morally' shocked or disgusted. What is apprehended as necessary, as ' natural,' can never give rise to indignation, con- tempt, or hatred; and, as we pass no moral or condemnatory judgments on the bloody struggles of our animal and savage progenitors, reflection might lead us to look with equanimity upon the probable amoral (if I may coin this word) condition of our remote descendants, however revolting this condition may be to our present modes of feeling. Before proceeding with my exposition, I wish to remark that, in the course of this discussion, I take the evolutionary, monis- tic, and utilitarian theories for granted, at least to a certain extent ; but, unlike some distinguished advocates of these views, I do not think that morality can be identified with hygiene, dietetics, gymnastics, and other sciences and arts, which, although of great importance and utility, are not in themselves branches of what is ordinarily termed ethics. Dr. Bain, I believe, has said that there can be no ethics without moral disapprobation, which implies the idea of duty, and those feelings known as conscience (what Bain calls the "slavish conscience ") and obligation. What remains after these have been removed, may be termed the science of useful or pleasant conduct, but not the science of moral conduct ethics, morality. And, considering what disturbing effects</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.] MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. 375 one single word can introduce into a philosophic system, and how it can oppose the progress of an otherwise commendable doctrine, it were advisable not to make use of such terms as ' ethical,' ' moral,' ' ethics,' ' morality,' except where strictly necessary. Where no one would dispute that it is better for a man to eat rice pudding than apple pie, a controversy would be sure to arise as soon as that proposition was announced as a fundamental ' principle of ethics.' The characteristic feature of the moral consciousness I take to be the idea or feeling of 'duty,' first manifesting itself in the individual in the form of that feeling or sensibility known as 'conscience.' But it is necessary to distinguish the truly moral element in conscience from other concrete elements, which, although usually associated with it, and often included under the same name, are really of a different kind from moral feelings properly so called, and must not, strictly speaking, be considered as either identical with, or as components of, the moral conscience.' Such, for instance, are the feelings of shame and regret, both of which are frequently found acting independently of, and even in opposition to, our moral feelings. The boy who, although convinced that it is his duty to say his prayers, feels ashamed to do so before his unbelieving school- mates, and the timid young man who against his conscience indulges in intemperance and breaks his vows or resolutions of chastity in the presence of his less scrupulous companions, are illustrations of the truth that while the sense of concrete shame is no doubt a powerful deterrent from wrong-doing, it is not to be identified with conscience proper.2 Likewise the feeling of regret, often present with remorse, is not seldom experienced outside of all sense of duty; and it is well known that a person I By a concrete feeling I understand one which is referred, either directly or by a mental representation, to a particular, specific cause: eg., fear of a particu- lar individual or of punishment of some kind inflicted by a known agent. An abstract feeling is not accompanied by a mental representation of its cause: e.g., superstitious fear of the dead; shame experienced by an over-chaste woman at beholding her own nude body; fear of a child in the dark, etc. The latter feelings owe their origin to an association of ideas. 2 See Leslie Stephen's Science of Ethics, ch. VIII, ?? I2, I4.</page><page sequence="6">376 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. sometimes regrets having done a good action. The thief may repent of having neglected an opportunity to steal, and the miser may reproach himself for having inadvertently yielded to a charitable impulse. Similar remarks apply to all other concrete feelings, such as fear of punishment ; and the general principle may be established, that the moment con- science assumes the form of a concrete feeling, it ceases to be a moral feeling. Conscience, I apprehend, in the strictly moral sense of the word, is mainly an abstract feeling of fear of punishment most vividly exhibited in the feeling of remorse following the com- mission of an immoral act; to which it must be added, that it is exclusively an egoistic feeling, inasmuch as it is a painful state experienced by the individual on his own account, and not a sympathetic or altruistic sentiment. The genesis of this feeling has been well explained by Dr. Bain, Mr. Spencer, and others, although, I believe, they sometimes include in the moral consciousness elements which might be otherwise classified.' Here I shall deal with the matter in a general manner, and only in so far as is necessary for the complete understanding of my subject. In the early stages of human development, man is accustomed to look upon nature as on an aggregate of superhuman beings, having an irresistible influence upon his life, whose operations he cannot change at will, and to whose rules he must submit. Together with these views is found the belief that the chief of the tribe has a divine authority over all his subjects, and that his decisions are the decisions of a superior power, from whose decrees there is no possible way of escaping; the latter cir- cumstance giving rise to a feeling of absolute, slavish, and unconditional submission, and to a recognition of the neces- sary obligatoriness -that is, unavoidableness -of all acts of obedience. All modes of conduct violating the commands of the chief are usually followed by severe punishment and threats of further punishment to be administered by invisible rulers. 1 See, for instance, Bain's Emotions and Will, pt. I, ch. XV, ? 22, and pt. II, ch. X, ? 8; Spencer's Data q/f Ethics, ch. VII.</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.] MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. 377 Without mentioning the fear of individual revenge consequent upon aggression, nor the fear of the disapprobation of fellow- beings (the latter feeling being probably a transformation of the former), we have two very powerful sanctions, the sanction of despotism and the sanction of superstition. By a process of association, easy to understand, the feeling of fear gradually comes to accompany the commission of forbidden acts, even if the idea of punishment be not actually present in conscious- ness. In thus passing from the concrete or definite to the abstract or indefinite, those primitive, animal emotions origi- nally recognizable as the offspring of despotism and superstition, are changed into the more respectable feelings constituting the conscience. The sense of external authority and coercion survives in the form of moral obligation; while the dread of an unavoidable punishment inflicted on the disobedient subject survives in the form of remorse. Of the fact that the 'pangs' and ' recriminations' of a ' guilty conscience' are in reality an abstract feeling of fear, we may convince ourselves by observing the actions of a man acting against what he con- siders his duty. At the moment of perpetrating a crime, the criminal, however certain he may be of the absence of all witnesses, instinctively looks around him with anxiety, as if afraid of something or somebody; after perpetrating it, he is continually haunted by the threatening image of his victim; and, in civilized countries, the terrors of remorse usually pre- sent themselves in the form of policemen, detectives, and exe- cutioners. Not that these concrete feelings in themselves constitute conscience ; but conscience, in passing from the abstract form to the concrete, very plainly betrays its origin. Notwithstanding the great stress laid by sentimentalists and intuitionists on the freedom of the will and the responsibility of man as a moral agent, they also recognize the externality of the sanction giving conscience its authoritative and impera- tive character. Far from seeing in it a purely subjective state, disconnected from all external causes, except in so far as it judges the acts of the individual, they see in it the manifestation of an outside power; something which is not the will, since to</page><page sequence="8">378 THE PHIL OSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. it the will yields and obeys; which is not the work of the mind, for experience shows that the mind is impotent either to destroy or to create it; something irresistible, to which we must sub- mit, and do submit; in short, something which is not self, but above and more powerful than self. Taking this feeling of externality as an irrefragable testimony given by conscience as to its own origin from a higher source than the individual, and interpreting it by saying that conscience itself declares its authority to be 'delegated,' they have found in this 'faculty' one of their favorite demonstrations of the existence of a Supreme Being.' The feeling in question may, however, be explained on a more probable, if less flattering, hypothesis. I think I can now derive the consequences which I believe follow from the above doctrines, and from others of similar import, as well as from a new order of feelings tending more and more to displace the old moral feelings. There exists in man an ever growing tendency to assert his own independence, in so far as that independence is consistent with his well-being; to admit no restrictions as legitimate but those to which he voluntarily submits in view of his own inter- est; and to repudiate, as unwarranted and unjustifiable oppres- sion, all external authority whose credentials have not been previously approved by his unfettered judgment and recognized as conducive to his happiness and security. While a feeling of revolt against all kinds of despotism develops, a corresponding judgment is formed -that feelings implying unconditional and blind obedience are to be rejected, their authority being denied both by reason and (at least partially) by a strong sense of free- dom, with which the sense of duty is obviously inconsistent. Conscience, in whose elements of moral obligation and remorse we have discovered the traces of slavish and superstitious sub- jection, is not likely to survive very long the naturalistic conception of its origin, nor to resist the opposing influence of new feelings and rectified judgments disputing its place in consciousness. ' Right' is constantly taking some ground from 1 See Martineau's Ty7pes of Ethical Theory, 2d ed., vol. II, pp. I04-5; also Flint's Theism, Lecture VII.</page><page sequence="9">No. 4.] MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. 379 the domain of 'duty,' and the indications seem to be that, in the future development of the race, the ' moral sense,' becom- ing rudimentary, will end by leaving the mind entirely. For, to my way of thinking, it is as improbable that conscience and the allied feelings will continue after their illusory foundation has been exposed, as it is that superstition will continue after its nature has been understood, and its claims found to conflict with new conceptions, as to whose validity we entertain no doubts. Man exists as a natural and necessary product of universal forces, and, like all other organic beings, obeys the law of self- preservation, so emphatically maintained by Spinoza. To use the somewhat ambiguous yet forcible expression of this philos- opher, man exists by the supreme right of nature ; that is, he has a right to live and to preserve his being by following those subjective guides ("sovereign masters," as Bentham calls them) which, in the form of pleasure and pain, lead him to the per- formance of acts which promote his well-being and develop his life, and deter him from the performance of acts tending to impair his vital energies. When I refer to these conditions as 'rights,' I mean that they must be accepted as facts that, being of a necessary character, cannot be reprobated on any rational grounds. It is also a matter of fact that, in pursuing its own interests, every organism constantly finds itself in the presence of other organisms whose interests and welfare cannot but conflict with its own ; whence results a struggle wherein the inferior organism must succumb and the superior organism survive and propagate. Whether this condition of affairs be repulsive or shocking, and whether it 'ought' to be different from what it is, are questions no longer to be asked, once we have discarded the old idea of an arbitrary will governing the phenomena of nature. In the above order of facts we have the law of natural 'justice' (to employ a very objectionable term), so well expounded by Darwin and Spencer, but whose application to human justice is only partially made by the latter, who, notwithstanding the sternness of his philosophy, sometimes yields (unconsciously, no doubt) to the promptings</page><page sequence="10">380 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. of traditional sentimentality in favor of one class or another. And here comes the final and most important of all questions: Is there any warrant for substituting in place of natural justice those artificial systems embraced under the appellation of morality ? Having formulated the question in this blunt manner, I am very liable to be misunderstood and prejudged at the outset; and for this reason I wish to say, before proceeding, that my objections are not to the usual modes of acting, but to the usual modes of feeling and of judging. While I do not doubt that he who murders another may with propriety be executed or imprisoned, I dispute the propriety of saying that he has violated the 'moral law,' or that he has performed a ' wrong' action, taking the word 'wrong ' in its subjective or intuitionist sense (and this I hold to be the moral sense of the term). This will appear more plainly in the course of my exposition. Suppose that, being hungry, I meet a man carrying some food, draw out my dagger, kill him, and satisfy my hunger. You say I have acted against my duty, against my moral obli- gation, and that I ought not to murder my fellow-being, because that is not right. But what is the import of these expressions? In old times it was believed - instinctively believed - that the community had an indisputable claim upon the individual; that his acts must conform to the will of chiefs and gods; that injury inflicted by him upon his fellows was followed by divine pun- ishment here and hereafter; and that it was necessary for him to sacrifice his welfare to the whims of a despot invested by the gods with supernatural authority. These, and similar experiences, slowly grew into the further belief that the in- terests of others were to be looked after by every individual in preference to his own, and, by a very natural extension of the principle, that he was not performing his part - or doing his ' duty' - when simply endeavoring to further his own well- being, but that, on the contrary, self-sacrifice was what was expected of him; and when to such feelings was added the fear of the various sanctions, a state of mind arose from which the moral feelings - conscience, moral obligation, etc. - gradually</page><page sequence="11">No. 4.] MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. 381 evolved. It is true that we still have these feelings, and act in accordance with them; it is true that, in the above case, you may appeal to my feelings, and that, controlled by them, I may concur in your view of the matter, sharing your indignation and your horror. But you cannot, I believe, appeal to my understanding, nor will you be able to find in your understand- ing any justification of your own feelings on the subject. The genesis of these feelings shows us that their authority is based on erroneous judgments, implicit or explicit, and, although they have been organized in our system and cannot be suddenly displaced, they must vanish under the continual action of rectified judgments. For these judgments tell us that we do not depend upon any supernatural beings ; that our lives are not governed by the arbitrary dictates of a free will, not even our own; that the community has no de lure claim upon us, although it may have a de facto claim ; that the only limit to our actions is set by our own interests, of whatever kind; that the individual is not an instrument of the gods or of the com- munity, but rather the community is an instrument of the individual in the pursuance of his own happiness ; and that, finally, the only legitimate appeal that according to reason we can make, is to the individual's own interests. He is not destined by any higher power to promote the happiness of others, to sacrifice his well-being to the well-being of others; nor do I see any reason why he should lend blind and uncon- ditional obedience to the dictates of others. Reverting to the above example, I may say that I am an organized being pos- sessed of certain desires, having certain wants, and actuated by certain feelings. Your wants are different from mine, and you gratify them in your own way; I gratify mine in my way, that is, according to the peculiarities of my organization. Can you point out anything abnormal in my way of acting? Not unless you beg the question by saying that your way of acting is the only normal way. I do not say my way of acting is the right way; I simply satisfy my wants, as you satisfy yours. You may say I have injured my fellow-man, you may imprison or execute me; but beyond these matters of fact (with which</page><page sequence="12">382 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. the feeling of sympathy may consist), you cannot go; reason refuses to sanction your despotic sense of duty, which you attempt to impose upon me. Can you tell me why it is my duty to act according to your feelings, while it is not your duty to act according to mine ? The abstract moral ideas and feelings have, indeed, been repeatedly denounced by eminent philosophers as empty words devoid of all meaning. The charge is, no doubt, exaggerated, inasmuch as the moral feelings are real facts, whose very exist- ence cannot be denied. But, I believe, the charge can be substantiated that such feelings arise from original erroneous judgments, implicit or explicit, and from too narrow a view of the phenomena under consideration. For, if I place myself on the ground of what may with propriety be termed 'pure reason,' I do not see why I should expect others to feel as I feel and act as I do, or would, act. This would be assuming a uniformity in human nature which is not countenanced by experience and observation. All I am justified in saying is that, under given circumstances, I would act thus or thus; that he who acts otherwise thinks and feels in a different manner from me, and that his organization must be different from mine; and while I may be displeased with his conduct, I cannot, or shall not -if I have thoroughly realized that he is not I, and that his motives are not, and cannot be, my motives - experience any feeling of moral disapprobation in connection with my judgment of the matter. I may dislike the act in question as I dislike a homely picture, and I may say that, in my opinion, the man is ignorant or foolish, as I say the painter is a poor artist; any further judgment takes for granted what cannot be taken for granted - that the other man's actions are to be regulated by my feelings. Nor can I find any plausi- ble reason why he should sacrifice his well-being to the well- being of others, for this would be to deny him the absolute freedom which every being possesses, in so far as that freedom is considered as the natural power with which every being is endowed. I have no claim on him, and if I am to appeal to him I must do so through his feelings, not my own; for it would be</page><page sequence="13">No. 4.] MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. 383 absurd to expect that he should act in opposition to his springs of action, and it would be equally absurd to say that it is his ' duty' to do what I would do, i.e., what would please me but not him, or that he ' ought ' to do what he really cannot do, not having the will to do it, or lacking the necessary motives to determine his will in the desired direction. If, passing from the consideration of others to myself, I examine my own feelings, I shall find that, as I recognize the freedom of others (in the understanding, of course, that I am equally free not to allow them to injure me, and to oppose my freedom to theirs whenever I am so disposed), there is no reason why they should not recognize my own freedom; that, as I have no claims upon them, nor are their actions to be regulated by my likings, they have no claims on me, nor are my actions to be regulated by their likings. If I consult and scrutinize my conscience, I find that it is a sort of ghost whose authority is derived from the servility and slavery of my ancestors, and whose 'imperative dictates' are the echoes of a state of oppres- sion and superstition against which my present feelings of freedom protest and revolt. I recognize no claims of others on me, no conscience, no obligation - I am my own master. Whatever your claims or pretensions may be, they are nothing to me, except in so far as they please or displease me. If you have a ' right' to do your pleasure, it is my ' right' to do my own pleasure; nor does it follow from the nature of things that I must consult your interests regardless of my interests. If I have any regard for your welfare, it must come from my being pleased with your welfare, not from your being dis- pleased with my conduct. In plainer terms, if I voluntarily do what is agreeable to you, I am exercising a right, and not discharging a duty; I do it because I wish to do it, not because I am ' morally obliged' to do it. It may be said that ' reason' cannot be severed from feeling, and that it is absurd to endeavor to reason our feelings out of existence ; that feelings, being ultimate facts, must be received as the motives of all human conduct, and that, however incom- prehensible they may be in themselves, they have to be taken</page><page sequence="14">384 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. into account in all investigations and discussions relating to the doings of men and their mutual relations ; and that, there- fore, the moral feelings, no matter what they may be in their ultimate nature, are to be accepted as real and very powerful springs of action, no less than hunger and thirst. To this the answer is, that the moral feelings differ from mere sensations and from other feelings and emotions in that they, being of an abstract nature and implying some more or less definite judgments (as, for instance, that something will punish me, that something compels me, etc.), can easily be eliminated by rectified judgments based on a more adequate conception of the position of man in the universe and of his relations to other organized beings ; although it must be borne in mind that the elimination cannot take place suddenly, but only gradually. I know that some objections may be raised against the present view. It is unnecessary, however, to examine them separately, considering that there is a final and - to my mind - unan- swerable argument in the doctrine of determinism, so strongly held by Spinoza, and before whose logical consequences he had, as a rule, the courage to stand without flinching, although experiencing, perhaps, a sort of ' sublime horror' at seeing the apparent contradiction between the traditional feelings of man- kind, and the dictates of reason ; between those states of mind created by an anthropomorphic and anthropocentric conception of the world, and those judgments ensuing from the concep- tion of the universe as an eternal flow of inexorable phenomena, comprising not only the material frame of man but the opera- tions of his understanding as well. Towards this conception, modified and confirmed by modern science, the intellect of our age seems to be moving with irresistible force. Man has finally been included in the realm of nature ; his origin and develop- ment are believed to be due to the same processes and laws which govern the formation and transformations of all other bodies and systems of bodies; his present condition, as well as his present conduct, are considered as fatal effects of his preceding conduct and states, the latter having been reached through a slow and continuous growth under the influence of physical forces.</page><page sequence="15">No. 4.1 MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. 385 Although incomprehensible in itself, mind is at least known, so far as experience can teach, to be the necessary concomitant of a special molecular organization whose laws are the laws of physics and of chemistry, and whose modifications must depend upon the transformations of existing forces. It is also admitted that the material system constituting the organism cannot pro- duce by itself, without cause, any change in the arrangement or proportion of its component elements, and that all mental phenomena, volition included, must follow the universal law of causation. This law, conceived to-day, not simply as a relation of succession, but as a dynamical process in which every fact is the continuation of a preceding fact ; this law, which is ulti- mately nothing but the law of inertia, by virtue of which what- ever is continues to be, and nothing begins but becomes, leaves no room for sudden and mysterious interventions either from 'within' or from 'without.' Every organism is accepted to be a laboratory whose chemical reactions appear in conscious- ness as mental states ; and the laws of general physics are finally the laws, if not of thought as such, at least of the indispensable conditions of its existence. From a system of philosophy based on these fundamental principles and holding that all phenomena, both past and future, are capable of being expressed by an algebraic equation, the belief in the so-called freedom of the will vanishes at once. And it seems evident to me that, if we reflect on the subj ect, all our moral feelings must disappear when we have become certain that human beings do not possess any personal inde- pendence; that their actions are the actions or the processes of nature; that their conduct is ruled by their organization, their organization by inheritance and environment, inheritance and environment by the eternal properties of matter and force. In judging a man we have to remember that we are not in the presence of a self-acting, 'responsible' being: we are facing the last aspect of the infinite succession of transformations of an eternal energy, whose last form cannot be conceived as non- existent without annihilating all its preceding forms and its very existence. His acts are ' modes' of this energy, and to attach</page><page sequence="16">386 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. any moral blame to them would be to condemn that eternal energy, i.e., to condemn existence because it exists. No man's conduct is his conduct; it is simply a manifestation of the way in which the universe exists and moves. There is, then, no vice, no virtue, no duty, no obligation, no good or evil, in the sense we usually give to these terms ; and morality, as traditionally understood - or, to speak more plainly, morality, without any further qualification - must be confessed to derive its authority from superstitious feelings corresponding to inadequate con- ceptions as to the nature of man and the universe of which he forms part. The above conclusions are not new, but they have seldom, if ever, been admitted by the advocates of the naturalistic and utilitarian philosophies, who -strange to say -establish the premises as indisputable, and shrink before their logical con- sequences. Their opponents urge these consequences very strongly as destructive arguments, taking it for granted that, the consequences being unjustifiable, so must be the premises from which they are derived. A few examples will give an insight into the nature of these objections, and show that, although they are based on facts and logically worked out, the use made of them betrays a complete disregard of the two psychological laws I stated at the outset. Against the more or less plausible theories advanced by J. S. Mill, Bain, and Spencer, Guyau argues that, once a feel- ing has been discovered to refer to an illusory cause, it must disappear, for when we become certain that "this or that belief is groundless," we can no longer entertain it ; that asso- ciation becomes powerless the moment it is recognized as such; that " all pain which has not a real cause in the external world, or an intelligible reason in the internal world" ceases on the recognition of the fictitiousness of its cause ; that the more we are aware that our motive is but an illusion, the less we are inclined to act agreeably to its promptings ; that, if this be the nature of the moral feelings, they have to be declared devoid of all rational grounds; and that utilitarians and evolutionists, by defending the moral feelings, which they also as well as others</page><page sequence="17">NO. 4.] MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. 387 experience, plainly demonstrate that they are not in reality convinced of the truth of their doctrines.1 Furthermore, against the doctrine of determinism the objec- tion has been raised that it destroys the foundation of society; namely, the distinction between crime and virtue. This delicate subject, intimately connected with the most excitable emotions and with very powerful passions, is naturally adapted to the rapturous pathos of eloquence and poetry ; nor has the artillery of fanaticism and intolerance failed to find in Spinoza and his modern successors a most prominent and desirable target. To-day, however, although a true philosopher may still speak of the "awful chimera" of the Jewish thinker, few will follow Malebranche in bestowing upon him the con- temptuous and contemptible epithet mniserable, and his sen- timental critics content themselves with appealing to those traditions of mankind whose authority was shaken to its very foundations by the great writer of the Ethics. What pure and noble soul, asks M. Saisset, does not feel horrified at the thoroughgoing denials of Spinoza regarding the liberty of man and even of the Supreme Being? If everything is necessary, if everything is what it must be, what warrant have we to speak of merit and demerit, virtue and vice, good and bad actions, of the moral order, of the responsibility of human beings ? If nothing exists but what has to exist, if it is a mis- take to expect that things should be different from what they are, what becomes of human and divine justice, of the belief in a future life, of religion and our trust in God ? In short, is it not obvious that the consequence of Spinozism is "that the most shameful vices, the most abominable crimes are in them- selves perfectly innocent, not containing the smallest imperfec- tion, and seeming contrary to order only because we have but an indistinct idea of things "?2 Nor are these, perhaps, the most disastrous consequences; for not only the destruction of ' See Morale anglaise contemporaine, 2me ed., pp. 294-7, 299, 34I ; ch.

V. morality, but even the annihilation of knowledge, of truth, and of science has been claimed as an undeniable corollary of determinism'. With the last-mentioned claims, however, I shall not concern myself at present, as that would carry me beyond the limits of this article. The Rev. J. L. Davies, in some criticisms of Mr. Spencer's doctrines,2 very properly calls attention to the anomaly in " the use of ethical terms by one who professes only to describe natural and necessary phenomena," and quotes the very weighty dictum of Kant, which may be taken as the most concise state- ment of the whole argument : - "If we fix our eyes simply upon the course of nature, the ought has no meaning whatever. It is as absurd to ask what nature ought to be as to ask what sort of properties a circle ought to have. The only question we can properly ask is, What comes to pass in nature ? just as we can only ask, What actually are the properties of a circle ? " It is to be observed that all the above objections (which I should venture to call 'pious' arguments) take it for granted that vice and virtue (in a moral sense), duty, good, and evil exist and must continue to exist; and, starting from this proposition as from an axiomatic truth, the critics proceed to show its incom- patibility with the consequences logically derived from the fundamental doctrines they wish to refute, thus proving, by a reductio ad absurdum, that the latter doctrines are untenable. Here I may refer to a most instructive parallel case in the history of religious controversies. In the golden age of the Christian Church, when the records of the Hebrews, as com- mented and explained by the venerable Fathers, were supposed to contain the ultimate truth of every science, it sufficed, in order to silence an investigator and annihilate his theories, together with his character and reputation, to say to him: " Your teaching is contrary to the teachings of the Christian religion. If your conclusions are correct, then Joshua did 1 See the curious articles by J. Delbceuf in Revue philoso}5hique, Mai, Juin, Juillet, i882 " Determinisme et liberty: la liberty demontree par la mecanique." 2 See Spencer's Justice, Appendix C.

Few dared to defy the authority or doubt the exactness of the inspired writers, and, rather than incur the odium of the Church and public, the horrified and perplexed truth-seeker wasted his time and exhausted his ingenuity in fruitless endeavors to reconcile the irreconcilable. Nor was the judgment of others all he feared; his own conscience whispered to him that he was marching on the road to perdition; for he himself, notwith- standing his discoveries, felt certain that the sacred books were of divine origin and had a superior authority, which it was criminal and dangerous to question, even in the secret depths of his consciousness. It was also assumed (and it is still assumed by some pious persons) that, if religion and theology lost their hold on the human mind, society would become a confused and anarchic mass, governed by instincts and appe- tites no higher than the brute's, and that humanity, ceasing to exist as such, would sink to the level of wild beasts. Grad- ually, however, the truths of science became more and more apparent; they spread by degrees and took possession of the general consciousness; slowly, but surely, the continued action of new conceptions destroyed the old views, which had been organized as feelings -blind feelings; and finally came the bold declaration: "Yes, the new discoveries are opposed to religion and its books; but the new discoveries are facts, and, as such, must stand; religion and its books must go, or a new religion with new books be produced." We all know the out- come of this struggle, and the stupendous change which has been taking place during the last three or four centuries; a feature of the change being that the new books have not been made at once, but have slowly been evolving, still preserving the old names and form, but with a new reading, which the learned divines are pleased to style interpretation. Nor does it seem improbable, although the very thought may be appalling, that this most effective organ of defence will disappear by atrophy (or, not unlikely, by hypertrophy), leaving the theologi- cal species to die in the claws of its voracious rival.</page><page sequence="20">390 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. We have here the key to the solution of the difficulties men- tioned above with respect to the moral question. The objec- tions referred to derive all their cogency from the fact that the advocates of naturalism do not act in accordance with the necessary consequences of their doctrines ; whence it is con- cluded that, although they may be sincere in their arguments, they are, at the best, the victims of a self-deception, inasmuch as their conduct and their practical rules are a perpetual denial of their theories. Utilitarians and evolutionists often try to meet these attacks by vain efforts to deny the logical and scien- tific validity of the conclusions drawn from their premises by their opponents. These efforts, I believe, have always been, and are doomed to be, entirely fruitless. But it will be asked: If you accept the consequences, why do you not act accordingly? This is the real point at issue, and the real essence of all the 'pious' arguments. The answer is, I think, to be found in those psychological laws I have repeatedly referred to, and on which I must now dwell a little more at length. Far from being an indivisible unity, mind is the function of a complex material system, capa- ble of responding in different manners to the action of dif- ferent stimuli, and whose plasticity makes it susceptible of being variously moulded and thus becoming more or less adapted to special reactions. The repetition of a particular reaction caus- ing a particular mental state finally brings about a permanent change of organization, and may be said to form a new and stable mechanism, which, at the same time that it responds more easily, sometimes ' automatically,' or unconsciously, to the action of the organizing stimulus, displays the further pecu- liarity, which may be called psychological inertia, of opposing, or being non-responsive to, stimuli of an opposite nature. In order to make the organism invariably responsive to other kinds of stimuli, the nervous system must be remoulded ; and it is obvious that this remnoulding requires more or less time, accord- ing as the change wrought before has become more or less stable or permanent, - this stability being, as a general rule, propor- tional to the strength and duration, or frequency, of the reaction</page><page sequence="21">No. 4.] MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. 391 from which it arose. It is to be noticed that a stimulus which originally caused a judgment and a corresponding feeling, finally ends by producing the feeling directly, even if the judg- ment no longer rises in consciousness. In this case the organ- ized feeling is said to owe its origin to an association of ideas. But it by no means follows that, on discovering this associa- tion, and on forming new judgments tending to produce a different feeling, we have the power to annihilate the old feel- ing at once, or that the old feeling will suddenly disappear; for a feeling which has become organized in the nervous centres can only be displaced by a contrary feeling, and, although the latter may temporarily be experienced, and will finally conquer the former, the old feeling will be the victor at first, owing to its greater stability; and, before it is definitively displaced, the new feeling itself must be permanently organ- ized. We may thus have two different and conflicting ' mental areas.' While we are removed from the impressions produced by a certain order of facts, we may judge in a certain manner, and feel accordingly; but once we are brought to the test, and submitted to the direct action of those agents to which our system is accustomed to respond in a peculiar manner, our judgment, in many cases, forsakes us, and the old feelings, inevitably excited, reassert themselves. It is not, however, that we change our opinions or our views, or that our doctrines are surrendered and the legitimacy of the opposite doctrines recog- nized; the real fact is that judgment and discrimination cease, and are, so to speak, eclipsed by the strong rays of the old flame. Of this we have familiar instances in what theologians call 'yielding to temptation'; and, as we are able, in some cases, to resist the allurements of ' temptation,' so are we capable of controlling our feelings (besides our actions), when they are not very intense. If, by what is termed ' an effort of the will,' we keep our theoretical conclusions present in con- sciousness, we may succeed, even if only momentarily, in look- ing with moral indifference on the most heinous crimes (I speak from a determinist point of view); and, were it possible to per- sist in this strained state of mind, the current moral feeling</page><page sequence="22">392 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. would not assert itself. The effort, however, owing to the insta- bility of all new psychical states (and this instability itself is what constitutes the effort), cannot usually be maintained; there is something like exhaustion brought about by the exceptional tension of the mind ; the system relapses into its habitual condition, and the habitual emotion ensues of neces- sity. But we may be certain that, by the continued application of this process, the feelings corresponding to the new judg- ments will finally cause a radical change in the nervous system, and, by becoming organized, take the place of the antagonistic feelings. It is not necessary for me to dwell at length on the obvious application of these principles to the moral feelings. While he who holds the naturalistic or monistic view of the universe, and who recognizes the fatalism of all human actions, and the selfish instincts as their final spring, must accept the undeniable consequences of his philosophy, he may with truth say that these consequences, although theoretically correct, cannot, as a general rule, be expected to become ordinary practice in the course of a lifetime, or even of a few generations, because of the automatical protests of an organism framed by the igno- rance and superstition of the past, and which we are unable to remould and reform at pleasure. But, on the other hand, he is bound to admit, I believe, that, as the world moves on, all moral feelings, being in opposition to scientific truths and phil- osophical conceptions, must vanish from consciousness, and conduct be governed by the simple feelings of pleasure and pain, of whatever kind; i.e., by the likes and dislikes of every individual (among which, of course, are to be included love, sympathy, fear of punishment, etc.). This change will probably not be produced exclusively by reasoning and distinct judg- ment, but to a great extent unconsciously, as almost all great changes occur, although reason does not fail, especially in the later stages of human development, to act as a very potent factor. There is one final remark I should like to make. The grow- ing sentiment of tolerance in religious and political matters is</page><page sequence="23">No. 4.] MORALITY THE LAST OF DOGMAS. 393 in reality a sort of movement towards what, in a certain sense, may be called moral indifference. And the important fact here to be noticed is, that tolerance comes from a recognition, although as yet imperfect, of the law of natural causation in the direction of mental phenomena a recognition requiring, as observed by Mr. Lecky,1 a highly developed intellect capa- ble of placing itself, while judging, at the point of view taken by the individual judged. When I condemn a man for acting in a certain manner or entertaining a certain opinion, I implicitly take it for granted that his mental capacities and conditions are, and must be, the same, or almost the same, as mine. Instead of placing myself in his case, I place him in my case, and my judgment of him finally takes the form: (PI would not act or think as he does." But further reflection will show that, his constitution not being identical with mine, his education and his habits having been different, and his motives of action being therefore different from mine, it is unreasonable to expect him to act or think otherwise than he does. To require that he should have feelings and ideas for whose existence there is no ground or material in his organism, would be to ask for an effect where the cause is wanting. This very obvious mode of reasoning has already produced its effects in the field of political and religious affairs, as I have before said; and it can scarcely fail to produce similar effects in the field of ethics; but, from the very nature of the ques- tion, this implies the disappearance of such feelings and con- ceptions as those of moral obligation, duty, and the like; for, so long as these exist, there cannot be internal tolerance, although there may be external tolerance, -internal tolerance being nothing but a state of moral indifference.2 As long as I believe my Mohammedan neighbor to be a monster of iniquity, revelling in the unspeakable depravity of a soul in open war 1History of European Morals, vol. I, ch. I, pp. 134-6 (Appleton's edition, i889). 2 We may accept Mr. Lecky's formula, " Men gain much in charity, but they lose something in zeal," substituting 'tolerance' for 'charity,' and 'morality,' or ' moral feeling,' for ' zeal.' The intolerance and imperativeness of the moral feel- ings is, indeed, of a nature very similar to that of religious ' zeal,' which, with the increase of ' charity,' seems to be seriously threatened.</page><page sequence="24">394 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. with its Creator, I am a religious bigot, whatever my external acts may be. In the realm of ethics, most of us are still bigots; but it seems probable that our successors will not be animated by moral piety, nor bow in obedience before the imperative commands of the moral dogma.
