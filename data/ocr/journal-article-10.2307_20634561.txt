<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABORTION AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF HUMAN BIOLOGY By Anthony P. Power * Advances in biology emphasise the need for us to make a distinction between the dimensions of Man that are common to other species and those that are specifically human. Only by doing this can we rationally exercise the freedom of choice offered by modern science in a manner in accord with our nature. This paper examines abortion from this point of view. For billions of years the mute forces of nature on this planet fumbled round and eventually came up with the jackpot, Man. We are told that the first man wanted the knowledge to control these forces of nature to be dished up like an apple on a plate. He was thrown out of the Garden in stead. However in the thousands of years that followed, succeeding genera tions of men have sought this knowledge the hard way. The last generation has been supremely successful. The rate of growth of scientific knowledge is exponential, such that we have found out more about our universe in living memory than we have found out in all previous time.1 Knowledge and power involve freedom and responsibility. Man already has the technological mastery to "pacify the struggle for existence" and so to provide more than just the necessities of life for every man, women and child for a quality of life hitherto unknown on this planet.2 Savage self-interest on a personal, corporate and national level has prevented the attainment of this quality of life even within the over-developed nations, let alone the under-developed nations. Over-population, worsening national inequalities, over-consumption of irreplaceable resources, and irreversible pollution are the direct consequences of the mismanagement of modern science and technology. These developments have so far affected Man from the outside only. Advances in the biological sciences are rapidly bringing Man himself into the ambit of scientific control. The mysteries of life and death and repro duction are well on the way towards being understood and hence con trolled. How will Man fare with this new freedom and responsibility? The beginnings of modern science caused a "metaphysical shudder" and a "failure of nerve" in the seventeenth century society, yet science then and today is as a cracker to a hydrogen bomb.3 4 This and Man's past record are enough to make many writers pessimistic. * Department of History of Science and Technology, University of Papua and New Guinea.

Apparently it is not in human nature to consider making major social adjustments before the shoe actually pinches: indeed, it often has to go on pinching a long time before inertia and vested interest are overcome." 5 We are now faced with the opportunity of existentially deciding our own pattern of life, our only limitations being those imposed by our reason. Increasingly, the biological determinism of the past will be seen as an intolerable constraint. New areas of freedom will have to be marked out and we will be given the choice to retain the old biologically deter mined pattern of behaviour or to modify it. Confronted by this challenge many prefer not to think about it, others want to proscribe it, asserting that to alter or create or control his biological substrate is beyond the charter given to Man as a creature. He is permitted to learn and understand but only in order to help live according to his "already determined nature". In reiterating the condemnation of contra ception the Pope takes such a stand.6 Science will progress and blanket prohibitions are bound to fail. The imperatives lie with moral philosophers to prepare mankind for inevitable developments. Abortion is a philosophical test case because it raises many of the issues that are likely to arise when, in the ordering of our human affairs we begin to make the distinction between the determined workings of the forces of nature and the ordering of such forces by the reasoned will of Man. If it can be shown that we can argue reasonably for the exercise of this control over nature, even in regard to our own biology, then there will be a way out of the impasse created by the present irrele vancy of traditional morality, which regards as sacrosanct what can only be described as the bioloically determined side of our nature. The very real possibility of Man's almost complete mastery over his own biological substrate by perfecting such things as brain transplants, fertilization and embryonic culture bypassing the womb, and genetic engineering helps us distinguish those dimensions of ourselves we have basically in common with other species from those elements that are specifically human.7 I shall argue for a lowering of the threshold of the human without impair ing the humanity. In the latter part of this paper I shall emphasise the specifically human aspects of our reproduction. In my analysis I hope to show that the failure to make this distinction makes traditional moral philosophy impotent and irrational as it demands an arbitrary halt to Man's evolution. This evolution is characterized by an ever increasing inter play between the inquisitive and creative intellect of man and the forces of nature. There is no need to call an arbitrary halt to this process as there is an inbuilt upper limit set by nature itself in the finite capacity of the human intellect. 5</page><page sequence="3">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, JUNE, 1973 Morals Follow Mores Abortion has been practised by mankind throughout recorded history, and probably as long as man has been man and felt the need for control measures on his population growth. His reproductive customs are inter dependent with his system of production as the success of both these deter mines the survival of man as a species. The hunter-gatherer's control was brutal and effective. Primitive agricultural societies controlled their popu lation by many methods including sex taboos, contraception, abortion, infanticide, and other indirect methods. Not being addicted to western man's rationalism he didn't need a justifying moral philosophy. Abortion in some modern societies is being used as one response to the population explosion caused by the increasing efficiency of disease control and food production. Yet today many moral theologians and people in general are vehemently opposed to abortion. I attempt to examine some of the reasons for this opposition. Christianity has been largely responsible for shaping western man's view of himself. This fact must be kept in mind in the present analysis. Concepts from Christian theology have greatly influenced Christian moral philo sophy, for example, the brotherhood and hence the dignity and equality of man based on the fatherhood of God. In their attempt to understand the historical phenomenon of revelation, Christians in different centuries and cultures have employed the philosophical expertise at their disposal. Man's intellectual and spiritual development is an on-going process related to his social, political and economic life and hence must not be tied to the forms of the past. Thus what in the past may have appeared to be moral dilemmas can and must be re-examined in the light of new know ledge and new life situations. Some institutional religions today are attempt ing to impose moral patterns which have been derived from another time, another place, and often another people. The growing divergence between the imposed morals and actual mores is not necessarily evidence that modern man is becoming degenerate but rather that he has outgrown the previous morals. Christianity attempts to teach us that the one unalterable basis for all morality is interpersonal love. History teaches that this love must find a pattern of expression peculiar to each age, and place, and people. Modern thinkers must find today's pattern. Fetus?Person or Not? The main philosophical and theological question involved in the abortion debate is whether the fetus is a person or not. Does it have a body and soul? Is it human? The basis for the rejection of abortion rests on the assumption that the fetus is a human person and thus is a proper subject of human rights, including the most fundamental right of all, the right to life itself. Most people agree that considered by itself there may be some grounds for abortion, for example, in the case of incest and rape. Yet even in these 6</page><page sequence="4">ABORTION cases some moralists do not permit it since evil cannot be done when good may ensue. Applying the principle of the double effect, that is, a bad side-effect of a basically good act can be tolerated, moralists have been able to justify cases of clinical abortion for ectopic gestation and uterine cancer. How ever these account for only a small number of actual abortions and so the question of the morality of abortion, endemic in many modern socie ties, remains a moral dilemma. I challenge the assumption that the fetus is a person as I adopt the view that a person is essentially a social creature which a fetus is not. Nor can it be since it lacks the biological maturity and, being in the womb, the physical opportunity for the sensory exchanges necessary for the de velopment of personality. Under the following heads I critically examine the thought patterns and categories that override the set formulae of traditional moralists and then attempt to create a new point of departure for the enquiry into abortion: the natural law; the philosophical error of dualism; restrictions on God; science and the soul; misuse of notions of Potency and Act; the place of emotions; traditional attitudes to life; an existential view of person. The natural law? Man's reason is part of his nature The fundamental opposition to the thesis that Man is permitted to go beyond biological determinism to create a life for himself comes from an inadequate understanding of the Natural Law. Traditional moralists hold that man has a God-given, hence immutable nature. By applying the concept of law by analogy to man's nature they derive the natural law, which is seen as a necessary implication for behaviour deduced from this nature, for example incest taboos, monogamy, and opposition to contra ception and abortion. As regards the first two, anthropological and socio logical studies have shown that this same immutable nature has been able to produce a great variety of different behaviour patterns. As regards the second two, we have many examples of their common practice which seem to be regarded as essential in certain circumstances for the very sur vival of the species. For example, some New Guinean tribes, still retain ing a proportion of migration and hunting in their life pattern, of necessity had to limit number of children to one or two. By contrast the Japanese, a modern civilized non-western people have extensively used abortion in their population control programme. It seems strange that something claimed to be so completely opposed to an immutable nature could have 7</page><page sequence="5">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, JUNE, 1973 been used so extensively and of necessity to maintain the species of that nature. The protagonists of the Natural Law understood in this sense are the first to uphold the thesis that Man is not just the same as the other animals, maintaining that he is a rational creature endowed with free will and intel lect and therefore morally responsible for his actions. This view poses some difficulties because this rational nature, by its very definition, is not able to be contained within any static concept, thus it seems that some kind of existential understanding of man is required. The intellectual creativity of man is continually stretching and challenging our understand ing of ourselves. It is not that man's nature is changing but that man's nature contains an indeterminate element. Thus I contend that it is possible to accept some kind of idea of man's nature since such a view includes the fact that man is rational. His reason is just as natural as his body; it is not a conditional afterthought but an integral part, so that it is not possible to make one set of rules for man's body and another for his mind. Most of man's evolutionary history was shared with the rest of living things during which time the pre-hominid ancestral chain was passively developed. However since Homo sapiens has emerged he has had a hand in his own development. Today when he is able to assume a much more active role some would have it all stop and opine that man should cede the full use of his mind and sink back into biological determinism or a supposedly rational accommodation to his biologically determined substrate. Such an attitude tends to deny what is specifically human in man and reduces him to the level of the other animals. The philosophical error of dualism As indicated above I accept the time honoured definition that 'Man is a rational animaP and that this reflects his God-given nature. However I insist that there is to be no great and false dichotomy forced between the two parts of this definition. Most of the discussions regarding man's nature and the natural law result in some form of unacceptable dualism. Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, and Descartes are a few of the thinkers who have grappled with some form of the mind-body, body-soul, matter-spirit, animal-person problem but I don't think that a satisfactory understanding has been achieved yet. Some thinkers have tried to avoid the dualism of Plato and Descartes by pursuing some form of Aristotelian hylomorphism, yet in the application of their findings on this question to related problems they always seem to fall over the razor's edge into dualism. I am referring to such problems presented in terms of "the existence of the soul", "Im mortality and final resurrection", "relationship of the individual to the Creator" to name a few. Many opt for some form of dualism as the most satisfactory answer to these questions. We read phrases like "the infusion of the soul" into the 8</page><page sequence="6">ABORTION fertilized zygote or into the three-month or six-month or whatever aged fetus to make the human person. Unfortunately the mediaeval debate did not solve these puzzles and it seems that in dualistic terms they are in soluble. Modern philosophy8 shows quite clearly that there is an inescapable problem in the dualistic concept of the body-soul, stemming from what are now seen to be the initial category mistakes, matter and spirit. Our concept of matter comes from our immediate sensory experience. On the other hand we derive a concept of spirit by denying it all the attributes we normally give to matter. This results in a dichotomy we can never overcome without ruining our basic categories. If we can't join the two again we can't have man, the body-spirit composite. That we have a problem in understanding Man's spiritual nature should not bother us unduly?there are many other problems just as elusive?in fact, science is constructed on a number of them. The ordinary concept of matter whose primary property is extension is entirely unintelligible,9 yet what we know as matter we all agree to be extended and we manage to manipulate it without much trouble. Physics is replete with such problems, e.g. energy, matter, force etc., yet man has managed to rocket to the moon. Ensoulment of the embryo Though modern theologians have outgrown the crude anthropomorphism implicit in the idea of the infusion of the newly created soul into the embryo, such ideas are still current in less well informed discussions on abortion. Perhaps it is worth pointing out that this view contains much that is parallel to the pre-evolutionary theory of special creation where God is made to intervene in different epochs to keep creating the different species. Science and the soul The science of cybernetics sees Man's mind or soul as some kind of epi-phenomenon essentially tied to our bio-chemical substrate. Psycho chemical transfers such as the one between the brain and the pituitary gland relating to human fertility show the intimate connection between what we call our psyche and our body. Such evidence does nothing to destroy belief in man's spiritual nature; it merely indicates that we are drawing nearer to the limit problem that seems to be imposed on a study of our own self-consciousness when we become the object being studied, the subject studying and the means by which the study is made. At the moment we seem to be more capable of saying what we are not rather than what we are. I don't think that this is a cause for alarm as our whole history as a species only occupies 1/13 billionth of the history of the universe?we may have plenty of time yet.10 9</page><page sequence="7">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, JUNE, 1973 Misuse of potency and act?the ontological slippery-dip Supporters of the fetus-person position quite often are so at the cost of committing a serious philosophical error by misusing the notions of potency and act. The error is the product of essentialist thinking in which existence is something that can be tacked-on to some essence to make it an actual existing thing. This places a static and artificial distinction at the very heart of every existing thing. The essence of something is its potency for being so that when existence is tacked-on it becomes act, a being. With regard to abortion such a view looks at the fetus as a human essence since it potentially is a person. So far so good. The argument goes one step further to claim that because a fetus potentially is (i.e. may become) a person that in fact it must be accorded the rights of a person and hence to abort it is "murder". Existentialist thinking on the other hand says that the fetus is a fetus and it may become a person providing that all the conditions required for a human person are supplied. To apply the word "person" to the fetus makes nonsense of our customary use of the word, since the primary characteristic of a person is the capacity for interpersonal exchange. To say that the fetus is a person is to take an ontological back-slide from "act" ("person"?something actually existing) into "potency" ("fetus"?having the potential to be something other i.e. a person), endowing the potency with the value of act. But a thing cannot be in potency and act in regard to the same thing at the same time. Thus it is false to argue that it is a. person because it potentially is a person. To argue that because a fetus is a potential person it must be accorded the rights of a person is in fact to say that the fetus is a person, with a right to life, for only in a person can such basic and inalienable rights reside. Two analogies will illustrate this kind of error: a. Some lovely little children turn out to be murderers when they grow up. Take "X" for example. When he was playing next door "X" potentially was a murderer and ten years later did in fact turn out to be a killer but at that time he was not in fact a murderer but a loveable little child and was treated as such. b. Some English youths holidaying in Germany before the last war probably enjoyed the company of close German friends, yet they were potential enemies who later fought and killed each other. At the time of the holiday they were actually friends though poten tially enemies. This error involves many in emotional but irrational responses to abor tion. For example: (1) In contemplating the loss of a fetus some parents project back on to the fetus all the not yet experienced love, care, reward and sacrifice associated with bringing up the child though this is properly associated with the young developing person after birth has taken place. 10</page><page sequence="8">ABORTION (2) Another example is the love often lavished on an unwanted child as if to make up for the guilt felt in not wanting him. Of course, this did not really occur at all since it was first the idea of the child, then perhaps the pregnancy etc. that was not wanted. The person that did not then exist was not rejected. Later when the person of the new child developed he was accepted and loved. (3) Often personnel associated with the abortion operation, especially those doctors and nurses Who are anti-abortion, have been known to make some rather lurid statements about the "dismembering of the little person piece by piece." Once again the backward projection is obvious, even considering a late abortion. Society should be so organized that such late abortions are rarely required. An aesthetic solution to this type of objection is presently avail able in the improved technology of abortion at the early stages. Soon the self administered abortion pill may be available. (4) The psychic trauma suffered by many women who have abor tions is caused by personal guilt aggravated by the shame heaped on by social opprobrium. To my mind both of these are responses to the same erroneous social conditioning. It follows that a more enlightened society would make recovery easier or perhaps avoid the trauma completely. Emotions are a very real and valuable part of us and I am not suggest ing that rationalism should remove them from our lives. Sometimes it is necessary momentarily to set emotions aside in order that we might think more clearly. Bertrand Russell is a good exponent of this kind of thinking in "Marriage and Morals". The place of emotions? Emotion plays a great part in the relationship between mother and the future child. A woman bears a fetus in her womb for several months. It develops from a physical discomfort into a sizeable kicking, moving, tan gible object that she gets to know as an independent part of herself. Upon this situation is based the beginnings of the strong relationship that develops later between mother and child. This strong relationship can be positive or negative, for different people react differently to the same situation. For some the relationship is perpetually tinged with resentment, just as when men endure difficult conditions together, such as prison camps or forced marches, some of them develop tremendously strong bonds of love and friendship while others can only curse the things that brought them together and they bear only hatred for their companions. The fact that women bear the developing organism in the womb is not biologically unique, because many other species do it; nor is it an inexor able situation; nor does it have any intrinsic value in itself. This emotion is tremendously important in the present situation for many reasons and it 11</page><page sequence="9">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, JUNE, 1973 may be one of the reasons why the artificial womb may never be accepted, though the thinking on this could change once the technology offered real choices. The arduous nature of pregnancy and childbirth is nowhere denied but it is worth noting that the only value in enduring the arduous is when it is necessary for the good of others. Reproduction remains a fundamental and central point in most people's lives and it is richly imbued with emotions. Indeed it is the only high point in some people's lives. It can be taken as a measure of the depriva tion suffered by many people, e.g. underprivileged in India, that life offers them so little in the way of opportunity that they reconcile themselves to their condition, nobly sacrificing their all in the hope that their spark of life will have a better chance in their children. Traditional attitudes to life Primitive notions of "reverence for life" along with such concepts as "vital principle" take a long time to die out even in this scientific age. It is argued that what is termed a devaluation of sub-human life may lead to a lack of respect for human life. Whether this is true or not, any kind of a rational reverence for life must recognise the built-in anthropomor phism in the way humans relate to other living things. This again is an example of the dangers of the ontological slippery-dip when values and relations proper to man are extended and projected subconsciously to animals. Rationally speaking, the wonder accorded a physico-chemical biological machine, that is, a living thing, is no less appropriately applied to some beautifully integrated dynamic non-living object such as an atom. The life-value given to a cat or a dog is given just as rationally to a bacterium though for obvious reasons most people find it easier to relate to the higher forms of life because these animals respond in ways to which we can correspond and therefore relate. Scientific rationalism does not in any way reduce the wonder for nature, if anything it increases it. As stated before in this paper scientific rationalism can best help us by focusing our attention on the wonder of the specifically human aspects of ourselves. An existential view of person The question may still be asked, when does a fetus become a person. As has already been mentioned, one of the main bugbears associated with moral philosophy in the past is its "essentialist" foundations. That is, it has a complete world picture or system of categories of well defined objects or "essences" which can be related to existence to give actual things. The most fundamental example is the distinction between essence and existence in all things except God. An "existentialist" philosophy on the other hand avoids this distinction and requires that part of the basic concept of any real thing is its existence. The existence of an existing thing is not just an 12</page><page sequence="10">ABORTION aspect of the thing that can be apprehended but it is the on-going develop ment and acting-out of the being of the thing. Thus the being of a thing cannot be frozen and encapsulated into an essentialist concept. We must have such concepts for convenience but we must recognize that they are more perceptions of reality than reality itself. This kind of thinking applies more to persons than to any other object of our experience, because of the built-in existential indefinability of an individual existing person. Essentialists may argue that the way is now open for complete arbitrari ness in dealing with persons and their rights. This does not follow at all. Firstly, no one is suggesting the abdication of the use of reason in the ordering of our human affairs. Secondly, society already recognises several types of things about the development of persons though there are no in fallible ontological guidelines indicating the person's stage of development. Some psychologists do attempt ontogenic classification based on a biological notion of function. Society deems it right to recognize and even legislate for these differences. For example, we talk of a child reaching "the age of reason" which is often arbitrarily set at seven years. While it is not unreasonable to make such a division in a child's development, in the present day children's minds are being activated much earlier. Secondly, the less the essentialist moralists have sway over society the less such an artificial division is needed. I am referring to the absurd practice of condi tioning children to their moral responsibility by teachng them all the pos sible "sins" that they must be on the lookout for when they examine their conscience. Thankfully this attitude is on the way out. A point worth mentioning in passing is that the idea of reaching "the age of reason" implies that this reason, which is held to be the specific difference keeping us apart from the animals, is in some way absent or imperfect in the child before. Does this affect the child's qualifications for being a human person? Another example is the recognition of a difference in the responsibility for crime by the operation of children's courts. When a young person is twenty-one he is supposed to be a mature adult. Society is now reacting to changing circumstances as in many places the adult age has been lowered to eighteen. Thus society by these rational though arbitrary lines of de markation has managed to recognize the development of persons without the aid of clear ontological guideposts. An analysis of the existential development of what we call a person will help show that there is a deal of room for arbitrariness and the use of reason. The process by which new human life comes into the world was once termed procreation. People use this word still but they don't know what it means anymore. It is an essentially religious word coming from the idea of man co-operating with God in the creation of a new human individual; God supplying the newly created soul. Life, of course, does not begin again, and new people do not really have new life. It is more like the flame of a fire being taken here and there from an already burning fire. So-called primitive societies retain a sense of the wonder of 13</page><page sequence="11">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, JUNE, 1973 this continuity of life in their constant relationship with their ancestors. Western society, perhaps because of the rapidity of change, tends to see each generation as unique?a fire from a new match and a new box. By the wonder of meiosis and fusion of sex cells we have a new recipe of life mixed from the old still living ingredients. This very mixing process, called fertilization, is itself a continum of diverse activities which seem to be sorted out only after several cell divisions of the zygote have occurred. Nature itself seems not to like clear cut distinctions. The new flame of life contains an individual integrity ensured by its inherited genetic complement. However, it needs to be nurtured from the undifferentiated stage to the almost completely differentiated newborn baby; in nature this is the speci alized environment of the mother's womb. Up till this stage nothing intrinsically human has occurred; the develop ment of a calf or a pup is the same. During gestation the fetus has been responding to all kinds of stimuli as a developing human organism but not in a specifically human fashion with some interplay of intellect and will. Some may argue that certain experiences that the fetus undergoes in the womb may affect its later life, especially with regard to its relationship with its mother, with the implication that if the effect shows up later in the behaviour of the person then it must have been responding as a person while still in the womb. Once again the ontological back-slide! Any relationships at this stage exist only in the mind of the mother, that is, it is one way. All this argument really does is to suggest that the fetus should have the best possible environment in which to develop. It is even possible that certain attitudes of the mother to the child can have a psycho-chemical carryover to the child for good or ill, though such effects would be difficult to prove beyond doubt due to the present impossibility of providing any control group, and secondly, because of the difficulties in distinguishing such effects from post-natal responses. In any case the fetus is not responding in a specifically human way but merely passively to stimuli. In fact, any experience of the developing organism has the potential for affecting its later life, but in the case of the developing human organism it is illogical to argue that if such experiences can affect the future person then the fetus must have been responding as a person. Gaining its gene complement at the single diploid cell stage after fertilization greatly affects the life of the fetus and later as a person directly and indirectly but this can't argue that it is a person then. All one can say is that the process of fertilization takes place in order that the new organism could be at all. Positive Versus Negative Abortion The point of arguing that the whole of conception and pregnancy and birth contain nothing that is specifically and essentially human is to high light the very important reality that what is essentially and specifically human in the making of a new human person begins after birth when, hopefully, the infant moves into a "love-womb" in which it starts to lay down the 14</page><page sequence="12">ABORTION cognitive and affective experience necessary for it to respond to other already existing persons so that it may become one itself. That is, it begins to learn to know and to love. There is a beautiful parallel here. Initially some of the very life of the parents is given in the sex cells to produce the "new" life. Later the love and knowledge of the parents is given to continue the creative process in making a new person. There is no conclusive evidence of what would happen if a human off spring were raised in complete isolation from human beings. There is a suspicion that to attempt to raise a baby in the laboratory in complete isolation would fail as the human offspring may need love in order to survive at all. If it did survive then it would probably be a human-like animal. So-called feral children have been kept alive in captivity but even in the apparently well authenticated and documented cases the feral habits were barely changed. They could even have been sub-normal in the first place.11 While our knowledge of what might happen to human offspring raised after birth separated from humans is very imperfect, our knowledge of the raising of human offspring raised after birth with other human beings is very considerable. The importance of the "love-womb" cannot be over emphasised, though of course it may take many forms, The "love" situa tion so important in the learning process has been well studied, including work with the natural mother and surrogate figures in orphanages, kibbut zim and Russian creches. In the Trobriand society for instance some child ren are raised from a very early age in the home of their maternal uncle. These children are indeed fortunate for their extended "love-womb" em braces at least four people and the child develops strong bonds with all of these. Thus it is worth taking time to examine the kinds of conditions that should be established before the reproduction of new human life is under taken. In our present social situation the "love-womb" is normally pro vided by the persons of the child's parents. In the parental husband-wife system several basic conditions are assumed. (i) It is assumed, ideally, that between parents there is a love rela tionship that will provide the love environment (love-womb) for any developing child that may come to the marriage. (ii) The parents implicitly, or more commonly today, explicitly choose to have a child and by so doing they opt for all the commitments of the two gestations. Once committed to this "child-programme" they don't have to make another decision about it and normally none is required. The area of freedom given to man in this is very important because, unlike most other species, man can now control his fecundity. In the past he could do this though with much more difficulty and much less success; he was also subject to external controls such as famine and epidemics. 15</page><page sequence="13">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, JUNE, 1973 Modern science has provided what some call "death control" at one end of the life cycle and now at the beginning of the life cycle science is providing an extent of control hitherto unknown. So we have a clear case of technology highlighting a moral issue. Even if there were a great demand for more people to populate the earth and help in the survival of the species the present possibility of exercising free dom would still have emphasised the necessity of a re-examination of our attitudes to procreation. Man should act in a rational and free way and his actions should not be biologically determined. Thus I am saying that it is right and proper for men to be free and that it is a wonder that philo sophers can't appreciate that this stage of development has taken all of Man's history as a species up to our own day to achieve and thus it is something to treasure and plan and educate for. The very serious risk of overpopulation, over exploitation of irreplaceable resources, and planet wide pollution of a dozen types indicates that this degree of procreative control is indeed timely. Oddly enough unless we can manage to foster a sense of social responsibility in the exercise of this freedom this newly won freedom itself may be eroded by State controls. We may have to get a licence to have a child since a marriage licence may not automatically give that privilege. Other factors are involved in the new dimensions of choice involved in procreation. (i) When all the implicit and explicit conditions of a "child-programme" have been posited, i.e. when people after due consideration have decided to have a child, they are not normally called on to make any decisions about continuing their initial commitment. However, once again due to the advance of modern medical science and technology, it may be pre dicted that due to some mischance the fetus is abnormal. The malfunc tioning may be caused by some genetic abnormality or some disease or a wrongly administered drug. The potential parents may be called upon to reconsider their commitment to this particular "child-programme" and advised to try again in which case if they agree the pregnancy would be terminated immediately, assuming of course there would be no great danger to the mother. (ii) Circumstances can arise where there is perhaps an even greater claim to the freedom to exercise rational control over procreation. In these cases there is no implicit or explicit positing of the conditions of the "child-programme", in fact just the very opposite. It is in these situations that the question of abortion most commonly arises today. For example in the case of rape, or incest, many cases of unmarried girls, and further unwanted pregnancies in marriage. It seems that society should ensure that no children be born under such circumstances since the condi tions required for normal development are by the nature of the circum stances ruled out of the question. No child can choose his own parents so those in society responsible for choosing to have a child should see that 16</page><page sequence="14">ABORTION the conditions that they reasonably would have demanded in their own case, were they given the choice, apply in every case. The responsibilities here lie with individuals and with society in general. At the moment there is much pressure from society in the way of laws, opprobrium, and family pressures, financial pressures and extortion, all forcing the continuation of the "child-programmes" where they were never intended and this tends to maximise human unhappiness. A rational approach to the question should tend in the opposite direction. Thus it becomes evident that a society that really cares about the welfare of every child and mother should permit, facilitate, and even counsel abortion in certain circumstances. Such a society could well produce a population more respectful for the act of begetting itself than less (less is usually posited as the outcome). It could become more of a privilege and a responsibility to produce a child rather than less. This could be termed positive abortion motivated by love and selflessness as distinct from negative abortion in which opponents of abortion often impute mo* tives of fear and selfishness. The commonplace existence of abortion in a society does not necesarily indicate a lowering of human values and could indicate exactly the opposite. It would be a society where people only had children out of love and where they had the opportunity to raise them in an atmosphere of love.
