<plain_text><page sequence="1">Traditions Past and Present: Allen McCartney and the Izembek Phase of the Western Alaska Peninsula Herbert D. G. Maschner Introduction Abstract. In 1971 Allen McCartney, together with Nancy McCartney and Michael Yarborough, conducted the first archaeological investigations on the lower Alaska Peninsula. The goal of their research was to investigate the boundary zone between the Aleut of the Aleutian Islands and western Peninsula, and the Yupik/Alutiiq peoples to the northeast. Excavating at three sites, McCartney and crew found the remains of villages dating to approximately A.D. 1000 that shared a particular type of projectile that became known as the Izembek Point, as well as a suite of more northern features such as polished slate, pottery, and a house with a stone foundation and a whale bone superstructure. McCartney defined the Izembek Phase based on these finds. Research conducted by Maschner over the last eleven years allows for an evaluation of the Izembek Phase and provides the necessary data to place McCartney's initial important discoveries in a broader context. Based on new dates and fieldwork, the Izembek Phase as McCartney defined it is now quite different from its original formulation. The lower Alaska Peninsula has been recognized as an important region for investigating the eastern frontier of the Aleut for many years (Dumond 1974, 1987a; Dumond, Conton, and Shields 1975; McCartney 1969, 1974) and it was the question of the Yup'ik/Aleut boundary that led Allen McCartney to conduct the first excavations in Izembek Lagoon in 1971 (McCartney 1974; Yarborough 1974). McCartney excavated at three sites along the southwest shore of Izembek Lagoon: XCB-001, a large village with dense concentrations of house depressions, XCB-002, a smaller site, and XCB-003, a site that included a large house with a collapsed whalebone superstructure. Given our understanding of radiocarbon dating at the time, it appeared that all three sites dated to approximately A.D. 900-1100 (McCartney 1974:64). The whale bone house was unique because is it was (and still is) the only whale bone house yet found in the Aleut region. In addition, this house form seemed to be Eskimo in origin and contained Eskimo style pottery from the Bering Sea. It also yielded an abundance of ground slate and a number of other characteristics that indicated a Bering Sea origin of the inhabitants of the house. McCartney defined the Izembek Phase (McCartney 1974:69) based on investigation of this house and related artifacts. The Izembek Phase was seen as technologically transitional between the Aleut region and the Bering Sea Eskimo region. Since few of the houses McCartney and his crew encountered appeared to be permanent structures, McCartney argued that they probably represented a seasonal settlement pattern, perhaps used in the Herbert D.

In the years following McCartney's initial sur- vey and excavations, a number of projects were undertaken. In 1979 Michael Yarborough led a United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) survey of portions of the Izembek Lagoon region and tested a number of sites (Klingler n.d.; Yarborough n.d.). In 1986 Dumond conducted a helicopter survey of part of the region in the process of creating a model of village locations for the USFWS (Dumond 1987b). From this survey he concluded that McCartney's seasonal settlement model for the lagoon systems was not justified given the abundant resources available in the area throughout the year. He particularly noted that the caribou and whale resources could probably sus- tain a year-round population (Dumond 1987b:41, see also 1995). This was similar to McCartney's reevaluation of the region where he argued in 1988 that the Alaska Peninsula lagoon systems might actually be "ecological hotspots." He suggested that the Bering Sea shore had a "punctuated coast subsistence settlement pattern" (McCartney 1988:46), and predicted that once more survey was done (McCartney 1988:47) a large number of sites might be found in the lagoons, with many "reflect- ing larger and politically more important settle- ments" (McCartney 1988:46). In 1988, archaeologists from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act project (BIA ANCSA) found that this was indeed the case, locating a number of extremely large village sites spanning the last 4,500 years (Cooper and Bartolini 1991; USBIA 1991). Also important was the recognition of a form of multi- chambered house with a central room ranging from 8 to 20 meters in length with one to 10 attached side rooms, usually from 1 to 3 meters in diameter. Termed "nucleus/satellite complexes" by the BIA investigators (USBIA 1991:63), and now dated to after A.D. 1100, these houses show a significant departure from all houses dating earlier that gener- ally are a single depression. Two other significant projects in the region require discussion. Between 1972 and 1984 Hiroaki and Atsuko Okada led excavations at the Hot Springs Village site in Port Moller to the north- east (Kotani 1980; A. Okada 1989; H. Okada 1980, 1997; H. Okada and A. Okada 1974 a,b 1989; Okada, Okada, and Kotani 1979; Okada et al. 1976, 1984, 1986). Following excavations by Weyer in the 1920s (1930) and by the joint Meiji University- University of Wisconsin project in 1960 (Workman 1966), a sequence now dated between 2000 B.C. and A.D. 8001 was defined (based on new dates, see Maschner in press). While a number of excel- lent preliminary reports were written, the final analysis is still in preparation. The second project is the Shumagin Island survey conducted by Johnson and Winslow (Johnson 1988, 1992; Johnson and Wilmerding 2001; Johnson and Winslow 1991; Winslow 1991). Nearly 40 sites of various functions and ages were identified on an active coastal landscape. Spanning the last 5,000 years, occupation of the Shumagins seems to be punctuated by periods of less intense occupation or abandonment. By the early 1990s, the Hot Springs site had been well known for decades, but the remainder of the western Peninsula was virtually unknown outside of McCartney's excavations and a few surveys. Thus many of the debates of McCartney and Dumond on the nature of the regional prehistory were tempered by a lack of data. Furthermore, there was some bias against the region as well. The first cause of bias is Veniaminov's ([1840] 1984) often quoted statement that there were few villages and people in this region at contact - the implica- tion being if this was a great place to live, there would have been people there. Archaeologists often assume that the ethnohistoric record shows the peak of cultural development and it is only recently that we have recognized that the past may have been much more complex than the ethno- graphic record leads us to believe. The second rea- son for bias is that most of the research on the archaeology of the eastern Aleut had been con- ducted in the Unalaska-Umnak region where dense shell middens produced spectacular finds. Some of the reasons these islands were investi- gated so intensively are logistical because access was relatively easy when compared with the rest of the region, other reasons are based in historical precedence since the region has been the subject of excavations for over 100 years. It was also consid- ered important because Russian writers implied that this region was the center of Aleut cultural development. Of course, the Aleut homeland is huge and there are only so many archaeologists, but the lack of research on the western peninsula is certainly a byproduct of the factors mentioned here.2 The Lower Alaska Peninsula Project grew out of a number of related events. The first was my association with Brian Hoffman, who came into my office one day to show me maps of several massive villages that he had worked on during the BIA ANCSA surveys. The second was my familiarity with Allen McCartney's seminal work in the region. So, when the third event occurred, a USFWS trip to Unimak Island to evaluate and test a number of eroding sites that were being collected</page><page sequence="3">McCartney's Izembek Excavations and Regional Prehistory 100 Arctic An thropology 4 1 :2 by local fisherman, the project was born. It was in the next year that Hoffman formulated his Ph.D. research efforts and continued his work on Unimak Island, while James Jordan, then a Ph.D. student in Geography, and I began a long-term collaboration on the tip of the peninsula. Ultimately, a number of grants from the National Science Foundation funded the work. Now, 11 field seasons later, the region has gone from one of the least known areas of Alaska to one where there is a fairly good understanding of the prehis- toric record, the coastal geomorphic history, and the paleoecological sequence. The focus of the early years of the project was on survey, geology, and paleoecology. In 1998, more extensive excavations were begun at a num- ber of sites, particularly at Russell Creek. These were followed by excavations at Adamagan in Morzhovoi Bay, and then at Ram's Creek in King Cove. The research designs, hypotheses, and results of these investigations are published else- where or will be in the near future and need not be reiterated here. But it should be noted that in all cases, we avoided the time periods initially investi- gated by McCartney because there was so little known about the rest of the sequence that redun- dancy did not seem the best use of resources. I now have enough data, I hope, to place McCartney's seminal work in a regional context that did not exist at the time of his research. Since the details of McCartney's Izembek excava- tions have been published (1974, 1984, 1988; Yarborough 1974), and many of the settlement, vil- lage, house, and technological details of the regional chronology as generated by the Lower Alaska Peninsula Project and Hoffman's Unimak excavations have been presented, there is no rea- son to reiterate them here (Gauthier 2003; Hoffman 1999, 2002; Jordan 2000, 2001; Jordan and Maschner 2000; Maschner 1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2000; Maschner and Bentley 2003; Maschner and Hoffman 2003; Maschner and Jordan 2001; Maschner and Reedy-Maschner 1998; Maschner et al. 1997). Rather, in this section I will highlight a number of important aspects of McCartney's dis- coveries and place them in the context of what I now know about the archaeology of the western Alaska Peninsula. Specifically, I will discuss house form and technology. First, however, a brief discus- sion of the radiocarbon dates at these sites is war- ranted. First, as will be shown below, two new AMS dates at IZMl (XCB-001) confirm dates secured by McCartney and firmly date this site. There is no question as to where this site falls in the regional chronology - somewhere in the early 1100s A.D. (Table 1). IZM2 (XCB-002) has a single date that is very close to those from XCB-001. Based on house form (discussed below) and the technology found there, this date is also accurate, but there might be an earlier occupation as well (see the discussion of pottery below). IZM3 (XCB-003) has always been difficult to evaluate for a series of reasons, but it should be noted that McCartney thought that the 390 Â± 95 uncalibrated date on wood was much too late, since there were a number of large roots and other more recent alder fragments in the upper stratigra- phy (I have seen this problem elsewhere in the region). He thought that the 1235 Â± 105 uncali- brated date was too old, partially based on the problems, just then being recognized, of dating marine mammal bone, and also because the 1005 Â± Table 1. Radiocarbon dates for the three sites excavated by Allen McCartney in 1991. Two of the dates were run in 1997 as part of the Lower Alaska Peninsula Project, two additional dates were run in 2003 at the request of Allen McCartney, the rest are from McCartney's 1974 publication.

As listed in Table 1, the 2-sigma cali- brated range of the wood date is A.D. 1300-1850. If we use the regional average reservoir effect as reported by Dumond and Griffin (2002) of approxi- mately 460 Â± 41 years, the whale bone date gives a calibrated 2-sigma range of A.D. 1345-1757. What if these two dates are correct and the single char- coal date is actually dating an earlier occupation? While working on this paper it became evident that a number of new radiocarbon dates from XCB-003 were required to make better sense of the overall sequence. If the house ended up dating to signifi- cantly later in the sequence, then the archaeology of the entire time period would need to be reevalu- ated. This turned out to be the case. Allen McCartney generously sent all of his Izembek mate- rials to my laboratory at Idaho State University, where I found a number of large charcoal samples from the hearth and roof- fall areas of the whale bone house. These were sent to Beta Analytic and the results are presented in Table 1. The whale bone house now dates between A.D. 1250 and A.D. 1400, clearly later than the other two sites. The important implications of this shift in time period will become obvious below. Perhaps the easiest site to reconcile with what is now known about the western Alaska Peninsula is McCartney's IZMl, now generally referred to as XCB-001. When the site was first investigated, McCartney and his crew identified a number of depressions, few of which appeared to be large houses. They recognized some very large depres- sions, but did not immediately identify these as cultural, thinking instead that they might be natu- ral or barrow pits. Nearly twenty years later the sig- nificance of XCB-001 was understood when BIA ANCSA archaeologists identified the depressions as nucleus-satellite houses.3 These houses are the archaeological version of those described in the Russian literature (see descriptions in Hoffman 2002). They consist of a large central depression with a roof entrance. The central room has up to 12 side rooms connected by entries or small passages to the main chamber. These side rooms were used for storage, sleeping, and at the end of their use, for burials. Around the outside edge of the main cham- ber is a low trench that served as a work and sitting area. This is exactly the sort of house that is shown in Webber's classic lithograph done during the Cook expedition. A 300 to 400 year old archaeological version of these houses was excavated by Hoffman on Unimak Island. He was able to clearly identify the side rooms and their entrances, as well as the sit- ting trenches on the outer edge of the main room. In addition, he was able to demonstrate the com- munal nature of life in these houses. He also showed that the central part of these houses con- tains many sub-floor storage pits and activity areas (1999, 2002). In the context of the Lower Alaska Peninsula Project, many of these houses were identified, some in a number of very large villages with 30 or more nucleus-satellite houses. The BIA crew work- ing at XCB-001 identified and mapped at least five of these houses, and several others that were likely of the same construction (USBIA 1991). In 1996 we revisited XCB-001 to collect charcoal to corrobo- rate McCartney's dating of the site. Two samples were collected from within one of the large houses. One came from the roof-fall layer and another from the underlying house floor. As can be seen in Table 1, the dates of the samples we collected are statisti- cally identical to those of McCartney. Figure 1 is a chart of all of the radiocarbon dates on the western Alaska Peninsula dating to the last 2,000 years and calibrated to a 2-sigma range. The dates that represent nucleus-satellite houses are dark bars, while dates on other types of features and houses are light bars. As can be seen in this chart, the large houses cluster into two groups, one about A.D. 1100-1250, and and another between about A.D. 1475-18004. Why the gap? All of the sites we have found that fall into the gap, which I termed the Big Lagoon Phase in earlier papers (Maschner 1999b; Jordan and Maschner 2000) but which now will be reinvented as McCartney's Izembek Phase given the new dates,5 are small (including the whalebone house), with from 1 to 3 round houses without side rooms. There clearly appears to have been a major disruption in settle- ment in the region for about 200 to 300 years. The spatial distribution of nucleus-satellite houses is also interesting. They occur on the Peninsula from Bear River (east of Port Moller) southwest to False Pass, and they are quite com- mon on Unimak Island. On the Pacific side of the Peninsula they occur in small numbers on both the Shumagin Islands and as large villages in the Sanak archipelago. West of Unimak Pass this form of nucleus-satellite house is not known, although the long-house version, as found at Reese Bay, is pres- ent (see discussion in McCartney and Veltre 2002). Thus, at least after A.D. 1100, a large culturally dis- tinct region can now be defined based on a particu- lar form of house shape and organization. However, houses of exactly the same form now occur in two different phases of Alaska Peninsula prehistory (Table 2), I will return to this topic below. At site XCB-002, a site only briefly investi- gated by McCartney and crew, he collected a few artifacts from a single excavation. This site was reinvestigated by the BIA ANCSA crew in 1988 and</page><page sequence="5">1 02 Arctic Anthropology 4 1 :2 Figure 1.

Note the bimodal distribution of nucleus-satellite houses, the distribution of Izembek Points, and the distribution of pottery finds. Table 2. Chronological Overview of the Western Alaska Peninsula. Morzhovoi Phase A.D. 1450-1800 Huge population increase. Massive nucleus-satellite houses with up to 300 m2 of floor area. Villages with &gt;25 of these houses. Izembek Points continue. No pottery, some polished slate. Small harpoons with off-center line holes. Some evidence of craft specialization (Hoffman 2002). Evidence of warfare because refuge/fortification rocks are in use. All major villages (n = 9) are on red salmon streams, which appear to be the focus of settlement throughout the region. Izembek Phase A.D. 1250-1475 Severe reduction in the regional population. Small houses and villages. No nucleus-satellite houses known. Izembek points continue. Movement of villages back to more open sea access locations, much less use of salmon streams for settlement. Time period of the whale bone house. Cape Glazenap Phase A.D. 1100-1250 Larger villages and the development of nucleus-satellite houses. Izembek points common, polished slate present. XCB-001 is the type site. Other sites known as well. Settlements are placed in locations for efficient access to marine, intertidal, and sockeye salmon resources. The transition from the Frosty Creek Phase to the Cape Glazenap Phase is fuzzy, with many overlapping features. When nucleus-satellite houses develop at some locations, the Frosty Creek Phase pattern of smaller villages and single- depression houses continues in other areas. This maybe cultural, or it may be a product of the calibration curve. Frosty Creek Phase A.D. 600-1100 Smaller villages and houses, similar to the Kinzarof Phase (but many more of them). Settlement shifts from 3,500 years of open coast access to an emphasis on pink and chum salmon streams. Rare pottery, more polished slate. Evidence of warfare - because refuge/fortification rocks are in use.</page><page sequence="6">Maschner: Allen McCartn ey and the Izem bek Ph ase 1 03 Table 2.

This phase may certainly be subdivided with further research on these early sites. was found to contain one of the nucleus-satellite type houses and a number of houses of different forms (USBIA 1991). The single date from this site (Table 1) is consistent with the dates from the Cape Glazenap Phase (Table 2), but also consistent with the succeeding Izembek Phase phase. The whale bone house excavated by McCartney and crew at XCB-003 is much more dif- ficult to integrate into the regional chronology. Constructed with a stone foundation and lower wall and a superstructure consisting of 34 large whale mandibles, this house has few parallels any- where in western Alaska. Throughout the western Alaska Peninsula region, it is common to find an occasional whale bone sticking up in a house depression, especially in villages less than 1000 years old. This usually entails one or two upright whale bone posts in one or two houses out of dozens or hundreds. McCartney's description of the density of surface whale bone evident when he first arrived at XCB-003 is astounding. How do we reconcile XCB-003 with the rest of the regional archaeology? After looking at over 7,500 surface depressions from across the western Alaska Peninsula, I can say with some confidence that McCartney's whale bone house is unique. Given his description of the density of whale bone visible on the surface, nothing else like it has been found. Over the course of eleven field seasons, we have excavated portions of at least 25 houses, Hoffman excavated portions of six others, and nearly 20 houses were partially excavated at the Hot Springs site by the Okadas. The whale bone house is the only one with any evidence of a stone wall, although stone walls dating 2,500 years ear- lier are found on Unalaska and Umnak (Richard Davis, personal communication). There is no plau- sible connection between those earlier walls and the whale bone house. Technology McCartney recovered two distinct artifact types, the Izembek point and the Fishtail point, from these three sites that help to place them in a regional context. He also found two distinct cate- gories of the artifacts, ground slate and pottery, which have temporal and spatial significance</page><page sequence="7">1 04 Arctic An thropology 4 1 :2 across the region. I will address all of these in turn. Pottery is an interesting aspect of XCB-003. This site produced the largest collection of pottery found anywhere in the region. We recovered a large ceramic body sherd at XCB-033 in Moffet Lagoon associated with a large slate knife and wood char- coal dating about 100 B.C. Yarborough's USFWS crew recovered a single fragment of pottery from XCB-040 in 1979 that has a 2-sigma calibrated range of A.D. 660 to 900 on an associated charcoal sample, and the BIA crew found (Hoffman, per- sonal communication), but did not collect, a pot- tery sherd at XCB-028 which dates, given the location on the site, sometime between A.D. 800 and 1100. McCartney also recovered a single frag- ment of pottery from XCB-002 (Yarborough 1974:87). To summarize, there is a single sherd dat- ing to about 2000 years ago, and a few scattered fragments are associated with dates covering the next 1200 years. But at XCB-003, the whale bone house, there are hundreds of sherds from a number of vessels. Most ceramics found east of the region, on Kodiak, and on the upper Peninsula, date to after A.D. 1100, the time period of the Thule- Koniag manifestations. The new dates from the site make it clear that these pottery fragments are con- temporaneous with similar developments to the east. Based on a preliminary and ongoing analysis of ceramic thin sections, all of the sherds recovered from the region appear to be Koniag related except for the single 2000 year old sherd from XCB-033, which, based on paste and temper, appears more Norton related. One of the hallmarks of the original Izembek Phase was the Izembek Point, which McCartney found in all three sites he excavated. The Izembek Point is a dart point with a long blade, a slightly contracting stem, a straight or sometimes convex base, and a distinctive tang separating the stem from the blade. Indeed, it was the presence of this point in all three excavations that led McCartney to place the sites in the same phase. With the original dates reported by McCart- ney, the Izembek Points at XCB-003 were the earliest known in the region. But the points are most common in all three phases after A.D. 1100 and if they were not present in the whale bone house, I would have argued that they co-occur with the nucleus-satellite houses. This time period is poorly known in the Port Moller region so it is unclear if their distribution extends that far north- east, and a review of the drawings in Johnson's report (1988) does not show any for the Shumagin Islands. But these projectiles are very common in the lower peninsula region and on Unimak Island, they are not known west of Unimak Pass and again, are another indicator that this was a specific subre- gion of Aleut culture in prehistory. With the new dating of the site, I can now firmly argue that the Izembek Point, as described by McCartney, is a temporal marker and is associated with the cultural developments that took place after A.D. 1100 or so. This point is found in most sites dating from A.D. 1100 to Russian contact. The fishtail point in the western Alaska Peninsula region is the hallmark of the Adamagan Phase, dating from 400 B.C. to A.D 100. These points are common at the site of Adamagan at the head of Morzhovoi Bay (Gauthier 2003) and they have been found in small numbers in 2,000-year- old contexts at four other sites in the project area. Other fishtail points are found in approximately 2,200- to 1,900-year-old contexts in the Shumagins (Johnson 1988), on Chirikof Island (Workman 1969), Chignik (Dumond 1992; Dumond, Henn, and Stuckenrath 1976) and at Hot Springs in Port Moller (Okada et al. 1982, 1984).6 How do we rec- oncile the above temporal distribution with the fact that McCartney found several fishtail points in the whale bone house dating almost 1300 years later? There are a number of possible scenarios that may answer this question. The first is that the fish- tail points from these various periods are not, in fact, the same kind of point at all. A number of scholars who have looked at both have seen signifi- cant differences between them, especially in the shape of the stem. Archaeologists have done almost no work in any site dating between A.D. 200 and A.D. 900, a huge gap in our regional knowledge of the lower Peninsula. But we do have the entire late component of the Hot Springs site for comparison which dates between A.D. 100 and A.D 800 (Maschner in press), and there are only two fish- tails, both dating about A.D. 100 - overlapping with the end of the Adamagan Phase. I have discussed this problem with McCart- ney a number of times, and he agrees that there may have been mixed deposits, especially be- cause the monumental construction effort that went into the whale bone house disturbed much of the surrounding deposit. Students in my laboratory have been analyzing all of the Izembek excavations in order to assist in the creation of a final report on the project. It has been noted that all of the fishtail points come from deposits described as "fill" in McCartney's field notes. These deposits are all out- side of the house construction. I think it possible that there was an earlier deposit that was heavily impacted by the construction of the whale bone house. Ground slate presents a wholly different prob- lem. The ground slate collection at the whale bone house is truly spectacular and there is nothing comparable to it in any collection in the region. Holland has argued that the extensive use of ground slate goes back at least to A.D. 700 on Akun Island (Holland 1992), and both Knechfs recent</page><page sequence="8">Returning to the Aleut-Eskimo Boundary Issue Maschner: Allen McCartney and the Izembek Phase 1 05 work on Unalaska (Knecht and Davis 2001; Knecht, Davis, and Carter 2001) and my Alaska Peninsula research, give ground slate about a 2,200-year his- tory.7 The fundamental difference between Holland's data and those of Knecht and Maschner, is that Holland argues for the manufacture of slate tools on Akun, while elsewhere they appear to be rare imports.8 Ground slate artifacts appear in the Alaska Peninsula region towards the end of the Adamagan Phase in small numbers, perhaps one artifact out of several hundred. This trend contin- ues through the Ram's Creek Phase and the late component at Hot Springs when slate is clearly present but again, rare. There is no evidence of pol- ished slate manufacture at any sites in the region, and many of the slate tools have been retouched along the cutting edges to give them a more chipped-stone or local appearance. This is a simi- lar pattern to that seen on the north side of the upper Alaska Peninsula where ground slate plays a minor role until after A.D. 1100 (Dumond 2003:27). Polished slate becomes very common after A.D. 1500, with numerous ulu-shaped knives, occasional projectiles and endblades, and rare evi- dence of manufacture, or at least rejuvenation. Dozens of ulus and slate fragments have been recovered from erosion surfaces at some of the sites on the north side of Unimak Island. Some are clearly imported, while others are made of local materials. However, in the middle of a rather coher- ent pattern is the whale bone house and its com- plete assemblage of slate tools and debris, with extensive evidence of slate tool manufacture. The pattern, observable over 2,000 years, of finding a rare polished blade in most sites contin- ues right through the Frosty Creek Phase, the Cape Glazenap Phase, and the Izembek Phase - occur- ring everywhere except in the whale bone house. This is worth worrying about for one critical rea- son. The polished slate assemblage at XCB-003 is not just similar to the ones associated with Dumond's Brooks River Camp Phase and Kukak Beach Phase, but in all ways it is the same assem- blage (2003). The similarities between artifacts from the Leader Creek site and XCB-003 are star- tling. In fact, I initially thought that McCartney's Figure 6 (b), and Dumond's Plate VII (a) and Plate VIII (f ) might be the same artifacts! At least four other slate endblade types are also found in all three phases. This observation is nothing new, however. McCartney recognized these same simi- larities 30 years ago (1974:72-73) and Dumond has mentioned them in a number of publications. The two upper peninsula phases are firmly dated between about A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1500- the time period for the rise of all late developments in the Eskimo region and the centuries when, at least to the northeast, we would truly expect to find a heavy use of slate and ceramics. With the new dat- ing of the whale bone house, these patterns are now contemporary, but the spatial context is still discor- dant with the regional chronology. The Aleut-Eskimo boundary issue is an important area of research and, while I have not addressed it in any detail in my other writings, I think a number of comments on the topic can now be made, given some of the patterns addressed in this paper. The first is the distribution of nucleus-satellite houses after A.D. 1100. None have been found northeast of the Bear River, the first big sockeye system east of Port Moller, and none have been found east of the Kupreanof Peninsula, just northeast of the Shumagin Islands. This distribution corresponds almost exactly to the historic boundary defined in the ethnohistoric literature (see Dumond 1974). Everything east of these areas after A.D. 1100 has much more polished slate and many more Koniag style houses than are found on the western Alaska Peninsula. In fact, houses and technology are probably fairly good indicators of the earlier prehistoric eth- nic boundaries in this region as well. As Aigner argued for Anangula (Aigner and Del Bene 1982), the Aleut-style house with a roof entrance appears to extend far back into prehistory. This is in con- trast with the tunnel style of entrance that has a long history on both the upper Alaska Peninsula and the Kodiak Archipelago (Dumond 1994; Jordan and Knecht 1988). Since no houses have been exca- vated on the north side of the peninsula between the Hot Springs site and the Ugashik River, and no houses have been excavated between the Shumagins and Kodiak on the south side, the eth- nic boundary defined by house architecture dating before A.D. 1100 has not been determined. But lithic technology might also be a good indicator of identity. There appears to have been a culturally defined and conscious attempt to distin- guish an "us versus them" ideal in technological production. To the east prior to A.D. 1100, peoples associated with the Kachemak Tradition made extensive use of polished slate (Clark 1982, 1992). On the north side of the peninsula, few of their late Norton contemporaries did (Dumond 1987c, 1988, 2000), and it was also quite rare to the west. Both Workman and Dumond (personal communications) have stated that some technological similarities (even actual artifact types) are shared by phases of the western Peninsula sequence, the Norton tradi- tion to the northeast, and the Kachemak tradition to the east. A major distinguishing characteristic, especially on the south side of the peninsula, is the line between some use of polished slate versus</page><page sequence="9">Fitting a Chronology of the Western Alaska Peninsula 1 06 Arctic An thropology 4 1 :2 basically no use of polished slate. If this is a truly important factor, then the boundary between the Aleut and Kachemak groups prior to A.D. 1100 was much further east, since the Chignik materials (Dumond 1992) and certainly the Chirikof Island collections (Workman 1969) would fall on the Aleut side of the boundary.9 But after A.D. 1100, this regional pattern changes in the Aleut area where there appears to have been a purposeful effort to manufacture only chipped stone. In many cases where polished items entered the western Alaska Peninsula, they were retouched along the margins to make them more local in appearance. If we look at the distribution of polished slate after A.D. 1100, then the boundary shifts west, to approximately that defined by both the nucleus- satellite houses and the historic linguistic data. A distinction must also be made to the west, however, because Unimak Pass, separating Unimak Island from the Krenitzen Islands, also seems to be a boundary between groups when one considers household organization, harpoon styles, and some aspects of the stone tool technology. For example, as already discussed, there are no peninsula style nucleus-satellite houses west of Unimak Pass. Also, none of the peninsula's important endblade types, such as the Russell Creek triangular endblade of the Russell Creek Phase (3500 B.P.), the fishtail point of the Adamagan Phase (400 B.C.-A.D. 100), the Ram's Creek arrow point of the Ram's Creek Phase (A.D. 100-600), or the Izembek point after A.D. 1100 are found there. At the same time, no long, bilateral and decorated harpoons in the Unalaska-Umnak style have been found any- where on the western Alaska Peninsula, and at present little evidence has been found of the later blade technologies as defined in Unalaska (Dumond and Knecht 2001; Knecht and Davis 2001; Knecht, Davis, and Carter 2001). Thus, we may be seeing a regional boundary within the broader category of Aleut prehistory as well as the ethnic boundaries that separated the Aleut from more Eskimo-like cultures to the east. How fixed were these boundaries, and how permeable? Returning again to XCB-003, although the house is unique in that it has a stone wall, a whale bone superstructure, a complete ground- slate men's toolkit, a complete ground-slate women's toolkit (both Eskimo style), and lots of pottery (again Eskimo style), it also has a complete Aleut-style chipped stone assemblage. Jokingly, McCartney and I imagined an Aleut bigman mar- ried a woman from the Bristol Bay region or Kodiak Island, who brought her own household technol- ogy with her, and was accompanied by a couple of brothers with their hunting technology. Given what is now known about the region as a whole, this might be a more likely explanation than any others I might come up with. There is an old adage in anthropology that one often marries those with whom one is most often in conflict. I have no other explanation for the whale bone house and its contents. The chronology I developed for the western Alaska Peninsula reflects the changing goals and agendas of the project as a whole. The first chronology was based solely on shifts in settlement patterns and house styles. By working with McCartney's and Hoffman's excavations, technology could be used in the definition of the later phases. However, I relied more on changing house form than any- thing else because houses seemed to change more quickly in this area than technology. Early and Late Izembek Phases were originally developed because it appeared that this was a millennium where settlement focused on pink and chum salmon streams, with a short disruption in the radiocarbon chronology about A.D. 750. Since McCartney's whale bone house originally fell into this time period, I kept the Izembek designation. These names have now been discarded and the Izembek Phase designation is now used in place of the Big Lagoon Phase designation, giving credit to McCartney's important discoveries and publica- tions (see Table 2). After the excavations at Russell Creek, I was able to incorporate some aspects of technology into the definition of at least one of the earlier phases. The large sample from Adamagan allowed me to define the Adamagan Phase, and the earlier component at Adamagan allowed me to characterize the later half of the Kinzarof Phase, which until now has been a placeholder between Russell Creek and Adamagan. The Moffet Phase is, at this point, defined as including everything earlier than Russell Creek, but noting the presence of polished slate in a well-dated context at one 4,400-year-old site. The new chronological placement of the whale bone house makes discussion of the last four phases interesting. If we were to use the Izembek Point as a defining marker of a phase, then every- thing from the Cape Glazenap Phase to historic contact, a time span of roughly 700 years, would be in the same phase. If we use house styles and set- tlement patterns, then my phase sequence holds. Perhaps the biggest problem in defining a chronological sequence for the last 1,400 years on the western Alaska Peninsula was fitting the whale bone house, with its unique stone and pottery assemblage, into the regional pattern. With the new dates, this is not a problem. The site fits perfectly into the Izembek Phase designation, the phase that splits the two periods of nucleus-satellite houses.</page><page sequence="10">Maschner: Allen McCartney and the Izembek Phase 1 07 This is a time period of decentralization on the lower Alaska Peninsula and perhaps even repre- sents a period in which there was an expansion of more easterly peoples into the region for a short time. Houses are small and appear in small clus- ters. There are no known large villages. The nucleus-satellite houses that were so common 100 years before, and which became so common 200 years later, are completely absent. There are so few sites and houses during this phase that I have often wondered if there was not a major population decline. A Few Concluding Comments I have always wondered how so many of the great Alaskan archaeologists ended up excavating where they did and how they so often ended up finding the most important site in a particular region. Examples of this pattern abound - Rainey at Point Hope, Giddings at Denbigh, Krusenstern and Onion Portage, Geist on St. Lawrence, and Laughlin at Anangula and Chaluka, to name a few. I recognize that many of these sites were already known, but how fortuitous that these seminal researchers chose, by educated instinct or instinc- tive serendipity, the sites that would become the most important ever to be found or excavated for their particular phase or tradition. Allen McCartney seems to have done much the same with XCB-003. A simple survey, a chance find, a single season of opportunity, and now in hind sight, one of the most important and yet enigmatic finds on the southern Bering Sea has been carefully documented. Not only is XCB-003 an important site region- ally and chronologically, but it is also a site that allowed McCartney to directly address the problem of ethnic boundaries. In 11 seasons of research, I have never seen another site in the region where this would have been possible to such an extent. He obviously did not know that he would find a site that was directly related to his original research design, but by chance or fate, it all came together in a short month of investigations. Acknowledgments. I would like to thank Allen McCartney for his decades of dedication to north- ern studies, his ability to inspire new and interest- ing research efforts, his generous efforts helping me build a career in northern anthropology, and being a dear friend. I would also thank John Dixon and Doug Veltre for putting together this conference and arranging for the publication of the proceed- ings and Don Dumond for his comments on some of the ideas that ended up in this paper. Two anonymous reviewers and Susan Kaplan con- tributed greatly to the final product. Allen McCartney was able to read this paper and approved of the tone, findings, and conclusions. Jim Jordan and I reworked the regional chronology together while on Sanak Island in the summer of 2004. The research described in this paper is a product of National Science Foundation grants OPP-0137756, OPP-9996415, OPP-9996372, and BE/CNH-01 19743. Much of the labor, analysis, and intellectual development for this project is partially a product of a large number of dedicated undergraduate and graduate students, especially Michael Falkner, Gena Huffman, Tara Gauthier, Amber Tews, and Andy Williamson - their work and effort is gratefully acknowledged. End Notes 1. From this point on, all dates are calibrated dates using Oxcal, unless specifically noted. 2. Another important consideration, and one that has been mentioned by a number of archaeologists who contemplated working in this region, is the density of brown bears. 3. It took the BIA crew a while to figure them out and only after seeing them in a number of locations did the pattern become clear. 4. The two earlier dates, which fall in what I term the Frosty Creek Phase, are probably spurious based on what I know of the site XCB-028, where they were collected. 5. The chronological sequence presented in the paper supersedes and replaces all previous presen- tations of this chronology. 6. I have also seen a large, private collection of fishtail points from Stepovak Bay on the Pacific side opposite Port Moller. 7. I have found ground slate that dates before 2400 B.C., contemporaneous with Ocean Bay II, but there is none known between 2400 B.C. and 200 B.C., the time periods of our most intensive research. 8. Holland makes a good case for the manufacture of slate tools on Akun since the percentage of the assemblage that is slate is considerably higher there than anywhere else in the eastern Aleut region. Unfortunately, there are not enough radio- carbon dates to place these sites in a detailed regional context. 9. While polished slate is an important part of Kachemak Tradition assemblages, and plays an important technological role in Norton tradition sites in the Yukon Delta, Norton Sound, and further north, Dumond has demonstrated that polished slate might be more rare in Norton sites on the upper Alaska Peninsula than it is in contemporane- ous sites on the western Alaska Peninsula.</page><page sequence="11">1 08 Arctic Anthropology 4 1 :2 References Cited Aigner, Jean S. and T.
