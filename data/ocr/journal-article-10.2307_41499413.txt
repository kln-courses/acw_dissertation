This is manifest in the growing of number of articles in the science education literature as well as in many national educational reforms worldwide. However, while voices for early childhood education increase, one should also bear in mind that still there are those who object to the view that science should start so early in life. I cannot forget the comments I received from one reviewer on a recent grant proposal for the Israeli Science Foundation concerning science education in kin- dergarten. It was clear that in the reviewer's eyes science in kindergarten should be limited only to causal obser- vations of nature and the cultivation of an enjoyment of it. As far as I could see, the reviewer saw no place in kindergarten for developing the kinds of thinking and skills necessary for scientific inquiry. Unfortunately, this reviewer still represents a common opinion about early childhood science education. The danger of that view is that it opens the door to science education's becoming marginalized in the schools. Indeed, there are a more than a few schools in which there is little science in the early grades and none at all in the kindergarten. Even where science is taught in kindergarten and the earliest grades of school, it is too often a caricature of science that is pre- sented to the children. H. Eshach (Œ3) The Department of Science and Technology Education, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel e-mail: heshach@bgu.ac.il I of course agree that young children should observe nature and learn to enjoy it; however, it seems to me ter- ribly wrong to think that science education in the early years should be limited to this. On the contrary, my experience in working with children in kindergarten and primary school as well as with their teachers has persuaded me that science education can go beyond observation in nature - much beyond! My own experience and research concurs with Metz' s conclusion that young children have well-enough developed cognitive machinery to benefit from activities geared towards significant scientific inquiry. Moreover, it may be that by ignoring the development of inquiry skills and reasoning at this age we are missing an important window of opportunity for expanding young children's scientific thinking. Accordingly, this special issue explores the possibilities and benefits of teaching science in a significant way to children in their early school years. I hope, in the end, it will show that starting science as early as kindergarten will be viewed not only as possible but as essential. For me, this special issue is a natural continuation of the positions described in my book, Scientific Literacy in Primary Schools and Preschools (Eshach 2006) and broadens its horizons. The papers included in the special issue not only consolidate the positions in my book but also show, much more than I could in 2006, the variety of learning environments possible for K-6 science education and explore much more expansively the actual experiences of children and teachers vis-à-vis science education. For this reason, the special issue is divided into two parts: Innovative learning environments for K-6, and Children and Teachers' Perspectives. In choosing the papers for this special issue, my hope was that taken together they would influence the science education community in the following ways: â Springer</page><page sequence="2">436 J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:435-443 • They would promote the idea that starting science education as early as kindergarten is not a luxury, but rather an important and crucial stage necessary to inculcate in children the patterns of thinking needed to cope with tomorrows' world. • They would share innovative, researched-based learn- ing environments for science shown to impact chil- dren's cognitive and affective needs. • They would generate critical reflection on early science education, and would encourage a clearer articulation and understanding of early science pedagogy. • They would paint a picture of perspectives of teaching and learning from teachers' and children's points of view across cultural and national boundaries. In one way or another, the papers that I finally received did indeed answer these hopes of mine. To see how this is so, I shall give a brief review of the various insightful papers that were finally accepted, organized into the two parts of this special issue. Part A: Innovative Learning Environments For K-6 1. Zoller, U. Science and Technology Education in the STES Context in Primary Schools: What Should It Take? Based on a longitudinal research, the author of this paper develops the view that not only science and technology are relevant topics to primary school, but moreover, that their teaching has the potential of enhancing students' high-order cognitive skills (HOCS). I thought that it would be good to start with this paper because whereas other papers in this special issue relate only to specific high order cognitive skills, this paper presents a more holistic picture of HOCS- centered capacity building. The author considers the shift from lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS) teaching, to the development and fostering of HOCS not a trivial one, perhaps one that requires a paradigmatic shift. This paper could perhaps be viewed as a first step in the road from LOCS-based teaching to the HOCS-based teaching and assessment. Accordingly, the author does not focus only on theory, but rather makes the move from theory to practice. The paper provides some leading normative guidelines for the development of such curricula, accompanied by exam- ples. One interesting idea presented in the paper is that the contemporary dominant LOCS-type assessment strategies applied in science and technology education are, in fact, restraining the development of HOCS. To achieve the desired paradigmatic shift, one should not only invest efforts in changing curricula, but also develop and imple- ment appropriate assessment methodology. Springer 2. Danish, J.A., Peppier, K., Phelps, D., &amp; Washington, D. Life in the Hive: Supporting Inquiry Into Complexity Within the Zone of Proximal Development. Teaching that takes Piaget as its inspiration - the kind of teaching adopted by most schools - typically tries to identify children's cognitive abilities and then adjust teaching practices to those abilities. An alternative approach, more consistent with a Vygotskian framework would be to create situations (necessarily via some type of social interaction) in which children's cognitive abilities can develop. These situations are, of course, what creates a "zone of proximal development" (ZPD). One can argue that followers of Piaget tend to see the students' current cognitive abilities as a constraint limiting their teaching, while the Vygotskian approach sees those cognitive states as the starting point for teaching and a springboard for higher cognitive activity. The present study follows the Vygotskian approach. It describes and evaluates the design of a new software simulation, BeeSign, aimed at enabling young children to learn about a complex system, in this case the life of bees in a hive. The authors show how the Vygotskian approach manifests in the design of the learn- ing environment, in general, and the BeeSign software in particular. Following the Vygotskian approach and care- fully considering what kind of mediator mechanisms might be effective, the designed learning environment leads stu- dents to productively understand honeybees collecting nectar as a complex system, a feat that some, holding Piagetian perspectives, might consider "developmental^ inappropriate" for first- and second- graders. This approach is quite promising in light of the shift educators are asked to make from low- to higher-order cognitive skills based teaching. The present paper, which deals with complex system thinking - clearly a higher-order cognitive skill - advances us one step further in the direction of making the paradigmatic shift towards HOCS teaching, suggested be Zoller (this issue). 3. Zhang, M., Parker, J., Eberhardt, J., Passalacqua, S. "What's so terrible about swallowing an apple seed?" Problem-Based Learning in Kindergarten. This paper examines how the problem-based learning (PBL) method can be implemented in kindergarten. According to PBL, posing an authentic problem that is interesting to a child, even though the child might not have the complete background knowledge, might be a good starting point for learning. When I first saw the title of this paper I thought that it belonged to this special issue. I strongly believe in PBL. Unfortunately, the school and kindergarten system deemphasize the use of PBL while encouraging other thinking mechanisms such as rule-based reasoning. One reason for this might be that teachers lack</page><page sequence="3">J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:435-443 437 the knowledge of how to carry out PBL activities. This study not only exposes kindergarten teachers to the idea of PBL, but also demonstrates how a veteran kindergarten teacher, adapted PBL to teach students big ideas such as what earth materials plants need to grow, a topic empha- sized in the new state curriculum standards but one with which students have difficulty. This paper can be of use to those who see the worth of PBL and would like to use it in their classrooms. 4. Hsu, C.Y., &amp; Tsai, C.C. Facilitating preschoolers' scientific knowledge construction via computer games regarding light and shadow: The effect of the prediction-observation-explanation (POE) strategy. This paper by Hsu and Tsai bring computer games to the scene of early childhood education. Learning through playing is an important aspect of the early childhood way of learning. Computer games have become today an inte- gral part of child's world. For that reason it is natural to use computer games to teach science. However, the border between just having fun and "learning with fun" is narrow. The present study helps us reduce our concern in this regard. The authors found that children who played the computer game designed according to the POE (White and Gunstone 1992) guidelines outperformed those who played the game which did not integrate the POE strategy, espe- cially for learning the concepts of shadow formation in daylight and shadow orientation. The POE can be seen as a kind of scaffolding which assists children to focus on significant characteristics of the physical phenomena. Also, predicting, observing and evaluating might require HOCS and thus one can easily agree that the use of the game in combination with the POE is a kind of HOCS-promoting teaching. 5. Feldman, A. Authentic Science Research in Elemen- tary School After-School Science Clubs. This paper describes a unique collaboration between university science researchers and elementary school sci- ence teachers. A professor of analytic chemistry whose research focused on finding inexpensive ways to measure environmental arsenic, mentored primary school science teachers, and they in turn, mentored their students. The professor and the teachers also developed together activi- ties that the elementary school students could do to mea- sure minute quantities of arsenic, and to produce results that would be useable for the chemist's research program. The students' projects were completed successfully and were presented as posters at a conference where the sci- entists went from poster to poster, speaking with the teachers and children about their research, and taking notes of findings that were of interest to them. In less than one academic year the teachers, who had very little formal background in science, were able to gain intellectual and methodological proficiency to facilitate the children's legitimate participation in authentic scientific research. It is my belief, that just like the authors of this paper found such a willing and passionate scientist collaborator, that there are others waiting to fulfill their desire to help others learn to do research. I encourage educators to locate such sci- entists and work with them. There are many other questions that might be raised regarding such a project. For instance, what help do scientist need to work with elementary teachers/students? What topics of research can succeed in such an experience? What are the help/activities that can be done with the teachers in order to inculcate in them inquiry skills? I hope that researchers will continue this direc- tion.The above five articles dealt with innovative science HOCS-promoting learning environments. The remaining three articles in Part A, in addition to referring to HOCS, also address children's affective needs. 6. Peleg, R., &amp; Baram-Tsabari, A. "Atom Surprise: Using Theatre in Primary Science Education. Peleg and Baram-Tsabari raise the curtain with "Atom Surprise", an educational science play. Their paper, "Atom Surprise: Using Theatre in Primary Science Education", shows that science theatre may present scientific content to young children well and may contribute to both conceptual understanding as well as positive attitudes towards science. However, alongside the advantages of using educational science theatre to teach science, one must consider the perils as well. For instance, one risk could be the creation of anthropomorphism and materialistic thinking. The authors showed that children could distinguish well between scientific facts and the fictive narrative. It follows that they will be able to draw the boundaries between human characteristics and behaviors and scientific expla- nations to natural phenomena. I would positively invite educators to enter the world of theatre and use it as another, positive emotions-evoking and enjoyable educational resource for escalating children's knowledge on the topic. I would also invite researchers to enrich our perspectives on this promising venue. 7. Katz, P., A Case Study of the Use of Internet Photobook Technology to Enhance Early Childhood "Scientist" Identity. Continuing in the vein of the previous article, this article as well presents a novel learning environment that addresses children's affective needs, this time by allowing him to explore his identity as being scientist. It suggests the novel idea that the use of internet photobook technology may support the child's development of an identity as "me, as scientist." The author, who was also the grandmother of the research's participant, dealt with the following Springer</page><page sequence="4">438 J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:435^143 questions: How would a child respond in a conversation about himself as a scientist while viewing a photobook with selected pictures of himself playing in familiar set- tings? What does the child think of as science? What happens between the child and adult during the viewing activity? In what ways could this tool further the child's science education? I find the idea presented in this paper fascinating. Indeed, the use of photographing as a peda- gogical tool is not new in the science education field. In Israel, for instance, digital cameras are used in many kin- dergartens. In the framework of the science and technology curriculum, the kindergarten teachers ask there students to use these cameras to collect and document data. For example, children take pictures of a plant at different times, and follow its growth. The children themselves are usually not in the picture. In an earlier paper of mine I suggested using photographs as a tool to identify students' miscon- ceptions (Eshach 2009). However, the photographs in those activities did not include the child. I believe that "insert- ing" children into the picture better exploits the use of photography and takes it beyond being just another way of documenting a physical phenomenon. 8. Akerson, V.L., Buck, G.A., Donnelly., L.A., Nargund, V., &amp; Weiland, LS. The Importance of Teaching and Learning Nature of Science in the Early Childhood Years. It is a well acknowledged in the literature that students should not only learn the sciences themselves, but also learn about the nature of science (NOS). What is so fresh and novel in this paper is that it brings NOS to the scene of early childhood education (K-3). At first glance one may think that K-3 is too early for exposing students to NOS ideas. However, this same concern can be heard regarding teaching science itself. And indeed, if science is an appropriate subject for youngsters, why not NOS? This paper wonderfully succeeds in convincing the reader that it is never "too early" to begin teaching accurate under- standings of NOS aspects. Beginning to teach NOS at the early grades, and then continuing to emphasize and teach even more NOS throughout their school career, could help students finish high school equipped with NOS conceptions recommended in today's curricula. But in addition to the cognitive reason for the importance of teaching the NOS to young children, there is an affective reason as well. Exposing children to science develops positive attitudes toward science. This is very important due to the fact that attitudes, which have a great impact on behavior, form quite early in life (Eshach 2006). One finding of the present paper was that many young children believe that science has nothing to do with creativity. Such views, in my opinion, may contribute to children's negative attitudes toward science. Teaching the NOS, as the authors of the â Springer present paper show us, might help change such views, and contribute to more positive attitudes toward science. This paper also furnishes the reader with practical tools ideas for both teaching NOS aspects to K-3, as well as for examining children's understandings of these aspects. Part B: Children's And Teacher's Perspectives Part В of this special Issue is divided into two groups: Teacher perspectives and Children perspectives. The papers in the Teacher perspectives part examine different aspects of teachers such as the scaffolding strategies they use when conducting science activities, the influence of professional development projects, and teachers' pseudo- science beliefs. In the second group of articles, I put together articles that examine different aspects of chil- dren's learning such as using young children's ideas to guide science curricula, children's observation compe- tency, and investigating children's perceptions of their experience of design &amp; technology in relation to creativity. Teacher's Perspectives 1. Eshach H, Dor-Ziderman, Y, &amp; Arbel, Y. Scaffolding the Scaffolding metaphor: From inspiration to a practical tool for kindergarten teachers. My own paper, written in collaboration with Yair Dor- Ziderman and Yael Arbel, takes a close look at three experienced kindergarten teachers acknowledged for their excellent science teaching skills, with the purpose of identifying the scaffolding strategies they use when con- ducting scientific activities. While the idea of scaffolding is not a new one and may be traced back to Vygotsky's notion of the zone of proximal development (Vygotsky 1978), when it comes to actual implementation of early childhood science teaching practices, the shift required is nearly a paradigmatic one. I think I will not be mistaken in saying that the authors of this special issue, myself included, agree that such a shift in teaching should be made. Science teaching should not be geared solely towards what children can do on their own, but also towards what they can do when provided with assistance. This acknowledged, an entirely new set of tasks arises for science education. Thus, instead of designing activities bound by the limitations of the children's present abilities, we must allow ourselves the space to consider where we are heading and to design tasks that scaffold students' progress towards these goals. This also raises new questions such as what should be consid- ered an appropriate scaffold? Beginning to provide answers to such questions is the aspiration of this paper. In pursuing this goal, it was assumed that much could be</page><page sequence="5">J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:435-443 439 learned from the practices of acclaimed professional sci- ence teachers - even if they themselves were unaware of the implicit knowledge they held. Accordingly, we identi- fied hidden scaffolding strategies these professionals used when conducting scientific activities with young chil- dren. The results yielded what we termed the scaffolding scheme. A set of practical cognitive and affective scaf- folding strategies to be used by kindergarten teachers for providing their students with more appropriate scaffolding for developing inquiry skills. 2. Roehrig, G.H., Dubosarsky, M., Mason, A., &amp; Carlson, S., &amp; Murphy, B. We Look More, Listen More, Notice More: Impact of Sustained Professional Development on Head Start Teachers' Inquiry-Based and Culturally-Relevant Science Teaching Practices. Many students view science as separate; not connected to real life. This phenomenon might be even stronger in indigenous student populations where the culture of wes- tern science is far removed from the students' culture, to the point of sometimes even contradicting it. So it seems that there might be a significant gap between the culture that the students come from and science. In recent years there has been a growing recognition that educators need to develop curricula that encourage students to develop a perceptive model that includes a connection between human activity and physical, chemical and biological processes within their local environment and culture. In this way every-day and scientific concepts are linked and concepts gain meaning as tools in relation to traditional practice. This paper describes such an effort to create a culturally-based science curriculum in American Indian early childhood classrooms. The results from the study provide strong support that culturally-based science pro- fessional development can positively change the quality of science teaching and that teachers are able to engage the children in culturally-relevant and investigative science and mathematics activities. As a result of participating in this project, teachers learned to "look more, listen more and notice more" in their environment and used what they looked at, listened to, and noticed in their environment to teach better science to their students. It always strikes me as incredulous that kindergarten teachers as well as primary school teachers need guid- ance to realize that science can be found in their students' environment, and not just in textbooks and classrooms. Teachers mainly use what they have learned in their training programs, and thus it is difficult for them to see science in their close environment. Thus, the present paper argues that systematic professional development for teachers towards this end is needed. The paper also pro- vides many examples of how cultural tools such as stories and objects can be used in science teaching, and also demonstrates what we should do in order to prepare teachers to implement cultural-based curricula. 3. Losh, S.C. &amp; Nzekwe, B. The influence of education major: How diverse preservice teachers view pseudoscience topics. There is much evidence in the literature that primary school and kindergarten teachers lack scientific knowledge. This lack of knowledge is one reason why science educa- tion at the kindergarten and primary schools is so poor. But not only what scientific knowledge teachers possesses, or lacks, matters. The present study brings to our attention that what also matters and might have a great impact on the scientific knowledge, as well as on the teaching sciences are pseudoscience beliefs (e.g., astrology, ghosts or UFOs). Surprisingly, there has been no research, as far as I know, that examined such knowledge of kindergarten and primary school teachers. I agree with the authors that examining pseudoscience beliefs, which are rife worldwide, might provide a broader view of teachers' understanding of sci- ence. Pseudo-science beliefs might influence their under- standing of scientific concepts, and even cause some of their rejection. Also, teachers' pseudoscience views might impact the students' pseudoscience views. This paper advises us that the pseudoscience beliefs phenomenon should not be taken lightly, and should be dealt with seriously within teacher training frameworks. Also, the authors recommend that we should be aware of the impact of the media, where many "scientific channels" exists. To sum, to help teachers as well as students distinguish the "real" from the "pseudo", one should get the ghost out of the bottle, so-to-say, and thoroughly discuss it with the teachers and the students. 4. Ben-Zvi Assaraf, O. Learning from failure: A case study of where an extracurricular science program went wrong. This article examines an after-school science learning environment. Teachers in such environments frequently, if not usually, have no teaching certification. In many cases the teachers are just older students. Although this is often simply a matter of poor financial resources, the practice of giving the task of teaching to older students has been jus- tified on what could be called socio-cultural grounds. First of all, since these older students come from inside the school community, they are familiar with the particular language, habits, learning styles and life experiences of the participating children. Moreover, these students are almost always exemplary science students on their own. There- fore, it is thought that by employing them as teachers they can serve as models for the children participating in the after-school science program and, thus, instill a positive image of science in the minds of the children. However, it â Springer</page><page sequence="6">440 J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:435-443 is also assumed, partly again on socio-cultural ground, that the positive contact with these older students will bring about a more fruitful learning of scientific ideas and sci- entific skills. The present study's findings are that while there was evidence that the children, indeed, developed positive ideas of science, there was no evidence that they gained greater scientific understanding. So, should these programs be considered successes or failures? The present study refuses to reject the second possibility, that is, that in after-school learning environments things can genuinely go wrong. Taking failure seriously is crucially important for science education; needless to say, studies dealing with failures of this type are not as common as one would hope. The subject is also important because such programs are proliferating quickly and becoming more and more central in children's scientific education. There may also be the- oretical implications requiring a more refined understand- ing of the relationship between the child and the more- knowledgeable elder. Children's Perspectives 5. Dori, J. &amp; Barak, M. Science education in primary schools: Is an animation worth a thousand pictures? This paper revolves around web-based animated movies for science teaching purposes. The use of web-based animated movies for educational purposes is on the rise, but as using movies might also adversely affect the attainment of the educational goals, teachers should use them carefully and as part of a larger set of learning materials. By applying the mixed methods approach, the authors examined whether web-based animated movies contributed to students' understanding of scientific concepts and to their explana- tion ability. The authors also examined how teachers integrate movies into their curriculum and how they viewed the role of animations in enhancing young students' high order thinking skills. The results of the paper might shed light on the use of animated movies in science lessons and help teachers to carefully consider not only the power but also the peril of such movies. This paper raises some other questions which the community of early science education might be interested in. For instance, considering my own study (Eshach et al., this issue), one may want to examine what kind of scaffolding, if any, should teachers provide to their students while using animated movies. One might also want to analyze students' discussions during and after the animated movies. So, while the authors do indeed provide important answers to the question in their title "Is an Animation Worth a Thousand Pictures?" further research is needed to gain deeper insight into this question. â Springer 6. Liu, C.J. The influence of different representations on solving concentration problems at elementary school. The question of proportional reasoning has been of continual interest in mathematics education since, at least, the late 1960's with the publications of Leslie Steffe, Richard Lesh, and others. Its importance for scientific reasoning was also recognized quite early, indeed, by Piaget himself in the mid- 1950 s. For Piaget, moreover, the ability to compare and coordinate two simultaneously changing quantities at the foundation of proportional rea- soning was a central matter in the general development of children's reasoning. These issues, proportional reasoning in mathematics, proportional reasoning in science such as in concentration problems, and proportional reasoning as a component in cognitive development, are all very much alive and still of great importance in the fields of mathe- matics and science education. This article explores ele- mentary school students' problem solving strategies in solving concentration problems with different representa- tion types. To this end, the author uses a very interesting methodology, an eye-tracking system, which is not an instrument typically employed in the science education research field. This paper not only enriches our perspec- tives in regards to the topic of the investigation per se, but also shows how using the eye-tracker can benefit early science education research. I believe that being aware of such techniques might open the doors to other ques- tions which the early science education community might be interested in, but has lacked the research tools to explore. One interesting finding yielded from analyzing the eye- tracking data was that the type of representation used in the problem influences students' solutions. For instance, the fifth graders tended to use numerical computation when the problems were displayed in symbolic representations. In other words, one can say that the representations used in the problem space impacted children's solution space. Based on these finding, the author concludes that repre- sentational types in textbooks may be a key factor in the learning of science concepts and suggests that textbook writers be aware of the visual representations they use. This conclusion should not be taken slightly. We live in an age in which, thanks to computers, creating representations of all sorts is easy. This has great advantages but also have some perils as well, as one may focus on such represen- tations that are bombastic indeed, having the power of emotional impact, but lack efficiency in terms of concep- tual development. 7. Patrick, P. &amp; Tunnicliffe, S.D. What plants and animals do early childhood and primary students' name? Where do they see them?</page><page sequence="7">J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:435-443 441 Animals and plants are central topics in early childhood science education. This, of course, is not surprising at all, as animals and plants are naturally a part of the child's world. The present research aims at enriching our under- standing of the plants and animals children name and where they see them. Understanding children's knowledge of the characteristics, habitats, and locations of everyday plants and animals is the beginning of understanding children's zoological, ecological, and environmental knowledge. This knowledge might provide us with important information that can be used by teachers who wish to design more efficient learning activities suitable for children. The findings suggest that children have a wide understanding of the animals they encounter in their everyday lives and that they remember plants and animals that have been introduced to them outside of school. However, it was also found that schools do not have a considerable influence on how children understand objects in their natural environment, especially at younger ages. Furthermore, it was found that the knowledge that children acquired out-of-school remained out-of school. The paper also gives due attention to cultural/national differences by looking at how children's understandings regarding ani- mals and plants are manifest in the UK and the USA. The findings of this research show that even though the USA and the UK are similarly developed countries, using the same language and having very close cultures, some dif- ferences exist. 8. Siry, С. &amp; Kremer, I. Children explain the rainbow: Using young children's ideas to guide science curricula. In kindergarten, as opposed to what typically happens in school settings, science activities are not always planned in advance, but rather may be the result of a spontaneous curiosity regarding a phenomenon observed by the chil- dren. This raises important questions such as, how to use children's interests emerging from observing a natural phenomenon for developing science activities? and how to build on the theories they have already generated about the science phenomena? This paper aims at providing answers to the above questions. In particular, it highlights the complexities of young children's emergent ideas regarding rainbows, a topic that children repeatedly drew and talked about during free-drawing time in the classroom in which the research was conducted. By doing so, the authors demonstrate how the children's own interest could be used as a starting point to further scientific activities. Like some other papers in this special issue, the present one as well is rooted in sociocultural theoretical perspectives, and the authors view knowledge as primarily a cultural product, characteristic not only of the child but of the child-in- social-activities (Vygotsky 1978). As such, this paper examines children's ideas on science phenomena as being expressed and developed through conversations and in interactions. Their paper shows that children often hold creative as well as sophisticated ideas of phenomena, and that these can be used and built upon in developing science activities. The authors also argue that rather than framing these ideas as naïve, the possibility exists for teachers and students to try together to learn more about the phenomena in question. 9. Ching-Ting &amp; Wu, S.K. Using scaffolding strategies to promote young children's scientific understandings of floating and sinking. This paper joins the strand running as a common thread throughout the papers in this special issue, that what should be explored is not only the knowledge students arrive at as a result of a specific intervention regarding a specific top- ics, but more importantly, to examine also what kind of support should be given to the children while they learn. The authors test three kinds of supports: a) scaffolding material - providing scaffolding and allowing children to see the materials of the objects and manipulate them; b) scaffolding only - providing scaffolding and allowing children to manipulate the objects, but the children did not know what the objects were made of because the objects were covered by colored tapes. Objects made of the same material were covered by the same colored tape. Therefore, by seeing the tape colors, children could identify the objects that were made of the same material even though they did not know what the material really was. C) Material group - the tutor did not provide any scaffolding but chil- dren could see the materials of the objects and manipulate them. The authors found that the combination of material scaffolding with verbal guidance and support is the most effective help. Furthermore, for the material scaffolding to be effective it should be as rich as possible enabling the children to perceiving the materials of objects as well as manipulating them. 10. Kohlhauf, L. Rutke' U., &amp; Neuhaus, B. Influence of Previous Knowledge, Language Skills and Domain- specific Interest on Observation Competency. The term 'observation' comes from Latin. It is a com- pound of ob- and servare. Observare means to watch, watch over, observe, keep an eye on (something). The word servare (pronounced serware) means to protect or guard or watch over, among other things. The prefix ob- has the sense of being in front of. So ob-servare has the sense of watching something by staring right at it. The term observation today is associated with more than seeing and includes also all the information we perceive by our senses. Observation is an important skill in science. However, and, far from what Popper liked to call the 'Baconian myth' Springer</page><page sequence="8">442 J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:435-443 (Popper 1963), abstracting facts into concepts or theories does not follow from simple observation and experiences in the world. In other words, observing at a natural phe- nomenon by "staring" right at it with our senses vis- à-vis would not enable one to build a theory. This may be well demonstrated in the following quotation relating Darwin's (1859/1985) theory of natural selection: When Darwin first discovered the now famous vari- ety of finches in Galapagos island, he did not rec- ognize them as varieties of the same species or even related (Quammen 1996). Darwin did not observe nature selection in the Galapagos. It was only after he returned to England that he began to work out his theory of natural selection, cautiously and painstak- ingly ... (Sandoval and Millwood 2005, p. 25). The authors of this paper make the argument, evident also in the above quotation, that observation itself is worthless if it is not combined with interpretations. Inci- dental or unsystematic observations would not have led Darwin to his evolutionary theory, but rather his questions, his hypotheses and his interpretations had made his observations scientific systematic observations. Based on the literature from biology, psychology and biology edu- cation, the authors propose, following Darwin, that scien- tific observation can be divided into five different dimensions: describing, asking, assuming, testing and interpreting. The present research examines whether the following factors have an impact on observation skills and if so, to what extent: language skills, previous knowledge, and domain-specific interest. The study showed as expected that previous knowledge had a high impact on observation competency, whereas the influence of domain-specific interest was nonexistent. Language skills were shown to have a weak influence. I believe that being aware of this study on observation competency may assist teachers in not only assessing the actual observation competency of children in kindergartens and preschools, but also enrich teachers' perspectives on the observation phenomenon itself. 11. Benson C. &amp; Lunt, J. "We're creative on a Friday afternoon": Investigating children's perceptions of their experience of design &amp; technology in relation to creativity. The design &amp; technology (D&amp;T) approach to technol- ogy education was developed in a national movement in England and Wales during the 1980 s, and in 1990 England and Wales (DESQWO) added D&amp;T as a required subject for all students into the new National Curriculum. The approach aims to make students responsible for major decisions about what kind of artifact or system is needed, what the product will look like, who will be using it, how it â Springer will work, and how it should be produced. D&amp;T offers the potential for children to construct, apply, debate about, and evaluate their designed and made products, rather than simply absorb transmitted information about them. Cris- mond (2001), based on the literature, argues that design, like scientific inquiry, engages the core strategies of anal- ysis, synthesis, and evaluation, which appear as the three highest-order educational objectives in Bloom's taxonomy (1956). The present research brings into play the voice of the children. I agree with the authors that children naturally have very particular and important insights to offer in helping us to develop our understanding of teaching and learning and that the voice of the children has yet to been heard. Their research teaches us that many of the children involved agree that in D&amp;T they learn to be creative, experiencing making their own decisions and having ownership and control over their work. They feel motivated and free in terms of time and space, and have rich oppor- tunities to work with others. The authors also argue that these features of the D&amp;T learning environment are asso- ciated in the literature with creativity, and therefore con- clude that the majority of the children involved perceived that D&amp;T as related to creativity. It is my hope that the voices of children will be also be heard in other domains, and as in this case, these will further strengthen theoretical ideas and thus increase teachers' motivation and knowl- edge in pursuing and implementing D&amp;T in their classes. To conclude, despite the great number of papers in this special issue, looking at the many matters connected with early childhood science education, and that, from many different perspectives, we can identify some common strands linking them together. In particular, I think it is fair to say that collectively the papers all confirm the following statements: 1) Science and technology should start as early as kindergarten and elementary schools. 2) Children have sufficient cognitive capabilities to engage in scientific inquiry. But one might go further and say that not only should early science education take these capabilities into account, but it should look forward towards other capabilities for which these form a foundation. Perhaps, even more than in middle and high school (where it becomes much more important to develop scientific concepts and concep- tualizations), developing these capabilities and expanding children's cognitive machinery should be the central focus for early science education. 3) Children are not expected at early ages to conduct scientific inquiries individually. Rather they should be provided with a variety of opportunities to participate in inquiry activities. In other words, when thinking of</page><page sequence="9">J Sci Educ Technol (201 1) 20:435^43 443 science education and the design of scientific activities for children at an early age one should not think of what children can do on their own, but rather what scaffolding should be provided so that children enter their zones of proximal development, to use Vygots- kian language. 4) Kindergarten and primary school science teachers will be capable of teaching science if they are properly prepared and taught how to design appropriate inquiry- based learning environments and how to provide children with efficient scaffoldings. In the end I would like to express profound thanks to the author teams for their important and original contributions to this special issue. I am sure that the marvelous collection of papers presented in this special issue will indeed, as the title of this introductory piece suggests, create new fron- tiers for science and technology education in kindergarten and primary schools, a field of endeavor that I feel is only at the beginning of its way. Acknowledgments First I want to thank Dr. Karen C. Cohen, the Editor in Chief of the Journal of Science Education and Technology for her support. This special issue would never have come to be were it not for Karen Cohen's vision that children everywhere should become motivated curious citizens, eager to learn and inquire, and able, ultimately, to make a genuine contribution to humanity. I also want to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and thorough suggestions to the authors. I also want to express my gratitude to Michael N. Fried for helping me in writing the introductory piece and to Yair Dor-Ziderman for not only editing the introduction but also for his always insightful ideas.
