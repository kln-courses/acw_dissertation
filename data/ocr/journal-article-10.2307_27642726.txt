Springer 2006 Analogues of Ourselves: Who Counts as an Other?* FRANCES CHAPUT WAKSLER Wheelock College, 200 The Riverway, Boston, MA 02215, USA, E-mail: fwaksler@comcast. net Abstract. What attributions must any actor make to an other in order to engage in face-to face interaction with that other? Edmund Husserl's use of "analogues" suggests that actors use their own experiences of themselves as a starting point in making such attributions. Alfred Schutz and Erving Goffman claim that for face-to-face interaction to occur, an other must be recognized as copresent and reciprocity must be established. I assert here that the means for determining that these conditions have been met will vary. I explore a variety of actors and in particular their differing identifications of interactionally available others and I take as problematic the establishment of co-presence and reciprocity. Taking others to be "analogues of ourselves" serves as a useful starting point, but worthy of detailed analysis is how and with whom an actor draws the analogy, under what circumstances it comes in for revision, and the interactional consequences of the decisions made. Key words: analogues, animals, children, divine others, Erving Goffman, Edmund Husserl, phenomenology, retarded, Alfred Schutz 1. Introduction Of what Edmund Husserl terms "the insane," "children, even those who al ready have a certain amount of world-consciousness," and "animals" he writes, There arise problems of intentional modifications through which we can and must attribute to all these conscious subjects - those that do not cofunction in respect to the world understood in the hitherto accepted (and always fundamental) sense, that is, the world which has truth through "reason" - their manner of transcendentality, precisely as "analogues" of ourselves. (1970,187) A fundamental question that continues to intrigue me is: What attributions must any actor make to an other (what I term an "interactionally available other") in order to engage in face-to-face interaction with that other? Husserl's * Versions of this paper were presented at the Boston University Sociology Department Graduate Colloquium (1999) and the meetings of the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences (2001). I am indebted to George Psathas, Hisashi Nasu, Jeff Coulter, and Norman Waksler for their comments on these various versions.</page><page sequence="2">418 F.C. WAKSLER use of "analogues" suggests that actors use their own experiences of them selves as a starting point in making such attributions. Based on their experi ences, actors may immediately accept or reject others as interactional others - but only, in Alfred Schutz' and, later, Harold Garfinkel's words, "until fur ther notice." "Further notice," however, may come and the "other" status of the other come in for reassessment. Thus the prior understanding of a start ing point may be rendered ambiguous and either reformulated or rejected altogether. My specific concern in this paper is with just such instances of "further notice," i.e., of actors' experiences of face-to-face interaction when what counts as an other is questioned or even denied by one of the partici pants, by observers, by "common knowledge," by theoretical constructions - or indeed by readers of this paper. 2. The Other as Participant in Face-to-Face Interaction By the term face-to-face interaction I mean the everyday experience of being "with" someone, of being "together." Time and space are shared, "the other's subjectivity is available to me through a maximum of symptoms" (Berger and Luckmann, 1967: 29), and participants influence one another. Schutz de scribes the face-to-face situation as characterized by "spatial and temporal immediacy," features that he takes to be "essential to the face-to-face situa tion" (1967a: 163). Goffman offers what he calls a "rough" definition of face to-face interaction as "the reciprocal influence of individuals upon one an other's actions when in one another's immediate physical presence" (Goffman, 1959: 15). Thus co-presence and reciprocity are presented as defining attributes of face-to-face interaction. If so, how are these attributes assigned? Who can judge that an interactionally available other is co-present; that participants stand in a reciprocal relation; that these conditions of face-to-face interac tion are being met? Clearly, anyone who is involved in making a determi nation that face-to-face interaction is occurring, has occurred, or will occur makes just such judgments. But while the necessary conditions must obtain for face-to-face interaction to be occurring, the means for determining that these conditions have been met will vary. My analysis here focuses on face-to-face interaction as the actor experi ences it - however that might be - and in particular on how the actor identifies an other as available for, indeed capable of, interaction. In my explorations I follow Schutz and Goffman in taking as fundamental to face-to-face in teraction (1) co-presence and (2) reciprocity. I do, however, part company with them in two ways: (1) by exploring a variety of actors, their experiences and perspectives, and in particular their differing identifications of interac tionally available others and (2) by taking as problematic the establishment</page><page sequence="3">ANALOGUES OF OURSELVES: WHO COUNTS AS AN OTHER? 419 of co-presence and reciprocity, a problem that requires for its resolution the successful identification of an other as other. Criticism 1. Although Schutz speaks of taking the perspective of a par ticipant ("Let us first look at the way in which the face-to-face situation is constituted from the point of view of a participant in that situation," 1967a: 163), his analysis suggests that participants are generic, interchangeable, nec essarily in agreement. Goffman recognizes this problem in Schutz, writing To speak here of "everyday life" or, as Schutz does, of the "world of wide awake practical realities" is merely to take a shot in the dark ... [A] mul titude of frameworks may be involved or none at all. (Goffman, 1974: 26) Rather than overcoming this problem, however, Goffman merely substitutes himself as generic observer. Goffman has contributed greatly to an under standing of face-to- face interaction from the perspective of an observing so cial member. Because of the perspective he chose, however, he did not explore (and in all likelihood was not interested in exploring) the participant's per spective, except as it can be gleaned by a generic observer, i.e., what it "looks like" from the outside. Apropos of both Schutz and Goffman, Erazim Koh?k, in his commentary on Husserl's Ideas, writes that "there are and can be no 'subjects as such,' having 'experiences in principle.' Subjects are always particular subjects; their experiences are particular, 'subjective' experiences" (1978: 99). I see both Schutz and Goffman as ignoring actors' different ways of being in the world, indeed assuming away such differences, silencing the problematic aspects of face-to-face interaction for the specific actors involved in producing it. Criticism 2. Both Schutz and Goffman introduce generic actors who are in face-to-face interaction, for whom taking part in face-to-face interaction is not problematic. My formulations are designed not to supercede those of Schutz and Goffman - indeed I have made extensive use of their ideas. Rather I seek to explore what goes before what they investigate. I simply - although not so simply - want to start at an earlier point in analysis than that from which they proceed. Specifically, I want to know whom actors must identify as others if what Schutz and Goffman describe is to take place. My long-range project, of which this paper is a part, is to provide a Husserlian prolegomenon to Schutz and Goffman. 3. Problematic Others How are such problematic instances as I will offer here relevant for displaying the taken-for-granted structure of face-to-face interaction and, in particular, the identification of interactionally available others? That face-to-face inter action is constructed is demonstrated by its dependence on the attributions</page><page sequence="4">420 F.C. WAKSLER that participants make to one another - attributions that they may fail to make, with the consequence that face-to-face interaction does not, indeed cannot, take place. The value of unusual examples is their disclosure of what is hid den if analysis is restricted to those occasions when face-to-face interaction is simply grasped as a whole and unproblematically engaged in. Husserl speaks of the importance of such unusual examples. Over against the continuous synthesis of agreement, the syntheses of con flict, of misinterpretation and differing definition, and whatever they may else be called, must come into their rights, for a phenomenology of "true reality" the phenomenology of "vain illusion " is wholly indispensable. (Husserl, 1962: 388, ?151, emphasis in original) Koh?k in his commentary on Ideas writes, Intersubjective understanding is an experiential given before it becomes a philosophical problem. The startling reality is not that misunderstandings and breakdowns of communication occur but that they are breakdowns within a basically common comprehension of our humanity. (1978: 5) I am interested in ambiguous instances and failures of face-to-face interac tion as ways of gaining insight into what is ambiguous and what has failed. Exploration of these "misunderstandings and breakdowns" holds the promise of providing detailed insight into that "common comprehension of our hu manity." Of particular relevance here is the recognition that different people recognize different "others" as interactionally available. Given that observers (scientific or lay) or even potential participants them selves may not share assessments of the reality of a situation or of its con stituent parts, I see as especially important that I as sociological analyst neither take sides nor make independent assessments of the reality or legitimacy of participants' perspectives. The descriptions that follow are taken from the perspective of those claiming facticity for those they count as others. To their descriptions the following questions can be addressed: Who counts as an other? How is that other constituted?1 Is there agreement among participants and onlookers or might the latter offer alternative, and contradictory, explana tions? How are co-presence and reciprocity established or denied? With what consequences? 3.1. Divine Others:2 Talking with Jesus Consider the following apparently ordinary (if perhaps somewhat soap opera ish) instance of face-to-face interaction: Jim was there with me. I said to him, 'You're the only person I can communicate with totally'</page><page sequence="5">ANALOGUES OF OURSELVES: WHO COUNTS AS AN OTHER? 421 'Yes.' I looked at him and he laughed. 'Talk out your feelings to me. You think that's not fair, not being able to talk perfectly to others. But you don't want to mention it to me!' I felt ashamed. 'April, you said you gave yourself to me. And now you still aren't ready to say your feeling out loud to me. You're angry at me. Then, say it. If you are a friend, you must tell the truth.' 'Why did you do this to me? I'm terrified.' He hugged me. I have, however, in the foregoing made what might appear a consequential substitution. The excerpt is from April Oursler Armstrong's Cry Babel ( 1979), an account of the author's life with aphasia. In the passage she describes one of a number of her face-to-face interactions not with "Jim" but with a "divine other," Jesus. She writes, Jesus was there with me. I said to Him, 'You're the only person I can communicate with totally' 'Yes.' I looked at Him and He laughed. 'Talk out your feelings to Me. You think that's not fair, not being able to talk perfectly to others. But you don't want to mention it to Me! ' I felt ashamed. 'April, you said you gave yourself to Me. And now you still aren't ready to say your feeling out loud to Me. You're angry at Me. Then, say it. If you are a friend, you must tell the truth.' 'Why did You do this to me? I'm terrified.' He hugged me. 'No barriers. No pretending. God is not polite. God is not a thing, or a time. God is. So many people won't talk to God if they are going to the bathroom, or feeling angry, or shaking with frustration. God is in each person, but most people don't believe it. We exist everywhere.' 'Believe in You. And so, O.K., I believe You picked the worst cross for me. No words, no books, no nothing.' The moment I said it, I giggled and felt better. But He shook His head. 'You can't pretend to smile and laugh when you feel that way. That is unreal. In a way, you will find the paradox of your life now. But, for the moment, say the truth: you don't know how to say the mystery, but you're angry at Me. Don't be scared ofthat.' I had stopped smiling. (Armstrong, 1979: 33-34) Armstrong presents the foregoing as an actual conversation with Jesus, one of a number that she describes using as a basis for formulating her plans and actions.3 Despite the fact that others might deny Jesus' physical pres ence, Armstrong does not. Not only does she explicitly state that "Jesus was there with me" but she describes his bodily availability for reading ("He laughed," "He hugged me," "He shook his head"). He influences her but she too influences him, for he laughs at what she says, accepts some of her claims,</page><page sequence="6">422 F.C. WAKSLER rejects others, to all appearances fulfilling the requirements of an interactional other. 3.2. The Retarded As David A. Goode in A World Without Words (1994) makes clear, the pro foundly retarded may be viewed as minimally capable or altogether incapable of interaction, at least in part because they are viewed as unable to take the per spective of the other (see Mead, 1964). Their mode of face-to-face interaction may, however, simply differ from that of "normals," thereby going unnoticed by those "normals." Breta's mother states of her blind, deaf, alingual, pro foundly retarded child, "Breta tells me everything" while professionals who "assess" Breta deny that such is possible. Are Breta and her mother engaging in face-to-face interaction? Is Breta an interactionally available other? Who decides? (It is noteworthy that Goode, initially doubtful of the mother's claim, in time came to accept it.) In an earlier article entitled "Who Is Bobby?" (1983) Goode analyzes a videotaped conversation among an occupational therapist, a research assistant, another client, and Bobby (a fifty-year-old man with Down's Syndrome living in a residential care facility). Goode writes, As I [and the staff] watched the video tape repeatedly, an even more radical appreciation of Bobby's abilities to understand and communicate emerged. During the incident and during initial viewings of the tape, it had appeared that many of Bobby's utterances were unintelligible (if not unintelligent). But by the time we watched the tape ten or fifteen times, many of those 'unintelligible ' utterances began to sound quite clear. While it was true that persons on the tape did not appear to understand Bobby, those same persons watching the tape repeatedly could hear words where formerly they heard mumblings We began to appreciate the degree to which Bobby's not making sense to us was a much our 'fault' as his. (13, emphasis in original) It thus appears that those viewing the tape may have come to a retrospective determination that face-to-face interaction had indeed been taking place, that Bobby was an interactionally available other. Other than his difficulties in getting himself understood, the transcript of that tape revealed that Bobby had followed the theme of the conversation all along, and had produced semantically meaningful (if ill formed) utterances. We began to appreciate that cognitively, Bobby was far more complex than we had comprehended. He was not by any means a genius, but he was clearly above the 2.8 year old mentality which he was assigned in his clinical record. . .(14, emphasis in original)</page><page sequence="7">ANALOGUES OF OURSELVES: WHO COUNTS AS AN OTHER? 423 In the original interview, from Bobby's perspective face-to-face interaction appears to have been taking place, a determination available to Bobby at the time but only retrospectively available to the staff, for initially they appear to have granted co-presence but denied reciprocity. Far less time and effort may be required for Bobby to identify interactionally available others than for others to so identify him. Clearly there is a significant difference between Bobby's others and Bobby as other. 3.3. Interacting with the Animals Husserl writes, [T]he attitude which is oriented toward men and animals is a new one - toward men and animals not as bodies to be investigated consistently and descriptively in the attitude oriented toward nature but as men (or animals) who have their bodies as living bodies, who have their personal surrounding world, oriented around their living bodies as the near-far world and, at the same time, in the manners of appearing of right-left, up-down - all these manners of appearing standing in a successive relation of dependence to subjective manners of T move my living body' in a system of kinestheses which can be realized even voluntarily. (1970, Appendix III: 331-2) Is animal-human face-to-face interaction possible? Can an animal count as an other for a human? (A sampling of perspectives on this matter are provided, for example, by Herne, 1987; Crist, 1999; and Lynch, 1988.) The answer seems to depend on one's model of animals. Coulter, for example, writes, Whatever it is that the dog feels (fear? affection?), the ascription of cate gories such as guilt, shame, or remorse, apply only by analogical extension; warranted ascriptions of such categories properly depend upon the recogni tion by the offender of some standards of conduct, some rules applicable in the situation, and the understanding that violations are not merely unpleas ant if uncovered but wrong. It becomes clear that the capacity to experience genuinely either shame, or guilt, or remorse, hinges upon a mastery of a natural language involving cultural knowledge and reasoning conventions. (1979: 132-133, emphasis added) Must the dog be able to master a natural language to experience these feel ings? Or is it sufficient for granting otherness to a dog that a (human) natural language user be able to make such attributions? Although I agree with Coulter that attributions to dogs may require ana logical extension, so are they required, as Husserl asserts, for human-human interaction. Those who argue that interaction with animals rests on anthropo morphism fail to recognize that interaction with other humans also requires anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics and possibilities to other humans. Some humans are not granted such characteristics by some</page><page sequence="8">424 F.C. WAKSLER others (Goode, above) - and some animals are. Thus Harriet George in How to Talk to Your Dog makes just such attributions, writing, "Dogs are clever at detecting insincerity, and if you are caught in duplicity, you [a person] are likely to endanger your status as an alpha" (1985: 43). She describes ways of reading dogs' bodies for what they intend: The dog's emotional expressions of anxiety, happiness, peace of mind, anger, affection, jealousy, embarrassment, and hostility are not too different from our own ways of communicating our feelings by face and body. The ability of the dog to read our feelings seems like mental telepathy until we observe what we are saying with body and face. (1985: 69) To some extent, you can mimic dog body language to say some things to your pet if you loosen up enough and do not mind looking ridiculous. (1985: 83) (For further discussion of reading dogs' bodies, see, for example, Rugaas, 1997 and Cs?nyi, 2005, the former a dog trainer, the latter an ethologist.) Emily Hahn writes of Madam Abreu and Chimpita, a chimpanzee with whom she lived, that Madam Abreu was convinced he [Chimpita] understood everything said to him. One day she was feeding him, grape by grape. She never let her pets swallow grape seeds for fear they would get appendicitis, and as Chimpita ate, she held out her hand for the seeds. With his fingers and, sometimes, his lips, he picked them up and gave them to her, all except two, which had fallen into a little trench between the cage wire and the cement and which he couldn't reach. 'Chimpita,' said Madam, 'you know perfectly well that when I am gone, you will eat those seeds.' He gave a long-suffering look and went off to find a small twig. He brought it back and prodded the seeds out with it and duly handed them to her. (Hahn, 1988: 35) What counts as evidence for attributing to Chimpita the status of interactional other? His giving her the seeds, his "long-suffering look" (appropriate to the circumstances), obtaining a "tool," recovering the seeds, and handing them over. Further, the statement attributed to Madam Abreu ("you know perfectly well...") is not a command but a comment whose meaning and consequences require Chimpita's deciphering. One can, if one so desires, question the accu racy of the description, but for my purposes here it is important to note that from Madam Abreu's perspective as described, Chimpita is an interactionally available other - as indeed Madam Abreu is for Chimpita. 3.4. Children Children's experiences provide two quite different instances of problematic others: (1) Children's others may be unacknowledged or contested by adults</page><page sequence="9">ANALOGUES OF OURSELVES: WHO COUNTS AS AN OTHER? 425 and (2) Children themselves may be denied the status of interactionally avail able others. Consider, for example, the following two descriptions in which a child's determination of who counts as an other may differ from what adults would recognize but is nonetheless a crucial piece of information in making sense of the child's concerns. It would embarrass me so much when my parents would argue in front of the television. They would never scream or swear, they would just be extremely sarcastic to each other. I didn't find my parents to be very funny, and I thought the people on TV could hear them. I remember one time when they got in a huge fight while Donny and Marie Osmond were on, I got so upset I started crying and turned the television off and ran straight to my room. That was a very traumatic day for me. (Rita, emphasis added)4 Of her childhood, Rose wrote: Monsters never existed during the day when anyone else could see them but every night when Mom tucked me in, shut the light off, and went downstairs I could feel the presence of the monsters. I could feel them, hear them, and sometimes even see them. What did Mom say when, after what seemed like hours went by, I finally started frantically screaming? She said, 'Rose, don't worry. There is no such thing as a monster.' I would wonder to myself about how she could be so stupid. I knew they were there and she didn't care. I cried myself to sleep for years. This was partly because I was so terrified and partly because Mommy didn't care. (Rose, quoted in Waksler, 1996: 91, emphasis added) Rita's and Rose's experiences can be fully understood only if one recognizes who counts as full-fledged others for them. Adults' denial of children's others may have little effect on children's acceptance of those others but may have consequences for children's assessment of adults' competence. Equally frustrating for children may be adults' denial of children as interactionally available others to them (the adults). Whether or not adults acknowledge children as such depends upon the attributions that adults make to those children.5 Elsewhere I have described two general biases that charac terize adults' attributions to children, that "Children are unfinished, in process, not anywhere yet" (Waksler, 1986: 73ff) and that "Children are routinely wrong, in error, and don't understand" (Waksler, 1986: 76ff). Given such biases, children of a rather wide range of ages may be viewed as "too young," "too immature," or otherwise ineligible as interactional partners for adults (see Waksler, 1999). They may be viewed as undeserving of the interactional rights granted to adults, their efforts to initiate interaction ignored or redefined as misbehavior.6</page><page sequence="10">426 F.C. WAKSLER Goffman writes that the child "is subjected to various forms of nonperson treatment. He is talked past and talked about as though absent" ( 1976/1979:5). When children are treated as nonpersons, their very co-presence may be de nied, their subjectivity unacknowledged, their influence prevented, ignored, even punished. And children may both notice and be critical of such exclu sion from face-to-face interaction and critical of adults' methods for accom plishing it. My informants7 identify just such nonperson treatment. Helen speaks of "the tendency for adults to gather in groups purposely excluding children." She continues, speaking of interviews she conducted, "[One of my informants] claimed she was bothered by the exclusivity of adults, their air of smugness, and their exclusion of children from the conversation" (Helen). Another informant offers a similar complaint. Adults bothered me when they would talk about their children as if they were not there, for example, two mothers in a store, while their children are with them, talking about their kids to each other. (Esther) Providing further evidence of children's nonperson status, for children can be talked about in the way one talks about those who are absent, Esther continues, They would sit there and gab about what the kids have done with their kids standing next to them. My mother used to do that to me all the time. / used to butt into the conversation and she used to get angry with me. (Esther, emphasis added) Children's attempts to assert their status as other may be not only unsuccessful but also punishable. Children may conceal their contested others (TV characters, monsters, dolls, imaginary friends) from adults but nonetheless maintain their relation to those others and fault adults for obtuseness and thoughtless actions. Children may also, when with 2i?u\ts,faute de mieux comport themselves as non-present nonpersons but may also recognize that they are being asked or required to do so and resent it. Adults may be unaware of children's resentment, for adults' denial of otherness prevents reciprocity, rendering unavailable to them children's subjectivity. Adults may deny children's others or children as others, but children's experiences, despite their concealment from adults, may retain their validity for those children. 4. Conclusion To speak of "analogues of ourselves" is not to restrict otherness to those who are "just like us" but rather to those who are enough like us in relevant respects to make interaction possible - and "enoughness" is sufficiently ambiguous</page><page sequence="11">ANALOGUES OF OURSELVES: WHO COUNTS AS AN OTHER? 427 both to allow for a range of determinations and to provide fruitful sources of detailed study. By exploring varied kinds of others, I am seeking the underlying processes whereby others are constituted, i.e., taken to be interactionally avail able to actors. Further exploration can be directed, for example, to children's imaginary friends, children said to be feral, the deaf, schizophrenics, guardian angels, demons, and those who have "passed on." In this process, taking others to be "analogues of ourselves" serves as a useful starting point, but worthy of detailed analysis is how and with whom the analogy is drawn, under what cir cumstances it comes in for revision, and the interactional consequences of the decisions made. The determination that an other is interactionally available may start with preconceived general notions of what is possible but may also respond to new information and the requirements of an immediate situation, and thus may be subject to revision. Phenomenology's focus on lived experience allows the examination of indi vidual instances for what they display Ultimately the interactional availability of any other may be arguable; the central issue for me, however, is not what anyone might decide but what the actor decides - and what I as analyst may come to understand on the basis of the data made available by that actor. That onlookers may disagree need not be relevant, though it may be consequential for participants. Actors' others may be discounted by observers or other par ticipants - "Jesus wasn't really there," "the child is just pretending," "the dog doesn't know what you're saying - you're anthropomorphizing," "ghosts do not exist," "you're crazy." Actors, however, can maintain their commitment to their others, even in the face of such discounting. Not just any person can interact with a gorilla; doing so requires at a minimum that one see it as a possibility (see, e.g., Gorilla: Journal of the Gorilla Foundation). Notes 1. For a detailed case study that explores this question, see Waksler (2004). 2. I have appropriated the term "divine others" from Edward Berryman 's paper in this volume. 3. Simple instances of prayer do not routinely count as face-to-face interaction but are similar to such forms of interaction as telephone calls or letters. Armstrong, however, is not praying; she is, from her perspective, apparently engaging in face-to-face interaction. 4. Taken from my unpublished data, young adults' written descriptions of the difficulties of being a child - both their own and those of people they interviewed (see Waksler, 1996). 5. Adults may differ from one another in the attributions they make to children and the same adult may make different attributions depending upon specific circumstances. For a discussion of infants' possession of a self and an argument for their availability as interactional partners as well as criticisms of theoretical approaches that reject such an argument, see Sheets-Johnstone (1996). 6. Sacks recognizes that children may both recognize their limited rights to initiate interaction with adults and develop strategies to initiate that interaction nonetheless. One right children are granted is to ask adults questions; children (according from Sacks, from the age of</page><page sequence="12">428 F.C. WAKSLER three) may divert this right to their own ends, asking adults "You know what?" In so doing children obtain the right to talk by responding to the adult's "What?" (Sacks, in Waksler, 1991:211-212). 7. See footnote 5. References Armstrong, A.O. (1979). Cry Babel: The Nightmare of Aphasia and a Courageous Woman's Struggle to Rebuild Her Life.
