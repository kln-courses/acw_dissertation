<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XII NUMBER 3 JUNE, 1951 THE CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFECTS OF PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY* BY HAROLD CHERNISS It is only fair for you to be forewarned that I do not intend to present you with an exhaustive doxography, a list of the opinions and systems of all the important philosophers before Socrates, or to offer you a formula to which the meaning of all Presocratic philosophy can be reduced. My purpose is merely to suggest certain salient charac- teristics which, I believe, can help one to find one's way through the extant remains of Presocratic philosophy and to appraise at something like their real value the many formulae which have been offered, each as the only effective key to the understanding of those remains, and then to indicate how the Presocratic thinkers affected the character of subsequent philosophy. This subsequent philosophy has unfortunately limited seriously and to some degree effectively prevented our direct approach to the Presocratics. We possess no single complete work of any of the Pre- socratic philosophers, and most of the scanty and disconnected frag- ments that we have are preserved only because they were quoted by post-Socratic philosophers for their own dialectical purposes or quoted by later commentators of those philosophers in illustration of the statements which they had made about the Presocratics. The result is that such direct quotations of the Presocratics as we do possess are almost entirely a selection determined by the interpretations and for- mulations of Presocratic philosophy by the post-Socratic philosophers for their own philosophical purposes, chiefly by Aristotle and to a lesser extent by Plato, by the Stoics, and by the Sceptics. The ancient accounts of Presocratic philosophy are prejudiced in the same fashion, since most of them depend ultimately upon Theophrastus' History of Philosophy and in that work Theophrastus interpreted the Pre- socratics not merely according to general Peripatetic formulae as might have been expected but usually in close dependence upon the particular formulations of Aristotle. In considering any so-called * A lecture originally delivered at St. John's College, Annapolis, Md., on Decem- ber 10, 1948. 319</page><page sequence="2">320 HAROLD CHERNISS fragment, therefore, it is necessary not to be content to read it in iso- lation. One must take into consideration the whole context in which it has been preserved (a context which sometimes is as extensive as a whole book of Aristotle's Metaphysics), the ultimate source of that context if it can be discovered, and the possible reasons why this par- ticular fragment was quoted or this particular interpretation adopted in this particular place. Such careful investigation, comparison, and reflection are necessary before one can feel even reasonably sure that one is ascribing to a Presocratic philosopher a conception or an atti- tude that was his own and not some later interpretation or deforma- tion of it. There is no more significant characteristic of a philosopher's thought than the kind of questions that he asks, the problems which he feels called upon to solve as contrasted with the assumptions that he makes; and it is just in this respect that the character of Pre- socratic thought is most thoroughly concealed and misrepresented as a result of the channels through which it has been transmitted. The doxographers listed the opinions of all philosophers as if they were all answers to the same questions asked in the same way; and each phi- losopher interpreted his predecessors, if he considered them at all, as if they had been trying to answer the same questions which he had posed for himself. Book A of Aristotle's Metaphysics, for example, which both directly and through Theophrastus had greater influence upon the subsequent ancient histories of philosophy than any other single work, interprets all previous philosophy as a groping for his own doctrine of four-fold causality and is in fact intended to be a dia- lectical argument in support of that doctrine,1 which itself implies a question that could not have been formulated before Plato. Aristotle as a philosopher is, of course, entirely justified in inquiring what answer any of the Presocratic systems could give to the problem of causality as he had formulated it; but to suppose that such an inquiry is historical, that is, to suppose that any of these systems was elabo- rated with a view to that problem as formulated by Aristotle, is likely to lead to misinterpretation of those systems themselves and certainly involves the misrepresentation of the motives and intentions of their authors. It is in this same book of Aristotle's that Thales appears as the first of the " material monists," 2 and this is the ultimate source of the 1 Cf.

How, when, and from what origins Greek philosophy arose are questions which have excited interest, speculation, and contro- versy from the time of Aristotle to the present. Greek mythography, the Greek rationalistic spirit, the influence of Babylon or Egypt, the practical interests of the sea-faring and colonizing Milesians, mysti- cism, and interest in the form of divinity, each of these has been held responsible for the appearance in Ionia in the early sixth century B.C. of that systematic concern with the constitution and meaning of exist- ence which is the essence of Greek philosophy. All of these various explanations, however, are based chiefly upon analogical arguments, the validity of which is highly dubious, and upon late Greek state- ments, which are themselves rather hypotheses and speculations than historical evidence. The lack of any real evidence for the resolution of this problem is emphasized by the paucity of genuine evidence con- cerning Thales himself. What Aristotle himself knew about Thales' opinions he says that he knew only by tradition; and this was very little and in its significance not at all clear. Thales declared, they say, that the earth rests upon water. So Aristotle in the De Caelo,3 where he discusses the position and stability of the earth; in the pas- sage of the Metaphysics to which I have already referred he states that this notion of Thales' followed from his doctrine that all things come to be from water. This, at any rate, is a doctrine which Thales " is said " to have held,5 and on the basis of this Aristotle makes him a " material monist "; but he does not tell us who said so. It might possibly have been Hippo, who held the doctrine himself and who may have sought in this way to lend it authority after the fashion of antiquity. Hippo is mentioned in this same passage,6 and Aristotle here suggests as a reason why Thales decided that all things come to be from water an argument which elsewhere he ascribes to Hippo.7 What we know of Aristotle's general method of interpreting his prede- cessors, however, and the specific purpose of his dialectical history in this book arouse the suspicion that Thales was not led from the general doctrine that all things come to be from water to draw the conclusion that the earth rests upon water, but conversely from the tradition which ascribed to Thales the notion that the earth rests upon water Aristotle inferred that he had made water the origin of everything. This suspicion is heightened by the fact that Plato does 8 De Caelo 294 A 28-30. 4 Metaphysics 983 B 21. 5 Metaphysics 894 A 2-3. 6 Metaphysics 984 A 3-5. 7 De Anima 405 B 2-3.</page><page sequence="4">322 HAROLD CHERNISS not mention Thales in connection with this doctrine in the passages where, attempting to establish the antiquity of the doctrine of flux, he facetiously ascribes it to Homer, Hesiod, and Orpheus on the strength of lines that make Ocean the origin of the gods.8 To Plato Thales was one of the Seven Sages,9 a man to whom tradition ascribed in- genious contrivances for the practical arts.10 To Herodotus he was known for having advised the Ionians to form a confederation, for having foretold a solar eclipse, and (a tradition which Herodotus dis- believed) for having diverted the course of the Halys river which blocked the way of the army of Croesus.1l Several passages of Aris- tophanes 12 show that the name " Thales" had in the fifth century B.C. come to be used proverbially to indicate skill in such activities as surveying and engineering, a usage which reflects the same tradi- tion as the later ascription to Thales of the introduction of geometry from Egypt 3 and of a work on navigation.14 Such traditions, if taken seriously, can be used to support the thesis that Ionian philosophy grew out of an interest in practical techniques; but, on the other hand, those who insist upon finding the origin of that philosophy in mysti- cal or theological motivations can appeal to the traditions according to which Thales first declared souls to be immortal,15 asserted that all things are full of gods,'6 and ascribed a soul to the magnet because it moves iron.17 The trouble is that tradition assigned these or similar statements to other philosophers or sages also,18 that, strictly consid- ered, the last two are not consistent with each other,19 and that quite contrary interpretations of these statements can be defended with equal force. To say that all things are full of gods, for example, may be to mean that all things are divine in a mystical or religious sense or equally to mean that nothing is, in the way that the author of the Hippocratic essay, "On the Sacred Disease," asserts that all diseases are divine and all human, meaning that no disease is sacred in the religious sense at all.20 8 Cratylus 402 B-C, Theaetetus 152 E and 160 D. 9 Protagoras 343 A. 10 Republic 600 A. 11 Herodotus, I, 74, 75, 170. 12 Clouds 180; Birds 1009. 13 Frag. der Vorsok.5, I, 76, 10ff. 14 Ib., I, 80, 3ff. 15 Choirilus apud D.

He had become a kind of "culture-hero" of philosophy; to his name were attached apo- phthegms and edifying anecdotes to illustrate, sometimes in contradic- tory fashion, the characteristics of the philosopher; and attempts were made to derive Greek philosophy through him now from foreign and again from indigenous sources by making him a pupil either of the Egyptian priests and the Chaldeans 21 or of Homer and Hesiod.22 For all purposes of practical consideration Greek philosophy begins with Anaximander, and so it did in ancient times too. That is the kernel of truth in the artificial scheme of successions preserved in the first book of Diogenes Laertius,23 according to which Ionian philosophy began with Anaximander, and Thales, though he is presumed to have been Anaximander's teacher, is listed not among the philosophers but among the sages. Anaximander did write a book which was known to Apollodorus of Athens in the second century B.C.; and because of this, although only a few words of that book have been preserved for us, and because Anaximander had made a map which engaged the attention of Era- tosthenes, so that his place in the geographical tradition is still dis- cernible, we are not restricted for our knowledge of his work to the doxographical tradition alone. To Aristotle and to Theophrastus, and hence to the doxographies derived from Theophrastus, only those of Anaximander's statements were of interest which dealt with cosmol- ogy or natural science and appeared to have ontological or metaphysi- cal implications; but study of the material that does not derive from this tradition has shown that Anaximander was not merely a physi- ologer in the Aristotelian sense and suggests that the orientation and the interests of the Ionian philosophy of Anaximander's time were far different from what Aristotle would lead one to believe. Anaximander's purpose 24 was to give a description of the inhabited earth, geographical, ethnological, and cultural, and the way in which it had come to be what it was. His book began with a cosmogony and ended with a description of the contemporary world which was in a sense a commentary on the map of the inhabited world that he had 21 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 11 A 11. 22 Probus ad Vergil., p. 21, 14 K (Dox.

The details of his theories aside, the startling and important features of his thought are its universality of scope, its freedom from anthropocentric orientation, and the strictly impersonal causal nexus which is assumed to hold together all objects and events. This is Ionian " historia " in its full sense, the investiga- tion of all existence without specialization or compartmentalization. Anaximander is at once astronomer and geographer, cosmogonist and genealogist, meteorologist, biologist, anthropologist, and historian- not any of them as profoundly as were the specialists to follow him but all of them equally in the service of the complete object of "his- toria," knowledge of all the world as it is. Moreover, in this world, which is the object of his investigation, man has come to be under the same conditions and limitations as other objects; he is not something apart from the world but is of it and determined by it, not having been always such as he is now but having developed from animals of another kind,25 animate beings themselves having developed from in- animate matter.26 Nor is this world, or cosmos of earth, sun, moon, and stars unique; there is at any moment an unlimited number of such worlds, all of which arise from " the unlimited," which encom- passes them all, and into which all of them ultimately pass away to be replaced by others which arise in the same fashion.27 This " un- limited," TO APEIRON, that from which all the worlds and all that is in them are separated out and into which they are again absorbed, is not a single unqualified substance from which entities are developed by qualitative change. The distinction of quality and substrate, the notion of alteration, and the logical conception of identity which makes a paradox of change had not even occurred to Anaximander; they are conceptions which were to come later and gradually, and they have to do with Anaximander's ARCHE or "reservoir " only in the sense that it involves them as problems which are as yet unrecognized. For Anaximander the APEIRON was simply a boundless expanse of infi- nitely different ingredients so thoroughly mixed together as to be 25 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 12 A 10 and 30.

Frag. der Vorsok.5, 12 A 9, 10, 11, 14, 17.</page><page sequence="7">PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY 325 severally indiscernible in the mixture but which when segregated from the mixture are recognizable as all the differences of an articulated world; 28 it is like nothing so much as that " limitless sea of dissimili- tude " into which, in the myth of Plato's Politicus,29 the cosmos is periodically in danger of sinking. A passage derived from Theo- phrastus 30 proves that Anaximander refrained from specifying further the nature of this reservoir of all existing things; but the designation that he chose for it, the adjective APEIRON substantivized by the defi- nite article, since it has the appearance of an abstraction, made it easy for Theophrastus to follow Aristotle 31 and, despite his better knowl- edge, taking TO APEIRON in Aristotle's sense of ARCHE as a " principle " or " element " rather than in Anaximander's of " source " or "reser- voir," 32 to interpret it in terms of Aristotelian prime matter as the substrate which is the indeterminate potentiality of all the properties, none of which it has actually.33 Before Plato, however, both the name and the notion of abstract quality were unknown, and for all Pre- socratics what we call a quality was a characteristic which could not be considered separately from that of which it was characteristic.34 TO APEIRON is in this respect no different from such a designation as TO THERMON. As the latter does not mean "heat" in Aristotle's sense or ours, an abstract quality which cannot be anything other than itself, but that which is hot or all hot things, which being hot may yet at the same time have many other characteristics, so the former means that which is " unlimited," though besides this signifi- cant characteristic it may have other characteristics too. The sig- nificance of the fact that Anaximander called his ARCHE simply TO APEIRON without further specification or restriction is not that limit- lessness or infinity exhausts its nature but that it is unlimited without restriction, unlimited in every sense of the Greek word, in extent, in multitude, and in kind, in short not that it is potentially everything being actually nothing but infinity, as the Peripatetic interpretation would have it, but that it is everything in actuality. Once this is recognized one finds no trouble but only consistency in the fact that the one Greek sentence of Anaximander's which has been preserved, 28 Crit. Pres.

This may be what he meant by the statement, if it is really his, that the APEI- RON, which he called ageless, deathless, and indestructible, encom- passes and guides all things.41 Ageless, deathless, and indestructible are traditional Greek epithets of the gods. Because Anaximander applied them to his APEIRON, which guides all things, and Aristotle concluded that this is what is considered to be divine,42 it has recently been contended 43 that there is a deep religious significance in Anaxi- 35 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 12 B 1 in its context, 12 A 9. 36 Cf., e.g., Gigon, Der Ursprung der Griechischen Philosophie, pp. 30 and 61. 37 Cf.

This is a conclusion which is at the very least unwarranted, even if Anaximander did say that what is divine is his APEIRON, which is far from assured by the evidence, and call the articulated worlds " gods," as the doxography reports.44 The latter source in the same context ascribes to Thales the statement that god is the mind which fashioned all things from water,45 a manifest fiction which casts suspicion upon the report concerning Anaximander's worlds. Among the sayings ascribed to Thales 46 is one that defines the divine as that which has neither beginning nor end. Such sayings are "floating maxims" ascribed now to one sage and now to another; but they are undoubt- edly old, and Aristotle probably had in mind nothing more than this traditional saying when he remarked that the unlimited is what is considered divine. In any case, Anaximander's APEIRON is in no way conscious or personal and, if it guides all things, it does so in no volun- tary sense. The worlds which are segregated from it are reabsorbed by it " as needs must be," and Anaximander envisaged this repeated process as a settling and resettling of accounts among the ingredients of the APEIRON which by being reabsorbed into the common mixture make amends and requital to one another for injustice done " in the fixed order of time." 47 This is according to him the law of all nature, "law " literally in the sense of a dicastic process which continually redresses the balance among the constituents of existence, the APEIRON being the common fund in which all accounts are equalized. If this is to be considered in relation to theology, it must be admitted to be a complete rejection of all that was traditional in Greek religion. It is the denial that natural order can be suspended by any super- natural being or force, the denial in fact that any supernatural being can exist, and the assertion that, if the divine means anything at all, it can mean only the system of nature ordered according to infrangi- ble law. This conception of nature as an all-inclusive system ordered by immanent law was Anaximander's most important legacy to subse- quent thought. The universal sweep of Anaximander's genius had drawn a cosmological picture, the general outlines and major motifs 44 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 12 A 17 (Aetius, I, 7, 12; Cicero, De Natura Deorum I, 10, 25). 45 Cicero, loc. cit.; Aetius, I, 7, 11. 46 Frag. der Vorsok.5, I, p. 71, 20. 47 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 12 B 1.</page><page sequence="10">328 HAROLD CHERNISS of which determined the limits and the direction of all subsequent Presocratic speculation in this field; but the picture that he had drawn, if judged seriously by his own guiding principle, would obvi- ously require greater elaboration and precision and rectification in detail and was most influential and most fruitful through the implicit problems to which it unwittingly called the attention of all who looked upon it with understanding. It is in this light that the achievement of Anaximander's younger townsman, Anaximenes, must be appreci- ated. Anaximenes apparently lacked the encyclopaedic interest which characterized Anaximander. At any rate, so far as is known, he con- fined his attention to cosmology and natural science-or better, natu- ral history-; but within this special field, applying with extreme rigor and consistency Anaximander's conception of nature, he devised a simple, elegant, and universal theory to account for those very aspects of the physical processes concerning which Anaximander's account was vague and unsatisfactory. The numberless differences in the articulate world had not really been explained by Anaximander at all; he had simply supposed that they are all present in the reservoir of the APEIRON from which they are separated out and into which they are again absorbed. He had not even considered what this process logically involves: the question of the existence of minute homogeneous particles, the determination of the specific character and form of such particles, the relation of the processes of segregation, aggregation, and dispersion; or the sufficient reason why any one of these processes should occur when and where it does " in the fixed order of time." To this last question Anaxime- nes offered no answer either; but he did attempt really to explain the existence of differences and to derive them from a single source by a single natural mechanism, for the operation of which he found evidence in the physical world about him. This was the mechanism of condensation-rarefaction. All change of every kind he regarded as the result of this one mechanism, in modern terms as a function of the variation of density. The air we exhale is a cold thing, if we com- press it with our lips; if we relax our lips in exhalation, it is rarefied and becomes something hot.48 If then it is compressed further, it should become water and finally earth and stones; but, if further rare- fied, it should become fire.49 These are definitely changes of one thing into another, not alterations of quality in a single substrate which 48 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 13 B 2. 49 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 13 A 7.</page><page sequence="11">PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY 329 remains identical; 50 but, since the most evenly distributed body and the most extensive is air and also because air as " breath " is identified with the soul that " holds living bodies together," Anaximenes made air, as it were, the manifestation of normal density and substituted it for the APEIRON of Anaximander. That the theory was evolved within the frame of Anaximander's cosmology is clear from the fact that Anaximenes made this extra-cosmic air unlimited in extent, that the world is produced from it and reabsorbed into it, though by the new process of condensation and rarefaction, and that within the bound- less air innumerable worlds are supposed to exist simultaneously and to pass away to be replaced by others.51 The correction of Anaxi- mander's system was far from being a mere detail, however; Anax- imenes was obviously aware of its importance, for he applied his general theory of rarefaction and condensation with impressive con- sistency to all the details of his cosmogony, astronomy, geology, and meteorology. His analysis of all objects and events in the physical world as aspects and functions of a single quantitative process is the ultimate achievement that characterizes the orientation of Milesian philosophy. It emphasizes at the same time the limitations of that philosophy, limitations which were to become important and stimulating prob- lems for subsequent thinkers. Not even Anaximenes thought to give any sufficient reason for the universal process which he had derived, either in general or in its particular manifestations. The bodies which change into one another, including the boundless air, were assumed to be in constant motion. The doxographical report that he sup- ported this with the reasoning that they would not change if they were not in motion 52 is probably a Peripatetic reconstruction; that motion is the natural state of all body seems to have been an un- conscious assumption of his as well as of Anaximander's. At any rate, he did not bother to establish any reason for motion or any causal relation of motion to the stages of the natural processes which he elaborated. Moreover, the logical difficulties involved in Anaximan- der's ingredients of the APEIRON are present in another form in the theory of Anaximenes, for the designation "air " did not imply for him an identity which includes homogeneity, since the other charac- teristics of air, as of all bodies, depend upon the mechanical distribu- 50 Cf.

What was more obvious if not more important, the Milesians had succeeded in naturalizing man in the cosmos but had done it so thoroughly as to reduce him to a physical object on the same level as all other physical objects; and these physical objects Anaximenes had in fact, though unwittingly, dissolved. His notion that all things change according to a quantita- tive mechanism leads directly to the conclusion of physical relativism, for, if water is air that has been " rearranged " by compression, air is also water that has been " rearranged " by rarefaction, nothing is any- thing but a different degree of everything else, and only the process itself remains fixed. This conclusion was drawn with radical thoroughness by Hera- clitus. In the case of Heraclitus all the difficulties involved in the interpretation of the Presocratics are magnified and are moreover further complicated by special factors. Whereas the Milesians had written in sober prose continuous treatises in which they attempted to give a systematic account of their subject, the book of Heraclitus, though written in prose, consisted of a series of apophthegms uncon- nected by any obviously logical transitions and expressed in an elabo- rate oracular style. Heraclitus apparently intended thereby to follow the example of the god whose oracle in Delphi, he said,54 neither states anything nor conceals it but gives a sign. Such writing is diffi- cult to interpret objectively but easy to quote for one's own purpose, particularly if one selects phrases that sound significant and quotes them without their context. Heraclitus was widely quoted in this fashion in antiquity; and a substantial number of these quotations is extant, in many cases different pieces-of a single apophthegm quoted by different authors for different purposes and with different interpre- tations. Aristotle, fitting Heraclitus into his general scheme of Ionian philosophy, made of him a material monist who derived all the world from a single element but for this element chose fire instead of Thales' water, Anaximander's infinity, and Anaximenes' air. Nothing of this could have been guessed from the remarks of Plato to whom Hera- clitus stood for the constant flux of all things and the everlasting accord of the discordant. The Stoics read into his book all their own 53 Cf. Crit. Pres. Phil., p. 380. 54 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 22 B 93.</page><page sequence="13">PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY 331 doctrine including the endlessly recurring cycle of the articulation of the world from seminal fire and its destruction in conflagration; and the Christian writers turned him into a phophet of their own Last Judgment and the punishment by Hell-Fire. Still by weighing all these conflicting interpretations against one another and carefully comparing the many fragments of the apophthegms that are pre- served it is possible to discern the intention and the main character- istics of Heraclitus' thought. He believed 55 that he had discovered a truth which none of the teachers of men nor any of the mass of men had yet recognized although it manifests itself to everyone at every turn. Over and over again the extant fragments state the thesis that everything is itself and its opposite, all things are both one and many, because all things are in constant flux, a flux, however, that is not disorder but a har- mony which, though hidden, far surpasses any sensible harmony. It is to signify this that he calls the world an everlasting fire " kindling according to measure and according to measure being extinguished." Fire for him was neither a mere symbol of the universal process nor a substrate persisting as identical throughout its qualitative altera- tions. He speaks of it both as a token for exchange like gold in trade and as involved in change itself; and it was the easier for him in this case to identify the sign and the thing signified, since fire does appear to be the one existing phenomenon that is nothing but change. Even so the Buddhists used it, for whom there is no Being but only con- stantly shifting events in Becoming which is itself merely flux, flux of nothing. Anaximenes had discovered that all the diverse entities in the world could be reduced to varying degrees of a single process, but he still retained the matter which changes and even clung to one phase of it as normal and so somehow more "natural" than the others. Heraclitus simply followed his discovery to its logical conclusion, for it too implied that everything was one and many, one thing now and many things before or hereafter. It is then the process alone which really exists, and all the distinctions made by men are but fleeting phases of the process. If everything were smoke and all the other senses declared the single identity of all, the nose would still deny it and smell out differences; as it is, the senses assert that the world is a multitude of differences, whereas it is really one, the process that is fire. 55 Cf.

Even in developing the logical implications of Anaximenes' theory he radically altered its orienta- tion; and despite any Milesian influence that can be discerned in the details of his pronouncements, the characteristics of his thought were entirely different from those of the Milesians and something entirely new. The difficulties that the doxographers found in extracting from his book a systematic natural history like that of the Milesians and the inconsistency of the accounts that they did produce are evidence that he had not intended to give what they insisted upon finding in his writings. We can still judge for ourselves the fashion in which his sporadic references to natural phenomena were used to construct for him a scientific doctrine. The doxographers state that he believed the apparent size of the sun to be its real size; 56 but fortunately the statement from which they elicited this notion of a reactionary astron- omy is still preserved. Heraclitus had said: the sun you can cover with one human foot; but the boundaries of the soul you could not discover, though you trod every path, so profound is its measure.67 This obviously was not meant to be astronomy at all; it has to do with the soul, not the sun, and goes to support the view of the ancient commentator Diodotus that the subject of Heraclitus' book was not natural science and that the references to natural phenomena in it had been introduced only by way of illustration.58 Heraclitus was, in fact, not interested in " historia " as such. He was willing to concede that one should investigate many things; 59 but he was scornful of erudition on the ground that it does not teach intelligence,60 and with his usual picturesqueness of expression he first stated the limitations of the instruments of "historia": the senses are bad witnesses to them whose souls cannot understand their reports.6l It is not natural phenomena but the meaning of them that one must comprehend if one is to achieve wisdom; wisdom not information or learning is the goal of man, and Heraclitus condemned all those whose accounts he had ever heard because none of them had understood that wisdom is apart from everything else.62 Yet the way of this comprehension is open to all men; he had achieved it by examining himself,63 and it 56 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 22 A 1, ? 7. 57 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 22 B 3 and 45 and Frankel, A.

This is the "hidden harmony" that determines the phenomenal world which manifests and signifies it; 67 it is that which, being " common," binds all the phases of the process together and renders the world intelligible to men if they will only open their eyes to it; 68 it is the divine law on which all human laws are nourished.69 Heraclitus had, of course, no notion of positing a conceptual pattern apart from the world of phenomena; the latter for him was the pattern, and the very possibility of distinguishing them was not to be envisaged in the time of the Presocratics; but he for the first time in Western thought declared that reality is not the world that we perceive nor any part of it but a formula that is at once hidden and manifested by this perceptible process. At least as significant for this first inclination of Greek thought in the direction of idealism is the revolutionary notion that the meaning of the world is to be discovered not by looking outward to phenomena but by probing one's own soul. In this case too Heraclitus did not distinguish two kinds of being. He did not separate the soul from the phenomenal world but thought of it as just another phase of the world process like the phases that are water and earth, in fact as fiery vapor which is a change from moisture and which changes into mois- ture again.70 As fire, then, it is the purest or highest phase of the world-process, though even in this phase distinctions can be made and the soul that is dry is wisest and best.71 The soul thus being part of the cosmic process and the best or clearest phase of it, it was no more than consistency for Heraclitus to call it also a profound formula or proportion that augments itself; 72 and one can understand how he may then have arrived at the notion that it should be possible to dis- cover the meaning of the world by examining one's own soul, since it is the clearest phase of the ordered cosmic process.

What is important and new is, first, his assertion that introspection is a way of gaining knowledge about reality and, second, the ethical imperative that rings in all his words. Philosophy is no longer a matter of intellectual curi- osity; it is a moral duty. It might seem that man, who is only a fleet- ing phase in the endless process of the world, need and can do nothing but resign himself to his lot; but Heraclitus insists, however inconse- quently, that he can and should maintain his soul in a state of intelli- gence, understand the true nature of the world, and act in accordance with his knowledge.74 It has been suggested that the conception of geometrical propor- tion, which was so important to Heraclitus and the function of which in the cosmos he tried to indicate by expressing many of his apo- phthegms in that form, was in origin Pythagorean and was known to Heraclitus from that source.75 Pythagoras is one of the persons at- tacked by name in the extant fragments of Heraclitus,76 so that the latter knew or thought that he knew something about him and may very well, despite his antagonism, have adopted some notion of his or of his followers. Pythagoras himself wrote nothing; Plato knew him only as the institutor of a way of life; 77 and in the works of Aristotle he is scarcely mentioned and his name is never associated with any of the doctrines ascribed to his school.78 A passage of Xenophanes79 in which the doctrine of metempsychosis is ridiculed was supposed to refer to him, though his name is not mentioned there; and a fragment of Empedocles' 80 celebrating an unnamed man who remembered ten or twenty of his incarnations was also taken in late antiquity to be a reference to Pythagoras. This theory of metempsychosis, which was to be adopted by Empedocles and later to be given a major role in European philosophy and poetry by Plato's integration of it into his philosophy, had been introduced into Greek thought before the time of Heraclitus, as the fragment of Xenophanes shows. If Heraclitus knew it as Pythagorean, it might well have been the source of his 73 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 22 B 118, cf. 41. 74 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 22 B 2, 43, 44 (cf. 114), 73, 74, 112. 75 Cf.

In one fragment Heraclitus calls Pythagoras "the ancestor of swindlers"; 81 in another 82 he brackets him with Hesiod and with Xenophanes and Hecataeus, condemning them all for lack of intelli- gence despite their erudition. Hesiod's theogony, his differentiation of all the gods and cosmic powers and his failure to understand that all these are only different phases and aspects of one ordered process without beginning or end, was certainly what aroused the wrath of Heraclitus,83 who was probably incensed against Hecataeus too more by his genealogies and their connections with gods and heroes than by the geographical and historical parts of his work. Xenophanes, a poet and rhapsode, who has become a figure in the history of Greek philosophy by mistake, could have been singled out for censure from among all other poets of his kind for only one reason. His historical poems could not have been unique, his references to natural phe- nomena were sporadic and made only for the sake of denying both the mythological and the subtly scientific explanations of them, he ridi- culed metempsychosis and abominated the mythology of Homer and Hesiod as heartily as Heraclitus did, and like Heraclitus he waged incessant war upon the traditional theology and ritual of Greek poly- theism. He maintained that God is one and not anthropomorphic in any sense,84 a belief that so far might have made him not uncongenial to Heraclitus; but he also insisted that God never moves or changes,85 and such a notion Heraclitus was bound to denounce with the utmost vehemence. The theology of Xenophanes and the doctrine of metempsychosis arose outside of the main current of Greek philosophy. Both, greeted with scorn at first, were soon to exercise upon it intense though spo- radic and tangential influence until finally they merged in the phi- losophy of Plato. The relations of early Pythagoreanism are even more nebulous, for there were no Pythagorean writings earlier than the time of Socrates and the later ascriptions of theories to the early school and to Pythagoras himself are quite untrustworthy. Unlike all other Presocratic thinkers the Pythagoreans formed communities whose ultimate purpose was moral self-improvement, and so a good deal of their concern was with the practice of a sort of mental and physical hygiene in which the discipline of silence and self-examina- 81 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 22 B 81. 82 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 22 B 40. 83 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 22 B 57. 84 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 21 B 23. 85 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 21 B 26.</page><page sequence="18">336 HAROLD CHERNISS tion, taboos of various kinds, music, and mathematical studies were all ingredients. In their cosmological physics they seem to have adopted and accommodated to their own use the theories of the Milesians; 86 but the distinctive characteristic of their whole doctrine was the tenet that all things are numbers. Numbers they held to be groups of units, the units being material points between which there is " breath " or a material " void "; and they quite literally identified all phenomenal objects with such aggregations of points, without, of course, considering whether these material points were themselves divisible or not.87 This was rather a materialization of number than a mathematization of nature, but it undoubtedly seemed to the Pytha- goreans to be the only way of explaining the physical world in terms of those genuinely mathematical propositions which they had proved to be independently valid and which they therefore took to be the nature of the only reality that they could imagine, the reality of the physical world. The influence in many directions of this first crude step of mathematical physics was later to be enormous, as was the Pythagorean application of mathematical conceptions to astronomy. In a sense it was the first attempt to apply the results of purely deductive reason to natural philosophy, but it was too crude and too unconscious of itself to be fruitful at once; and so it was not from Pythagoreanism directly that the impetus which this method gave to Greek thought came. According to one ancient tradition 88 Parmenides had been strongly influenced by a member of the Pythagorean sect. As his home was Elea in Magna Graecia, it is not unlikely that he was acquainted with the Pythagoreans; and the example of mathematical proof learned from them may have determined the rigorously deductive form of his argument and may have been the origin of his confidence in this method. Beyond any reasonable doubt, however, despite the recent fashion to deny it,89 it was the book of Heraclitus that aroused Par- menides to protest and to formulate the argument which at first must have seemed to be a final check to all natural philosophy. It is clear 86 Cf. Crit. Pres. Phil., p. 398. 87 Cf. Crit. Pres. Phil., pp. 386-92. 88 D. L., IX, 21; cf. Burnet, E. G.

They do not follow Reinhardt and Abel Rey in placing Parmenides before Heraclitus but treat them as if they were entirely ignorant of each other. It is certain that Heraclitus, who attacked so many people by name, did not know Parmenides, for, if he had, he would certainly have attacked him first of all.</page><page sequence="19">PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY 337 enough that he intended his criticism to apply not to Heraclitus alone but to all accounts of the world of change, those formulated by natu- ral philosophers and those implicitly adopted by laymen alike. He says as much,90 but his most virulently scornful description of the error that pervades all such accounts reproduces the peculiar and characteristic expressions of Heraclitus.91 This is reasonable, for Heraclitus had made explicit what was implicit in all the theories of a changing world and had developed to the extreme of their logical consequences and as a positive doctrine the unformulated assump- tions of naive common sense upon which all the natural philosophers had hitherto unconsciously built. Parmenides saw this, that the opinions of all men were unconscious and unsystematic Heraclitean- ism and that in refuting Heraclitus he was refuting them all; that is why he employed the significant phrases of Heraclitus to characterize the opinions of men in general. Even the form into which Par- menides put his book bespeaks its origin as a protest inspired by the haughty words of Heraclitus. Parmenides was the first Greek phi- losopher, and apart from Empedocles who imitated him in this the only one, to express himself in poetry, poetry far different in tone from the SILLOI of Xenophanes, the epics of Homer, and the didactic poems of Hesiod and not to be understood as mere imitation of any of them. It is at least possible that he intended his hexameters them- selves to be a reply and a reproach to Heraclitus' oracular and apo- phthegmatic style and that by using the most solemn and noble form of expression in the Greek tradition he meant to emphasize the seri- ousness and supreme objectivity of his own argument in contrast to the cryptic symbolism and sibylline tempestuousness of Heraclitus.92 However it may be with the poetical expression, the proem of Par- menides' book was certainly meant to contrast to the intuitional sub- jectivism of Heraclitus the universal objectivity that he claims for his own argument. This whole argument is the speech of an unnamed goddess whom he reaches by traveling on a road apart from the path of men 93 through the gates of day and night,94 which Justice, the ineluctable Law of Being,95 opens for him; and this goddess warns him to beware of the senses and to judge by LOGOS alone.96 Heraclitus 90 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 28 B 1, 30; 28 B 8, 51-52, 55, and 61; 28 B 19, 3. 91 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 28 B 6 with Kranz's notes; cf. references in Crit.

The LOGOS that Heraclitus bade men heed declared all things to be one 99 because it was the formula of the incessant change of which they are part and which they would therefore discover within themselves; but the LOGOS by which Parmenides is bidden to judge is independent of men and of the world-it is pure reason which is the sovereign canon of Being itself. Everyone had assumed that something exists. The whole argu- ment of Parmenides proceeds by applying the law of the excluded middle to prove that the identity of what is precludes the possibility of any characteristic except just being. This, he maintained, invali- dates all the theories which, disregarding the fact that a thing is what it is, proceeded to talk about change as if not every object of thought and so every existing thing had either to be or not to be; here lies the decision, but to put the case is to answer it, for to think of anything is to think of it as being. The essential nature of Being, the inner necessity that a thing is identical with itself, holds it fast in bondage and allows it neither to come to be nor to pass away. The impossi- bility of any and all process is established by the logical consequences of identity.100 As for all false notions of a world of difference and of change, the goddess lays bare the fundamental error that underlies them by showing that a whole plausible cosmology is derivable from the minimal error of positing two things that need not be identified.10l This men do, in Heraclitean fashion believing that to be and not to be are the same thing and not the same; 102 and so the articulate world is simply the consequence of an erroneous human convention.

The possibility of motion and multiplicity, the very possibility of the physical world had been impugned; and natural philosophy was forced to face the logical, epistemological, and metaphysical prob- lems of identity and difference, of appearance and reality, of truth and error. The Parmenidean logic had rudely checked the course of Greek thought, but the check was also a mighty stimulus; and, working alternately as stimulus and corrective check, it determined the subse- quent course of Presocratic philosophy which was in the main a series of attempts to save the world of nature without transgressing the rules of the new logic. The most significant and fruitful of these attempts were the sys- tems of Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the Atomists. Empedocles 104 posited the existence of four physical bodies: earth, water, and fire (the three phases of Heraclitus' process) and air (for he had discov- ered that atmospheric air is a material body); and these four bodies, each with its own characteristics, were stated to be each identical with itself throughout, homogeneous, forever unchanged, each equal to each, four physical copies, in fact, of Parmenidean Being. The mingling and rearranging of these bodies was to account for all the varied complexes of the articulate world without impairment of the identity of any real entity or infection of it with change; but, the bodies themselves being immobile in accordance with Parmenidean law, Empedocles raised to cosmic significance as two other entities the forces of Love and Strife, evidence for which he saw throughout the living world, and supposed that their pervasion of the four bodies mingles them together and dissolves the mixture. Two forces were posited and not one because the Parmenidean law of identity seemed to require that the cause of mingling or of dissolution should not in either case have the contrary character as well. According to this scheme all that really exists is six entities, each conforming explicitly to the requirements of Parmenides' logic, and all together constituting 103 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 28 B 8, 3-49. 104 Cf.

Generation and destruc- tion are expressly declared to be impossible, merely conventions of human language; 106 and all the multitudinous differences in the world are simply the external appearances of the various combinations of the identical roots.l07 The gaping lacuna in Empedocles' construction was its neglect of the problem of the part and the whole; this is most obvious and pain- ful in the " thorough mixture " of the four bodies, for in this state it is apparent that these bodies must have minimal parts, but it also viti- ates the construction at every step. Zeno, the follower of Parmenides, attacked Empedocles; and there are indications that in his attack he put his finger upon this sore point.'08 He had already counter- attacked the Pythagoreans who had sought to show that Parmenides' thesis in leading to a denial of multiplicity is self-contradictory; using against them their own dialectical method and proceeding from their own hypothesis of material points, Zeno had proved that the assump- tion of multiplicity entails contradictions more absurd than does the Parmenidean thesis, for one had either to make his multiple parts atomic or to assert the infinite divisibility of matter and the results of either choice are insoluble paradoxes,'09 the ghosts of which still arise periodically to haunt the conception of continuity in all its aspects. It was objection to Empedocles' explicit assumption that the Par- menidean law of identity need be asserted of only a limited number of bodies that produced the next important attempt, however, to reconcile natural philosophy with Eleatic logic.

Eleatic logic requires, he argued, that no new characteristic whatever be derived from any other; and therefore apparent change implies that everything be a mixture of everything else just as everything existed in the precosmical mixture of Anaxi- mander. It was, in fact, this APEIRON of Anaximander's that Anaxago- ras adopted and sought to " modernize " in accordance with the new logic. He consciously chose one horn of Zeno's dilemma and declared that matter is infinitely divisible, that there is no least part of any- thing, and that therefore everything must contain some of everything else. The motion of the APEIRON could no longer simply be assumed as it had been tacitly assumed by Anaximander, although the com- plete mixture had to be set in motion if it was to be articulated. It had, however, to be moved by something other than itself and some- thing which itself obeys the law of identity. On the other hand, since the process of separation on this theory need not be reversible, Anax- agoras felt it necessary to posit only one kind of motive entity instead of Empedocles' two; and the name that he gave to this entity was the source of his greatest influence upon later philosophy. Empedocles had derived his Love and Strife from the impulses that he saw mani- fested by all living creatures; Anaxagoras ascribed the origin of motion to NOUS, "Mind," lll and therewith introduced into Greek philosophy the potent notion that the natural world is somehow the result of reason, that reason is not a part of nature nor a product of it but different in kind from it and sovereign over it. Anaxagoras like Empedocles reduced all change to local transla- tion, which, since no void was admitted, was simply rearrangement; and, because the unit in the rearrangement retained its identity, this kind of change seemed to them not to transgress the logic of Par- menides. This Melissus of Samos, the last great Eleatic critic, proved to be erroneous.12 He impugned the mechanism of both systems by arguing that, if there is no void, there cannot be motion of any kind; but he went beyond this to prove that both systems restricted illegiti- mately the law of identity which they professed to respect. If the world exists, its very arrangement, he argued, can change no more "I Frag. der Vorsok.5, 59 B 12, 13, 14. 112 Cf. Crit. Pres. Phil., pp. 402-403.</page><page sequence="24">342 HAROLD CHERNISS than can any of the ingredients of that arrangement. Moreover, process of any kind implies a moment of initiation both temporal and spatial, and that moment involves the appearance of characteristics, at least of arrangement, that did not before exist. This being impos- sible, there can be no differentiation of any kind, from which it follows that what exists must be completely homogeneous and unlimited in extension. The very differentiation of material in the systems of Empedocles and Anaxagoras, therefore, is incompatible with the Par- menidean laws. That differentiation itself implies separation, and separation involves motion; but, motion being impossible, the one means of differentiation which had seemed to remain for those who accepted Parmenides' logic is shown to be inconsistent with it. Finally Melissus pointed out that, since even Empedocles and Anaxagoras had to deny the validity of the evidence of the senses in order to maintain the truth of their theories, the evidence of the senses cannot be adduced against the strict Eleatic position either, for it is in fact admitted by those who would maintain an articulate world of change that the logical laws are stronger than the evidence of sensation. It follows, then, from the very arguments of Empedocles and Anaxago- ras that, if one were to assume a multiplicity of entities, each entity would still have to be what Melissus had declared the one Being to be. Leucippus and his followers accepted this implied challenge.l3 Since there could be no motion without a void, they asserted the exist- ence of a void, a physical non-being; 14 and, inasmuch as Melissus had shown that a commencement of motion contradicts the law of identity, they abandoned such forces as Anaxagoras' Nous and, making explicit the old, naive Ionic assumption, declared that con- stant motion is an unvarying characteristic of all matter. Melissus' proof of the necessary homogeneity of all matter they accepted; and, since the sensations could no longer be defended as true witnesses anyway, they denied that the characteristics apparent in complex bodies had any existence at all. Anaxagoras, by asserting the infinite divisibility of matter, had laid himself open to Melissus' argument that he had no reason to assume difference save for the arbitrary divi- sion which involved an initiation of motion; the Atomists therefore accepted the other horn of the dilemma and assumed that the parti- cles of matter are indivisible and unchangeable, differing from one 113 Cf.

Frag. der Vorsok.5, 68 B 156.</page><page sequence="25">PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY 343 another only in size and shape and, except for their motion, having no other characteristics at all. Since a consistent belief in the reality of characteristics had required Anaxagoras to assert that everything is in everything and Melissus had shown that this amounts to a denial of difference between the whole and the parts, these characteristics were useless encumbrances in a physical construction, and Leucippus simply denied their existence and explained the apparent differences of complex bodies as illusory epiphenomena of the real difference of the number, size, shape, arrangement and position of atoms moving in the void. The Atomic system was the last great construction of Presocratic philosophy. In a sense it can be envisaged as the first such construc- tion, Anaximander's, purged of its indefiniteness and refined by the logic of Parmenides, the subsequent attempts to overcome the critique of Parmenides, and the rebuttal of those attempts by the Eleatic critics, Zeno and Melissus. For all its clarity and simplicity and ele- gance, however, Atomism had very little effect upon the philosophy to follow, for the later attempt of Strato to combine it with Aristo- telianism was abortive and Epicurus' adoption of it reduced it to a utilitarian argument in support of his ethics. Its lack of influence may have been due in part to its rejection of the notion of law and meaning in the world of nature, in part to the fact that it was an arbitrary construction unsupported by evidence and containing within itself no possible sign of its own validity. What reason could it ad- duce for the assumptions on the basis of which it denied the conclu- sions of Parmenides? Not the evidence of the senses, for the senses, which give no indication that there are atoms and void, the Atomists denounced as untrustworthy witnesses. Democritus had to assume that there is a genuine knowledge of the mind that discerns the truth to which the bastard knowledge of the senses cannot penetrate.115 Yet he must have felt uneasily that there is in the Atomic system no justification for such a distinction and no foundation for the intelli- gence which he had to assume; and he has left a fine ironical expres- sion of that feeling, a snippet of a dialogue in which the senses, whose reports have been rejected as mere conventions by the mind that asserts the real existence of atoms and void, reply: " Wretched Mind, who get your evidence from us and then try to overthrow us, our overthrow is your destruction." 116 115 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 68 B 11. 116 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 68 B 125.</page><page sequence="26">344 HAROLD CHERNISS Such a peripeteia in the drama of Greek thought had already occurred. Zeno and Melissus seemed to have shown not only that any possible natural philosophy but also all discursive thought on any subject could be proved self-contradictory by the use of Eleatic logic. The serious hope of accounting for the world on some cosmological principle consistently developed had been extinguished; and such spo- radic attempts as were still made in this direction were like the last meaningless twitchings of a broken habit, uncoordinated repetitions of a pattern of past meaning. Hippo of Samos and Diogenes of Apollonia, who sought to derive the articulate world, the one from water, the other from air, are our chief witnesses to the fact that there were still men who could talk as if Parmenides had never lived, wit- nesses also to the fact that men who are in the forefront of some specialized field of knowledge may in all others be uncritical tradi- tionalists and inconsistent eclectics, for such were both of these men in philosophy, though both had done important and original work in biology and physiology. Others devoted themselves to some speciality such as mathematics or medicine and simply disregarded the funda- mental difficulty with which science as a whole had been confronted; but the attitude of those who at this time claimed the ability and assumed the title of educating all the Hellenes was determined by that difficulty. The threat to reason that Democritus had so ironi- cally made the senses deliver was carried out by Protagoras, against whose dictum that nothing is any more so than so he was himself constrained to argue at length.l7 Protagoras wrote a book attacking the Eleatic dogma of the unity of Being,118 not with the purpose, how- ever, of defending the possibility of an objectively true account of the physical world but in order to show that Eleatic logic can overthrow the Eleatic conclusions as well as the evidence of the senses, that there is consequently no objective canon, and that therefore what appears to be to anyone at any time has just as much and just as little valid claim to be so as what appears at any other time to him, when he is different, or to any other person. Parmenides had enthroned objec- tive truth so far above men that it seemed to be inaccessible, useless, and a mere mocking negation of man and of his world. Protagoras expressly bade men desist from chasing such futile phantoms and reassured them that whatever appears to anyone to be true is true 117 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 68 B 156. 118 Frag. der Vorsok.5, 80 B 2.</page><page sequence="27">PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY 345 when it so appears, though one thing may be more useful than another: man himself, he declared, is the measure of all things."9 The pendant to the relativism of Protagoras was the nihilism of Gorgias, who seized upon the Eleatic method to prove that nothing whatever exists, that it is incomprehensible if it does exist, and in- communicable even if comprehensible.'20 So Eleatic Being, having engulfed the world, appeared to have swallowed itself; and Eleatic logic, having put an end to natural philosophy, seemed to have put an end to itself also. Something, however, was left. To Gorgias and Protagoras and their lesser fellows Eleatic logic, especially as it had been employed by Zeno, seemed to be an instrument for proving and disproving any proposition whatever, an instrument as if made to order for their purpose, which was the instruction of pupils in the art of argument as such. So much of positive influence the work of the Eleatics had upon the so-called Sophists, who, just because of their unconcern for any content, studied and developed and refined the purely formal aspect of Eleatic method and in so doing prepared the instrument of Socratic dialectic. This was the instrument, as the example of the living and dying Socrates was the inspiration, of Plato's genius, whereby the curse of Eleatic formalism was lifted from philosophy and the revelation of Parmenides was read aright; in the light of that revelation a cosmos was restored to man in which the MIND of Anaxagoras, the endless process of Heraclitus, the wandering souls, which Empedocles could not deny and could yet not naturalize in his cyclical mechanism, all found their proper places. In the Timaeus Presocratic philosophy had its resurrection and transfigura- tion, the parts that were meaningless made meaningful in a whole that is far more than their mere summation.
