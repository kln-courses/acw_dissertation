Pp. 2I2. Benrubi's survey of recent French thought appeared in English in an earlier and briefer version as Contemporary Thought in France (New York, Knopf, I926). The present work retains the outline of its predecessor, but is considerably amplified in detail. It includes, for example, and for no good reason, the complete table of contents of the proceedings of the Socift6 Francaise de Philosophie from its incep-</page><page sequence="2">No. 3.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS 289 tion to the end of I925. The author divides contemporary French philosophers into " empirical positivists ", " critical " or " epistemologi- cal " idealists, and " metaphysico-spiritual positivists ", the three groups including respectively the spiritual posterity of Comte, of Kant and Renouvier, and of Maine de Biran. The classification is super- ficial and its application hardly enlightening. Meyerson is to be found among the critical idealists, Lalande appears with the followers of Maine de Biran, and Brunschvicg turns up oddly at the end of a series in which his immediate predecessors include Couturat and Jean Nicod. The German version has rescued Gilson from the very heterogeneous group of "anti-Bergsonians" and given him a more positive status, with Maritain, as a "neo-Thomist". The change, if not wholly satis- fying, is at least an improvement. This book contains useful compila- tions of names and bibliography. It does not present an illuminating analysis of the period it attempts to survey. Professor H6ffding's extension of his theory of the categories to the attractive and little-understood subject-matter of individual philo- sophies of life and of the meaning of life is a minor but not unimportant addition to his philosophy. It is the application of the primary cate- gory of totality-he tells us-to that complex and concrete material of experience which the narrower synthesis of science cannot include, which gives rise to such personal world-views. Such conceptions are diverse, individual, anthropomorphic. They express the poetry of life in its most spontaneous form, and can lay claim to no greater validity than such expression will warrant. But they are important elements in our notions of organism and of personality, and their place in metaphysics and religion is a large one. Their internal structure can be analysed, and this analysis is the central feature of the book. The natural expansion of our ideas through analogy with our own basic standpoints and tendencies-the progressive complication of the resulting view in its attempt to include as much as possible of the diver- sity of experience-the repetition of essential moments in some sort of ordered whole these are the major stages in the development. As always, Professor H6ffding's description includes a wide and generous reference to the best that has been accomplished in his field of investi- gation, and his tolerant appreciation of personal 'philosophies of life' in spite, or perhaps because of, their diversity exemplifies and justifies that relativite philosophique which is of the very essence of his own philosophy. The American reader will note with some interest the philosophic implication of Longfellow's Psalm of Life as the author here presents it.</page><page sequence="3">290 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XL. When an idealist and a rationalist turns to the " psychological bases " of the moral life to find a ground for moral values and a standard by which we may judge them the result is likely to be interesting. Parodi's determination to go as far as possible with positivists and empiricists in this matter is obvious and laudable. Not on pure reason, but on the basic preferences implicit in vital tendency and activity, will he ground his moral theory. And not by an abstract final good but by the conditions and presuppositions of this activity itself will he estimate the meaning of the moral life. It is unfortunate, however, that M. Parodi brings to this investigation all the preconceptions of that Kan- tian doctrine of morality which still represents his own basic conviction on the matter. Hence we are not surprised to learn that vital tendency must be internally directed, that internal direction presupposes con- sciousness, that consciousness must be conceived on the analogy of our own clearest experience, as self-consciousness or judgment, and that to a consciousness thus conceived the rationalistic ideas of 'liberty' and 'universality' are as applicable as ever they seemed to the idealist to be. This universality is now based on the identity of human nature, to be sure, and its standards are translated when possible into sociolog- ical or even biological pseudonyms, but the essential structure of the argument is unaltered. The author's account of education in its relation to morality is perhaps the most valuable portion of the book. On the whole the book adds nothing essential to his position as already extensively outlined in Le probleme moral et la pensee contemporaine. De l'etre is an ambitious treatment of a very extensive subject. The analysis is dialectical and purports to prove, among other things, that Being is all-inclusive, that thought and time are internal to it, that its ubiquitous reality is inescapably present in all its parts, since absence is always subjective, and the like. These are all highly im- portant conclusions, if true, and the argument which supports them is often impressive. We may regret, therefore, that its extremely gen- eral and rarefied character makes it impossible to discover whether any- thing real corresponds to the terms of its analysis and consequently whether any of its assertions has even a chance of being true.
