<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Biblical Literature even Mosaic (p. 47). But earliest Israel was of most heterogeneous origin. It is not made clear just what it was that made these miscellaneous elements into a distinct people and gave them cohesion through the first two centuries of their history. Indeed, in places one feels that the distinction between the two forms of covenant that existed in Israel is blurred as, for example (p. 84), where it is said that David "revived and renewed the Mosaic covenant" by applying it not to Israel, but to himself. But is this the Mosaic covenant at all, and not a covenant of markedly different type? Finally, there can only be praise for the way in which the author gives full attention to religious developments alongside political events. The proph- ets, for example, receive their full share of space. But one feels that they are laid under contribution too largely for their part in the development of religious ideas. Thus Amos and Hosea were "astonishing thinkers" (p. 128) who voiced their criti- cism of society "in more reasoned and intellectual terms" (p. 126) than did their predecessors; Isaiah was "directed by a brain of commanding range and power" (p. 151), while Job and Second Isaiah are discussed under the heading, "The Climax of Hebrew Thought" (chap. 15). All this may well be true enough, but will it help to give the reader a balanced impression of the place and function of prophecy in Israel? In addition, the book is marred by a number of erroneous or incautious state- ments, some of which may be blamed on careless proofreading. The following were among those noticed. It is stated (p. 13) that the Amorites made their appearance "shortly before the end of the second millennium"; obviously "third millennium" was intended. The Philistine town at Tell el-Qasile is placed (p. 68) "on the bank of the River Yarmuk"; was not "Yarkon" intended? It is twice stated (pp. 115-16) that Omri allowed the Arameans to establish trading quarters in Jerusalem; but these were in Samaria. Ahaz is said (p. 138) to have paid "a friendly visit" to Assyria; but we know only of Ahaz's appearance before the Assyrian king in Damascus, and it is to be doubted that this was just a "friendly visit." It is said (p. 139) that Sennacherib took Hezekiah prisoner, but neither the Bible nor Sen- nacherib's inscriptions so state. The kingdom (or tribal confederacy) of Kedar is consistently referred to as "Kebar." These mistakes and others are not likely ser- iously to confuse the careful reader; but it is a pity they could not have been caught.

Pp. xx + 203. $10.95 (paper). This study arises out of the dual conviction that the kind of God in whom one believes is as important as whether one believes in God at all, and that much of what is taught about the God of the OT in the churches today is misleading, or even wrong. "Metaphors matter" (p. 2), and the metaphors dominating contemporary teaching about the OT God are those of lawgiver and judge. As a result, this God is imagined as harsh and cold, and remote from human beings. Remote, also, from the God of the NT. 516</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews For Fretheim, the key to a proper grasp of the OT understanding of God is the idea of humankind as the image of God, and the cluster of anthropomorphic metaphors that reinforce this idea. The "image of God," though it entails viewing the human in theomorphic terms, at the same time "gives us permission to reverse the process and, by looking at the human, learn what God is like" (p. 11). Of course, there are limits. The OT itself rules out thinking about God as mortal, sexual, and lacking in wisdom, for example. Nevertheless, the pervasive anthro- pomorphism of OT language about God demands greater recognition than it ordi- narily receives. Fretheim responds to this demand by pressing the human metaphor of God as far as it will reasonably go. The climax of the effort is an exposition of the suffering of God, especially as it is suggested in the prophetic books. But in order to prepare for this conclusion, the stage is set by discussing several other aspects of the OT understanding of God. Under the heading, "God and World," the following issues are considered: the reality of God's "internal" relationship to the world, God and time (with a critique of the idea of God's foreknowledge), and the presence and power of God (with a critique of conventional views of God's immanence, transcendence, and sover- eignty). Next comes a chapter on "God in Human Form," which covers theophany, prophetic vision, revelatory meteorological phenomena, the divine messenger, and the name of God. This chapter provides a transitional link between the preceding, general discussion of the OT idea of God, and the following treatment of the specific question of divine suffering. This last comprises four chapters: "God Suffers Because," "God Suffers With," "God Suffers For," and "Prophet, Theophany, and the Suffering of God." The final sentence in the book is significant: "God's act in Jesus Christ is the culmination of a longstanding relationship of God with the world that is more widespread in the OT than is commonly recognized" (p. 166). The book is a valuable contribution to biblical theology. It is well-informed, and it presents an extensive running dialogue with other scholarly works, both European and American, not only on the topic of the book itself but also on a host of related issues. The structure of the book is logical and the argumentation clear. In none of its parts is it merely a rehearsal of the views of others, but in all, it puts forth the carefully formed judgments of the author himself-often in distinctive and provocative ways. The margins of my review copy are filled with comments. Although many of these comments involve disagreement with the author, the number and range of them testifies to the value of the book as a stimulus to reflection on the important questions treated. In a brief review it is impossible to describe the particular strengths of the argument in any detail, or to present many specific criticisms. The latter point toward a single, general criticism, which may be worth stating, however. In trying to do full justice to "the humanity of God," as it is expressed and implied in the OT, Fretheim, in my judgment, sometimes goes too far. His inclination is to infer from the human metaphors of God, and especially the idea of God as the image of the human being, analogues of human experience that, although they are not expressly denied to God in the OT, are not explicitly attributed to God either. The underlying rule seems to be that unless there is a clear indication to the contrary 517</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Biblical Literature in the text, the metaphors can be drawn out inferentially as far as the interpreter wants them to go. A related criticism has to do with the interpretation of the prophets as vehicles of revelation. At the end of his discussion of the prophetic figures who lend them- selves most to his interpretation, namely Hosea, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Servant of Yahweh, Fretheim concludes, "God is present and active not only in and through what the prophet speaks, but also in what he does, and, indeed, in who he is" (p. 165). It is true that some of what prophets do in the OT is meant to point to the presence and activity of God. This is the case with the symbolical actions of the prophets. However, it is not at all evident to me that the texts suggest anything more than this, for example, that the general behavior of Jeremiah is transparent to the activity of God. With respect to "who [the prophets are]," I find the argument unconvincing, if this means anything more than that the prophets in some cases (Hosea in his marriage, Jeremiah in his celibacy) shaped major aspects of their behavior and their human relationships in obedience to what they believed to be God's word. In short, I do not see God incarnate in the OT pictures of these men, in the way Fretheim does. There is one other central notion of the book that poses a problem for me. It is that of the "intensifying of divine presence." The argument is that although God, the creator and sustainer of all things, is present everywhere and always, God's presence is "intensified" at some times and places, according to the purposes of God. While I am willing to grant that such language is frequently a useful and legitimate paraphrase of what is meant by the OT writers, I find it more prob- lematic than helpful for expressing Christian faith-as Fretheim seems to want to do (although, the book is not clear on this point). It is one thing to speak about intensified human awareness of -or belief in-the presence of God, but it is quite another to speak about the intensified presence of God. Since Fretheim does not use this language merely to talk about the revelation of the word of God-a usage which would make sense to me-I do not know what else it might mean. The questions I have raised about the book are fairly fundamental ones; however, I do not intend to suggest a negative estimate of the book. On the contrary! As one of the series, "Overtures to Biblical Theology," it is appropriately bold and challenging, inviting vigorous response. It does this very well, indeed. Certainly it succeeds in correcting the inadequate image of the God of the OT that appears to dominate teaching in some quarters of the modern church. In this sense, it achieves its objective admirably. But it does more than this. It advances the theological dialogue among serious students of the Bible on central aspects of the OT witness. James M.
