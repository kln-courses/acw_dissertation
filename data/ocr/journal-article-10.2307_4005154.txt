Photograph courtesy of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, provided by author. O n 1 July 1985 a little-known federal agency, the Bureau of Biological Survey in the Department of the Interior, celebrated its centennial. The event was described in the Washington Post, whose reporter suggested that the Biological Survey was a "struggling, dispirited bureaucratic waif, far from the centers of power." He added that on one recent occasion, the secretary of the interior had congratulated the agency for one of its accom- plishments, but failed to realize that it was, and had been, a part of his department for more than forty-five yearsO It was not always thus. During the agency's heyday in the early years of this century, its first chief, C. Hart Merriam, was a longtime friend of President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1907 political opponents of the Roosevelt administration, knowing the president's interest in Merriam's work, sought to strike at the president by eliminating the budget appro- priation for the Biological Survey. Merriam simply appealed to Roosevelt, who successfully intervened to save the agency. The Bureau of Biological Survey in its earliest form came into being in 1885 as the result of some careful wire pulling by Merriam and some of his associates who were interested in ornithology. When in September 1883 the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) was organized in New York, Merriam, one of the two dozen charter members, was appointed its secretary and chairman of the Committee on the Migration of Birds. He and a small group of volunteer assistants set about collecting bird-migration data sent in by twelve hundred observers in the United States and Canada. Swamped by mounting reams of reports, Merriam soon realized that he would require professional assistance. 1. Boyce Rensberger, "Biological Survey an Orphan at 100,' Wash- ington Post, 1 July 1985. No group of part-time volunteers, no matter how dedi- cated, could handle this assignment. He consulted with the AOU leadership and with Spencer F. Baird, doyen of American ornithologists and secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and decided to appeal for aid from the federal government. The resulting funding request suggested that farmers could benefit from a clearer understanding of the distribu- tion, food habits, and economic impact of the nation's bird population. With the aid of Senator Warner Miller of New York, an old Merriam-family friend, the bill passed the Congress and thereby authorized the creation of an office of Economic Ornithology within the Division of Entomol- ogy of the Department of Agriculture. When asked to recommend someone to head the new agency, the AOU nominated Merriam, and he received an appointment as economic ornithologist. Together with Albert Kenrick Fisher, a classmate in medical school, he entered upon his new duties on 1 July 1885.2 Merriam and Fisher were not the first in the United States to conduct and publish official results of research in ornithology. Massachusetts and Ohio had published lists of birds native to their states as early as 1833 and 1838 respectively. In 1844 a physician named James De Kay 2. Keir B.

S. F. Baird published the first nationwide survey in 1858. Baird's was the first attempt to describe all birds within the present borders of the continental United States. Merriam's ornithological survey was, however, the first comprehensive nationwide survey by a federal agency, although that was not the agency's original charge.3 Within a year Merriam had a budget of ten thousand dollars, had been given responsibility for mammal studies, and was officially concerned with the relationship of birds and mammals to agriculture and forestry. He now reported directly to the commissioner of agriculture. In 1895 the agency was retitled the Division of Biological Survey, and in 1905 became the Bureau of Biological Survey. Merriam continued at the helm for a quarter century.4 Merriam and the Biological Survey When Merriam began his government career, he was a twenty-nine-year-old upstate-New York physician. He was also, however, a lifelong naturalist; he had started collect- ing natural history specimens in his childhood. Encouraged by his father, a successful businessman, banker, and two- term Republican congressman, Merriam built up such an impressive collection of bird skins and other specimens that his father built a frame museum building on the family property. In 1872, at the unusually early age of sixteen, Merriam was placed on one of the govemment's exploring expedi- tions to the Yellowstone by the legendary Spencer E Baird, then assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and director of the U.S. National Museum. Merriam brought back some useful specimens, drafted a workmanlike report, and was urged by Baird to complete his formal education, lest he remain a mere field collector. This Merriam did, in a program culminating with several years at Yale and an M.D. degree in 1879 from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. Merriam's formal education was followed by six years of desultory rural medical practice, with several breaks for natural history work. The breaks included an 1883 trip to collect seal skins in the northern Atlantic, again arranged by Baird.5 Merriam's rather idiosyncratic tenure with the Biological Survey from 1885 until 1910 reflected his own unique set of 3.

By and large, the Washington officialdom with which he dealt did not appreciate his perception of his task, but with the benefit of hindsight, we can appreciate the logic of his position. Merriam had long been interested in the fundamental question of which factors governed the distribution of life in North America. To this long-standing concern he now added a growing realization that much research still had to be done on the nature and extent of the continent's vertebrate fauna and its ethology. His own research interests centered on mammals and birds. Only when much of this foundation work had been done, he reasoned, would it be possible for him to get on with the official mission of his agency. After two very productive decades during which Merriam largely directed the scientific work of the Biological Survey along lines of his own choosing, growing congressional pressures compelled him in 1905 to return to his original charge of helping the nation's farmers deal with environ- mental factors. To this charge were now added leading the federal government's new and somewhat primitive program of wildlife management, as well as overseeing federal conservation and hunting regulations. Merriam soon found this assortment of functions distasteful, and he left the agency in 1910. For the remaining three decades of his active career, supported by a generous lifetime grant from the family of the railroad mogul Edward H. Harriman, Merriam devoted most of his research time to two projects. The first was completing his lifelong effort to reclassify North American bear species; the second was a pioneering anthropological study of disappearing California Indian tribes. Increasing infirmities finally compelled Merriam to give up active research and fieldwork in 1939, and he died in March 1942.6 The Department of Agriculture in Merriam's Time In 1885 and until after the turn of the century, the Department of Agriculture was housed in a red-brick mansard-roofed structure, built just after the Civil War on the Mall in Washington, D.C., about a block west of the Smithsonian. The modest departmental complex was surrounded by rolling grounds, with clumps of trees and flowering shrubs scattered about. The several buildings were old-fashioned but functional, with neat test plots of various cereal, forage, and other plants, a mulberry orchard, and a barnlike structure for raising silkworms and demon- strating silk processing. A frame building housed a large exhibition hall in which various items salvaged from the Chicago World's Fair of 1892 were displayed for many years. On the ground floor of the main building was a primitive lunchroom, and in one attic room of this same structure the taxidermy work of the Biological Survey was done. Known to intimates as the gut shop, this room provided a place where the younger set could loaf, relax, and get away from the close supervision of their dignified elders. Informal athletic contests and exercises were part of the daily round here. The taxidermy operation was later 6. Sterling, Last of the Naturalists, chaps. 3-8. U.S. BIOLOGICAL SURVEY 181</page><page sequence="3">Some Other Biological Survey Personaliltes Many of those who joined Merriam in the early days remained with the Biological Survey for decades. Albert K. Fisher, for example, who worked with Merriam from day one, did not retire until 1931. A stocky, smiling man, he served for a time as assistant chief under Merriam. For nearly a quarter century, however, he was in charge of economic investigations, which meant that he over- saw the agency's programs for controlling predatory animals and noxious rodents. His support for his staff earned their intense loyalty, which may have helped him defer his retirement. He was popular in scientific circles and cultivated most anyone who could be useful to the survey. He authored several classic studies including The Hawks and Owls of the United States (1893)a' Vernon Bailey was a lad of nineteen living on a Min- nesota farm when he wrote Merriam in 1883 to ask about some animals he had encountered. Merriam encouraged him, and in 1886 Bailey mailed in 495 skins, 575 skulls, and 10 pickled specimens, for which Merriam paid him $268.55. Bailey quit farming in 1887, came to work for Merriam at $40 a month, and proved to be Merriam's most indefatigable collector and field agent. His success in collecting numbers of small mammals hitherto almost impossible to find may have triggered in Merriam's mind the idea of a "continental campaign of mammal collecting' something that could not have 1.

In 1910 both were moved to the new Museum of Natural History kitty-corner across the Mall.7 For several years after its inception, the publications of the Biological Survey informed the nation's farmers about the food habits of birds, their patterns of migration and geographic distribution, the economic importance of birds and mammals, directions for sending small-mammal specimens to the agency for study, and the like. A pro- nounced but quiet shift in research emphasis soon took place, however, away from the economic concerns of farmers and toward fundamental inquiries into the various 7.

Bailey's formal education was spotty, though he did attempt some college courses after coming to Washington. Within the first dozen years of his ten- ure, he had turned in detailed reports of his fieldwork in thirty states and parts of Mexico. He married Merriam's sister Florence, herself an ornithologist of note, in 1899, retired in 1933, and kept up with active fieldwork until 1941, the year before his death at age seventy-eight. He turned out at least a dozen major books, including tech- nical revisions of several mammalian genera and biolog- ical surveys of three states. He allowed live jumping mice to run freely about his home in Washington, claiming that it kept down the population of resident cockroaches, of whose presence his wife had been blissfully unaware.2 Mention should also be made of Theodore Sherman Palmer, a graduate of the University of California who came to work for Merriam in 1889. He later earned an M.D. from Georgetown, possibly in emulation of Merriam and Fisher, although he never practiced medi- cine. He did some notable fieldwork and authored a treatise on jack rabbits and a massive index to the genera of mammals before turning to the field of conservation. He founded a branch of the Biological Survey that dealt with regulations concerning the hunting and protection of wildlife, and headed it for a decade. Palmer drafted the preliminary version of the treaty governing the pro- tection of Canadian and American migratory birds, and 2. "Notes on Bailey," Albert K.

Merriam, who had an inherent bent for this sort of work, was responsible for the change. In later years he argued that the change of direction was essential, because his agency could not assist the farmer until it had gained a more comprehensive knowledge of the North American fauna and its relation- ship to the environment, subjects that were at best imper- fectly understood at the time. Although American fauna had been studied for years, Merriam made the first comprehensive effort to master the subject. His arrival in Washington and the development of new methods of collecting mammals, especially the smaller ones, virtually coincided. The "cyclone" or "climax," ancestor of the common snap trap of today, was invented in the mid-1880s. The new collecting methods and the bur- geoning interest in the taxonomy of fauna led to greatly expanded research. In 1884 an authority listed but 363 known species of land mammals in North America; within fifteen years, 182 JOURNAL OF FOREST HISTORY / OCTOBER 1989</page><page sequence="4">helped prepare the first federal regulations under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. He was also involved in the creation of what became the Federal Wildlife Refuge Program, counseled innumerable state legisla- tures as they formulated their game laws, and was a director and vice president of the National Audubon Societies for thirty years. The pioneering conservation- ist William Hornaday said of Palmer in 1913 that his services to game protection were worthy twenty times the annual appropriation for the entire Biological Survey, which had risen by that year to $191,000. Palmer retired from the survey in 1933. His great avocation had to do with compiling the necrology of members of the American Ornithologists' Union, of which he was secre- tary for several decades. This very useful activity earned him the somewhat dubious sobriquet of "Tombstone Palmer."3 Notable among the many individuals who briefly worked with the Biological Survey as collectors or field agents over the years were Frank H. Hitchcock, who became postmaster general in the Taft administration, and Frederick Funston, a congressman's son who later became an army officer, won the Congressional Medal of Honor in the Philippine insurrection, and became a major general. Clarence Birdseye later invented the first products of the frozen-food industry, and Alexander Wetmore rose to become secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.4 3. J. K. Terres to W. L.

Merriam, his staff, and a few others using his methods had increased that number to 1,450. Merriam himself named and described 580 new species and subspecies during his forty years of collection. One of his successors later jested that Merriam had named more animals than had Adam!8 There are basically two types of taxonomists: "splitters," who are alive to the most subtle distinctions between individuals within a group of organisms; and "lumpers," who, as the term implies, accept more generalized group- ings. Merriam was a dedicated splitter; in 1918, for example, he announced that eighty-six species and subspecies of big brown and grizzly bears were to be found in western North America. Modem authorities agree that there are perhaps a 8.

Such discrepancies lower the number of established species named by Merriam, since much of his work was later revised. Nevertheless, mammalogists now recognize about thirty-four hundred varieties of mammals in North Ameri- ca, and despite later revisions of his work, Merriam must be credited as a pioneering modern taxonomist.9 Merriam was also responsible for developing a theory that climatic factors control the distribution of animal and plant life. He based his theory primarily upon warm temperatures, but he also considered humidity, precipita- tion, and topography. In 1889 he conducted a summer-long 9. C.

In 1890 he argued that the animal and plant associations on the slopes of the mountain were arranged in successive bands as one went from its base to its peak. He designated these biogeographic regions "life zones" and suggested that they replicated in microcosm all of the life zones to be found in North America, from the tropical in the south to the boreal and arctic in the north. He briefly explained his rationale for this concept, which was based in part on temperature records from various parts of the continent and in part on animal-plant associations. Although Merriam never got around to publishing the data to support his concept of life zones, he did publish a series of colored maps of North America depicting these biogeographic regions, making minor adjustments based on the research he and other Biological Survey agents had done in the field. Merriam seemed to feel that his research had answered the most basic questions concerning temper- ature distribution and its effect upon wildlife, but this claim proved to be premature. The Weather Bureau later discov- ered that the figures they had given Merriam were about 6 degrees off. Though he admitted that the data were flawed, Merriam never published the correct figuresY0 10. C. H. Merriam, "Results of a Biological Survey of the San Francisco Mountain Region and Desert of the Little Colorado, Arizona' North Later researchers have criticized Merriam's conclusions as simplistic. They point out that he gave insufficient atten- tion to such factors as cold temperatures, soil conditions, the availability of vegetation and other sources of food, physical barriers to dispersal, precipitation, the presence or absence of predator species, and suitable materials for the construction of nests or burrows, to mention a few. Modem biogeographers have worked out much more complex and accurate formulations to account for the various assem- blages of plant and animal communities in North Americas' Nevertheless, Merriam's life-zone concept and colored maps had a profound influence. Authors of Biological Survey publications, as well as mammalogists not on the agency's staff, used the life-zone concept to discuss biogeo- graphic questions until the 1940s. References to life zones can be found in publications dealing with the mammals of western Canada, the United States, and parts of Mexico as late as the early 1960s. This is partly because the concept continues to reflect many of the biogeographical realities of the Southwest, where the concept originated, despite general criticisms of its application elsewhere. As recently as 1981, for example, the distinguished American mammal- ogist E. Raymond Hall stated, in his definitive Mammals of North America, that "the life-zones of Merriam... continue to serve usefully for tabulating numbers of kinds of mammals - fewer kinds toward the North Pole and more kinds toward the Equator.'12 The Work of the Biological Survey in Canada and Mexico Merriam himself came to love the West, particularly California, where he made his summer home from the 1890s until his death in 1942.

But Merriam did not confine his research to the West. Despite limitations of staff imposed by niggardly budgets, by the'time he left government service in 1910, he and his men had done fieldwork in all but four eastern states, seven Canadian provinces and territories, and two dozen of the thirty Mexican states and territories. To those who ques- tioned work done in Canada and Mexico, Merriam could have added that wildlife knows no political boundaries and that international fieldwork was necessary to buttress his distributional theories. A Canadian authority has commented that his country "could boast relatively few competent naturalists of inter- national stature"'3 at the turn of the century, but several of those in the field were strongly influenced by Merriam's work. Ernest Thompson Seton, for example, a British- born naturalist and artist long resident in Canada, collected specimens for Merriam from the 1880s to about 1908. He learned how to describe animals properly from Merriam, and he completed a number of illustrations for publications put out by the Biological Survey. Seton became prominent in the 1890s when he published a series of highly popular and anthropomorphic animal stories, though these occa- sioned criticism from professional naturalists. To refute such criticism, Seton later authored several major nonfic- tion works, one on the mammals of Manitoba in 1909, and another on the game mammals of North America in the 1920s, which won him considerable critical acclaimj4 Mexico was pretty thoroughly covered by two Biological Survey men, Edward W. Nelson and Edward A. Goldman, between 1892 and 1906. Goldman, the California-born son of a farmer, signed on at the age of eighteen in the summer of 1891 with Nelson (then thirty-six) as a helper for $30 a month and board. Goldman was at his desk in the Washington agency several days before his death in 1946, fifty-five years later, though he had by that time been in retirement for several years. Nelson was the third chief of the Biological Survey from 1916 until 1927. Goldman served during World War I as a major in the U.S. Army's Sanitary Reserve Corps, concerned with the eradication of mice and rats. Between them, Nelson and Goldman collected 17,400 mammals, 12,400 birds, "and comparable numbers of reptiles, amphibians ... other classes of animals ... and plants"''15 Their work was sometimes challenging. On one occasion, Goldman was angrily pursued by twenty Mexi- can Indians who thought that he was a government official come to take their lands away. "For ten hours, Goldman stood in the inner room of an adobe hut waiting to fight off the murder-bent natives. The Mexican who owned the hut [finally] convinced the Indians that Goldman was not 13.

Merriam arranged for packages of scientific supplies needed by Nelson and Goldman to pass through Mexican customs without inspection. Though Mexican law forbade it, cartridges for the rifles the two men used were cleverly hidden among the cotton batting and other supplies. Other arrangements had to be made, however, when Mexican customs officials politely wrote Merriam to complain that the cartridges he had been sending Nelson and Goldman did not fit Mexican weaponsY7 The Biological Survey Staff Under Merriam Throughout Merriam's tenure, the Biological Survey staff remained small and their salaries modest because the budget was modest. Total salaries never rose above $17,500 annually between 1885 and 1910, and the total annual appropriation remained under $62,000. Merriam was no politician, and he loathed the annual round of budget hear- ings on Capitol Hill, so many of his people had to be hired on a seasonal or part-time basis. Some employees began working at salaries of $480 per annum or less in the early days, many earned only between $1,200 and $1,800 down to the early 1920s, and Merriam's own salary stood at $2,500 for years08 Biological Survey men typically traveled to their field sites alone, using railroad vouchers issued by the govern- ment. Once in the field, an agent paid his day-to-day costs out of pocket, since in those days the government did not reimburse Department of Agriculture employees for per- diem expenses. In 1895, for example, a field agent might have hired a camp man for $20 to $25 a month and board. The typical camp man might provide a wagon to carry the field equipment, take care of the horses, protect the site while the field agent was out collecting, prepare meals, and provide some human companionship. Provisions for the agent and camp man might have come to $20 a month, although Merriam claimed that he was able to get along on $6 for this purpose. One field agent asserted in 1893, how- ever, that no one could live decently in the west for less than $2 a day. Camp outfits, which included tents, cooking gear, a horse, saddle, and similar impedimenta, also had to be 16.

U.S. BIOLOGICAL SURVEY 185</page><page sequence="7">provided by the field agent, and these might come to $50 or more.'9 The field agent's job was to collect typical plants and animals native to the area where he was working and deter- mine the life zones encountered. He would usually set out traps in a systematic manner, remaining in one place long enough to be reasonably certain of getting a representative collection of each species of mammal, reptile, or other animal. He then had to prepare skins and other specimens for shipment to Washington, where they could be studied at leisure. He had to take thorough notes about the areas covered so that adequate biogeographic summaries could later be compiled. A field agent might cover part of a state in depth or cover several states in the course of a collecting season. It is remarkable that the field agents, mostly young men with little formal training in biology, were generally able to handle their complex assignments competently. On the other hand, the field agents had their detractors. One biologist protested the published biological survey of his state on the grounds that field agents had neither consulted nor referred to "the published works of men resident in the state,' nor even consulted with resident local naturalists. It is true that some of the work of the field agents duplicated research already done, and the published results constituted more of a mammalogical than a full biological survey.20 In the early days, before the Civil Service took a stand on the matter, Merriam hired young men as field agents, many of them with only spotty formal education, and subjected them to his own peculiar brand of on-the-job training. They often got a considerable amount of practical experi- ence in the bargain. J. Alden Loring, for example, was an upstate-New York lad who started as a laborer with the Biological Survey in 1892 at $50 a month because he could not pass the Civil Service examination for field agents. Merriam found that he could make up good skins, however. In his five years with the agency, he completed fieldwork in seventeen states, several western Canadian provinces, and part of Mexico. When Merriam had to furlough him in 1897 for budgetary reasons, Loring was made curator of mammals at the New York Zoological Park at the age of twenty-six. He later collected for the U.S. National Muse- um in Europe and joined Teddy Roosevelt's safari to Africa in 1909. Loring's generally effective performance may have prompted Merriam's objection to the formal university training in zoology available at the time. He argued that old-fashioned fieldwork in natural history was being scanted in favor of laboratory training in such fields as histology and embryology, which tended to blind students "to the principal facts and harmonies of nature.''21 19.

Rusk, Secretary of Agriculture," By the early 1890s, aspirants for jobs as Biological Survey field agents were required to pass Civil Service examina- tions calling for proficiency in technical Latin, German, and French; expertise in the physiography of western North America and in the geographic distribution of mammals, birds, and forest trees; and ability to identify museum specimens. Merriam cautioned the mother of one young man applying for a place on his staff that "ornithology alone ... is a very limited field, and tends to limit a man's mental capacity. It should be supplemented by knowledge in other departments and by a broad general education.?22 Merriam frequently had occasion to chide his field agents for not preparing their specimens in the field proper- ly. Skins that arrived in Washington from the field poorly packed or already rotting were a sensitive subject with him. He excoriated one crew of field agents for one particularly bad shipment, stating with unconscious humor that the agency's reputation "in these respects is now in very bad odor." He wrote scornfully to another field agent, who had evidently run out of arsenic with which to cure his green skins and had used sugar instead, that "the preservative qualities of [this substitute] had not been previously recog- nized by the Division." On more than one occasion, live reptiles sent through the mails by field men escaped in transit, to Merriam's displeasure. Rattlesnakes, tortoises, and turtles that crawled out of broken packing cases and ranged about the Washington Post Office put him in a bad light with the long-suffering authorities there. He admon- ished his people to wrap live turtles firmly in packages "which cannot by any possibility be damaged, unless the turtle himself is smashed, which would require a railway accident.?23 Merriam's Efforts to Educate the Public Merriam was also interested in teaching the public about specimen collecting and preparation. He wrote one field man in 1889, "By all means do missionary work whenever you have a chance in the way of instructing natives how to prepare skins of mammals properly. In the case of full grown people this is usually hopeless, but in the case of boys from fifteen up there is a fair prospect of success.?24 The public could not always understand or appreciate the efforts of the Biological Survey. In February 1895, for example, a reporter for the New York Sun had a good deal to say concerning Merriam's technical treatise dealing with one genus of fossorial rodents known as pocket gophers.25 The reporter congratulated the nation's fortunate farmers both in Loring Papers; Who Was Who in America, vol. 2, 1950, p. 330; C. H. Merriam, "Biology in Our Colleges: A Plea for a Broader and More Liberal Biology" Science 21 (June 1893): 352-55. 22. C. H. Merriam to Mrs. B. W. Loring, 19 July 1890; C. H. Merriam to J. A.

"The Geomyidae Family: or the Pocket Gophers," New York Sun, 20 February 1895. 186 JOURNAL OF FOREST HISTORY / OCTOBER 1989</page><page sequence="8">for having received, through their congressmen, Merriam's 260-page illustrated opus on the genus Geomys. He opined that any farmer's boy of ordinary intelligence could easily commit to memory a photograph in the book detailing the intricate structure and terminology of the pocket gopher skull while watering the cows. The reporter also enjoyed Merriam's distribution maps, which he likened to "a series of potato bugs laid under a quart of spilled raspberries" and which simultaneously gave "the present business address" of the many species and subspecies of pocket gophers. "Happy the farmer's boy who is permitted to learn his gopher geography under such favorable circumstances;' he added. The reporter also took aim at Merriam's writing style: "The farmers for whom the volume had been intended and published cannot be too grateful to the government for this book . . . accompanied by a descriptive text written in the clearest Saxon;' as, for example, this sentence: "The infra- orbital canal is small and does not pierce the root of the zygoma, but is deeply buried in the maxillary passing back- ward and inward from the infraorbital foramen (on the lower side of the muzzle just behind the premaxillary suture) to the deepest part of the orbit, its course being wholly internal to the zygomatic root of the maxillary." "We would not have believed;' concluded the reporter, "before we read Dr. Merriam's book, that the great facts of geo- myidal morphology could be expressed in language so absolutely free from scientific pedantry. It is good and kind of the Department of Agriculture to publish such a popular work in popular language. The farmers must like it. They have got to like it." Merriam Departs Ultimately, publicity of this sort and the increasing rest- lessness of the congressmen holding Merriam's purse strings compelled him to change course. Beginning in 1905, he was obliged to take men away from the biological surveys and put them back to work on economic studies. The agency was forced to answer the growing demands from ranchers and stockmen in the West for eradication of wolves, coyotes, and other predators by forming a new division devoted to this activity and to the control of noxious rodents. If the taxonomy of mammals was then in its infancy, wildlife management was then in its fetal stage, as Morgan Sherwood has so aptly expressed it, and evi- dently very few considered the possible consequences of the predator-control policy that was to bring the Biological Survey unending headaches and much negative publicity in later years.26 The agency also became responsible for enforcing laws on the importation of exotic animals and the protection of migratory birds. It was called upon to administer the game laws in the territory of Alaska. 26.

By 1910 Merriam had had enough of these economic and regulatory chores, and he resigned. He accepted an offer of $12,000 per annum in salary and research funds for life, four times his Biological Survey income, from the widow of railway magnate Edward H. Harriman, for whom he had organized a scientific expedition to Alaska in 1899. Many assumed that Merriam would now turn his attention to completing his lifework on bears, but he flabbergasted almost everyone who knew him by devoting most of the next thirty years to studying the vocabularies of disappear- ing Indian tribes in California. After Merriam's departure, appropriations for the Bio- logical Survey shot up, reflecting increased national atten- tion to conservation and wildlife management. By the end of the 1920s, the agency was receiving in excess of $1 million a year.27 The Biological Survey went through difficult times in the 1920s due to faltering leadership, a failure to resolve an alarming decline in the nation's migratory-duck popula- tion, and the lack of any clear policy balancing enforce- ment of game laws and the imposition of bag limits with pressures from hunters and sportsmen. Only the intro- duction of duck stamps and the purchase of additional wetlands and refuges in the 1930s settled much of the duck- management problem. Other debates that began during this era continue to the present day, including the contro- versy over the poisoning, trapping, and hunting of predators. By the mid-1930s the Biological Survey once again had able leaders who guided it through the difficult depression years. In a 1939 reorganization, the agency was combined with the old Fish Commission in the Commerce Depart- ment, and both were transferred to the Department of the Interior as the Fish and Wildlife Service. Though many of the old Biological Survey programs continued under the reorganization, the name itself disappeared in 1951, only to surface several years ago as the name for the Museum Section of the National Fish and Wildlife Laboratory. The several dozen scientists and staff members now serving the newly reinstituted Biological Survey can contemplate a rich heritage of accomplishment.28 A 27. William H.
