<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CHAPTER FIVE Conclusions and Policy Implications To consider the role of criminal law in the corporate context, we first  described how the concept emerged. Originally, corporations were not  criminally liable at all because of the intensely personal moral evalua- tion associated with criminal law and its general requirement of indi- vidual criminal intent. As restrictions on corporate criminal liabil- ity fell in the late 19th century, critics frequently decried the odd fit  between the intentionality usually required in criminal law and corpo- rate prosecutions. Yet despite this opposition, prosecutors, legislatures,  and judges have long upheld these prosecutions, primarily on prag- matic grounds. Criminal penalties are justified, according to this view,  not only because they are a useful incentive but also because criminal  behavior that occurs within a corporation is otherwise very difficult to  detect and prevent. With this justification, corporate criminal liability  and criminal liability for corporate officers without requiring criminal  intent has gradually expanded in the past 150 years. This pragmatic  justification for criminal liability has important implications that we  discuss in this chapter. We next turned to developments in this area in the past 30 years.  The Federal Sentencing Guidelines began a shift toward reforming cor- porations from within by developing compliance programs and struc- tural reform. At first, this occurred as a condition of probation after  a corporation was convicted, but gradually the incentives to having a  robust compliance program have increased and are often relevant to the  decision as to whether to prosecute a case in the first place. The down- fall of Arthur Andersen as the result of a conviction on a legal theory  97 </page> <page sequence="2"> 98    The Changing Role of Criminal Law in Controlling Corporate Behavior that was subsequently rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court highlighted  the risks of going to trial for corporate directors and of unintended col- lateral consequences for prosecutors. DPAs and NPAs boomed in its  aftermath but have created their own complications. Finally, we examined the available data to identify trends in the  use of the criminal law in this context. We found that, in general,  formal prosecutions are declining in number across a broad range of  areas. Two important exceptions, however, are prosecutions under  SOX and the FCPA, which have both become more common. We also  noted a huge growth in the number of DPAs and NPAs and the sub- stantial recent increase in debarment proceedings. Our analysis suggests that we may have reached an odd juncture  in the history of the use of criminal penalties in the corporate context.  Corporations and their directors are hesitant to directly challenge pros- ecutorial theories for fear of the collateral consequences. The federal  government is independently increasing debarment and suspension  proceedings in an effort to minimize waste and fraud. The result is the  huge increase in NPAs and DPAs, which lack many of the key benefits  of public law. Given that so many investigations are settled even before  the formal filing of criminal charges, there is little or no judicial over- sight over prosecutorial decisionmaking and case resolution, no formal  fact-finding, and no development of the law. With little oversight, cor- porations may sometimes face pressure to effectively investigate and  develop cases against individual wrongdoers. The result has been a  kind of privatization of corporate criminal law. What Lessons Can We Draw for Policymakers? Whatever the ultimate merits of the institution of corporate criminal  liability, the genie is long out of the bottle, and arguments about abol- ishing the institution of corporate criminal liability are likely of inter- est only to theorists. Still, policymakers should be cautious about the  use of criminal law in this context. Although it may be understandably  tempting to criminally punish corporations that wield great power,  legislators and prosecutors should recognize the complications inher- </page> <page sequence="3"> Conclusions and Policy Implications    99 ent in applying the criminal law to a legal fiction. The temptation to  punish a “bad” corporation can lead to harming thousands of innocent  stakeholders who were completely blameless. Although the pursuit of  corporate criminal liability may be a useful tool to discover and deter  criminal activity by individuals within organizations, the kind of moral  condemnation that is usually associated with a criminal penalty is not  typically useful in thinking about the culpability of a large entity.  Anthropomorphic thinking—attributing individual moral states to  an organization—can obscure the true culpability (or lack thereof) of  individuals. Individual criminal liability absent criminal intent poses its own  complications. Although the urge to use the criminal law to hold some- one responsible for the consequences of his or her actions is under- standable, we should remember that the requirement of criminal intent  has been central to our collective understanding of criminal sanctions.  Exceptions to the general rule that the criminal law requires criminal  intentionality should remain exceptions. Although criminal intent is  not an absolute prerequisite to criminal liability, it is no coincidence  that it has remained a central part of Anglo-American criminal law.  Exceptions to this general rule should remain narrowly tailored to  address specific dangers. Recognize That Criminal Sanctions Are Instrumental Tools and Not  Moral Judgments Although, as many have long argued, criminal liability may be a  useful tool in the organizational context, we must recognize it as just  that—an instrumental tool. The theory that an offending organization  deserves punishment in a retributive sense makes very little sense. The  entity Arthur Andersen was prosecuted, but thousands of individual  people were effectively punished. It is difficult to construct any kind of  principled argument that they deserved to be so. Instead, they should  be recognized as collateral damage in an effort to provide incentives  for corporations to self-police and identify individual wrongdoers.1  1 This kind of collateral damage is not unprecedented—the criminal law inflicts this quite  regularly whenever the law imprisons a parent, partner, or caretaker. But at least in the indi- </page> <page sequence="4"> 100    The Changing Role of Criminal Law in Controlling Corporate Behavior Similarly, we should recognize that a prosecution of an individual for  actions or inactions of others is generally not a moral condemnation of  that individual and should not be understood as such.2 The fact that criminal law in this context is primarily justified  by its instrumental functionality has important implications. If crimi- nal law is used and justified as an instrumental tool in this context,  we should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of its use. This kind  of cost–benefit analysis is often not done in the criminal law context  because of the noninstrumental function of criminal law. We morally  condemn and prosecute murderers because murder is wrong—not pri- marily because it is efficient to do so. But if we are using criminal law  principally to create corporate governance incentives, we should think  carefully about whether the benefits outweigh the costs. The instinct  to punish “bad” corporations can prevent us from conducting this  analysis. Similarly, we should carefully scrutinize the temptation to punish  individuals associated with a bad event absent proof of criminal intent.  Although it may be tempting to want to find someone to punish in the  wake of a bad event, such punishment also may not be the most effec- tive way to ensure compliance. Although the benefits of using criminal penalties to provide  instrumental incentives are obvious, the costs may be less so. The col- lateral consequences of prosecuting a corporation criminally can be  vast and hard to predict. Criminally punishing individuals who are  guilty of poor judgment or bad luck or for the actions of their employ- ees may create incentives, but only at the cost of diluting the collective  significance of the criminal sanction. vidual context, the individual moral condemnation associated with the criminal law is more  understandable and reflects our collective judgment better than the incidental punishment  of stakeholders. 2 Conventional criminal law also contains doctrines that sometimes apply criminal pen- alties to those without criminal intent. For example, the felony-murder doctrine makes an  accomplice in a felony guilty of murder if someone is killed during the commission of the  felony, even if the accomplice did not intend for anyone to die during commission of the  crime. Such doctrines are often criticized for many of the same reasons laid out here. </page> <page sequence="5"> Conclusions and Policy Implications    101 What circumstances might justify the use of criminal sanctions  in the corporate context? Here, we might learn from conspiracy law.  Neal Kumar Katyal has argued that the unique organizational dangers  of criminal conspiracies justify elements of conspiracy law that have  often been criticized (including aspects of strict liability).3 Policymak- ers interested in controlling corporate malfeasance should reserve the  use of criminal law to target the particular dangers of illegal activity  within larger organizations. More specifically, the enormous advan- tages of specialization can make criminal activity within organizations  much more dangerous than that of an individual operating alone. The  power of an individual criminal is much more limited than that of one  operating in conjunction with others. Similarly, the unique social psy- chological effects of groups can make it more difficult for an individual  to resist social pressure within an organization. Exceptions to the gen- eral rule of individual criminal liability should be carefully tailored to  such dangers. Prosecutors must also recognize the complications in this area.  This includes recognizing that the enormous leverage they possess  can create incentives for corporations and outsourced investigations  to identify scapegoats. They must also recognize the risk of collateral  damage to innocent parties. Although this is always a risk in criminal  law—defendants often have innocent families who are deeply dam- aged by the state’s action—the diffusion of harm to innocent parties in  this context can be different. Have Judges Review Deferred and Nonprosecution Agreements Partly as a result of recognizing the limitations of the formal use of  criminal law, use of DPAs and NPAs has skyrocketed. These agree- ments avoid some of the harms associated with using the criminal law  that we have described. But many of the very things that make these  agreements attractive to both corporations and prosecutors raise their  own problems. The lack of judicial oversight over the agreements have  led to concerns about their scope, conflicts of interest, and the institu- 3 Neal Kumar Katyal, “Conspiracy Theory,” Yale Law Journal, Vol.  112, June 2003,  pp. 1307–1398. </page> <page sequence="6"> 102    The Changing Role of Criminal Law in Controlling Corporate Behavior tional competence of prosecutors to mandate potentially far-reaching  changes in business practices. These problems are best remedied by  judicial oversight. Just as a plea agreement has to be reviewed by the  relevant judge, so should NPAs and DPAs. This would provide some  assurance that the agreements are genuinely in the public good and  might allow third parties who are affected by the agreements (e.g.,  individual defendants) to have objections heard in a neutral forum.  Such review should include the factual basis of the agreement, fairness  to third parties, genuine independence of the monitor, and nexus of  the terms of the agreement and the alleged wrongdoing. Policymakers  should give serious consideration to requiring that DPAs and NPAs  be reviewed by an appropriate federal judge. This would provide addi- tional oversight and transparency and reassure the public that justice  was being served. Carefully Review Debarment Provisions The interaction of the enormous growth in the criminal law with debar- ment provisions can also lead to unintended consequences. Debarment  proceedings are typically initiated by agencies that do not want to do  business with organizations convicted of crimes. Yet debarment provi- sions have led to rational corporations being unwilling to take even  strong cases to trial for fear that the viability of the company itself may  be at stake. As a result, the de facto law becomes what the most aggressive  prosecutor in the most aggressive jurisdiction says it is. This sidesteps  judicial oversight and the public quality of criminal law. The lack of  litigation also halts the development of the common law. Rather than  being provided guidance through a series of appellate decisions from  neutral Article  III judges with lifetime tenure, stakeholders are left  only with guidance from prosecutors who are beholden to the more- political, elected executive branches. Debarment provisions that automatically require a licensing  agency or an entity of government to refuse to do business or refuse to  license a corporation upon the corporations’ indictment or conviction  should be carefully reviewed by policymakers. Rather than a per se rule  that requires this potentially catastrophic outcome for the corporation,  </page> <page sequence="7"> Conclusions and Policy Implications    103 the relevant governmental agency should make the decision on a case- by-case basis, subject to appeal to the federal courts, depending on the  severity of the allegations made and their relevance to the domain of  the governmental entity. Substitute the Use of Civil Sanctions Can civil sanctions serve as an important substitute? Historically,  civil penalties have lacked the formal expressive function of the crimi- nal law.4 As the most serious formal sanction that a jurisdiction can  impose, criminal convictions represented a particular collective moral  judgment about the wrongness of an act that a civil sanction lacked.  Yet, as noted above, this kind of collective moral judgment fits oddly  with the legal fiction of a corporation.5 And with the rise of NPAs and DPAs, some of these character- istics of a criminal sanction have disappeared. NPAs and DPAs often  do not require a formal admission of guilt or, in some cases, any public  acknowledgment of wrongdoing. They completely avoid the public  expressive rituals of the courthouse and the oversight of a federal judge.  In these ways, NPAs and DPAs lack some of the conventional benefits  of a public criminal sanction. There may, therefore, be a role for a civil sanction that includes  explicit fact-finding and a finding of culpability on the part of the orga- nization. Historically, the SEC has settled civil fraud charges while  allowing a company to neither admit nor deny the charges.6 However,  4 Khanna, 1996, p. 1497 (noting that the unique sanctioning characteristic of criminal law  is its stigmatizing effect). This was particularly true when the SEC routinely permitted cor- porations to settle civil fraud charges while neither admitting nor denying charges. 5 Khanna has noted that corporate criminal sanctions may have developed because, when  they developed, the modern administrative state necessary to use civil sanctions had not been  developed. In other words, our reliance on criminal rather than civil sanctions is, in part, an  accident of history (Khanna, 1996, p. 1486: “Given the absence of widespread public civil  enforcement prior to the early 1900s, corporate criminal liability appears to have been the  only available option that met both the need for public enforcement and the need for corpo- rate liability”). 6 Senator Elizabeth Warren has recently questioned the SEC’s practice of settling civil  fraud charges without admitting or denying the charges (Andrew Ackerman, “Sen. Warren  Targets Wall Street Settlements,” Wall Street Journal Washington Wire, May 14, 2013; see  </page> <page sequence="8"> 104    The Changing Role of Criminal Law in Controlling Corporate Behavior the new chair of the SEC, Mary Jo White, has recently announced  that, at least in some cases, the SEC will require the corporation to  admit wrongdoing.7 This may increase the ability of civil fines to fulfill  the expressive function of law by combining formal fact-finding and an  admission of wrongdoing—two elements that are absent from criminal  allegations resolved with NPAs and DPAs.8 Ideally, such a sanction would sidestep the hard-to-predict col- lateral consequences that are associated with criminal sanctions. Simi- larly, by categorizing the sanction as civil, we might avoid some of the  long-noted odd disjunctures between the religious origins of the crimi- nal law’s focus on individual culpability and the legal fiction of a cor- poration, including the temptation to anthropomorphize the corpora- tion. And it might serve as a more attractive intermediate sanction—a  way of providing regulators a smoother continuum of possible punish- ments between the severity of criminal penalties or the tap on the wrist  of a nominal fine paid without any admission of wrongdoing. Criminal  sanctions should still be retained for cases of individual wrongdoing  where there is the appropriate mens rea. The rationale for the applicability of the criminal law in this area  has long been pragmatic—that it was necessary to identify wrongdoing  cloaked in the opacity of an organization. Yet it is unclear why criminal  sanctions are uniquely suited to that role. Civil sanctions of significant  magnitude and severity might serve that function just as well as, if not  better than, criminal sanctions. Structural reform and compliance pro- grams could be motivated by enhanced civil rather than criminal sanc- tions. And by not having quite the collateral consequences associated  with criminal penalties, civil sanctions are more likely to face appro- priate challenge by companies and their directors. This would advance  also Samuel  L. Buell, “Potentially Perverse Effects of Corporate Criminal Liability,” in  Anthony S. Barkow and Rachel E. Barkow, eds., Prosecutors in the Boardroom: Using Criminal  Law to Regulate Corporate Conduct, New York: New York University Press, 2011, pp. 87–109,  arguing generally for increased use of civil sanctions). 7 However, most will still be resolved on the conventional terms (James B. Stewart, “S.E.C.  Has a Message for Firms Not Used to Admitting Guilt,” New York Times, June 21, 2013). 8 On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the SEC, which has  jurisdiction only over publicly traded companies listed on U.S. exchanges. </page> <page sequence="9"> Conclusions and Policy Implications    105 the development of the common law and further the public benefits of  litigation in clarifying the law. In some ways, our current system of nominally criminal enforce- ment already resembles a civil system (albeit one with a very power- ful regulatory authority). Formal criminal proceedings are very rare,  almost no one is incarcerated, and the most common outcome is some  kind of company-funded enhanced compliance program—a de facto  fine. The heightened standard of proof that typically distinguishes  criminal from civil cases is all but irrelevant because cases are settled  early—not in the shadow of criminal trial, but in the shadow of the  collateral consequences of indictment. So what difference does it make whether we label the regime  criminal or civil? More than 20  years ago, Yale Law School Dean  Abraham S. Goldstein noted the complexity of applying the right set  of procedures, particularly with civil and criminal concepts mixed: The challenge now is to . . . recognize that each civil and crimi- nal remedy is part of a network of sanctions designed to control  deviant behavior, to provide screening mechanisms to determine  which sanction should be brought to bear, and by whom, in order  to make law enforcement more effective overall; and to create the  hybrid procedures uniquely appropriate to each of these hybrid  processes. If we do not succeed in meeting this challenge, there  is a genuine risk that the stigma and sanctions associated with  “crime” will be imposed, in both civil and criminal processes, on  persons who are not culpable in any widely accepted sense of that  term. If that happens, if offenders who do not match the public  image of criminality are too casually found to be criminal, the  “crime” label will lose its incremental utility, the moral force of  the criminal sanction will be dissipated, and many more people  will suffer unjust treatment.9 Goldstein’s fears remain germane. A complex web of laws and reg- ulations creates incentives for corporate and individual behavior that is  9 Abraham S.

Adjusting one strand in the web, even for the best  of reasons, can lead to unanticipated consequences. It seems unlikely,  for example, that the prosecutors involved in the Andersen cases antici- pated that their actions would lead to the rise of NPAs and DPAs and  the reduced transparency that has resulted. To improve behavior in and  by organizations, we may have relied too heavily on sanctions labeled  “criminal” in recent years. This has led to corporations and directors  being reluctant to litigate, at a cost of the development of the common  law and public transparency. By relying more on civil sanctions, the  U.S. justice system might be better harmonized in this unique context.  A more cautious approach to the use of criminal sanctions would pre- serve the expressive power that criminal sanctions should possess. </page> </plain_text>
