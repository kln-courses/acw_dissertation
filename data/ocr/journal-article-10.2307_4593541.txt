<plain_text><page sequence="1">- - ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~ ------- ---- Summaries of Selected Papers from the 96th Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association and related organizations- Detroit, Mich., November 11-15, 1968 yS f A INDS OF CHANGE in the nation and in public health were reflected in the topics of papers and in conversations among the 5,281 persons attending the 96th annual meeting of the American Public Health Association. Clearly, public ihealth practitioners as well as a great many other Americans were preoccupied with poverty, the plight of cities, alienated youth, effects of malnutrition, shoirt- ages of health manpower, and the intricacies and pit.falls of comprehensive, coordinated planning. NEW MISSIONS for the public health disciplines and techniques of accomplishment were ex- plored in sessions entitled "Medicaid in New York: Utopianism and Bare Knuckles in Pub- lic Health," "Drug Abuse Among Youth and Preventive Approaches," "The Need for Nutri- tion Education: Are We Failing the Commu- nity? " "Too Many People: the Diminishing Lebensraum," "Opportunities, Challenges, and Problemfs in Consumer Participation," and "The Urban Crisis and Public Health." THE ASSOCIATION itself moved strongly into new concerns. Evidence of this were the resolutions approved at the 1968 meeting. The Association took positions on the following subjects: health and poverty; abortion; health, welfare, and hunger; health affairs and the Congress; en- dorsement of the Kerner report; neighborhood health centers; and credentials for health occupations. IN TIFIS 17th annual special report on the an- nual APHA meeting are summaries of 146 papers. Since more than 500 papers were given in Detroit, necessarily we have been selective. Copies of some papers were not available, some papers defy summarizaltion, and some authors were planning early publication of their papers in scientific journals. Neveritheless, the follow- ing pages contain a, representative sampling of the concerns of public health on the brink of the 1970's. Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 189</page><page sequence="2">Public Health in the Future "Mini-World" Creators Shut Out Complexities We are in a worldwide confronta- tion of the haves and the have-nots, declared L. J. Duhl, professor of pub- lic health and urban social policies, University of California, Berkeley. In the process, he said, the definition of have-nots has been changing from "those who do not have the economic wherewithal" to "those who do not have the ability to !command events affecting their lives"-implying a change in conce.pt. It is becoming in- creasingly clear that individual com- petence is one proof of having "made it" in our society. The new dichotomy is between those who want -to retain their world as they have perceived and run it, avowed Duhl, and those who are concerned with and demand basic changes now-in the worlds of finance, business, education, and health. Our society is becoming more and more preoccupied with immediate surroundings, Duhl said. People are concerned with the requirements that make daily life more habitable, safe, and comfortable; they are con- cerned with rapid response to an ex- pressed need. We are seeing a vast increase in "mini-worlds" in which people live-worlds created ariound people's homes and work or other functional areas where they are in- volved. Because of their primary concern with these mini-worlds, they approach the large complexities of social policy not with understanding but with a view to facilitating their personal requirements. Since supraordinate rules, like the Constitution of the United States, require the parts (that is, the States) to cede autonomy, negotia- tions will be difficult, Duhl averred. We are not dealing with well-defined, unchangeable groups, an'd no one can negotiate for uncreated groups. Since few really respect anything other than their immediate worlds- the mini-worlds they have created- their ability to identify with broader interest groups remains undeveloped. Demands for Equity In health, as in everything else, Duhl said, I see the pressure for in- creased rationalization of a system as yet nonexistent. The demand for equity comes from inside and outside our professions. The well-to-do have found that money alone cannot buy truly adequate care. The poor have exposed the inequities of the sys- tem-its denegation of people who were considered useful only if they were "good" icharity cases for medi- cal study. To join the medical stu- dents in attacking this "health non- system" is to attack not medicine per se but only some of its past values and methods. Only a few years ago insurance carriers einerged as key figures in our medical care system, said Duhl. Business and labor have asked for service in new forms. Society is slowly redefining medical care, rationalizing the system, and encouraging equity; in short, redefin- ing the function and providence of the health professional and institu- tion. The possibility of tuition grants for education, guaranteed incomes for the poor, and block grants to local, functional, and geographic communities should lead in a com- petitive market economy to increased "consumer ability to buy" services, declared Duhl. Heretofore the mar- ket mechanism has not worked in the field of health because little choice has existed; now, however, the consumer who expresses his desires through economic choice makes himself felt and stimulates the appropriate health institutions. Nonmedical Controls More regulatory agencies will de- velop increasing control over the operations of the new health market, Duhl maintained. Hopefully these agencies will not be controlled by prime business interests. In the years to come, the consumer and his advocates will play an increasingly important role in the regulatory apparatus. Ralph Nader is a case in point-and a hint of what may follow. If the number of physicians prac- ticing today remains unchanged, said Duhl, in 10 years an additional 3 to 15 million associated health person- nel will be required to perform auxiliary services. Medical costs will spiral, but new, supplemental, or al- ternative measures are possible to stem rising costs. The modern hospital need not per- form all the functions that it has assumed, Duhl said. Nexw institu- tions have been developed: hospital- oriented motel chains, day hospitals, night hospitals; these are but a few of the existing institutions created to lower total medical costs. When payments by insurance carriers can fund more services that are not re- stricted to hospitals, we will be as- sisted in reassigning hospital costs to less expensive institutions. Costs will not go down until a vast num- ber of new institutions are created, he said. The cost of research on the deliv- ery of care and its relationship to the broader society must be given high priority in our budgets, de- clared Duhl. Assessment and feed- back will be less concerned with mor- bidity and mortality and more with quality control, ciomprehensiveness, equity, and evaluation of the results of services rendered. Geographic communities will con- tinue to be the concern of those who need a power base. Politicians of all kinds require them, said Duhl. They permit blacks and whites to negoti- ate as equals. The effectiveness of the confrontation by the have-nots, who are increasingly supplemented by those who act as if they were have-nots, will depend on the politi- cal power generated from geographic or functional community bases. The black person, the teacher, the nurse, and the student are just a few of those now building this form of po- litical strength. Their potential po- litical power, Duhl said, unlike power based on money, depends not on what ithey have but on what they potentially can do to the system. 190 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="3">Schools of Public Health Must Relate to Society If schools of public health are to do their basic job, some arrangement with other teaching institutions is required, said Dr. George James, president of Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York City. Only the most ultraconservative observer, looking over our total health estab- lishment, said James, could conclude that it is working so well no change is needed. There is overwhelming evidence, he said, that unless we im- prove the system organizationally and make better use of our human and material resources, we will be unable to bring high-quality care to to those who need it. There is real pressure to teach professionals to fit into the situation "like it is" and "like it will be." I would like to see a further inte- gration of schools of public health into the day-to-day teaching in ulni- versities and medical schools, James said. The schools of public health are a kind of bridge between the scientist-or at least the p'hysi- cian-and laymen. This is not so much because so many laymen ac- tually are to be found in these schools, he continued, but because the schools have reached a sort of conceptual fusing point between lay and professional ideas. Many of the health problems of today and to- morrow will require the cooperation and effort of laymen, said James. Laymen in Congress, on hospital boards, and elsew'here make basic medical decisions. It is impossible to give them "instant education" every time a new subject comes up, he con- tinued. Therefore, we need to give new attention to training lay leaders in the health fields, and the schools of public health in the university setting, said James, have the prime role to play in this training. The school of public health must welcome the opportunity to be rele- vant to society, declared James. As it accepts the challenge, it must re- member to develop its image by tak- ing the following actions. 1. Drawing upion all required disciplines. 2. Highlighting research in a broad front. 3. Searching for true health needs instead of being diverted solely by citizen demands. 4. Accepting the challenge of con- tinuing education for the citizen, es- pecially the community leader, as well as for the professional. 5. Being the active conseience of society in the steady pursuit of quality. 6. Aeting as ombudsmen for as yet unborn generations by insuring that a significant portion of today's re- sources are allocated to research. 7. Expressing concern for the human problems related to the march of science and stating the ethical principles by which we should be guided. 8. Insuring that accurate scientific nledical content accompany all polit- ically inspired medical care pro- grams and insisting that these have skilled medical guidance and evaluation. 9. Joining with a host of other units of the university in supporting the efforts for health. 10. Risking and living through the inevitable defeats in the pursuit of what we believe to be right. If we can develop these, said James, the school of public health will have a brilliant future. If, on the other hand, he warned, the school of public health seeks only to teach the facts of medical care, the disci- plines of epidemiology and statistics, the principles of administration, the present truths of maternal and child health, then it must beware. Many another unit of the university can and will learn to do these-at least well, he said. Moreover, a major and essential personality will then have been lost to the American scene. America needs this personality, James declared. Togetherness: What Can Be Done About It? From dwelling units and numerous other sources in urban areas, siolid wastes are being produced at the rate of about 5 pounds a day per person, reported Dr. Richard A. Prindle, Assistant Surgeon General, Public Health Service-presently on leave as Federal Executive Fellow, the Brookings Institution, Washing- ton, D.C. The volume will increase, he said; even simple arithmetic shows this. Another 100 million per- sons in the last third of this century will increase the production of solid wastes by 50 percent, or to more than 91 million tons per year. The Public Health Service has es- timated that the production of solid wastes will be 8 pounds a day per person by 1980. On this basis, the annual total would be 146 million tons, or almost double our present load. As if this were not enough, siaid Prindle, the Service's Bureau of Solid Wastes Management has pointed out that the per capita pro- duction of urban solid wastes is in- creasing geometrically-and hence these projections may be too low. Industry, agriculture, mining, and government also produce s o 1 i d wastes-about 115 million tons an- nually, Prindle reported. Currently, the production is about 96.2 pounds per person, or 3.5 billion tons an- nually, costing us ablout $3 billion for what, he said, one must admit is a very inadequate sfystem of dis- posal. Too many wastes from municipali- ties, industry, and mining operations, Prindle said, are left as unsightly piles strewn across the landscape, and generally add to the deteriora- tion of surface, ground water, and air. Estimates indicate that 4,570 pounds of contaminants are dis- charged daily by incineration in urban areas for every 100,000 per- sons; 50,400 pounds if burning dumps are the means of disposal. The total load from these sources may be any- where from 7 to 32 percent of the community's total pollution, said Prindle, depending on the "mix" of sources in a metropolitan area. Prindle also discussed a planned society. As the population increases, he said, as more and more people move into our already over-crowded cities and "slurbs," as the attendant pollution rises, and as the environ- ment deteriorates, evidence seems to require increased planning and care- ful thinking to avoid more mistakes and their dire consequences. But what are we to plan for? asked Prindle. This question is rarely faced, he said. It's a hard question, and certainly one that we cannot Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 191</page><page sequence="4">answer immediately. In the many ar- ticles and discussions urging compre- hensive and ecologically oriented planning, rarely has the human side been addressed. What kind and size of population are we planning for? Is continued growth necessary? de- sirable? inevitable? Should we seek an optimum? We are faced with increasing con- trols on the slize and location of our residential lots, Prindle continued, our use of recreational areas, with increased traffic and commuter times, and with rising costs from control and taxes in attempting to regulate and ameliorate our problems. Yet with a continuing deterioration of our environment and quality of life, said Prindle, isn't it about time that we looked deeper into causes and solutions? The increasing technological de- velopment, and to some extent the ''progress at all costs" philosophy that too many pursue, may well pre- sent causes, he declared. We need to ask ourselves if the rising gross na- tional product is always a good thing-especially when this rise is accounted for by increased sales of alcohol, tranquilizers, and cigarettes. Unless we wish to live in a com- pletely ordered State of the most restrictive type, Prindle said, we must begin to discuss and plan the optimum population and a national policy designed to achieve it. Our responsibility to ourselves, future generations, and the total biosphere that is our world requires it. The Diminishing Lebensraum In his paper on the effects of dim- inishing living space, Dr. Hale H. Cook, assistant professor of commu- nity medicine, Temple University Medical School, Philadelphia, made the following observations, which are pertinent to the questions of what happens to freedom as "lebens- raum" decreases. Human beings, given a choice, de- clared Cook, tend to congregate in communities to live-even thougl they may go off into uncrowded fields to work. Concentrations as high as 30,00( persoins per square iiile can occur in agrarian economies, he said. Indus- trialization miakes possible concen- trations as high as 90,000 persons per square mile-and this, he said, probably is not the ultimate limit. In such density ranges one sees correlations which suggest that the internally developed changes in so- cial and sexual behavior, aindI the in- creases in infant mortality seen in rat colonies where other limiting fac- tors (lack of food, presence of dis- ease, or predators) are controlled, may be expected to increase among human beings at population densi- ties significantly greater than these. The desire for individual freedom tends to be submerged by the de- mnands for group conformity and the security of group conformity in populations of moderate to great den- sity. That this is a universal tend- ency, said Cook, or even a very strong one at these levels, is belied by the observation that eccentrics are just as common in cities as in rural areas. Industrialization not only makes possible but requires urban concen- trations of people, Cook said. Certain freedoms (attending the best theaters, hearing the best sym- phony orchestras, visiting the best art museums) are only practical in urban settings; other freedoms, per- haps more basic, such as the freedom to remain healthy, require a rather high degree of industrialization. Discovery and manufacture of many of the most important tools to pro- duce and maintain health (for ex- ample, the poliomyelitis vaccine) re- quire such settings. Physical privacy is much more dif- ficult to obtain as population den- sities increase, when it tends to be- come the prerogative of the wealthy, continued Cook, but adaptable hu- manity develops social psychological techniques for retaining the sense of privacy even under physically diffi- cult conditions. A freedom that becomes intoler- able in large agglomerations of peo- ple, Cook said, is the freedom to act out one's aggressive feelings vio- lently. The demand for "law and order" comes most often from urban- suburban people. We do not know, said Cook, at what point restraints on the freedom to reproduce-noted in all other species of animals studied under con- ditions where sufficient food is avail- able and control of predators and disease obtains-will develop for human populations. Historians a century from no,w may be able to point out that current research in the field of contraception is man's reaction to this biological built-in control. Social restraints are the inevitable consequence of "herd" living, Cook maintained. To find the optimum levels of population density, the size of area in which such densities are desirable, and the architectural and physical environment that is best su,ited to such densities is an urgent necessity if we are to blend the besit freedoms of the past with the new freedoms possible only in the future. Cook listed the population density (persons per 'square mile) in the following urban areas: City Density Cook County (Chicago)____ 5, 377 Washington, D.C----------- 12, 442 Suffolk County (Boston) --- 14,131 Philadelphia -------------- 15, 768 San Francisco ------------- 16, 451 New York: Bronx ------------------ 34, 751 Brooklyn -------------- 37, 533 Manhattan -------------- 73, 836 Bombay ----------------- 22, 323 Calcutta ------------------ 86, 073 Health Services for the Poor Coordinated Efforts Needed To Break Poverty Cycle There is no "poverty problem" in the singular, but rather a constel- lation of problems, stated Mayor Jerome P. Cavanagh of Detroit. Health problems have to be treated in their social context, he empha- sized. Medicine cannot be practiced in a sociological vacuum-to treat the disease but not the human patient. A mother receiving aid for de- 192 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="5">pelndenit children might have to overcome her fear or reluctance to seek hlelp, her transportation prob- lem, and her babysitting problem be- fore she can take her ill child to the physician. Moreover, she can look forward to hours of waiting in a dingy, overcrowded, reception room at a public hospital or clinic and to impersonal and even degrading treatment by overworked clerks, nurses, and physicians. Difficulties in Employment Job training and employment programs administered by the May- or's Committee for Human Re- sources Development have discov- ered that many young applicants lhave defects which hinder their training potential or their chances for employment. In the Neighbor- hood Youth Corps, for example, sig- nificant defects were found in about 20 percent of the 16- to 21-year-olds. In the manpower programs, the fig- ure was approximately 40 percent. Although not all of the defects are job disabling, about 10 percent of those examined would be rejected on employment physicals. Cavanagh stated that the most common defect was dental decay. The most frequent cause of rejec- tion was hypertension, followed by difficulties with visiion, and back complaints. At least one-third of that 10 percent of those rejected could be made medically fit at com- paratively little cost. Job openings vary from day to day. Few employers could commit themselves to hire a medically re- jected applicant at some indetermi- nate time in the future. In the month it might take to stabilize a diabetic, the company might be lay- ing off rather than hiring. Unless the rejected applicant is provided the treatment he needs, Cavanagh stated, he will remain permanently unemployable, and his experience with the poverty pro- gram will be an exercise in disillusionment. Communications Gap Better ways of disseminating in- formation about available services to the potential recipients must be discovered. Cavanagh stated that the Detroit health department had operated a maternity and infant care project since 1964, financed by a grant from the Federal Children's Bureau. Its goal is to provide com- prehensive maternity and infant care services for high-risk medically indigent families. The project has served about 3,000 patients in the past 4 years; but only one-half the eligible moth- ers were taking advantage of it. They did not know that these serv- ices were available. Health aides and paraprofes- sionals have been employed in target areas to bridge the gap between the middle-class language, values, and habits of the professional worker and the culture of the poor, Cav- anagh said. The people themselves are encouraged to share in policy making by having the poor elect their own representatives to the gov- erning board of a service agency. The philosophy is to develop re- sponsibility rather than allowing the people to continue to play the traditional role of humble, passive receivers of largesse. The process of citizen participa- tion gives officials a sensitive chan- nel for feedback as well as a source of fresh, unconventional ideas. An incidental but important byproduct of citizen participation has been the cadre of genuine grassroots leaders, able and articulate, who have emerged from the previously apa- thetic. This idea, which originated in the poverty program, is now working with similar results in the Model Cities Program. In Detroit, Cavanagh explained, the area where the poor live con- tains no suitable facilities for mod- ern health centers. Instead of planning new buildings for the re- mote future or establishing clinics farther out where the desirable buildings could be found, the policy makers, including the citizen repre- sentatives, decided to make do with the best available structures in the inner city. There is a desperate need for out- patient facilities, he declared. For persons to have to go to the emer- gency ward of a hospital to secure services which should be available outside of hospitals is tragically wasteful. Although children are provided preventive care in the pub- lic schoo,ls-vaccinations, chest X- rays-they do not get medical treatment there, although there may be no other place to go. Cavanagh emphasized that the vicious cycle of poverty cannot be broken by spending more money for schools, improving housing, ending racial discrimination, or supplying better services-all these things and more must be done simultaneously. Services for Poor in Cities Far From "Model" The urban community is in such jeopardy that mere housekeeping or firs,t aid is not enough, stated Chris A. Hansen, Assistant Surgeon Gen- eral and Commissioner, Environ- mental Control Administration, Pub- lic Health Service. Hansen called the Model Cities Program a chance to set up a pilot plant in a limited area but on a comprehensive basis to learn how, to get tooled up for a concerted attack on health problems. He declared that single-purpose planning is not enough. Rats, malnutrition, air pollution, radiation, automobile acci- dents-these are symptoms of a larger evil. The educators, the wel- fare people, the OEO, the civil rights agency, local government, and pri- vate agencies should all participate. When different agencies and differ- ent area jurisdictions work at cross-purposes, it's like treating a case of measles by trying to paint mercurochrome on every pimple. Traditionally the health mission has been relatively self-contained, concerned with order and sanitation, safety of air and water, protection against hazards arising from injury, threats of communicable disease, and disposal of wastes, he stated. He declared that health depart- ments have been the master house- keepers of the community. Disease prevention may now be- gin, not with a person sick with a communicable disease, but with public policy about land, housing, industrial development, transporta- tion, and comprehensive provision of patient services. Today, he empha- sized, we are challenged to become, Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 193</page><page sequence="6">jointly with other professions, en- vironmental designers, counselors, and advisers to architects, man- agers, and policy makers. Borrowing a concept from medical care, Hansen proposed an environ- mental resources delivery system. He offered four principles that might describe such a system. The principles, suggested by Leonard C. Staisey, chairman of county com- missioners, Allegheny County, Pa., were (a) people must participate, (b) people want to see things hap- pen quiekly, (e) the health depart- ment is the key to prompt action, and (d) the demonstration model is a pilot plant for good government. The Model Cities Program is an open invitation to experiment, to learn, to formulate pilot projects, and to design and test new ways to meet the challenge of the cities, Han- sen declared. The health department, if it accepts this invitation, must improve its performance internally and develop influential relationships with other agencies. The goal is a tested working model. New Role of Social Workers Lies in Community Medicine The development of community medicine can be seen as a slow, but sure, response to the significant and rapid social changes of our times, said Neil F. Bracht, School of Social Work, Michigan State University. Social Workers as Teachers New opportunities for social work teaching in the social, behavioral, and community aspects of health care in medical school programs and demonstrations have increased. Some 20 medical schools now have depart- ments of community medicine, sev- eral medical schools are active in community health development and demonstrations, and 10 schools spon- sor neighborhood OEO centers, Bracht stated. One example Bracht described is the participation of the public health social worker in the de- partment of community meidicine at the University of Kentucky Medical School, where the medical students live and work in communities for an extended period of time. All the faculty, including the faculty social worker, travel to the student to provide him-i with consul- tation and help, not only on clinical problems, but also on community health surveys and family projects as well, Bracht said. The student finds social work teaching more relevant as he experi- ences the itotal ecology of health in an Appalachian community or in an urban ghetto in Louisville. The appointments of social work- ers to administrative posts in medi- cal schools is another way in which they contribute to commiunity medi- cine. This participation by social workers as faculty members not only at Michigan State University, where a social worker serves as the as- sistant dean for extramural and conmmunity programs, but also in several other schools, such as Mt. Sinai, where a social worker serves in a major curriculuimi development capacity, is an important develop- ment. Bracht cited the contributions made to research by studies written by social workers on health care de- livery and behavioral aspects of pa- tient care which have resulted in better understanding of these fields. Participation by social workers in health and patient care studies, al- though not new, does provide rich opportunities to influence current thinking in optimal patterns of health care. Demonstration Projects The functions of social workers within the OEO neighborhood health demonstration centers are to edu- cate, to act as consultants, and to train indigenous personnel, Bracht stated. Aides have demonstrated "know how" in getting things done that professionals often find difficult to accomplish. Bracht believes, how- ever, that persistent problems such as nonprofessionalism and inability to carry through on the kinds of as- signments given have made some social workers cautious of all-out support for these efforts. He believes that there is need for greater study of appropriate roles and job speci- ficity for these aides. Another major practice activity for social workers in OEO projects is in the area of prevention. Bracht stated that knowledge and ability to apply public health and preven- tive models to social work practice are increasingly being called for within these settings. Social workers have been dele- gated more administrative respon- sibility in organizing and planning health services at OEO centers. Again, Bracht pointed out, impli- cations for specialized or advanced training of social workers in the skills and knowledge of medical care organization, administration, and delivery systems for health care are evident. The neighborhood health center offers many unusual opportunities for integration of social work skills in casework, group work, and com- munity organizations. Only recently, however, have schools begun train- ing students in multipurpose meth- ods and, as Federal programs turn more and more to the participation of the consumer in health care plan- ning, the social worker could be a most effective agent in assisting the lay person or consumer to becomie more knowledgeable about health and welfare issues, according to Bracht. Bicephalic Management Hurts NYC's Medicaid Two agencies with different philos- ophies and priorities cannot jointly run a program, declared Raymond Alexander, assistant commissioner, New York City Department of Health, commenting on the tangles experienced in the city's Medicaid program. Organizational Problems Before Medicaid, the city's welfare department, through the bureau of medical care, ran a medical program for recipients of public assistance. he said. The, welfare department did not create a new entity to cope with Medicaid but merely added to exist- ing staffs and expanded traditional functions, Alexander said. Conse- quently, health objectivesi were con- sistently blunted by differences in the philosophy of the health depart- ment and the newly named welfare department of social services. The recent reorganization of the 194 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="7">city's health services into the health services administration placed Medi- caid by executive order organization- ally in the health department. The department absorbed the old bureau of medical care, thereby coordi- nating all standard setting and evaluation personnel under health department control. Top-level health professionals were hired to assume direct operational responsibility, Alexander stated. All personnel and functions of the bureau were central- ized for ease of supervision and com- munication. At present, the bureau of health care services is responsible for all standard setting and evalua- tion activities of Medicaid. The staff consists! of 45 health department em- ployees and 291 department of social service employees. Although persons in the health de- partment as well as consultants sug- gested setting up a single unit out- side of both health and welfare to run Medicaid, the recommendation was not accepted. Alexander stated that this unit would have been simi- lar to the organiza.tion of an insur- ance company, with a subscriber section to handle enrollment, a claims processing section to handle payment, and a provider relations section to) handle standards and evaluation. A systems and statistical group would serve on a staff level to work on problems across the board. Staff in the welfare department contend that Medicaid could not be separated from other welfare activi- ties. Therein lies a basic conceptual disagreement that will need to be resolved by the Department of Health, Educatiion, and Welfare aind from the experience of other States in structuring their Medicaid pro- grams, Alexander declared. The social services department, al- though sitill part of the welfare de- partment, has difficulty coping with the demands of a welfare system in crises;, and Medicaid is not given the attention it deservels, Alexander stated.. The Computer-A Vital Link The Medicaid computer is con- trolled by the staff in social services. Indeed, Alexander said, social serv- ices justified its need for a computer upon the projected impact of Med- icaid. Medicaid, however, has re- ceived low priority in scheduling computer time. The computer has not resolved Medicaid problems but has created additional ones. Provid- ers complain about unreadable state- ments, mistakes in payment, kick- outs, and other computer-related sit- uations. Health department staff are still greeted at medical society meet- ings with the question, "Why cani't Medicaid be like Medicare and pay on time?" The inability of the health depart- ment to obtain meaningful data on utilization of services is an example of a basic need not met. Claim forms were primarily designed to give fiscal information rather than health information. Although there is information on the claims tapies which would give, data on how many patients used how many serv- ices, the health department has yet to receive this information. The com- puter, just as the executive, has a limited amount of time and energy available-unfortunately needs other than Medicaid's, as determined by the department of social services, are more pressing. Administrative Goals The administration of Medicaid could be improved by following these suggestions, Alexander said. 1. The principles of management and organization should be recog- nized as being as appropriate to health care as they are to industry. 2. Health departments ought to pay providers of service. With pay- ment comes identification, with iden- tification comes control, and with control comes program direction. 3. Health departments must set up bureaus or offices of medical care ad- ministration specifically to handle such areas as standard setting and evaluation of public programs and broad medical care programs. New persions with new talents need to be recruited for these jobis. The rapid entry of health departments into medical care programs dictates the need for ithis. 4. Health departments should con- trol data processing-both input and output. 5. Medicaid should be separated from traditional welfare activities. 6. Probably the, best administra- tive model for an effeicitive organiza- tion of Medicaid can be found in the insurance industry. Alexander believes that it is not too, late for public heialth profession- als to act; it is clear that Medicaid will be modified by legislation in the near future. Use Tactics of Realpolitik In Setting Standards An innovation in administering Medicaid was assigning to the health deplartment the tasks of standard setting, surveillance, and enforce- ment of quality in every aspect and place of publicly funded, personal health care, stated Dr. Lowell E. Bel- lin, Medical Assistance Program, New York City. Two committees have been orga- nized to, set fiscal and quality stand- ards for Medicaid reimbursable services, Bellin said. A negotiating committee handles questions of re- imbursement, and a quality commit- tee sets standards. The Medicaid Ad- visory Committee on Quality Care helps the Medicaid administration promulgate health care standards in four categories: (a) ingredients of service, (b) time per service, (e) administration, and (d) qualifica- tions of professionals. The sitandards incorporate the recommendations of prominent practicing and academic professionalsi in the community, and the staff of the health department writes these standards in bulletins which become work manuals for all providers of health care reimbursed bly Medicaid. Hearing Aids, A Case History Bellin cited the following case his- tory as the way administrators some- time modify standards, set by pro- fessionals to serve patients better. Originally New York City Medi- caid adopted the standards of the Handicapped Children's Program in dispensing hearing aids, to Medicaid enrollees, according to Bellin. A pa- tient with a hearing problem that might be responsive to a hearing aid was obliged to receive (a) first a medical evalulation from a board- qualified or certified otolaryngolo- Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 195</page><page sequence="8">gist, (b) then consultation with an audiologist and possibly a clinical psychologist and other personnel at an approved speech and hearing cen- ter, and (c) then the fitting of a hearing aid by an approved dealer. Thereafter, the patient revisits the speech and hearing center and the otolaryngologist to verify that the hearing aid was as prescribed and therapeutically satisfactory. As Medicaid enrollment grew, the number of speech land hearing cen- ters in New York City became inade- quate. The backlog was particularly bad in the Bronx, a high-poverty area, where the borough's sole speech and hearing center had a waiting period of at least 14 months, he asserted. The absence of an approved speech and hearing center in the Borough of Richmond compelled residents to travel to Manhattan and to other boroughs. To overcome the hardships for pa- tients the following decision on standards was made: patients age 21 and under would still be required to follow the old route from oto- laryngologist to speech and hearing center to hearing aid dealer; pa- tients above age 21 would proceed either to a speech and hearing cen- ter or directly to a hearing aid dealer at the discretion of the otolaryngolo- gist, whose professional decision would be supported by the health de- partment, Bellin declared. The impact of this decision was predictable. The number of hearing aids sold in New York City increased almost immediately, although the average cost per hearing aid did not change appreciably, Bellin said. Ac- cusations of expediency rather than appropriate concern for health care standards are still being made and will probably persist until sufficient speech and hearing centers are es- tablished so that the old rules may safely be reconstituted. Setting Standards Our experience verified the follow- ing generalizations on setting stand- ards, Bellin stated. 1. Medicaid can refuse payment if standards are not met. 2. Professionals and institutions will accept the health department as the ultimate decision-making au- thority if they are allowed to par- ticipate in the deliberations. 3. The health department identi- fies and coordinates, within the health care world, the diverse and often isolated forces who favor es- tablishing and elevating health care quality. To be effective, the health department must skillfully tap the conflicts smouldering within this world. 4. Participants in standard setting should not be categorized as "good" or "bad" but should be considered as persons and institutions with differ- ing perceptions of wherein les their self-interest. 5. It is the routine article of faith of each participating professional or institutional provider of care that the provider's legitimate self-in- terest is necessarily identical to the best interests of the recipients of health services. 6. Pragmatism and perceived self- interest generally prevail over ab- stract ideology in determining how profesisionals react to any proposed standards. Each category of profes- sionals zealously reslists what is deemed to be unwarranted eineroach- ment by functionally Conltiguous groups and will favor or oppose specific standards accordingly. 7. Adversaries may use whatever levers of power are available to them to frusitrate their opponents in setting inimical standards. 8. To set standards the adminis- trator must comprehend all the hid- den agendas inside and outside the department. 9. Standard setting in health care must always be a compromise of set- tling for the immediately achievable rather than resolutely holding out for the theoretical ideal. High Volume Practitioners Serve Medicaid Patients In New York City, onsite inspec- tions are now made to assess the quality of publicly funded care, stated Dr. Florence Kavaler, of the city's Medical Assistance Program. Peer auditors visited 126 general medical practitioners and 326 den- tists. Despite previously expressed fears of violation of physician-pa- tient relationships, the auditors were treated with courtesy and respect by the physicians and dentists, she declared. Auditor's visits are indispensable Qot only to gather information on the quality of care rendered, but also to identify and solve specific problems of professionals working with Medic- aid recipients. Some specific details given by Kavaler on the 126 physi- cians in general practice, most of whom are located in the Negro anid Puerto Rican section's of the city, were as follows: * 18 of these practices were in Manhattan, 26 in the Bronx, 66 in Brooklyn, and two in Queens. * These physicians represented 5 percent of all Medicaid medical prac- titioners and were paid $2.7 inillion, or 25 percent of the city's payments to private physicians in a 10-month period. * 9 percent were board eligible in a specialty such as internal medi- cine, pediatrics, or psychiatry. * 90 percent practiced alone. * 25 percent had no clerical or paraprofessional assistants. * More than half of the offices were established at least 20 years ago; only 5 percent were established dur- ing the past 5 years. * 30 percent of the physicians' practice were almost exclusively devoted to Medicaid patients. * 40 percent provided services for more than 60 hours per week. * 60 percent had some facilities for X-ray and fluoroscopy and small lab- oratories capable of performing rou- tine tests. * 20 percent made house calls de- spite personal physical dangers. * 30 percent were members of the American Academy of General Prac- tice, and almost all belonged to their local medical society. * 42 percent were affiliated with proprietary hospitals and have ad- mission privileges. * 35 percent had no access whatsio- ever to hospital beds. There were adequate waiting rooms and frequently more than one examining room, Kavaler said. Rec- ordkeeping is unsatisfactory, even for the routine recording of t-he chief complaint, physical findinjgs, and therapy. Onsite visits suggest that the phy- 196 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="9">sicians are not discriminating pro- fessionally against Medicaid pa- tients, she asserted. Episodic care is predominant, however, and the patient's symptoms receive primary attention. Little consideration is paid to screening procedures and preventive medicine. Physicians have difficulty in find- ing consultant specialists to accept their Medicaid patients and in find- ing hospitals and nursing homes, to admit them. In this respect there is discrimination, but the dis,crimina- tion is not the fault of the original general practitioner, Kavaler stated. Although the Medicaid administra- tion ultimately can suspend the poor- est and most recalcitrant practi- tioners from the program, she emphasized, the only realistic way to deliver high-quality care to the medically indigent patient through the ghetto practitioner is to reedu- cate the practitioner and restructure the health care complex to give him the necessary professional and insti- tutional support. Dentists The following data, Kavaler re- ported, were gathered by auditoris visiting the offices of 109 dentists where 326 dentists serve Medicaid patients. * 21 offices were in Manhattan, 41 in the Bronx, 45 in Brooklyn, and two in Queens. * The dentists represented 5 per- cent of all Medicaid dental practi- tioners and were paid $13.8 million, or 38 percent of the city's payments to private dentists in thie 10-month period. * 34 percent or $4.7 million of the Medicaid money was paid to these large offices. o 20 percent of the offices have four or more operatories and employ 50 percent of the full-time practitioners. * Moire than 30 percent of the offiees had been established within the past 5 years. * 80 percent of the primary den- tists (the dentist who established the practice and employs other dentists) have been in practice more than 20 years. * 35 percent of the primary den- tists have participated in continuing education since licensure; many of the younger dentists in general prac- tice have had postgraduate training. * The majo,r proportion of patients in more than 70 percent of group dental offices were Medicaid en- rollees. * 45 percent of the offices operate more than 50 hours per week; most had evening and Saturday hours. * 75 percent of the offices were staffed by one or two full-time den- tists. Larger offlces generally had a staff of professionals which equaled four to eight full-time dentists. A few had 12 full-time dentists. * 75 percent had translators to aid Spanish-speaking patients. * 97 percent of the offices had high-speed dental operatories and had enough units to accommodate their professionals. * 8 percent used the panographic X-ray device. * Most generalists referred sur- gery and prosthodontic cases to specialists when necessary. Kavaler stated that most offices were located in the marginal and depressed areas of the city, and there seems to be a trend toward store-front locations in the newer practices. The paraprofessional staff varies from one to two persons in small offices to 10 or more persons in larger practices. The staffs per- form multipurpose activities associ- ated with dental assisting, including clericial and chairside responisibili- ties. Some offices have as many as 10 to 16 functional units, exhibiting amazing efficiency and productivity. More Needy Receive Care Under MAP in Baltimore During the last year of the old Baltimore City Medical Care Pro- gram, an average of 9 percent of the population of the city was eligible to participate in the program. The following year, under the Medical Assistance Program (MAP), the average eligible population expanded to 16 percent through the inclusion of medically indigent persons under 65 years, said Marian E. Gornick and co-workers, Baltimore City Health Department. MAP, which functioned through the State under Medicaid provisions, continued the samiie fee- for-service system for physician's services used by the old medical care system. Eligible persons are free to choose any provider willing to accept them under the new program. Survey Made A household survey was made 9 months after MAP was instituted to measure the extent of enrollment in economically deprived areas of the city, to assess population character- istics, to measure pertinent factors relative to utilization of medical serviees, and to delineate emerging trends that differ from expected pat- terns, the authors said. A questionnaire was designed to obtain information about all mem- bers of a selected household relating to illness, physician or clinic visits, dental and eye care, family health needs, and participation in medical care, according to the authors. A report ranking the 168 census tracts of the city for nine indices was used to determine the survey area, the authors stated. The indices were the poverty rate, unemployment rate, age dependency rate, educational achievement rate, low-skilled occu- pation rate, property rental rate, financial dependency rate, adult crime rate, and juvenile delinquency rate. Ten census tracts, ranking in the highest quartile according to each of the indices, became the target area for the survey. The tracts con- tained an aggregate population of about 50,000 persons in 250 square blocks. The authors stated that 1,000 households were selected by a pro- cedure of cluster sampling of four households in each of the 250 blocks. Population Characteristics In the sample there were 4,379 persons, or an average of 4.4 persons, per household, compared with an average of 3.3 persons per household in the city, the authoirs reported. The families in 113 households were white, in 883 they were Negro, and four households were of other non- white races. Both husband and wife were living in 49 percent of the households where interviews were conducted. The authors pointed out that 52 Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 197</page><page sequence="10">percent of the households reported some or all members on MAP. The age dependency rate was 56 percent in the sample contrasted to a 45 percent rate for the city as a whole. Diata from the survey showed that only 41 percent of the visits made by MAP recipients for medical care were to private physicians while 59 percent of the visits were to clinics. These observations were the first in- dication of a shift in place of visit among needy persons in Baltimore, the authors said. This decline in pro- portion of private care to the total physician care rendered w,as con- firmed by program performance for the first year under MAP. The sur- vey dat.a and data collected from ac- tual program performance indicate, however, that there is a decline in the availability of private physi- cians' services for M.AP patients, es- pecially in the inner city areas. During the 2-week preinterview period, 11.4 percent of persons on MAP reported being ill. This per- centage of illness was significantly higher than the 8.7 percent of per- sons not on MAP. Thlat MAP re- cipients were ill more often than non- MAP patients was not unex- pected, the authors emphasized. MAP was intended to reach persions who needed medical assistance, such as welfare recipients, persons with incomes just above sub;sistence levels, and low-income persons who have had high medic.al expenses. In the non-MAP group, illness rates were highest in the oldest age group, 65 years and over, whereas in the MAP group illness rates were highest in the age group 45 to 64 years. The authors said that the re- sults were similar for utilization rates. For those not on MAP the old- est age group, 65 years and over, had the highest physician utilization rates; for persons on MAP the 45- to 64-year age group had the highest utilization rates. Data on illness and physician utili- zation by sex showed that women had a higher proportion of visits to a personal physician than did men for nearly all age categories. Women under 40 had a higher proportion of clinic visits also, although after age 40, men had la higher proportion of clinic visits than women. The authors emphasized that the intention of Public Law 89-97, title 19, is to give economically deprived persons medical care services in quantity and quality comparable to that private patients receive. The authors believe that in order to overcome the shortage of physi- cians, ways must be found to enlist the support *of more physicians in the area. Also, young physicians with special interests and skills in com- prehensive medical care, must 1be re- cruited and given incentives to prac- tice in understaffed areas with high concentrations of medical assistance patients. Medical Care Are Young People's; Ills Clues to Community Ills? A primary source of medical at- tention for adolescents is the local hospital emergency room. Service records in this 24-hour walk-in facil- ity provide provocative perspectives on the medical difficulties and social behavior of adolescients, bioth a,s in- dividuals and as a group. Thus, asked pediatrician Dr. S. Harvey Sklar of Cliffside Park, N.J., and Dr. Elinor F. Downs of the Columbia University School of Public Heialth and Administrative Medicine, might service records also be used to iden- tify new or unrecognized community situations which are hazardous to the health and safety of young people? To explore this possibility, a retro- spective record review was carried out in the emergency rooms of two community hospitals, one in Bergen County, N.J., and the other in New York City. Data extracted from the daily logs provided information on more than 2,700 suburban and 1,100 urban 13- to 20-year-old adolescents who sought emergency care during 1963. The authors poinited out that identical data-gathering techniques were used in both hospitals. The hospital-based observations were combined with pertinent com- muniity information fronm existing of- ficial and research sources, and sociomedical profiles of the two samples of adolescents were drawn and compared. The immediate ob- jectives were (a) to determine the major similarities and differences in the two samples in terms of emer- gency room use patterns, medical problems seen, and factors precipi- tating visits, (b) to relate the hos- pital-based observations to pertinent community information, and (c) to identify clues to specific local condi- tions which appeared to affect the health and safety of adolescents. Among patients of all ages who used the emergency services, the ado- lescents constituted 10 plercent in the urban unit and 16 percent in the sub- urban. These proportions were equal to or slightly greater than the representation of the same age groups (13-20 years) in their re- spective communities, the authors reported. The suburban youth tended to use emergency room services at least as often as, or possibly more than, their urban counterparts. The age spread of the adolescents treated was similar for the two hospitals; each year of age was almost equally represented. In both hospitals the majority of adolescents required prompt medical attention, but a delay of up to 24 hours would not have endangered them or caused unusual physical dis- tress or hardship. The seasoinal and diurnal patterns of emergency room visits were almost identical for the two groups. Parallels in urban and suburban experiences were also seen in the principal kinds of emergency serv- ices required. Heading the list of services required in both hospitals were surgical (lacerations, abra- sions, burns, concussion) and ortho- pedic (sprainis, parajoint injuries, fractures) ; together they accounted for more than 70 percent of the cases in the city facility and more than 80 percent in the suburban unit. The younger adolescents in both emer- gency units needed less surgical- orthopedic attention than those aged 17-20 years. As revealed by the records, the most important clues to community problems affecting young people 198 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="11">were (a) the ratio of traunmatic to nontraumatic cases treated and (b) the nature and course of events which lead to an emergency room visit. Most of the traumatic cases re- sulted from accideints caused by some external object or force. How- ever, the authors pointed out, a small but disturbing number of in- juries were associated with deliber- ate acts of violence perpetrated by others (assault) or by the patient (suicide attempt) and poisoning by drugs and other toxic substances without clear indication of intent to inflict harm. The percentage of ur- ban patients treated for injury by violence was nmore than twice that of the suburban group, and the 15- to 16-year-olds seemed to be particu- larly vulnerable. Boys in both groups were assaulted far more fre- quently than girls, but more girls att-empted suicide. Accidental injuries due to school athletics, motor vehicles, and job situations headed the list of identi- fied problems in the suburban com- munity, the authors reported. In the urban community, the basis of much of the illness and trauma in the iniddle-low income group seemed to reflect a breakdown in delivery of preventive and ongoing health serv- ices, a value system that accepts episodic care and a less than satis- factory socioenvironmental climate for teenage living. To truly serve a given population, a hospital must know its community. Periodic reviews of emergency room records might well provide helpful clues to unmet needs and their solu- tions, in the authors' opinion. To improve the usefulness of this moni- toring process, they recommended that at least a minimum of perti- nent, easy-to-obtain socioenviron- mental facts be included with the clinical data on all emergency room records. Simple coding and retrieval systems would facilitate recovery of desired information. Continuity of Care For Urban Infants From the data obtained in a study of infants' first year of medical expe- riences, Dr. Rowland L. Mindlin, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, and Dr. Paul M. Densen, Harvard Center for Community Health and Medical Care, Boston, concluded that continuity of medical care for infants does not exist for at least 40 percent of the white middle class, 75 percent of the minority group middle class, and 90 percent of the minority group lower class in New York City. Further, they con- tinued, elimination of the dichotomy between preventive and curative services, of itself, will not neces- sarily result in continuity for large numbers of infants. More mothers will want to have it and more physi- cians will have to be prepared to offer it actively before continuity of care can be provided for infants in large cities. For this study, an infant was considered to have received medical care with continuity if he had a single source of medical care during the year, or, if he had more than one, he received care from sub- sequent sources only by referral from other sources. Conversely, an infant who received care from sub- sequent sources withiout referral was considered not to have continuity of care. An infant who attended several hospitals or health stations was not considered "referred" because of the acknowledged lacks in communica- tion between these sources, the authors explained. Two samples of mothers of new- born infants in New York City were selected randomly from birth regis- trations during a stated period in each season of the year. One sample was drawn from a slum neighbor- hood and the other from a middle- class neighborhood. The mothers were interviewed in their homes, first when the infant was 1 month old and then monthly for 1 year. Structured questionnaires and 'trained lay inter- viewers, who were matched ethni- cally with the respondents, were used. A total of 242 completed cases were available for study from each district. The slum sample con- sisted of 11 white, 69 Negro, and 162 Spanish-speaking mothers. The mid- dle-class sample consisted of 192 white, 16 Negro, and 34 Spanish- speaking mothers. Of the 484 infants, 99 percent had seen a physician, but only 29 percent had continuity of care by the defini- tion used. The separation of preven- tive and curative services, where mothers had no alternative to seeing a different physician, accounted only for 23 to 30 percent of the reasons given by the Negro and Spanish plopulations without continuity and even less among the white popula- tion without continuity. A small per- centage could have used the same source for well care as for sick care but preferred a different source for well care, according to the authors. Turning to continuity of care from the mothers' point of view, the au- thors reported that at the end of the year's interviews the mothers wvere asked if they had a "doctor or place that you think of as your regu- lar doctor for the baby." A hospital clinic or a child health station was named by 172 mothers as a "regular doctor." These mothers were then asked if they would rather see a private physician or go to the clinic if cost were not a factor. Half of them said they would prefer a pri- vate physician. Asked why, only 17 mothers said "to see the same doctor each time." On the other hand, when the same 172 women were asked directly how important it was that their babies see the samiie doctor each time, 134, or 78 percent, said that it was important. These findinigs in- dicate that continuity of care is not salient in the minds of most mothers who clonsider their babies to be regu- lar patients of clinics, the authors statefd. New Directions Seen In Home Health Care In a discussion of past, present, and future activities of home care in the United States, Dr. Claire F. Ryder and co-authors from the Public Health Service's Division of Health Resources pointed out that pro- grams of home health services are moving in two directions-improved services for specific disease entities already on the caseload and devel- opment of services for new groups of patients not generally accepted for care at present. They presented several examples of these directions. Parkland Memorial Hospital in Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 199</page><page sequence="12">Dallas has a program for the man- agement of rheumatoid arthritis in the hospital and at home which has clearly indicated a need to modify conventional techniques of care within the home, the authors re- ported. Because of the remittent na- ture and profound psychological ef- fect of rheumatoid arthritis, the Parkland program supplements tra- ditional methods of care in the home with patient *and family education and counseling to provide both phys- ical and psychological support. The terminal cancer patient is generally not readily accepted in home care programs. The use of home care in terminal illness calls for appraisal and reappraisal of the patient, his family, and his home to determine whether such care is suit- able and for how long, according to the authors. In one community, program evalu- ation revealed that not one patient with terminal cancer had received home care, although many cancer patients had remained in hospitals until death. In the following year a concerted effort by hospital and home care sitaffs resulted in home care for selected patients with ter- minal cancer. The patient and family response was encouraging. The pa- tients were more at ease and re- quired fewer sedatives and drugs for pain, and their families were bet- ter able to cope with grief, the authors stated. The restricted number of patients who can receive intermittent renal dialysis in hospitals suggests the need for dialysis at home. Blue Cross of Michigan is exploring potential coverage of such care for its mem- bers. A 1-year project will pay for members' outpatient and home dialy- sis under the direction of six Michi- gan hospitals. Prepartum or post partum home care programs are not general in the United States, according to the au- thors. However, Boston City Hospi- tal recently provided a combined program of home care and outpatient care for pregnant cardiac patients. A public health nurse provided home services for these women sol that their total prenatal care was en- hanced, and the problems of travel- ing to !the outpatient department or being rehospitalized because of the cardiac condition were minimized. Recognition of the need to provide comprehensive medical care for the social as well as the medical prob- lems of maternity patients in low- income minority groups led to a home care program at the Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx in 1965. Among the benefits of the program was that 95 percent of the mothers returned to the hospital for post- partum care, in contrast to 50 per- cent of the general post partum caseload. Other population groups being reached by home care programs are premature infants, alcoholics, and outpatients with heart disease. Fur- ther, in Michigan's Saginaw Hospi- tal home care is combined with day care. Bedbound patients are brought to the hospital's rehabilitation de- partment where they receive social, rehabilitative, and dental services during the day. They also receive skilled nursing and home health aide services in their homes. The authors suggested that the role of home care in mental health programs be explored. Although some mental health programs, with the help of public health nurses from community agencies, have estab- lished services for individuals dis- charged from mental institutions who need followup care, the authors believe that there is further need for home health agencies and mental health centers to identify common needs and common goals for their respective patients. An exchange of personnel between these two agen- cies might improve the care of pa- tients both serve. Further, they continued, there is need for programs in which intensive care of the men- tally ill can be provided at home by visiting psychiatrists, psychiat- ric social workers, or psychiatric nurses. Medicare's Impact Varies With Group Health Plans After reviewing the experiences of group practice prepayment plans since Medicare was started, Dr. Harold F. Newman, director of the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, concluded that generally these plans have lost few subscribers because of the Federal program. In fact, he added, some have been able to capitalize on a more sound fiscal situation to expand their enrollment of the elderly. Before Medicare, the aged were considered to be a high-risk group with limited financial resources, and thus few plans could offer people over age 65 enrollment on an indi- vidual basis. Under Medicare, the risk in cost of underwriting was substantially modified, and many plans were enabled to underwrite the marginal cost of deductibles and co-insurance, plus services not cov- ered by Medicare, for a modest added premium, Newman reported. About 71/2 percent of the Puget Sound's 110,000 members are Medi- care beneficiaries. This plan has not attempted to enroll additional MIedi- care subscribers, Newman said. In this consumer-owned, nonprofit group practice prepayment plan, all members are entitled to lifetime coverage. The percentage of the plan's population over age 65 has remained relatively constant; few of the elderly have terminated their coverage because of Medicare. Although medical and hospital costs in general have risen sharply since Medicare, because of increased use and higher wage costs, ,the prin- cipal effect on group practice pre- payment plans has been the necessity to provide much higher salaries for physicians and para- medical personnel in order to keep present staff and attract new staff. Newman stated. Before Medicare, the Puget Sound members who were over age 65 saw a physician about 1.6 times as much as the average isubiscriber. This fig- ure has not changed significantly under Medicare. However, Newman pointed out, both the average mem- ber and the person over 65 are seeing a physician more often than they did several years ago. Despite the in- creased number of physician visits, the percentage of total physician use by people over 65 compared with people under 65 has remained con- stant in the Puget Sound plan, Newman reported. Interestingly, use of hospital beds for acute illnesses by Puget Sound 200 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="13">meinbers over age 65 has decreased. Before Medicare, such members were using 30 percent of the plan's total hospital beds or about 2,000 hospital days per 1,000 persons cov- ered. During the first 6 monthis of Medicare, the figure dropped to 28 percent of the total beds, or 1,900 days per 1,000 persons. At present, people over age 65 are using between 24 and 25 percent of the hospital beds, or roughly 1,800 days per 1,000 persons. Newman attributed the re- duction in use of hospital beds to the extended care benefit under Medi- care. This type of benefit was not previously available to the plan's over 65 population. The Puget Sound plan is one of many plans which deal directly with the Social Security Administration for reimbursement, rather than through a fiscal intermediary. In Newman's opinion, the present methods of reimbursement from So- cial Security are extremely cumber- some. Group practice prepayment plans which normally received level capitation payments to meet their costs are now forced to bill on a per diem basis for hospital care, and they are also subject to retroactive adjustment for interim capitation payments under part B of the Medi- care program. Although Newman is not aware of any plans whieh have been denied adequate payments to meet their costs, he said thiat the cumbersome fiscal procedures result in higher ad- ministrative operating costs and they provide no incentive to the plans to give service in the moist efficient and economical way possi- ble. He believes that all plans could show cost savings if they were per- mitted to offer services based on a single capitation payment for both part A (hospital insurance benefits) and part B (supplementary medical insurance benefits). This method of payment, he added, would be the same ias the arrangement which the Government has for employees under the Federal Employees Health Bene- fits Program. Newman believes that Medicare will stimulate creation of more group practice prepayment plans, particu- larly hospital-based plans. He con- cluded that establishment of group practice in hospitals will permit them to offer broader and more compre- hensive health services to defined populations. Why do Patients Choose Certain Hospitals? Recent studies have revealed two sets of systematic relationships- one between the patterns of hospital use and the socioeconomic character- istics of patients and the other be- tween hospital use and hospital characteristicsi. Partly as an attempt to explain these relationship.s and partly as a separate theoretical de- velopment, two distinct theories of economics of consumption of hospital services have emerged, said Dr. Kong-kyun Ro of the National Bureau of Economic Research, New York Clity. One theory postulates that ho,s- pital use is determined through the inte,raction between patients and physicians. A physician is, described as treating a person, not a disease. Accordingly, personal and situational factors, in addition to medical con- ditions, are taken into consideration by physicians. The other theory pro- poses that thei economics of con- sumption has no role in explaining hospital use. Production of hospital services is envisioned as largely determined by technological impera- tives and productive facilities avail- able and institutional characteristics of individual hospitals. What is required is an integration of the two theories, said Rbo. For this purposie, he proposed a new model in which consumption of hospital services is hypothesized as a com- posite effect of the joint interaction among physicians, patients, and hospital. The population studied consisted of 22 hospitals in the Pittsburgh area and 9,000 patients admitteid to to these hospitals during 1963. The data weire collected by Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania. The principal methoid of analysis was the least-square single regression in vari- ous forms and its variants, suclh as the two-stage estimati'on procedure. The differences in patient and hos- pital characteristies combined ex- plain variations in hospital use better than variations in either pa- tient or hospital characteristics alone, according to Ro. However, he said, the improvement in the explain- ing power is unimpressive-much less than the sum of the two. T'his indicates that patients with certain socioeconomic backgrounds enter hospitals which have ceirtain insti- tutional characteristics. Ro pointed out that this observation was sup- ported by a statistical test which showed a significant association be- tween some of the patient character- istics and the hospital where the patient is treated. Basted on this; find- ing, interaction terms were formed between variables representing pa- tient characteristics and those rep- resenting hospital characteristics, and their influences on hospital use were examined. The results revealed that the overall explaining power of independent variables increases when interaction terms are formed and the nature of the impact of some of the vairiables on hospital use is clarified. Nursing Agency Audits Quality of its Care Health care is often provided with discrimination based on ethnicity, color, age, nature of the illness, or life style of the recipients. Nurses are not fully agreed on the importance and influence of nursing as a major component in health care systems. The principle of accountability is not easily accepted, as illustrated by resistance to accreditation and cer- tification of institutions and agen- cies. Some nurses say that quality of nursing care is an intangible and therefore not subject to measure- ment. After expressing these beliefs, Maria C. Phaneuf, Wayne State University College of Nursing, De- troit, stated that fortunately large numbers of nurses have become interested in appraising the quality of nursing care by use of the audit method, and she described such an audit undertaken by a large public health nursing agency. At a 2-day workshop in April 1968, a consultant presented the audit method to the agency's executive di- rector, supervisors, administrative staff, consultants, and certain staff Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 201</page><page sequence="14">members. The workshop was focused primarily on three major questions: What is the audit? What are the standards against which quality of care is judged? Who does the audit? The nursing audit is a method for systematic written appraisal of the process of nursing care, which is made after discharge of the patient through examination of the patient care records. The records are used because complex modern care cannot be given to complex human beings without use of the record as a service instrument-as a means to service, Phaneuf explained. The method was designed for use in hospitals, public health nursing agencies, and nursing homes. One dependent and six independ- ent functions of nursing are used as standards against which quality of care is judged: application and exe- cution of the physician's legal or- ders, observation of symptoms and reactions, supervision of the patient, supervision of those participating in care, reporting and recording, appli- cation of nursing procedures and techniques, and promotion of health by direction and teaching. The agency's audit was performed by a committee of 11 nurses ap- pointed by the executive director. The committee audited a total of 60 cases; 30 in which a cerebral vas- cular incident was the primary con- dition and 30 in which heart disease was the primary condition. Apart from the workshop time, the com- mittee work from orientation through auditing of the 30 cases required seven conferences which lasted 21/2 to 3 hours. Time required for the average case review by indi- vidual members was initially an hour or more; however, with experience it was reduced to 15 or 20 minutes- Results The overall findings for the 30 cerebral vascular incident cases were that one patient received ex- cellent care; six, good care; eight, incomplete care; 11, poor care; and four, unsafe care. In the 30 cases where heart disease was the primary condition, none of the patients received excellent care; three, good care; five, incomplete care; 16, poor care; and six, unsafe care. The analysis indicated that the best-executed function wvas the car- rying out of the physician's orders- the dependent nursing function. However, Phaneuf reported, weak- nesses were also found in the execu- tion of this function. The major ones were lack of evidence of understand- ing of the pathophysiological proc- esses and failure to take the patient's health history into account in asses- sing needs and planning nursing in- tervention. Observations of symp- toms and reactions were found to be fragmentary, partly as a result of these weaknesses. A major problem was that significant secondary dis- eases were ignored-nearly half of the patients had such diseases. Weaknesses evident in execution of the other nursing functions were judged to be related to two major points. Because the observations of symptoms and reactions were frag- mentary, other responsibilities and opportunities were not perceived, Phaneuf noted. Where care was judged to be good or excellent, it was obviously per- sonalized-clearly individualized ac- cording to the patient and his situation. On the whole, Phaneuf stated, care seemed to be inade- quately personalized. Recommendations The committee's recommendations for the agency included the following: * Use of the International Classi- fication of Diseases in obtaining and recording primary and secondary diagnoses. * Increasing emphasis on obtain- ing orders regarding all medications used by the patient, whether or not they were administered by the nurse. * Exploration of reasons why nurse-to-physician communications are incomplete and nursing judg- ments are seldom conveyed. * Increasing attention to assess- ment of vital signs, with recording and use of findings. * Establishment of the policy of requiring nursing assessment of the patient's physical and emotional condition- at the time of admission and at the time of discharge. * Development of stanidards for charting, using the nursing audit schedule as a process guide. Indices of Performance In Ambulatory Clinics In response to the need for reli- able comparative data oni the func- tioning of ambulatory clinics, an exploratory study was initiated to obtain information that could be used to experiment with the con- struction of indices of clinic per- formance. Wide variations on a number of indices were demon- strated, and some are directly rele- vant to assessment of adequacy of care and of amenities in providing care, according to Dr. Walter L. Johnson and Dr. Leonard S. Rosen- feld, Health and Hospital Planning Council of Southern New York, Inc. Data for the study were obtained in eight New York City hospitals from 1-day observations of patient visits at clinic sessions and from concurren,t surveys of the staffing patterns of observed clinic sessions. The types of data collected included time of patient's arrival at the clinic, patient's status (new or re- visit), time in and out of examina- tion rooms, and certain items regarding physicians and ancillary personnel in contact with the patient in the examination room. A combi- nation of the time information with the staffing and patient load data produced composite indices of per formance which revealed important variations between hospitals and clinic sessions' on significant param- eters, the authors reported. An outstanding example of the variations, the authors pointed out, is the range in waiting time in gen- eral medical clinics which varied between 24 and 124 minutes. An- other example is in the number of patients per available physician-hour in general medical clinics which ranged from 14.5 to 2.4. Such indi- cators can be useful to administra- tors in recommending changes in service programs. However, the authors believe the indicators can be even more useful when more com- 202 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="15">plex forms of analysis involving the interrelationships of several indices are used, iand they cited the follow- ing examples to illustrate their po- tential. Coordination of patient arrival with physician arrival. The study data revealed a definite and meas- urable difference between the formal beginning of clinic sessions and the beginning of physician sessions. In six of 10 general medical clinic ses- sions, the first physician began see- ing patients an 'hour or more after the patients 'arrived and were ad- mitted or registered. Moreover, the authors said, a complicating factor in coordination is the pattern of arrival and departure of individual physicians. In all instances, !the average time spent by individual physicians in clinic sessions was no- ticeably less than the length of 'time scheduled for the physician session. Thus, not only were the physician sessions in the sample measurably shorter than the formal sessions, but few physicians participated in direct patient care over the entire span of the physician session. New paitients and revisit patients. In most of the prenatal clinics ob- served, the first-visit patients re- ceived at least twice as much time as the revisit patients. In the general medical clinics, however, only one hospital had average times for new patients which were about twice those for revisit patients, and in two instances the new patients actually averaged less time with the physiciall than the revisit patients. From the implications of these con- trasting observations, the authors concluded tha't new patients often do not receive the attention from physicians that accepted standards indicate to be desirable. Performance by type of clinic. With respect to patient load and staff resources, the pediatric clinics in the sample showed a better bal- ance between both patient load and available physician-hours and pa- tient load and ancillary personnel th'an the other clinics. Also, the au- thors noted that a generally longer average time was spent by the phy- sicians with pediatric patients. By contrast, the prenatal clinics showed certain distinlctive feature-s which reflect in part their different standards and requirements, the au- thors stated. A larger number of pa- tients per available physician-hour is indicative of the lesser amount of physician time required for revisit prenatal patients than for general medical revisit patients. Waiting time in the prenatal clinics is com- paratively high-patients aro re- quested to come long before the physicians arrive, often as much as 90 or more minutes. However, the authors explained, in many prenatal clinics this time is not spent entirely in waiting. Pre- liminary work pertaining to collect- ing information, to piatient eduica- tion, or to obtaining laboratory speci- mens may be done before the pa- tients see the physicians. Some clinics use waiting time to coilduct maternity classes. No attempt was made to assess this factor in the study, but, the authors recom- mended, standards relating to wait- ing time should be flexible enough to take such requirements into account. There was far less variation in the ratio of ancillary staff to patients in the prenatal clinics than in the other clinics. The authors suggested that this may reflect a broader base of widely accepted standards in pre- natal care. Family Planning Two States Computerize Family Planning Data Maryland Because of the many administra- tive problems that arose in att.empts to evaluate Maryland's family plan- ning program, a new method of eval- uation was devised in 1967. The greatest need was to determine the number of patients actively partici- pating in the program in local health department clinics at any given time, according to Dr. Gary Richard Snyder, a Public Health Service Epidemic Intelligence Service officer in family planning evaluation, and co-authors from the Maryland State Department of Public Health. The number and rate of change of the number of active patients would be a gross index of how effective a local program is in recruiting new pa- tients, of whether patients continue to return for service, and of the effectiveness of the program's fol- lowup efforts, the authors pointed out. New definitions were created for active, delinquent, inactive, and ter- minated patients. Medical and statis- tical record forms previously used were discarded, and a precoded form was designed in two parts-one for initial visits and one for revisit rec- ords. The new form meets the need for computerized statistical as well as medical data. The authors noted that both types of information can be recorded far more rapidly than previously-an individual record for a new patient can be completed in about 7 minutes at present, as op- posed to 15 minutes with the old system. Another benefit, they said, is the readily available statistical information. The computer program is designed to maintain a continuously updated master file for each patient. Wheni the records from the clinics are re- ceived in the central offlice, they are checked for completeness. Each week all records received within the pre- ceding week are punched on IBM cards and verified; every item on the initial visit record is punched. For the revisit records, only the items in which a change has been noted are punched. The data are then checked for completeness and valid- ity in a card-to-tape editing process. The data are updated, and at this point an updated master file has been created on tape for each patient. The appropriate report tapes-new re- visit records to be printed and monthly, quarterly, and yearly re- ports-are generated from the master file. Currently, each clinic receives a monthly report consisting of (a) alphabetical lisitings and status codes, according to the new defini- Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 203</page><page sequence="16">tions, of all patients on its rolls (name, family planning number, ad- dress, telephone number, date of next appointment), as well as for all de- linquent, inactive, and terminated patients, (b) summary tables show- ing for the current month and year to date the number of new patients, carryover patients, revisit patients, how many patient visits these repre- sent, and how many patients are ac- tive, delinquent, inactive, or termi- nated as of the date of the report, (e) a return rate showing the per- centage of patients who were delin- quent, inaetive, or terminated and became active again, and (d) the average interval for patients to return. The authors reported that as of Septeinber 1, 1968, the cost of de- veloping and operating the computer- ized system was approximately $8,000, plus about 70 percent of the time of an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer. Georgia Development of a computerized data processing system, similar to that of Maryland's, has refocused at- tention on care of individuals in Georgia's statewide family planning program, reported Dr. Ronald W. O'Connor, a Public Health Service Epidemic Intelligence Service officer in family planning evaluation, and co-authors from various Georgia agencies. The availability of ac- curate, current data has accelerated evolution of service goals to the point that reliance on traditional program indices-visits, admissions, patients iserved-and attention to establishment of geographic cover- age have been superseded by concern for the continuity of effective family planning service provided for each individual, they added. Previous hand-tabulated counts of new patients served, with cumula- tive yearly carryover, produced a total of 41,707 patients contacted since 1966. However, the computer master file of all individual family planning records for the same period revealed that only 42 percent, or 17,708, of the patients were actually continuing to attend the clinics as of October 1968. This and several other observations made po;ssible by the accurate data provided by the com- puter system pointed up the fact that evaluation must now focus on the prevalence of patients who are continuing clinic-based contracep- tion and discard reliance on body counts and packages of pills dis- pensed, the authors stressed. Citing the effects of the system on the agencies concerned with the pro- gram, the authors said that it meets the following needs of local health clinics, which have limited budgets and personnel and a primary inter- est in patient care: (a) they can depend on regular, relevant reports about their own patients and re- ports concerning how their pro- grains measure up to local need as well as to other programs through- out the State, and (b) they have been relieved of all other reporting and statistical analysis, a major de- crease in paperwork that allows more time to serve the patients. Monthly tabulations of services pro- vided have been eliminated, appoint- ment scheduling is simplified, and searching of files for patients who need followup is done automatically. For State-level agencies, the data processing system provided current, concise information on the directions of the total program at a reasonable price, according to the authors. The total initial investment wvas $4,500- about 3 months of consultant time at $3,000 and programing expenses of $1,500. Monthly operation by the State health department data proc- essing and hiostatistics division, at a total cost of $600 for the present load of 3,000 records per month, in- cludes 1 hour of computer time, coding, key punching, and verifica- tion. This operation averages 5 cents per active patient per month. No estimate had been made of the time saved at every local clinic as a result of the elimination of clerical and statistical tabulations as well as random home visits. The authors concluded that the opportunity to take advantage of in- expensive patient-relevant informa- tion for evaluation and action fostered resolution of agency differ- ences and directed attention to their primary roles in the provision of quality family planning service as follows: * Local health departments to patient service. * Welfare to referral and educa- tion for a needy population. * Planned Parenthood to motiva- tion, enlightenment, and general prodding of both the public and pri- vate communities. * The State health department to provision of consultation, supplies, and evaluation through the data processing service. Risk of Thromboembolism From Use of the Pill The use of oral contraceptives seems to be associated with an increase in mortality from diseases of the veins, of which pulmonary embolism is the largest single com- ponent, but not from cerebral or coronary thrombosis, according to the results of a study of underlying cause mortality trends for these diseases in the United States by two epidemiologists at the National Insti- tutes of Health. UJsing published U.S. mortality data, Dr. Robert E. Markush, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness, and Dr. Daniel G. Seigel, National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop- ment, calculated slopes for mortality trends within three time periods, 1951-56, 1957-61, and 1962-66, for each 5-year age group between 15 and 65, for men and women, for white and nonwhite persons, and for each of the following three cate- gories of the seventh revision of the International Classificaition of Diseases: 332, cerebral embolism and thrombosis; 420, arteriosclerotic heart disease, including coronary disease; and 460-468, diseases of veins and other diseases of the cir- culatory system. They then divided each slope by the mean mortality rate for the given age, sex, color, diagnosis, and time pleriod to obtain an estimate of annual percent change in mortality. They calculated four different "expected" values for each of the estimated percent changes in mor- tality for women during 1962-66. The expected values were based on mor- tality rates for (a) men in the same time period, (b) women during 204 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="17">1957-61, the 5 years before oral con- traceptives were introduced, (c) an adjustment of b for changes between 1951-56 and 1957-61, and (d) an adjustment of b for changes in rates for men between 1957-61 and 1962- 66. These differences were analyzed to determine whether mortality for women in the reproductive ages has been increasing in recent years relative to what might have been expected. The results indicated that appreci- able relative increases have occurred in the death rates for cerebral embo- lismi and thrombosis for women in only four of the 20 five-year age groups examined. All but one of the increases are based on relatively small numbers of deaths. Although death rates for coronary disease show some relative increase for women in most 5-year age groups between 15 and 45, most of the increases are either small or also based on small numbers of deaths. Death rates for diseases of the veins and other diseases of the circu- latory system, on the other hand, have increased relatively for all age groups of women between 20 and 44. Apart from these ages, the only comparable increases are for the white women aged 50-54 years and for the nonwhite women aged 45-49 years. Markus h and Seigel pointed o,ut that these results are compatible, except for the negative findings for cerebral thrombosis, with three recent case-control studies in Eng- land which suggested that women who use oral contraceptives have an increased risk from superficial phle- bitis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein and possibly cerebral throm- bosis, but not from coronary heart disease. Furthermore, the conclu- sions for diseases of the veins agree with those of a similar study of mortality trends for venous throm- boembolism in England and Wales. Family Planning Program For American Indians The results of an evaluation of family planning activities in the comprehensive health care program of the Public Health Service for about 400,000 American Indian and Alaska Native beneficiaries were re- ported by Dr. Erwin S. Rabeau and Dr. Angel Reaud of the Division of Indian Health. Approximately 75,450 of the beneficiaries are women aged 15-44 years. The evaluation, covering fiscal years 19'65-68, included measure- ment of the program objectives, health objectives, and cost of the program. Program objectives were measured by acceptance of contra- ceptive services, continuation of use of contraceptives, and reduction in the number of births of Indian and Alaska Natives in Public Health Service Hospitals. For the appraisal of the impact of the program on the health of the beneficiaries, trends of abortions, prematurity, pediatric morbidity, and infant mortality wvere analyzed. Costs were estimated and expenditures for each woman who was provided service were cal- culated. Rabeau and Reaud summed up the major findings of the evaluation as follows. Of the 75,450 female beneficiaries aged 15-44 years, 21,447 or 28.5 per- cent received services for various periods of use of contraceptives since July 19,64. Since that time also, new acceptors of contraceptive iserv- ices averaged 5,370 per year. Among the women who were hospitalized for delivery or abortion, 39 percent accepted contraceptive services before or within 2 months after dis- charge from the 'hospital. Concerning dropout rates during the first year of use of contracep- tives, expulsion, removal, and unin- tended pregnancies were estimated for about 25 percent of the women who used intrauterine devices. How- ever, 42 percent of the women who used oral contraceptives discon- tinued use during the first year. A definite decrease was seen in the number of births after the pro- gram was started. Downward trends were observed in abortions, prema- turity, and piediatric morbidity. Dur- ing the years analyzed, family plan- ning was the only program started which was capable of affecting the trend of 'these indicators, the au- thors pointed ojut. Substantial reduc- tion in infant mortality ratesl had already occurred before the pro- gram; these rates stabilized after- ward with no decrease coincident with contraceptive activities. In fiscal year 1967, 12,506 women (new and previous acceptors) were given birth control services. With a total cost of $268,180, the cost per woman was $21. In fiscal year 1968, 11,236 acceptors were provided serv- ices at a total coist of $275,000 or $24 per woman. If the expenditures esti- mated lby the Division of Indian Health for public health nurses, health educators, and social workers were excluded from the total to per- mit comparison with other pro- grams, the cost per woman was $14 in 1967 and $15 in 1968. Measure Need-Use Rates For Family Planning Clinic A 1967 survey undertaken to de- termine the effectiveness of a family planning prograin for low-income women in Charlotte, N.C., disclosed that one-half to one-third of such women 15 to 44 years of age were in need of family planning services but that only 40 percent were re- ceiving these services at the time of the survey. Reporting selected data from the survey, Dr. Earl Siegel, department of maternal and child health, Uni- versity of North Carolina School of Public Health, Chapel Hill, and co- authors concluded that a continuous major effort is required for an iade- quate family planning service, es- pecially where in-migration and out- migration are sufficient to result in a high turnover rate in the target group. Interviews were conducted with women 15-44 years of age in a random sample of 7.5 percent of the households in the 23 lowest socio- economic census tracts in Charlotte. The population in actual need of services was obtained by subtract- ing from the financially eligible group all women classified as either permanently or temporarily not in need of family planning services. Of 800 women interviewed, 508 (442 nonwhite and 66 white) were determined to be financially eligible for clinic services. Of the 508, 52.9 percent were classified as currently in need of services-13.8 percent were Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 205</page><page sequence="18">already receiving services and 39.1 percent were not. The remaining 292 women were determined to be "not poor," as defined later, and thus they were financially ineligible. Among those not receiving serv- ices were 8.7 percent who were never married-never pregnant but sexually active, 9 percent who regularly used condoms or diaphragms, and 21.4 percent who were ever married, ever pregnant, or siexually active women who were not using contra- ceptives. Significantly fewer white women (40.9 percent) than nonwhite (54.7 percent) were classified as cur- rently in need (P=0.02). The differ- ence in need was explained by the high sterilization rate for white women. There was no evidence of difference related to race in the never married-never pregnant sexually ac- tive group or among those who were regularly using condoms or diaphragms. Almost a fifth (18.7 percent) of the financially eligible women were cliassified as permanently not in need of family planning services because of infertility or sterilization. A high- er proportion of white women (27.3 percent) than nonwhite women (17.4) were in this group. More than two-thirds of these women were sterile as a result of tubal ligation and about a fifth had had a hyster- ectomy. None of the partners of the total group of women had had a vasectomy. Slightly more than one-fourth (28.4 percent) of the women were classified as temporarily not in need of family planning services. Rela- tively small proportions were preg- nant (5.7 percent) or trying to be- come pregnant (1 percent). Only 7.5 percent were using oral contracep- tives or intrauterine devices which were prescribed at sources other than the public health clinic. Almost 15 percent of the women were sexually inactive, and 40 percent of these were never married-never pregnant girls under 18 years old. No significant differences were seen between the white and nonwhite women for each of the subcategories in this group. Siegel and co-authors pointed out that the inadequacy of a single method of defining a target popula- tion that would be appropriate for all purposes prompted them to present different criteria of need. This ap- proach, they added, directs attention to several special groups whose needs should be considered. Three such groups are (a) women living in low- income census tracts but with suffi- cient income to be classified as "not poor" and "financially ineligible," al- though most of them could be con- sidered "almost low income," (b) the never married-never pregnant sexu- ally active group, and (c) low-income women who rely on diaphragms or condoms for contraception. The proportion of unmet need for contraception was higher among the 292 "not poor" interviewees than among the 508 low-income respond- ents. This was true for all suggested ways of defining need, the authors stated. The fact that this difference disappears if those attending the clinic and those reporting tubal liga- tion ar: omitted suggests that the difference may be due to the avail- ability of services to low-income women that are not available to "not poor" women. As for the group classified as never married-never pregnant but sexu:ally active, about 30 percent of the women in the survey aged 20-29 years reported having had sexual intercourse before they were 16 years old and about 75 percent had their first such experience at 17 or younger. Based on these reports, the authors concluded that a substantial proportion of these girls over the age of 15 should be considered to be in need. Whether couples who regularly use diaphragms or condoms should be considered in need of family plan- ning services is less certain, since these methods are effective when used consistently. Nine percent of the survey's low-income couples reported use of these methods regularly dur- ing the month before interview. On the other hand, Siegel and co-authors stated, virtually all these couples used condoms and therefore wvere not receiving the health supervision pro- vided through a family plalnning pro- gram wvitli a medically prescribed method. Epidemiology Skin May Be Equal to URT In Pathogenesis of AGN Under certain conditions the skin may be equally if not more impor- tant than the upper respiratory tract (URT) as the source of the pre- ceding streptococcal infection in pa- tients with acute glomerulonephri- tis (AGN), observed Dr. Edward L. Kaplan and associates, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. They discussed cutaneous infec- tion in relation to the spread of group A streptococcus and the epi- demiology of acute nephritis. Since group A streptococci are often recovered from both the upper respiratory tract and skin lesions in patients with pyoderma at the onset of acute glomerulonephritis, the authors explained, the relative im- portance of these two sites of infec- tion in the epidemiology and patho- genesis of AGN has been difficult to assess. An opportunity to investigate this question was provided in 1966 at the Red Lake Indian Reservation by the reintroduction of a kniown nephritogenic strain (type 49) and the concomitant epidemic of acute nephritis on the reservation. The Study More than 100 childreni, 3 to 5 years old, in an Operation Head Start program were followed with weekly urinalyses and cultures of the nose, throat, and skin lesions. Colonies of beta-hemolytic strepto- cocci on blood agar plates were quan- titated and serologically grouped by Lancefield's method. Group A strains were typed by the precipitation method for M antigen and by the agglutination method for T antigen. Serums were obtained for streptococ- cal antibodies. The authors reported that the ini- tial visit to the Head Start program to obtain cultures was during the first week of July 1966. The cultures obtained during this visit yielded six 206 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="19">isolations of type 49 streptococci, the first documented isolation of this serotype at Red Lake in at least 10 years. The majority of the 25 cases of nephritis occurred during July and August when the skin and not the URT appeared to be the most fre- quent site of first acquisition of the epidemic strain, the authors said. During the summer and fall most acquisitions of type 49 streptococci in the upper respiratory tract were transient, and only small numbers of streptococci were isolated from the upper respiratory tract. During the winter, when skin infections were un- common, the URT appeared to be more important in the spread of the type 49 streptococcus. The data suggest that while type 49 streptococei rarely spreads from the upper respiratory tract to skin lesions, it not infrequently spreads from skin lesions to the URT. Colonization and infection of the URT with group A streptococci ap- pear to be less important than strep- tococcal skin infection in the epidem- iology and pathogenesis of acute nephritis under some conditions. Human Origin Globulin Potent Antirabies Serum The first supply of human origin rabies immune globulin (HRIG) that is as potent as equine origin antirabies serum (ARS) has been developed at the National Commu- nicable Disease Center, Public Health Service. Dr. R. Keith Sikes, chief of the Center's Rabies Research and Control Unit, reported 4 years of progress in the development, test- ing, and plans for use of HRIG. This HRIG contains 165 international units of rabies antibody per ml., ex- ceeding the minimum 100 interna- tional units per ml. now required of ARS. To determine the feasibility of developing human origin rabies im- mune globulin, Sikes explained, donors who had received post- or pre-exposure rabies immunization were given a booster injection of duck embryo rabies vaccine. Blood specimens were taken between 1 week and 1 month later. The globulin was fractionated by the Cohn ethanol fractionation tech- nique, he continued. Pyrogen, steril- ity, and potency tests were conducted as prescribed by the Division of Biological Standards, National Insti- tutes of Health, Public Health Service. Earlier tests of 3 lots of HRIG with a lower potency clearly demon- strated that HRIG was as effective as ARS in protecting animals that had been challenged with lethal doses of rabies virus. Sikes said that serum neutralizing antibody titers of animals receiving homologous antirabies globulin per- sisted five times longer than those given heterologouts gloibulin. Inter- ference from passive immunization was overcome by increasing the potency of the vaccine used for ac- tive immunization or by using a five- fold decrease in the titer of the globulin. The recent lot of 2,500 ml. of highly potent, purified HRIG has passed all laboratory tests required for its use in man, he continued. At least two studies of HRIG in man are planned for 1969. Following these studies, commercial development of HRIG under standards set by the NCDC Rabies Research Unit will be expected. C. diphtheriae Infections Most Hazardous in Skin Skin lesion carriers of Corynebac- terium diphtheriae infections are infected longer, disseminate o,rga- nisms into the environment more efficiently, and probably constitute a far greater public health threat than respiratory tract carriers. This con- clusion was among those reached by Dr. Mark A. Belsey and associates at the Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, La. They discussed the relative roles of respi- ratory infection, skin infection, and the environment in relation to the reservoir and transmission of C. diphtheriae infections. C. diphtheriae infections of skin lesions have recently been noted in several areas of the South, with prevalence rates ranging from 0.7 percent in an area free of diphtheria to 7.3 percent among patients or car- rier contacts. The seasonal pattern of diphtheria in the South is consist- ent with a significant role for skin to respiratory tract transmission, the authors reported. However, di- rect evidence that C. diphtheriae skin infections are important in the epidemiology of diphtheria has not been noted previously. The Studies The importance of the respiratory tract and the skin as sources of household infection and as potential human reservoirs was observed in 85 persons in 14 households. Six carrier households were in a neighborhood where diphtheria cases were occur- ring, the authors recounted, and eight households were unassociated with known diphtheria cases. The eight households were identified during C. diphtheriae carrier surveys in two parishes in southeast Louisi- ana. Cultures were taken from each of these 14 households every 10-14 days. Cultures were taken only once from 19 other households associated with cases of diphtheria. Air sampling and surface sampling in four households with skin infec- tion carriers and one household with respiratory carriers were also un- dertaken, the authors recalled. Swabs from the patient or from sur- faces in the household were streaked onto fresh moist Pai's egg medium, incubated at 35?C. for 12-16 hours, and transferred to Tinsdale's me- dium. Colonies suspected of being C. diphtheriae were transferred back to Pai's medium and typing and toxi- genicity determinations were done at the National Communicable Dis- ease Center, Public Health Service. Conclusion Secondary attacks were more common in households with C. diph- theria skin infections, the authors said, and in such households C. diph- theriae infection persisted longer than respiratory tract infections, provided household members had still had skin lesions. Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 207</page><page sequence="20">The authors noted that skin trans- mllission of C. diphtheriae appears to be constant throughout different epi- demiologic circumstances. Respira- tory tract transmission and infection is about equally as inmportant as skin infection in case-associated inci- dents, whereas it is of minor impor- tance in noncase-associated inci- dents. Indirect transmission by fomites does occur although its rela- tive role in comparison wvith other modes of transmission is unknown. Dermatophilosis Found In Man and Animals Diagnoses of derinatophilosis in various lower animals in the United States and demonstration of the dis- ease's transmissibility from ani- mals to man are recent significant developments in zoonotic mycoses, according to Dr. William Kaplan, of the National Communicable Disease Center, Public Health Service. Since instances of such direct transmis- sions of dermatophilosis to man have been reported, the disease is of po- tential public health impoirtance. Dermatophilosis and Ringworm Dermatophilosis should be differ- entiated from dermatophytosis, or ringworm, another skin disease caused by different agents, he ex- plained. Dermatophilosis is caused by an actinomycete, Dermatophilus congolensis, so named by Van Saceg- hem in 1915 after finding the disease in cattle in the Belgian Congo. Dermatophilosis has been reported in domestic and wild animals and is economically significant in some countries where livestock raising is an important industry. Losses result mainly from dam,age to hides, skins, and wool of infected animals. Dermatophilosis, Kaplan said, was first recognized in the United States in 1961. The number of known cases is still relatively small, but he be- lieves the disease is being overlooked and is more prevalent than it ap- pears to be. Kaplan urged increased use of laboratory procedures in differential diagnoses of skin disorders. The simplest and perhaps most practical method for diagnosing these dis- eases, he said, is demonstration of the etiologic agent by microscopic examination of stained smears of exudates, scabs, or crusts. Cultural studies are also useful in diagnosing dermatophilosis, he said. Another significant development in the zoonotic mycoses, Kaplan con- tinued, is control of ringworm in animals. In urban areas Micro- sporum canis, the common cause of ringworm in cats and dogs, may ac- count for more than 30 percent of the ringworm on exposed parts of the human body, and in rural areas 70 to 80 percent of the ringworm on man's exposed body surfaces is of animal origin. Consequently, he emphasized, control of ringworm in animals is of public health interest. Kaplan said that griseofulvin, an antibiotic, when given orally, is highly effective for treatment and control of ringworm in animals and man. By administering griseofulvin orally to treat infected animals and protect those which were suscep- tible, clipping and dipping infected animals, and instituting general sanitation measures, Kaplan said he eradicated ringworm from three cat- teries in the Atlanta, Ga., area. Systemic Mycoses Noting that nearly all systemic mycoses in man have their counter- parts in lower animals, Kaplan said that systemic mycoses are, however, not known to be transmittable be- tween lower animals and man. Nevertheless, recent developments suggest that animals play an indirect role in the epidemiology of histo- plasmosis and crytococcosis. Histoplasma capsulatum, the agent of histoplasmosis, is more likely to occur in soil contaminated with chicken and other bird droppings than in other soils, he observed. Re- cent studies have shown a similar associationi between H. capsulatum and soil from bat habitats, and other studies have shown that bats, unlike chickens and other birds, are natur- ally infected with the organism. These findings, Kaplan reported, have led to speculation that bats may play an active role in establish- ing new sources of infection and may be involved in transmitting histoplasmosis to other hosts. The consensus, however, is that bats- like other lower animals and man- are merely susceptible to infection with H. capsulatum and that their exereta, like that of birds, provide favorable soil conditions for growth of the organism. Concerning Cryptococcus neofor- mans, the agent of cryptococcosis, Kaplan said recent studies have shown that the organism is more likely to be found in 'sites contam- inated with pigeon and to a lesser extent other bird droppings. But, he concluded, since birds have not been found to be naturally infected with C. neoformafns, they apparently play an indirect role in the epidemiology of cryptococcosis. EVB Antibody Indicates Immunity to Mononucleosis Lack of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody indicates susceptibility to infectious mononucleosis (IM), ac- cording to Dr. James C. Neiderman, Dr. Robert W. McCollum, and Dr. Alfred S. Evans, Yale University School of Medicine. These investiga- tors described EBV antibody studies to elicit an epidemiologic pattern and clinical spectrum of IM. Connecticut has had a 25-fold in- crease in reported morbidity of IM in the past 20 years. The 1966 rate was about 50 per 100,000. Similar upward trends have been reporteid in Wisconsin, Sweden, and Czechoslo- vakia. Although the incidence of infec- tious mononucleosis has increased, particularly among young adults, epidemiologic studies have been limited by lack of an identifiable etiologic agent and a specific sero- logic test of immunity. Development of heterophile antibodies during ac- tive illness is a nonspecific response. The transient nature of heterophile response and its absence in patients with illnesses resembling IM has limited its usefulness in epidemio- logic studies, the authors explained. Since 1937, 91 volunteer trials to determine the etiology of IML have been reported. Of these, 69 yielded negative results, findings in 21 were equivocal, and in only one instance was transmission successful, the authors recalled. 208 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="21">The recent E!BV antibody studies in infectious mononucleosis have utilized immunofluoreseent tech- niques. Relationships of EBV anti- body to heterophile positive patients were demonstrated, and the occur- rence of EBV antibody in heterophile negative patients was established. The Yale Studies For 6 years serum specimens and histories of infectious mononucleosis were obtained from all students entering Yale University. When ill- ness developed (see chart), serial serum samples were collected from the patient during the acute and convalescent periods and in some instances several years later. E,BV antibodies appeared early in the dis- ease and reached peak levels in 4 or 5 weeks. Antibody levels were still demonstrable in serums ob- tained years later. The prevalence anld distribution of EBV antibody titers in serums ob- tained from 29 patients with IM showed that 100 percent of these heterophile positive patients had EBV antibodies at a level of 1: 80 or higher during illness. In a group of 50 healthy controls !of the same age, only 24 percent were antibody positive and had'antibody titers over 1: 80, presumably indicating past infection. Paired serums from more than 100 patients with acute infectious dis- eases also were tested. In no instance did EBV antibody develop during ill- nes;s nor was, a rise in antibody noted when it was present in serum taken during the acute phase. Six students who had illnesses ful- filling clinical and hematologic cri- teria for infectious, mononucleosis were studied. T'heir serums lacked heterophile antibodies, but the devel- opment of EBV antibodies was dem- onstrated. In each patient the total of lymphocyte;-monocyte percentage exceeded 60 percent during illness. These patientsi had high EIBV titers, and titers were comparable to those of the heterophile positive group. Serums obtained from two of these patients before illness were negative for EBV antibody. To correlate the incidence of in- fectious mononucleosis in relation to EBV antibody, 362 freshmen were followed for 4 years. A blood speci- men was obtained from all these per- sons on entry into college, and pre- vious histories o;f IM were recorded. Of 94 freshmen whose serums con- tained antibody, 6 percent had had infectious mononucleosis. None of these freshmen acquired IM during the next 4 years. Of 268 who were EBV negative, none had a history of IM, but 40 subsequently develloped the disease-an attack rate of nearly 15 percent. To study the extent of inapparent infection, matched serum samples were obtained from 150 university students 4-8 years after the first specimen had been collected. In this group, two had had IM ;before en- tering college and both were EBV antibody positive. During the next 4- 8 years, their EBV antibody status was unchanged, and they did not acquire IM. Fifty-one students whose serums contained EBV anti- body when they were admitted had no history of IM; on followup their aintibody pattern was unchanged, and none had IM in the interim. Of 97 students who were initially EBV antibody negative, 43 (44 per- cent) become EBV antibody positive during the next 4-8 years. Of these, 28 experienced clinically recogniz- able IM, aind 15 had no symptoms suggestive of IM. At 17-18 years of age, 53 of these 150 students (35 percent) were EBV antibody positive; several years later, at 21-26 years of age, 96 of 150 (64 percent) had demonstrable anti- bodies. This high attack rate sug- gested that these students from presumably higher socioeconomic groups remained susceptible as young adults and thus were able to acquire the infection. EBV Antibody in Other Groups A recent study of the prevalence of EBV antibodies among 1,700 chil- dren in western Connecticut showed a gradual increase in acquisition of antibodies during childhood, so that by the age of 12 years approximately 50 percent of the children were anti- body positive. Conversely, only 33 percent of 14 to 16-year-old boys en- tering a large preparatory sichool in 1968 had EBV antibodies, and ap- proximately 50 percent of the serums obtained from 17-year-old college students were antibody positive. Among these students, attack rates of IM would be expected to be high, the authors predicted.

This conversion rate of 37 percent compared closely with the 44 percent rate observed among Yale students. In contrast to pirevalence rates ranging from 24 to 50 percent among freshmen college groups in the United States, EBV antibodies were found in more than 90 percent of persons the same age in the Philip- pines and Colombia. among whom clinical cases of IM are rarely recorded. Bovine Epizootics Caused By Careless Laborers Bovine cysticercosis, a parasitic disease, can only be detected by meat inspection at the time of slaughter. Data from federally inspected abat- toirs during 1959-67 show that 12,000 to 16,000 cases are detected annually, reported Dr. Myron G. Schultz and Dr. John A. Hermos, National Com- municable Disease Clenter, Atlanta. The percentage of infected cattle de- tected during this period gradually declined (0.08 percent to 0.04 per- cent) until 1967, when the detected number of cases and the percentage infected increased over 1966. Most cases of cysticercosis were detected in federally inspected abattoirs in California (72.8 percent in 1967). Although the life cycle of the causative organism, Tacnia saginata, has been well known for many years, epidemiologic data *on its incidence and patterns of transmission in man and cattle in the United States have been limited. The interest of epide- miologists at the Communicable Dis- ease Center in this zoonosis was stimulated by their recent investiga- tion of a large epizootic of bovine cysticercosis in northern Texas. This investigation showed that 743 cat- tle in one feedlot were infected by a laborer infected with tapeworm who defecated in silage used for cat- tle food, and 170 cattle in another feedlot were infected by a laborer who was also a Taenia carrier and defecated in the cattle pens. To as- sess the effect of the epizootic on human taeniasis and to determine recent epidemiologic trends, Shultz and Hermos compiled data on the past and present incidence of cysti- cercosis and taeniasis in the United States. Estimating the incidence and prev- alence of human taeniasis is more difficult since it is not a report- able disease and the infection is frequently indolent. Schultz and Hermos surveyed State health de- partments, hospitals, and parasitolo- gists to collect data on T. saginata diagnoses made during the past 5 years; 429 cases were diagnosed in 43 State laboratories in a 5-year pe- riod and a far greater number of cases were diagnosed in hospital and private medical facilities. Epidemio- logic data on 1968 cases indicate that approximately one-third of the cases are acquired within the United States. Analysis of their data re- vealed regional and annual dif- ferences in the distribution and incidence of taeniasis that are sim- ilar to those of cysticercosis. Reduction in the transmission of this zoonosis, they said, will depend on further delineation of where the infected cattle originate, removal of Taenia carriers from cattle-raising establishments, continued vigilance in meat inspection, and the proper cooking of meat. African Green Monkeys Source of Virulent Virus The tissues of vervets, African green monkeys, should be handled with care, and direct contact with the tissues should be avoided by wearing protective gloves and cloth- ing. So concluded Dr. Robert E. Kissling and Dr. Roslyn Q. Robin- son, National Communicable Dislease Center, Public Health Service. They reported on the Marburg virus. The Outbreaks and the Organism During August and September 1967, 28 persons in Germany be- came ill following exposure to tis- sues of African green monkeys or to the blood of patients with a disease caused by what has since become known as the Marburg virus. The agent was so named be- cause 20 of the primary cases oc- curred in Marburg, Germany. One additonal case occurred in a lab- oratory worker in Yugoslavia, and a late case occurred in the wife of a patient. Seven paitients died 8 to 17 days after the onset of illness. Standard virological and electron microscopic techniques were used to determine the host spectrum, physio- chemical properties, and morphol- ogy of the agent. Serologic studies were performed using complement fixing antigens prepared from in- fected guinea pig tissues. The authors slaid that the charac- teristics of the organism's RNA genetic maiterial, heat and ether lability, and apparent helical sym- metry with cross striations on a cylindrical structure suggest that Marburg virus may be a member of the Stomatoviridae. They noted, however, that it is slightly wider and much more variable in length than other viruses in the group. The Vervets The monkeys associated with the outbreak consisted of two groups of Cerocopithecus species flown to London from Entebbe, Uganda, July 21 and 28, 1967. They were housed overnight at the airport's ani- mal hostel, shipped to Germany, and used within 7 days of their receipt by German laboratories. The initial infection may have been established during the stop- over in the animal hostel where the monkeys had indirect contact with various birds and animals, or, the authors speculated, the monkeys may have acquired the infection in their natural habitat. The authors stated that although confirmatory neutralization tests are necessary, other types of serological evidence suggest that vervets are exposed to Marburg virus in their natural habitat. However, if this is true, it is difficult to explain why problems have not arisen before. As possible explanations, the authors conjectured that perhaps the infec- tion is very rare or that the usual conditioning period after capture has furnished adequate time for any infected monkeys to recover and be- come noninfectious. 210 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="23">Using the imonkeys before they had been suitably quarantined or conditioned created an unnecessary rislk for the laboratory workers. Kis- sling and Robinson observed. At any rate, thley advisedl halnldlinig the tis- sues of green moinkeys with care and avoidinig contact with the tissues by wearing protective gloves and clothing. Nutrition External Stimuli Trigger Hunger in the Obese Obese subjects really do not know when they are hungry. When the food and circumstances of eating are uninteresting, they eat little. This result has led to the hypothesis that the eating of the overweight person may be triggered more by external than internal stimuli. Dr. Irwin M. Rosenstock, profes- sor of public health administration, University of Michigan School of Public Health, touched on some of the recent work of the psychologist Stanley Schacter in support of this hypothesis. Rosenstock believes that this work, which Schacter describes in an August 1968 issue of Science, has important implications for nu- trition education and the effective control of obesity. Self-reports of hunger coincide with gastric motility 71 percent of the time for normal subjects, in con- trast to 48 percent for obese persons. In Schacter's experiment, normal subjects who were physiologically hungry ate far more than those whose stomachs were full. Obese sub- jects ate the same amount whether their stomachs were empty o,r full at the beginning of the experiment. In support of the hypothesis that overweight persons may be more stimulated to eat by external stimuli of taste, smell, and sight than by internal physiological stimuli, Schac- ter cites a variety of research re- sults, said Rosenstock. For example, the more time the religious obese Jew spends in the synagogue, the less of an ordeal does he find the fasting for Yom Kippur. For a religious Jew of normal weight, however, the num- ber of hours in the synagogue has little to do with the difficulty of fasting; hunger is hunger. If subsequent research continues, to confirm the hypothesis that Schacter has been testing, Rosen- stock believes that we will need to consider ways of training people in internal (self-) control in the face of external stimuli. In one such at- tempt that has proved effective with obese patients desiring help, the pa- tient learns to control a series of components of his eating behavior. He starts with such simple things as interrupting a meal for a prede- termined period. The learning situa- tions progressively increase in scope and difficulty. Also certain barriers to eating are in(troduced. For exam- ple, a patient is instructed to remove food from all places in the house ex- cept the kitchen and, other than salad, to keep only food which re- quire-s preparation. Thus, he has cer- tain barriers involving some work which must be overcome before he can eat. Underlying all the specifics in this training plan is the principle that patients acquire self-control by ex- periencing immediate and continued success in their progressive efforts to manage their behavior. A fascinat- ing challenge, said Rosens;tock, would be for nutrition education to find ways of teaching children the progressive management of their own behavior and the means of reward- ing them for sielf-control when it oc- curs. We would begin, he said, with behavior that is relatively easy to control, for example, gradually re- ducing the candy eaten in any given day. Health workers have the right- and indeed, the obligation-to pre- sent information that will help their clients make rational decisions, Rosenstock believes. It is highly de- sirable to communicate information about the association between over- eating and longevity and between overeating and disease. It further seems appropriate to communicate information on the availability of ef- fective methods of control if such technology is developed. Never tlhe- less, there will be persons who possess all pertinent information, but whose motives and values require continued overeating. We have neither the right nor the obligation, Rosenstock declared, to attempt to change their view. Can U.S. Food Industry Tailor Foods for Health? What difficulties would be encoun- tered if, to improve the populace's health, a food industry were to alter the caloric or fat content of our foods? Dr. E. E. Rice and Dr. H. B. Lockhart, Research and Develop- ment Center of Swift and Company, Oak Brook, Ill., discussed some of the economic and other effects that might be expected if, for example, skim milk-made more palatable by the addition of nonfat milk solids- were to replace entirely whole milk as a beverage, if vegetable oils-in some instances the polyunsaturated ones-were substituted for animal fats in certain products such as froz- en desserts and Danish pastries, and if less fatty meats were used in sau- sage-type products. Use of Less Butterfat About 50 years ago, the average annual per capita consuimption of table spreads in the United States was about 15 pounds-all butter. To- day, Rice and Lockhart said, it is still 15 pounds, but noow about two- thirds is margarine. This shift from butter to margarine has created sur- pluses in butter, despite some de- creases in butter production. If the same amount of fluid milk with butterfat removed and nonfat milk solids added were consumed as formerly of fluid whole milk, the dairy farms would have to produce more whole milk than before. Two billion more pounds of butter would be added to our annual production and thus to our butter surplus. The value of this butter undoubtedly would be less than its present sup- port price, the authors pointed out. Producer, consumer, or both, would have to take a loss. Any reduction in farm prices would undoubtedly result in a decreased supply of milk. Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 211</page><page sequence="24">Therefore the consumer would prob- ably ultimately have to absorb the loss through a higher price for the low-fat fluid milk, they said, or else we all would have to pay taxes to support a butter subsidy price. Changes of this kind are difficult, Rice and Lockhart commented, not only because of the desire to protect established economic patterns but also because they demand a change in personal attitudes. To the dairy farmer, value in milk has been syn- onymous with fat; now he is asked to consider fat a nonentity or even a negative attribute. While the dairy farm was losing a market for 2 billion pounds of but- ter, the soybean, corn, and cotton farmers were gaining this market. Instead of producing milk, farmers began producing beans from which the processing industry manufac- tured margarine. The farmer can produce more fat per acre as beans than as milk and with less labor and a smaller investment in equipment and animals. As a result, the cost of soybean oil is appreciably less than the cost of butterfat, and mar- garine costs less than butter. Recently, several companies have marketed margarine with a high pro- portion of polyunsaturated fat, the authors reported. The raw material is essentially the same as for con- ventional margarines, but formula- tion and manufacture are different, special packages and new packaging equipment are needed, and promo- tional programs must be mounted. The farmer, however, gets the same price for his farm produce. The processing industry entails addition- al expense and charges for it. The consumer gets a modified product which he desires and for which he is willing to pay. Polyunsaturated Sausages Similarly, if naturally lean meat were trimmed and used for many sausage-type meat products, the lean- meat product would cost more than the kind currently on the market. On an equal protein basis, however, the costs of the two types of products would be about the same. In essence, the cost of the polyunsaturated prod- ucts would be increased by an amount equal to the cost of the vege- table oil, plus costs for extra han- dling in operations, distribution, pro- motion, and so forth. There is ample evidence, Rice and Lockhart concluded, that most of the processed foods can be tailored to desired specifications, thanks pri- marily to the advanced knowledge of food scientists. If there is a demand for new foods, they said, they will be produced. Comprehensive Health Care Includes Nutrition Help Clients of Denver's neighborhood health program are bussed twice monthly, after welfare checks arrive, to a discount-type store outside their neighborhood to shop for groceries. A home economist and nutrition aide accompany them to help in food buy- ing, meal planning, and babysitting. The buses are loaned by various com- munity agencies, and the drivers are provided by the welfare department. Explaining this service, Carol M. Watson, director of the nutrition section of the Denver Department of Health and Hospitals, commented as follows: Our families too often have but one choice to make. They have a small neighborhood store with fairly poor quality of fresh produce, a lim- ited selection of canned goods, and not a large selection of meat cuts. To get the mothers to come on trips to the discount store, we encourage them to bring their children. Nutrition services, Watson said, are provided in all of the medical care facilities participating in Den- ver's neighborhood health program. The nutritionist also makes home visits at the convenience of the patient. The neighborhood health program consists of two large neighborhood health centers, 12 neighborhood health stations (smaller facilities in defined neighborhoods), and three backup hospitals. It is designed, Watson explained, to go beyond the hospital and to provide care through organized health care groups. The staff, assigned on the basis of geog- raphy, is paid from several sources of funds. Early in the program's de- velopment, a public health nutrition- ist was hired to integrate nutrition services into the total operation. A nutritionist, a home economist, a dietitian, and nutrition aides are assigned to each neighborhood center. Role of Nutritionist The goals of the nutrition section, according to the author, are to pro- mote the best possible health for citizens by helping them learn how to have an adequate diet and how to meet-within their individual pref- erences and economic abilities-any special dietary needs related to a medical problem. To provide these services, she reported, we nutritiorn- ists take a complete diet history on every patient we see to find out his attitudes, what he eats, what he feels he can afford, and what he has to work with. Although this kind of approach takes time, Watson ex- pressed the belief that the knowledge gained prepares the nutrition staff to really help a patient at his level of understanding. We encourage the patient, she said, to continue his good practices as we slowly try to modify those which may not be so good. Home Economists and Aides In addition to setting up bimonthly grocery shopping trips for the pa- tients, the home economists have followed up on individual referrals from the nutritionists and have pro- vided detailed counseling on budget- ing and food-money management. They have also organized group classes on food preparation and bud- geting, Watson reported, and have conducted demonstrations such as one at a community health fair in the summer of 1968 showing how to prepare simple foods. The nutrition aides are women from the neighborhoods who lare trained for specific job needs. They learn, for example, how to do food demonstrations under guidance. We have asked, said Watson, that they be mature homemakers who have had children and have managed a home reasonably well. Watson goes into the homes to interview the ap- plicants. The three nutrition aides presently employed were trained by the home economist in total home management and child care. 212 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="25">Our neighborhood health program, the author concluded, provides an ideal framiework for nutrition serv- ices to be given in a ineaningful and worthwhile way. Nutrition is not a separate part of family life, she said, and in the family-centered health-care program we have an ideal opportunity to provide our services. How Safe Is, Canned Cured Meat? Cannecd cured meats receive about one-tenth the thermal processing of other low-acid foods. Yet, accord- ing to Hilliard Pivnick and F. S. Thatcher of the Food and Drug Laborato,ries ;of the Canadian De- partment of National Health anid Welfare, these meats have, with rare exceptions, an excellent safety rec- ord with respect to Clostridium bot alinum. One may ask, said the authors, how cured meat differs from oither low-acid foods so that it remains safe with a thermal process which is much less than that used for other low-acid foods. (A cured meat, they said, contains sodium chloride and usually also nitrite, nitrate, or both, although there is no requirement for a specific amount of any of these components.) To answer the ques- tion about safety, the authors pre- sented the results of their studies of the interrelationships of sodium chlo- ride, sodium nitrite, spore concentra- tion, and the thermal pro,cess in preventing formation of C. botulin- urn toxin. Pork luncheon meat containing various concentrations of sodium chloride, sodium nitrites, and spores of C. botulinum was canned anld processed to Fo-0.6. (In canning, the authors explained, all time-tempera- tures are equated to, the destructive activity obtained in 1 minute at 2500 F. One minute, at 2500 F. is: useed as a reference point, and the heat le- thality obtained is said to be Fo-1.0.) Meat devoid of curing salts be- caine toxic, reported Pivnick and Thatcher, if inoculated with only 1 sipore per gram. However, ineat con- taining 1 million spores per gram re- inained nontoxic during 18 mionths at 300 C. if it contained more than 6.2 percent brine (percent of NaCl in the aqueous phase of the meat), but be- came toxic if less salt was added. Toxinogenesis could be prevented within limits when the salt was de- creased if, concomitantly, the con- centration of nitrite was increased. Even 300 ppm of nitrite failed, how- ever, to prevent toxinogenesis when the brine was less than 4.5 percent. Many commercial meats contain less than 4.5 percent brine, the authors said, and most manufacturers add no more than 156 ppm of sodium nitrite. Pivnick and Thatcher therefore concluded that canned cured meats do not have the slame standards of safety as other low-acid foods. Their safety deipends, the authors, said, on a low popuilation oif spores in raw meat, the prevention through the addition of salt of outgrowth of heat-damaged spores, and a still unexplained activity of nitrite. The threat of biotulism, will remain, they declared, as long as there are no firm guidelines on the concentration of curing salts and the amount of thermal processing. They therefore suggested that perhapsi it may be time; for representatives of those in- dustries, foundations, and govern- inent agencies most concerned to convene a meeting to establish such guidelines. Dietary Habits of Girls Pregnant at 16 or Under Comprehensive medical care and supportive services, including nutri- tion counseling, apparently improve the outcome of pregnancy in girls who conceive at age 16 or younger. Florence Smith, a;ssistant director of the nutrition section of the Chicago Board of Health, and co-authors sup- ported this conclusion by citing re- sults of a comparison of pregnancy outcome in two groups of girls of this age level. The first group received care as high-risk patients under a special maternity and infant care project of the board. The second was composed of all girls of this age level in Chi- cago who delivered during the period of review, January 1965 to June 1967. All deliveries of project patients were performed at cooperating hos- pitals with residency programs in obstetrics. The nonproject patients received prenatal care from private physicians or hospital clinics, or had not received care. Negro patients comprised 92.9 percent of the project patients and 79 percent of the toital group. Differences in pregnancy outcome between patients who were in the projiect and those not in it were more pronounced among the Negro girls than in the total group. Nonproject Negroes had a prematurity rate of 19.2 as compared with 13.5 for proj- ect Negroes. Hebdomadal death rates among the Negro girls were 125 per- cent higher in the nonproject group than in the project patients. In Chicago, the rate of births to girls under 16 has risen from 12.0 per 10,000 live births in 1950 to, 51.3 per 10,000 in 1966, reported the authors. Pregnancy in the young girl, they said, is of major concern to the health team since increased obste- trical complications are likely in girls in the early teens. Despite the significance of age in pregnancy outcome, the authors em- phasized that the contribution of nutrition to the outcome should not be overlooked. If the girl's diet fails tol supply the nutrient needs of ad- olescence and her intake continues at the' same level during pregnancy, the girl and the infant may suffer ill effects. T'o obtain objective data on the food habits of these pregnant young girls, a questionnaire on the foods consumed was supplied fo'r each pa- tient interviewed by a nutritionist during the review period. A total of 996 completed and reviewed records thus became availabile. A rating of "good" for food habits was achieved by 30 percent of the pregnant teen- agers, "fair" by 26.4 percent, and "poor" by 43.6 percent. The majority, Smith and co-authors reported, ap- parently had a fair consumption of proteins of animal origin. A number, however, were following "less than desirable diets." The small am'ounts o'f milk and dairy produc'ts that some consumed probably indicate low levels olf dietary calcium, accord- ing to the authors. Ascorbic acid and vitamin A levels appeared to be at Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 213</page><page sequence="26">a minimal level in a good many as a result of limited use of fruits and vegetables. This limited use of fruits and vegetables also contributes to the lack of iron in the girls' diets. And lack of iron, the authors pointed out, is of special concern during preg- nancy when the need for this ele- ment inereases. New Meat Inspection Laws For Consumer Protection The 1967 Federal Wholesome Meat Act and the 1968 Federal Wholesome Poultry Products Acit are steps to- ward a new nationally uniforrm meat and poultry inspection program. Dr. R. K. Somers, deputy administrator of the Consumer Protection Program, U.S. Department of Agriculture, ex- pressed this view in discussing the impact of the new meat inspection act on the Federal meat inspection program. The speaker who followed Somers, Dr. L. R. Cro-well, director of the di- vision of meat inspection, New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, described the impact of the Wholesome Meat Act on his State. Objecting to some of the present pro visions for State-Federal co,opera- tion, he pointed out features whicb he believes a "truly cooperative" Federal-State me-at inspection pro- gram should include unless we are to have "virtually a complete Fed- eral inspection system." Impact at Federal Level Somers said that the two new acts, provide the Department of Agricul- ture with detention and sieizure au- thority so that it can control meat and poultry food products which are moving illegally or have, become adulterated or misbranded outside official premises. As of August 15, 1968, nearly 150' detentions involving approximately 1 million pounds, of products had been made under the WVholesome Meat Act [as of Decem- ber 15, 1968, 228 detentions involv- ing 2 million pounds.--R. K. S.] Preventive sanitation is an im- portant part of the nationally uni- form meat and poultry inspection program, according to Somers. Since meat and poultry processing plants are in essence large kitchens, they must be clean, he said, inside and out. Regular sanitation checks and reports are essential. AVe are also very concerned, he added, that waste disposal does not create a nuisance. The two new acts, Somers pointed out, provide for full intrastate con- sumer protection by giving author- ity for Federal assistance to the States fo,r improvement of their meat and poultry inspection pro- grams to an acceptable level. A sig- nificant provision, he stated, is the authority for establishing coopera- tive inspection programs. T h i s measure provides for Federal finan- cial, advisory, laboratory, and train- ing aid to the States to enable them to meet Federal standards within the required time. For example, said Somers, in calendar year 1968, we expected to provide training in slaughter operations to 600 State in- spectors, as well as to 850 Federal inspection personnel. As of August 15, 1968, the De- partment of Agriculture had coop- erative agreements with 23 States and had completed much of the preliminary work necessary for signing about six more. WVe believe, said Somers, that we are reaching our objective of a truly cooperative relationship in implementing the new meat inspection law. Progress toward the same objective in a co- operative poultry inspection pro- gram should be faster since the procedures have already been formu- lated. [As of December 15, 1968, the Department had signed cooperative agreements with 29 States. It had approved 39 State meat inspection laws as satisfactory for entering into cooperative inspection agree- ments; this action, however, does not mean final approval of the laws as being "at least equal to Federal inspection standards." As of Decem- ber 15, no State had qualified for "equal to" certification."-R. K. S.] Impact at State Level Crowell, on the other hand, ex- pressed the belief that changes at both the Federal and State level will be necessary before a "truly cooperative" Federal-State inspec- tion program can be achieved. New York, he reported, was the first State to sign a cooperative agree- ment with the Department of Agri- culture to receive reimbursement of up to 50 percent of the cost of de- veloping and maintainiing its meat inspection program at a level at least equal to Federal standards. Yet, he commented, a cooperative in- spection program in the true sense of the word still needs to be devel- oped in the State. A truly cooperative meat (or food) inspection program, Crowell stated, should provide eligibility for all establishments that are operat- ing under equal requirements to par- ticipate in interstate commerce. There should also be an interchange of Federal and State inspection per- sonnel, particularly in remote areas where both Federal and State agen- cies are presently folrced to adopt less efficient staffing procedures to maintain s e p a r a t e inspection programs. Crowell reported that when the Wholesome Meat Act wias passed, New York State had 495 plants un- der inspection. As of October 1, 1968, there were 397. Of these, 42 were granted Federal inspection, 59 discontinued operations requiring Federal inspection, and a small number were brought under inlspec- tion for the first time. But the State inspection program is expanding in another area. Leg, islative hearings to investigate al- leged diffeirences between the meat inspection programs of New York City and New York State resulted in the transfer of responsibility for meat inspection in the city to the State's department of agriculture and markets effective January 1, 1969. A survey indicated that 175 meat inspectors plus supervisory and management personnel will be needed to extend the State program to New York City. To teach meat inspector trainees procedures and requirements in processed meat inspection, said Crowell, we have contracted with a private firm for programed instruc- tion material. We hopie thereby, he commented, to shorten the training time and increase its effectiveneiss. Federal training centers have been used in training new inspectors in slaughter inspection techniques. 214 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="27">School Health Avoid Failure Syndrome By Early Intervention If a child is to be retained in a school grade, apparently the lower the grade-even kindergarten-the better. Children retained in first grade tend to show better achieve- menit than children retained in the second or third grade, according to research conducted by Dr. Carol Lee Griffin, director of pupil personnel services, Quincy (Mass.) Public Schools, and Dr. Helen Reinherz, cdirector of research, Simmons Col- lege of Social Work, Boston. Early Identification The authors undertook a study o-f 60 first- to third-grade boys who failed and were repeating a grade. Previous research had shown, they pointed out, that approximately one- half of the general achievement level at grade 12 has been reached by the end of the third grade. Thus, failure to develop positive learning patterns during the first three grades is likely to result in continued failure throuighooLt a child's entire school career. A large proportion of the boys in the study who had been character- ized as "immature" showed "satis- factory" achievement during the retained year, as opposed to children with less evidence of immaturity. Both parents and teachers reported that a number of "immature" chil- dren- had "matured" after an addi- tional year in the same grade. Most of the parents of failed children had been aware earlier that their chil- dren were having problems in school. As the failing child became older, attitudes of parents, teachers, and principals became more negative. An alarming observation, also, said Griffin and Reinherz, was that poor academic progress in the children studied was negatively associated with any contact with guidance coun- selors or special remedial programs. Analysis of the reasons why fail- ing children were not referred earlier for special help, revealed that they teDded not to be referred until the failure syndrome had consolidated- and was difficult or impossible to cure. It became increasingly clear, the authors said, that mental health and other remedial manpower can be deployed effectively only when help is offered at the earliest time possible. A yearly screening or test- inig program, they suggested, is needed to identify the emotional and educational assets and deficiencies of each child. A youngster with an evolving failure syndrome may then receive remedial help when inter- venltion is most effective. Study's Impact on Schools The results of the study provided a vehicle for meaningful dialog with elementary teachers, Griffin and Reinherz pointed out. The teachers became more sensitive to, different rates of maturation among children and came to recognize the close relationship between learning and maturation. They therefore began to seek alternatives to the traditional rigidly graded system and began to support more enlightened promo- tional policies. The study led teachers and admin- istrators to set up "transition" classes to bridge the gap between one grade and the next. Transition classes are attempts to allow chil- dren to proceed at their own rates and to experience success. Such pro- grams help prevent the development of failure syndromes in children who require a longer maturation period than others. Differences in maturation rates can also be ha ndled through innovative and flexible classroom groupings, said the authors. In schools having two or more classes at each grade level, children can be regrouped in accord- ance with itheir individual needs in a variety of ways. Each child can thus be provided with an environ- ment for learning that allows him a greater opportunity to, develop a sense of mastery and proficiency as a learner. These methods, however, break down when in the following year the child still has not caught up with his peers and does not meet the requirements of the next grade. These problems, the authors pointed out, suggest the need for an indi- vidualized curriculum in which each child moves at his own rate and is not compared with others or judged by a predetermined standard. Identifying Pupil at Risk of Future Learning Problem If, instead of a single etiological factor such as a brain damage syn- drome, we assume that a constella- tion of behavioral characteristics affects learning to different degrees and in different ways, perhaps, said Dr. John M. Lampe, we can go ahead and achieve some pragmatic solutions to learning and behavioral problems. The author, who is a school physician of the public schools of Denver, Colo., pointed out, "at the risk of generalizing and oversimplifying," that some in- vestigators have concluded that neu- rological, electroencephalographic, psychometric, behavioral, and psy- chophysiologic factors do not always correlate. One investigator even has gone as far as to say there is no such thing as a brain damage syndrome. Method T'herefore, in search of pragmatic solutions, the staff of the Public Health Services Department of the Denver Public Schools undertook a study of early identification of the child considered to be at risk of neurogenic learning disorders. Spe- cifically, said Lampe, we hoped to determine whether a relationship existed between identifications made by a nurse using techniques familiar to her and identifications made by a classroom teacher based upon her observations and experience. The study, carried out in 1967-68, involved 585 pupils in the kinder- gartens of six elementary schools. In two schools, the school nurses conducted a personal interview with the parents of each enrolling kinder- garten pupil. This interview was structured around a questionnaire designed to elicit information con- sidered pertinent in identifying chil- dren deemed to be at risk in regard to future learning. In two of the Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 215</page><page sequence="28">four other schools, nurses asked the parents to fill out the questionnaire but did not interview them or further communicate with them about the matter. The remaining two schools served as controls, and par- ents were given the enrollment forms ordinarily used. Each nurse made a determination for each kindergarten pupil in her school as to whether or not he would encounter learning difficulty. After the first semester, the kindergarten teachers were asked to make the same dichotomous judgments for each pupil in their classes. At the close of the school year, the teachers again were aisked to make a judg- ment, this time indicating (on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 meaning "severe" and 5 "no difficulty") the degree of difficulty each child might be expected to encounter in the future. With the teachers' judgments as the criterion, the correlations be- tween their judgments and those of the nurses for each set of two schools were calculated (see table). The significance of the difference be- tween these three sets of correlation coefficients was then calculated in order to determine which of the three judging methods best pre- dicted future educational difficulties. Results The highest correlations obtained were between the teachers' first and second ratings. The correlations be- tween the nurses' and the teachers' judgments were highest among the interview group when the teachers' second rating on the 5-point scale was used as the criterion. The cor- relation coefficient between the nurses' judgments and the teachers' second judgments (0.09) for the con- trol group and for the interviewed group (0.32) were found to be sig- nificantly different at the 0.05 level. No significant differences were fouind for the corresponding coeffi- cients among the questionnaire and control groups or among the ques- tionnaire and interview groups. Thus, the interview method deter- mined potential pupil educational difficulties better than the enroll- ment forms presently in use. Legislators Try to Meet Health Education Needs Critical health legislation which passed the New York State Senate aiid Assembly on May 2, 1967, is based on a recognition that the study of health extends to the study of man as he interacts with his environment. Epidemiology is to be used in studying health problems such as smoking and addiction to drugs. New York State Senator Edward J. Speno of Mineola, L.I., who spon- sored the legislation, described the measure and its origin. Implementa- tion, he said, requires the coopera- tive effort of every major health organization in the State which supports the school health education program. Yet, he noted, the average educator may well ask, "How come legislators are getting involved in curriculum planning?" In explanation, Speno narrated the history of the new legislation. Smok- ing and abuse of drugs, and alcohol, he said, have reached such epidemic proportions among America's youth that legislators are obliged to pro- vide laws and funds ;to cope wvith these health hazards. First, however, they need to know what is already being done to ameliorate the prob- lems. An investigation of curricu- lar offerings in health education revealed a void too serious and too glaring to perpetuate, according to Speno. The legislators found, he said, that attention to health educa- tioIl in the schools is too often cursory, token, scattered and, in some cases, even reluctant. In intro- ducing legislation to fight illness and disease among young people, said the senator, the legislators are serv- ing as catalysts, not intruders. Specifically, the author stated, the New York State legislation provides $250,000 yearly to underwrite a 5- year program concerned with such critical health problems of young people as cigarette smoking, illicit use of drugs and narcotics, and ex- cessive use of alcohol. The thrust of the legislation is threefold- teacher training, curriculum change, and adult and community infor- mation. The bill will ask colleges to expand their curricular commitments to health education by enlarging exist- ing departments in this field and de- veloping new ones. It calls for the establishment of state-wide on-the- job training programs for teachers. Such programs will enable school districts in the State to establish local health training programs for their teachers leading to certification by the State department of educa- tion as health education teachers. For the junior and senior high schools in the State literally 2,3)00 highly trained health education teachers are needed at the very out- set. Yet, last year only 200 health education teachers were graduated from New York colleges and univer- sities, Speno pointed out. In the elementary schools, he said, the aver- age teacher is no better prepared to teach about health than the average Correlation coefficients between judgments of teachers and nurses in respect to 585 children Study groups Teacher Teacher by persons making judgments Nurse (lst (2d rating) rating) Interview group (211 children): Nurse -1. 00 0. 18 0. 32 Teacher (1st rating) - -1. 00 . 55 Teacher (2d rating) - - -1. 00 Questionnaire group (163 children): Nurse -1. 00 . 28 . 19 Teacher (lst rating) - -1. 00 .48 Teacher (2d rating) - - -1. 00 Control group (211 children): Nurse -1. 00 . 11 . 09 Teacher (lst rating) - -1. 00 .34 Teacher (2d rating) - - -1. 00 216 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="29">housewife. To close this inforination gap, 21 video tapes dealing with so- ciological health problems, environ- mental and public health, and physi- cal health have been produced. No college credit is given to the elemen- tary teachers, but salary increments are offered. In response to the new legislation, said the author, a State regulation on health education has been revised to require a one-semester course at the junior and senior high school levels, in addition to health instruc- tion at the elementary level. The theory, concluded the senator, is that education to prevent the develop- ment of critical health hazards is more successful than rehabilitation. Show Students Better Ways To Enrich Life Than Drugs What we need to do in the schools, declared Marvin R. Levy, director of the drug abuse education project of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, National Education Association, is to provide students with alternatives to drug use by which they can attain satisfaction. Instead of being pompously critical of student drug abuse, he said, we should demonstrate that there are better and less dangerous ways to experience the richness of living than ingesting chemicals. If, continued the author, we are truly to educate students in the full- est sense, we must help them to find these olther ways. The school must strive to help the student become a human being capable of making rational decisions since, in the final analysis, the decision about drugs still rests with him as an individual. Levy expressed the belief that every effort must be made to create an honest, free, 'and open setting- a milieu in which a student may ex- amine alternatives and make deci- sions that will result in the actions that will be best for him and those he affects. Any urgency that we may feel must be redirected, Levy stated, toward restructuring the school en- vironment with a view !to making each student's experience relevant for him in terms of his own needs, interests, and aspirations. It would be a calamity, the author declared, if we were to allow the urgency we feel to result in school policies which punish rather than support, alienate rather than enlist, frustrate rather than hearten, injure rather than par- don and which sow hatred rather than love, doubt rather than hope, and darkness rather than light. In teaching about drugs, encount- ers can be planned, said Levy, with resource persons from the fields of sociology, psychology, psychiatry, and treatment and rehabilitation. Schools should provide teachers time in the school day for discussion with students of topics of mutual concern. No agenda, no curriculum is necessary, he pointed out-just the time for free exchange of ideas. Starter questions can be used to get discussions rolling and to serve as a springboard for meaningful en- counters. Schools might well provide a setting, he concluded, where stu- dents can come to talk to each other and to adults regarding mat- ters of concern to them. At Least One Child in Ten Has Learning Disability At least 11 percent of the mo,re than 18,000 elementary pupils in Berkshire County, Mass., are work- ing below their potential or have possible learning disabilities, accord- ing to a recent survey of their teach- ers. Moreover, Dr. Eugene Talbot, senior psychologist at Austen Riggs Center, Inc., Stockbridge, Mass., ex- pressed the belief that this percent- age might have been twice as high had the teachers understood that they were to list pupils already re- ceiving remedial help as well as those in need of it. The survey was part of a pilot study to determine the number and characteristics of elementary school children who, ithough of average in- telligence or above, are regarded as being in difficulty educationally and to learn what their teachers consider important influences or explana- tions. The survey, conducted on a limited budget of $1,000, was spon- sored by a local united community service organizatio-n cooperating with a multidiscipline advisory group. The teacher was asked to identify the conditio,n or difficulty and its degree that made her suspect a learn- ing disability. Then, for each of 15 problem areas, the teacher was asked to check the degree of difficulty (for example, motor coordination). She was also urged to comment. With followup calls and "mild coercion" in a few instances, a remarkable 10) pereent return of questionnaires was achieved, Talbot reported, from the 30 distinct school organizations and 73 different elementary schools in the county. Results Approximately equal numbers of pupils in each of the six elementary grades were listed as working below potential or having posisible learn- ing (disabilities. This result may indi- cate, said Talbot, that current reme- dial approaches are relatively inef- fective. Boys listed outnumbered girls 21/2 to 1. Reading was the most frequent area of disability-81 per- cent of the children listed by the teachers were said to have trouble with reading. Arithmetic was not far behind-76 percent of the listed pupils, followed by spelling-69 per- cent. Eighty-four percent of the chil- dren listed were described as having difficulties in attention span and concentration. About 50 percent were judged to be hyperactive and nervous, and 50 percent were con- sidered slightly to significantly im- mature. Thirty percent were reported to have from some to significant dif- ficulty in motor coordination. Teachers wrote comments about approximately 950 of ;the 1,989 chil- dren they listed as having educa- tional problems. A frequent obser- vation was that a child was not learning because he was "poorly mo- tivated" or a "poor worker" or "lazy or slow." Teachers who wrote such a comment tended to express little hope that the child could be helped. Physical difflculties, particularly poor eyesight, were often noted. "Immature" was a favorite adjec- tive. The teachers related the school difficulties of more than one-third of the 1,989 children in part to home problems. The poor self-image of some of the children troubled a num- ber of teachers. Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 217</page><page sequence="30">Based oni this survey, concluded Talbot, the prevalence of educa- tional disabilities is dangerously high. All of us whose professions bear upon the growth, development, and learning of children, he said, must pool our knowledge and efforts in a search for social and educational in- venltions that will give each child an optimal opportunity to learn and to grow. Ounce of Cure Is Worth Pound of Prevention The key principle in effectiveness, Dr. Allan Y. Cohen, assistant pro- fessor of psychology, John F. Ken- nedy University, Martinez, Calif., told a panel on preventive ap- proaches to drug abuse, is not in preventing drug experimentation- which may be inevitable. It is rather in preventing drug abuse-which is preventable. This result can be achieved, he said, by shifting the educative focus to decision making about one's use of drugs, a shift which implies concentration on the criteria for analyzing drug effects. Latest 1968 estimates suggest that up to 70 to 75 percent of graduating high school seniors in metropolitan urban areas, especially on the east and west coasts, have tried illicit drugs ranging from barbiturates and stimulants to mild and strong hallu- cinogens. These figures do not mean, Cohen cautioned, that the majority of our young people are drug users, but that they have experimented with these popular substances. To prevent experimentation, the a uthor stated, seems close to sheer fantasy. Almost everyone uses one kind of drug or another, he pointed out. People cannot be effectively frightened away. Attitudes about drugs are an individual matter. Ef- fective drug education should make their abuse less desirable, said the author. Young people should be taught about drugs in such a way that they can rationalize their dis- continuance of harmful ones at any stage of drug experimentation. Emphasis should be centered, Cohen believes, on such topics as "How to decide when you are using too much." This approach, he said, will make the potential marihuana user, for example, "super-alert" to side effects which he now ignores because he is so busy defending marihuana's nonexistence as a nar- cotic. Such an orientation, Cohen stated, can be as effective with users as pre-users. It gives people a chance to cut down or stop on their own volition instead of laughing inwardly at the horrors of drug use that are put forth in the all-or-nothing ap- proach. Students respond amazingly well, the author reported, when ap- proached with the general line, "Obviously you can take drugs if you decide to and we are in no posi- tion to tell you that you shouldn't. However, here are some things to keep in mind. . ." Congruent with this decision-mak- ing model, Cohen added, is emphasis on the reasons why people take drugs and whether or not drugs help them to get what they really want. Term "Drug Abuse" Applies To All Kinds of Drugs The most publicized incidents of drug abuse are those involving young people, while the more complex as- pects of the problem receive little attention. This is the belief of Jack E. Gross, director of Project RFD (Respect for Drugs) and of student and community relations at the Col- lege of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Columbia University, New York City. Project RED is sponsored by the Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (contract J-68-28). We must be equally if not more concerned, Gross stated, about the abuse of legally prescribed and pro- prietary medications. He cited the following example. UpoIn the sugges- tion of her physician, a young woman had been taking a medication for several years at the onset of a cold. One evening she gave a friend some of the tablets because she recognized symptoms similar to her own. Within a half hour, the friend was wheezing and having difficulty breathing. Be- fore an ambulance could be sum- moned, the friend had died. The drug used was penicillin; the girl had ex- perienced anaphylactic shock. This is an example of intentional drug abuse, declared the author. By defini- tion, intentional drug abuse implies a willingness to take the drug, a lack of knowledge regarding the drug's full range of effects, and the absence of a properly diagnosed disease. Gross suggested that pharmacists and physicians, who have a wealth of knowledge on drugs, should serve as resource speakers for educators who must arrange programs on drugs. Teachers who have a back- ground in the biological sciences, he also suggested, could easily strength- en their command of pharmacology, and become drug-education special- ists in their schools. Youngsters should be informed that many commonly used drugs can be far more dangerous physiologi- cally than narcotics, stimulants, and depressants, said the author. Nico- tine and alcohol are both more toxic than heroin when used over long periods. In fact, deaths caused by the abuse of drugs are rarely brought about by the drugs them- selves, said Gross, but by related factors. Addicts may become ill as the result of using unsterile equip- ment for administering drugs. LSD and methiamphetamine are two drugs commonly manufactured in home laboratories without the sophisti- cated equipment necessary to purify and test the end product. Because young people usually take drugs in order to "feel good," when we tell them not to use drugs for this purpose, we are asking them to change their behavior, Gross com- mented. But it is unreasonable, he said, to ask people to make difficult changes without providinig a new way to deal with "bad feelings." Per- haps, he suggested, educators should spend time working in groups with one another, trying to change some of their own negative behavior and attitudes. People who have become stagnant and closed to change have probably forgotten what frustrations and hurts are entailed in changing oneself. The person who is willing to share emotional experiences and feelings with young people, said Gross, is the person who will be able to ciommunicate. Gross reported that the College of Pharinaceutical Sciences is training comnmunity pharmacists to serve as resource speakers to aid in commu- 218 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="31">nity and school education programs on drugs. The college's Project RFD also stresses the importance 'of hav- ing all pharmacists maintain records on medications of families to assist in the detection and prevention of the abuse of drugs in general. Phar- macists are also being asked, he said, to post information about narcotic control agencies and to use their pharmacies as community drug in- formation centers. Distribution of Absences Among School Children A scientific base for current school nursing practices appears to be gen- erally lacking, stated nurse consult- ant Dolores Basco, Division of Nurs- ing, Bureau of Health Manpower, National Institutes of Health. She presented a report by Dr. Doris E. Roberts, chief of the Community Nursing Branch of the division, and four co-authors (including Basco). It described the first phase of the division's longitudinal study of ab- sences and health problems of school children. The study was undertaken in 1967 with the cooperation of the Dela- ware State Department of Public Instruction and the Delaware State Board of Health. Its purposes, Basco explained, are to help establish a scientific base for nursing practices by identifying the characteristics of groups in the school population who are at high risk of absence and ill- ness and to design and test new pat- terns of nursing service for these groups. The results are expected to contribute to the prevention, detec- tion, treatment, and correction of health defects in school populations. For the first phase of this under- taking, data were abstracted from 1966-67 and 1967-68 school health records and school cumulative and attendance records for a random stratified sample of 2,080 pupils in grades 1, 4, 7, and 10 of Delawlare schools. These data were related to 23 selected variables pertaining to the pupil's age, sex, race, ordinal posi- tion, mobility, grade point average, height and weight, immunization status, and reported health condi- tions; also, to the size of house- hold and to the occupation, marital status, education, and religion of his parents; and to the characteris- tics of the participating schools, that is, their size, urban or rural location, and their proportion of white and nonwhite students. Preliminary analysis of the data suggests high absence is associated with having a low grade point aver- age, being overage for grade, having low socioeconomic status, coming from a broken home, attending school in a large urban area, being in the 10th grade, and being non- white. Thus, liability to absence from school was found to be a highly complex phenomenon stem- ming from interacting social, educa- tional, and demographic conditions. Attendance patterns of the study population were remarkably consis- tent over a 2-year period, reported Basco, and these data made it pos- sible to prepare a statistical model which can be used to predict the liability to absence of an individual pupil. Thus, commented the author, we have a measure to use in evaluating the possible effects of a changed pattern of nursing practice. Another point Basco brought out is that, among young men unquali- fied for military service, many were found to have health defects which had gone uncorrected during their school years. According to the Na- tional Health Survey, the 6-16 year age groups had almost 330 million days of restricted activity associated with acute illness anid 60 million days associated with injury from June 1966 to July 1967. Also, a review of the pertinent literature for charac- teristics to be included in the situdy revealed that information about the kinds of pupils who are most vul- nerable to ill health is sparse. Reporting of Child Abuse By School Personnel Mandatory reporting by school personnel of suspected cases of child abuse has been very productive in identifying these children, accord- ing to Dr. C. George Murdock, director of the school health service of Syracuse, N.Y. The New York State law on child abuse, which became effective July 1, 1964, makes the reporting of any suspected case mandatory for physi- cians, dentists, osteopaths or the superintendent, manager, or person in charge of any hospital, sani- tarium, or other institution where such a child is being treated. Legal immunity is granted for such re- porting. Local and State legal coun- sel, said Murdock, have interpreted the phrase "other institution" to include schools. The school program has been the greatest single source of uncovering child abuse in Syracuse, Murdock reported. It has been invaluable, he siaid, in identifying abused children of school age since, in most cases, the injuries are not severe enough to necessitate care by a physician. Methods and Results Two full-time social workers from the children's division of the county department of social welfare were assigned to investigate suspected cases of child abuse in Syracuse. The workers subsequently referred cases to the local family court if punitive action was deemed necessary. A central registry 'was established to provide for other reports from dif- ferent sources, such as physicians and hospitals. This cumulative file, said Murdock, often revealed re- peated abuse of the same child or other siblings and strengthened the position of the children's division when court action was deemed neces- sary. The author expressed the be- lief that central registers at State and national levels should be estab- lished because of the extreme mobil- ity of the families involved in child abuse. In the school year 1964-65, 18 cases of suspected child abuse were reported through the Syracuse school system; in 1965-66, 20 cases; in 1966-67, 24 cases; and in 1967-68, 18 cases. The cases involved children from 5 to 12 years, but the younger age groups were predominant, prob- ably, suggested the author, because younger children have a predilec- tion to involvement in provocative situations. The injuries sustained consisted mainly of ecchymosis and welts in- flicted in whippings, but there were also lacerations caused by knives or Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 219 331-830-69- 3</page><page sequence="32">other sharp objects. The perpetra- tors were frequently found to be emotionally disturbed, mentally handicapped, or were chronic alco- holics. When a stepparent was in- volved, his relationship to the real parent often was by common law only and impermanent. Almost all cases came from the lower socio- economic group, contrary to what other investigators have found. The children's division returns a copy of each report on the disposi- tion of the case to the person who made the initial referral. This pro- cedure helps maintain interest in the program and gives the person refer- ring the case a sense of accomplish- ment, Murdock commented. Possible Problems Among the difficulties that may be encountered in carrying out the child protection program, the author cited the reluctance of school plersonnel to report suspected cases for fear of legal involvement and court appear- ances as well as inadequate coopera- tion between the school system and the investigating agency. T'he reluc- tance to report can be overcome, he noted, by a proper p,resentation of the problem, especially in a State in which reporting is mandatory. Fre- quent exchange of information be- tween the school system and the investigation agency should be en- couraged, he said, not only in the initial reporting but also in the con- tinued observation of cases of child abuse. Murdock pointed out that the recommendations of the Committee on Infant and Pre-School Child of the American Academy of Pediatrics regarding child abuse are excellent. He would only add "and school per- sonnel and school systems" to "physicians and hospitals" in the statements. Radiological Health Stress Need for Control Of X-ray Beam Sizes The projected increase in the genetically significant radiation dose to the U.S. population within 10 years may be two to four times greater than the estimated 1964 levels and three to eight times greater by 1990 unless improvements are made in controlling X-ray beam sizes, reported Norman S. Kessner and Morton L. Brown of the Public Health Service's Bureau of Radio- logical Health. The rise in the genetically sig- nificant dose is projected on the basis of anticipated yearly increases in the use of X-rays for medical diagnosis in the United States. The biological consequences of the projected genet- ically significant dose rise are not assessable on the basis of present knowledge, according to the authors. The genetically significant dose is derived from a formula used'by the United Nations Scientific Commit- tee on Effects of Atomic Radiation to estimate the radiation exposure of' genetic import for persons of childbearing age. A Bureau study of population exposure to X-rays dur- ing 1964 placed the annual genetic dose per person from medical X-ray examinations at 55 millirads, or 55 thousandths of a rad, the unit of radiation dose. The authors pointed out that the average genetically sig- nificant dose from background radia- tion is estimated to be 125 millirads. The projections also indicate that if complete control of X-ray beam sizes can be aehieved by 1975, the genetically significant dose for that year will be lower than that esti- mated for 1964 despite continued growth in the application of X-rays in medical diagnosis. In more than half of the X-ray examinations performed in 1964, X-ray beams were larger than nece.s- sary to expose the film. Bureau esti- mates show that the genetically sig- nificant dose in 1964 might have been 60 percent lower if all exami- nations had been made with X-ray beams restricted to minimum re- quired sizes, the authors stated. The Department of Health, Edu- cation, and Welfare has applied for a patent on an automatic collimator developed by the Bureau for auto- latically narrowing X-ray beamiis to film -size or smaller. X-ray equip- ment manufacturers are also devel- oping similar devices. Effects of Radiation On Urban Wastewaters In highly urbanized areas, in- creasing population densities and industrial activities are sorely press- ing ,the present capabilities of bio- logi,cal treatment of wastewater effluents. Satisfactory water quality can be maintained in such areas only if more efficient iand advanced waste- water treatment methods are used to supplement existing capabilities. Thus, research was undertaken to evaluate the potential benefits of treating municipal land industrial wastes with ionizing radiation. Part of that evaluation was reported by Dr. C. J. Touhill and co-authors from zthe Pacific Northwest Labora- tory, Battelile Memorial Institute, Richland, Wash. Two major objectives of the re- search were (a) to investigate the effects of radiation on industrial effluents containing cyanides, phe- nols, and petroleum-related wastes and (b) to investigate -the effects of radiation on bacteria and viruses commonly found in municipal waste- water streams. The experiments were conducted in static and dy- namic environments, according to the authors. The'parameters studied were pressure, temperature, cata- lysts, gaseous environment, concen- tration, radiation dose rate, and total radiaition exposure. The effec- tiveness of radiation in treating wastewater was assessed by deter- mination of noxious chemical degra- dation and mirco-organism kill. The results of the experiments showed that both cyanides and phenols could be readily degraded to innocuous end products under cer- tain conditions. On the other hand, the degradation of petroleum-related wastes was quite limited at total radiation exposures of less than 106 roentgens. Cyanide degradation is highly dose-rate dependent, while phenol destruction is enhanced by aeration during irradiation, the authors reported. The experimental results also led 220 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="33">to the conclusion that the effect of radiation dose rate does not signifi- cantly influence the degree of either bacterial or viral kill.. Rather, the authors pointed out, organism kill is principally a function of total radiation exposure. Organism kill curves were devel- oped for total counts, coliforms, Escherichia coli phage plaques, en- terococci, and spores as a function of radiation dose rate and total expo- sure. At a total dose of 2.5X 105 rads, the following approximate per- centages were obtained: total counts, 99.9 percent; coliforms, 100 percent; enterococei, 100 percent; spores, 92 percent; and E. coli phages, 100 per- cent. The authors noted that the re- sults of the research have been used as a basis for a conceptual design of the nation's first full-scale waste- water irradiation facility. Dose Reduction by Using Electronic Radiographs To achieve for future populations a distinct reduction in the contribu- tion of medical X-ray exposures to the genetically significant dose, new concepts of diagnostic X-ray visuali- zation and utilization must be gen- erated, developed, and clinically evaluated. For example, recent de- velopments in single-frame tele- vision X-ray image storage provide a basis for "electronic radiography" systems which would permit a marked reduction in radiation ex- posure to both patients and person- nel, according to William 11. Miller, Jr., who is conducting contract stud- ies at Emory University School of Medicine for the Public Health Serv- ice's Bureau of Radiological Health. By combining the image integra- tion capability of the television camera tube with a synchronized electronic memory, a continuously displayed television image from a conventional fluoroscopic image in- tensifier can be produced with a single low-intensity X-ray exposure of one-sixtieth to one-tenth second. These images may be presented in- dividually or at a predetermined sequence rate. Electronic radiographic systems may be designed for both fluoroscopic and radiographic techniques. In many situations, continuous fluoros- copy can be replaced by single or sequence instantaneous electronic radiographs with one-hundredth to one five-hundredth the normal fluoro- radiation exposure. In certain radio- graphic procedures, acceptable im- ages may be obtained with 1 to 2 milliroentgens per exposure or about one five-hundredth that required for a film radiograph. Holds M.D.'s Responsible For Wise Use of X-rays Presenting some of the concepts that define judgment in the use of diagnostic radiology in medicine, Dr. William S. Cole, Bureau of Radio- logical Health, Public Health Serv- ice, said that such use is the re- sponsibility of the physician. Ideally, he continued, radiology should be a consultative procedure in which the referring practitioner discusses with the radiologist the indications for an examination of his patient. However, the scarcity of radiologists, by number as well as location, pre- vents this highly desirable procedure from being a fact in medical com- munities. As a result of this scarcity, the indications for applying ionizing radiation and the frequency of re- examination must be determined by the referring physician. Therefore, Cole said, this physician's judgment should be influenced by a thorough knowledge of ;the benefits to be gained by the procedure versus the potential risk !to his patient. A radiological examination must not be used as a substitute for proper history and physical exami- nation, Cole stressed. It should be considered a means of substantiating a diagnosis rather than a means of determining a diagnosis by exclu- sion. A physician must not deny ra- diological examination when it is indicated; however, 'Cble recom- mended, he should discourage the occasional patient who demands an X-ray without some relation to pos- sible pathology. Obviously, education in the cor- rect use of ionizing radiation should begin in medical school, Cole stated. Only through a continuing process of education is the practicing physi- cian able to appreciate and apply the information available from modern sophisticated radiological proce- dures. Transfer of this kind of knowledge from the academic insti- tutions to the practitioner is one of the most difficult problems in the con- tinuing education field. Research into the productivity of specific examinations such as fluoros- copy, diagnostic procedures during pregnancy, chest X-rays, and preem- ployment examinations is necessary to determine which should be re- quested and which should not be re- quested in a given medical situation, Cole proposed. An example, he pointed out, is determination of the productivity of preemployment X-rays of the lower back. Radio- graphic examination of the lumbar spine and the bony pelvis should not be a routine procedure. It should be limited to persons with a definite his- tory and physical findings of lower back instability. When X-ray exami- nation is indicated, Cole recom- mended that it be performed with precise collimation, proper selection of film size, and careful gonadal shielding. A physician's reason for requesting a radiographic examination may ap- pear to be intuitive, but it actually reflects a breadth of knowledge and experience in medicine. This process, Cole concluded, may well define clinical judgment. Try Computer Methods in Hospital X-ray Department A detailed study of diagnostic radiology functions in a hospital identified two major problems-re- porting of X-ray findings and locat- ing X-ray films-which appeared amenable to the application of com- puter techniques. Thus, said Dr. Stanley 1. Margulies of Johns Hop- kins Hospital and Joseph N. Gitlin of the Public Health Service's Bureau of Radiological Health, a Bureau- supported pilot study was conducted at the hospital to determine the feasibility of using computer tech- niques in the X-ray department. A system was designed to "auto- mate" the reporting of X-ray find- ings and to provide information on the location of X-ray films within the Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 221</page><page sequence="34">hospital. A coded radiology lexicon containing pathological terms and re- lated anatomical sites was developed and programed for the immediate printing of an X-ray report and for future retrieval. The remote terminal used in the pilot study consisted of a card-reader to record basic patient and examination data, a matrix key- board to transmit the pathological and anatomical statements by the radiologist, and a printer to produce copies of the report. To facilitate film library control, a random access file was prepared which contains patient identification and examina- tion data including the type of X-ray procedure, the date of examination, and the file location of portfolios for each patient examined since July 1965 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The design of the demonstration project, which is now underway, is based on the experience gained in the pilot study conducted during the first 6 months of 1968. Efforts are being directed at the collection of data to measure the efficiency and effective- ness of the system, as well as record- ing subjective impressions of the hardware and software used in the design. A major objective of the project, the authors reported, is to determine the adaptability of such a system for use at other hospital centers which have similar operational problems. This adaptation would permit the es- tablishment of a data bank for re- search in diagnostic radiology and for the production of current in- formation on X-ray practice and trends in patient exposure for pub- lic health control programs. It is also anticipated that the protocol devel- oped in the demonstration project for utilizing data generated by the system will be useful for improving professional and technical training and clerical management within ra- diology departments. Analytical X-ray Equipment: Safety Recommendations Recent studies show that a signifi- cant number of reported radiationl injuries have resulted from accidents involving X-ray diffraction and spectographic equipment. For a fur- ther evaluation of the potential haz- ards associated with this equipment, the Public Health Service's Bureau of Radiological Health and the Penn- sylvania Department of Health con- ducted a joint survey of 42 analytical X-ray units. The recommendations and results of the survey were pre- sented by Thomas M. Moore of the Bureau and Donald J. McDonald of the health department. The recommendations deal with administrative responsibilities, oper- ating procedures, personnel and area monitoring, safety engineering, and special requirements for research installations. The primary proposals in the recommendations are (a) a radiation protection supervisor be designated, (b) the equipment be made safer either by complete en- closure of the primary X-ray beam or a system of interlocks to prevent radiation exposure of employees, and (c) the machines be monitored with appropriate survey instruments to detect radiation leakage. Nuclear Medicine Strives For 1311 Dose Reduction From the beginning, the nuclear medicine field has been commendably "dose conscious" in its use of radio- nuclides. Minimal doses neces- sary to obtain valid information are used, stated Dr. Henry N. Wellman, Bureau of Radiological Health, Pub- lic Health Seirvice. The high-dose radionuclides, such as iiiercury- 203, that were formerly used have been abandoned in favor of the use of lower dose radionuclides such as mercury-197 or, more recently, tech- netium-99m. The use of short-lived radionuelides plus advanced instru- mentation has reduced considerably absorbed doses and markedly im- provecd resulting information. The majority of procedures, and thus the bulk of the absorbed dose, in nuclear medicine still involves the use of iodine-131, especially for thyroid studies, Wellman repoirted. The Bureau has actively pursued a research and development program to make production and use of io- dine-123 practicable and economical, he continued. Iodine-123 is probably the most ideal radioisotope of iodine with an optimum half-life and with a pure gamma photon emission. The Bureau has developed a generator system that uses cyclotron-produced xenon- 123, for subsequent decay to iodine- 123, according to Wellman. The system promises to be a means of making iodine-123 readily avail- able. Use of iodine-123 instead of iodine-131 will reduce the dose by a factor of 100. In addition, iodine-123 used with a special thyroid uptake system developed by the Bureau can result in a dose reduction by a factor of 10,000. Dose assessment also has been of continuing concern to nuclear medi- cine. The Society of Nuclear Medi- cine, under a contract with the Bureau of Radiological Health, has formed the Medical Internal Radi- ation Dose Committee to provide the best data on absorbed doses from radiopharmaceuticals. The Bureau is conducting further pro- grams, especially long term profile- scan-whole-body counting, to assess the biological behavior of radio- pharmaceuticals, Wellman reported. Standards for Control of Public Radiation Exposure The identification of health pro- tection criteria, based on observed dose effects relationships, continues to Le one of the most pressing prob- lems in developing meaningful guidelines and standards for the control of the public's radiation ex- posure, stated Donald L. Snow, Bureau of Radiological Health, Pub- lic Health Service. In the absence of such criteria, experience-based standa-rds, directed toward the con- trol of equipment, techniques, and required levels /of radiation workers' technological training have tradi- tionally supplied these deficiencies. Advances in nuclear, other ioniz- ing, and nonionizing radiation tech- nologies as they are being applied and projected to a variety of con- sumer products, are foircing radia- tion protection personnel to review their present standards' guidance for adequacy in resolving problems arising from existing and emerging sources of radiation exposure. Standards must be unambiguous, and a reproducible means of meas- 222 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="35">urement must be available to insure that each standard is being met, Snow said. If ionizing radiation, is involved, emission standards for electronic products must be devel- oped with knowledge of the prob- abilities of cumulative radiation risks to individuals or a population group from a variety of radiation sources. Four broad categories of neeids for present standards for controlling radiation exposure of the public are, according to Snow: (a) new or more exact risk criteria in order to define or more precisely establish somatic or genetic damage rela- tionships, (b) further guidance on setting regulato:ry standards for ionizing radiation, (c) additional instrumentation, d a ta collection methodology, and procedures to aissess radiatioin emissions from electronic products, and (d) per- formance standards for electronic and other consumer products. Mental Health Intolerant Society Blamed For Alienation of Youth Why are children in the suburbs growing up alienated from the Ameri- can way of life? Dr. Victor Eisner said that the fault is not in the children, nor for the most part in their struggling and bewildered par- ents. The fault is in our intolerant society. The intolerance now centers in the all-white suburbs in which the pop- ulation is homogeneous. The intoler- ance is not only racial but extends to almost ajny deviation from the norm. The boundaries of the American way of life have become so narrow that we have excluded our own children, Eisner maintained. The barrier we have set up be- tween adults and adolescents has three component parts: segregation by age, institutionalized social life, and a lack of alternate pathways to success. The barrier to participation in adult life is the major cause of alienation of middle-class youth, he declared. Like the lower-class Negro adolescents, the middle-class white adolescent is isolated from the adult role models whom our culture con- siders most appropriate. The Negro, who is allowed more freedom, finds his role models in the pool halls and streets. The suburban white boy may find his in literature, on television, in his school, or elsewhere, but (again like the Negro) his role model cannot be a man at work because the boy is not allowed to enter the world of work. Both Negro and white adoles- cents try out various roles among theiir contemporaries, said Eisner, but the suburban white boy's isola- tion from adults makes him espe- cially prone to develop his own cul- ture rather than to conform to the culture around him as the Negro can. Thus, both Negroes and suburban adolescents, excluded from a world they want to enter and isolated from appropriate role models, become alienated and eventually reject the very world they had tried to enter. The Negro rejects the white world, and the suburban adolescent rejects the adult world. The economic and social consequences differ, but the psychological situation is similar. Our restrictions on adolescents are seen not only in delinquency statis- tics but in the development of "youth cultures," he pointed out. The best answer is not to punisih rebellious youth but to find a place for them in the conventional world where they can achieve a measiure of self-fulfill- ment. We must devise mechanisms whereby youth can make its options known to adults, allow adolescents the opportunity to make their own decisions on matters that affect them, even allow them the option of making decisions which we do not like, Eis- ner urged. We need mechanisms for entering adult life (similar to an ap- prenticeship system) which can serve as alternatives to conventional education. Alienation of middle-class youth would not disappear if we allowed teenagers to participate in adult ac- tivities and if we provided an alter- native pathway to a working life. But these steps would remove much of the pressure which is driving our children into nonconformity, he pre- dicted. We must start the task olf devising new patterns of life which will bring adolescents, as well as Negroes and other excluded groups, into the mainstream of American culture, said Elisner. Nurses Provide Counseling Without Traditional Team By using the principle of parsi- mony-"the best care for the most with the least by the fewest"-Dr. Leonard T. Maholick and Josephine Graham, registered nurse, of the Bradley Center, Inc., Columbus, Ga., reported that a broad spectrum of helping services can be delivered to troubled people without the full-time presence of the traditional mental health team. Services are given by an on-the-scene nurse counselor at the local health department and an outside consultant. A group of six public health nurses have been doing this system- atically since 1964, they reported. In 1967, devoting one-fourth of their time to mental health work, they con- ducted 7,800 counseling interviews with patients and their families plus 1,000 patient contacts in 175 group counseling sessions. The nurses han- dled 245 new and reopened cases in 1967 and maintained an average monthly caseload of 303. Less than $24 per patient was spent for the services of consulting psychiatrists 3 days a month and a psychologist 2 days a month. The authors gave the case history of a 28-year-old beautician who at- tempted suicide becausle of family troubles. She lives in a rural com- munity 100 miles from any psychi- atric resources. The small general hospital did not admit psychiatric cases, the family could not afford a private hospital, and t'he husband op- posed commitment to a State insti- tution. A compromise was reached: home care and a trial of counseling at the personal problem center of the local health department. Over 14 weeks, the treatment in- cluded: an intake interview; four 30-minute interviews with the nurse; Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 223</page><page sequence="36">1 hour with the psychiatrist for evaluation; six individual counsel- ing sessions with the nlurse; another psychiatrist appointment for half an hour; 6 hours of group counseling weekly; a 20-minute appointment with the psychiatrist; 6 hours of group activities weekly; and then a 30-minute interview with the p,sy- chiatrist for possible termination and aftercare. The patient was much improved and began to resume her work as a beautician. Nine months after the suicide at- tempt, the patient returnecd for a short visit with the nurse. The level of improvement was being main- tained without medication. The nurse scheduled a 10-minute appoint- ment with the psychiatrist for re- evaluation. His recommendation was discharge to care of general practi- tioner, condition improved, and further care not indicated. Psychiatric Consultation For Local Welfare Center The collaborative development of a psychiatric consultation and mental health education program for a local welfare center with a staff of 250 in New York City was described by Dr. Florence Liben of the Division of Community and Social Psychia- try and the Department of Psychia- try, Columbia Uiniversity. Cooperating agencies included the New York City Community Mental Health Board, the city welfare de- partment, the New York State Psy- chiatric Institute, and Columbia's Di- vision of Community and Social Psychiatry. The program, begun in 1965, was under the supervision of Liben. Monthly institutes were held to provide inservice training for wel- fare department caseworkers, many of whom were recent college gradu- ates. Through case presentations, they were helped to gain understand- ing and skill in dealing with welfare clients, she said. The program also provided training experience in con- sultation for residents in psychiatry and for fellows in a training program in community and social psychiatry. Liben also described how the con- sultation program was started, the techniques used to deal with initial hostility and resistance of the case- workers, and how the value of other than traditional approaches to men- tal health education and consultation was demolnstrated. The welfare agency has requested that the program be continued and expanded, she said. Psychiatric Day Hospital Or Outpatient Clinic? Long-range effects of treatment of mental patients at outpatient clinics and at psychiatric day hospitals were compared by Gerard E. Ho- garty, Friends of Psychiatric Re- search, Inc., Baltimore, and co- workers. The study compared outcomes of programs at two community facili- ties employing different treatments: drugs alone, prescribed ait the Springfield Hospital Outpatient Clin- ic, and drugs plus social psychiatric (milieu) therapy provided iat the Baltimore Psychiatric Day Center. One hundred and thirty-seven pa- tients accepted for treatment at the day hospital, and judged to be other- wise in need of inpatient care, were randomly assigned to treatment in either the day hospital or the out- patient clinic. Patients were evalu- ated at intake, at termination of treatment, at 2 months, and at 12 months following treatment by a team of independent assessors; psy- chiatrists, psychologists, and social workers. Thirty-three patients were dropped as early terminators, the authors reported. For the 104 pa- tients finishing a period of treatment, 72 sets of social work evaluations were collected at 2 months and 80 sets of data at 12 months. One trend iobserved was that non- schizophrenics, regardless of treat- ment facility, seemed not only to be more improved at the 2-month and 12-month followups, but also showed increments of improvement over time, the authors said. Schizophrenic patients, particularly those treated at the day hospital who do not con- tinue in aftercare, show marked deterioration. However, the specific type of improvement among day hospital schizophrenics observed earlier at termination is maintained anid enhanced when the schizo- phrenic patient continues in after- care. The data showed that community mental health facilities must deal with the "chronicity" of their own psychotic populations; !otherwise the strategy and success of community- based treatment becomes effectively undone without a provision for aftercare. The authors believe that the investment made in treating the schizophrenic patient in the State hospital or in the community is best protected by providing aftercare. Nonschizophrenics responded im- mediately to treatment in the com- munity and showed improvement in behavior and adjustment over time. No specific advantage for the more elaborate day hospital treatment or its intensive aftercare can be identi- fied for the nonschizophrenic. If any- thing, aftercare in the day hospital might impede progress for the non- schizophrenic. A judicious use of outpatient chemotherapy appears to be less expensive and equally ad- vantageous, according to the auth-ors. The level of social restoration achieved by a large number of pa- tients trealted in the community Hogarty and co-workers saw as im- pressive, appearing equal to if not superior to the adjustment achieved by patients folloowing traditional inpatient hospitalization. 30 Vermont Nurses Trained As Crisis Counselors Thirty nurses in Addison and Rut- land Counties, Vt., have been re- cruited and trained as community crisis counselors and are function- ing as auxiliary part-time staff of their county mental health services. They make case referrals, collect in- formation, make home visits, and help bridge the gap between the men- tal health service and the individual client. The project was described by Dr. Hans Huessy, department of psy- chiatry, University of Vermont Col- lege of Medicine, Burlington, and co- workers. They reported on the proj- ect's first year of operation. It will be continued for 2 more years and will include Bennington County. A basic hypothesis is that in rural Vermont certain community mem- 224 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="37">bers-usually physicians, clergymen, and nurses-are understood to be crisis interveners. Friends and neigh- bors turn to them in a crisis. Thus an approach to obtaining auxiliary mental health workers would be to use this natural community crisis- handling process, and to identify, re- cruit, educate, and train some of the indigenous crisis handlers. The project was designed to iden- tify registered nurses who were al- ready functioning as crisis inter- veners in their communities and to increase their skills and functioning through additional education, train- ing, and resources for their use, the authors explained. The 30 nurses were identified through letters to clergymen, hospi- tal administrators, overseers of the poor, social welfare workers, law- yers, and physicians. All nurses invited expressed interest in partici- pating, and there have been no drop- outs. Weekly seminars were held from January through June. The curricu- lum was focused on the realistic practical level of how to help a per- son in a crisis or with a mental or emotional disturbance. There was no effort to make the nurse a "junior psychiatrist," the authors stated. Half of the time at each seminar was devoted to supportive discussions with the nurses about cases they were currently carrying. The training stressed active in- volvement with people, at the same time developing an ability to recog- nize the limitations of the crisis counselor role, including awareness of individual needs to act as a nat- ural intervener, and the importance of waiting for a crisis to develop. Discussions during the seminars made it clear the nurses were deal- ing with problems involving family counseling, child behavior, overt psychosis, and a small number of suicidal crises. Education and training is continu- ing for nurses functioning as crisis counselors, said Huessy and co-work- ers. Each group meets monthly for consultatio;n with staff of the project and the local community mental health service. Each nurse maintains a case record of problems and crises handled, action taken, and type of resolution of the crisis. The records are used in evaluation of the project. Preliminary results indicate that the 30 nurses are enthusiastic, that they have learned something about mental disorders, and that they re- ceive a large number of telephone calls. The feasibility of using nurses as crisis interveners appiears to be demonstrated, the authors concluded. Mental Health Center Lacks Advantages of Hospital Is the community mental health center concept realistic or emotional? Dr. William Blyth, director of psy- chiatric training and research and clinical director of the Mental Health Institute, Cherokee, Iowa, answered that the mental health center is un- economical, catering to only s perfi- cial or supportive,therapy, uncertain in continuum, and excessively liable to disruptive influences. He said the hospital status of a mental health institute program has advantages seldom attained in a mental health clinic. It has a high ratio of psychiatrists to patients. It has more extensive facilities-psy- chological, sociological, nursing, and laboratory. Consultative advice is always available. Disruptive influ- ences are minimized. Compoisite and consultative opinions are insured, and the isolation of a single opinion is obviated. Blyth based his statements on a statistical analysis of the pisychiatric needs of six rural counties in north- western Iowa adjacent to the Mental Health Clinic in Spencer as com- pared with the needs of six rural counties adjacent to the Mental Health Institute in Cherokee and having no mental health facilities within their boundaries. He concluded that a mental health institute has many therapeutic and economic advantages over all other forms of psychiatric facilities, pro- vided that the structuring and staff- ing are at adequate levels. There is an increased uniformity of continu- ing services as contrasted with wide variations shown by other forms of mental health services. Establishment of a mental health center creates an increased demand for psychiatric services (present but not sufficiently recognized), and a part of this increased demand is passed on to the mental health insti- tute and not dealt with at the local level. The center cannot deal as ade- quately as the institute with patients requiring hospitalization, long term patients, and patients with acute social problems. Blyth mentioned certain paradoxes in the community mental health con- cept that emerged from the study. He suggested that attention there- fore should be directed to the need for reevaluating State mental hospi- tal programs either for expansion or for inclusion in community mental health planning. Hospital programs should not be rejected from further consideration until there is more cer- tainty than now exists that what will replace the State hospital programs will be superior to what is being discarded. Need Sophisticated Controls To Detect Suicidal Drivers Suicide prevention centers and al- coholic detoxification programs should become the interest and prov- ince of highway and judicial depart- ments as well as public health departments, acciording to Dr. Robert C. Eelkema, University of North Dakota School of Medicine, and co-authors. They recommended that accident control programs designed to reduce death and disability on t.he highways discontinue use of shotgun measures or across-the-board measures. So- phisticated programs must be devel- oped, not only punitive in nature for those who are sensitive to punitive measures, but therapeutic and also preventive measures for persons who are immune to punishment. Starting in 1965, Eelkema and co- authors analyzed the accident and violation rates of 238 persons who had been discharged from James- town Mental Hospital in North Da- kota in 1960. The dischargees were matched by age, sex, and county with 290 comparison subjects from records chosen ait random by the Safety Re- sponsibility Division of the North Dakota State Highway Department. Data for each person were put on Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 225</page><page sequence="38">punchcards, and the driving records of the two groups were analyzed and compared for periods before and after 1960. Major conclusions from the study follow: * Mental hospital dischargees as a group have a higher accident and vi- olation rate per 100 driver-years than the con,trol group. * Psychotics *and psychoneurotics tend to have better records than their matched comparison group after discharge. o Alcoholics show some improve- ment in accident and violation rates after discharge in relation to their matched comparison group. * Repeated punitive measures for alcoholics and those with personality disorders have little effect on acci- dents or violations or both. These drivers are "punitive immune." * Single-car accidents were almost all among those who had been hospi- talized. A significant number of per- sons involved in single-ear accidents are suicidal, compared to persons, not involved in single-car accidents who have been hospitalized in mental hlos- pitals. The survivor of the single-car accident may be trying to tell us something, but we are not listening. * Violations related to alcohol and single-car accidents could better be used as early detection mechanisms to identify the mentally disturbed, high-risk driver. Cancer Risk of Leukemia Greater In Some Ethnic Groups Adult Jews and adults born in Russia had significantly elevaited risks of leukemia, according to a study by Dr. Saxon Graham, depart- ments of sociology and preventive medicine, State University of New York at Buffalo, and co-workers. The researchers examined data on all leukemia patients reported from 1959 to 1962 in New York State (exclusive of New York City) and patients in special registries in Maryland and Minnesota. The con- trols consisted of a random sample of the same populations from which the patients were drawn. Trained interviewers visited the homes of both patients and controls to ascertain medical history and other data. Previous radiation ex- perience was obtained from records of physicians, dentists, and hos- pitals. The records showed about twice as great a radiation experience as that reported by the subjects, the authors said. Graham and co-workers found no differences by ethnic or religious background of patients or their par- ents in the occurrence of leukemia between 319 children under 15 years and the 884 control children. Data on 1,258 adults with leukemia were compared with data for 1,223 controls in the same age groups. The risk among Jews was 2.4 times that of non-Jews, and the risk among for- eign born was 1.4 times that of the native born. Investigation of differences be- tween the case and control groupis by individual European country of birth showed differences only for the Russian born. The Russian born had 2.93 times the risk of other foreign born and 3.81 times that of native- born persons. Russian Jews had a risk 5.29 timeis that of United States born non-Jews w'hose parents were born in countries other than those of Eastern Europe. The researchers also found that Jews born in the United States had a higher risk of leukemia than those of other religious groups. The distri- bution of leukemia by histologic type did not differ among Jews compared with non-Jews, nor was there any great difference in histologic type among the various foreign-born eth- nic groups. Moreover, there was no evidence that the high Russian-Jew- ish risk was related to more irradia- tion in the histories of this ethnic group. Indeed, there appeared to be an excess Russian-Jewish risk among persons with no irradiation in their histories. The authors found no convincing evidence that Jews of non-Eastern European background had higher risks than other populations. It was also apparent, they said, that non- Jews of Russian background had no excess risk. However, it was rather clear that Russian Jews had a risk even higher than those of Russians in general or of Jews in general. The Russian-Jewish risk was 5.3 times that of U.S. born non-Jews of non- Eastern European parentage, but only 3.9 times that of foreign-born non-Jews. Rates Differ By Religions In Lung Cancer Mortality Their cigarette s;moking habits ac- counted for the low death rate for lung cancer among Jewish males compared with rates for other males among residents of one sector of Montreal, concluded Dr. Isadore Horoxvitz, McGill University Faculty of Medicine, and Dr. Philip E. Enter- line, TJniversity of Pittsburgh Grad- uate School of Public Health. However, they also concluded that the high rate of lung cancer deaths amoing Jewish women and among men of British descent from the same sector could not be explained by cigarette smoking habits. Horowitz and Enterline traced the hospital and pathological records for all 1956-66 death certificates list- ing lung cancer as the underlying cause for residents of an economi- cally homogenous area (28 census tracts) in the city. The population was approximately one-third Jewish, one-third Catholic, and one-third other religions. Certificates were classified by ce,ll type of cancer and religion and ethnic origin of the de- ceased. The 1961 census of Canada provided the population denomina- tors for computing death rates. Data on the smoking habits of residents of the 28-tract area came from household interviews of a 2 percent random sample of the dwell- ing units (approximately 1,660 per- sons), the authors explained. The relatively low rate for Jewish men and the relatively high rate for Jewish women compared with their Protestant and Catholic counter- parts were striking, the authors said (see table). Comparison of the rates for lung cancer deaths among ethnic groups showed an unusually low ratio of male-to-female deaths among the Jewish. 226 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="39">Lung cancer death rates per 100,000 population among religious and ethnic groups, Montreal, 1956-66 Males Females Ratio of male-to- Mean Mean female Group Number annual Number annual age- of lung age- of lung age- adjusted cancer adjusted cancer adjusted death deaths death deaths death rates rates 1 rates1 Religious- 285 -76 Catholic 109 36. 0 18 5. 0 7. 2 Protestant 73 32. 4 18 6. 6 5. 1 Jewish 93 21. 5 40 9. 2 2. 3 Other- 10 13. 9 0 Ethnic -285 -76 French 46 27. 8 11 5. 5 5. 1 British -101 41. 1 19 5. 5 7. 5 Jewish 79 22. 0 35 9. 7 2. 3 Other -59 26. 4 11 5. 8 4. 6 1 Adjusted to the 1961 census population of the City of Montreal. Among male's of British descent the rate was highest, 41.1 per 100,000 (see table). Comparison of mortality by religious and ethnic groups suggests that this high rate may be the result of an extremely high rate among Catholic males of British descent. Because the relationship between epidermoid lung cancer and cig- arette smoking is much stronger than between glandular or terminal bronchiolar lung cancer and smok- ing, the authors examined histolog- ical types of cancer among the religious and ethnic groups. The proportion of epidermoid and anaplastic carcinomas was low for Jewish men relative to other men, suggesting that the low lung cancer death rate among the Jewish men might be due to a low rate of cig- arette smoking. Data on those who died of lung cancer and data from the household survey in the area support this statement. More Jewish men in both groups were nonsmokers, and the smokers among them smoked fewer cigarettes per day than men of the other reli- gious and ethnic groups. The study also showed, said the authors, that among Jewish women who died of lung cancer, the propor- tion who had epidermoid and ana- plastic carcinomas and the propor- tion who smoked was not in excess of that found for other females. This information suggests, they said, that cigarette smoking may not be the reason for the high death rate of Jewish women. The authors also noted that among the general popu- lation in this area of Montreal, the proportion of nonsmokers was high- est and the proportion of current smokers was lowest among Jewish wornen, relative to women of other religious and ethnic groups. As with Jewish women, the evi- dence for the hiistological types of lung cancer seen in men of British descent and their smoking habits in the population suggests that ciga- rette smoking may not be the reason for the high rate of deaths from lung cancer in this group, the authors postulated. Sunlight, Sex, and Site Factors in Melanoma? An ass,ociation of malignant melanoma, specific for some siteis, with reproductive life was poistu- lated by Dr. John A. H. Lee, depart- ment of preventive medicine, Univer- sity of Washington, who presented data on death rates from this cause in England and Wales for the 1958- 66 period. Death rates from melanomas of the lower limb were high in women: the female-to-male ratio rose with age to a maximum of 3.67 at ages 40-44, reaching a peak of 82.7 per 10 million per year at ages 40-44, then declining to 53.1 at agels 60-64 before rising progressively into old age. At ages 40-44, the ratio of female-to-male death rates was 3.32. Exposure to'sunlight cannot alone account for the change, since hem- lines do not drop much with increas- ing age, and short skirts have been fashionable for so long that a c,ohort effect is unlikely, he declared. If there is an association with repro- ductive life, it must be site specific, he suggested, since rates for mela- nomas of the face in women are not high in premenopausal age groups. Lee also found evidence in the British data that sunlight can cause melanomas of exposed skin. The rates for the exposed ears of men were much higher than the usually covered ears of women, and the death rates rose much more with age for melanomas of exposed than un- exposed siteis. He noted that high incidence and death rates for melanomas were found among white populations in tropical Queensland, but there was no concentration among sites ex- posed to sunlight. The Australian workers, he slaid, had postulated an hormonal effect. Value of Oral Cytology In Diagnosis Confirmed The value of oral cytology as an adjunct to cancer diagnosis wais first reported in 1949 by Dr. Lewis F. Morrison. Dr. Richard L. Hayes, Gordon W. Berg, and Dr. William L. Ross, Cancer Control Program, Health Services and Mental Health Adininistration, Public Health Serv- ice, examined research findings since 1949 to determine how well Morrison's conclusions have with- stood the test of time and what cor- rections, if any, are required. The seven points in Morrison's summary of his findings, set in italic type, are followed by the comments of Hayes and co-workers. 1. The results obtained by the smear technique are excellent. Data show that the use of oral cytology will result in the diagnosis of a sig- nificant number of oral cancers in lesions for which cancer is not sus- pected and that oral cytology will be positive in a significant number of Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 227</page><page sequence="40">suspected cancers for which the ini- tial biopsy was falsely negative. 2. It is not a substitute for bi- opsy. The data indicate that, for confirmed cancers, cytology will not always be positive. 3. It is an excellent adjunct to the diagnosis of exfoliating neoplasms and has shown itself to be so reliable that a positive smear demands the finding of the source of malignant cells. The data of Sandler, Umiker, and Hutter confirm this statement. 4. A knowledge of the normal cytology of the area is a prerequisite that cannot be evaded. 5. It is a time-consuming pro- cedure that demands meticulous at- tention to detail. That is one reason why it will not become a routine laboratory procedure on a level with blood counts and urinalysis. 6. Accurate diagnosis can only be made by a cytologist familiar with the area. A well-trained technician can be used to screen out unquestion- ably negative slides. 7. The method has nothing to offer the casual observer. Hayes and co-authors found sup- port for Morrison's points 4 through 7, in general, in the recent Joint Position Statement on Or.al 'Cytology issued by a group of experts. According to the statement, "Oral cytology has been shown to be an accurate diagnostic adjunct that can be of significant value for early de- tection of oral cancer when used in an oral care program which includes a thorough oral examination, other appropriate diagniostic procedures, and patient follow up." The statement also listed these cautions for practitioners. "1. Since most early oral cancers appear innocuous, the trivial appear- ance of an abnormal area should not cause one to hesitate to use cytology. A positive smear should be followed by a biopsy. An inconclusive or suspi- eioius smear should lead to careful reevaluation of the lesion. "2. It is necessary to select a lab- oratory in which the personnel have competence in oral cytology. "3. The cytologic material must be adequate, promptly transferred to a slide, fixed immediately, and prop- erly identified. For guidance, consult the expert in the laboratory. "4. Cytology is not a substitute for biopsy. Lesions clinically suspicious of cancer should be biopsied." Hayes and co-authors reviewed the many publications on oral cytology as a cancer detection technique is- sued since Morrison's 19,49 report. Some studies examined only the problem of false negatives in sus- pected or confirmed cases of oral cancer; other investigators included data from cases in which cancer was not suspected as well as data from suspected cancer cases. A few in- vestigators reported either no infor- mation or incomplete information on clinical impressions. Case reports have been m,ade on cancers which were clinically unsuspected and de- tected only because cytology was used, and several reports have been issued on the value of cytology for followup of treated cancer patients. One investigator reported on a mouthwash technique for collecting cytologic specimens from high-risk patients. The authors also reported on their examination of these studies from several points of view: oral cytology as a technique in detection and diag- nosis of cancer, its usefulness in fol- lowup of treated cancer patients, its use in experiments with laboratory animals, and as an adjunct to the diagnosis of noninalignant mouth diseases and of dermatological dis- eases which often have oral manifes- tations. They concluded that the potential value of oral cytology is not limited to cancer detection; it may also be valuable in a variety of other diseases. Health Manpower Study of Nurses' Interest In Career Advancement Intensified and aggressive recruit- ment of student nurses from the highest and lowest social classes is a possible medium for developing nurse leaders, according to Dr. Eleanor Gray Knudson, associate dean, Uni- versity of California School of Nurs- ing, San Francisco. She described a study intended to ascertain which factors might be useful in identifying nurses most interested in assuming administrative responsibilities. In California, Knudson reported, approximately 8.5 to 13 percent of the administrative positions for nurses in local health agencies and visiting nurse associations either were vacant or had just been filled. The vacancy periods extended from 5 months to more than 2 years dur- ing 1963-64. A survey in the seven most western States showed that by 1972 about 35 percent of the public health nurses employed above staff level would retire because of age. Disinterest in promotion must be overcome within the ranks of nurs- ing, she reflected, since 98 percent of the potential recruits for admin- istrative positions are women. Most professions prefer to recruit admin- istrative personnel for their special- ty from their own ranks. The prob- lem in the nursing profession, however, is recruitment from a pool of members reluctant to become ad- ministrators. Nevertheless, she said, the fact that administrative positions are finally filled from within the ranks indicates that nurses who can be in- terested in advancing occupationally must be identified earlier and more easily. Continued evaluation of studies pertaining to women's occupational aspirations led to consideration of social class origins as a significant factor in forming attitudes and values leading to interest in pro- fessional advancement. Design of the Study The 40 percent sample included 217 nurses in 13 local offlcial public health agencies representative of all such agencies in a greater metropol- itan area and adjacent hard-to-re- cruit areas in northern California. Situational realities chose-n for study related to women's role as homemiiaker-worker and included re- sponsibility for the physical care of other persons outside work when physical care entailed housekeeping 228 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="41">duties, financial responsibility for others, and willingness to relocate to secure a promotion. Marital status was included also because another investigator had found that the great majority of the relatively few advanced positions were held by single women. Education was considered an im- portant variable inasmuch as other studies had shown that educational attainment istrongly influenced job opportunities and possibilities of advancement for women. Age was included because amount of experi- ence and number of years remain- ing for work were assumed to be important conditioning factors in developing interest in occupational advancement. Finally, availability of opportunity was found to be a prom- inent factor affecting level of aspiration. Findings The profile of nurses interested in occupational advancement contains indicators which might be used in screening interviews for admission to schools of nursing and public health or in employment interviews, Knudson reported. Typically, ambitious nurses came from homes where mothers empha- sized higher education and where the mothers expected long term career orientation. The mothers' expectations were more highly mo- tivating for nurses from the lowest social class. Contrary to expectations, propor- tionately as many nurses from the lowest social class registered inter- est in becoming supervisors and ad- ministrators, as did those from the highest class. Among nurses in the intervening three classes, interest declined by class level. The lowest class group has the least financial opportunity for high- er education and probably the least exposure to persons; outside the family who would encourage them to seek higher education, Knudson stated. If they have higher educa- tion, they appear to be a highly mo,tivated group. The single nurse is regarded by many as a better risk for "career material," Knudson said. Nurses in- terested in advancement usually had a bachelor's degree, were mar- ried, between 30 and 49 years old, focused on career expectancies, viewed promotional chances in nearby agencies as favorable, and judged their financial responsibili- ties as light. Implications for Practice More emphasis might well be placed on recruiting and training nurses with home responsibilities and those in their middle years of worklife. She observed that little has been developed to meet the educational needs of the worker who is inter- ested in advancement but must maintain her marriage. Employing agencies frequently grant time off for course work but no correspond- ing cut in workload. Among nurses not int-erested in advancing, more than four-fifths disliked supervisory or administra- tive functions. Do the job functions require redefinition, Knudson asked, or is the image as perceived by nurses in subordinate positions based on lack of knowledge or misconceptions? Methods for reaching girls in the lowest class group, influencing them, and assisting them financially to ob- tain higher education need to be de- veloped. Girls and their parents from the highest social class should be informed that nursing is chang- ing and no longer akin to domestic servitude, Knudson suggested. Urban Poor Get Toehold On Health Careers Ladder The "new careers" approach to the critical shortage of health manpower focuses on the reassignment of func- tions within specific health occupa- tions, introduction of new services, increased emphasis on existing func- tions, land restructuring the health careers ladder hierarchy in the in- terest of career mobility. Dr. Sheldon S. Steinberg, director of the New Careers Training Pro- gram at Howard University, and co- authors presented the following hypotheses of the new careers train- ing model: (a) a realistic pattern of upward career mobility, which is linked to entry-level jobs, can be created in health and health-related occupations, (b) people with differ- ent social, economic, and educational backgrounds can be recruited for these jobs and helped to stay in them, (c) this involvement will im- prove the social, personal, and psy- chological behavior of the trainees, (d) career ladders can be developed from entry level to professional level, and (e) with continuing train- ing, education, and support, entry- level workers can use the career lad- der for upward and diagonal mobility. A critical facet of career mobility is attracting untapped health man- power, particularly the disadvan- taged in urban ghettoes, and training these people for entry-level jobs, according to the authors. They believe that cores of information and work experience should be provided in advance to enable the poor to achieve easy linkage with the lower rungs of the ladder. The training model provides the linkage between the poor who have not graduated from high school and the traditional entry-level require- ment of a high school diploma. Here- tofore, the authors pointed out, this linkage was provided only in on-the- job training of aides and orderlies in hospitals. Job development is the foundation of any program to prepare workers at any level, and trainees must have assurance from the beginning that their training is related to specific and concrete employment, the au- thors stated. The training process for entry-level linkage positions should be a combination of didactic material and immediate on-the-job training. During this process, the authors went on, the recruited train- ees should be made aware of options for both horizontal and vertical career mobility after their training period. A health careers ladder is feasible if well-planned training and educa- tional models are developed in logi- cal sequences to enable people to move from the lowest rung through the various levels of increasing re- sponsibility and training. Provision must be made by educational and health service institutions to apply academic credit or experience equiv- Vol. 84. No. 3, March 1969 229</page><page sequence="42">aleince to requirements for the next level of the ladder, the authors stated. The authors cited several examples of how the new careers approach has been used in health service agencies. In California, home health aides from public and private nonprofit agencies provide direct services for chronically ill, geriatric, and handi- capped patients. In the District of Columbia, a variety of "human serv- ice aides" have been trained in health work, including mental health, and assigned to public agencies. Pittsburgh and New York City also have neighborhood or com- munity health aides who have been trained in carefully planned and supervised programs. These aides receive comprehensive on-the-job ex- perience. In most cases, the authors stated, remedial education parallels the training program. The early ex- periences reported by the agencies employing new careerists have dem- onstrated that this concept is viable and realistic. Health Aides Need Training In Communications Skills Although communication is an important skill for health aides, many aides reported problems in communicating and relating to both staff and clients, and only three of 12 projects in a nationwide study trained aides in interpersonal, hu- man relations and communications skills. This revelation was among the findings of Dr Wilbur Hoff, Insti- tute for Research, Oakland, Calif., who coinducted a 1-year study on a contract from the Migrant Health Branch, Public Health Service. Its objective was to document and as- sess the experiences of local migrant health projects using health aides and to develop guidelines to increase the aides' effectiveness. Method of Study Health aides were employed in migrant programs and performed activities in community health ed- ucation, nursing, sanitation, family planning, tuberculosis, and venereal disease control. The basic sample for the study was draxvn from all migrant health projects which had employed aides 3 years or longer. These projects were in North Caro- lina, Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Min- nesota, Kansas, Texas, Oregon, and California. Of the 84 aides in the survey, 10 nursing or clinic aides, nine sanita- tion aides, and 47 community health education aides were inteirviewed. Also interviewed were 57 profes- sional personnel: each aide's super- visor and the project director, nurse, sanitarian, health educator, social worker, or any two or more of these personnel. In addition to the basic sample group, interviews were held with professionals in Arizona, Michigan, and New York. Although these States had active migrant health projects, they either had not em- ployed health aides in their state- wide programs or had begun to do so only within the study year. Behavioral data regarding the aides were obtained from aides' rec- ords of exactly what they did on 3 representative days, comparing the aides' and the professionals' perceptions of the aides' jobs, and having each aide rated by the su- pervisor. The rating form consisted of 10 items and attitudes which could be marked on a 4-point scale of below average, average, above av- erage, or excellent. Findings All of the aides were rated as av- erage, above average, or excellent in performance despite significant differences between what they were actually doing and what the profes- sionals perceived them as doing. The overall effect of the aides on the health agencies was perceived as fa- vorable in all the projects. Staff felt that health services to migrants could be extended and im- proved and that aides could do case- finding, educate migrants in better health practices, work in clinics, and interpret. The duties entailed overcoming sociocultural barriers between the staff and migrants, and motivating hard-to-reach migrants, Hoff observed. Twenty (24 percent) of the 84 aides were nursing-clinic aides who assisted in the office, clinic, or home; 10 (12 percent) were sanitation aides who assisted with environmen- tal health duties in labor camps, housing units, and fields; anld 54 (64 percent) were community health aides who participated in educa- tional activities with individuals, families, or groups. Only 12 were men; nine were sanitation aides, and three were community health aides. Hoff saw the scarcity of men as community health aides as a serious deficiency if health services are to be provided more effectively to males. Low salaries, the part-time or tem- porary nature of the positions, and the unwillingness or inability of pro- fessionals to see these positions as a legitimate endeavor for men are among the reasons more men are not used. The ethnic backgrounds of the aides generally matched the people with whom they worked, he noted. Sixty-one piercent were of Mexican descent, 21 percent were Negroes, 17 percent were Anglo-Americans, and one was Filipino. With one excep- tion, all the aides spoke the language of the group with whom they worked. Twenty-one (32 percent) of the aides had less than high school edu- cations, Hoff commented, and most of these were working in the western projects. The western projects hired more indigenous aides whose educa- tional backgrounds were closer to the migrants. Eastern projects employed more college students. Organized training varied from none to 12 weeks, and the training period did not appear related to the educational level of the aides or their jobs. Only six projects supplied a written statement of objectives, and, Hoff revealed, these objectives did nlot comply with the standard criteria. Of the seven projects which had evaluated aides' training, four had documented the results. Five projects had sitaff with formal edu- cation or training in planning, con- ducting, and evaluating training pro- grams. Hoff recalled that the two most effective training programs were conducted by health educators. Health agencies do not regard aides as full-fledged members of the health team, Hoff stated. Many aides have temporary or part-time jobs, receive lo,w pay, and get iio social 230 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="43">security, paid vacation, sick leave, health insurance, or other beneifits. Aides pay ranged from $1.25 to $3.05 per hour, and at the time of the study there were no opportuni- ties for advancement in a health career. Most aides interviewed ex- pressed great satisfaction with the work they were doing, but many re- sented not having the same job rights as professionals. As long as substand- ard employment conditions exist for health aides, Hoff warned, health professionals will continue to train aides and auxiliaries who accept bet- ter-paid employment elsewhere. Two-Year Program Increases Professional Sanitarians The 2-year associate degree is an excellent recruitment tool for pro- fessional sanitarians because a ma- jority of the students eventually complete the baccalaureate program, according to John R. Fleming, of Ferris State (Mich.) College. The two best sources of recruitment for the associate degree program for sanitarians, he explained, are the local health department worker and fellow students. Ten of 27 students in the environmental health orien- tation class identify members in the public health team as a principal source of recruitment, Fleming said, and students in the program en- counter other students seeking a vocational goal which will comple- ment their science-oriented interests. The 2-Year Program In searching for a college-based solution to the shortage of sanitation personnel about 14 years ago, Flem- ing recalled, a group of nonpublic health educators challenged the con- cept that 4 years of college training was required to develop a capable sanitarian. The educators proposed training a skilled technician who, after 2 years of academic prepara- tion, could work competently under the direction of a professional sani- tarian and relieve him of the techni- cal duties which frustrate and retard his professional aspirations and ef- fectiveness. On this concept, Ferris' environmental sanitarian assistant program was launched. Students in the 2-yelar educational program study general environmen- tal techniques and practices, food and milk sanitation, food preservation and meat technology, water supply and sewage disposal, parasitology and entomology, microbiology, draft- ing and plan reading, basic sciences, social sciences, communications courses, and political sciencies. They also spend a 6-week internship with a local health department. In 105 quarteir hours of study, the students are prepared to be general environ- mental health assistants to profes- sional sanitarians. Students' Prospects The major market for Ferris' sanitarian technicians, Fleming con- tinued, has been local health de- partments in Michigan. The State's water resources commission, urban renewal and air pollution programs, and the food processing industry have absorbed a few. While it ap- pears that associate degree students possess great potential for employ- ment in the quality control programs of private industry and governmental nonhealth agency programs, Ferris State College has been unable to satisfy the manpower demands of local health departments, despite graduating classes of 25 or more. The majority of students who had short term college goals before their field training experiences return di- rectly to the campus for completion of the baccalaureate degree environ- mental health program, Fleming said. Others work a few years and then return. Only seven of 70 Ferris grad- uates employed in environmental health programs have not completed their B.S. degree requirements. Having both levels of sanitarians' training on the campus must have some influence on Ferris' sanitarian assistant graduates, Fleming said. Also, the draft situation probably ac- counts for the high percentage who return directly to the baccalaureate program following completion of their associate degree work. Program's Pros and Cons Fleming identified a number of advantages and weaknesses in using environmental technicians. The bene- fits iinclude (a) greater employee satisfaction where job responsibil- ities and skill levels correlate, (b) accelerating the development of skilled environmental health man- power, (c) a more business-like ex- penditure of sialaries for environ- mental health, and (d) in recruiting, the attractiveness of short term goals. The major disadvantages are (a) over-use of the sanitarian technician in the field due to failure to recog- nize the technician's limitations and abilities and (b) the lack of guid- ance and support of the profession in developing training programns and the certification of the sanitarian technician. Versatile Volunteers Exceed Expectations If there are other things the Cin- cinnati Health Department volun- teers can do, the health department has not thought of them yet, de- clared the volunteers' president, Mrs. Eugene Sterne, Jr. Sterne, a registered nurse, recalled that the volunteers' official objectives were to (a) aid the health depart- ment by releasing nurses for profes- sional duties, and (b) provide sup- plementary health and educational equipment to expand the volunteer program, and (c) interpret to the community the work of the depart- ment. Actually, she said, volunteers try to do almost anything they are asked. Services in Clinics The Cincinnati Health Depart- ment conducts 14 clinics, and volun- teers work in 20 to 2;7 sessions of the infant welfare, prenatal and post- natal, general medical, hearing, and plastic surgery clinics. Volunteers weigh and measure patients, take temperatures, make records, help nurses and physicians, and do some interviewing. The volunteers say they preceded Head Start. T'he first volunteer play- corner supervisor discovered that the childrien did not know colors, shapes, or other simple things usually taken for granted in volunteers' youngsters. Volunteers listed sug- gestions for play-corner supervisors which encouraged teaching some of this type of information. Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 231</page><page sequence="44">Projectors and filmstrips were bought by volunteers, Sterne contin- ued, and they began an educational program in the waiting rooms, a proj- ect which requires steel nerves and endless patience amidst crying or noisy children, shushing mothers, and an audience which departs one by one. In some clinics where lim- ited space precludes using a projec- tor, a seated volunteer talks to from one to five pooplo. Sho may have a flip chart or a folder as a prop. For about 2 years the volunteers visited handicapped children. At the beginning, Sterne reminisced, about 179 names of patients who were not receiving medical care were on the handicapped registry. Volunteers visited parents to persuade them to bring youngsters to the clinic, made appointments, transported children and parents to clinics, waited with their charges, and saw that many families' problems were taken care of, frequently by interesting other agencies. Operations Doorstep At least four activities entailed "getting out the people by going door to door and asking them to partici- paite." Volunteers carried babies, hung on to preschoolers, helped the aged, and literally led people by the hand to get them to take advantage of services brought to their doors. The tuberculosis testing program was planned to cover a 5-block slum area in 3 days. The X-ray unit was moved to different locations as test- ing was completed in each area. The medical skin-testing team for chil- dren worked in a tent pitched adja- cent to the tuberculosis unit just off the sidewalk or on it, if no other space was available. More than 200 volunteers worked in this program, and 1,274 persons (70 percent of those contacted) participated. The second operation was an at- tempt to get a chest X-ray and gen- eral physical examination of all the residents of a 2-block area in 2 days. The X-ray unit was parked outside a vacant store which had been con- verted to a clinic. Sixty volunteers were involved in examinations of 255 residents. For the operation which com- bined immunization with tuberculo- sis screening, the volunteers aban- doned tents and borrowved a transit company bus, Sterne said. More than 600 volunteers helped to get 4,372 persons X-rayed and 560 children immunized. During the antimeasles campaign half-day clinics were scheduled at 33 schools during a 10-day period. Door- to-door solicitation was done in each school area 3 or 4 days before the elinic giaion- Information was col- lected oin all children, and a notice of the clinic and a permit slip were given to the parent. Exclusive of PTA workers, there were 232 volun- teers; 5,293 children were immu- nized. Working in Slums The schools were most cooperative. Ministers of store-front churches were difficult to reach except at odd hours or by telephone. However, they distributed publicity. Contacting the businesses included visiting bars which Sterne said were well popu- lated at 9 a.m. and appeared never to close. The day before the drive began, two boys' clubs from the community center distributed folders. Prizes were incentives to partici- pation in the screening, Sterne noted. Because one volunteer was related to a toy manufacturer, the group re- ceived many toys which did not sell at Christmas. Another donor, owner of an interstate trucking business, contributed damaged goods not claimed by insurance companies. Plastic dishpans, cooking oil, im- ported sardines, soap powder, and candy served as lottery prizes. Everyone who was X-rayed or immu- nized got a ticket. Just before the unit closed, the lucky numbers were drawn. Subsequent Operations The volunteers have conducted surveys on the level of immunization of 1-year olds and to determine what kind of health education programs clinic patients felt they needed. In the fall of 1967 they conducted a workshop on health planning, based on the report of the President's health planning commission. In the summer of 1968 about a dozen volunteers began a visiting program for the elderly living in two high-rise housing projects. Their ob- jective, Sterne said, is to determine the health needs of the residents and establish a regular visiting program for those with health problems. The volunteers were responsible also for doing audiometries on 880 children in the Head Start program, and they checked the children's vision and took histories when needed. In the fall of 1968 the volunteers shared responsibillty for a hearing testing program with the speech and hearing department of the University of Cincinnati. All of the kindergarten children in the city were tested. The Cincinnati Health Department volunteers expect to continue their involvement in new health programs. Health Education Aides Learn Marketable Skills Aides can do more things and are more capable than we dreamed pos- sible, declared Dr. M. M. Young, di- rector, and Genevieve P. Hamlin, health educator, Chattanooga-Hamil- ton County (Tenn.) Health Depart- men;t. They described a project staffed by 23 female aides and 23 professional and clerical personnel. Training In a minimum of 6 weeks' training the health education aides became well grounded in the programs of the health department as well as in those of other public and voluntary agencies. They received instruction in the use of audiovisual aids, inter- viewing techniques, and nutrition, Young and Hamlin said. At first the aides struggled for positions of leadership, but a spirit of coopera- tion soon developed and the aides began teaching each other various skills. Types of Activities A community survey to determine what the residents considered were their health problems was one of the aides' first activities. Three points were emphasized to the aides. 1. If trouble or unpleasantness is evident, terminate the interview or leave the area. 2. The aide is never to attempt to diagnose. 232 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="45">3. The aide is never to recom- mend treatment. The aides became expert projec- tionists, and they frequently used projection equipment in their com- munity activities. With a background of correct information, they were able to italk on specializeld topics at almost any level from that of Head Start children to parents, PTA members, and others. The aides have not hesitated to engage in research necessary to find needed answers. Some accounts of the experiences of some health education aides indi- cates how they have functioned. One young woman with only a sixth grade education became one of the best organizers for community health activities in ithe entire group. After she organized a Halloween party for youngsters in her housing project, there was practically no vandalism in the project that night. She subsequently o.rganized a Thanksgiving party and dinner for elderly tenants and a Christmas party with refreshments and small gifts for adults and children. From such activities c;arryover into organizaltion for health educa- tion would be easy, she thought. When only eighit friends came to her first living room meeting to learn about family planning, she was not so sure. However, this first meeting mushroomed into others on cancer, dental care, and more on family planning. Professional staff from the health deplartment, including physi- cians, served as resource persons at isBome meetings. Opportunities for Advancement Real opportunities for advance- ment were provilded for the health education aides: three are off wel- fare, three have moved from public housing, one purchased a home, two have married and one of these is far above the poverty income level, and one is employed as a laboratory aide in the State health department branch laboratory. All the women originally em- ployed in the program have become economically independent, contribut- ing members of society and have also found job satisfaction which they had not previously enjoyed. Becausie many aides have strug- gled for years with the conditions they seek to alleviate, their ap- proaches are often quite different and no less effective than those of the so-called professionals. Grad- ually, Young and Hamlin said, the aides have sold themselves and their services to the professionals in the department. Is health education at the nonpro- fessional level a marketable !skill? Young and Hamlin asked. Not neces- sarily, although some people trained in this iskill can advance into other types iof employment. Maternal and Child Health New Haven's Special School Serves Pregnant Teenagers Integrated school and medical services for pregnant school girls at New Haven's Polly T. McCabe Cen- ter were described by Mary E. Holmes, Medical Foundation, Bos- ton, Dr. Lorraine V. Klerman, Yale University Department of Epidem- iology and Public Health, and Dr. Ira W. Gabrielson, University of California School of Public Health, Berkeley. Before the center opened in 1966, pregnant students received only 7 hours a week of instructioin in the school system's homebound pro- gram. The center holds classes 15 hours a week, with instruction par- alleling the girls' regular classroom work under the supervision of the board of education. One result has been that the majority of the giris continue in regular schools after delivery and s,everal have gone to college. The local antipoverty organiza- tioin supplies a director who assists with nonacademic problems. A nurse from the Visiting Nurse As- sociation gives heialth counseling. Medical and social servicesi are sup- plied by a special obstetrically-cen- tered comprehensive health program of Yale-New Haven Hospital. The center has reduced the stu- dent load in the board of education's homebound program. In 1965-66, 64 girls applied for homebound instruc- tion during pregnancy, in 1966-67, 98 girls applieid. During the 1967-68 school year, the average coist per pupil at the center was $338, ap- proximately the same sum spent for other students in the New Haven system. In both school years, two census tracts, one a poverty area and one a mioderate income area, had the largest percentage of applicants to the homebound program. Special schools should be only an intermediate stage in educating pregnant students, Holmes and co- authors emphasized. As arguments for keeping them in regular schools, they cited the greater flexibility and economy of the regular school over the special school. Also, keeping the girls in regular schools would indi- cate a reiduction in the social con- demnation of out-of-wedlock preg- nancy and would be a realistic step for the educational systems, they declared. Does a Chronically Ill Child Limit the Family's Size? Parents of chronically ill children continue to produce offspring at the same rate as parents of normal chil- dren, according to a study in Buffalo, N.Y., conducted by Dr. Harry A. Sultz, State Univer'sity of New York at Buffalo, and co-workers. They in- vestigated the effect of such a child on family size among 291 families matched with control mothers ac- cording to the age of the sample mother at the birth of the ill child and the child's birth order in the family. Several questions prompted Sulz and co-workers to make the investi- gation. Is the handicapped child in- cluded as part of the family's size goal or do families replace the child? Does the burden of care the child requires or the fear of producing additional unhealthy children cause families to limit further pregnancies? Twenty-five sample families had obtained family or personal counsel- ing services. Ten mothers in the group were given counseling on birth Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 233</page><page sequence="46">control. Fertility rates did decline, the authors found, for those receiv- ing family counseling services and among the 42 families with more than one child with the same chronic condition as the study child. However, only 6 percent of the 85 families having children with genet- ically determined conditions sought counseling compared with 9.7 per- cent of the 206 families in which the child had a nongenetically deter- mined condition. The authors cau- tioned that their classification of diagnoses as genetically determined and nongenetically determined was arbitrary, and many genetic coun- selors might disagree with their classification. While not all families in the sample continued to have children regardless of the presence of a chronically ill child, as a group the change in their fertility rates after awareness of the child's condition differeid little from that of control families. Fertility rates of sample mothers declined 41 percent; among the control mothers, the rate declined by 37 percent. Fertility rates of mothers of children with genetically deter- milned conditions declined more than rates of other mothers in the sample group (see chart). The ratio of births declined from 1.06 to 0.79; among mothers of children with nongenetically determined con- ditions, the ratio dropped from 1.27 to 1.24 after awareness of the child's condition, the authors reported. Many parents of chronically ill children who did not receive genetic counseling might have benefited from it, Sultz and co-workers stated. No genetic counseliing services were available in Erie County at the time Fertility rates per 1,000 person years of exposure before and after awareness among 206 families of child's nongenetically determined condition and among 85 families of child's genetically determined condition. 2 5 0.0 Before awcireness Aiter awcireness .......... .......... .............. .................

A program for children with chronic conditions is not com- plete without genetic counseling, they declared. Ghetto Center Is the Place To Give MCH Services Maternal and child health services given in a neighborhood store-front facility resulted in more adopters of birth control than prenatal services given in the traditional pattern of the Visiting Nurse Association. Nancy Milio, registered nurse, of the Detroit VNA, described two ap- proaches in an admittedly incom- plete evaluation made 10 to 20 months after the study period. Half of the sample, 51 women, at- tended the Mom and T'ots Center in a ghetto area. The center is staffed by neighborhood residents and has child day care, birth control services, transportation for patients, and group activities for women and chil- dren as well as a satellite prenatal clinic. Patients received no prenatal home visits, but were given monthly examinations at the center where group discussions *on birth control as well as other subjects were plart of the clinic sessions. They received at least one home visit within 1 week post partum, another visit or phone call at 2 months, and a third at 7 months post partum, Millo stated. Another 51 women were given care in the traditional hospital-prenatal- postnatal home visit pattern carried on according to customary proce- dure through the VNA district of- fices. Birth control was discussed with only 5X5 percent of the group, according to VNA records, said Millo. The two groups were matched by age, marital status, gravidity, and trimester in which prenatal care was begun. All 102 were medically indigent residenits of the same 11/2- square-mile area and had received their first obstetrical examination at the same hospital outpatient s-erv- ice; none had a chronic medical or obstetrical disease. In the VNA-served group only 30 of the 51 women could be located 10-20 months post partum. Of these, 57 percent said their infant was im- munized and 73 percent stated ithat they were using a birth control method. In the Mom and Tots group, 95 percent were practicing birth control. Milio concluded that a public health nurse uses her time more effectively when she works through neighborhood workers in a neighbor- hood facility to help low-income women with child spacing and well- baby care. She also men;tioned the following criticismis the public health nurses made of the evaluation: the time the nurse spends with the patient in the outpatient department of the hospi;tal was not included; nurses have too many patients to see them all on home visits; the VNA nurses do not emphasize child spacing and lack a center to supply family plan- ning materials and patient trans- portation; and the evaluation could not include intangibles given on a home visit. Special Care for High Risks Cuts Prematurity Rate A 29 percent reduction in pre,- maturity incidence occurred be- tween two time periods of the total maternal and infant care program for super-high-risk patients con- ducted by New York Medical College. Comparisons of data on a 13-month period (1966) with that for an 18- month period (1967-68) were pre- sented by Dr. Edwin M. Gold, Uni- versity of California San Francisco Medical Center, and Dr. M. L. Stone and Dr. Herbert Rich of the medical college. (Goild was formerly profes- sor of obstetrics and gynecology at the college.) Patients average 1.6 high-risk fac- tors on admission. Following are the number of major factors patients had in each time period: Factor 1966 1967-68 Pregnancy wastage-_ 283 370 Underweight - 190 124 Under 17 years 156 239 Overweight -107 242 Grand multipara - 87 164 Previous operative delivery -70 107 Hypertensive disease -74 91 Cardiovascular disease -22 52 Toxemia -21 22 Patients in the project receive hos- pital-based, integrated multidiscipli- nary services. Each one (781 in 1966, 1,160 in 1967-68) had her own obste- trician and public health nurse through prenatal, postpartum, and family planning and interconcep- tional phases of care. Each infant also had his own pediatrician and public health nurse through the first year of life. Continuous patient edu- cation stressed health care for well- ness rather than sickness, the au- thors emphasized. Volume of services ros,e from 5,430 visits in 1966 to 15,721 in 1967- 68. More than 80 percent of the pa- tients were admitted before the sev- enth month of pregnancy. Hvowever, Gold and co-workers could not ac- count for an increase, 17 percent compared with 11 percent in the earlier period, of those admitted in the third trimester of pregnancy. During the 18-month period, there were 159 antepartum hospitaliza- tions. One-half of these were for bleeding, elevated blood pressure, and diabetes, they said. Total perinatal mortality, deaths of infants under 7 days of age, and fetal deaths all decreased when data for the two periods were compared (see table). The authors attributed the 43 percent reduction in total perinatal mortality to a 29 percent Perinatal mortality, New York Medical College maternal and infant care program, by percentages Deaths 1966 1967-68 Change 28 weeks gestation or more -28. 5 17. 5 -39 Under 7 days -54. 1 30. 6 -43 Total -80. 3 47. 3 -41 Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 235</page><page sequence="48">reduction in the percent of infants born prematurely and reductions of 14 percent in deaths of infants weighing less than 2,000 gm. and of 52 percent in deaths of those weighing 2,001-2,500 gms. Gold and co-workers saw a need for greater efforts to enroll super- high-risk patients in the first trimes- ter and to cut down on the number of appointments broken (36 percent of postpartum and interconceptional visits, 38 percent of family planning visits, and 43 percent of child health visits). Mothers Under 17 Likely To Repeat Within 3 Years Early pregnancy, even more than race or socioeconomic status, was the most potent predictor of future re- productive behavior, said Dr. J. Philip Keeve and co-workers of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. They re- ported a followup study of girls un- der 17 who bore children in Alle- gheny County, Pa. The 12- to 16-year-old primiparas were followed for at least 3 years to derive fertility rates. Of 308,658 live births recorded in the county 1958- 67, a total of 3,662 occurred to girls under 17. Sixty percent of the girls had second pregnancies. They were followed to age 19 to obtain cohort rates and birth probabilities by age, race, and residence. Annual single- year-of-age populations of girls 12 to 19 years were obtained by applying race and age-specific survival rates to 1960 census data, which were then projected throughout the study pe- riod using the cohort iteration method. Total fertility rates for 12- to 16- year-olds declined during the study period at the rate of 3 percent per year, but mostly because the rate for 16-year-olds dropped from 21.2 in 1958 to 15.8 per 1,000 in 1967. Rates for the younger age groups went up, however. Tracking cohorts for 3 years, 62 percent of the 929 nonwhite girls produced 799 additioinal babies and 52 percent of 1,195 white girls de- livered 791 babies.

Socioeconomic status was re- flected by residence, with higher rates for both white and nonwhite girls in the city of Pittsburgh com- pared with those who lived in the coulnty outside the city. The authors also noted that these socioeconomic factors asserted themselves as early as 13 years among the nonwhite group and by age 15 among the white group. They found that age patterns were far more similar than race pat- terns. By age 19, both 15- and 16- year-old white cohorts exceeded a rate of 1,600 births per 1,000 females; nonwhite 16-year-olds had reached 1,800, and the nonwhite 15- year-olds, 2,300. Specific birth-order probabilities for the entire group revealed that 9 percent of the mothers with third- order births had had a fourth child 3 years after their initial pregnancy; if the trend of increasing fertility within age is held constant, the younger a girl becomes a mother, the 236 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="49">greater the chance she will have re- peated pregnancies. The authors declared that the study results provide benchmarks to gauge past and future changes o'f the juvenile fertility pattern and give a basis for evaluating attempts to reduce juvenile pregnancies in the community. They cautioned, however, that despite the anticipated decline in total fertility, the acceptance of con- traception, growth of family plan- ning services, and liberalization of abortion laws, substantial numbers of the 12- to 16-year-old mothers will have repeated pregnancies by the time they reach 19, the national mean age of primiparity. The situa- tion is not restricted to specific ethnic or socioeconomic groups. Rendering services to teenage mothers may meet an important community need, but preventing their initial pregnancies may be the most urgent course of action, they surmised. The road to this goal must be charted 'by the entire community; juvenile pregnancies are not solelly health problems. The helping profels- sions must engage in debate over the soft questions of value commitments for both youths and their parents, they urged. Child-Rearing Attitudes of Negro Teenage Girls Answers to 12 questions about child-rearing practices given by 80 unmarried primiparous Negro girls 15 to 19 years old were analyzed by Dr. Margaret Gutelius, director, Child Health Center, Children's Hospital of Washington, D.C. She described the girls as of nor- mal intelligence, without chronic physical disease or major mental pathology. All had started junior high school, and 20 percent finished high school. Eighty-five percent identified well with their own mothers; 90 percent were pleased or at least accepting of the pregnancy. Twenty percent lived with both par- ents, and their mothers were heads of the households of 50 percent. All girls expected to work outside the home. In short, Gutelius said, the girlis did not come from the hard- core families at the lowest end of the poverty continuum. The questionnaire was designed to investigate attitudes toward these child-rearing practices other re- searchers have found typical of low- income families: harsh physical methods of disciplining children; in- consistent discipline according to the parent's mood; lack of verbal cornmunication with a child; inhibi- tioni of a child's curiosity; and no commitment to the slow develop- ment of a child or his need for gradually increasing independence. The girls' responses -to a child's behavior in various situations are shown in the table. The positive an- swers are considered good responses, namely, those recommended gener- ally by pediatricians and psychia- trists and those commonly practiced in middle-class families. The answers to questions 1, 2, 3, and 7 indicated, for the majority of girls, a pattern of punitiveness in handling immature behavior, Gute- lius said. Questions 4, 8, and 10 in- volving sensitivity to the needis of a young child were well answered, she declared. The girls' responses to question 6 showed inconsistent dis- cipline in their own upbringing. Answering a question (not in the table) as to what age child they enjoy moist, half the girls liked chil- dren of all ages, a fourth preferred the older ages, and a fourth pre- ferred infants. These answers, Gutelius pointed out, did not bear out the dictum that ghetto mothers love infants but lose interest when the child is about 2 and difficult to control and that, by school age, these parents feel estranged from their children. Gutelius found disappointing the responses to question 9 (most would praise a child seldom) and question 5 (only a fourth would encourage a child to talk with adults). Also diis- appointing were replies to question 11 (what the girls could do in the early years to help the child do well later in school). They emphasized obedience, manners, and rote mem- ory learning of such things as the A, B, C's. The questionnaire will serve as a baseline for comparison with later changes in attitude and the actual practices the girls follow. The girls and their children are in a research program of well-baby care from birth to 3 years. A pediatrician and a nurse will use a mobile coach to make home visits. The study group will receive not only preventive health meaisures but advice on child rearing and assistance in providing appropriate stimulation for the in- fant, especially in developing lan- guage skills. Infant Mortality Decreased By Multiservice Project Chicago's infant and neonatal mortality rates have dropped in the 3 years that a maternity and infanit care project funded by the Chil- dren's Bureau has been in effect, stated Dr. Morgan J.

Between 1964 anid 1967 the infant mortality rate for Chicago dropped from 30.40 to 29.37' per 1,000 live births. Over the same period neo- natal mortality decreased from 21.25 to 20.20 per 1,000 live births, they reported. For nonwhite infants (90 percent of the patients the board's 18 clinics serve are Negroes from low-income areas) the mortal- ity rate went from 43.06 to 37.22 and the neonatal mortality rate from 29.00 to 25.31 per 1,000 live births over the 3 years. The outcome of pregnancy was re- viewed for all patients 15 years or younger at the time of conception. This study sihowed that for infants delivered of Negro mothers cared for in the project, the hebdomadal (under 7 days) mortality rate was 15.0 and for deaths of infants less than 28 days old, the rate was 18.2 per 1,000 live births. For Negro pa- tients receiving care elsewhere, or receiving no care, the hebdomadal rate was 33.7 and for deaths under 28 days, 42.9, according to O'Con- nell and Zackler. The project enabled the board of health to employ physicians full time, dentists, social workers, clinic nurses, health educators, and others who have served more than 78,000 pregnant women between July 1964 and June 1968 (see table). Clinics are open all day and screening tests performed included 134,517 hemo- globin electrophoresis determina- tions, 89,963 Papanicolaou smears, and 43,492 blood sugar determina- tions. The authors listed other services instituted under the project. Pre- natal patients receive care at 10 dental units located throughout the city. High-risk maternity patients are registered with associated hos- pitals for prenatal care after the seventh month of pregnancy and for delivery. Hospitals either are asso- ciated with a medical school or have an accredited residency training in obstetrics. The project pays the hos- pitals for this care. Family plan- ning clinics have been set up at 17 maternal clinics.

Occupational Health Dose-Response Experience Basis for Exposure Limits Industrial hygienists too often ac- cept uncritically a threshold value or other guide for the exposure of workers to hazardous agents without taking the time to establish that no adverse physiological response oc- curs at a p,articular exposure level. Such values are useful tools, but it is imperative, stated John A. Pender- grass, manager of industrial hygiene, 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn., that these limits be scientifically sound and viable. Exposure limits, the author ex- plained, depend upon the principle of the dose-response relationship (the magnitude of exposure to a hazard- ous agent and the degree of re- sponse in the person exposed). The dose-response experience, Pender- grass said, represents the only valid data for defining and refining ex- posure limits. But we have to de- termine what constitutes a response. Professionals in occupational health, stated the author, must insist that the controlling factor in deciding ac- ceptable levels of stress be the hazard, not the toxicity. Pendergrass sees the need for an independent body-a national coun- cil-made up of competent specialists of unquestionable integrity who will establish guides for exposure. This body would only recommend guides of good practice rather than draft model laws, since the advisability of a legal standard is questionable, he said. Another need mentioned by the author was for a central place where data from toxicity studies, analytical methods, stress measure- ment techniques, and human expe- rience could be collected for contin- ual review and analysis. These data could thein serve as a basis for the exposure guides. But such data are not easily obtained, Pendergrass emuphasized. Among the reasons that such data are lacking or sparse is that physicians in industry have not eniphasized group health and its correlation with industrial exposure to hazardous substances or con- ditions. Industrial physicians and hygienists have not worked together. If health specialists in industry do not exert pressure from within to bring about needed changes so that data will become available on which to base exposure guides, the pressure will come from outside. The Occupa- tional Safety and Health Act of 1968, Pendergrass said, is one example of outside pressure. Industry-oriented groups, such as the American Petroleum Institute, have directed a few specific studies am-ong their members on hazards, but many more should be conducted. Information is needed on the physi- ological effect of exposure to specific chemicals, the author pointed out. 238 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="51">As an example, isocyanates are widely used, and it is known that overexposure can lead to acute symiptoms as well as a unique type of sensitization. There is no bioassay for isocyanates, no way to predict which person will be most likely to develop symptoms or become seinsitized. As to silicosis, said the author, the advantages of electronic dust count- ing are just now beginning to be compared with microscopic methods of screening the environment for dust concentrations. Earlier work that sought to correlate dust concen- tration in the environment with pneumoconiosis should be renewed with modern techniques. Guides for exposure should not be restricted to the inplant environ- ment, said Pendergrass. While inplant exposure limits, unlike ambient air quality standards, are based primarily on health, general air contamination must be con- sidered in recommending guides for occupational health purposes. Occu- pational health specialists, he con- cluded, need to be dedicated to people, not to compliance with static legal requirements. Lasers, X-ray Radiography Present Potential Hazards Mass production and lower costs of laser devices permit their use not only in industry but in schools and colleges and even by teenage experimenters. The availability of this major scientific discovery makes the potential health implications ap- pear substantial. After making these comments, Verdun Randolph, assistant chief sanitary engineer, division of sani- tary engineering, Illinois Depart- ment of Public Health, cited potential hazards in using lasers and X-ray radiography and outlined the steps that have been taken in his State to avoid them. Laser Systems Besides eye injury, other potential health hazards associated with use of lasers may be electrical shock, toxic metal fumes, oxygen depletion, nitrous oxide production, ignition of combustibles, and contamination of food-to name a few. However, no major injuries to human beings have been reported to date, Randolph stated. Illinois' Laser System Registra- tion Law, the first of its kind in the country, the author said, went into effect January 1, 1968. It requires registration of laser systems, allows the Illinois health department to inspect them, and requires reporting of accidental injuries. Responsibility for administration of the law has been placed in the State health de- partment'is bureau of radiological health, under the division of sani- tary engineering. Under the new law, 48 installa- tions have registered 184 laser sys- tems, according to Randolph. They represent 30 industries, 14 schools, and four medical facilities. Most of the registered systems are used in pure research. We have begun observational type inspections of lasers, gathering basic data about the operation and characteristics of the 48 registered facilities, said the author. At some facilities, he reported, we found a lack of safety precautions, no pre- employment or periodic ophthalmo- logic examinations of employees and, in some instances, an almost apa- thetic attitude toward safety. One inspector was invited to look in,to the laser beam. The user indi- cated that after looking into the beam he was blinded for only a short time. An optometrist in regis- tering a laser explained that he used it for therapy on the eyes of patients. The licensing agency sub- sequently ordered him to discontinue use of the laser in his practice; such use fell in the broad sense under "surgery," which an optometrist is not allowed to practice in Illinois. Because of the lack of suitable in- strumentation, the most effective means of preventing injury from lasers appears to be through educa- tion, concluded the author. Industrial Radiography Various Illinois laws and regula- tions apply to the use of industrial radiography. The users are in- spected, and enforcement is in accordance with these laws. Regu- lations include mandatory film badge monitoring and reporting, the author pointed out. The rules for enclosed radiographic units require that they be provided with inter- locks, proper door fastening mech- anisms, and adquate alarms. Open radiographic facilities, defined as those capable of being moved about within a plant or transported to different job sites, are not covered by specific rules. The user is re- quired to supply the health depart- ment with a detailed description of the location and the normal and maximum operating conditions un- der which the machines are used. Open facilities also are given inspection priority. As with lasers, some users of X-ray radiography have not received adequate training; nor have written operating instructions been pre- pared. Consequently, the operator contributes to unnecessary exposure of personnel to radiation. When un- trained persons use X-rays, declared Randolph, they present a potential health hazard to themselves and to others in the area. We have never had to call a hear- ing for an industrial X-ray radio- graphic facility because of its failure to meet requirements, Randolph noted, in contrast to the medical X-ray regulatory program in which it is necessary to call a hearing oc- casionally. We find, said the author, that correcting existing health haz- ards is mainly a matter of education rather than regulation. Few Medical Rejections Among "Special Hires" Of 257 "special hire" applicants examined for jobs with the New Jer- sey Bell Telephone Company in Newark, only 15 of a total of 23 men not offered jobs were rejected for medical reasons. According to Dr. George P. Bisgeier, medical director of the company, only one man of the 257 was considered medically un- suited for any kind of employment with the company, because he was debilitated following infectious hepa- titis and had severe congenital skeletal abnormalities. A total of 173 men were hired. The jobs included handling ma- terial in the supply house, driving Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 239</page><page sequence="52">light trucks, coin box collections, business machine operation, office assistance, and crafts or technical work of a limited nature. Bisgeier's report covered exami- nations given in the first 6 months of the program, from January to July 1968. Examinations consisted of a self-administered history, phys- ical examination, chest X-ray, urinalysis, and audiometric and visual testing. An uncorrectable medical condition that would be a safety hazard to the employee or others was the only criterion used to disqualify an applicant. Ninety-nine men were found to have minor correctable defects or to be in a need of further medical in- vestigation. These conditions in- cluded dental caries, overweight, hearing and vision defects, ortho- pedic defects, rheumatic heart dis- ease, epilepsy, and narcotics use. Fifty-one of the 99 were hired. Twelve of the 257 men originally examined were suspected of using narcotics. Five were not hired, four were on the payroll for a period of weeks or months, and three re- mained on the payroll. One of the three was proved never to have used narcotics, and the other two are for- mer addicts who are under the reg- ular supervision of the medical department. Bisgeler said the question of whether an addict can be kept on the payroll and rehabilitated by outpa- tient treatment is still unresolved. In- dustrial physicians must learn to recognize an addict, establish a rela- tionship with a laboratory equipped to detect narcotics in specimens, and learn about treatment facilities available. He believes that in hiring the hard core unemployed some of the usual hiring procedures can easily be changed to take care of certain problems. For example, an applicant who needed surgery was placed on the payroll and immediately re- ferred for surgery. He sees great op- portunities for service, because industrial physicians can motivate some of the applicants to obtain treatment and reach satisfactory medical levels. The loss rate of special applicants was 24 percent, while for regular male applicants during the same period the loss rate was 43 percent. According to Bisgeier, this ratio was, entirely unexpected and caused some "soul searching" among the com- pany's staff. Phone Company's Nurses Examine Job Applicants All initial health reviews of ap- plicants seeking jobs with the tele- phone company in Canada are now carried out by the company's nurses except in small places where Bell Canada does not have health serv- ices available. Referrals are made to physicians for medical opinion, when appropriate. Dr. D. C. Bews, medical director, and Dr. J. H. Baillie, associate medi- cal director of Bell Canada, Mon- treal, said they had found that this screening role can be delegated to nurses if they have the training and interest and if the health service has a continuing program of health supervision. The present policy was put into effect in January 1968. In the 4 pre- vious years, it was in effect only for female applicants. Earlier, from 1953 to 11963, examinations by nurses largely replaced the use of physicians in the health assessment of female applicants, but final review and categorization of applicants re- mained a responsibility of the med- ical man. Experience has shown that nurses are able to complete nearly all the examinations. Ninety-five percent of the 12,733 examinations givenl to women in 1965 and 1966 were com- pleted by nurses. In only 696 cases was the physician's advice required to complete the examination. In 1966, the saving of expenses to the medical department by using nurses amounted to $22,000, and in 1967 it was nearly $21,000. Dollar savings for the 2 years do not re- flect the release of 2,600 hours of physician time in the company's nine major health centers for serv- ices which only fully trained physi- cians can perform, the authors pointed out. When the decision was made to use nurses for the initial health re- views of men as well as women, there were several problems to be faced: the acceptability of the plan by both management and applicants, the extent and scope of the health review, and the nurses' ability to adequately assess the musculoskele- tal system of male applicants, par- ticularly in regard to backs and knees. In the latter aspect, however, the company was in a fortunate position because in 1950 it had introduced a system of assessing the musculo- skeletal sysitem. The authors believe that when this system of exercises is properly carried out a trained ob- server can adequately assess the range of movements of all the im- portant joints in the body. If devia- tions from normal are found, the nurse refers the applicant to a mem- ber of the medical staff for further assessment. Dental Health Differences in Use Persist Despite Dental Prepayment In a prepaid dental plan with members having no direct cost, high socioeconomic status, and high readi- ness, people still give regular peri- odic dental care low priority, stated Dr. Mata K. Nikias, School of Pub- lic Health and Administrative Medi- cine, Columbia University. Even in the group with the most favorable conditions present, less than one out of two sought prepaid dental serv- ices at least once a year over a period of 3 years. Two population groups entitled to prepaid dental care through mem- bership in Group Health Dental Insurance, Inc. (GHIDI) of New York City, a communitywide pre- payment plan, were compared to see if the method of obtaining and paying for dental care coverage was associated with differential patterns of use of the services, Nikias said. 240 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="53">Extractions per 100 visits in GHDI cross-section sample and voluntary groups in first year in plan, by age and sex Cross- Voluntary Sex and age group section groups sample 14 years or under: 1 Male -12. 0 6. 1 Female -11. 3 7. 9 15 years or over: 2 Male -17. 1 15. 2 Female -15. 3 11. 7 1 376 persons, cross-section sample; 214 persons, voluntary groups. 2 1,262 persons, cross-section sample; 515 persons, voluntary groups. Members of the one group, repre- senting the majority o-f GHDI volun- tary groups, had dental prepayment as a fringe benefit of employment with premiums contributed by em- ployers or union; members of the other group, the GHDI voluntary groups, elected to participate in the plan and paid the entire premium themselves. Employees in both groups and their families were en- titled to fairly comprehensive den- tal services at the private offices of dentists of their choice. Such comparisons were under- taken, Nikias asserted, because of the implications that variance of use pat- terns between these two types of prepayment populations may have for understanding use of dental serv- ice, planning of dental services, as- sessment of their cost, and future growth of prepayment. The study was based entirely on analysis of the GHDI plan's records, according to Nikias. The GHDI membership was represented by a 10 percent stratified systematic sample constituting a cross section of sub- scribers with their dependents. Members in voluntary groups were considerably more likely to use prepaid dental services than the general GHDI membership. Patterns of care among only thos'e persons who received some prepaid dental care indicated that the two prepay- ment groups did not differ in amount and type of care received per patient and in the proportion of heavy, moderate, and light users. Such evi- dence, she stated, suggested that it was not the greater amount of un- met need for care that induced voluntary group members to join the prepayment plan and to use its bene- fits to a greater extent than mem- bers in the average plan. Does voluntary dental prepayment appeal most to persons requiring a great amount of dental care and who are aware of it? Nikias stated that evidence from the study sug- gested that if "high dental needs" induced voluntary group members to join GHDiI and then to utilize its benefits to a greater extent than the general GHDI membership, their needs were perceived rather than biologic or objective needs. Nikias based this conclusion on the similarity of treatment patterns and on evidence from the study which suggested that GHDI mem- bers under voluntary enrollment, who presumably were sensitized to having dental needs and who were also oriented toward doing some- thing about them, had better dental health than regular GHDI members when both populations joined the plan. An index used of tadvanced dental disease and of past dental neglect wais the proportion of visits devoted to extractions (see table). Members of voluntary groups were distinctly more likely .to seek dental care annually compared with the rest of GHDI membership. Such preven- tive dental practices by voluntary group members were consistent with the explanation of their greater than average dental health concern and willingness to act accordingly. Nikias said that social class and joining a voluntary dental prepayment plan were independently related to pre- ventive dental practices. Both factors together were more strongly related to annual care. She concluded that persons who join prepayment plans voluntarily are more likely to use dental care than persons who obtained coverage as a fringe benefit of their work group membership. The data from the study of the present plan do not support the view that voluntary den- tal prepayment appeals to those "per- sons requiring more than average amount of dental care." Medicaid Dental Services Fall Short of Goals Only one-fourth of persons eligi- ble for dental care under Medicaid in Erie County, N.Y., actually re- ceived any care during a 2-year period, declared Dr. Robert M. O'Shea and Dr. G. Donald Bissell, Erie County Department of Health and the School of Dentistry, State University of New York, Buffalo. New York State's Medicaid pro- gram removed the financial impedi- ment to dental care for an estimated one-third of its population, or 6 million persons, from May 1, 1966, until cutbacks of eligibility levels made in April 1968. By early 1968, 31/2 million had actually enrolled, with 1 million of these on welfare, the authors stated. A study of dental services under Medicaid was made of the computer- ized fiscal records in Erie County, N.Y., by the authors, and a 5 percent random sample of monthly pay- ments from November 1967 to April 1968 was studied. Analysis of data on 1,612 patients included welfare category, age of patient, and cost of derntal care. In addition to persons already qualifying for public assistance (old age, aid to the blind, dependent children, or the disabled), the medi- cally indigent were included, the authors said. Federal reimbursement was possible for dental services to "medically indigent" minor children whose families were not on public assistance and for those over 65 under a title XIX clause allowing "optional" services. Care of those between 21 and 65 was paid for by the State. New York set its basic eligibility requirement at $6,000 (after taxes Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 241</page><page sequence="54">alnd health insurance premiums) for a family of four to meet the require- ment for expanding any existilng programs. The quality and adequacy of these services under the optional services program, stated the authors, were to be within responsible limits of those services available to most other persons in the community. Cost of Dental Care In 1965, the year immediately pre- ceding Medicaid, Erie County spent $130,000 to pay approximately 5,800 vouchers. The county spent more than $4 million for dental services for more than 54,000 Medicaid re- cipients from early 1966 until April 1968. The bills of approximately 6,000 persons per month were being paid by the time the program was 2 years old. The authors noted that in a care program serving all ages, there was a great range in the amount of the dental bills. Fifteen percent of the bills were for $10 or less, 11 percent for more than $300, and the bills of some few patients exceeded $500. The estimated median bill, however, was about $39; almost two-thirds of all bills were under $50. There is a clear relationship between age and cost, asserted the authors. More than 50 percent of the youngest patients (5 years and under) had dental bills of less than $20, and the bills of almost all the young children were less than $50. The majority in all age groups under age 25 had total bills under $50. Only 36 percent of those 56-65, and 39 percent of those 66 and over, had bills less than $50. The number of bills of more than $200 did not rise sharply until 26 or older, emphasized the authors. They believe that the criticism that Medicaid would be deluged by unreasonable requests for costly prosthetics are unfounded, because the group of elderly patients was small relative to the rest of the Medicaid sample. Dental Care Services In the sample, each person received an average of approximately seven services for a total of more than 11,334 separate services. The services offered are listed in the followiing to ble. Per- Type of services cent of serv- ices Charting, history, oral exam- ination - -10 Recall examination - - Radiographs - - 20 Prophylaxes- - 8 Topical fluoride treatment - 1 Periodontal -(1) Routine extraction- - 16 Surgical extraction or ex- posure -- Alveolectomy -() Pulpcapping, pulpotomy 1 Other endodontics, such as root canal -(1) One-surface amalgam - - 17 Two-surface amalgam -- 10 Three-surface amalgam 2 Other operative procedures, such as silicates- - 6 Crown and bridge -() Full upper denture- - 1 Full lower denture - - Immediate denture - (l) Partial denture - - Additional clasps- - 1 Denture repair or rebase 1 Palliative treatment - - General anesthesia- (1) Consultation- - 0 Miscellaneous surgical pro- cedures -() Total -100 ' Less than Y2 percent. Only a handful, about one in 20, got topical fluoride treatments. (Erie County has had fluoridated water for several years.) About one-third received one or more simple extrac- tions, the authors noted. The majority of people who had simple extractions had only one or two teeth removed. More than half received one or more single-surface restora- tions; a little less than one-half got two-surface fillings; about one in eight received three-surface fillings. Full dentures were given to a small numiber; 10 percent got uppers, 7 percent lowers. To date, Medicaid has not pro- vided the lower socioeconomic group the dental care as originally hoped, as is shown by the distribution of s9rvices according to welfare status of the patients. Medically indigent Fre- Per- patients quency of cent On public assist- ance -259 16 Not on public assistance- 1, 353 84 Total- 1,612 100 In the whole Medicaid population the "medically indigent only" out- numbered those on welfare by a ratio of about 2: 1, but for dental services, the ratio wvas more than 5: 1. The authors believe that if legislation providing dental care is going to work, it is imperative to build in a comprehensive, well-structured plan for innovative educational methods drastically to alter dental attitudes and the low priority that (lentistry has on the scale of patient values. A large segment of the population did not receive adequate dental care be- fore Medicaid and is not taking ad- vantage of its provisions now. Dental Health Services Have Bright Future Growing Federal support to dental health programs, coupled with the vigorous leadership, of the dental and allied professions, assures a bright and substantial future for the na- tion's dental health, stated Dr. Viron L. Diefenbach, Assistant Surgeon General, and Director, Division of Dental Health, Public Health Service. Medicare and Medicaid Large amounts can and are being spent on dental health, Diefenbach said, but dentists should make sure the public gets full value for every dollar spent. Although Medicare pro- vides some limited benefits, dentists must see to it that patients who qualify actually benefit to the full extent of their entitlement. That Medicare has a weak dental insur- ance program is traceable, at least in part, to the failure of dentists to fight for dental coverage, emphasized Diefenbach. Title XIX permits States to de- 242 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="55">velop health programs for certain beneficiaries, and it authorizes, but does not yet make mandatory, a sig- nificant range of benefits. Not all States include dental care, but those which have done so get an energetic response. Diefenbach believes that dental services that are now optional will become mandatory for all Medi- caid programs by 1975. The amount of future interest, however, which States show in den- tal services may very well be deter- mined by the extent to which the dental profession insists upon the inclusion of dental care and the guid- ance it provides in structuring State programs, he emphasized. Services for Children The Division of Dental Health has been the professional dental adviser to Office of Economic Opportunity programs for nearly 3 years. Parents of children in Head Start programs now say that dental care is near the top of their list of wanted services-a fact which suggests that in Head Start, dental programs are now a solid success, according to Diefenbach. The Office of Education supports dental health services for deprived children, and because there is a logi- cal connection between this program and a preschool program like Head Start, better planning, 'and adminis- tration could multiply many times over the dental services received by these children, according to the author. The Children's Bureau also is in- creasing emphasis oin dental treat- ment in their long-established pro- grams of health coverages for chil- dren and pregnant women. During the past 5 years the Children'.s Bu- reau dental expenditures have risen from $1.7 million to $7.7 million, Diefenbach stated. A nationwide pilot care project for children was recommended by the American Dental Association, urged by President Johnson, and authorized by Congress under the Child Health Act of 1968. Money for support of its programs wais not authorized in 1968, but in this act, Congress added a new requirement for approval of State plans for for- mula grants under title V. State plans must now provide for the de- velopment of demonstration pro- grams in needy areas and among groups in special need "with special attention to dental care for children. . . ." Other Federal Programs Diefenbach mentioned briefly other federally supported pro- grams-education and manpower programs to provide more dentists and auxiliaries, applied research to increase the practitioner's skill and productivity, preventive programs like community fluoridation, screen- ing for oral cancer and periodontal disease, oral science research and technology, and continuing education for practitioners, teachers, and dental researchers. Occlusal Relations Differ In White, Negro Children The occlusal relations of 10- to 12- year old white and Negro children who grow up in a fluoridaited com- munity differ, stated Dr. Herschel S. Horowitz and Joe Doyle, Division of Dental Health, Public Health Service. Occlusal variables were measured for 718 schooll children, 321 white and 397 Negro, in Chattanooga, Tenn., which, at the time of the sur- vey, had fluoridated its water supply for more than 14 years at a level of 0.8 ppm. The findings on the 10 vari- ables were reported by Horowitz and Doyle as follow's. Dental age. (The children's dental age, wais classified according to the status of eruption of each child's permanent teeth.) Negro children were of a more advanced dental age than the white children and, within each race, girls were more advanced than boys, the authors stated. Gen- erally, Negro boys tended to be at the same state of dentail develop- ment as white girls. Molar relation. (The anteropos- terior occlusal relation of maxillary and mandibular first permanent molars was classified by assessing the interdigitation of the upper and lower first permanent molars on each side of the mouth while the children's jaws were in centric rela- tion.) A greater percentage of Negro children had bilaterally normal molar relations than did white chil- dren. Considerably moire white chil- dren had unilateral or bilateral Angle class II molar relations than Negroes; nearly 34 percent of 'the white children had either unilateral or bilateral class II molar relations, compared with only 11 percent of the Negroes. Buccal and lingual crossbite. No appreciable differences were found between the white and Negro chil- dren or between the sexes with regard to crossbite. Overjet. Negro children tended to have lower overjet scores than whites; nearly 18 percent of the Negroes had scores of 1 or 2 mm. of overjet whereas only 9 percent of the white children had comparable scores. Overbite. White children tended to have greater overbite scores than Negroes. About 10 percent of Negro children ha'd negative or 0 overbite scores contraisted to less than 2 per- cent of the white children. Nearly half the white children had overbite scores of 5 mm. or greater as op- posed to only 16 percent of Negro children. Maxillary midline diastema. Negro children had maxillary mid- line diastemas more often than white children; 19 percent of Negroes and 8 percent of whites had diastemas of 2 mm. or greater. Midline deviation. White children had more and greater interarch mid- line deviations than Negroes. Forty- two percent of the white children had no midline deviations, whereas more than half (54 percent) of the Negroels had none. Relatively twice as many white children as Negroes had midline deviations of 2 mm. or greater. Frenum attachment. The distance from the point of attachment of the upper labial frenum on the alve- olar ridge to the tip of the gingival papilla between the central incis,ors was greater in Negro children than whites. For ab'out 29 percent of the Negro children, this distance was 7 mm. or greater, whereas only 7 per- cent of the whites had measurements this large. Tooth displacement. Negro chil- Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 243</page><page sequence="56">dreni had fewer anterior displaced teeth than white children; nearly one-half of the Negroes were free of anterior tooth displacements com- pared with only about one-third of the whites. Almost 43 percent of white children had two or more an- terior teeth displaced; the corre- sponding figure for Negroes was 30 percent. Anterior spacing. Negroes tended to have more spacing between their upper anterior teeth than whites. More than three-fourths of the white children and only about three-fifths of the Negro children had no upper anterior spaces. Only 10 percent of the white children had two or more upper anterior spaces whereas 26 percent of the Negroes had as many. In summary, Negro children had a better interarch relation between their first permanent molars and more available space in each arch for their permanent teeth, Horowitz and Doyle stated. Data on standardized, objective measurements of occlusal relations are needed for children of all age groups living in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities to allow a better understanding of the prob- lems of malocclusions, the authors said. Such data may eventually prove valuable in planning public programs of orthodontic care. Dental Care for Patients Missing in RMP Projects Dentists could make a real con- tribution to their patients under the Regional Medical Programs, accord- ing to Dr. Sherman L. Cox, Division of Dental Health, Public Health Service. Under the Heart Disease, Cancer, and Stroke Amendments of 1965, each program is required to have a regional advisory group to advise in the establishment and operation of the program. The advisory groups, by law, consist of practicing physi- cians, medical center officials, hospi- tal administrators, representatives of other agencies, organizations, and members of the public. Only about 60 dentists are among the more than 2,000 members of the 54 advisory groups, Cox said. Although there has been little formal inclusion of dentists in the programs and little project develop- ment by dental agencies, Cox believes that dental care should be included. Regional centers where treatment techniques are developed for patients who have received sur- gery or radiation therapy for the control of cancer of the head and neck need clinical research in the area of maxillofacial rehabilitation. He stated that the closely allied prob- lems of cleft lip and palate and oral and speech rehabilitation could be included in these research projects. State Programs Some States, however, do have dental components included in their Regional Medical Programs, Cox as- serted. For example, the University of North Carolina Dental School, in cooperation with the State's three medical schools, has the first dental program in the country to receive money from the program. This pro- gram began July 1, 1968. The Fed- eral share will be $230,000 for the first 3 years. He stated that efforts to expand and improve participation of the State's dental profession in patient care in community hospitals include continuing education activities and a study of dental facilities in com- munity hospitals. Ten such hospitals will be selected for a pilot program in continuing education for dentists and physicians. Emphasis will be placed on the dentist's role in com- prehensive care of patients with various serious medical problems. An RMP program in Texas, Cox reported, has a dental project to provide cooperative arrangements among the various dental, educa- tional, and patient care institutions in the State. It will expand maxillo- facial prosthetic services and develop continuing education courses for dentists, particularly those practic- ing in rural areas. The Michigan Regional Medical Program has a project to assist the practicing dentist in oral cancer de- tection and to manage patients whose cancer or cancer treatment affects their oral health. Cox said this pro- gram wvill provide information on oral diagnosis for practicing physi- cians, and it stresses the importance of early consultatioln concerning oral lesions. A region in Connecticut is planning continuing education courses for physicians and dentists. This project will develop a "university environ- ment" in the community hospital for planning and coordinating activities such as continuing education, medi- cal information centers, and a re- gional television network. Other Opportunities in RMP's Cox said Regional Medical Pro- grams provide an opportunity to es- tablish delntal care demonstration projects in a hospital environment as part of the goal of delivering health care by the most effective methods. In such projects dental school faculty members can work more closely with their medical col- leagues in providing patient care. Cox emphasized that State dental directors have a responsibility to participate in these programs to in- sure that adequate dental projects are included for the patients in their jurisdiction. Dentists in private practice could also participate by providing treatment, by serving on advisory committees, land by attend- ing refresher courses. He also as- serted that dentists in the service of the Federal Government have an obligation to insure that various dental programs are coordinated with the regional programs. Cox believes that in creating an initial program, no region, before seeking an operational grant, can possibly determine all program ob- jectives and design appropriate proj- ects to meet them. A few well- designed projects are sufficient to begin a program with supplemental proposals submitted as appropriate. This concept is important for dental programs. Dentistry can be included in a supplemental program even if it is not included originally. Dentists to Alert Patients Who Smoke to Cancer Risk Smoking is a deep-rooted, highly personal habit that has become a social institution, and there are no simple solutions and no sirngle edu- cational manipulation that will sig- 244 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="57">nificantly reduce the problem de- clared John A. *Weir, director, Smokin- and Health Project, Ameri- canl Dental Association. The data from two prospective mortality studies show that cigarette smokers have a higher relative risk for cancer of the buccal cavity than for cancer of the pharynx. The smoker's risk for cancer of the tongue is greater than indicated by com- bined figures for the buccal cavity, Weir noted. Although research at- tempts to delineate the exact nature of smoking's relationship to oral cancer must continue, there is enough evidence to warrant reducing ciga- rette smoking to reduce oral cancer and other conditions. In 1964, Weir said, ADA con- tracted with the National Clearing- house for Smoking and Health of the Public Health Service to study current preventive education and to find more effective ways for profes- sional authorities to educate their patients. A program of patient edu- cation will be developed for use by the dentist in private practice, he stated. The most effective way, Weir de- clared, for the dentist to educate and alert the patient is in the dein- tal office. He believes that the dental visit is conducive to effective educa- tion because the patient is usually relatively healthy and, therefore, most psychologically receptive to in- formation and suggestions rendered by a professional health figure. The dentist will be better quali- fied to initiate discussion, according to Weir, if he is well informed on the subject. To achieve this, the smoking and health project office of ADA has subcontracted with two dental schools, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Nebraska, for the development, evaluation, and local distribution of education materials. Information is placed in profes- sional publications, and undergrad- uate, postgraduate, and continuing education programs at the plartici- pating schools have been developed. A newsletter featuring abstracts of smoking reisearch is published and circulated to all dentists in the ex- perimental areas of Nebraska and southwestern Pennsylvania, he said. Weir listed patient education ma- terials and techniques as follows: an appropriately worded sign for dental reception areas requesting patients to refrain from smoking, educational pamphlets, filmstrips, and educational slides. All the aids are designed to be used within the dental office, he said. The concerned dentist should not expect that all, or even many, of his patients will quit smoking because of his educational activity. Last year, Weir emphasized, more than 1 million Americans quit smoking. If each dentist helped only one of his patients to make a similar decisioln during the coming year, the number who quit smoking would be more than 10 percent greater than it was this year. Is Child's Oral Self-image Important? The preference of children for various facial appearances associ- ated with different types of occlusion may serve as a siubjective frame of reference for the dental patient and thereby influence his motivation to seek or cooperate with orthodontic treatment, stated Dr. Lois Cohen and Dr. Herschel S. Horowitz, Division of Dental Health, Public Health Service. In January 1967, 759 school chil- dren in Chattanooga, Tenn., were studied to determine how children perceive occlusal relations in others and in themselves. Most children were between 10 and 12 years old and in grades 5, 6, and 7. Stanford- Binet initelligence scores, taken 5 months before the study, resembled the shape of a normal distribution with not much variation between language and nonlanguage com- ponents, the authors stated. Each child was shown nine draw- ings (11 by 141/_ inches) of heads of children about his age and of the same sex. The drawings were used to overcome any literacy or language barriers, and the half-tone technique was used because more than half the children were Negro, Cohen and Hor- owitz said. The heiads of b)oys and girls were identical, except for the oral area and the hair style which differentiated sex. Preferential Ranking The numbered pictures of nine oc- clusal conditions were placed in ran- dom order, and the child was asked to select the picture that looked the best. After he ranked the pictures, the child was asked to choose the one which looked most like himself (or herself), so that a measure of self-perception could be obtained. Cohen and Horowitz noted that regardless of race, sex, age, and in- telligence, 'there was a general uni- formity in the hierarchy of prefer- ences in the following order: ideal occlusion, open bite, mandibular pro- trusion, midline deviation, maxillary protrusion, excess spacing, bimaxil- lary protrusion, crowding, and finally repaired cleft lip. Cohen and Horowitz stiated that contrary to expectation, the boys ranked a protruding lower jaw lower than did the girls. Those children with average intelligence scores of less than 70 ranked mandibular pro- trusion higher than did any other subgroup. Girls ranked maxillary protrusion two steps higher than did boys, the authors said. Ten-year-old children, whose permanent teeth had not yet erupted, and who may have missing primary teeth, ranked excess spac- ing higher than did older children. Bimaxillary protrusion, thought to be more common among Negroes than 'amiong whites, was ranked higher by the whites. 'There was a three-step difference by sex in ranking ibimaxil- lary protrusion; boys ranked this condition in fifth 'position whereas girls placed it in eighth 'position. Crowding was almost always placed near the bottom in ranking. Self-Image The largest proportion of children ;said that they themselves h'ad ideal occlusion, explained the lauthors. More girls than boys, 'more Negroes than whites, and the lesser intelli- gent more than those of higher in- telligence chose mandibular protru- sion as their self-image. As for mid- line deviation, more boys, more whites, and slightly more children of higher intelligence chose this con- dition than did their contrasting subgroups, noted Cohen and Horo- witz. More boys than girls, more Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 245</page><page sequence="58">younger children than older, andl more of lower intelligence than of higher intelligence chose excess spac- ing as their self-image. More Research Needed The authors believe that by conm- bining a subjective frame of refer- ence with objective occlusal measure- ments it is possible that a feasible public health tool or index can be developed for screening children for orthodontic treatment programs. They emphasized, however, that a workable index will need consider- able additional research, and the method used in this stuldy should be replicated on other representative cross sections of children. The reliability and validity of the pictures need to be determined, pos- sibly by data from accumulated in- terviews and reviews by panels of experts. Because attitudes of the mother seem to be related to obtain- ing orthodontic treatment for the child, parental attitudes, particu- larly those of mothers, need to be related to attitudes of their chil- dren, Cohen and Horowitz stated. Emergency Health Services Health Commissioner Tells Story of Hurricane Beulah Only 18 lives were lost during the 15 days Hurricane Beulah raged over Texas in September 1967, although the storm was the worst natural dis- aster ever recorded in the State. Beulah was the third most destruc- tive hurricane in history. More than 8,000 persons were injured, 542 homes were destroyed, 2.3,000 homes were damaged, and 513 small businesses were destroyed. Damage to public facilities amounted to $1 million, and other property loss totaled $1 billion. Practically all of south Texas below San Antonio w-as flooded. Dr. James E. Peavy, commissioner of the Texas State Department of Health, said that the small number of deaths proved the value of a good warning system, preplanning, and the dedication, will, and resolution of all people involved in emergency activities when the public welfare is at stake. Preparations for disaster relief were begun when Beulah was still distant. The Governor ordered all agencies to emergency standby. Agency representatives staffed the emergency operations center, a deep underground installation in Austin. The Governor moved into the center and took personal charge. Routine activities of 17 divisions of the State health department were comnpletely redirected. Staff members were on duty at the center around the clock, receiving and relaying information and requests for aid to Peavy and other personnel, and coordinating health activities with those of other agencies. Eleven packaged disaster hospitals were pressed into use. The State health department's division of dis- aster health and medical services marshaled its district organization fcr disaster medical care, and the district director for the area struck by the storm directed medical treat- ment activities throughout the Rio Grande Valley. Volunteer physicians and nurses were flown into the area by the National Guard. Personnel and facilities of local heal th departments and migrant labor projects per- formed valuable service, not only for Texas residents but also for Mexi- cans who were forced to flee across the river to higher ground. Public health nurses, physicians, veteri- narians, and laboratory specialists from the State health department joined in relief activities. Water analyses were performed on nearly 1,800 water samples by regional laboratory personnel in Brownsville, Corpus Christi, and Houston. Typhoid vaccine, which the State health department produces, v.was rushed to the area by public safety department and Air Force planes. Food inspectors removed 15 mil- lion pounds of food from the market because of flood damage or contam- ination, and salvaged 31/2 million pounds for use. Sanitary engineering personnel sanitized highway depart- ment trucks quickly so that drink- ing water could be transported to the flooded area. The marine re- sources division maintained surveil- lance of the storage and distribution of seafood that was in danger of contamination. From past experience, health de- partment personnel knew that mosquitoes would be a major prob- lem. Entomological investigators recorded as many as 100 mosquito lightings per minute at the height of the infestation. Cattle died when mosquitoes clogged their noses and bronchial tubes. Air Force spray planes were asked to istand by. As soon as the rains stopped, four large transport planes, each capable of spraying 25,000 acres a day, began operations. Malathion was applied *at the rate of 3 ounces per acre in a spray mist or fog. Altogether, almost 75,000 gallons of insecticide were used to cover 3,250,000 acres of land in 15 counties. A commercial air service was contracted to supplement the work of the Air Force. The final cost of the Texas State Department of Health's response to health and medical problems created by the storm exceeded $800,000. Among the lessons learned from dealing with Beulah, Peavy men- tioned learning to mesh activities with other agencies more efficiently, to identify and eliminate bottlenecks in logistics, and to make firm deci- sions quickly, based on cool-headed analysis of options. He praised the cooperation of the Air Force, the Navy, the Office of Emergency Plan- ning, the Public Health Service, and the united cohesive effort of health departments on both sides of the Rio Grande. Health Department Role In Civil Disturbances Drawing on Deitroit's experiences during the 1967 civil disturbances, Dr. John J. Hanlon, former city com- missioner of health, offered sug- gestions, to health departinents that may face such emergencies. Hanlon, now Assistant Surgeon General and Deputy Administrator, Consumer Protection and Environ- 246 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="59">meintal Health Service, pointed out that of three priorities when riots occur-,assurance of the public safety and security, provision of prompt, effective medical care, and assurance of sanitary conditions in the community-the health agency is responsible for two. He emphasized the importance of setting up immedi- ately a 24-hour intelligence and com- munications network connecting po- lice, fire, health, social service, and related deplartments. Medical Facilities He outlined factors to be con- sidered in establishing primary emer- gency medical treatment centers. These should be in major hospitals with full-time medical staffs. Plans for reception and treatment of the injured should include, in addition to an efficient triage system, provision for isolating injured prisoners in one section of the hospital. To expedite functioning of the emergency facility, the existing pa- tient load should be reviewed to see if some patients can be dis- charged or transferred to other hos- pitals, and backup hospitals should be designated to receive the overflow at ithe emergency facilities and to care for the less seriously injured. Physicians, surgeons, and nurses from unaffected hospitals and from private practice can be recruited to staff the emergency centers, Hanlon said. In Detroit in 1967 they volun- teered in such numbers that it was never necessary to solicit profes- sional help. Extra laboratory and X- ray technicians and other auxiliary personnel are also needed in the emergency center hospitals. In De- troit, since health department activi- ties were curtailed during the dis- turbance, p,ublic health nurses worked as hospital nurses, and sanitarians performed a variety of services. He reminded emergency planners that staffing should also be flexible since peak activity seems to colme at certain times, such as during the early evening. Admissions iand meidical records offices also should be adequately staffed, he stateid, so that careful records are kept. During the 3 months following the Detroit disturb- ancesi the medical records were con- sulted by the local police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the McClel- lan committee, the Civil Rights Com- mission, the Public Health Service, and lawyers whose clients were treated at emergency centers. It may be necessary to post guards to protect exiternal hospital facilities (oxygen sysitem, powerhouse, heating plant, generators, and storehouses). Guards may also be needed to pre- vent unauthorized persons from en- tering the medical treatment center. Also in the emergency blueprint should be adequate stockpiles of medical supplies and arrangements to replenish the stockpiles. Chance can place a great burden on a small hospital isolated in the middle of the riot action area, and plans should take into account arrangements for delivering personnel and supplies if this situation occurs. Other Responsibilities During the disturbance the De- troit health department was called upon to make medical inspections and to care for minor injuries of large numbers of persons, detained in jails, prisons, and tempo'rary places olf detenti,on. The department was also responsible for inspection of sani- tary conditions in such facilities. Refuse and garbage accumulates when regular collections are cur- tailed; sanitary hazards may re- sult. Food spoilage may ensue when stores are looted or when there are power failures, Hanson declared. In Detroit sanitarians and inspectors entered the riot area ias soon as it was safe to insipect food stores and to prevent the siale or consumption of spoiled foods. The health department worked with the food industries to restock looted but undamaged food stores and, when an area's stores were destroyed, arranged to send in large trucks stocked with a variety of supplies. When price gouging was reported, the health commissioner was given power by the city council to 'set prices on food and necessary household items. Detroit's sanitarians not only con- demned stocks of spoiled food, drugs, and chemicals but inventoried des- troyed or damaged buildings; emer- gency housing situations such as overcrowding; dangerous conditions such a,s freestanding wvalls, broken glass, and exposed cellars; water anid !sewage problems; and situations conducive to growth of rodent, ver- min an(d fly populations. Emergency Health Services Need Coordinated System The emergency department of a hospital should be the front door, not the back door, for those in need of services, according to Dr. Joseph K. Owen, chief of the Hospital and Ambulance Services Branch, Divi- sion of Emergency Health Services, Public Health Service. In some places, Owen said, the emergency department is the weak- est point in the hospital, although the number of patients is eniormous. Many authorities believe emergency service should be a full-fledged de- partment for all hospitals. Much effort is being given to triage or sort- ing procedures to move patients quickly to the kind of care they need. The Public Health Service is plan- ning programs to upgrade patient care. Physical makeup and equipment of many hospital emergency depart- ments are not the best. State health officers and hospital planners might act now to seek public support for better emergency health care facili- ties in ;the future, Owen suggested. Many ambulances in use today were not built to provide the kind of emergency care needed. Work has been started to design a vehicle that will be an extension of the emer- gency department-an emergency room on wheels, capable of supply- ing resuscitation and other lifesav- ing measures at the scene of an acci- denit and enroute to the hospital. At the request lof the Public Health ,Service, the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council is making an extensive study of the medical criteria of ambulance equip- ment and design. [The Academy's findings were publ'ished in January 1969 in "Medical Requirements for Ambulance Design and E,quipment," which supplements the previous "Training of Ambulance Personnel and Others Responsible for Emer- gency Care of the Sick and Injured at the Scene and During Transport." Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 247</page><page sequence="60">Both documents can be used in the development of training programs.] A central dispatch service is es- sential in the community, and all calls for emergency care should be dispatched to this center to minimize delay. The center should maintain contact with hospitals, police, fire- men, civil defense groups, and others. Everyone in the community should be aware of this service and where it is located. The phone number should be listed in schools, public places, and homes. One universal phone number for all emergency calls in all communi- ties is a desirable goal; several Eu- ropean countries have adopted this idea. All ambulances should have equipment to communicate with hos- pitals, police, and the communiica- tions center. Television equipment in the ambulance could be used to have hospital-based physicians advise am- bulance personnel how to handle crit- ical situations; several pilot projects of this kind have been initiated. The Hospital and Ambulance Services Branch is part of the new Public Health Service Division of Emergency Health Services. Current program activities are geared to handle disaster needs and day-to-day emergency medical needs. The basic objective, Owen said, is to insure that every community in the United States evaluates, upgrades, and ex- pands its emergency services to form a coordinated system that will pro- vide every injured or siudden-illness patient adequate and timely care. The incentive lies in the thousands of persons who can be saved from death or disability. Statistics Priorities for Advances In Health Statistics Priorities in health statistics must be based upon the nation's priorities in health, emphasized Theodore D. Woolsey, director, and Philip S. Lawrence, associate director, Na- tional Center for Health Statistics, Public Health Service, in presenting an agenda for action. Public health administrators and planners need relevant data to quantify problems and to aid them in setting priorities and program goals, estimating costs, and measuring progress. Discussing major national health problems as a framework for deter- mining emphasis in health statistics, Woolsey and Lawrence pointed out that the health statistics field is ready to move against some of these problems, given the will and the re- sources. Unresolved methodological blocks stand in the way of moving against others. Data on Domestic Problems Planning, mounting, and evaluat- ing sustained attacks on the clusiter of problems centered around poverty, the cities, and the Negro demand a mass of detailed information. Yet the basic kinds of data-counts of the people, measures of their health, the health services they receive, the resources available, and the state of the environment in which they live- are not available for most cities, much less for subcommunities within those cities. With the exception of the vital statistics systems and the census, the nationwide data systems are not capable of providing the needed de- tail, Woolsey and Lawrence said. Exploiting the capability of the vital statistics system to provide much useful information bearing on these problems will be costly. Similarly, we will need new statis- tical data if we are to meet the challenge of improving the efficiency and quality of health services, the authors said. Such data must afford answers to the questions of who goes where, for what services, at what cost, and with what satisfaction. Some of this information is becom- ing available from the national health interview survey and hospital discharge survey of the National Center for Health Statistics. How- ever, the data must be more sharply pointed if they are to be truly rele- vant for current developments in medical care. Additional sources of information must be tapped if we are to learn the extent of the time gap between the discovery and the application of health knowledge. Even the simplest questions about the treatment pa- tients actually receive in the ordi- nary course of medical care have not been answered. Information is par- ticularly lacking about treatment given in homes, offices, and out- patient clinics. Some means must be found for obtaining the data from the persons and organizations that provide care. Woolsey and Lawrence suggested that unresolved methodological prob- lems bar the way particularly to the development of statistics relevant to other high-priority health problems such as data on the worsening state of the environment and on the be- havioral problems related to health- smoking and misuse of drugs. In- dices are needed by which to meas- ure progress against such problems as air pollution. Concepts of behav- ioral problems, wherever agreed upon, the authiors stated, must be translated into practical operational terms that can be applied in field surveys. In contrast, against the problem of rapid population growth in the United States, methods for gathering the needed statistics are at hand. What must be done, Woolsey and Lawrence commented, is to move from the single study to the contin- uing collection of national data. Statistical Problems The authors pointed out a number of issues of statistical methodology which cut across many of the na- tional health problems. One is the matter of modernizing the vital registration system, which provides much basic data about health and population growth, so that it will serve modern needs better. Another is the development of the means for gathering needed data about sub- jects of great sensitivity without in- fringing on a person's privacy. A third issue is how to estimate health care needs. The process of determin- ing the resources of manpower, serv- ices, and facilities that will be required to meet the health care needs of a given population is ex- ceedingly complicated, said Woolsey 248 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="61">and Lawrence. Any agenda for health statistics must include re- search on methods of determining needs, as well as practical demon- strations of the utility of the methods. The timelag of statisticians in sup- plying data is inevitably great, Woolsey and Lawrence emphasized. If, however, statistics are to be rele- vant to our health problems, if they are to make a difference in tomor- row's world, the time to start on the agenda is now. Effect of ICDA Revision On Cause-of-Death Data Classification of the underlying causes of death and the supporting procedures used to assign them have been changed in the Eighth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases Adapted, which came into use in the United States in 1968. These changes between the eighth and earlier classifications make in- terpretation of variations in mortal- ity patterns by cause of death difficult or even impossible, said Robert A. Israel and A. Joan Klebba, Division of Vital Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, Public Health Service. But, said the au- thors, comparability ratios may be applied to the mortality data classi- fied under the seventh revision to compensate for any distortion in trends in mortality for specific causes of death that arise from dif- fernees between the eighth and ear- lier revisions. Comparability ratios are com- puted by dividing the number of deaths assigned to a particular cause or group of causes under the eighth revision by the number of deaths assigned to the equivalent cause or group of causes under the seventh revision. The denominators of the ratios were obtained from all deaths in the United States in 1966; the numerators were obtained by re- coding according to the new revision of a stratified random sample of 1966 deaths. The table compares death rates per 100,000 for specific causes for the period January-June 1968 and the corresponding rates for the pe- riod January-June 1967 as reported and as revised by application of comparability ratios. Comparability ratios for more detailed causes of death by age, color, and sex are in preparation, the authors stated. Infant Mortality And Birth Weight Mortality in the first year of life varies much more widely by birth weight than by color or sex, Dr. Helen C. Chase, Office of Health Sta- tistics Analysis, National Center for Health Statistics, reported. She pre- sented preliminary data from a na- tionwide study of mortality among infants born in the United States in 1960. For this study, the birth and death records were linked for all infants born in 1960 who died under 1 year of age in 1960 and 1961. Linkage was possible for 107,038 infant deaths. Although this report focuses on birth weight, linkage of vital records per- mitted analysis of a number of other characteristics reported on the birth record, including the mother's age at time of birth, the birth order, and period of gestation. The study showed an overall in- fant mortality rate for the 1960 cohort of 25.1 per 1,000 live births, Chas;e said. Rates for males were about 30 percent higher than for females regardless of color; rates for nonwhite infants were about 90 percent higher than for white in- fants regardless of sex. Although the rates differed, these relationships agree with those routinely derived from unlinked records. Variations by Weight The range of infant mortality by birth weight is very great, said the author. By birth weight, infant mor- tality was highest for infants weigh- ing 1,000 gm. or less at birth; these children have little chance of sur- vival. Infant mortality decreased to its lowest level among infants weigh- ing 3,501 to 4,000 gm. at birth, after which it again increased. The rate for infants weighing 1,000 gm. or less at birth was more than 100 times the rate in the optimum group. Variations by Color The relative position of the infant mortality rates for white and non- white infants was not uniform, how- ever, over the entire birth weight, Death rates for January-June 1968 as reported and rates for January-June 1967 as reported and as revised by application of comparability ratio Seventh revision (1967) Compara-.

In the weight groups of 2,000 gm. oir less, the mor- tality rates for white infants were higher than for nonwhite; in the re- maining groups (more than 2,000 gm.), the reverse was true-rates for white infants were lower than those for nonwhite infants. When the infant period was di- vided into neornatal and postneonatal periods, neonatal mortality rates for white infants exceeded those for non- white infants in all weight gro;ups up through 3,000 gm. Neonatal mor- tality rates for nonwhite infants were higher than those for white in- fants for the remainder of the birth weight range and, for postneonatal mortality, throughout the entire birth weight range. At the same time, there were higher proportions of live births in the lower birth weight groups among nonwhite than among white infants. This concentration was noted up through 3,000 gm. Similar observations were re- ported in a study of a cohort of in- fants born alive in the United States during the period January-March 1950. Comparison of data from the two studies for the neonatal period showed an increase in the proportion of nonwhite infants weighing 2,500 gm. or less at birth-from 9.7 per- cent in 1950 to 12.9 percent in 1960. Over the same period, the proportion of white infants in this vulnerable age group declined slightly, from 7.0 to 6.8 percent. However, this disad- vantageous birth weight distribution among nonwhite infants was offset by more favorable neonatal mortal- ity in each birth weight group up through 3,000 gm. As a result, when the neonatal mortality rates were adjusted for differences in birth weight, a marked change in the relationship for white and nonwhite infants was revealed. While the adjusted rates were higher for nonwhite infants than for white in 1950, in 1960 weight-adjusted rates were lower for nonwhite in- fants than for white, both for males and females. Chase concluded that this rela- tionship i's not due to statistical artifacts associated with more com- plete recording of birth weight in- formation. It suggests, she said, that nonwhite infants weighing 2,500 gm. or less at birth may be more mature in gestation than white infants of the sam-e weight and therefore have a better chance of survival. The results emphasize the need for more exten- sive examination of the study data according to period of gestation. New Proxy Measure For Health Status An assessment of the health status of approximately 2,000 persons was desired as part of a study to quantify the determinants of the demand for health care. Dr. Arnold I. Kisch, as- sistant professor of preventive medi- cine, School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, and co- authors from the School of Public Health described a new proxy meas- ure that was developed to meet this need and reported results of two pretests of the procedure. Need for New Measure The need is very real, the authors commented, for a proxy measure of health status whose score will cor- relate as closely as possible with the assessment a physician might make on the basis of a thorough history and physical examination. The meas- ure we have developed, they said, is for use as a research tool in assess- ing the health status of large popu- lations for whom physicial examina- tion is impractical. The proxy contains four questions whose scoring is cumulative. The proxy score should relate inversely to the respondent's health status, Kisch and associates pointed out. Two questions relate primarily to acute illnesses and two to chronic illnesses. The period of recall in the original study was a year, and this period wvas also set as the interval in the proxy questions. The four proxy questions were ad- ministered to 185 patients at an am- bulatory care facility. It took about 2 minutes for a respondent to an- swer the four questions, said the authors. Each patient's complete medical history was then taken, and he was given a physical examination. Subsequently, the medical records of these patients were examined inde- pendently by two physicians, who gave a numerical rating assessing each patient's health. The physi- cians' ratings were compared with the proxy scores. This comparison cannot be done by regression analysis (least squares estimations) for a variety of reasons related to the char- acteristics of the proxy, Kisch and co-workers explained. Therefore, contingency table analysis was used. Results of Pretests The scores on the short self-ad- ministered proxy correlate closely with the physicians' appraisals based on physical examination and medi- cal history (see contingency table, which is based on the first of the two pretests). Yet, said !the authors, while the health status proxy is a significant predictor of patient health, in its present state it is not totally unbiased. The proxy appears to overestimate the number of per- sons in good health. Thirty-three persons rated by the proxy as in good health were rated by the physi- cians as being in medium or poor health. Fortunately, said the au- thors, this bias decreases as sicker persons are scored. The proxy also somewhat overestimated the num- ber in medium health. In rating poor Comparison of ratings of health status, by health score and by physicians Physicians Health score Good Medium Poor health health health Low (good health) 0-20 -97 28 5 Medium (medium health) 21-60 20 27 4 High (poor health) 61+ -0 0 4 NOTE: X2 = 74.3335 Contingency coefficient= 0.5354 Degrees of freedom== 4 Maximum likelihood ratio= 42.1689 X2 per degrees of freedom= 18.5834 250 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="63">healtli, the health score did not ap- pear to exhibit bias, but the cate- gory is small. The proxy measure is easy and quick to administer, Kisch and co- authors commented, and seems to be readily accepted by respiondents. It can be administered in a mailed questioninaire form as well as in a structured interview schedule. Thus, the piroxy is a new tool for surveys. It cannot be overemphasized, how- ever, they said, that the proxy is only a survey research tool, not in- tended as a substitute for the phys- ical examination in medical practice. Most States Follow Closely U.S. Standard Certificates A large majority of the registra- tion areas which revised their certifi- cates ;of vital events for use in 1968 followed closely the latest U.S. standard certificates, reported Dr. Robert D. Grove and Mary Frances Bonner of the Division of Vital Sta- tistics, National Center for Health Statistics, Public Health Service. This high degree of cooperation is particularly significant, they said, in view of the considerable changes in content and format of the standard certificates. The U.S. standard certificates of vital events are revised periodically by the Public Health Service in con- sultation with representatives of State vital statistics offices. The lat- est standard certificates were issued in 19637. Forty-six of the 56 registration areas revised at least one of their five certificates in 1967 or 1968, most of them in the latter year. Live birth and death certificates were revised by 42 registration areas, fetal death certificates by 41 areas, marriage certificates by 20 areas, and divorce certificates by 21 areas. Live Birth, Fetal Death The States followed the standard certificates most closely in the revi- sion of their certificates of death, live birth, and fetal death; changes in the contents of the latter two were most numerous and most important. Changes in the live birth and fetal death certificates are intended to provide more information on health in the perinatal period anld on fac- tors related to fertility. One new question on the stand- ard certificates, added by 38 areas, asks the dates of the last live birth and the last fetal death. "Date of last normal menses" has been sub- stituted for "completed weeks of pregnancy" in order to obtain more accurate data on the period of gesta- tion. In 1968, 34 areas adopted it. Four States and three cities had adopted the new form of the ques- tion earlier. Forty areas now ask for the month of pregnancy in which prenatal care began and the total number of visits for such care. On the standard certificates, a question concerning the highest grade of school completed by each parent was substituted for one on the occupation and industry of the father, because education was con- sidered a more accurate and useful indicator of socioeconomic status. The question was adopted by 41 areas. Another deletion was of the question, Is residence on a farm? None of !the States revising the cer- tificates retained the question. Death, Marriage, Divorce Whether the deceased lived on a farm and whether he served in the Armed Forces were among the ques- tions deleted ifrom the 19,68 U.S. standard death certificate and also by most of the areas revising their certificates. A new question, "Were autopsy findings considered in deter- mining the cause of death ?" was added by 43 areas, including four which had previously included it. Grove and Bonner cataloged the several new items added to the standard marriage and divorce cer- tificates. Despite the States' adop- tion of many of the suggested revi- sions, there is still considerable variation, they noted, in the content and format of marriage and divorce certificates. Greater ease of use dictated a number of changes in the format of the U.S. standard certificates. Protection of possibly prejudicial information was another primary consideration. Confidential sections were added to the new marriage and divorce certificates 'to facilitate the omission from certified copies of certain information-on race, educa- tion, and p,revious marital history. Of the 20 areas revising their mar- riage certificates, 13 added a confi- dential section for the first time. Such a section was included by 14 of the 21 areas revising their divorce certificates. On all U.S. standard certificates except the death certifi- cate, race was included in the confi- dential section. We Need To Shift Emphasis To Computer Input All the talent expended on mech- anisms for speedy processing and tabulation of data is of little avail unless equivalent talent is expended on determination of content and on control of the recording and collec- tion of the information. This is the conclusion of Dr. Carl L. Erhardt, director of planning for health in- telligence, and Jack Kirschenbaum, principal statistician, Department of Health, City of New York. They ex- plored the dangers inherent in being overly impressed with the output capabilities of a computer while ig- noring the real problems that exist in obtaining accurate, timely input data. Limits of Systems Approach Erhardt and Kirschenbaum pointed out that some management personnel believe that neither pres- ent nor forseeable computer tech- nology is in any sense capable of simulating large and complex sys- tems at a biological oir social level. Simplification of such problems by use of assumptions does not mean that such models represent real life or that such simulations provide ade- quate guidance to an understanding of the consequences of possible ac- tions. People who feel uncomfortable with ambiguity, says one executive, may create mathematical models which are not models of the real world, but only a small "knowable" segment of it. The real problem in decision making, according to this executive, is usually not the quanti- fication of data, but determining what factors are relevant and how relevant they are and what basic val- ues, assumptions, and biases are held by the decision maker.

Who, asked the authors, will oversee and control those who prepare the information for the machine to read, especially since this material may originate from a thousand or more different locations and persons? Example of Input Toil If it is decided that the New York City Commissioner of Health needs information, for example, on the age distribution of persons receiving pub- lic assistance in one small area, per- tinent information has to be recorded at the source for every person granted assistance. Facts must be transferred from the record to some input device, such as punched cards-unless a direct input arrange- ment is provided at each location receiving the necessary information. Provision has to be made to update the information regularly to elimi- nate people dropped from and added to the rolls. Input must be stoired so that facts can readily be recalled. If speed o-f recovery is demanded, it is possible to assemble the desired in- foraiatioia cuimulatively anid to regu- larly update it for recall at any tim-te. Someone, however, commented the authors, would hlave to anticipate the specific questioln, anld the essen- tial computer programs must have already beenl devised and be in place. How, they asked, can this procedure be efficienit when applied to every possible tabulationi that might be de- manded by any number of con- sumers? Ends such as the onie in this ex- ainple are not impossible of acconi- plishment, Erhardt alnd Kirschenl- baum observed. Emphasis is con- tinually on the output potentials, however, while the lengthy road to their realization and the expense for such a flexible product is conven- iently brushed over. The problem of gathering accurate, appropriate, timely data still presents itself in much the same form as in precom- puter days, they said. Statisticians must still advise program directors *o n th e data'es appropriateness. Clheeks, possibly computer-aided, have to be built into the tsystemii. Per- sonnel turnover and absenteeism, mechanical failures, shortages of program personnel and computer time, and the necessity to analyze data in such a way that the deciIsilon maker will be able to comprehend the results are all present problems. Health Education Foresees Major Changes For Health Educators Changes in intellectual technology, the technology of diffusion, interna- tional relations, and social-structural changes have been identified by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences' Commission on the Year 2000 as the major sources of change which could accelerate or deter the advancement of health and social development. Discussing implications of these sources of change for health educa- tion practice, Dr. Lowell S. Levin of Yale University's Department of Epidemiology and Public Health foresaw radical changes in the re- cruitment, training, and function of health educators during the next three decades. He predicted that professionalism will give way to more purely technical activities, con- sumers will take hold of policy and quality control, and there will be a unified system of recruitment, prep- aration, and training which will en- courage flexibility and continuity of both education and service. According to Levin, the technical changes which seem crucial for the future of society as a whole as well as for health professionals may not lie in the hardware of science, but, as stated by the commission, ". . . an intellectual technology in which such techniques as simulation, model con- struction, linear programing, and op- erations research will be hitched to tie coomiputers anid will become the nev tools of decision-making." The impact of such technology on the health worker can be expected to be both extensive and particular, Levin said. In the first instance, he wenit on, the sheer numbers of people concerned with health decision mak- inig must include all -those who make observations, ranging from exclu- sively clinical to group or community behavior observers. The goal is to achieve an identity of the service system with the decision-making or planning systeni. This means that every neighborhood health worker, every nurse, every physician, and every other health or health-related worker will become an ultimate re- source of primary data and feedback. Further, Levin stressed, the recip- ients of services and the community at large will also be involved as data and validation resources, a mianda- tory requirement in order to insure the democratization of the decisioni- making process. Without consumer and social involvement, there is the danger of a professional decision- making apparatus with values and priorities which may not reflect the goals of society. The most profound advances in the health care system will probably be in the poverty areas where con- sumer participation and control is emerging, Levin stated. In terms of their requirements for the new tech- nology of decision making, the plan- ner-designer has in the poverty popu- lations a lay resource for data of the highest order of sensitivity (validity) and relevance (integra- tion). The harvesting of this re- source can be achieved through community organization which en- courages consumier communication. This is considerably more than ask- ing people what they want; it in- volves a far more generous input of information on "how it is," in Levin's opinion. The health education specialist al- ready in the profession will have to change his objectives, technical skills, and self-image, Levin pointed out. Regarding his self-image, the health educator will have to relin- quish part of his role as teacher and give emphasis to his role as learner. He will have to continue, mechani- 252 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="65">cally at first, to pick up a niew ranige of signals from the population he serves; to retransmit these data with the least amniount of professional static, to value wvhat he learns as having essential worth, and to feed back to the consumer in a way which will encourage trust. The health educator's role as a communications link in the decision-making process will have to be complemented with his responsibility as a communica- tions "enabler," according to Levin. What will be called for is a reposi- tioning of the health educator from a leadership role to one of technical assistant once removed, said Levin. The objective will be to deter con- sumer dependency, increase con- sumer control, and reduce the mys- tique of health services on the one hand and to assist in sensitizing or making psychologically available the health system on the other, he con- tinued. In practice this will probably work out as a cross between ombuds- man and consultant. It will also en- tail a shift from an orientation char- acterized by general health goals es- tablished by professional determi- nation to a problem-centered orienta- tion focusing on emergent, temporal, and often health-related needs de- fined by consumers and the public at large. School Dropouts Learn Health Department Tasks A health department can become a "school" for disadvantaged youth, by involving them in a variety of practical learning situations in the community. By the same token, such youth can contribute many hours of health education service to the de- partment. These conclusions were voiced by Leland R. Kaiser, Tri- County Health Department, Aurora, Colo., and co-authors in describing the department's experimental pro- gram for 16 high school dropouts. Eight boys and eight girls spent 4 weeks at the department, under a grant from the U.S. Office of Educa- tion for a Colorado school district's "Dare-to-Care" program. During this time the students were rotated through the various department activities-home visits, clinics, staff conferences, restauran,t inspections, clerical routiiaes, lneighborhood iiothers' groups, field activities in health education, and so on. EImiphasis was on their active partic- il)ation as both learners and pro- Viders of service to patients, the au-thors said. The students spent much time in handing out health education pamphlets, doing clerical tasks, developing film, operating the offset press, and other tasks. Since the youngsters had never been exposed to a family living unit of instructioin and had been misin- formed regarding man-woman rela- tionships, a nurse-instructor held informal, coeducational ;sessions for them on childbirth, growth and de- velopment, bathing, teenage moral- ity, anid the family planning concept which included a discussion of fam- ily planning methods. The students expressed their appreciation for the opportunity to discuss their concerns WLith an adult, according to the authors. This on-the-job instruction had a ring of reality often absent froimi the usual classroom presenta- tiomi. Throughout the 4-week period, the students and staff met as a group to express their likes and dislikes, and adjustments were made based on these exchanges. The health depart- maeat staff had ample opportunity to "live" with the students and apply some of their theories of working with the disadvantaged. The Dare- to-Care students also were able to test their "theories" about adults. At the end of the p;eriod, a question- naire was distributed among the staff and the students for an evalu- ation of their experience. Staff reaction varied. It ranged from "the boys were unshaven, un- kempt, had a bad odor, and showed no initiative" to "responsible, coop- erative, and self-reliant." A wide range of opinion and feeling was elicited, the authors reported. The challenge of helping the student to find himself was a prominent staff motivation. A one-to-one relation- ship between staff member and student was considered most desirable. The staff's perception of its role was helping the students develop adult roles, providing adult models, clarifying personal ideals, setting educational goals, improving their interaction with adults, giving them a view of the world, exposing them to other people in need, helping them to become interested in them- selves, and helping them feel more secure. In other words, the public health personnel saw themselves as change agents, as community edu- cators, the authors said. The studen,ts responded best to staff members who liked them but were firm with them. Their candid responses to the questionnaire re- vealed that they were quite isensitive to the unspoken staff attitudes to- ward them. For example, one stu- dent did not like two of the staff members "cuz they were very snotty." The authors pointed oult that this absence of a diplomatic hypocrisy can be quite shocking to middle-class professionals who are not used to earthy and funda- mental expressions of interpersonal opinions. Asked to itemize their learning experiences, the students listed many which indicated that their view of what they learned was far more concrete and job specific than the staff's view of what they learned. For example, the following were among the numerous experi- ences mentioned: how to make a home visit, how to test blood and urine, who can receive services from the health department, dangers of radiation, how to type and file rec- ords, how to cook hamburger, effects of alcohol and smoking, how to oper- ate a public health clinic, and how to greet people. Hopefully, the authors remarked, the concrete activities are a vehicle through which more subtle nuances of human behavior are transmitted even though the students failed to identify any of these nuances. Do M.D.'s Communicate With Their Patients? To learn which attributes of the physician-patient interaction are related to outcome in terms of pa- tient satisfaction and followthrough on medical advice, Dr. Barbara M. Korsch, University of Southern Cali- fornia School of Medicine, Los Angeles, and co-workers studied 80;0 Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 253</page><page sequence="66">patient visits to a pediatric out- patient department by tape record- ing the verbal communication be- tween the physician and the patient's mother and by followup interviews with the patient's parents. The sample of patient visits con- sisted of first encounters between a patient's mother and a particular physician. The setting was a hospi- tal walk-in clinic which handles a variety of common, acute pediatric conditions. The physicians were at various levels of training; all had at least 1 year's experience in pedi- atrics. All the parents and physicians were aware of the presence of the tape recorder, the auithors reported. The conversation shown in the box illustrates some significant com- munication gaps which were re- peatedly found in the study: (a) obvious, excessive use of incompre- hensible medical jargon by the physi- cian, (b) the few times the parents were able to speak they expressed concern about diagnosis and cause of the illness and about self-blame, an issue which the aut.hors believe is crucial to most of the families of pediatric patients, and (c) a few unnecessary statements by the physi- cian which could only heighten parental anxiety. Regarding patient satisfaction and followthrough on medical advice, the components which can be related statistically to patient response in- clude the patient's perceptions of the "expressive role" of the physician- of the physician's being "more friendly," concerned, having good communication skills, and being reassuring. The authors also pointed out that clear statements of diagno- Tape-Recorded Conversation in a Pediatric Clinic FATHER How does his heart sound? PHYSICIAN Sounds pretty good.

Attention to the parents' perception of their child's illness and, most important, handling the mother's expectations of the medical visit in word or deed significantly increase satisfaction. In the total sample, 76 percent of the patients were satisfied and 42 percent were highly compliant with medical advice, the authors reported. Noncompliance was only partly ex- plained by interaction data, but other explanations, such as the strength of the health threat presented by a particular illness, have contributed to noncompliance, they concluded. Philadelphia Pharmacists Are Health Educators Too Among the professionals who can contribute significantly to the pro- motion of public health is the com- munity pharmacist. With his broad and varied education and training, the pharmacist can assume various roles in public health work. Public health education marks the public health era perhaps more than any other single activity, and this ap- pears to be the means by which the practicing pharmacist can contrib- ute most, in the opinion of Arnold L. Snyder, Pharmacy Health Council of Philadelphia, and William A. Allen, Philadelphia Department of Public Health. The pharmacist occu- pies a unique position in this regard, they went on, because it is to him as a health advisier who can be un- derstood and who is understanding that niany people turn for guidance concerning health problems. The Pharmacy Health Council of Philadelphia, a federation of local pharmacy organizations and the two pharmacy schools in Philadelphia, was established in 1965 in recogni- tion of the fact that an informed public is an essential factor in the stimulation and maintenance of com- munity health programs and that the primary source of such advisement must be professionals. The council's goal is the active involvement of pharmacists in the mainsitream of public health programs at the com- munity level, the authors reported. The council formed a citywide netwo,rk of health information and referral centers in neighborhood pharmacies in the interest of more effective person-to-person communi- cation. This system has enabled the pharmacists to participiate in many health education activities, soime of which are: inform their patrons ab,out available services at the health department and make appropriate re- ferrals; assist in the distribution of health education literature, such as literature on venereal disease aimed at teenagers; advise the public on the increasing hazards of the misuse and abuse of drugs; promote annual tests for cervical cancer; participate in a campaign to stress the importance of early prenatal care in prevention of birth defects; and, during "Poison Prevention Week" advise the public on how to poison proof a house and present fire department rescue squad vehicles with properly labeled syrup of ipecac, which is vital as a first-aid measure in most cases of accidental poisoning. Plans are underway for a project using pharmacists in chro-nic disease control and health promotion, which has been endorsed by many of Phila- delphia's health agencies, according to the authors. One feature of the project is the use of pharmacy stu- dents in community health education tasks. The authors concluded that the success of the council's continuing community action program is based on a united front, volunteerism, and involvement, plarticularly with the underprivileged, to more fully utilize the professional manpower of phar- macy in the pharmacist's role as a public health and personal health educator. Public Health Nursing Favorable Attitudes Offset By Cultural Influences Although weight control was em- phasized more 'than other instruc- tions, 73 percent of the control patients and 53 percent of the experi- mental patients from a sample of 80 Negro primigravidae gained more weight than their physicians recom- mended, reported Marie L. Lowe, of 'the University of North Carolina's School of Public Health, Chapel Hill. She described a study of compliance with medical recommendations 'to women admitted 'during their first trimester to one clinic. The patients were blindly and randomly assigned to either group, she exiplained. The control group re- ceived only routine clinic care. The experimental group was referred for public healith nursing service in addi- tion to their clinic care. Increasing demands on public health nursing necessitates assessing results of current practice, and com- pliance with instructions is a criter- ion of effective teaching, she said. The patient may learn and comply with instructions, not learn but comply, learn but not comply, or neither learn nor comply, Lowe re- flected. If the patient neither learns nor complies, nursing cannot make a difference. Should instructions given by the physician or nurse be alien to the patient's culture, they may be re- jected. One wonders how much practical use is made by public health nurses of the knowledge of cultural differences between social classes. Compliance may be measured in different ways, she observed. The index used was the change in amount of deviation from phyisi- c-ians' instructions reported between two interviews approximately 5 months apart. The final interview was conducted by Lowe in the ninth month of the pregnancies. The study design did not permit a quantitative test of reliability. A test-retest would have been contam- inated by intervening instructions. Much of the collected data related to eating habits. The southern diet, she explained, contains excessive starch, ample meat (largely pork) usually fried, and few green leafy vegetables. Usually vegetables are overcooked with fat. Excessive weight gain was consid- ered bad by both groups. Neverthe- Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 255</page><page sequence="68">less, both groups reported low intake of milk, green leafy vegeta- bles, lean meat, and cereals but excesisive amounts of pork, fried ineat, vegetables cooked in faits, car- bohydrates, and carbonated drinks, Lowe revealed. The 24 patients lost from the study did not differ in social and demographic characteristics from either the control or experimental groups, so they represented no sys- tematic bias. The observed weight gain was consistent with the re- ported high consumption of fats and carbohydrates. The discrepancy between atti- tudes and reported diet may have been due to the difference between rational knowledge and resistance to change from the patients' long- established eating habits, Lowe stated. Home Visiting Program Benefits Future MD's If, as physicians, medical students are to grasp their role in providing comprehensive care, they must de- velop awareness of the patient in his total environment and learn to work with professionals in nonmedical disciplines. These assertions were made by Jocelyn T. Mitchell and Eleanor Krimerman, Louisiana State University M edical Center, New Orleans. who described a home visit- ing program for medical students. Premedical education is grossly deficient in behavioral sciences and loaded with physical and biological sciences, they declared, and medical students are more "body oriented" than "people oriented." The Home Visiting Program An experimental program was established at Louisiana State Uni- versity Medical Center to teach use of commiiunity facilities by giving medical students an understanding of patients' ecologic situation from the perspective of the patient and his family. Students were taught by and dealt with a public health nurse and a social worker. Junior students have participated in the program for the last 2 years, the authors recalled. While doing their psychiatry clinic practice, stu- dents w-ork wTith the falmnily of a patient fromii the psychiatric clinic of Charity Hospital in New Orleains. The f amilies visited were selected by screeniing patients the student had seenl in Charity Hospital's outpatient clinic, the auithors explained. The screeninig was suipervised by staff p)sychiatrists anid the public health nurse faculty member. Specific ob- jeetives were established and dis- cussed w-ith the student. Mitchell accompanied students during home visits, but the student was respon- sible for handling the interview. AWhen the patient returned to the cliniic, the authors continiued, infor- ination from the interview was given to the psychiatric faculty supervisor, and recomlmendations were made for therapy and therapeutic goals or ap- propriate dispositions. Theory and practicum iwere correlated at post- visit conferences. The students con- tactecl community agencies and implemented referrals. Evaluation and Evolution Students apparenitly had difficulty reorieniting from physical diagnosis to making a family diagnosis. There- fore a 2-year comparative study was made of the studenlts' ability to ob- serve and follow through by stating objectives, making observation-s, then interpretations, and recommending interventions. The 1966-67 data shows 91 percent of the students observed the patient's housing conditions and in 1967-68, 89.4 percent of the students made the same observations, Mitchell and Krimermalu reported. Students' un- derstanding of "descriptive observa- tion without interpreitation" did not inielude description of behavior. In 1966-67 the students' second place observation was the appear- ance of the neighborhood, and they attempted to aszess its contributory effect on the patient. In 1967-68 the second place category of observa- tions was "interaction with patient and family members," with 81.5 per- cent followed by 68 percent in the "'neighborhood and its description" category. The first year's teaching, they said, consisted mainly of lectures on com- munity resources. In the second year, class time was increased from 1 to 2 hours a week anid a psychiatric social worker added to the teaching staff. She also superviseid followup and referral by students. Additional course content included ecologic sys- tems review, an introduction to con- cepts of human ecology, family psychodynamics, epidemiology of suicide and suicide prevention, and legal aspects of the medicine-nursing function. The Outlook and Results More formally organized teaching to sharpen the observational skills of medical students is needed, the au- thors observed. It is much more diffi- cult to evade the "total human being" if one has seen him in his home, met his relatives, seen him either hungry or broke, ior viewed the mental, physical, or social illnesses in his family. Only a few students rec- ognized the importance of political and religious processes. Students iniereased their aware- ness of the functions and capabilities of persons in supportive disciplines by working with nurses, public health workers, and social workers. Being supervised, tested, and taught by persons from other disciplines in- duced changes in their attitudes. Nursing has been presented with the challenge of moving from within itself and communicating across dis- ciplinary lines, Mitchell and Krimer- man declared. Pediatricians Would Assign Office Nurses PH Duties Most of the patient-care tasks which physicians would delegate to their office nurses have been done for many years by public health nurses under circumstances far less favorable than those in private pediatric practice. This observation was made by Dr. Alfred Yankauer, Dr. John P. Connelly, anid Dr. Jacob J. Feldman of the Harvard School of Public Health in their discussion of a survey to ascertain practices and opinions pertaining to the use of allied health workers by fellows of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The response rate was 88 percent. Nonrespondents were not concen- trated in any geographic area or 256 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="69">State, but they were older thani respondents and less likely to be practicin-g. One-fifth of the respond- ents were practicing in a multispe- ciialty group. Queries conicerned 40 specific tasks representative of all tasks in ambu- latory patient care. Tasks with highest priorities were giving infor- mation, taking histories or making home visits, and counseling. Delegation of Tasks If a registered nurse is employed in a practice setting, the authors reported, delegation of patient care- taking is substantially increased. Once the practice employs two or more workers-one of whom is a nurse-delegation frequency does not change. The more physicians associated in the praetice, the more allied health workers were employed in the office. The authors observed that the frequency of physician task delegation increased in direct rela- tionship to the number of workers employed. Although more nonprofessional personnel became available as the total numbers of employees in the offlce increased, technical tasks- such as immunizations and paren- teral therapy-were apt to be done by professional nurses. The regis- tered nurse was used more frequently than all other health workers com- bined for taking blood pressure and giving injections. Registered nurses were used ex- tensively for clerical, laboratory, and technical tasks, the authors re- ported, but not in preference to other workers when such workers were available. Patient-care tasks were less apt to be delegated to any health worker, but when delegated, these tasks were most likely to be as- signed to registered nurses. The number of health workers employed in the practice affects the delegation of technical, clerical, and laboratory tasks more strongly than the delegation of patient-care tasks, the authors noted. For patient-care tasks, no effect beyond two or more employees could be demonstrated. Patient-care task delegation also de- pended strongly on the presence of one or more professional nurses. The authors observed a contrast between the relatively few respond- ents who delegated patient-care tasks and the two-thirds who said they would do so if capable person- nel were available. A large nmajority of physicians said they would hire ancillary personnel and that their use would increase the volume or improve the quality of pediatric care or do both. These physicians per- ceived greater use of allied health workers as the most important sin- gle change in practice that would lead to greater efflciency. General Observations Reported nursing shortages are distorte;d by maldistribution and mis- use of professional nurses and by their high professional dropout rate, the authors stated. Eight percent of the active registered nurses in 1966 were employed in physicians' offices. Of the 254 graduates of advanced programs in 1966-67, only 48 were prepared for maternal and child health nursing practice. The history of professional nurs- ing has been linked to hospitals. Were all school nurses and all public health nurses considlered pediatric nurses, the ratio of such a total nurse group to pediatricians in of- fice practice would be substantially lower than the hospital nurse to physiciani ratio. Well-baby care, district home visit- ing, school health, and other categor- ically determined handicaps tend to fragment the child, the family, and the community, the authors asserted. Traditional pfrogram boundaries in- hibit the dialogue between nurse and physician and preclude clinical care- taking by nurses within a conmpre- hensive medical setting. In Boston, the authors continued, an abbreviated training program has been launched for registered nurses whose work demands an expanded patient-care role. Knowledge, skills, and basic understanding of human development and culture required of a pediatric nurse practitioner are similar whether she is in a suburban middle class practice or delivering comprehensive care to the urban poor. As the program develops, the authors hope that nursing dropouts will be attracted back into practice. Like hospital and office nurses, the authors declared, the services of the public health nurse have been more closely linked to institutional needs and programs of agencies than to taking care of patients. The stereo- type of office nurses as quasi-secre- taries should not prejudice the care- taking potential of the pediatric nurse practitioner in office practice. Communicable Disease Research Offers New Hope For Control of Meningitis Knowledge that serum antibodies to meningococci develop in healthy carriers has opened the door for con- sideration of immunizing agents against meningitis and several re- lated clinical entities. This knowl- edge is potentially the most impor- tant resuilt of recent research on the meningococci, according to Dr. Robert 0. Peckinplaugh and co-work- ers of the Naval Medical Research Unit No. 4, Great Lakes, Ill. The ap- parent difference in the asisociation of serogroups and clinical cases may ,assist in selecting an immunizing agent, added the authors. Two other recent developments that the authors said have given new meaning to the understanding of the meningococci are the identifi- cationi of new serogroups and the definition of the sensitivity of menin- gocoeci to sulfadiazine as an epi- demiologic tool. The role that the Boshard group (also called "Y," "E," or "F") plays in the epidemiology of the meningococci at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center ha's been liden- tified. The roles of other distinct new groups, 29E, Z, X, and 135, are re- ported by the authors. Twenty-two percent of the re- cruits arriving at the training cen- ter carry meningococci. Upon grad- uation 9 weeks later, 57 percent are carriers, Peckinpaugh and co-au- Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 257</page><page sequence="70">thors stated. Upon arrival, most re- cruits receive 1 gram of sulfadiazine twice daily for 2 days to eradicate sulfadiazine-sensitive strains. (Sen- sitive strains are those inhibited by 1 mg. of sulfadiazine per 100 ml. or less of diluent, the authors ex- plained.) When recruits arrive, only 12 percent of the strains are resistant to sulfadiazine (require more than 1 mg. per 100 ml. to inhibit growth). At graduation, 91 percent of the strains are resistant, and the pre- dominant group is Boshard, the car- rier state of which is at least asso- ciated with clinical cases. This would iappear to be a good exchange, the authors commented. When cases representing disease states are related to the estimated carriers of serogroups, the ratio of Boshard cases to Boshard carriers is 1 to 18,000, according to Peck- inipaugIh and co-authors. The ratio of cases to carriers for groups B and C is approximately 1 to 2,000. The authors call the availability of serologic *tests "the most exciting development" in recent research on the meningococci. There is a definite relationship, they said, between the acquisition of meningococci by healthy carriers and seroconversions (see figure). Seroconversion follows the first positive culture by an aver- age of 8?/2 to 10 days. This relation- ship has been established on a longi- tudinal basis by both complement fixation and indirect henmagglutina- tion tests. In the diseaise state, the authors pointed out, seroconversions occur even when the patient is un- der intensive therapy. Epidemiologic studies can now be carried out in depth, the authors conclude, with the new hope that more intensive efforts may lead to the control or prevention of the dread disease of meningitis. HPV-77 Rubella Vaccines Prove Highly Effective Three experimental rubella vac- cines derived from the HPV-77 strain showed an efficacy of 93-95 percent in field itests on elementary school boys on the island of Taiwan. (Boys who received vaccine during the in- cubation period of the natural dis- ease are not included in the percent- age base.) In reporting this result, Dr. J. T. Grayston, department of preventive medicine, University of XVashington, Seattle, and co-authors noted that the last rubella epidemic on Taiwan had occurred in 1957-58. Between epi- demics, rubella is not endemic, the authors said, and children born af- ter 1958 have been shown to be sero- negative for rubella. In the 1968 field tests (which were undertaken after rubella cases had already begun to appear), more than 3,000 doses of the vaccines, with 2,000 doses of placebo, were given at random to school boys in grades 1 through 4 in two schools in Taipei and two in Taichung. The combined enrollments in these schools in the four grades was 15,000. Protection Vaccines Gave Beginning 3 weeks after immuni- zation, only 50 rubella cases were diagnosed among the 3,269 boys who received one of the three HPV-77 vaccines. Thrice weekly surveillance for rash disease in the placebo and the uninoculated children showed, by the end of June, cumulative at- tack rates of more than 50 percent in Taipei and 20 percent in Taichung. Among boys receiving vaccine, there was a sharp drop in rash cases be- tween 2 and 3 weeks after inocula- tion. The figure shows, by week after immunization, the attack rates in the Taipei schools for the combined vac- cine groups and for *the boys re- ceiving placebo.

However, only 22 per- cent of the children immunized with the vaccine grown in lmonkey kidney cells were rubella positive. Under the conditions of the study, only the vac- cine groiwn in monkey kidney cell culture was shown to protect against subelinical infection. The ability of the other two vaccines to protect against suibelinical infection will re- main in dou-bt, saidd Grayston and co-authors, until further study with a longer interval between inoculation and challenge. Adverse Reactions Three serious reactions occurred within 5 to 10 minutes of injections of the dog kidney vaccine. All three boys experienced marked pallor, ab- sent peripheral pulses, were cold and clammy to the touch, sweated pro- fusely, and became unconscious. Breathing was depressed, and in one boy wheezing was noted. All three boys, however, responded within 1 to 2 minutes to subcutaneous epineph- rine. Three weeks after the reac- tions, serums from two of the boys failed to show evidence of circulat- ing antibody. The pathogenesis of the reactions remains unknown, said the authors, but appears to be spe- cific to dog kidney vaccine. There were no adverse reactions of any kind following injection of the other two vaccines. Outbreak of Gastroenteritis Related to Water Pollution Outbreaks of waiterborne disease are a relatively infrequent public health problem despite water pollu- tion, commented Dr. Harvey H. Bor- den and co-authors. Borden is a medical officer of the Heart Disease and Stroke Control Program, Public Health Service, currently assigned to the School of Medicine, State Uni- versity of New York at Buffalo, and Erie County Department of Health. Nevertheless, said the authors, widespread gastroenteritis that was reported to the Erie Coiunty Health Department in June 1968 seems to have been caused by polluted water. The outbreak of disease occurred among people living in and around a small village near Buffalo. Prelim- inary investigation by public health nurses revealed a significant amount of illness in the population. The drinking water of the affected popu- lation was found to be unusual in color, taste, and odor. A survey of a random sample of 622 persons in the area revealed that 184 persons were ill-an attack rate of 30 percent, compared with 8 per- cent among 157 randomly selected controls residing north of the vil- lage, who used water from a differ- ent supply system. In general terms, the illness occurred in one of every three persons and in one of every two households in the affected area. Information on the quality of water, milk, and food, and on the severity, date of onset, duration, and character of the illnesses was ob- tained by questionnaire from all per- sons in the surveyed households. The date of onset was determined for 170 of the 184 ill persons. Stool specimens from 32 of the ill patients and samples of water from multiple sources in the supply system were analyzed for bacteriological, viro- logical, and chemical content. Local physicians, hospitals, nursing homes, and public schools were also sur- veyed to determine the magnitude and severity of the outbreak. Symptoms of the illness were mainly abdominal pain, nausea, and Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 259 331-830-69- 6</page><page sequence="72">diarrhea of 48-72 hours duration. There were no areas of clustering or absence of the disease, and all age groups were affected. The water for the affected area came from Lake Erie. It was proc- essed at a water treatment plant by rapid sand filtration, sedimentation, and presuperchlorination. This plant was located about a half mile south of a local sewage treatment plant that emptied refuse into a nearby creek. The creek, in turn, flowed into Lake Erie at a point a half-mile north of the intake system of the water treatment plant. The results of analysis of the stool specimens of 32 ill persons were neg- ative. The symptoms may have represented a systemic reaction to some nonspecific bacterial floral or bacterial toxin not identifiable through routine bacteriological or chemical examination, explained Borden and co-authors. This explana- tion is probable, they observed, since the chemical analysis of water sam- ples revealed that the water came from a creek which might have been contaminated by the local sewage plant. Icing on Lake Erie allowed water to flow under ice from the creek outlet southward toward the intake system of the water plant. Also, the water treatment plant lacked automatic recording and chlorinating equipment so that sew- age-contaminated water possibly was underchlorinated at times. Orders to boil all water and the shutting off of the suspect water supply caused a rapid end to the ill- ness (see figure), the authors reported. Preschoolers Hit Hardest In Measles Epidemic Preschool children accounted for three-fourths of the reported cases of measles in an epidemic that occurred in Chicago during the win- ter of 1967-68. This unusual age distribution helps explain why an intensive school immunization cam- paign failed to abort promptly the epidemic, stated Dr. George E. Hardy, Jr., Immunization and Epide- miology Programs, National Com- municable Disease Center, Public Health Service, and co-authors. Measles cases in Chicago, the authors said, are reported by hospi- tals and physicians-not by schools. Since January 1967, the Chicago Board of Health has attempted to investigate all cases reported. The characterization of the 1967-6S out- break, they said, rests on data obtained by field investigators for the Chicago Board of Health, medical offlcers of the U.S. Public Health Service Epidemiologic Intelligence Service, and public health advisers. Case Distribution by Age A totial of 1,386 cases of measles were recorded in Chicago during the winter of 1967-68; 1,029 of these were officially reported. Of the 1,295 cases in which the patient's age was known, 72 percent occurred in chil- dren under 5 years. Among the 367 ill children 5 years or older, 92 per- cent were between 5 and 10. To determine whether the age dis- tribution of the children with re- ported cases was representative, families of 372 of the ill children were reinterviewed, and 409 unre- ported cases were discovered. The proportion of the 409 cases in chil- dren under 5 was almost identical with that for the children with the reported cases. By January 1968, the authors said, cases had spread from the city's center to 46 of Chicago's 75 com- munity areas. Seventy percent of the areas reported measles at some time during the epidemic; however, five lower socioeconomic areas recorded 55 percent of the total cases. These areas accounted for only 12 percent of Chicago's 1960 population. These five areas are popuLlated primarily by Negroes from the rural South, whites from Appalachia, and Puerto Rican immigrants. Nonwhite persons ac- counted for 72 percent of the total cases, the authors pointed out. Immunization Program Approximately 25,000 doses of live attenuated measles virus vaccine were distributed by the board of health to many of Chicago's schools between September 1967 and Feb- ruary 1968. In February 1968, an intensive measles immunization program was conducted, in which 34,691 additional doses were admin- istered to kindergarten and first- through third-grade pupils.

This im- munization program did not im- mediately halt the epidemic, com- mented the authors, although there was a gradual decline in cases dur- ing February and March 1968. Among the preschoolers, chains of transmission were documented through three and four generations of cases. This mode of spread was particularly marked, Hardy and co- authors noted, among residents of high-rise urban-renewal dwellings where preschool children were found to congregate with common baby- sitters and at crowded recreational facilities. Such communal habits per- mitted close enough contact to allow continued spread of measles in this young population. Significant trans- mission among preschool children, an unusual observation, explains the inability of a school immunization program to terminate the epidemic, explained the authors. Hardy and co-authors concluded that a complete assessment of the epidemiologic characteristics of an outbreak, including the patterns of its spread, should be undertaken be- fore a decision is reached as to the method of control. Enterovirus Infections In New York State Important data on infections in- duced by the enteroviruses in a large population have been provided by studies in New York State, exclusive of New York City, covering the past 10 years. Dr. Hildegard Plager, Di- vision of Laboratories and Research, New York State Department of Health, presented a cross section of the infections reported in the studies, with special attention to those caused by Coxssackie virus A16. Coxsackie A16 Illness arising from Coxsackie A16 infection is generally mild, sel- dom lasting longer than 1 week, ac- cording to Plager. Children, espe- cially in the 2- to 9-year iage group, are mos,t often affected. The incu- bation period is approximately 3 to Percent with serum titers - 32 Coxsackie virus Patients Controls (N=90) (N=68) B1- 11 10 B2 -14 10 B3 -8 0 B4 -22 9 B5 -17 4 5 days. The illness starts with low- gra,de fever. Small vesicles, which have a tendency to ulcerate, develop in the pharynx, soft palate, buccal mucosa, gingivae, and tongue. Vesi- cles also appear on the dorsa of the hands and feet and occasionally on the palms and soles and, in small children, on the buttock. Severe in- fections, such as paralytic disease resembling poliomyelitis, have been reported. Coxsackie A16 can be iso- lated from feces, throat washings, and lesions in newborn mice and in tissue culture. Coxsackie A16 had been occasion- ally isolated in New York State be- fore 1907, said the author, but in 1967 and 1968 it caused small epi- demics of hand, foot, and mouth dis- ease in the State. In some instances, it affected an entire family. In the summer of 1968, she reported, the enterovirus infection season started earlier than usual-at the end of June-and it lasted through August. Mostly younger children were af- fected, but older children and adults who were in close contact with sick children also became ill. Complica- tions were not reported. An outbreak caused by ECHO virus type 30 with typical manifesta- tion of abacterial meningitis fol- lowed the Coxsackie A16 epidemic very closely. In general, adults were affected. Cardiopathy andl Coxsackie We are now engaged, commented Plager, in an investigation of cardiopathy associated with the Coxsackie viruses. Specimens fro,m 90 patients with a recent diagnosis of myocarditis or pericarditis have been examined. From 68 asymptomatic persons, 97 serums were examined to serve as controls. Serum titers of 1 to 32 or higher for one or more Cox- sackie B antigens were found in 54 percent of the patients with cardi- opathy as compared with 28 percent of the controls (see table). Titers to Coxsackie virus B3, B4, and B5 were more frequent in the patients than the controls. Sixty-two of the patients were male and 28 female. The majority were less than 10 years of age; one was under 1 year. Twenty patients were more than 40; the oldest was 65. There was no seasonal preference, although the enterovirus season is sharply re- stricted to late summer and fall. Chronic Disease QRS Axis Deviation May Be Predictor of Heart Disease The QRS axis measurement and its relationship to clinical disease and various anthropomorphic, phys- iologic, and social variables may be evaluated by epidemiologic tech- niques, according to Dr. Harvey H. Borden, medical officer in the Heart Disease and Stroke Control Pro- gram, Public Health Service, who is assigned to the School of Medicine, State University of New York at Buffalo. To add to the understanding of the mechanisms Involved, he and Dr. Michel A. Ibrahim, deputy com- missioner, Erie County (N.Y.) De- partment of Health, examined and interpreted the associations between the electrocardiographic axis and various risk factors in coronary heart disease, such as elevated levels of blood pressure and serum cholesterol, body weight, and aging in a "free-living" population. In 196 Ibrahim and co-workers studied fathers of 501 white high school students, 36-75 years of age, in a suburban community of Buf- falo. Information on this group in- cluded age, height, weight, blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, smoking habits, and a 12-lead elec- trocardiogram. Values of the meas- Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 261</page><page sequence="74">urements of the QRS axis in this population ranged from -30? to +1200 with a mean of 370, a stand- ard deviation of +260, and a stand- ard error of 1.2. With the apparent bimodality of the QRS axis distri- bution and on the basis of what appeared to be a "natural" popu- lation breakpoint around the me- dian, the QRS axis variable was dichotomized by the researchers into a -300 to +300, or "left-axis devi- ation" group (244 subjects or 48.8 percent), and a +450 to ?120', or "right-axis deviation" group (257 subjects or 51.2 percent). The terms "right or left axis deviation" refer only to directional trends indicat- ing a certain electrophysiologic state and not to a specific pathologic state. The relationship between the QRS axis and six variables-age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol level, ponderal index, and weight gain since age 25-was shown. Each var- iable was subdivided into three levels of magnitude, with approxi- mately equal numbers in each group, and the percent of subjects exhibiting a QRS axis between -30? and +30?, or left-axis devia- tion, was examined, the researchers said. With increasing levels of mag- nitude for all variables examined, a statistically significant shift toward left-axis deviation was found. Since age had an effect, age-specific rates were determined for all other results to control the possible influ- ence of age on each variable's indi- vidual effect, the authors said. These calculations showed that the same statistically significant findings existed for all the variables examined regardless of age. Age-adjusted rates were also computed and revealed a negligible numerical difference from the crude rates reported. Relationships between the QRS axis and smoking habits, quantity of cigarettes smoked, and the number of years of cigarette smoking were examined. Cigar and pipe smokers were excluded from the analysis. Re- sults were shown in terms of the percent of subjects with a QRS axis of +45? to +1200, or right-axis de- viation. There were statistically slgnificant differences in the QRS axis between the nonsmokers, pre- vious smokers, and present smokers. The shift was toward right-axis de- viation, as shown by a rise from 34.5 percent for the nonsmoking group to 54.3 percent for the present smoking group. There was little difference between previous smokers and pres- ent smokers. No statistically signifi- cant differences were revealed for the amount or duration of tobacco use, the researchers reported. Since smoking was found to have an opposite effect on the QRS axis from that of the other variables and since age effect was evaluated in a separate analysis of 'age-specific rates, only serum cholesterol, dia- stolic blood pressure, and ponderal index were examined, utilizing a combined variable analysis. Statistically significant differences in the percent of left-axis deviation were found between those subjects in group 1 who had low diastolic blood pressure, ponderal index, and serum cholesterol (15.1 percent), those in group 2 who had two vari- ables low and one high (52.7 per- cent), those in group 3 who had two variables high and one low (67.5 per- cent), and those in group 4 who were high in all three variables (70 percent). Having further subdivided groups 2 and 3 into six separate populations, the eight subgroups (1; 2 a, b, c; 3 a, b, c; and 4) were examined for their relationship to the QRS axis considering both the number and type of "high-level" variables pres- ent. Examination of each of six pos- sible sequences (groups 1, 2a, 3a, 4, and so forth) revealed both indi- vidual and additive effects for each of the three variables as indicated by a rising percentage of subjects with left-axis deviation. Also, pon- deral index appeared to have the greatest and cholesterol the least quantitative effect in changing the QRS axis toward left-axis deviation when comparing the three variables. The authors said that significant relationships were shown to exist between obesity, blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, and smoking and the measurement of the QRS axis. They pointed out that the in- teraction and dependence of this easily obtained measurement on varn- ous physiologic, anthropomorphic, and social variables related to coro- nary heart disease make the QRS axis deviation a possible predictor of this disease or of the presence of coronary risk factors. "Preventive Effect" Occurs Only After First Diagnosis Prevalence, incidence, annual mor- tality, and death caused by coronary artery disease among 14,092 men who had at least two consecutive medical examinations were analyzed by Dr. Johannes Ipsen, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Retrospective data were collected for the period 1950-64 on managers and executives in large industries and business firms who were exam- ined in eight clinics in the eastern United States, he said. Attention was focused on those with diagnoses of diabetes, hypertension, and coro- nary artery disease. A total of 4,806 men acquired one or more of these conditions and 1,055 men had two or three of these condi- tions. Followup of 98.2 percent of the group was achieved; 663 deaths were recorded by the end of the study period, Ipsen noted. Co-prevalence for each condition was always twice the single preva- lence. Presence of two other condi- tions increased the prevalence of the third condition four times. Ipsen dis- cussed annual incidence using the terms "nonconditioned" (incidence among men without other diagnosis) and "conditioned" (incidence among men with one or two other conditions). Conditioned incidence was about twice as high as nonconditioned in- cidence for eaeh diagnosis, Ipsen re- ported. The presence of two condi- tions did not increase the incidence over that of one condition. Nonconditioned incidence showed no change over the 10 years that the men were given examinations; how- ever conditioned incidence showed a marked decrease among those who had been examined periodically over a longer period of time. This de- crease was particularly notable for hypertension and coronary artery disease, he stated. The mortality ratios (observed-to- 262 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="75">expected deaths) were 3.6 for men with one or two diseases prevalent at first examination and 2.2 for those in whom one or more diseases developed over the period they had been given examinations. Mortality ratios for coronary artery disease were of the order of 7 to 8 among men who had coronary artery dis- ease as a single or multiple diag- nosis at first examination and as high as 3.0 for men without coro- nary artery disease but with dia- betes or hypertension. The corre- sponding ratios were 68 percent lower among men with these diag- noses established at later examina- tions, Ipsen reported. A preventive effect of periodic health examinations seems to occur only when a person has acquired a significant disease, Ipsen said. The prevention then appears in the diminished incidence of those dis- eases with which it is usually co- prevalent. CRD Screening in Industry: Results on 10,000 Workers Feasibility of a mass method for screening in industry was demon- strated by the breathmobile project in which 10,163 workers in Los Angeles County industries were tested. Findings on the project were reported by Dr. David P. Discher, University of California School of Public Health, Los Angeles, and Helen C. Feinberg, Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease Association of Los Angeles County. Methods The breathmobile is a 40-foot trail- er equipped and staffed to administer questionnaires, do electronic spiro- metry, and process minifilm chest X-rays, the authors said. The inter- viewer-administered questionnaire consists of identifying data, pre- screening questions to determine pre- vious diagnoses of chronic respira- tory disease, and seven symptom questions with major and minor lev- els of severity. The bulk of the data in the spirometry test of three to five expiratory efforts is computer proc- essed. The forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1.o) and the forced vital capacity (PVC) are the two measures used in the spirometry. Minifilms are read by both a certified radiologist and a chest specialist. All data are computer processed, and the notification system is com- puterized. The spirometry signal is analog-to-digital converted in the breathmobile. Questionnaire an- swers and minifilm reading pads are precoded for card punching. The software generates three computer punched cards and a high-density digital tape log, Discher and Fein- berg explained. Results The spirometry test yield was 14.1 percent for those exceeding the screening cutoff. The cutoff was based on the "standard" prediction formulas. "Borderline" was the lower 1-5 percent of the "standard" distribution (-1.645 to -2.326 standard deviations); whereas the "abnormal" category was the lowest 1 percent of this distribution (a vol- ume less than 2.326 standard devia- tions below the predicted mean). The yield on the questionnaire was 13.6 percent with one or more major symptoms. Chronic cough was the most prevalent major symptom; 6.3 percent of those not prescreened re- ported it. Almost 10 percent of the minifilms showed suspicious findings, according to the authors. The average PEV1.o was 3.611 liters for men and 2.57 liters for women; average FVC was 4.65 liters for men and 3.21 liters for women. The sex- age-specific rates for spirometry yield showed a rise with the fifth and sixth decade. Age-adjusted rates were higher for those in manufac- turing and service industries com- pared with those in the trade and miscellaneous categories. The authors made regression equatio-n comparisons using sub- groups in the population screened. Based on findings from a subgroup of nonsmokers who volunteered no positive responses on the respiratory symptom questionnaire, they ques- tioned the "standard" for both sexes and both ithe FYC and FEV1.o. In any screening program the spirometry and its recording system should be calibrated and frequently recali- brated for accuracy in its measure- ment of flows and timed volumes, stated Discher and Feinberg. Other more insidious sources of deviation from the "standard" formulas could arise from differences in spirometry technique, characteristics of the "populations," and the data process- ing system, they added. Frequency of "borderline" and "ab- normal" spirometry categories as a function of the questionnaire cate- gories is shown in the table. Cirrhosis Deaths Increase Among 25- to 44-Year-Olds Cirrhosis of the liver was the leading cause of sudden, unexpected, natural deaths in Baltimore in 1964-65 in the 25- to 44-year age group. Dr. Lewis Kuller and Karl Kramer of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and Dr. Russell Fisher, Maryland's Chief Medical Examiner, examined mortality from cirrhosis in the city during a 17-year period. There were 2,817 deaths at- tributed to cirrhosis between 1951 and 1967; 944 were of persons in the Spirometry results by questionnaire category for 10,163 industrial workers in Los Angeles County Spirometry results (percent) Questionnaire category "Borderline" "Abnormal" Total I Normal -6. 9 4. 2 11. 1 Minor -8.7 5. 5 14.2 Major -9. 6 9. 4 19. 0 Prescreened: Chronic asthma, chronic bron- chitis, emphysema, or other CRD -14. 4 12. 5 26.9 Other "serious" disease 9. 6 8. 2 17. 8 Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 263</page><page sequence="76">25-44 age group. The authors also presented data on the 45-54 and 55- 64 age groups but focused their analysis on deaths in the youngest age group. They examined all death certifi- cates of Baltimore residents with cirrhosis of the liver listed as the underlying cause during the 17 years. For 1957-58 and 1965-66, however, they also reviewed the medical examiner's reports, hospital records, and autopsy protocols. Between 1951-52 and 1967 among the 25- to 44-year-olds, there was a 180 percent increase in deaths for white males, a 171 percent increase for white females, a 465 percent in- crease for nonwhite males and a 442 percent increase for nonwhite females. The increase was attributed primarily to the increase in deaths certified by the medical examiner, Kuller and co-workers said. Thirty-two percent of the deaths attributed to cirrhosis of those 25-44 were certified by the medical exam- iner in 1957-58; in 1967 he certified 68 percent of the deaths. The per- centage was higher for men than women and for nonwhites. For the 45-54 age group, the change in cirrhosis death rates was similar for deaths certified and not certified by the medical examiner. The authors compared autopsy findings for 1957 and 1966 on the 25-44 age group. Autopsies had been performed in about 75 percent of all nontraumatic deaths in both years. In 1957 autopsies, diagnoses of cir- rhosis or fatty liver were made in 16 percent of 175 deaths; in 1966 of 241 deaths, 39 percent had such diagnoses at autopsy. Increases in the rates for cirrhosis do not seem to be caused by changes in certifica- tion practices or diagnostic fashions, Kuller and co-workers said. They pointed out that, although the cirrhosis death rates for those 25-44, especially nonwhites, in- creased markedly, the death rate for nonwhites for all causes actually de- clined in the 1951-67 period. They noted that as the deaths for tuber- culosis declined (177 deaths in 1951, 23 in 1966) the rate for cirrhosis increased, although after much of the tuberculosis decline had oc- curred. Perhaps, they speculated, in earlier years the alcoholic died from tuberculosis. Describe New Criteria In Pulmonary Function Test A solution to the difficulties of separating "normal" from "abnor- mal" results in mass screening for chronic pulmonary obstructive dis- ease was offered by K. W. Grimley, Charles N. Adams, and Dr. Robert A. Walton, all of the Alabama Tuber- culosis Association. Their solution is a pulmonary func- tion score developed from a weighted combination of six parameters: forced vital capacity, the percentage of forced expiratory volume pro- duced in the first half-second, the percent achieved of predicted volume at 1 second, the peak flow rate, the maximum mid-expiratory flow rate, and the instantaneous flow when one- half the forced vital capacity has been expired. Prediction values based on age, height, and sex are from formulas developed in Veterans' Administra- tion studies. Scores from 0 through 3- are reported as normal, 3+ through 6 as abnormal. Grimley and co-workers felt their system is better than the single meas- ure of forced expiratory volume dur- ing the first second, the measure most screening programs now use. They pointed out that if the common criterion of abnormality, a forced ex- piratory volume during 1 second of less than 70 percent of the predicted volume, had been applied in one sur- vey of 4,238 men, there would have been a false positive rate of 5.5 per- cent and a false negative rate of 3.1 percent. In the Alabama program spi- rometry tests (two trials of a single breath forced expiratory spirogram) and X-rays are made in a 28-foot con- verted mobile home. Subjects com- plete a 1-page questionnaire. Spi- rometry data are digitalized and re- corded on magnetic tape. Punched Hollerith cards, the tape, readings on the photoifluorograms, question- naire summaries, and certain other information are stored in an IBM 7040 computer, they stated. The computer evaluates the pul- monary function results on the basis of two components of the pulmonary function score-the volume score and the fraction volume, or the flow rates score, or both. The composite pul- monary function score is the sum of the two subscores. The printout includes a scatter diagram of an approximation of the flow volume loop to aid the review- ing physician in rapid evaluation of the compiuter results. The printout also indicates by symbol the proper form letter to be sent to the screenee. Grimley and co-workers noted that not only is pulmonary function screening more complicated and frus- trating than simple chest X-rays for tuberculosis, but it is also more ex- pensive, about $2 per screenee as compared with 75 cents per chest X-ray. Peptic Ulcer Increasing Among Those Under 16 Peptic ulcer among children is being diagnosed with increasing fre- quency was the conclusion from a study of this condition among those under 16 years of age in Erie County, N.Y., by Dr. Harry A. Sultz, School of Medicine, State University of New York at Buffalo, and co-workers. A total of 106 cases including five deaths were found in a survey of hos- piltal records for a 16-year period. Records of pediatricians, allergists, and 'other appropriate specialists were also surveyed. Demographic and social data were obtained in 28 home interviews. The investigators found an in- creasing trend in annual incidence rates-the 3-year average annual in- cidence rate rose from 0.5 per 100,000 children in 1947-49 to 3.9 in 1956-58, then declined slightly to 3.5 for 1959- 61. Incidence of peptic ulcer was 1.2 per 100,000 for infants. Among 1- to 4-year-olds the rate was lowest, 0.5, and increased sharply to 13.7 for 15-year-olds. The overall ratio of boys to girls was 1.6 to 1. Greater incidence in boys did not occur until age 10; more than half the girls were diagnosed before age 10. 264 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="77">Relationship of peptic ulcer to so- cioeconoimiic status was assessed by census tract of the child's residence. Boys from the highest social class appear to be at greater risk to pep- tic ulcer than boys from middle and low classes. Among girls there was no variation in incidence by social class. The stress factor in the etiology of peptic ulcer was tested in the home interviews, the authors said. Mothers of 25 percent of the chil- dren with the diagnosis indicated that their marital relationship had been deteriorating. Parents of 11 children were of different religious backgrounds. In 18 families there was a history of peptic ulcer; nine on the fa- ther's side, five on the mother's side, and four on both sides. Although the familial pattern on this condition has been demonstrated among those over 18, our findings indicate the same pattern exists throughout childhood, said the authors. Whether the increase of peptic ulcer among children reflects a greater awareness of the condition or is a real increase or a combina- tion of both factors remains unan- swered, Sultz and co-workers stated. Our findings seem to support the thesis that increased stress on chil- dren in modern urban society may be an ulcer-causing factor, they said. Alcoholism Problem Moving From Clink to Clinic I would rather see alcoholics wel- come as patients in a variety of health and social facilities than see enough alcoholism treatment units to handle all alcoholics, declared Ralph Daniel, chief of the Michigan Department of Public Health's alco- holism program. I shudder when I see alcohologists demanding funds to enable them to meet the economic, emotional, physical, vocational, social, spiritual, and legal needs of their alcoholic clients, he said. There are other ex- perts better qualified to do these jobs. Daniel differentiated between the responsibilities of the State and the local health unit. The major concern of local units must be alcoholics; they make the actual contacts. State and national units must be primarily concerned with alcoholism and relate it to the total social and health milieu. States must weigh the good treatment of one alcoholic today against the good treatment of many tomorrow in allocating finan- cial support and program funds. Comprehensive health planning for alcoholism, Daniel said, would acknowledge that alcoholism is a public health problem, but not ex- clusively so. Public health should use its resources to encourage all health and social givers to serve alcoholics. We must promote serv- ices and educate people that we do not control. We must stimulate services that we do not operate. In discussing the financing of treatment, he pointed out tha,t the average alcoholic is not destitute, yet we build programs as If all alco- holics were medically indigent. We should plan treatment programs in which patients who can pay for service do so and we should use welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid sources for those unable to pay, he urged. Daniel outlined the development of Michigan's alcoholism program which grew from four local pro- grams in 1953 to 25 programs today. These involve eight health depart- ments, 11 hospitals, 10 nonprofit corporations, one university, and one municipality. The State unit is now ready to set standards and is in a period of evaluation and standardizaition. He also commented on the U. S. Supreme Court's decision in Powell v. State of Texas. In his opinion, the five judges were saying that the disease concept of alcoholism is not mature enough and the health re- sources are not ready, and until these things change, we cannot jus- tify the abandonment of punishment for alcoholics. We are slightly less than halfway through the task of recognizing alcoholism as a major health and social problem, he opined. Health Planning Road to Responsive Planning Is Sometimes Rocky Some of the very real problems that we have encountered in our sin- cere efforts to proceed with com- prehensive health planning under Public Law 89-749, although of gen- eral concern, seem to be particularly related to our agency, said Dr. Ellen Z. Fifer, director of compre- hensive health planning, State Plan- ning Agency, St. Paul, Minn. First, the problem of demands for responsive planning versus com- prehensive long range planning. We call the function "responsive plan- ning" for obvious reasons, Fifer con- tinued. The problem is in being comprehensive and long range-on the one hand considering all pos- sible alternatives with their costs, benefits, and feasibility and on the other hand being available, respon- sive, and problem solving. "It is a puzzlement," Fifer ;declared. We have attempted to perform both functions, but because this is a legis- lative year (1969) the responsive function is taking precedence over comprehensive long range planning. The second problem is that por- tion of the law which states that 51 percent of the advisory councils, both State and regional, must be so- called consumers of health services. The most immediately available con- sumer, the hospital trustee, is al- ready involved and somewhat knowledgeable about health affairs and even a little bit knowledge- able about planning. He usually has business experience, believes in cor- porate planning, and is willing to endorse the concept of hospital plan- ning if it does not interfere with the plans of his hospital. But how can we involve others who are less experienced in the func- tion of being on boards: the house- wife, the low-income worker, and the resident of the inner city? Is the idea Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 265</page><page sequence="78">of involving the consumer of serv- ices, particularly the consumer of our city hospital services, well-baby clinics, and new health centers a workable idea or is it a political gimmick dreamed up by those who will never have to put it into prac- tice? Board members of other voluntary organizations, almost !always advo- cates of a particular disability group, are also consumers who have an interest in health planning. If the advocate groups are somewhat balanced and their influence is equal- ized, they may tend in times of neces- sity to become involved and inter- ested in other problems. Perhaps we could acquire trade-offs a's in other negotiations: "If you will support the request for residential care for the retarded, I will support halfway houses for the alcoholic." For representation of minorities on State advisory councils, we have included people who have given lead- ership to minority groups; for ex- ample, the Urban League. Further involvement should be sought in the areawide planning councils and in the planning of specific programs, such as community health centers. I can honestly state, said Fifer, that at the State level we have not included the poor although we have attempted to include representatives of the poor. Whether these repre- sentatives would be acceptable to the poor is difficult to say. The third issue Fifer discussed was Federal-State relationships. Does such a relationship constitute a partnership? Sometimes I have found my Federal "partner" on the opposite side of the issue, and then it appears that the Federal bureaucra- cy loses its sense of proportion and any concept of partnership, kshe said. For example, in the 1967 amend- ments to Public Law 90-174 (con- cerning areawide planning agencies) the Congress requested that there be "appropriate representation of the interests of local government." This is a reasonable addition and surely a local governmental official could be added to the board of each areawide planning organization. But interpreting this to mean that a formal resolution of endorsement be obtained from every significant county and municipality within the area that is to be organized is ex- cessively restrictive. The relatively few areawide agencies now operat- ing attest to the difficulty of meeting many of the criteria. Under provisions relating to civil service, why is the staff of agencies like ours required to be under the merit system while the staff of the regional medical program-estab- lished the same year by the same Congress- is entirely outside of its jurisdiction? This requirement has left us at a marked disadvantage in recruiting personnel. The Federal system is not designed for partnership and can present it only in a conceptual framework rath- er than work for it in a practical operational way. With an over- whelming financial and staffing ad- vantage, it has developed a dominance in health affairs that it will not relinquish gracefully or otherwise. I do not present these problems as permanent obstacles, said Fifer, but only as impediments in the way of a new endeavor. They make the job harder and undoubtedly have slowed the achievement of the few objectives that have been estab- lished. Many of us have held and still hold high hopes for ithe compre- hensive health planning program, Fifer remarked. One Sin of Omission Is Exclusion Twenty-one U.S. communities ex- pressing a desire to conduct a self- study were selected by the National Commission on Community Health Services to receive Commission as- sistance, reported Dr. Robert N. Wil- son, professor and chairman, depart- ment of mental health, University of North Carolina School of Public Health. The osingle most important partici- pant, said Wilson, was the study co- ordinator, whose talent, energy, and local institutional background proved to be absolutely critical to a rigorous study. Probably next in significance was the chairman of the steering committee, typically a layman drawn from the business sector. He was in- fluential in recruiting other lay and professional participation and in creating a favorable public image of the health study efforts. Political leaders were least repre- sented among the categories, Wilson said. Usually the mixture of partici- pants was diverse, and recruitment tended to be early in the life of the project. The quality of staff participation was exceedingly important, remarked Wilson. Without an energetic study coordinator who had ready access to local leaders and to supporting serv- ices, a study just would not "go." The inclusion of economic leaders also seemed critical. Not only were participants from business and in- dustry effective by mere presence, lending their skills in analysis and planning, but they also served as style leaders, as imitable models for broader inclusion of citizens. They made the health study a major local effort in the eyes of others. The role of staff representatives and consultants from the Commission emphasized to us that the local com- munity does not and cannot stand alone, Wilson said. In our zeal for local autonomy and our faith in vol- untary participation of citizens, it is well for us to realize that every community is connected in multiple ways to regional and national sys- tems of action, he remarked. A bus- tling local participation in health planning is unlikely to emerge wvith- out some outside stimulus such as the Commission afforded, and is un- likely to be effective without some form of expert consultation, which often comes from an outside source. Participation in the studies was heavily qualified by the organiza- tional pattern in which it took place, Wilson said. Sheer involvement was complemented, in our more success- ful studies, by a shrewd grasp of or- ganization on the part of the study leaders. Timing, communications, the composition of agenda, and goals- all required exquisite managerial talents; otherwise, a great gush of citizen energy and fine feeling could not be harnessed in the service of health action. We might ask, said Wilson, who did not participate-who was left out of the typical self-study group? 266 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="79">The answer unfortunately is obvious, he remarked: virtually everyone who was not a member of the upper or middle class layers of the local heir- archy. The poor, the black, the blue collar workers, and the modestly ranked white collar employee were almost totally excluded. Such ex- clusion was not a deliberate slight, declared Wilson. It was a sin of omis- sion, springing directly from the initial concentration of the studies on the structure of established leadership. We cannot estimate what effect this limited participation will have on the long range results, he said, but the effect is not likely to be positive. Although the National Commission self-studies exhibited some remark- able success, concluded Wilson, they showed the flaw of being grounded on the theory of elite participation. Why Not Permit Pluralistic Health Planning? Comprehensive health planning and regional medical programing are processes in which a society de- cides (a) how much of its total re- sources will be spent for health pur- poses and (b) what priorities will be established to determine how these resources will be spent. These deci- sions seem too broad to be made by any one profession and therefore re- quire siociopolitical decision making, said Dr. Charles E. Lewis, profes- sor and chairman, department of pre- ventive medicine and community health, University of Kansas Medical Center. Public Law 89-239, for regional medical programs, is a fascinating and perhapis the coolest-in the Mc- Luhan sense of the word-example of health legislation that has ever been passed, Lewis declared. It is so cool and unstructured that many groups have difficulty in leaving it alone. During the past year, numer- ous attempts have been made to "hot it up" by earmarking funds for spe- cific diseases and segments of the community. If trends continue, he said, it should be completely "thawed out" by the end of the 91st Congress. From a purely categorical view of the law, it is hard to imagine how three more difficult diseases than heart, cancer, and stroke could have been selected for attack under this law, Lewis declared. We know little of their etiology or methods for pri- mary prevention and have cause to question the value of early diagnosis and current treatment for some of these diseases. Lewis said that thou- sands of lives probably could be saved if all available diagnostic techniques were applied on a nonvol- untary basis and if all probably ef- fective treatments were enforced so that the compliance of patients would not be an issue. Conflicting Interests There are many different opinions as to how the improved organization and delivery of services that could result from regionalization should be accomplished. These differences are to be expected, Lewis remarked, since all parties involved have vested interests to protect or different value systems for health. Generally the ob- jectives reflect the values of the es- tablishments that defined them, he said. The fact that controversies are common supports the proposition ad- vanced earlier that while all groups concerned with health care (hospital planning groups, organized medicine, voluntary health agencies, welfare interests, and others) may share the same goals, their objectives, and particularly their immediate objec- tives, and the means of reaching their goals represent quite different points of view on proper methods. The possibility of several different but equally effective approaches to comprehensive health planning is ex- tremely difficult for certain profes- sionals, particularly physicians, to accept, Lewis asserted. Lewis' examination of 23 opera- tional regional medical programs revealed the following information: Advisory councils had 12 to 146 members. Of a total of 926 members in several regional advisory groups, 216 (about 23 percent) were classi- fied as nonprofessionals. Of the 216, less than 5 percent could be classi- fied as middle-class citizens without vested interests in ithe health indus- try. Of the membership lists of 20 State councils for comprehensive health planning, only one of 273 con- suniers was listed as a laborer. Nineteen percent were biusiness exec- utives, 14.8 percent represented some voluntary health agency, 10 percent were professors or execu- tives of universities, and 9 per- cent were in the legal profession- usually representatives of some governmental judicial system. The consumers could be classified into two types: the professional consu- mer and the sportsman-amateur. Pluralistic Planning In my opinion, Lewis said, the first phase in developing a func- tional advisory council as required under Public Law 89-239 consists of converting all health consumers into semiprofessionals. Beginners should receive courses in health care jargonese, methods, and values. This on-the-job training is necessary if consumers are to have the right background to participate fully with professionals in the activities of the council. The result, if we are fortu- nate, Lewis said, is that all vested interests in the group have an equal understanding of the ground rules. When all sides are equipped with equal weaponry, the results are less predictable. I believe that it will be only a short time before our present "con- sumers" or both regional medical pro- grams and comprehensive health planning councils will be challenged by less affluent consumers who will demand a chair at the table and the right to be heard, said Lewis. If multiple interests and value systems are represented on these councils, then why not recognize it and permit pluralistic planning, asked Lewis? Why do we not al- low the adversary system of the political process to operate in an overt rather than a covert manner? All of the concerned groups with different orientations might prepare plans clearly stating their imme- diate and long term objectives and the methods by which these objec- tives would be achieved. The plans could be presented to a council charged not with developing a uni- fied plan but with preparing the best plan based on all the alternatives presented. Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 267</page><page sequence="80">At a time when we are trying to integrate all things, Lewis declared, it might be useful to recognize that their separateness supplies a basis on which to develop a pluralistic ap- proach to unified planning. A Future-Oriented Society Must Cast Off the Bonds It is my contention that we are fast coming to the crossroads whereby the choice will be between a planned society and a "planning society," said Mary F. Arnold, lec- turer in public health administra- tion, School of Public Health, Uni- versity of Cialifornia, Berkeley. In the arena of health, she said, the opportunity is here to develop a new approach to societal planning. We need to find an alternative to the present models of planning. We recognize that segmental planning which does not consider the larger system has detrimental and some- times irreversible effects. We also know that man's present capacity for predicting and forecasting the future is inadequate for the task of planning for the larger system. But most of us cannot imagine ourselves as society's planning agent or ultimate decision maker, Arnold continued; therefore we cannot trust those who believe they might be. A planned society is anathema to our values and beliefs about individual freedom. We do not like the un- planned consequences of our current segmental planning, and we do not want the constraints of a planned society, she said. Another alternative is open to us, she declared, if we have the inno- vative eapability to achieve it: the development of a political struc- ture anid the social capacity to make ourselves into a planning society. A planning society differs in the fol- lowing ways from a planned society. * The directions and goals for the future are explicit, but always subject to continual evaluation and revision. * A concentrated and continued effort is necessary to keep the cit- izens of the planning society aware of current goal priorities, of poten- tial alternate goals, and of the ways by which each can be achieved. * At the most general planning level, the pri;mary policy decision should be the relevance of current goals to the future. * At the more specialized plan- ning levels, control and coordination should be assessed by the role each plays in achieving the general goals to be served. A planning society, Arnold con- tinued, requires an informed cit- izenry-a future-oriented society- able to cope with uncertainty and continual change. Major changes in our educational system, revision of the roles of our decentralized polit- ical jurisdictions, and recognition of the primary immediate satisfactions of society's values over those of the individual will be needed. We are beginning to see a move toward teaching by self-discovery and by logic rather than by rote prescrip- tion, which hopefully, she said, will prepare citizens who are better able to cope with uncertainty and change. Gulliver, in "Gulliver's Travels," Arnold recalled, awakened to find himself tied down by thousands of little threads with which the Lilli- putians had secured him. There he was, a huge giant, struggling to re- lease those tiny bonds. Is this not what we are experiencing in our so- ciety today? asked Arnold. There seems to be the random convulsive movenments at the end of a sleep, and as we awaken we are finding our- selves tied down with many minus- cule threads, each of which can be easily broken but which, in the ag- gregate, prevent us from getting on with the new day's work. Our Lilli- putian bonds, declared Arnold, are past ways of thinking and acting in our social enterprise. The first step, advised Arnold, is to cast off the old ways of thinking about planning that are holding us back. Planning and Politics Go Hand in Hand The actions of community planning agencies to get others to accept the changes they seek and the counter- vailing efforts of those who view things differently is a political strug- gle in which the power of the plan- ners is weak, said Dr. Basil J. F1. Mott, assistant professor of health services administration, Harvard University School of Public Health. Planning agencies must deal with many different and frequently con- flicting interests, which makes it exceedingly difficult to reach agree- ment on what is to be done and to take action that runs contrary to the interests of any of the participating groups. Successful planning, continued Mott-defining success as the capac- ity of planning agencies to make decisions that they feel are desir- able-rests heavily on the ability of the planners to make the most of what little power they possess and can acquire. In short, planners must be good politicians if they are to achieve much. Even when a community health plannin,g agency has legal authority or is informally accepted as a legit- imate body, said Mott, it seldom has available to it the resources (funds, manpower, and prestige) that most organizations use as inducements to gain compliance with their decisions. Much lip service is paid to plan- ning, Mott said, but there is little willingness to give authority and other forms of power to planning agencies, and the agencies that are affected by planning decisions do not want to surrender any autonomy be- cause doing so might threaten their survival. Planners therefore can seldom move without adjusting to the preferences of the affected groups whether or not they feel it to be desirable. Mott said that no matter how much an organization may wish to be cooperative, it will not agree to decisions that sacrifice its vital inter- ests if it has the capacity to resist them. For example, disease-oriented voluntary agencies have a different view of health needs than official health agencies or medical schools and thus cannot be expected to agree to proposals to combine their func- tions with others. The only way an organization can be influenced to ac- cept a decision contrary to its inter- ests is for another group to make it more costly to resist than to accept a decision. In providing health planners with an approach that ignores politics, 268 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="81">Mott said, our theories have rein- forced existing professional biases that politics should be kept out of health. This action has encouraged unfeasible planning and a degree of self-indulgence that is irresponsible and wasteful of scarce resources. It also has contributed to the failure of feasible plans for lack of political know-how and skill. Planners should know how the power structure in their community and how their agency's connections to it may be expected to shape and constrain the planning process, Mott declared. They need a basis for de- termining what the possibilities for effective action may be in different situations and for assessing the pros- pects for mobilizing the necessary power. Planners must be helped to acquire skill in employing political strate- gies. Their knowledge of the political dynamics of planning would contrib- ute to the development of a more realistic theory in guiding practice, to a theory that reconciles the ra- tional elements of the current models with relevant political factors. It is difficult to see how planning can be made more effective, said Mott, re- gardless of improvements in plan- ning technologies, data collection, and analysis, without explicitly rec- ognizing the functions of power, and thus of politics, in making decisions that involve conflicting interests and values. Health Planning: The Ideal Versus the Pragmatic Pragmatism instructs us to look for what works and, intellectually, it sometimes is frowned upon. Yet in the context of health planning, per- haps it also instructs us to look for a more scientific basis, said Richard Sasuly and Paul Ward, coordinators of the California Regional Medical Program. One basis for choice, but far from the only one, they said, is tackling those needs for which we have the best immediate resources. Planning by blueprint, ideal plan- ning as a two-dimensional scheme involving needs and resources, sim- ply does not consider the real world, its multiplicity of real and sharply posed interests and clashes of inter- ests, and the need to find an equilib- rium for those interests in a success- ful plan, declared Sasuly and Ward. One of the first gestures toward health planning since World War II, they con!tinued, was an attempt to establish a rule-of-thumb ratio of hospital beds to population. The 5 to 1,000 ratio that evolved in the 1930's was less an organizing device than a guide to future action and control. The goal was to locate new hospitals so as to prevent waste and duplication of services, meet health needs, and promote efficiency. The planners linked their effortsi to the Hill-Burton legislation. Their rather meager success during the first 12 years is well documented. At least one corner was turned in 1960, said Sasuly and Ward, when the American Hospital Associaition (AHA) and the Public Health Serv- ice established a joint committee on areawide health facility planning. By May 1968 the doctrine of plan- ning had taken root so firmly in the hospital field that the AHA could in a major policy statement "urge its members to be active participants- with emphasis on invention, innova- tion, and adaptation-in planning that will contribute significantly to an adaptive health service system designed to meet community-oriented goals, and that will assure interde- pendence of all providers of health service." Where the hospital com- munity led, the other providers are only beginning to follow, they remarked. Two relatively recent pieces of Federal legislation (Public Laws 89- 239 and 89-749) enjoin us to seek the participation of all health pro- viders in planning. We are trying to find out how this legislation can be made to work, said Sasuly and Ward. The program planners were told to go forth and plan-plan how to improve the delivery of services, primarily through the achievement of cooperative arrangements on re- gional lines-before starting any operational projects. Key Planning Principles A plan works in situations, they said, where interplay exists among classes, groups, and other special interests, where the parties can find room for agreement on at least some issues. According to Sasuly and Ward, key principles in a framework for health planning might be the following: * Recognition that planning is not an abstract process but shares in the qualities of other forms of forecast- ing and recognition that objectives must be formulated against a shift- ing background. * Estimation of needs, with con- sideration for the great variety of needs and the different priorities that different groups may attach to them * Marshaling of resources, which includes the achievement of some consensus of the state-of-the-art in coping with each disease * Understanding the necessity for drafting plans that will enlist and coalesce enough of the critical social forces and groups to achieve a viable result * Use of every available technique for evaluation, partly to lay a basis for choice where alternate courses open up, and partly to provide a re- turning flow of information from the operation of the plan, thereby re- shaping the other ingredients in planning. Objectives and Evaluation Setting objectives makes at least two specific demands on the planner, Sasuly and Ward declared: First, a mechanism is created within the framework of planning that permits flexibility and constant reexamina- tion of goals in the light of shifts in the real world; second, interplay and equilibrium are maintained among the interested parties (a pre- condition for successful planning at all stages). We may fear a goal as sweeping as "find a cure for cancer" because such a target permits no timetable, they said. But if we settle for a goal like "test 36 antimetabolites over a 24-month period," our efficiency in biologic engineering may be totally irrelevant. We need objective standards based on the most nearly impervious data, they maintained. The fact that eval- uation is difficult is no reason for running from it. We mean the eval- Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 269</page><page sequence="82">uation of results over a span of a few years as distinct, say, from evalua- tion of mortality data in the very long run or, in the very short run, evaluating proposals when they are offered or evaluating the administra- tive conduct of projec,ts in progress. This phase of the problem has led many to think of applying cost bene- fit or cost effectiveness analysis to health planning. One cost-benefit approach first at- tempts to count lives saved and then prices out those lives on the basis of earning capacity over the reimaining lifetime. Another sets the effective price of a program as the sum of the prices all affected people would be willing to pay to have it. Despite the difficulties, said Sasuly and Ward, additional research into cost effectiveness seems entirely feasible. Perhaps a partial solution lies in analysis that considers the total social cost of illness, that meas- ures consequences of programs by mortality and morbidity, and that sets dollar amounts for each episode of disability relieved or avoided as a piece of a total social cost of health service. Professional and Community Should Share Control When a program is time inte- grated and the integral is infinitesi- mal, the community soon recognizes that it is being cheated, staid Dr. M. Alfred Haynes, project direcetor, Na- tional Medical Association Founda- tion. Nor is the community satisfied if the change is substantial yet pre- serves or worsens an unequal social status, he remarked. This condition is not as acute in the health field as in education, Haynes stated, but it could be in only a matter of time. One might almost wish that the people of Washington, D.C., would get as excited about health as they do about community control of the police, Haynes continued. But health institutions probably are not pre- pared for this type of concern, he surmised. The community has always been active in community affairs and in the sharing of power, Haynes de- clared, but in a more passive sense than now; it has always had some power although it has not realized how much. Some communities are unhappy about the rate of progress achieved by health professionals, he said. They see a great deal of action but very little progress, especially in the inner city. They see a large amount of money being spent on pro- grams but not enough understanding being given to people. Some siegments of the community are angry, and the professional could be reduced to impotence, not because he is alone but more likely because the com- munity has demanded full control. The health professional with even the best of intentions has diffi- culty identifying what is meant by "the community," Haynes declared. He deals with community leaders and community representatives, but although the term "community rep- resentation" has become quite popu- lar, no one seems to know a really satisfactory way of identifying com- munity representatives. Do you deal with official leaders, asked Haynes, or with natural leaders? Do you negotiate with the staff of community organizations or seek grassroots support? Do you listen to the militant minority or seek out the silent minority? If the health professional listens to every- one, how does he act in the face of extreme and conflicting views? Does he substitute his own judgment and act, or does he decide not to act at all? There are no rigid rules, said Haynes. The decision to operate a health department clinic from 9 to 5 is a decision in which a community has a vested interest, Haynes believes, but the health professional is c'on- cerned thalt if the consumer is allowed to share in such decisions he may not know where to draw the line. In instances where the com- munity has participated, said Haynes, these fears have seldom been justified. If consumers are given an opportunity to share in deci- sions, they will often find a new solution or accept old ones with greater grace. When one community realized that lack of personal protec- tion for a clinical istaff prevented them from operating an evening clinic, they offered such protection. In our project in Washington, D.C., Haynes said, we proposed the con- struction of a 200-bed nursing home. The community criticized us for set- ting the 200-bed limit and demanded a 500-bed home, but their opposition disappeared when we discussed with them the cost of constructing one bed. When ithe Federal Housing Ad- ministration became involved, the community assumed that the Gov- ernment was providing the money- when in fact the mortgage was 'to be provided by the insurance industry and the equity by the physicians. Money is often the root of a prob- lem, said Haynes. The rising cost of medical care is one issue that will force the community to demand a share in decisions affecting them directly, and with present high costs consumers also will want to look critically at the quality received for the money spent. Spelcialists tend to think of health in the purest sense, as though it ex- ists in a vaccum, Haynes remarked. The community, he isaid, tends to have a more balanced perspective and views health in relation to em- ployment, housing, and other social problems. Health professionals and health institutions are now being forced by communities to abandon the posture of specialism and isola- tion in order to become more relevant. The professional and the com- munity should share control, Haynes declared, but only the irresponsible professional would abdicate all power. Sharing control may be diffi- cult, he said, but abdicating cer- tainly cannot be in the best interests of the community. The future of health services in this country may well depend on the ability of the health professional to effect a work- ing relationship between organized medicine, the government, and 'the community. The National Medical Association Foundation is experimenting with this kind of partnership in its District of Ciolumbia program of healith care for the inner city, Haynes said. Most of the equity for the pro- totype nursing home and comprehen- sive health 'care unit has come from the membership lof the National Medical Association. The Equitable Life Assurance Society has indicated 270 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="83">its willini-nes's to p)rovide the 90 per- cent mortgage. But all of these efforts would be useless, he said, if the residents of the community decided that 'they did not want the facility. Because iof very special circumstances the community did not participate from ithe onset of the pro- gram, Haynes reported, but they had an opportunity to modify the original plans. Adding a group practice unit as an integral part of the complex was in direct response to the com- munity's expressed need for accessi- ble comprehensive health services. Unaffiliated MD's Starved for Additional Training Many practical difficulties have beset the Regional Medical Pro- grams (RMP), reported Dr. Vincent dePaul Larkin, former director of the New York Metropolitan Re- gional Medical Program-now direc- tor of medical affairs, Methodist Hospital of Brooklyn. They must -at- tract staff, establish the relative roles of grantee and regional ad- visory groups, obtain the interest and cooperation of schools, societies, hospitals, practitioners, health de- partments, voluntary health agen- cies, and many others in a venture that, if successful, may threaten their status quo and conflict with their goals. RMP's must search out data doc- umenting the magnitude of the problems, Larkin said, estimate the resources available to solve the problems, involve the region in a voluntary cooperative venture to find and evaluate new solutions, and develop a mechanism for rapid, im- partial scientific review. The RMP projects a central role for medical schools in the coopera- tive arrangements that are to be de- veloped and that hopefully will im- prove the care of patients with heart disease, cancer, stroke, and related diseases. But medical schools fall far short of being able to play this central role effectively, Larkin as- serted. The faculty of the medical school, he said, is particularly un- suited at this time to plan and con- duct programs for the "unaffiliated physician," the one who needs the most assistance. Withiin our metropolis 60 percent of the 19,000 practicing physicians are staff members of teaching hos- pitals with approved intern and resident training programs, re- ported Larkin. These affiliated phy- sicians are literally drowning in continuing education through man- datory ward rounds, consultations, lectures and conferences, voluntary attendance at courses, workshops, specialty lectures, meetings of heart and cancer societies and diabetes associations, and conventions of their particular societies and acad- emies. The other 40 percent are unaffil- iated physicians, said Larkin, one- third of whom have no; hospital ap- pointment of any kind and two- thirds are members only of nonteach- ing proprietary hospitals. These practitioners are substantially cut off from learning at the location most likely to motivate them-the bedside of Itheir own patients. The less skilled and trained phy- sician, the unaffiilated in particular, Larkin said, feels unwanted by the medical school and the university hospital because, in fact, he is un- wanted. He cannot obtain a staff ap- pointment there under any practical circumstances. Programs of con- tinuing education are rarely offered there for him, and even more rare are the programs that are tailored to his needs and adapted to his prac- tice. Lectures are scheduled for him at the convenience of the faculty and not at the convenience allowed by his office hours, which naturally are conducted for the convenience of his patients. Rarest of all are the programs developed with his assist- ance in advance and with continual feedback during and after the fact. Pessimism about the possibility of engaging the unaffiliated physician in continuing education is unwar- ranted, Larkin declared. Having ex- cluded him from better hospitals, denigrated him in conferences, and castigated him in public, we con- demn him as uninterested when he fails to respond to our invitations to attend programs conducted at a level inappropriate to his needs. Yet when a determined effort is made to reach out to him, when appropri- ate programs are conducted at suit- able times, the unafflilated phy- sician responds with dedicated at- tendance and attention. The success of an educational pro- gram for unaffiliated physicians at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City suggests, said Larkin, that the voluntary teaching hospital is more suited than the medical school to the continuing education of the un- affiliated physician. Health Planners: Learn To Quantitate Outcomes Public Law 90-174, The Partner- ship for Health Amendments of 1967, includes new section 304 in the Public Health Service Act giving broad authority to support research, development, demonstration, and related training in all programs and institutions involved in health services, specifically including facili- ties and manpower research, re- ported Dr. Robert R. Huntley, associate director for program de- velopment of the newly created Na- tional Center for Health Services Research and Development, Public Health Service. Section 304 replaced section 624 (Hill-Burton demonstra- tions) and section 314(e) (3) (com- munity health service research demonstrations). Section 301 of the Public Health Service Act, the gen- eral research authority of the Public Health Service, also funds some of the center's health services research activities, Huntley reported. A series of personnel and budget- ary transfers from the bureau of health services, the divisions of med- ical care administration and hospi- tal and medical facilities, and the chronic disease center provides the fiscal and personnel base for this new center, he said. During the past 5 mon,ths, the staff of the center, with the help of about 200 outside consultants (re- searchers, practitioners, adminis- trators, and users) have been defining high-priority areas needing research and developing an internal organizational structure that re- flects these priorities. Their activi- ties, said Huntley, have resulted in the formation of the following seven program areas: Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 271</page><page sequence="84">Health care organization and delivery Institutions Technology Manpower utilization Health data Social analysis Economic analysis Three multidisciplinary research task forces concerned with health care costs, care for the disadvan- taged, and automated multiphasic screening also are being formed, Huntley reported. Four study ;sections have been created or modified to provide pri- mary peer review for research grants submitted to the research and development center, said Huntley. Policy review and general advice are supplied by the National Advi- sory Health Services Council and the Federal Hospital Council, both chaired by the center's director, Dr. Paul J. Sanazaro. The center, Huntley said, has chosen to focus much of its initial directed research efforts toward im- proving evaluation techniques as applied to "target" populations in two areas of considerable national urgency: comprehensive health serv- ice programs, federally funded and designed to serve defined disadvan- taged populations, and automated multiphasic health screening programs. It is no longer enough to justify activities in the health care field on the basis of "effort" or the judgment of peers that a service is "appro- priate," said Huntley. We must learn to quantitate "outcomes" both intermediate and ultimate if experi- mentation with novel ways of orga- nizing, staffing, and financing health services is ever to provide the data needed to increase their effectiveness or efficiency. Appropriate effort is an input, not an outcome, said Huntley, and therefore cannot be used to measure the effectiveness of new procedures. Automated Multiphasic Screening Automaited multiphasic screening, which is rapidly becoming a profes- sional, industrial, economic, and po- litical issue, Huntley said, offers the center another opportunity to stimulate the development of better techniques for evaluation and then apply them to a potentially impor- tant health service. The evaluation of automated multiphasic screening, Huntley declared, must proceed along four main axes: technical, social-behavioral, economic, and biological. Technical questions relate to the validity and reliability of test re- sults and the maintenance of quality control, including the development of better and cheaper ways of meas- uring physiological and psychosocial disorders, for which early detection is believed to improve the prognosis. Social and behavioral studies must be concerned with the acceptability of automated multiphasic screening to ithe population served and to phy- sicians as a means of early detection of chronic disease and as an effective "outreach" service in finding those people in need of health services and getting them under proper care. Experience with X-ray screening for tuberculosis and Papanicolaou smears for cervical carcinoma, from which high-risk segments of the population stay away in droves, is not encouraging, said Huntley. Nev- ertheless, "outreach" is a frequently stated objective of automated multi- phasic screening and must be evalu- ated for this reason. Another area of needed research, related to physician acceptance, Huntley said, concerns the most ef- fective way to transmit the re- sults of screening tests and to assure proper followup of abnormal findings. The ultimate economic benefits at- tributable to automated multiphasic sereening must await proof of effec- tiveness, but a number of economic questions need study now. One ex- ample, said Huntley, will suffice: Given a standard output, what is the most efficient mix of instru- ments, computer capability, profes- sional and subprofessional personnel for an automated multiphasic screening installation? If valid and reliable measure- ments can be assured, Huntley said, if representative population samples can be screened, and if periodic fol- lowup over a number of years can be achieved-three big "ifs"-auto- mated multiphasic screening could significantly contribute to the knowl- edge of range land distribution of values for some physiological and psychosocial measures and offer sig- nifieant clues for prognoses. Without such constraints, Huntley declared, the epidemiologic value of 'auto- mated multiphasic screening data is limited, although the application of sophisticated analytic techniques can at least partly overcome bias in the selection of the populiation sample and the lack of long term followup of individual patients. More precise indentification of risk factors that can be modified may be as important for the well- being of future generations as much of the current genetic and immunolo- gical research, said Huntley. Auto- mated multiphasic screening may be -a vehicle for perfecting the instru- mentation and longitudinal followup required to make large-scale pros- pective population studies more feasible. Laboratory Pouch-Packed Vegetables Tested for Botulinum The object of a recent study by N. F. Insalata, section head of mi- crobiological research, and co-work- ers at the General Foods Corpora- tion, Post Division Research, Battle Creek, Mich., was to detect the inci- dence of spores of Clostridium botu- linum in two commercially available types of frozen vacuum pouch-packed vegetables. Fifty 10-oz. samples of chopped spinach and fifty 9-oz. sam- ples of cut green beans were ran- domly collected from commercial sources and kept at a maximum tem- perature of 0? from the time of pur- chase until testing. These samples had been packed in butter sauce, brought to a iboil, and then boiled in the pouch for 15 min- utes as part of their preparation. For each set of samples, two study and two control mice were inoculated 272 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="85">separately with 0.4 ml. of sample ma- terial (trypsinized) or sterile gelatin phosphate buffer. All the animals were observed for 72 hours for clini- cal symptoms of botulism or deatb. Classic mouse toxin analysis demon- strated that none of the bean samples contained spores of C. botulinum- perhaps, they said, because of the physical nature of the bean, which is not as readily susceptible to soil con- tamination from the spores of C. botulinum as is the more leafy spinach. Insalata and co-workers reported that six samples of the chopped spinach contained spores of C. botu- linum type A or B. Inasmuch as the type-specific A and B antitoxins proved not to be monovalent, conclu- sive determination of the toxin (spore) type could not be designated more specifically than type A or B, they said. Spores of C. botulinum type A or B are indigenous to raw spinach. The convoluted surfaces of spinach may retain clostridial spores and resist cleansing that removes spores from the smooth surface of the beans. The presence of spores in a frozen prod- uct that is blanched and then recipe- prepared by boiling for 15 minutes is not an imminent h'azard, they concluded. Biochemists Aim for Presymptom Screening To establish early preventive man- agement, public health biochemists largely concern themselves with ap- plying the newer technologies in clinical biochemistry (coordinated with well-planned screening studies) to the early presymptom detection of chronic and degenerative disorders, said Emanuel Kaplan, chief, division of biochemistry, and R. L. Ciaven- augh, director, bureau of laborato- ries, Maryland State Department of Health, Baltimore. Such screening is aimed at apparently well people, they said. For instance, of the estimated 2 percent of the U.S. population with diabetes, the majority are unaware of their affliction. Multiphasic screening for blood uric acid forewarns of gout, which accounts for 3 to 5 percent of all cases of arthritis, they said. Hyper- uricemia affects about 3 percent of the U.S. population and up to 25 per- cent of the blood relatives of pa- tients with gout. Laboratory work at cardiovascular screening centers, to assess risk fac- tors in coronary artery disease and to improve long term survival of re- covered heart attack victims, may in- clude tests for blood glucose, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid. Kaplan and Cavenaugh said the serum cholesterol measurement is reported to be the best single test for detecting hyperlipidemia and as- sociated susceptibility to coronary heart disease. The public health biochemist is also concerned with analyses for the detection, prevention, and control of the inherited diseases of metabolism, said Kaplan and Cavenaugh. More than 200 disorders have been re- ported-most of them rare. Inborn errors of metabolism account for about 10 percent of all mentally re- tarded patients. Most errors are de- tected early by biochemical means, they said. Screening of Infants and Children Screening for phenylketonuria (PKU) is a well-established piroce- dure. Maple sugar urine disease, a less frequent disorder associated with mental retardation, resulting from blockage of metabolism of branched chain amino acids, leucine, valine, and isoleucine, can be screened readily by a bacterial in- hibition test similar to the one used for PKU, they reported. Screening for homocystinuria can be done simply and reliably by a cyanide-nitroprusside test of urine. Mental retardation may not become apparent for several years in this disorder, although the homocystine excretion is present at birth. Altering the diet may prevent retardation from this disorder, they said. Kaplan and Cavenaugh said that techniques are being evaluated for the early detection and diagnosis of a wide variety of amino acid disorders in in- fants by screening the blood or urine by paper chromatography, high volt- age electrophoresis, and amino acid analyzer techniques in multiple tests on single specimens. Galactosemia, characterized by mental retardation, malnutrition, and cataracts, is a hereditary disorder of carbohydrate metabolism that is amenable to treatment if detected early, they said. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogen- ase deficiency is a widespread geneti- cally determined inborn error of metabolism that may lead to hemo- lytic anemia when the affected per- son is exposed to certain drugs and other agents, said the biochemist. Introduction of the rapid hemoglo- bin electrophoresis techniques makes it worthwhile to screen for sickle cell diseases and other hemoglobino- pathies in prenatal and child health clinics in communities with a high Negro population. Neuroblastoma is the most com- monly encountered soft tissue malig- nancy in childhood. Survival is closely related to the age of the child at the time of diagnosis and the site and extent of the tumor. Associating the excretion of catecholamines in urine is a striking advance in diag- nosis. A simple and inexpensive urine screening test that is applicable to specimens collected in child health clinics has been described. Lead intoxication associated with the ingestion of lead-containing paint is a major public health problem albeit a preventable one, the bio- chemists reported. Coproporphyrin- uria, although not specific, is considered a detectable physiological response to lead and is used in locating children at risk. A closer correlation between poisoning and the excretion of increased delta- aminolevulinic acid has been demonstrated. A simplified laboratory procedure using disposable ion exchange col- ums has been introduced for mass screening of children for plumbism. Quantitative blood lead determina- tions, done in many municipal and State public health laboratories, are the most reliable aid in diagnosis, they said. Serum chemistry examination is required in the management of the increased number of convalescent tuberculosis outpiatients who are on long term therapy with relatively toxic second line drugs. In this way laboratory warning is given on drug toxicity. Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 273</page><page sequence="86">A necessary and integral part of drug addiction programs, and vital to their control, Kaplan and Cave- naugh said, is the availability of laboratory service for surveillance through routine screening of urine to provide objective evidence of the drug addict's adherence to the pro- gram. The methodology involves drug isolation by extraction and demonstration by thin layer chromatography. By application of current knowl- edge in clinical biochemistry to dis- eases amenable to early detection, by research into methodology for appro- priate screening techniques, and by coordination of laboratory activities with existing health department pro- grams, the public health biochemist can make an important contribution, they reported. Importance of Lab Backup Stressed by Scientists The laboratory is of paramount importance in epidemiologic investi- gations and long term or epidemic studies of vectors and reservoirs, said Dr. Tom D. Y. Chin, director and Dr. D. Bruce Francy, of the Ecological Investigations Program, National Communicable Disease Center, Public Health Service, At- lanta. For many diseases, Chin said, the etiological diagnosis can be es- tablished only by laboratory examin- ation of the appropriate specimens obtained from patients. Etiological Diagnosis Chin emphasized that successful epidemiologic investigations require teamwork. In many infectious dis- eases the etiological diagnosis can be established only by laboratory examination of appropriate ispeci- mens obtained from the patients. The laboratory should be consulted as soon as possible to develop plans for etiological and immunological aspects of the investigation. The laboratory diagnosis of human in- fection is established by isolation and identification of agents, anti- body studies of acute and convales- cent serums, and examination of infected tissues or exudates from lesions. Proper collection and pres- ervation of specimens are essential. Furthermore, Chin said, to gain an adequate understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, it is es- sential to determine the incidence of subelinical infection. The type of laboratory support required depends on the nature of the disease to be investigated. Therefore, to insure optimal results in any epidemiologic investigation, close collaboration and adequate communication must exist between the laboratory and the field investigator. The laboratory is particularly im- portant in investigations of out- breaks such as of aseptic meningitis encephalitis, and acute respiratory disease, said Chin. These clinical syndromes can be caused by a great many different types of agents. For example, aseptic meningitis can be caused by any of the 66 different types of enteroviruses as well as by other agents such as Leptospira, arboviruses, herpes simplex, mumps, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses. Tlhe complexity of etiological diag- nosis of acute respiratory illness is illustrated, Chin said, by a study in which a child had three episodes of lower respiratory tract infection within 21 days. Laboratory studies indicated that each illness was caused by a different virus. Within 3 weeks, 15 infections caused by six different viruses were detected in the Isix members of his family. Vector and Reservoirs The reason for ecological field studies, Francy said, is to learn enough to modify a link in the chain to eliminate human infection. Many studies can be done with arthropods, their population fluctuations, and distributions, but without laboratory results indicating which vectoris and reservoirs are associated with which infection agents, the studies become less meaningful. Although some investigations re- quire less laboratory support be- cause of fewer vector possibilities or a focal distribution, all field studies are dependent on laboratory results in order to logically extend and plan further studies, Francy said. Field personnel depend on laboratory as- sistance not only for the results of specific tests and data but for the type and number of specimens needed and information about the conditions required for holding and shipping the different specimens. Field studies in most epidemic situations yield limited results, Francy remarked. In order to get a clear picture of events leading to epidemics, it is necessary to conduct studies of seasonal activity during interepidemic periods. Newer techniques and tests can enhance the value of ecological studies as well as provide quick re- sults during epidemic investigations. Because of rapid laboratory tech- nilques, Francy said, investigators may be able to concentrate their efforts in a limited area for control and followup studies. If the identi- fication of the pathogen is not made early, specific control measures may be delayed or applied in the wrong areas, which may reduce their effi- cacy. It is also difficult to evaluate control procedures late in an out- break when its natural decline may mask the effect of the control procedures. Samples on Filter Paper Used in Glucose Screening In 1966 Bittner and Manning re- ported the adaption of a sensitive neocuproine glucose procedure to the conventional Technicon AutoAn- alyzer. Their technique was slightly modified for the analysis of blood samples collected on filter paper, and the combination of the two tech- niques was applied to a diabetic screening program, described by R. G. Reynolds and co-workers at the Public Health Laboratories, Ontario Department of Health, Toronto. In the procedure, reported Reyn- olds, the AutoAnalyzer trays were filled with cups, and 1.5 ml. of dis- tilled water was pipetted automati- cally into each cup. When the sam- ples were received at the laboratory, they were separated from the data sheets and quarter-inch disks were punched out into the sample cups of water. After about 30 minutes of elution time, the eluate was mixed by in- version and put into the AutoAna- lyzer for analysis. Quantitation was accomplished by direct comparison 274 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="87">of sample peaks with those of glucose standards, prepared by diluting the conventional macro AutoAnalyzer standards 1: 160 with saturated ben- zoic acid. Blood samples were obtained from 78 donors by Vacutainer and also on filter paper. Vacutainer samples were analyzed by standard ferric cyanide procedure, and punched out filter paper disks by the neocuproine pro- cedure, in duplicate, using the Auto- Analyzer. The filter paper samples were arbitrarily quantitated against standards diluted 1: 100. The mean value of 156 determina- tions by each technique was calcu- lated, and by arithmetical compari- son of the two mean values it was inferred that results from the filter paper isamples, if multiplied by 1.6 (or compared directly with stand- ards diluted 1: 160), would be com- parable with those obtained by standard AutoAnalyzer technique. When individual results on 156 filter paper samples were multiplied by 1.6 and compared statistically with the results on Vacutainer samples using standard AutoAnalyzer techniques, the standard deviation was ?5.9 mg. per 100 ml. Through 22 working days the Au- toAnalyzer technique was used for determination of 16,575 samples, Reynolds reported. About 700 tests were conducted per day; on several days 1,000 tests were completed. Two nurses obtained the blood sam- ples; in peak periods a third nurse was required. The samples were an- alyzed by two laboratory techni- cians, and a third assisted on peak days. Two single-channel AutoAna- lyzers were used. Of more than 15,000 patients screened, 1.8 percent had blood glu- cose valuels exceeding 140 mg. per 100 cc. of blood. Almost 1,300 deter- minations also were made on the blood samples of inhabitants in homes for the aged. The incidence of elevated glucose in this group in- creased to 14.8 percent, Reynolds re- ported. The followup data from this study are now being compiled. The cost of reagents was substan- tially less than a half cent per test, Reynolds said. Filter paper is eco- nomical for handling samples; for in- stance, 500 such samples can be transported in a 9- by 12-inch envelope. By relating to the customary Au- toAnalyzer values, Reynolds said, we thought our analytical findings would conform to what is probably the most familiar range of normal values in use today. With the small sample size (8.3 Al.) and the speed of analysis (60 samples per hour), we worked at the maximum;sensitivity of this pro- cedure, said Reynolds. The auto- mated neocuproine glucose procedure provided adequate analytical sensi- tivity for diabetic screening purposes with this size of sampile and deserves consideration for more extensive use. Automated System Needed To Detect Streptococcus Within the next 2 years at least part of the laboratory diagnosis of streptococcal disease will be auto- mated, said Dr. Max D. Moody and Dr. G. F. Atwood in a joint report on the present status of automated detection of streptococcus. Moody is chief of the streptococ- cus unit, laboratory division, Na- tional Communicable Disease Center (NCDC), Atlanta, and Atwood is a co-worker in the unit. For the past 3 years the unit's activity in auto- mated diagnosis of streptococcus has been stimulated by certain State health departments that are over- whelmed with specimens from suc- cessful screening programs. The rheumatic fever subcommit- tee of the American Heart Associa- tion and the Heart Disease and Stroke Control Program of the Public Health Service are interested in ex- panding such screening programs. These groups feel that streptococcal pharyngitis must be increasingly diagnosed if primary prevention pro- grams are to be effective and rheu- matic fever eliminated, Moody and Atwood said. Theoretically, the ex- panded program would increase the load of clinical laboratories to 150 million throalt cultures a year. This many cultures could be examined only by an automated method, they stressed. If the procedure is to be totally automated, they said, the difficult and time-consuming elution step in the Hochberg method (developed in 1963) would have to be eliminated or an optimal filter system discov- ered. Development of this approach at NCDC, they reported, has resulted in a direct fluorometric readout, without the elution step. Clinical studies at NCDO indicate that 'his further developed method is com- parable in accuracy and reproduci- bility to conventional techniques and the Hochberg approach. Another approach to automated detection of streptococcus stems from successful efforts in the NCDC Venereal Disease Research Labora- tory to develop an automated fluores- cent treponemal antibody (FTA) test, Moody and Atwood reported. Because PTA and streptococcal fluorescent antibody (PA) pro- cedures are similar in some respects, possible adapitations are being studied. If successful adaptations are developed, they would provide an automated method closely cor- responding to the present micro- scopic PA technique, they said. In NCDC efforts to automate the detection of streptococcus as soon as possible, concepts not based on present clinical laboratory methods have 'been considered. One such concept is continuous particle elec- trophoresis (CPE), but the authors reported that at this stage in its development CPE is too limited to be considered a practical approach to automation. Moody and Atwood noted that many details must be worked out be- fore such diagnosis is automated and gave three reasons why informa(tion about such automation should be dis- seminated now. They said the infor- mation would (a) help laboratories with active screening programs for streptococcus make financial and staff preparations for automation, (b) encourage laboratories with less active programs to consider in- creasing their programs through automation, anid (e) lead to greater immediate acceptance and usie of automated equipment when it be- co,mes available. Besides economy and accuracy, other factors that will influence their selection of an acceptable automated method are the amounts of reagents used, the engineering simplicity, the Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 275</page><page sequence="88">number of specimens handled, and the amount of handling that speci- mens require before automation. Moody and Atwood expect the data on which they will base their decision to be available by July 1969. Development and testing of the chosen method will follow and the scientists hope to report the results of these tests at the 1970 APHA meeting. Large-Volume Air Samplers Becoming More Efficient Aware of the need for a large- volume air sampler that is both re- liable and simple, we sponsor and conduct research to explore the pos- sibility of developing new and im- proved devices, reported Herbert M. Decker and co-workers, commodity development and engineering lab- oratories, Fort Detrick, Md. Areas of investigation include samplers oper- ating on the following principles: 1. Electrostatic precipitation in the field produced by a space charge. 2. Electrostatic precipitation in the field produced by charged par- allel plates. 3. Electrostatic precipitation of particles onto oppositely charged liquid droplets. 4. Air washing, with subsequent removal by a cyclone. 5. Inerital impaction by a rapidly moving surface. 6. Inertial impingement onto a wetted surface. Of iall these approaches, the principle of electrostatic precipita- tion in the field produced by charged parallel plates, the principle of in- ertial impingement on a wetted sur- face, and the principle of air wash- ing with subsequent collection in a cyclone appear most promising, the investigators said. Electrostatic Precipitator As an outgrowth of a Fort Detrick development contract, large-volume electrostatic precipitator air samp- lers have become commercially avail- able. The air enters these samplers through a corona discharge that negatively charges the particles and passes between a high-voltage plate and a collection disk. The particles negatively charged by the corona are attracted and concentrated into a liquid that flows over the collec- tion disk, wvhich is at ground po- 'tential. The liquid flows into a groove located at the periphery of the disk and then is picked up by a suction probe and pumped into -an effluent reservoir. The air is drawn through the sampler to the exhaust by means of a centrifugal blower. Recent engineering and development work with subsequent retrofitting has been done on this type of sam- pler, and it has become considerably more reliable. Multislit Impinger Of particular interest to the inves- tigators at Fort Detrick is a simple multislit impinger sampler. The operating principle was adapted partly from the single slit agar sampler developed several years ago for the direct impaction of bacterial particles onto a rotating agar plate. The agar slit sampler is available in a commercial version and has been widely adopted and used in public health laboratories as well as in our own research, the investigators reported. The initial multislit impinger sampler that we developed about a year ago operates on the principle of inertial impingement of airborne particles into 'a liquid film main- tained on the surface of a rotating disk, they siaid. Air is drawn into the sampler at a rate of 500 liters per minute through eight small rec- tangular slits located near the sur- face of the disk. The collection liquid is pumped to the center of the rotat- ing disk through a small-diameter stainless steel tube suspended above and across the diameter of the disk. This tube also serves as a spreader to distribute the liquid uniformly over the surface of the disk, they said. The high-velocity air jets di- rected against the liquid film cause the airborne particles to impinge into the liquid. The particle-laden liquid then flows across the surface of the disk and is removed by a hol- low plastic scraper positioned at the rim of the disk that allows the liquid to pass into a collection tube, where it is drawn by vacuum into a con- tainer. This multislit sampler recently was improved to determine optimum sampler design and operating con- ditions, the group reported. Such parameters as width of slit, distance from slit to disk, and rate of liquid input were investigated. Based on the test data obtained, the most de- sirable design and operational fea- tures were selected. This sampler, which currently is under commercial development, now operates at 1,000 liters per minute. Other modifica- tions include changes to the angular placement of the slits and the col- lection liquid feed system. In addi- tion, the sampler was converted into a self-contained unit by incorporat- ing a peristaltic pump, for supplying and removing the collection fluid, and a centrifugal blower. The sam- pler is approximately 13 by 13 by 16 inches in size. Liquid Scrubber A liquid scrubber aerosol collector that operates at an airflow rate of 1,000 liters per minute is currently being developed and shows consider- able promise, the investigators said. This sampler consists of a spray de- vice, a collection tube, a glass coales- cence tube, and a cyclone mist sep- arator containing a wash tube. The principle of operation is based on the production of a fine mist in a rapidly moving airstream, with the ultimate collection of the aerosol in the mist or impaction on the elbow and subsequent washoff. The par- ticulates in the mist are collected at the effluent end of the cyclone. Results The researchers reported that the results of twenty 5-minute tests for each sampler with Serratia marces- cens as the test organism showed that the average collection efficiency was 95 percent for the electrostatic precipitator, 90 percent for the multi- slit sampler, and 70 percent for the liquid scrubber sampler. These percentages are based on an assumed 100 percent efficiency for the all-glass impinger (AGI-30) sampler, they said. Similar trials with Bacillus sub- tilis var niger as the test organism showed that the collection efficiency was 74 percent for the electrostatic precipitator, 86 percent for the multi- 276 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="89">Efficiency of large-volume air samplers, in percent Test organisms Type of sampler-- Serratia mar- Bacillus subtilis cescens var niger Electrostatic precipitator -95 74 Multislit impinger -90 86 Liquid scrubber -70 63 slit sampler, and 63 percent for the liquid scrubber. The workers re- ported that the reason these recov- eries were lower than for S. mar- cesces was the apparent interaction between gram-positive spore formers and the collection medium (normal growth tissue culture medium) used. This medium contains Hanks bal- anced 'salt solution and lactalbumin hydrolysate. It is encouraging to those inter- ested in improving the methodology and sensitiveness of air sampling, said the group, that considerable progress is being made. One point should be stressed, they said: All these samplers are constantly being modified and improved, and the ef- ficiency figures reported today are subject to change. Whether a sampler is 80 percent efficient or 70 percent is not actually important. What is important, said the investigators, is the total num- ber of particles recovered for assay. Simplicity of design, compatibility of the collection medium for sam- pling the organisms, operational de- pendability, and cost effectiveness also must be considered in the final selection of a sampler. This research signifies a turning point in microbiological air sam- pling, said the researchers. We are now at the threshold of sampling large volumes of air for determining the presence of the microbiological flora in research laboratories, hos- pitals, and clean rooms. Close Field-Lab Work Needed for A-1 Results Most ecological studies of human infectious agents depend for success on accurate and timely laboratory re- sults, said Dr. Philip H. Coleman, chief of the Arbovirus Infections Unit, laboratory division, National Communicable Disease Center, Pub- lic Health Service, Atlanta. But field ecologists are often unfamiliar with the procedures of obtaining and sub- mitting material for laboratory ex- amination, he remarked. Coleman stressed the need for collaboration between the field ecolo- gist and the laboratory worker and discussed the general difficulties that field investigators frequently over- look. The typical ecological or epidemi- ologic investigation, he said, can be divided into four stages: planning the study, field investigations, labora- tory testing, and interpretation of results. All too frequently, the labo- ratory worker is asked only to test specimens and interpret the results, he noted, but he should be involved in every stage of the investigation. The importance of collaboration during the planning stage was stressed by Coleman, who pointed out that the parameters of a study may depend on the type and number of tests the laboratory can perform and the speed with which the results can be obtained. In the field stage, Coleman said, the investigator can avoid difficulties if he considers laboratory require- ments on the proper selection of specimen donors, the collection of adequate volumes of individual specimens, the procedures used in handling and processing specimens before they are submitted to the laboratory, the completeness and ac- curacy of data concerning the specimens, and the proper labeling of specimens. Major problems during the labor- atory testing stage, he said, concern the many types of tests that must be performed and the difficulty of testing specimens for an agent after the originally planned tests have been completed. Often the results are misinter- preted, Coleman said. For example, the presence of antibody in a speci- men does not mean that the antibody was recently acquired or that infec- tion was clinically apparent. He further noted that labeling an agent does not guarantee that the agent produced a disease. Closer cooperation between the field ecologist and the laboratory worker in all stages of a study should eliminate most of these troubles, Coleman concluded. More Serologic Reagents Needed Commercially The most important factor in serologic typing of the various mem- bers of the family Enterobacteri- aceae is the immediate availability of dependable antiserums, said Dr. William H. Ewing, chief of the Enteric Bacteriology Unit, Labora- tory Division. National Communicia- ble Disease Center, Atlanta. If effi- cient investigations are to be made of hospital-acquired infections caused by Klebsiella, Serratia, or Escher- ichia coli (for example) antiserums for these organisms should be avail- able for use while a series iof infec- tions is active. Although cultures from a sus- pected outbreak can be collected and studied laiter, such a procedure has distinct disadvantages, Ewing said. If antiserums are on hand or can be procured quickly, the bacteria can be partially or completely character- ized, and investigators may be able to determine the source of infection (autogenous or exogenus) as well as follow its spread and the course of therapy. Further, the patient's charts are available on the service at that time and pertinent data can be ex- tracted from them. Retrieval !of par- ticular charts is frequently difficult after patients are discharged and their records filed away. Previously unobtainable anti- serums for members of several genera of the family are becoming available from commercial outlets. This is fortunate, Ewing said, and these firms should be encouraged to produce many more serologic re- agents. Most workers are aware that certain antiserums for Shigella and Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 277</page><page sequence="90">Salmonrella are available from com- mercial sources, but many may not know that all of the serologic re- agents necessary for complete char- acterization of the fifty or so com- mon serotypes of Salmonella are or soon will be available. Similarly, antiserums for all 72 of the charac- terized capsular types of Kleb8iella should be available soon. In the identification of Entero- bacteriaceae, the genus and species of a micro-organism first is deter- mined by means of its biochemical reactions. Then serologic methods are employed to orient the strain in the proper (indicated) antigenic schema, if one exists. Antigenic sys- tems have been described for almost all the known genera of the family but all of them are not in use in the United States. This is particularly true of the systems described for the different species by Enterobacter and Proteus. These should be stud- ied, integrated where possible, and put Ito use, Ewing said. Obviously every laboratory can- not maintain a collection of all the antiserums referred to, even those presently available, said Ewing. Nor is it necessary or desirable to deter- mine the serologic characteristics of every isolant. Some degree of selec- tivity should be exercised, and quantification-at least rough esti- mates of the numbers present-is of considerable value in selecting strains for serologic examination. The personnel of each laboratory must determine the extent to which it is feasible to utilize serologic methods. Hospital laboratories differ according to the size of the institu- tion, the nature of the census, and the interests of the physicians. Since there are several stages at which bio- chemical as well as serologic charac- terization of Enterobacteriaceae may be terminated, laboratory workers should proceed as far as they can, using standard or recommended methods, and then forward selected pure cultures (usually groups of strains) to a central laboratory for further work. It follows that the system of cen- tral laboratories should be enlarged and their capabilities for serotyping increased, Ewing said. Not enough centers are available to examine all the cultures that should be studied, but facilities and means for the addi- tional training that may be required are available. Automation of FTA Test Is Significant Step Recent studies, testing for the presence of syphilis with prototype equipment, have confirmed the feasi- bility and applicability of the im- munofluorescence technique to au- tomation with equipment that is relatively simple to operate, reported Genevieve W. Stout and co-workers at the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, National Communicable Disease Center, Atlanta, Ga. Using the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) manual test, a serologist can perform about 40 tests per day. With the SeroMatic System (developed by the Aerojet-General Corp.) a serologist can perform more than 150 tests in an 8-hour day. The Aerojet instrument (esti- mated price, $15,000) consists of an automated slide processor and a mi- croscope attachment for performing the automated fluorescent trepone- mal antibody (AFTA) test. The pro- cessor is an electropneumatic device that performs sequentially the steps of the manual FTA-ABS test, from the addition of serum to an antigen slide until the reaction is completed and ready for reading. The micro- scope attachment relieves the serol- ogist of the task of applying cover slips, adding immersion oil to the darkfield condenser, positioning slides on the mechanical stage, fo- cusing the microscope, and locating the reading areas. The slide processing is accom- plished by means of a rotating table, with a capacity of 50 slides, that moves the slide through the various process stations. The initial test can be completed in about 86 minutes; thereafter a test is completed every 13/4 minutes. Comparison of manual and auto- niated techniques for testing 859 specimens from clinically defined donor groups showed 87 percent agreement, the workers reported. Several changes were made sinmul- taneously in the technique for the AFTA test so that it would more nearly approximate the manual pro- cedure. These changes eliminated most of the random variations, they said, and test agreement increased to 90 percent on 201 specimens in clin- ically defined categories, with the manual FTA-ABS test being slightly nilore sensitive.

Automation of other indirect fluo- rescent antibody tests is now being investigated and is expected to be feasible, the NCDC workers re- ported. Automation of the PTA test is a significant step in the laboratory diagnosis of all infectious diseases. Such automation, they concluded, can free skilled workers from laborious manual testing. Eighty Percent Detection In Pilot Gonorrhea Test Although gonorrhea is the most frequently reported gram-negative bacterial infection, the humoral re- sponse associated with the disease is poorly understood, reported Dr. John D. Schmale, medical officer as- signed to the Venereal Disease Re- search Laboratory, National Com- municable Disease Center, Atlanta, in a pilot study designed to illustrate the humoral response to the Nei8- seria gonorrhoeae. Schmarle pointed out that a serologic test is urgently needed, especially as an aid in screening for the asymptomatic women who comprise a significant reservoir of infection. Complement- fixation, precipitin, indirect fluo- rescent anitibody, and other immuno- assays have been used to reveal hu- man antibodies reactive with gono- coccal antigens, he said, including protoplasm and cell wall fractions prepared throjugh the use of the Ribi cell fractionator and various other physicochemical procedures. Both the immunoassay system and the antigen preparation influence the antibody resiponse detected. Thus far, the most promising test system appears to be a complement- fixation assay using a gono,coccal protoplasm fraction, he stated. Pilot studies indicate that this combina.tion detected approximately 80 percent of the women with known gonococcal infection. Teamwork is Essential In Eradication Program Teamwork between the field man and the laboratory worker in at- tempting to eradicate idisease is a concept much discussed but less fre- quently practiced, said Dr. J. D. Millar, chief, Smallpox Eradieation Program, National Communicable Disease Center, Atlanta. The degree to which it is practiced, he remarked, may determine the success or failure of a program. Experience with two major world- wide programs, eradication of ma- laria and smallpox, Millar said, re- veal that ithe laboratory is integral in achieving the eradication of a dis- ease, even though its role may be small or great, depending on the process of the disease. Three distinct responsibilities de- volve upon the laboratory, he con- tinued: (a) diagnostic confirmation in case detection, (b) quality con- trol of the implements o-f eradica- tion, and (c) innovation and acceler- ation through new knowledge. The first two are basically service functions, said Millar, and the last is a research entity. All three are equally important to the success of an eradication effort. The field epi- demiologist and the laboratory work- er must assign their collaborative priorities to the goal of eradica- tion rather than consider personal or professional preference the one important criterion. Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 279</page><page sequence="92">Environmental Health Citizens Act To Curb Air Pollution Citizens clean-air groups, varying in makeup, objectives, methods, and effectiveness, exist today in Los An- geles, New York, Seattle, St. Louis, Chicago, the Delaware River Valley, Buffalo, Washington, D.C., and at least another dozen places. In many instances, according to Mrs. B. Brand Konheim, acting director of public information and education, New York City Department of Air Re- sources, the citizens have taken bold positions where public health officials have feared to tread. Most citizens groups-school teach- ers, housewives, engineers-are angry about existing atmospheric conditions and the general apathy of the public, said Konheim; they begin talking to each other, educating themselves, and stirring up others. They name their groups: Citizens for Clean Air, Stamp Out Smog, Action for Clean Air, The Anti-Pollution League. Many such groups affiliate themselves with the local tubercu- losis and health associations so that essential office facilities and respon- sible medical opinion are available. The success of the groups, or at least moments of success-for the ef- fectiveness of the groups often wavers-overshadow the weaknesses. From the successes, Konheim said, public health officials could cull those elements they might wish to consider in promoting an active role for citi- zens in their air pollution control efforts. The groups have used varying techniques, such as conducting a speakers' bureau servicing civil and professional organizations, enlisting organizations in behalf of a specific control program, sending letters to editors of newspapers, testifying at every related public hearing, receiv- ing telephoned complaints from citi- zens, surveying aspiring politicians, organizing debates, and promoting magazine and newspaper features and TV and radio interviews. By using a mixture of techniques, Konheim said, tangible successes have been achieved. Stamp Out Smog, in California, has attained ex- haust control devices on 1966 model cars. Citizens for Clean Air, in New York, persuaded the City Council to strengthen a proposed timetable for reducing the sulfur content in fuels. New Jersey's Citizens for Clean Air called for replacement of the Air Pollution Control Commission, dom- inated by industry, with a cross section of professionals and citizens forming a Clean Air Council. The Delaware Valley Citizens for Clean Air appealed for and has persistently defended the creation of an 11- county, air-quality region straddling three reluctant States. And as the result of a lawsuit, the District of Columbia's Citizens for Clean Air is achieving a park on the site of a former garbage dump. Political response appears to come after a new climate of opinion is created, according to Konheim, and air pollution control assumes a new priority in the public consciousness. Once the politicians become involved enough to appropriate funds for a full-scale control program, Konheim thinks that the role of the citizen should properly change. If the short range goals of the con- trol program represent tangible im- provement in air quality, the citizens can be most effective in giving whole- hearted support to that program, so that with this allegiance the control officer can more effectively fight the many who must still be fought. The change will be made reluc- tantly, she said. Citizens have only to love nature, Rachel Carson, and eating at outdoor cafes to become self-proclaimed experts on how to deal with the complex chemistry of contaminated air. A still loftier mission of the citi- zens groups is to create a continuing high priority for clean air, Konheim stated. Are highway designers in- vestigating air pollution before use of air rights is planned? Are auto manufacturers considering clean exhaust as important as clean body lines? Are builders of huge housing complexes specifying nonpolluting methods of providing heat and dis- posing of wastes? Are packagers con- sidering what happens when new plastics are incinerated? And most important, are our schools develop- ing another generation of polluters, or a generation that places a high stake on clean air? Chasms Separate Science And Citizen-Consumer Who speaks for the citizen-con- sumer? asked Howard Ennes, sec- ond vice president for corporate rela- tions, The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, New York. For me at least, he said, one point is pertinent: Professionals and scientists and public service admin- istrators must recognize the chasms separating science and technology and public policy from the citizen- consumer. They must actively seek an effective partnership-simply for the sake of survival-especially in the fields of environment and health and human ecology. The social protests of the day, he continued, to which health and en- vironment interests will not re- main immune much longer, are tak- ing many forms. Ennes quoted Herbert Gans: "Some will ask for equality, pure and simple; others will press for more democracy, for greater participation in and respon- siveness by their places of work and their governments; yet others will ask for more autonomy, for the freedom to be what they want to be and to choose how they will live. All of these demands add up to! a desire for greater control over one's life, requiring the reduction of the many inequities-economic, political, and social-that now prevent people from determining how they will spend their short time on this earth." Ennes commented that our society and our nation will be well served if we individually dedicate ourselves to the three objectives for action suggested by the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders: 1. Open up opportunities to those who are restricted by racial segre- gation and discrimination, and eliminate all barriers to their choice of jobs, education, and housing. To 280 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="93">which I would add health services, said Ennes. 2. Remove the frustration of powerlessness among the disadvan- taged by providing the means for them to deal with 'the piroblems that affect their own lives and by increas- ing the capacity of the public land private institutions to respond to these problems. To which I would comment, continued Ennes, that the frustrations of powerlessness are not unknown to any of us, though not to the great degree they bear upon the disadvantaged. 3. Increase communication aicross racial lines to destroy sterotypes, to halt polarization, end distrust and hostility, and create common ground for efforts toward public order and ,social justice. Clearly, said Ennes, the burden of ipoor communication bears heavily on all of us. To be very practical for a moment, rather than philosophical, Ennes said, what we really are 'talking about is involvement and participa- tion. There are many examples of significant and sometimes successful efforts at citizen-consumer involve- ment in environmental health. I could 'cite a few, and you know many more: 'Citizens for 'Clean Air, Citizens for a Quieter City, the Pure Waters program, EICHO (in De- troit), and other model-city efforts (in Oakland, the District of Colum- bia, and elsewhere). The comprehensive planning con- cept, in a somewhat different context, offers an opportunity for increased citizen-consumer involve- ment in determining needs, identify- ing resources, and setting priorities. Regrettably, the degree of authentic citizen-consumer involvement is not yet great, nor are environmental considerations 'adequately encom- passed. Ennes continued: As Dr. Rene Dubos, one of the greatest of living scientists told an international gathering, "We must not ask where science and technology are taking us, but rather how we can manage sci- ence and technology so that they can help us get where we want to go." What he was asserting, said Ennes, is precisely what we as a people seem to dismiss as unthinkable: that we, which apparently means mankind, must abandon our modern practice of asking where science and technology are taking us, and must instead ask how we can manage iscience and technology so that they will help us achieve our purposes. Dr. David Gates, ;director of the Missouri Botanical Gardens, Wash- ington University, maintained, said Ennes: "We may go down in history as an elegant technological society which underwent biological distin- tegration through lack of ecological understanding." Few Public Pools Meet Health Standards The operation of public swimming pooIs is not as good as it should be, according to A. P. Black, director, Iodine Demonstration Grant, and co- workers. Although both swimming pool and water supply operators are required to meet the same bacterio- logical standards, the water in the swimming pool is subject to con- tinuous piollution from bather load, the atmosphere, and the soil. In con- trast, water supply operators dis- tribute their purified product in a tightly closed, protected distribu- tion system, use residual recorders, and in most cases, sophisticated chlorine control equipment to pro- vide water that meets drinking water standards. Field Study The authors described a field study of the chemical and bacteriological quality of water of 193 below-ground public plools in Florida. The pools ranged in size from 11,000 to 624,000 gallons. Parameters investigated in- cluded turbidity, type of filter, presence or absence of algae, pH, determination of chlorine residual by amperometric titration and orthotoli- dine test, coliform density by both multiple tube and membrane fil- tration, fecal streptococci, total staphylococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of the 193 pools, 105 failed to have the chlorine residual required by the State health code, and 106 had pH values outside acceptable limits. Eighteen percent of the pools studied contained coliforms or showed un- satisfactory membrane filtration re- sults, the authors stated. Fecal streptococci were isolated less fre- quently than coliforms in pools with low chlorine residuals. Staphloccocci were isolated in a large proportion and were present in large numbers in pools with low chlorine residuals. P. aeruginosa, which is a poten- tial pathogen and a causative agent of ear infection among swimmers, was isolated with about the same frequency as coliforms. The standard orthotolidine (OT) test as performed by pool operators gives results that are both erroneous and misleading, the authors stated. The operator is primarily interested in the level of free available chlorine in the pool. During this survey, how- ever, the authors said they found no operators and only one sanitarian who measured chlorine residuals properly. Most merely read the flash and 5-minute residuals at pool water temperature, which leads to inaccu- rate results. A second, more accurate method of measuring free available chlorine is by means of an ampero- metric titrator. The free available chlorine is determined by titration with phenylarseneoxide at pH 7.0. In 27 of the 28 pools using cyanu- ric acid stabilized chlorine, orthotoli- dine residuals were compared with residuals measured by amperometric titration, the authors declared. Eleven pools showed no measurable free available chlorine residual by amperometric titration. Txwo had free available chlorine residuals of less than 0.3 ppm and nine slhowed values greater than 0.3 ppm. Each of the 22 pools showed a high free available chlorine residual with the OT "flash" test. Many pool operators knew little more than the simple details of mechanical operation. Too many had little or no conception of the signifi- cance of pH or chlorine residual, or how to maintain a residual within acceptable limits. Many monthly re- ports to be submitted to the health department were found filled out days in advance. Recommendations Although automiatic control sys- tems such as those used in water treatment plants are relatively ex- Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 281</page><page sequence="94">pensive compared with the cost of disinfecting equipment used at a public pool, the cost is little com- pared wvith the total cost of the pool. Black and co-workers listed these advantages of automatic recording and control. 1. A continuous safe residual level is maintained. 2. The recorder charts provide a reliable permanent record for health authorities, not only of residual present but also of continuity of re- circulation. 3. Cost of operation may be re- duced because of the efficient use of chemicals. Both free chlorine and iodine are effective pool sanitizers. Chlorine is more costly when used to maintain la free chlorine residual, Black and co- workers stated. The instability of chlorine and its activity are assets in controlling algae and keeping a pool free from organic material, but pool operators have difficulty main- taining adequate residuals in times of heavy pool use, land there is no simple accurate test for free avail- able chlorine. B-athers also suffer from eyeburn in heavy chlorinated pools. Iodine is superior to chlorine because it is more stable in dilute aqueous solution. Until an effective algicide is developed, however, the authors believe iodine cannot be recommended for general pool use. The authors strongly recommend that the statement "free chlorine residuals at pool pH" be included in any swimming pool code and, fur- ther, more effective operation of public pools could be obtained by re- quiring licensing of operators and by requiring complete lautomatic con- trol of chlorination and pH adjust- ment. Training and Certification Of Pool Operators Needed About 300,000 trained operators are needed to man the 200,000 public swimming pools in this country; less than 15,000 operators have been ex- posed to training, reported Lloyd S. Hubbard, president, Halogen Sup- ply Co., Chicago. The shortage of trained operators will get worse, he predicted. By 1980 swimming will be the most popular outdoor recreation, according to a recent survey of the Federal Bureau of Outdoor Recreation. Public pools are being planned in virtually every community which does not have one, communities which already have pools are planning additional ones, and few;apartments, motels, or hotels built in the future will lack pools. Economic Aspects Day to day throughout the swim- ming season thousands of public swimming pools have higher than tolerable turbidity, inadequate dis- infection residuals, improperly con- trolled pH, improperly functioning filters, and other commonly found inadequacies, Hubbard declared. Thousands of dollars are spent each year to repair or replace pool equipment because of the lack of trained and experienced operators, Hubbard stated. Economic losses are compounded by thousands of days of pool shutdown caused by misman- agement of mechanical systems by well-meaning but unskilled operating personnel. Training Inadequate In replies to a recent National Swimming Pool Institute question- naire, 30 State health departments reported having no requirement for operator training, examination, or certification. Hubbard said that only Dade County in Florida, Arkansas, New York, and Oklahoma had re- quirements. The courses of training range from a 9-hour voluntary one offered by public health officials in Washington, D.C., to 50 to 60 hours of study for 12 to 15 weeks in Dade County. At least 13 State health agencies offer voluntary courses varying from 5 to 24 hours of instruction, Hubbard said. Hubbard pointed out, however, that the training branch of the Na- tional Communicable Disease Cen- ter recognized the need for qualified operators 10 years ago when it pub- lished a 150-page training manual and a course outline for 3 full days of study. This manual, although no longer completely current because of the rapidly changing technology, was not used by a single State. Efforts to train and certify pool operators are isolated and dissimilar. Hubbard believes that the urgency of training should be recognized at the national level and collective ac- tion started on some uniformity of method. Construction Safeguards Most States require approval of pool plans and specifications by a governing agency before construc- tion, Hubbard said. Most of these requirements exist at State level, and where no such requirements exist in code form, the recommenda- tions of the American Public Health Association are often the basis for design criteria. Virtually all codes require adequate bathhouse facili- ties, adequate turnover of water, and appropriate mechanical systems for disinfection and filtration. Thus, the agency responsible is assured a rea- sonable level of safety and sanita- tion provided the facility is ade- quately supervised and operated. In many States, inspections are made periodically and water sam- ples are tested for bacteriological contamination. But the important point is this, Hubbard declared-ade- quate disinfection from hour to hour and day to day can neither be de- signed into a pool on the drawing boards nor inspected in a pool by occasional sampling. The health of the public can be protected continu- ously only through the training of public pool operators and the provi- sion of some means of examining the trainees to be certain they have the knowledge they need. Certification Needed Although the Red Cross trains life- guards and water safety instructors, it does not certify or teach pool op- erators how to operate mechanical systems, disinfection systems, or about good pool maintenance, Hub- bard emphasized. A recognized agency of govern- ment or business must have the au- thority to certify operators. Because the typical public pool is operated seasonally, the work can be tempo- rary and the pool operator transient, Hubbard declared. Certification would be a major step toward providing a supply of 282 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="95">qualified operators. This process could be similar to the Red Cross program of certification of water safety personnel which has made it possible for pool managers to hire qualified lifeguards and water safety instructors in all regions of the United States, Hubbard concluded. NYC Air Pollution Affects Mortality Exposure to periods of high, but not extraordinary, levels of air pol- lution-levels ordinarily found in urban air-is harmful according to a current statistical study, said Thomas A. Hodgson, Jr., division of epidemiologic research, department of public health, Cornell University Medical College, New York City. Heart and respiratory disease mor- tality in New York City are signifi- cantly related to concentration of particulate matter at a 0.005 level and temperature at a 0.025 level. Sulfur dioxide is not a statistically significant explanatory variable, he said. Seventy-three percent of the vari- ation in mortality from heart and respiratory diseases is explained by concurrent variation in air pollution and temperature, with pollution being the more importan,t explana- tory variable, he continued. An in- crease of two units (not an unreasonable change) in the average daily concentration of particulate matter during a month results in an increase of 26.7 in the expected average daily mortality from res- piratory and heart diseases during the same month. This increase is almost 18 percent of the average number of deaths per day attribut- able to heart and respiratory dis- eases during the study sampling period. (Approximately 150 persons died each day of heart or respiratory diseases from November 1962 through May 1965.) Particulate matter is an im- portant explanatory variable for those 64 and under, Hodgson stated, inducing a greater effect on respi- ratory and heart disease mortality than temperature; for those 65 and older, particulate matter and tem- perature are of nearly equal im- portance as explanatory variables. Hodgson listed the categories of mortality strongly related to par- ticulate matter and temperature; pneumonia, vascular lesions affect- ing the central nervous system, arteriosclerotic heart disease in- cluding coronary disease, hyperten- sive heart disease and other diseases of the heart and circulatory system, and certain kinds of nephri- tis and nephrosis. Bronchitis is moderately rela,ted, he said, and tuberculosis of the respiratory sys- tem, malignant neoplasm of the respiratory system, asthma, and pneumonia in the newborn are weakly related. The real underlying relation be- tween mortality and air pollution is not simply that increased pollution on day t induces increased mortality on day t, and perhaps day t+1, without more delayed effects, Hodg- son declared. As perhaps is obvious, he continued, a complex structure exists in which the role of time (that is, the exitent to which health effects are delayed or cumulative with re- spect to exposure to pollution some- time in the past) is very important and must be explored. The table shows the expected average daily increase in mortality during a month per unit increase in particulate matter. Detroit Does Something About Rat Control Biologists have estimated that the total offspring of one pair of rats, given the opportunities of total sur- vival to maturity, an unlimited food .supply, and a completely favorable environment, would theoretically number 1,500 by the end of about 1 year. Detroit's booklet, "There is Some- thing You Can Do About Rats," is poipular and effective, according to John H. Ruskin, formerly aissistant director of the bureau of sanitary engineering in the city's department of health. Its theme has helped to motivate thousands of Detroit cit- izens to do their part in rodent con- trol. The real function of a public agency, Ruskin believes, is to cata- lyze the inherent and instinctive willingness of most citizens to en- gage in "self-help." A siuccessful rodent control pro- gram, as described by Ruskin, is basically composed of four points of attack-starve out, clean out, build out, and kill out-and depends on the three E's: engineering, education, and enforcement. Assigning prior- ity to any of the three E's would be foolhardy, he said, because a pro- gram of this type would fail if it did not include all three. Not all four points of attack can be applied on a citywide or county- wide basis simultaneously and with consistent vigor by a small staff of sanitarians, Ruskin declared. But thanks to an augmented staff and the advent of anticoagulant poislons, Detroit's rodent control division launched an organized preventive service in the most heavily infested blocks of the city. Many volunteers were recruited to promote, on a self- help basis, a meaningful cleanup of rat harborages and to apply social pressures to occupants of the block who were unconvinced of the need Expected average daily increase in mortality during a month per unit increase in particulate matter Average Regression daily coefficient Percent Category of mortality mortality for increase for study particulate period matter Pneumonia -9. 40 1. 86 20 Bronchitis -. 81 . 17 21 Vascular lesions affecting CNS 17. 10 . 94 5 Arteriosclerotic including coronary heart disease -85. 80 6. 78 8 Hypertensive heart disease 8. 33 1. 54 18 Other diseases of the heart -18. 03 1. 70 9 Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 283</page><page sequence="96">for colimpliance with the sanitation measures requested by the health inspectors. An education and enforcement program was introduced to rid alleys of the 55-gallon oil drums used typically as a combination garbage receptacle, trashburner, and rat-feed- ing station. This container is cheap and durable, said Ruskin, but it sup- plies food for a large and widespread rat population. Air pollution experts and firefighters also cited the smoke and fire nuisances that resulted from the use of these drums The Detroit Department of Health, starting with a pilot area, revising the program to eliminate the inevit- able but unpredictable misunder- standings of printed notices, and using a temporary augmented staff of inspectors, covered all 13,634 blocks in Detroit in slightly more than 2 years. Individually and through the press, every one of the 550,000 households in Detroit was notified that oil drums were illegal receptacles and would be removed as such by the department of public works on a certain date, by which time they must be replaced by an adequate number of approved 20- to 26-gallon galvanized metal contain- ers with covers and handles. Evaluation of the relative success of the program is frequently re- quested, Ruskin reported. A Detroit ordinance, since 1953, has required, as one of several conditions, that any premises be free of rats before a wrecking permit will be approved; and prior clearance must be obitained from the department of health. In 1955, rat infestations were found in 9.2 percent of 2,946 buildings that were checked; in 1966, only 0.36 per- cent of 4,505 wrecking applications were rejected because of rat infesta- tions. A study of rat bite morbidity has revealed a highly significant re- duction despite increasing reliability of reporting, so that hundreds have been spared this traumatic experience. It's a Great Help to Know Where You're Going Food inspection programs, as we know them, will not continue much longer, said Francis G. Lynch, cihief, environmental health, City of Berkeley Health Department, Berke- ley, Calif. The general pattern of inspection and enforcement was appropriate in the past, but I seri- ously wonder about the effectiveness and efflciency of the system now. One of the essential tools in es- tablishing realistic priorities of ac- tivity in environmental health pro- grams is a good data information system-one that gives the most in- formation about the subject, he con- tinued. Using the data information sys- tem set up in Berkeley, Lynch said, we tested our food inspection pro- gram, which dates back to the 1920's. We gathered the most objective data we could get on the existing quality of the food establishments in Berke- ley. To be as objective as possible, we requested the California State De- partment of Public Health to evalu- ate the eating and drinking estab- lishments and rate them according to a scoring system (of 100) set up by the State public health depart- ment. The survey evaluation for the first year was in the low 70's, with an actual mean score of 72.8. For another 2 years the score was statis- tically comparable, 73.7 and 73.1. These ratings indicated that for 3 years, despite a continued effort, we had made no significant progress. We were doing plenty of work, but obviously were not accomplishing very much. Were we satisfied with what we had? If so, should we continue in a program that lacked vitality, was costly, and had no measurable achievement? Perhaps if we did nothing, the staff thought, things would remain the same. Most com- munities have food establishments that, without control, remain good; the majority are mediocre; and com- petition takes care of the few that are far below the community's ac- ceptable standards. We decided that we were not sat- isfied with our program, Lynch continued. The data information system had let us know specifically where deficiencies existed in the program. For example, we knew that 40 percent of our establish- ments used improper food-storage methods, that only 2.3 percent were deficient because of rodents and in- sects, and that only 1.2 percent were below standards because of ventilation. We directed our efforts toward improving the methods of food storage, Lynch said, and in 1 year our score, according to the State health system, rose to 82.9 percent. After we reach our goal of 85 per- cent, said Lynch, a large portion of our energies can go into some other area of environmental concern in the food inspection program, using the data system to identify the most urgent environmental concern. The final decision on realistic pri- orities of activity in environmental health programs is based on your professional judgment, said Lynch, and this I cannot emphasize too much. No computer, no information system, can make decisions. The sys- tem can, however, provide data from which realistic management deci- sions can be made, he concluded. St. Louis Heat Experiences Pertinent to Health Care The morbidity and mortality ex- periences in St. Louis resulting from the July 1966 heat wave illustrate their pertinence to general health care, stated A. Henschel and co- workers at the Public Health Serv- ice National Center for Urban and Industrial Health, Cincinnati. The conditions during this heat wave, they said, were equal to a relative strain index of about 0.4 to 0.5. At that level of heat stress, non- acclimatized middle-aged or older persons would exhibit distress and progressive inability to maintain normal thermal balance. The less heat-tolerant persons would become heat casualties, and if relief were not forthcoming, they declared, some deaths could be expected. Heat was listed as the primary cause of death in St. Louis on 246 of 1,428 death certificates in July 1966 (see table). A striking increase in deaths occurred from July 11 through 15. The death rate increased a day or two after the heat wave began and returned to normal the second day after it broke. The total number of deaths in- 284 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="97">creased with age, with about half of the deaths occurring in the over-69- year age group. During the 6 days of the heat wave (July 9-14), the number of deaths increased except in the 1- to 19-year age group, the investigators reported. The maximum temperatures were consistently in the low to middle 90's, 20 to 70 above normal, from June 22 to July 9. For the next 6 days maximum temperatures were albove 1000 F. (1010 to 1060) !and about 100 higher than normal. The minimum temperatures at night were also 100 to 150 higher during the 6-day heat wave than either before or after it. The inves- tigators said the higher minimum temperatures would slow the rate of nighttime cooling of the buildings and would, in effect, increase the total daily heat load. In addition, such high nighttime temperatures would interfere with proper sleep, rest, and recuperation. For the heat wave period, the 246 certified primary heat deaths ac- counted for about 65 percent of the total excess deaths in July. More women than men died from the heat during this period although no sex difference was seen in total deaths. The percentage of heat deaths to total deaths also was greater for Negroes than white peopile (see table). Available hospital records for 200 of the 246 persons who died were reviewed by the investigators. Eighty of 200 persons were dead on arrival at the hospital. Nearly all those admitted to the hospital dur- ing the heat wave had body (oral or rectal) temperatures of 1030 to 1060 on admission. These people appeared to be heat stroke victims. The investigators reported as an interesting feature that one hospital was divided into three main units, one unit air conditioned and the other two not air conditioned. Thirty-five heat deaths occurred in the two units that were not air conditioned. Laboratory data were obtained on only 100 of the 246 deceased patients. In most cases normal plasma electrolyte (sodium, potas- sium, chloride) values were found. Hyperkalemia has been reported as an important electrolyte alteration in heat stroke, the investigators said. Most of the liver function tests and enzymes showed abnormal values, indicating definite intracel- lular damage. Fasting blood sugars and blood urea nitrogens also were consistently above normal, they reported. Many showed abnormal reactions to blood tests, such as in- creased prothrombin times and bleeding problems, manifested by guaiac-positive stools, melena, and hemoptysis. The available hospital records listed the following main diseases of the heat stroke victims and showed that many of these persons had more than one disease: Number of Disease persons Arteriosclerotic heart disease__ 19 Congestive heart failure_----- 10 Diabetes -----------_------ 7 Hypertension ---------------- 6 Syphilis --------------------- 5 Cerebral vascular accident_---- 5 Alcoholism ------------------- 4 Emphysema_----------------- 3 Cancer (uterus, lip, breast) --- 3 The morbidity and mortality ex- periences during the July 1966 heat wave are pertinent to the problems of health care in a Civil Defense shelter, the investigators said. In 12 to 36 hours many persons would be- come hea,t casualties if the tempera- ture within the shelter rose to 950 'P. or above. Older and middle-aged groups are affected more than younger people. Persons with acute or chronic cardiovascular and pul- monary disorders are particularly susceptible, they said. Law Enforcement Essential in Public Health Work Prosecution is a dirty word in public health, and many health of- ficers and sanitarians are litigation- shy. Don't be, said Frank P. Grad, associate director, legislative draft- ing research fund, Columbia Univer- sity School of Law and author of the Public Health Law Manual (APHA, 1965). If you mean to enforce, you must be ready to go all the way. Edu- cation and persuasion will be far more effective if everyone knows that the health department means business where law enforcement is concerned, Grad said. A health department, he con- tinued, must have established poli- cies on how long to educate and when to prosecute and, when a case is taken to court, the department ought to win it. That usually means that the department should select cases for legal action that it can win. You don't strengthen the de- partment's powers and effectiveness, he said, by losing cases. An enforcement program in en- vironmental health, regardless of the special field (air pollution, water pollution, food sanitation, housing code enforcement) invariably has three components, Grad said: first, a legal basis in statute and regula- tions; second, staff assistance (in- spectional, clerical, and supervis- ory including legal); and third, a method, plan, or system of adminis- tration and enforcement. For a decent enforcement pro- gram, Grad pointed out, the substan- tive law must be adequate. It must reflect the current tasks and objec- tives of the field, and it must be clear enough that the public and the regu- lated field can be sure what the re- St. Louis deaths, July 1966 Ethnic group Men Women Total All deaths -711 717 1, 428 Caucasian -525 514 1, 039 Negro -186 201 387 Indian 1 1 Unknown - -1 1 Heat deaths -101 145 246 Caucasian -69 87 156 Negro -32 56 88 Indian - - 1 Unknown - -1 1 Vol. 84, No. 3, March 1969 285</page><page sequence="98">quiremelnts are. It must also provide for an adequate range of enforce- ment sanctions, such as civil penal- ties, injunctions, oir criminal penal- ties. You can readily discern a place for the lawyer, he asserted, in the preparation of adequate statutory and regulatory provisions as well as in their enforcement. Every health department should have a legal staff, Grad maintained, or at least some legal staff services. Few health departments know how to use a lawyer properly if they have one, Grad declared. They rarely in- volve him when a new enforcement program is being planned, and they rarely educate him so that he can ap- preciate the aims of environmental health regulation and so that he can assist effectively in drafting public health laws and regulations. Usually, he maintained, they call in the law- yer when the trouble is complete, and the request is usually very sim- ple: Get us out of trouble and win this case for us! Cases, particularly casies to en- force environmental health regula- tions, are won or lost long before they get into court, Grad said. The adequacy and detail of inspection reports, the proper labeling and analysis of any samples taken, the proper dating and identification of photographs of particular condi- tions-all these things win cases, and they ought to be piart of the regular administrative process of the department. Only if the depart- ment does its job properly can the lawyer do his. A good enforcement program, said Grad, is the result of a proper balance of the compo- nents mentioned, combined in every instance with another essential in- gredient; namely, the will to enforce the law. Standards and Criteria For Health Protection Often men must combine their ef- forts in common cause to attain the collective protection from environ- mental hazards they are unable to assure individually, said Norman A. Hilmar, Center for Population Re- search, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Public Health Service. In a repre- sentative republic, they frequently rely on the political process as the mechanism of choice for institution- alized solutions and safeguards. To my way of thinking, Hilmar continued, government health offi- cials must afford each person the opportunity for the best possible health protection obtainable by the most appropriate and effective means, whether the means be con- sumer education, self-regulation by industry, or rigorous enforcement by government. Each health protection standard promulgated by government, Hilmar said, should have at least the follow- ing characteristics: 1. The standard should be truly relevant to the health and well-being of man and should be addressed to the prevention or control of hazards to his health and well-being. 2. The standard should be realistic and attainable. It should constitute a charter for prudent continuation of a desirable activity employing the best available methods of control under conditions that are econom- ically feasible and do not constitute unacceptable risks to human health. In general, health protection stand- ards should be attainable-at a cost that is not financially prohibitive. I can point to at least one case of gov- ernment prohibition, said Hilmar: the health hazards to workers were so serious in factories producing phosphorous matches that a Federal tax, high enough to drive the matches off the market, was imposed. They were replaced by the sulfur matches we use today. 3. Adherence to the standard should be measurable with reason- able precision and reliability. Those responsible for enforcing standards and also those who are required to comply with them should be able to ascertain when a violation has occurred. 4. The standard should be ag- gressive in protecting the public. Uncertainties about the degree of control that is necessary should be resolved in the direction that will afford the greater protection to the public. We all should feel gnawing doubts about a government official, Hilmar declared, if his main concern is to develop an ordinance or code that will not be challenged in the trade journals or in the courits. And for some control measures, he said, an ordinance or code too readily ac- cepted by those regulated should be questioned. Better Standards Needed For Home Heating Items Every community needs the pro- tection of special codes governing the installation of heating equip- ment, said Eugene L. Lehr, National Center for Urban and Industrial Health, Consumer Protection and Environmental Health Service Ad- ministration. These codes should and frequently do recognize hazards of the products of combustion as well as fire hazards. Health departments can be a major influence in stimulating the revision of inadequate standards, he said. Frequently the technical re- quirements and laboiratory testing procedures of national voluntary standards do not allow for normal hard use and deterioration during the life of the equipment. In Memphis, Tenn., reported Lehr, 327 random residential inspec- tions, primarily of space heaters, water heaters, and gas cooking ranges were made. Of slightly more than 1,000 appliances tested, 25 per- cent were found to be contributing measurable amounts of carbon mon- oxide to the home interior. About one-fourth were emitting 200 to 2,500 ppm of carbon monoxide. Similar sit- uations were found elsewhere, he said, and concerned health depart- ments have undertaken special surveys. Health agencies cooperating with medical societies can suggest that physicians consider the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning when patients have certain symptoms, said Lehr. They can suggest the desira- bility of blood tesits for suspected cases. Physicians should feel free to call on health agencies to investigate the home environment when evi- dence of carbon monoxide has been found in the blood of a patient. Based on limited evidence, the in- jury control program of the Public Health Service has estimated that 286 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="99">each year at least 10,000 persons suf- fer chronic ill effects from exposure to sublethal but debilitating levels of carbon monoxide. Lehr recalled that before revised national standards required the venting of all space heaters in mobile homes and camping trailers a series of carbon monoxide deaths occurred in trailers in widely scattered areas of the country. Brilliant detective work by two State health depart- ments identified the agent as a par- ticular model of unvented gas heater, he said. By a chance change in the di- mensions of the appliance, he stated, this model generated carbon mon- oxide even under ideal conditions of use. With all windows and doors closed, the heater had deadly effects. In another instance, Lehr said, records indicated that at least 8,000 units of a self-contained baseboard gas burning heater had been sold- 6,000 to one major distributor. The appliance was suspected by a county sanitarian investigating a single car- bon monoxide death. When it proved faulty in tests in a State health department laboratory, the Public Health Service and the State agency discussed the dangers with the prin- cipal distributor (a national retail corporation). The firm immediately undertook its own investigation of the potential hazards and, aided by national advertising and its store managers, conducted an intensive re- call and replacement campaign. Simultaneously, both the firm and the Public Health Service alerted the public by news release and requested assistance from utility companies, health agencies, and building depart- ments in locating the defective unit. Response in the affected areas was excellent. Lehr described the Pub- lic Health Service's intensive broad- scale program to assist communities in reducing the hazards of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. The following services are offered: 1. Cooperative demonstration proj- ects in which selected communities will assist in analyzing their par- ticular problems, in implementing prevention activities, and in contin- uing and evaluating their efforts. 2. Recommendations to national codemaking organizations that higher safety factors be incorporated in heating equipment and heating in- stallation standards. 3. Assistance to State and local regulatory agencies in strengthening their codes. 4. Informational material to give the public a better understanding of the causes and prevention of car- bon monoxide poisoning. 5. Informational material for physicians, calling their attention to the confusing similarity between symptoms of carbon monoxide poi- soning and certain other conditions.</page></plain_text>
