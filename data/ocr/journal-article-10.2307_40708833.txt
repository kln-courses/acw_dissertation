INTRODUCTION essay is speculative in nature; it is concerned with the role that privacy plays in modern industrialized nations and the protection that the law gives to it. To understand privacy one must see it in social and historical context. A search of the nonlegal literature, however, reveals much by way of a priori assumptions but little by way of em- pirically tested hypotheses. In many respects, privacy is a concept that is often discussed but seldom adequately defined; it is somewhat analogous to other legal concepts of high-level abstraction- we know it (or its absence) when we see it, somewhat like Justice Potter Stew- art, in a remarkable burst of candor a few years ago, said that he could not define obscenity but he knew it when he saw it.1 Perhaps this is because it is a label for a response to certain situations, rather than a full-blown legal concept. I am inclined to believe, although admittedly the conclusion is reached intuitively rather than by hard evidence, •Access to government information and an individual's right to privacy may be viewed as different sides of the same coin. Professor Miller discusses the under- lying values providing for both rights. His paper was delivered as one of the Annual Lectures before the Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Toronto, Canada. Professor David Weisstub of that school's Law Faculty commented on Professor Miller's paper The Editors. fProfessor, National Law Center, George Washington University. ijacobellis v.

In saying that, I realize that I run counter to a good deal of conventional wisdom, which seems to suggest that most people seek privacy, desire it, value it, and otherwise hold it in high esteem. Put briefly, I simply do not think that such a proposition has been or, much more importantly, can be validated. Personal privacy, thus, is like freedom: Both are 18th- and 19th- century values of diminishing significance in the modern age- if, in- deed, they ever had any substantial basis in social attitudes and be- havior. Emphasis on privacy and freedom in law and legal literature, furthermore, comes at precisely the time that the demands of the State for ever increasing amounts of data and the closing of the fron- tier make their realization, in any reasonably substantial manner, unlikely at best. The thrust of this paper is a discussion of privacy, but surely it must be seen in the context of freedom as well: The "right to know" (as an aspect of freedom) collides with the "right to be let alone" (the constitutional notion of privacy) . In the ensuing discussion, attention will be accorded mainly to what has happened, is happening, and may happen in that highly industrialized, bureaucrat- ically organized nation to the south of Canada- the United States of America. This is done in the interests of parsimony of effort and be- cause it appears that lawyers there have published more about privacy than elsewhere; and also because the U.S.A. purports to be a polity that values privacy and freedom and places them high in the hierarchy of constitutional values. Like it or not, furthermore, what happens south of the Canadian border may well point the direction of things to come in other industrialized nations. My main theme is that privacy- however defined, itself not an easy task- collides not only with the freedoms of others but with the re- quirements of State planning in an age of corporativism. Privacy, moreover, is to be seen as one thread of social thought that has had prominence during this century but that is basically inconsistent with another thread- that of loneliness and of anomie. Man does exist "all alone and afraid/ In a world he never made." Or as Thoreau put it in Waiden: ". . . it is easier to sail many thousand miles through cold and storm and cannibals, in a government ship, with 500 men and boys to assist one, than it is to explore the private sea, the Atlantic and Pacific of one's being alone." I am not trying to make that sort of exploration here; it is mentioned simply to provide some basis for</page><page sequence="3">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 233 thinking about privacy. Private man, in short, confronts and in all probability gives way to lonely man- and anomic man, too. Were time to permit such a digression, it would be interesting to ponder the reasons why no systematic social or behavioral science studies of privacy have been made.2 That seems to me to be a cause for concern and for wondering why- and also for asking how legal norms about privacy can be adequately discussed without some data from the social sciences. For I maintain, and this discussion is so predicated, that law and legal norms must be seen as a part of the total social process. Contrary to the belief systems of the legal profes- sion, law is not "there," as a discrete entity. So to believe is to engage in what Judith Shklar aptly termed "legalism," which is, as she says, the prevailing ideology of lawyers3 (and of legal educators, be it said) . If we in law have learned anything in the past several decades, it is that legalism is an invalid way of approaching that type of social phenomenon known as "the law." Most discussions of privacy in the legal literature sooner or later cite the seminal article by Warren and Brandeis.4 I, too, mention it- but for a somewhat different purpose: I consider it of more than passing interest, perhaps it is of surpassing significance, that publica- tion of that article, which is the first important discussion of an emergent common-law right of privacy, came at precisely the time that the eminent American historian, Frederick Jackson Turner, said that the American frontier had closed. Suddenly an open society, in a geographical sense, became a closed society, knowing finite bounds. A subcontinent had been subdued; and even if there was much yet to be exploited by way of resources, terrestrially there was little left to 2Inquiry made to several behavioral scientists brought a uniformly negative re- sponse. One article, on an anthropological view of privacy, was not helpful. See Lundsgaarde, Privacy: An Anthropological Perspective on the Right to be Let Alone, 8 Houston L. Rev. 858 (1971) . In Haiman, Speech v. Privacy: Is There A Right Not to be Spoken To?, 67 Nw. U. L. Rev. 153 (1972), it is suggested that "class biases may affect our thinking" on privacy; but the evidence to support the state- ment is too scanty to be persuasive. Cf., Lusky, Invasion of Privacy: A Clarification of Concepts, 72 Colum. L. Rev. 693 (1972). In Westin, Privacy and Freedom (1967) , there are brief references to the social-science aspects of privacy, but these are far from adequate. sShklar, Legalism (1964) . -Warren &amp; Brandeis, The Right To Privacy, 4 Harv.

It has been suggested that the article would never have been written, and perhaps recogni- tion of the "right to privacy" delayed had not the sensationalist press of Boston over-publicized (in Warren's view) the social activities of Warren.

Since then- the turn of the century- what Turner saw for the U.S.A. was extended to the entire North Atlantic "community" by Walter Prescott Webb, whose book, The Great Frontier? surely de- serves early resurrection. There is much in it that should be considered by those who worry about privacy and freedom and the other secular values of a secular state. Ponder, too, the implications of "spaceship earth"- the "global village" notion espoused by McLuhan- and its impact, immeasurable and subtle, on the human psyche. In its long-range implications it may have as much influence upon the way we perceive ourselves as some of the other major events in the past 2000 years of human history- the Copernican revolution that forever destroyed the Ptole- maic notion of geocentric universe; the Darwinian theory that erased any validity to the idea of the special creation of man; the Freudian view of the irrational side of the mind of man, that convincingly showed the (partial) invalidity of the notions of rational man es- poused by the 18th-century Enlightment philosphers; and Einstein's relativity, plus Heisenbergs principle of uncertainty. (God may not play dice with the universe, as Einstein averred, but so to believe takes a stalwart act of faith) . Now we see a single luminous ball, stark and beautiful, floating in an eternity of space- and suddenly we feel, deep down inside, really alone and really afraid. There is nothing quite like the impact on a sentient being of a television picture or a color photograph on the cover of a magazine, depicting this insignifi- cant planet in an insignificant constellation perched on the edge of the galaxy we call the Milky Way- itself only one of an untold num- ber of galaxies. What had to be perceived intellectually, from the time of Copernicus, is now brutally thrust into the consciousness of all including those whose main pastime seems to be to sit glued be- fore the boob tube. The consequences we know not yet, but one would be foolish to ignore the phenomenon. Surely now, even more than in John Donne's time, we can say that our intellectual heritage is "all in peeces, all cohaerence gone." II. THE CONTEXT No useful purpose would be served to delineate in detail all of the characteristics of the modern advanced nation-state. Some may be 5See Turner, The Frontier In American History (1920) . Webb's book was published in 1952.</page><page sequence="5">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 235 singled out for special mention, however, for they bear upon the thesis of this paper. First, and perhaps most apparent, is the scientific- technological revolution with its concomitant of rapid, even cataclys- mic social change. Surely it ranks with the agricultural revolution, which occurred about the time of the Neolithic period, during which man first began his tortuous path towards domestication. Through most of human history, known and unknown, man rested in the bosom of agriculture as the basis of wealth and tangible property as the basis of power. That began to change with the beginnings of mod- ern science, not so long ago as we should count time (it may be dated from Francis Bacon in the 17th century, although that selection of course is arbitrary) but really eons ago when life-styles and belief- systems are compared. The scientific-technological revolution began slowly, but accelerated to a pace that now is rapid beyond historical measure and also continues to increase. The net result, brought about, as Whitehead said, by that most important of all inventions, "the invention of the art of invention," not only is that man's perception of the world is changing, his environment is rapidly being altered, and he is slowly beginning to realize that his institutions- social and political, economic and legal- will, as Dean Don K. Price put it, be determined more by scientific discoveries as yet unknown than by presently known legal and political doctrines.6 We are aboard a train careening madly along a track, physicist Ralph Lapp has said, with no one in the engine and with most of the human race in the caboose, looking backwards.7 Small wonder, then, that a well-nigh overwhelm- ing sense of nostalgia seems to be sweeping the United States, accom- panied by a turning away from rational thought. The "Jesus freaks" are only the latest of a growing phenomenon of a rejection of what science and technology have wrought. I do not find it astonishing for a mammal, however sentient, that has spent untold eons close to the soil to reject the chrome and steel, the glass and aluminum of the con- temporary nation-state.8 What is astonishing is the fact that it has taken so long to develop and that it is still a tiny minority who want to stop the world of "overskill" and get off. Other social factors may be briefly mentioned, not because they are unimportant but because they in part are corollaries to the funda- epwcE, The Scientific Estate (1965) . 7Lapp, The New Priesthood: The Scientific Elite and the Use of Power (1965) . 8C/., Von Eckardt, The New Urban Vision (Mimeographed address before Am.

In- cluded are at least the following: the industrialization of ever-increas- ing areas of the world; the growth of cities; and an exponential growth in population. The Industrial Revolution is now rightly seen as merely the first beginnings of the scientific revolution. Relatively recent in origin, it roughly parallels the rise of the nation-state as the character- istic form of political order. After beginning in the West, it is now spreading the planet over. Modern man is industrialized man- or soon will be, as Clark Kerr and Associates pointed out several years ago.9 With the rise of industry came the movement to cities, to megalopoli that now may be seen as the most prominent form of local government (even though in the United States a given megacity is "governed" by multiple jurisdictions- some 1400 in the case of New York City). The 1970 census showed that the middle of the United States was being emptied, as people moved off the farms (which became corporate in nature) and from the small towns to more salubrious climates or to places where they could enjoy what are called amenities in today's world. Jammed together in sprawling antheaps, they pursue their anomic lives as members of the "lonely crowd," fantasizing about a mythical golden age of unlimited opportunity and unlimited space. Finally, the number of people alive today is greater by far than ever before in history, and even with the recently noted lessened birth rates in the United States (and perhaps elsewhere) that number will be significantly larger in the next 50 years. In many respects, popula- tion growth is attributable to efficient death-control measures, which keep more people alive longer (albeit often without their mental faculties) than ever before. That there is a direct correlation between size and density of population and the conditions of freedom (and of privacy) seems obvious to me.10 That more control measures will come is about as certain a forecast as can be made. Their beginnings already are apparent, as will be shown below. The growing trend toward more social controls on individual be- havior is, in large part, a resultant of the pressure of people on re- sources. We have heard much in recent months, since publication of a book with that title, about "the limits to growth"11- to economic 9KERR et al., Industrialism and Industrial Man (1964) .

And surely that is one of the pressing problems of the day. I recognize that it ill becomes a citizen of the wealthiest nation in history to advocate that the time has come for serious thought to be given to limiting growth- but that is precisely what is being suggested. The first halting beginnings of a movement in that direction may now be seen in the United States. The major illustration is the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, a statute which, as is becoming more and more evident, is basically inconsistent in its commitment to the "quality of life" with the Commitment of the Employment Act of 1946 to the "quantity of life."12 Limiting growth means, for present purposes, more social controls, and it is that hard fact that I now emphasize. The modern state is the interventionist state- the "positive state," one with affirmative obligations toward the populace. It involves a societal shouldering of a duty of constitutional dimensions, a duty to take action to create and maintain within the economy minimal con- ditions of employment opportunities and of the basic necessities of life. Exemplified in a broad range of programs, it is the American version of the welfare state. Its charter is the Employment Act of 1946, which, although a statute, in its importance may be said to have made constitutional law. Under its terms, it is "the continuing policy and responsibility" of the United States Government "to use all practicable means consistent with its needs and obligations and other essential considerations of national policy, with the assistance and cooperation of industry, agriculture, labor, and state and local governments" to create and maintain conditions "under which there will be afforded useful employment opportunities . . . and to promote maximum em- ployment, production and purchasing power." It is, in short, a commit- ment to promote economic growth as a Good Thing. As has been said, this statute conflicts with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. But inconsistency in policy often is The American Way. I do not criticize it, but merely point out that at some future time some hard choices will have to be made between the conflicting goals of the two statutes. There are at least five characteristics of the Positive State that are worth mention. i2The Employment Act may be found in 15 U.S.C. § 1021 et seq. (1970) . The environmental act may be found 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq. (1970) . Cf., Miller &amp; Davidson, Observations on Population Policymaking and the Constitution, 40 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 618 (1972) .</page><page sequence="8">238 ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW 1. The change from a Constitution of "limitations" to one of "powers." No longer do we believe in the Jeffersonian idea that "that government is best that governs least"; the prevailing notion, in the words of Robert Hutchins, is that "that government is best that governs best." The turning point to a new type of government came in 1937 in Chief Justice Hughes' opinion in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,13 a minimum-wage case in which a statute was attacked as a deprivation of freedom of contract under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Said Hughes: "The liberty safeguarded [by the Fourteenth Amendment] is liberty in a social organization which requires the protection of law against the evils which menace the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the people. Liberty under the Constitution is thus necessarily subject to the restraints of due process, and regulation which is reasonable in relation to its subject and is adopted in the interests of the community is due process." (Italics added.) Consider that for a moment. Note that Hughes speaks of "liberty in a social organization" and also that due process, in addition to being a protector of human liberty, can now be used to restrain liberty. We have not seen the last of that new view of what historically had been called "constitutional limitations." Liberty in a social organization means that the individual qua individual will have to give way to societal or, at least, group "rights." And that, I put it to you, is what the Supreme Court has been doing in the past three or four decades.14 Whether they realize it or not, the Justices have been articulating a modern version of Thomas Hill Green's concept of "positive freedom" and of collective well-being.15 The notion of positive freedom, accord- ing to Green, reflected the rediscovery of the community as a corporate body of which both institutions and individuals are a part; the net result is that a concept of collective well-being or the common good underlies claims to private rights. The duty of government, under this conception, is not so much to maximize opportunities for indi- vidual freedom per se; it is "to insure the conditions for at least a minimum of well-being- a standard of living, of education, and of security below which good policy requires that no considerable part of the population shall be allowed to fall."16 13300 U.S. 379 (1937) . we/., Horn, Groups and the Constitution (1956) .

Green wanted to reunite the indi- vidual with the social order of which he is a member and without which his existence has no meaning. Individual freedom, as a social phenomenon, can be protected only by the legal and other institutions that the community can provide. "When we speak of freedom as something to be highly prized," asserted Green, "we mean a positive capacity of doing or enjoying something worth doing or enjoying, and that, too, something that we do or enjoy in common with others. We mean by it a power which each man exercises through the help or security given him by his fellow men, and which he in turn helps to secure for them."17 I am not suggesting that the Supreme Court has openly embraced Green, but, rather, that his views that freedom can only be seen in the total social context are finding affirmation in judi- cial decisions nevertheless. Green, furthermore, does not speak of privacy as such; but there is much that is relevant on that concept in his views of human liberty. 2. The advent of a system of overt economic planning. To speak of planning in a market capitalist system is to speak in contradictions; by definition, that system is "unplanned." But "the choice of society today," Andreas Papandreou has recently argued, "is not between planning and no planning."18 Rather, he goes on to say, "the choice is only among kinds of planned societies"- given "modern technology, and the quest for a rational order where man will control rather than be at the mercy of his social environment." He might have added what has been shown immediately above- that overt economic planning is now recognized in law, whether by legislative enactment or constitu- tional interpretation. If that be so, then it follows inexorably that the State- as, in Gierke's terminology, a "group-person,"19 or as Papandreou put it, "organicist . . . [with the] image of society as a purposive, willful whole rather than as an assemblage of individuals"- will of necessity require ever increasing amounts of data concerning all aspects of national (and planetary) life in order to be able to plan with at least minimum efficiency. I do not suggest that effective planning is now being done- President Nixon's confident assertion in his first inaugural address 173 Green, Works: Miscellanies and Memoirs 371 (3d ed. 1891). See Richter, The Politics of Conscience: T. H. Green and His Age (1964) . 18PAPANDREOU, Paternalistic Capitalism 175, (1972). wSee Gierke, Natural Law and the Theory of Society, 1500-1800 (paperback ed. 1957).</page><page sequence="10">240 ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW that "we have learned to manage the economy" to the contrary not- withstanding. Far from it. The evidence is only too clear that there is much that must yet be learned about techniques of social engineering. The point is that modern nation-states inevitably, unavoidably engage in such activities; and further, that there are definite consequences for ideas of privacy. The need of the State for data coincides in time with the advent of a technological capacity to store it in computers after it has been gathered by increasingly sophisticated social and behavioral science techniques.20 There is a compulsion to acquire more and more infor- mation about more and more matters, individual and institutional; but there is no concomitant means by which acquisition, storage, and use of those data can be limited to the absolutely necessary. At the same time, it is relevant to note the guiding principles of the present technological system. According to Erich Fromm, they include: (a) "... the principle . . . that something ought to be done because it is technically possible to do it";21 if this principle is accepted, says Fromm, then "all other values are dethroned, and technological de- velopment becomes the foundation of ethics"; in other words, "feasi- bility, which is a strategic concept, becomes elevated into a normative concept, with the result that whatever technological reality indicates we can do is taken as implying that we must do it."; and (b) "the prin- ciple of maximal efficiency and output." Man is de-individualized and de-humanized. An industrialized society, the sumnum bonum of the modern era, makes man the servant, not the master, of what Lewis Mumford calls the "megamachine." Or as Zbigniew Brzezinski put it: "The largely humanist-oriented, occasionally ideologically minded in- tellectual-dissenter ... is rapidly being replaced either by experts or specialists ... or by the generalists-integrators, who become in effect house-ideologues for those in power, providing overall intellectual integration for disparate actions."22 3. The alteration of the framework of government. Federalism and the separation of powers have, by and large, become obsolescent con- cepts. Economic planning, Karl Loewenstein once said, is the DDT of wSee A. R.

Planning by govern- ment generates a need for unified and probably uniform economic policies throughout the nation. That requirement is antagonistic to the diversity inherent in federalism; it is also contrary to the frag- mentation of power within the national government itself. The fifty states of the U.S.A. are anachronisms, a source of Senators rather than a repository of real governing power, on the way to becoming little more than those vestigial remnants of an agricultural society, the county governments. Within the national government itself, it is truistic indeed in 1973 that power has flowed to the Executive. No matter which party is in power, Democrat or Republican, the President is becoming a monarchical figure- a Charles de Gaulle, if you will. Until very recent times, Chief Executives have been aided in that raw power grab by a more than willing Congress, most of the members of which are quite happy to draw their paychecks and to act as ombuds- men for the constituents. Some contrary movement is visible in early 1973, but it is too early to predict that Congress has either the will or the staying power, or both, to stem the tide toward executive hegemony in government. And the judiciary, despite the American mythology to the contrary, simply does not have the power to do more than strike an occasional blow for human dignity- and with the advent of a Supreme Court dominated by Nixon appointees, it also does not have the will. Having long ago given up making ultimate economic deci- sions, it has more a ceremonial role than a position of power in the political arena. During Chief Justice Earl Warren's tenure, it tried to become an authoritative faculty of social ethics for the nation;24 but Warren has retired, Black is dead, Douglas is old, Brennan is aging, and the bulk of the other Justices appear to agree, either tacitly or expressly, with Chief Justice Burger's tart observation in Laird v. Tatum,25 the army-surveillance case, that the Court did not sit to re- view each and every example of Executive activity. Roscoe Pound once suggested that a nation of continental size could be ruled in but one of two ways- either it had to be a federal union or 23Loewenstein, Reflections on the Value of Constitutions in Our Revolutionary Age, in Zürcher (ed.) , Constitutions and Constitutional Trends Since World War π 191 (rev. ed. 1955) . 24See Miller, Toward A Concept of Constitutional Duty, 1968 Sup.

With the decline and fall of traditional fed- eralism, will Pound's observation become the scenario of the future? My answer is yes; and further, that the American form of despotism will not necessarily be viewed with alarm by Americans generally. Of course it will not be called despotism, for as George Orwell and, even earlier, Huey Long have told us, the human propensity for "double- speak" or "new-speak" will mean that it will be called "freedom." That in all probability it will meet little internal resistance is evidenced by the ready acceptance of wage-price controls in 197 126 (something un- heard of as late as 1936) and the relatively small public outcry at the terror bombing of North Vietnam ordered by Nixon in December 1972. 4. The politicization of law and legal process. Law, in the sense of interdictory rules, has little role to play in the higher reaches of American bureaucracies, both public and private. With public law becoming the dominant aspect of the legal system, law has become purposive and instrumental. The net result, as the well-known Wash- ington lawyer Charles Horsky said in 1952, is that America is em- phatically a "government of men, not of laws."27 Kenneth Culp Davis, the guru of American academic administrative-law specialists, thor- oughly documented the point in his 1969 volume, Discretionary Justice.28 And Theodore Lowi, in The End of Liberalism and The Politics of Disorder,29 has spelled out the same point from the per- spective of the political scientist. As a consequence, power rests in the bureaucrats, whether they exist in Galbraith's "technostructures"30 or Meynaud's "technocracy";31 and power is becoming increasingly centralized within the expanding bounds of the executive offices of the President. Lawyers abound in Washington, to be sure, but as apparatchiks rather than as profes- sionals. 26See, e.g., Comment, Administration and Judicial Review of Economic Controls, 39 U. Chi. L. Rev. 566 (1972) . 27HORSKY, The Washington Lawyer ö8 (iy52) . 28With the publication of the Davis book, attention in administrative law took a major turning point- from excessive attention to judicial review of the public administration to the manner in which the bureaucracy carried out its functions, usually in the absence of any court scrutiny. This is not to say that Davis has ex- hausted the subject, but he does point up a new dimension. See Wright, Beyond Discretionary Justice, 81 Yale L. J. 575 (1972) . 29These books by Lowi, published in 1969 and 1971, spell out the shortcomings of "interest-group liberalism" as a way of settling public-policy questions. 30Set out in Galbraith, The New Industrial State (1967) . 31Meynaud, Technocracy (1968) (first published in France in 1964) .</page><page sequence="13">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 243 Law has been politicized both in its making and in its enforcement -in what might be called the inputs and outputs of the legal system. Although not entirely true, there is enough of it to indicate clearly an emergent pattern. Bargaining among interest groups tends to make public policy (that is, law) the resultant of a parallelogram of con- flicting political forces. At the other end of the pipeline, a similar process of bargaining often is evident in law enforcement. In criminal law administration, plea bargaining is now so widespread that it is necessary for the continuing viability of the system; at least that is what Chief Justice Burger recently asserted. He did not put it quite that way, to be sure; what he said was that if only 10 percent fewer suspects pleaded not guilty and demanded a jury trial, the process would break down. In any event, all too often bargaining takes place in law enforcement- in, for example, the consent-decree practice in antitrust litigation. That is plea bargaining in the executive suites, in the area of white-collar crime. Trade-offs are made and bargains are struck. Other examples include such matters as the guaranteed loan to Lockheed and rewriting its C5-A contract, and the way in which the government caved in several months ago to allow retroactivity in previously negotiated wage contracts. Much the same can be said when new policies are announced, as, for example, in "Phase III" of the new Nixonomics; according to the New York Times (January 13, 1973) that policy was a bargain struck between Nixon and George Meany, head of AFL-CIO. I do not wish to press this point too far, but do suggest that not only law-making but law enforcement, which is outwardly the clearest instance between business and the state, be- comes merely an internal dialogue- a family squabble, so to speak- to the extent that bargaining exists in the outputs of the system (particu- larly in business matters) . 5. The blurring of the line between public and private. That there has never been as sharp a line between what is purportedly public and what is private as the orthodoxy asserts is now becoming obvious. The point may be particularly seen in government-business relationships. As Robin Marris expressed it: "The industrial capital of western de- mocracies is no longer divided into two classes, 'public,' and 'private,' but rather into three, 'public,' 'private,' and 'corporate.' The corporate sector likes to be described as 'private,' but this may represent no more than a desire to conceal."32 That is not a new observation. As long ago as 1913 Woodrow Wilson said in The New Freedom: "One of the most 32Marris, The Economic Theory of 'Managerial' Capitalism 13 (1964).</page><page sequence="14">244 ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW alarming phenomena of the time ... is the degree to which govern- ment has become associated with business. I speak, for the moment, of the control over the government exercised by Big Business. Behind the whole subject, of course, is the truth that . . . government and business must be associated closely."33 So they must be and so they are, then and more so now. That business is government, furthermore, is a proposition that an increasing number of observers are making. Insofar as American con- stitutional doctrine is concerned, a couple of Supreme Court cases, plus a scattering of dicta in other cases and some decisions in state courts, have held corporations amenable to constitutional norms.34 The trend, if that it is, tends to be more incipient than actual- al- though Alexander Pekelis' assertion in the 1940s that the next genera- tion of constitutional lawyers will ever increasingly be concerned with the dimension of private governments may well be on the way to being validated.35 Pluralistic groups are being recognized in constitutional theory; a leading example is the clutch of decisions called the White Primary Cases36 dealing with the right to vote in primary elections of the Democratic Party. Those cases involved the black Americans, and stand as landmarks in the history of constitutional evolution- illustrat- ing how a drive for increased recognition of group rights not only can further individual dignity but also can have some important ramifica- tions in other areas. They also involved the political parties; and might be said to have "constitutionalized" them, for they are not men- tioned in the fundamental law. The Resulting Synthesis The emerging politico-economic order that is being produced is corporatist in nature; an indigenous form of American corporativism is being created. As yet, there is no finished theory about the corporate state, or, indeed, even a consensus that it exists. I do not wish to at- tempt an adumbration of such a theory as this time, but do suggest 33Wilson's book, which was a compilation of his campaign speeches in 1912, should not be taken as meaning that anything substantial was done to curb the power of the corporations. See, e.g., Weinstein, The Corporate Ideal in The Liberal State: 1900-1918 (1968) . 34Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946) is the leading case.

Suffice it now merely to note that Ehrlich in- sisted, above all else, that attention must be paid not only to the positive law but to the "living law"- which, he maintained, is to be seen in contrast to that which is in force merely in the courts and with the officials. "The living law is that law which is not imprisoned in rules of law, but which dominates life itself." Law, then, including constitutional and administrative law, is much more than the command of the sovereign or a corpus of rules. It is what important societal decision-makers actually do, a flow of decisions or a process rather than a static system. The black-letter rules are im- portant and necessary, but only part of the picture. The living law provides the necessary legal nexus between state and social group necessary to support a theory of corporativism. The corporate state, furthermore, is a collectivity- a "group-person," in Gierke's terminology- that is larger than the arithmetical sum of the individuals (natural and artificial) that comprise it.38 In addition, government has drives and interests of its own to further; and since it has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force and on the peaceful settlement of disputes, it does further them. Despite the original con- ception of the American Constitution, we now have a government of powers rather than of limitations. And we have created a monarchical presidency. Some of the implications of viewing the State as a group-person were stated by Ernest Barker in 1913 :39 If we make groups real persons, we shall make the national State a real person. If we make the State a real person, with a real will, we make it in- deed a Leviathan- a Leviathan which is not an automaton, like the Levia- than of Hobbes, but a living reality. When its will collides with other wills, it may claim that, being the greatest, it must and shall carry the day; and its supreme will may thus become a supreme force. If and when that hap- pens, not only may the State become the one real person and the one true 37First published in 1912 in Austria; translated by W. Moll and published in the United States in 1936. 38The concept has been recognized, perhaps inadvertently, by President John F. Kennedy, when in 1952 he said: "The public interest is the sum of the private in- terests and perhaps it's even a little more. In fact, it is a little more."

Six decades later, Barker's observations bear an uncanny similarity to much of constitutional law and politics in the United States. The State in the modern era has become an anthropomorphic superperson whose reality is as real as that of human beings- and surely as real as those incorporeal constitutional persons, the corporations. That is be- ing recognized in governmental policies emanating from all branches of government. And the Supreme Court, even when it is making its rulings that appear to further individual rights and liberties, has really often been speaking about individuals as members of groups. Finally, as Barker has said, ". . . the State . . . [has] become a mere personal power." One has only to contemplate the theory of the office as enunciated in recent months by President Nixon to note that Barker was indeed prescient. So much for prologue- over-long, to be sure, yet far too short to do justice to the complexity of the social context in which privacy as a legal norm should be viewed. III. THE POVERTY OF THEORY That American law- judge-made or statutory- has not evolved a complete or satisfactory resolution of the privacy question is obvious. True, there is a developing common law of privacy, mainly created by state courts in tort actions. True, also, the Supreme Court in recent years has discovered within the interstices of the Constitution a right of privacy that at times is protected. True, furthermore, the Fourth Amendment's provision against unreasonable searches and seizures is a type of constitutional commitment to privacy insofar as enforcement of the criminal law is concerned. These are not small developments, and we shall have occasion in a moment to examine the latter two in greater detail. The point now is more basic: Despite this discernible movement in the law, there is a poverty of legal theory (and doctrine) about privacy in the United States. The further point is that it is only when the State itself does not feel threatened by assertions of privacy that constitutional law re- flects a judicial desire to protect it. The word "threatened" is used broadly, as indicating something more than a danger to the peace and security of the nation but also to the economic health of the nation. It is with that in mind that I have selected several cases for considera-</page><page sequence="17">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 247 tion- Laird v. Tatum, the army surveillance case;40 Wyman v. James, on the permissibility of a warrantless search of a welfare recipient's home;41 the recent decisions loosening the curbs on abortion;42 the Walling case, on the allowability of "fishing expeditions" into internal corporate records by government officers;43 the Reynolds case, on the use of "executive privilege" in courts (a form of secrecy or govern- ment privacy) j44 NAACP v. Alabama, on the right of some groups to keep their activities from public disclosure;45 and the 1972 case on wire-tapping.46 Although each dealt with a separate situation, I think there is a thread- admittedly dimly seen- uniting them. Thus we see seven situ- ations: (a) protected privacy to abort oneself, coming at a time when official recognition of population pressures is escalating; (b) privacy of one's home not protected despite the Fourth Amendment, when the State's treasure was the issue; (c) refusal to allow a war protestor a ruling on the merits when admittedly he had been the object, as a part of a group, of army spying; (d) a corporation, despite being a constitutional person, being lawfully subjected to "fishing expedi- tions" by administrative officials; (e) the State keeping its records secret in a tort action against the government, in an exercise of execu- tive privilege; (f) associational privacy for groups not considered to endanger the fabric of society or otherwise to threaten societal values; and (g) a freedom from wire-tapping that is more ostensible than real. I put it to you that the common thread tying these cases together is that privacy receives protection when it is perceived to further, ad- mittedly often in an inchoate manner, the values of the State as a group-person. So, if there is a theory, it seems to me that it should be constructed around a hypothesis such as that just suggested. There may be other ways to draw disparate judicial rulings on constitutional matters to- gether, but none that seems as valid. Seen in this way, then, privacy becomes a concept much broader and much more complex than it is under such orthodox definitions as that of Professor Arthur R. Miller, who, after declaring that privacy is "difficult to define because it is ex- 4092 Sup. Ct. 2318 (1972) . 41400 U.S. 309 (1971) .

Under neither would abortion be recognized as a "right of privacy"; nor is there any recogni- tion of the government's right of privacy or of the fact that corpora- tions (surely a "group" or an "institution") may be treated differently from natural persons. Finally, in choosing a handful of cases I am not suggesting that they represent all the legal thought on privacy. The cases were selected as illustrations, rather than exhaustive expositions of a complex subject. I do think, however, that they are sufficiently representative to form the germ of a theory. Let us, then, repair to the cases, to the expressions by the Supreme Court of the United States of its varying views on privacy. We begin with the most recent- the abortion cases, Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolt on. Decided together on January 22, 1973, they are interesting ex- amples of judicial decision-making, both in the way that status to challenge a state's abortion laws was accorded without much published argument and because the Court, as it is increasingly wont to do in recent years, rendered a decision that went far beyond the immediate litigants (and thus became a sort of "back-door" advisory opinion) ,49 But interest in judicial methodology is not ours; rather, it is in what was decided and why and how. In as latitudinarian an opinion as the Court has ever produced, one of President Nixon's "strict construction- ists," Justice Harry Blackmun, joined by two other Nixon appointees and all members of the bench save Justices White and Rehnquist, sweepingly invalidated the criminal abortion laws of Texas and Georgia (and, inferentially, all other state laws similar in content) . Why? Because, Justice Blackmun says, of an implied constitutionally protected right of privacy: 47A. R. Miller, The Assault on Privacy 25 (1971) . 48 Westin, Privacy and Freedom 7 (1967) . 49The Court, throughout its history, has refused to issue tormal advisory opin- ions; in recent years, however, it has tended to do so by making pronouncements on issues and questions not before the Court in a given case. The Abortion Cases, 93 Sup. Ct. 705 (1973) , provide one illustration; Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) is another.</page><page sequence="19">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 249 The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, . . . the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. In varying contexts the Court or individual Justices have indeed found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment; ... in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments; ... in the pe- numbras of the Bill of Rights; ... in the Ninth Amendment ... ; or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the First Section of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . Then, after inexplicitly stating that those decisions "make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed 'fundamental' or 'im- plicit in the concept of ordered liberty' " are included "in this guar- antee of personal privacy," Blackmun goes on to say that it is to be found in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and is thus "broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy." Borrowing from equal-protection law (as Justice Rehnquist noted in dissent) , Justice Blackmun then set up a set of "trimesters" when abortions may be obtained; it is only in the last trimester (the 6-9 month period) that the state's interest is sufficiently "compelling" to permit it to proscribe abortions. Finally, the Court held in the Doe case that the "privileges and immunities" clause protected persons travelling from another state who wanted an abortion in Georgia- again, an extension of previous law.50 Of interest also is Justice Douglas' concurring opinion, in which he set out several categories of rights he considers protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He drew, inter alia, on Griswold v. Connecticut ,51 in which a right of "marital privacy" was found sufficient to strike down Connecticut's anti-contraceptive laws and on Eisenstadt ν. Baird,52 which said that "If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted government intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child." This opinion is noteworthy for the attempt to delineate some of the contours of the constitutional right of privacy, something that Justice Blackmun left undefined. What, then, is to be made of the abortion cases? What lessons can be drawn? First and most obvious is the propensity of a tribunal made sojustice Blackmun 's opinion interpreted the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV of the Constitution, rather than that of the 14th Amendment. 93 Sup.

Privacy is liberty from state interference, "the right to be let alone" absent a compelling governmental interest. But that right to be let alone in terminating pregnancies is a decision of one part of the duo that produced the fetus- nowhere is the would-be father mentioned53- and it is also in final analysis a decision to be made by the doctors. The potential mother is the one who is protected. Why did this decision come when it did and in the way it did? Justice Blackmun's lengthy opinion gives few clues as to the reasoning from facts to conclusion; he neatly bridges the chasm by taking a mental leap. I have no objection to that as such, for it is in the grand tradition of opinion writing by the Supreme Court, but I do find it of more than passing puzzlement to dredge up sound reasons for the conclusion. Others may dispute this, but I see the decisions as being based on the "Zeitgeist"', abortion is an idea "whose time has come/' something that seven Justices recognized and then clothed their con- clusion in the turgid language with which lawyers are familiar, lan- guage larded with history and other data. Just how privacy became a part of liberty is really not explained; nor indeed are the criteria set forth by which the Court finds new rights, hitherto undiscovered, in the interstices of the spare, lean prose of the Constitution. I applaud the decision; I find difficulty with the "reasoning." But more impor- tantly, it seems to me to support the hypothesis suggested above- it furthers, to repeat, the values of the State as a group-person. The growing recognition of a population problem, a phenomenon that got powerful impetus with the work of Commission on Population Growth and the American Future,54 has now been translated into constitutional law. The United States no longer requires an expanding population, as it did during the 19th century to fill an almost empty continent. There is a need to limit population size and rate of growth, else the dreary prognoses of the prophets of ecological doom may well come to realization. Manpower in the mass has become a handicap, the Second Industrial Revolution having not only supplanted much of the need for manual labor but also much of the requirement for 53There is a footnote in Justice Blackmun's opinion in Roe v. Wade, 93 Sup. Ct. at 733, that mentions the question, but indicates that "no paternal right has been asserted in either of the cases, and the Texas and Georgia statutes on their face take no cognizance of the father." 54The Report of the Commission, entitled "Population and the American Fu- ture," was published in 1972.</page><page sequence="21">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 251 humans to perform menial mental tasks. It took the anonymous Jane Roe and Mary Doe to translate their very personal and very human desires not to be mothers into a national policy against unwanted children, embedded now in the fundamental law, and thus to allow the Supreme Court to articulate a policy of voluntary population limitation in the name of privacy. If one ponders for a moment just what is private about two people copulating and then a woman con- sulting her doctor and going to a hospital for an abortion, attended by the usual contingent of medical personnel, he comes away in some bewilderment. The Supreme Court moves in mysterious ways its wonders to perform. Let me not carp at a long overdue decision; but do let me shake my head in bewilderment as to how one can make such a decision jibe with orthodox jurisprudence or judicial method- ology. And let me note, finally, how the private decisions of a woman can thus be translated into the common good; that is Adam Smith's laissez-faire economics translated into the most intimate of interper- sonal relations, for, if Justice Blackmun is to be taken at face value, it is implicit in his decision that by some sort of Smithian "invisible hand" the public good is furthered. It is that notion of the "public good"- not articulated in the abortion opinions- that seems to me to have importance for the notion of privacy in the corporate state. Wyman v. James is completely different, both in result and ration- ale. It is consistent only in that it, too, can be said to further the interests of the State as a group-person. There, even in the face of an express constitutional provision on the necessity of warrants before "unreasonable" searches can be made, the Court- again speaking through Justice Blackmun- determined that a welfare recipient could not lawfully bar her home to a social worker who wanted to inspect it. Those who receive the State's treasure must pay for it by not being allowed privacy safe from a search without a valid warrant. The reasoning, if that it is, is again suspect; Blackmun airily jumps from facts to conclusion without touching the ground of structured reason- ing, a feat of mental agility which, again, is the habit of judges. The interests of the State in protecting its resources override- in terms of the abortion cases, they constitute a "compelling state interest"- the interests of a woman who merely wants to adhere to the ancient notion of the sacrosanct character of one's home. That Ms. James lost and Ms. Roe and Ms. Doe won is reconcilable to my mind only by the fact that each decision furthers societal interests. And the fact that the Court had to invent a right of privacy for the latter, and to ignore an express constitutional provision for privacy for the former, only</page><page sequence="22">252 ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW adds to the wryly amusing nature of studying the flow of judicial de- cisions. Laird v. Tatum can be similarly characterized. There, a protester against the Vietnam engagement brought a class action seeking relief against the Army's alleged surveillance of lawful civilian political activity, maintaining that the spying had a chilling effect on their rights of free expression guaranteed by the First Amendment. Not a pure privacy case, to be sure, but surely analogous, as Senator Sam J. Ervin said in 1971 :55 "this claim of an inherent executive branch power of investigation and surveillance on the basis of people's beliefs and attitudes may be more a threat to our internal security than any enemies beyond our borders." But Chief Justice Burger, writing for a bare majority, thought otherwise: The 5-man majority could not per- ceive that the issue was "justiciable" in a constitutional sense. In other words, no position was taken on the merits; Burger's opinion appears to suggest, however, that the remedy, if any, was legislative rather than judicial: "Carried to its logical end, this approach would have the federal courts as virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of Executive action; such a role is appropriate for the Congress acting through its committees and the 'power of the purse'; it is not the role of the judiciary, absent actual present or immediately threatened injury resulting from unlawful governmental action." The meaning of Laird becomes clear when it was relied upon in a Court of Appeals decision in August 1972, Donohoe v. Duling,56 in which police surveillance and photographing of demonstrators was said not to be justiciable. Note, particularly, the technique of the Court in Laird as compared with the Abortion Cases. In the latter, there was no real difficulty in finding that standards of justiciability had been satisfied, not only for Jane Roe and Mary Doe but also for divers other females, completely unknown, who might at some time want to terminate a pregnancy. In Laird, because (so it was said in a footnote) Tatum himself was not chilled in his First Amendment rights, he could not assert that others were. Here, as elsewhere, it is manifest that the Justices choose their methodology, and their criteria for justiciability, to suit the case at hand. This is not a new technique, to be sure, for the revered Chief Justice John Marshall early set the tone for such obvious examples of judicial casuistry. What is important, furthermore, is that absent a 55Ervin, Privacy and Government Investigation, 1971 U. III. L. Forum 137, 153. 56465 F.2d 196 (4th Cir. 1972) .

Tatum.</page><page sequence="23">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 253 judicial ruling on the merits there can be no assurance that spying by the Army has ceased. For my purpose, I find Burger's opinion- joined, by the way, by Justice Rehnquist, who should have recused himself57 (and if he had, would have meant a ruling on the merits for the Court of Appeals had found justiciability) -to fit neatly within the needs of the State as group-person. But if that be so, what is one to think of the wire-tapping case, United States v. United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan}58 There, three defendants charged with conspiracy to destroy government property filed a motion for disclosure of elec- tronic surveillance information. The government responded by stating that the Attorney General had indeed approved wiretaps to gather in- telligence information of allegedly subversive domestic organizations. No search warrant had been issued. The argument was that this was a reasonable exercise of presidential power to protect the national security, and that prior judicial approval of the search need not be obtained. (An earlier argument that the President had "inherent" power to wiretap was jettisoned, wisely it appears, when the case got to the Supreme Court) . Not so, said the Court in a unanimous (8-0) decision. Warrants must be obtained before wiretaps can be placed in domestic security surveillance. A victory for privacy, one might say, and certainly it is on first blush. But is it really so? Even if one looks upon it as a privacy de- cision and not, as Justice Douglas said in concurring, that "also at stake is the reach of the government's power to intimidate its critics," one would have to know more about how warrants for wiretaps are in fact granted before reaching a conclusion that domestic security wire- taps are a thing of the past. It is usually possible, and even easy, to find a complaisant judge who can easily be persuaded to issue a war- rant. If so, then the wiretapping case may be a surface victory only, hollow indeed unless followed by the bureaucracy generally. For to paraphrase Justice Douglas, concurring in Gelbard v. United States,59 another wiretapping case decided a week after the 8-0 decision, judges could well "become the handmaidens of intentional police lawless- ness." Justice Abe Fortas said it well in Alderman v. United States:60 57ln a petition for rehearing, Justice Rehnquist's failure to recuse himself was challenged, only to be denied in a unique memorandum from the Justice. See 41 U.S. L.

Ct. 2357 (1972) . 60394 U.S. 165 (1968) .</page><page sequence="24">254 ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW Wiretapping "is usually the product of calculated, official decision rather than the error of an individual agent of the state/' This is not to denigrate the judiciary but merely to point out that judges, too, are human, and oft-times easily persuaded that taps should be im- posed. As Senator Edward Kennedy said in 197 1,61 "warrantless de- vices counted for an average of 78 to 209 days of listening per device, as compared with a 13-day per device average for those devices installed under court order." He concluded that the government's revelations posed "the frightening possibility that the conversations of untold thousands of citizens of this country are being monitored on secret devices which no judge has authorized and which may remain in op- eration for months and perhaps years at a time." I go one step further: it may be impossible to validate, but I believe it valid to say that all too often judges authorize searches and wiretaps without any real inquiry into the reasonableness of the request or any subsequent moni- toring of the manner in which the wiretaps are conducted. The all- too-well-known propensity of bureaucrats to lie or otherwise dis- tort the truth leads me, furthermore, to the reluctant conclusion that even an assertion that wiretaps or army surveillance have been ceased should not be taken as the truth.62 Professor Carl Friedrich has re- cently argued that "secrecy is eminently functional in many govern- ment operations";63 if that be so, where better than in the scrutiny of activities considered to be dangerous to the security of the State? The Supreme Court, in its treatment of the right of groups to re- main private, lends some inferential support for that view. By apply- ing a "balanced test" of First Amendment rights, it has found in NAACP v. Alabama a protected right of association that meant that the NAACP did not have to divulge its membership lists to state authorities, but in cases involving the Communist Party it found no constitutional barrier to disclosure. Such disparate treatment of groups might be rationalized on the notion that when a group is considered dangerous to the peace and order of the nation it loses its right of associational privacy, but if the group is pursuing other goals then its privacy is protected. This, to be sure, did not keep the FBI from wiretapping the telephones of the late Martin Luther King, but that was never litigated. eiThe Kennedy statement is contained in a letter quoted in the concurring opin- ion of Justice Douglas in the wiretapping case, 92 Sup. Ct. at 2140. ^See, e.g., Ladd, Crisis in credibility (lyo») . 63FRIEDRICH, THE PATHOLOGY OF POLITICS 179 (1972) .</page><page sequence="25">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 255 When the State really needs information, then, it can lawfully get it, despite the Constitution and despite any legal or moral notions of personal or associational privacy. As Friedrich put it, "In recent years, the destruction of privacy and the expansion of official secrecy, indeed the whole apparatus of the secret police state, have forced other states to adapt to the world of totalitarianism, to meet their com- petition with analogous weapons and thus to increase official secrecy and reduce privacy by the institution of police and investigatory methods."64 In this connection, consider the Reynolds and the Wal- ling cases. Reynolds embeds in the law the notion that investigatory reports of government agencies are not to be used in a tort action against the government, a principle that enshrines "executive privi- lege" into some sort of constitutional doctrine. That view got added impetus in January 1973 when the Supreme Court in Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink,65 in which 33 members of the House of Representatives sought disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act of Executive documents concerning the Amchitka bomb test. No, said the Court, speaking through Justice White, in an opinion that upheld the Executive's claim of institutional privacy. It was, as Justice Stewart said in a concurring opinion, purely a matter of interpreta- tion of a statute and does not involve the so-called doctrine of execu- tive privilege. But surely it has constitutional overtones; and surely it permits the Executive to assert, through the statute, a broad-gauged right to keep its internal documents from the public and even from members of Congress. "Congress chose," says Stewart, "to decree blind acceptance of Executive fiat." Presumably this means that Congress could, if it wished, change the thrust of the Act; but the likelihood of that is too remote to be worth discussion. Justice Douglas, who seems to be making a record in dissenting this term, maintained that Mink means that "the much advertised Free- dom of Information Act is on its way to becoming a shambles. . . . The Executive Branch now has carte blanche to insulate information from public scrutiny whether or not that information bears any rela- tion to the interests sought to be protected by subsection (b) (1) of the Act [concerning national defense and foreign policy]." That point of view is stoutly opposed by the majority, particularly Justice Stewart. Douglas ended his opinion with some pertinent language of Madison: 64/d., at 190. 6593 Sup. Ct. 827 (1973) .</page><page sequence="26">256 ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW "A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power knowl- edge gives." Reynolds and Mink concern judicial proceedings. "Executive privilege," however, is at its height when data are denied to Con- gress, as often they are by the Executive, who asserts a right of in- stitutional privacy. There are no definitive Supreme Court cases recog- nizing such a privilege. Many Presidents, however, have asserted it- and gotten away with it. The Justice Department's position, formulated in 1958, is that withholding information from Congress is a political matter. Said the Attorney General:66 The President is invested with certain political powers. He may use his own discretion in executing those powers. He is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience. . . . Ques- tions which the Constitution and laws leave to the Executive, or which are in their nature political, are not for the courts to decide, and there is no power in the courts to control the President's discretion or decision, with respect to such questions. Because of the intimate relation between the President and the heads of departments, the same rule applies to them. That bold and bald assertion of Executive power sets the problem. The Executive, as we have seen, considers that the people may be sub- jected to invasions of their privacy when deemed by the Executive to necessitate it, and even members of Congress may be subject to sur- veillance, according to the former Assistant Attorney General, now Mr. Justice, William Rehnquist.67 We need not tarry to debate the proposition. It is noted to provide the penultimate side of our privacy picture. The last is the Walling case, now a quarter-century old but still viable, in which the Supreme Court said that the Federal Trade Commission could conduct exten- sive investigations into corporate affairs to determine if a law had been violated; there need not be a showing of probable cause. In other words, the power of government to learn about internal corporate 66The Attorney General's statement was by William Rogers, now Secretary of State.

Rogers also said: "Congress cannot, under the Constitution, compel heads of departments by law to give up papers and information, regardless of the public interest involved; and the President is the judge of that interest."

Well and good, one might say, and high time too. If government is going to regulate, it must have data. To get it, in- vestigations must be conducted. It's a variation, in some respects, on Wyman v. James: The interests of the State predominate over the in- terests of the corporation (in law, a person normally entitled to con- stitutional protections) . That's the point being made- although I might note that a strong case can be built, in my judgment, for the public's right to know about internal corporate matters as well (as Professor Willard Mueller has forcefully argued) ,68 But the public is not entitled to "trade secrets" and "financial information" and other corporate data that may come into the hands of government, there being an exception to the Freedom of Information Act to that effect. That means that the State can know but the public cannot- an interesting proposition when one ponders its implications cast against notions of popular sovereignty and popular government. Those are the cases. There are others, of course, that could have been selected. With some variations, I see in them evidence that tends to validate the hypothesis that I have advanced: Privacy receives pro- tection in the main when the State's interests are at stake and pro- tection of privacy will further those interests. Not always, of course, but enough. Such a statement cuts across the grain of an individualis- tic conception of privacy. Just as an individualistic conception of law is inadequate, so, too, is that of privacy. IV. THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME It is at least an a priori assumption- in all probability, even more so- that privacy is a value of the middle and upper classes69 and also that it receives protection in the law when the interests of the State are considered to be furthered. Exceptions, of course, can be cited, but they are mainly in the area of the administration of the criminal law. Privacy, then, seems to be of the same order of legal esteem as the MSee Mueller, Corporate Disclosure: The Public's Right to Know (mimeo- graphed; paper presented at Northwestern University, Oct. 1971) . 69"Conceivably such sentiments [about privacy] are stronger than ever. This could be in part a product of affluence, privacy being one of the conspicuously-de- fended values of the middle-class way of life."

Since New York Times v. Sullivan10 was de- cided in 1964, more and more people have been brought under the umbrella of "public figures" who have a wellnigh insurmountable task of proving actual malice to recover in tort from those who have allegedly defamed them (as in Rosenbloom v. Metromedia)71 or have invaded their privacy (as in Time, Inc. v. Hill).72 One should not consider that the Abortion Cases greatly expanded a constitutional right of privacy. By no means is it clear that those decisions will be employed in other areas. The privacy, too, of groups such as the NAACP, should be viewed against the lack of protection of groups such as the Communist Party or the Ku Klux Klan. And the Wyman v. James situation, which permits intrusion without a warrant into the home of a welfare recipient does not find a correlative pro- tection for the recipient to, say, correct errors in a social worker's file. Take Tarver v. Smith73 as an example. There, Mrs. Tarver was re- ceiving welfare support; her caseworker prepared a highly critical re- port, which included derogatory comments about Mrs. Tarver, and recommended that her children be taken from her permanently. After being told by another caseworker that the file contained false infor- mation about her, Mrs. Tarver asked for a hearing to be able to cor- rect the file. This was denied her on the basis that it was a confidential and privileged document, internal to the state of Washington's Public Assistant Program. The courts in Washington rejected her case and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Justice Douglas dissented from that denial, stating that "The ability of the govern- ment and private agencies to gather, retain, and catalogue informa- tion on anyone for their unfettered use raises problems concerning the privacy and dignity of individuals." So it does. But the question, be it noted, was resolved against the individual. What is particularly interesting about this obscure case is that the Court previously (in 1970) had decided in Goldberg v. Kelly74 that a welfare recipient was entitled to "procedural due process" before payments were terminated. Although the denial of certiorari, in technical law, is not a ruling on the merits, the net result is a person is entitled to a full-dress hearing 70376 U.S. 254 (1964) . 7191 Sup.

That may make sense in the minds of the learned Justices of the Supreme Court, but surely there is something Kafkaesque about a situation in which as Douglas put it, "the petitioner has no rights under state law to a hear- ing to correct the reports even if they are total lies/' Enough has been said thus far to indicate at least two aspects of privacy: (a) it is a far more complex problem than merely the pri- vacy (however defined) of the individual; and (b) that it is a fragile concept at best, one that will require nurturing in the law as well as a friendly soil in which to grow and expand. Will that growth and expansion occur? To answer such a question is to attempt to peer into the dark future. One who does not hesitate to take such mental leaps is the supreme technocrat, Mr. Herman Kahn. In an interview published in 1972, Kahn spun out a "scenario" for the future in which he took issue with the "Club of Rome" theorists.75 He thinks that world popu- lation will peak at about 10 billion in the 21st century- roughly triple the present number- although he suggests the figure might go as high as 20 billion. But, he says, "we will lose some privacy, some comfort, but we can get through. Ί was brought up in California. We were very poor, but we had an old car and we'd go off at weekends and get some privacy in the country. You won't be able to do that, and I'm sorry. But we can get by.' " Agree with Kahn or not, and I for one am far from as sanguine as he is, what he does indicate is that privacy is a resultant of the social milieu- the cultural context- in which any given generation of people live. In order, then, to project the place of privacy in the future, one must be able to envisage that future in a social sense. My view may be briefly outlined: An urbanized, industrialized, crowded world, domi- nated by technology, and run by a technocratic elite. Already the con- tours of that "brave new world" may be seen in the United States. For this discussion of the (possible) shape of thing to come, a use- ful point of departure is the "garrison-state" hypothesis of Harold D. Lasswell. First enunciated in 1941, Lasswell updated his judgment in 1965 by restating his view that we are entering into a world of garrison- states, a "world of ruling castes (or a single caste) learning how to maintain ascendancy against internal challenge by the ruthless ex- 75Rahn is quoted in Hebert, Happily Into Oblivion?, The Guardian (London) , June 24, 1972, p. 10.</page><page sequence="30">260 ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW ploitation of hitherto unapplied instruments of modern science and technology."76 That, it seems to me, is a model for a type of latter-day fascism- a term I use deliberately and consciously, fully cognizant of its implications- a model that ever increasingly seems to fit the U.S.A. When the means for repression are available, as in the technology of control, and there is less than a burning desire to further freedom (and privacy) as ends in themselves- as ever increasingly seems to be the norm- then perhaps at least tentative agreement may be reached with such sober observers as Claus Offe and Bertram Gross77 that an indigenous form of "friendly fascism" is in process of creation. Said Gross in 1970: "We must accept the possibility that in this decade our America- despite all that we may love or admire in it- may have a rendezvous with fascism. And we must be aware that if fascism comes to the United States, as Huey Long suggested back in the 1930s, it will come under the slogans of democracy and 100 percent American- ism; it will come in the form of an advanced technological society, supported by its techniques- a techno-urban fascism, American style." (It is worth at least passing mention that Huey Long's son, Senator Russell Long (Democrat, Louisiana) was quoted in October of 1972 that he thought the time had come for a "benevolent dictatorship, if only temporarily.") Gross concludes: In toto, the warfare-welfare-industrial-communication-police complex would be the supramodern fascist form of what has hitherto been described as "oligopolistic state capitalism." Its products would be: (1) increasingly differentiated armaments (including more outer-space and under-sea in- struments of destruction) that in the name of defense and security would contribute to world insecurity; (2) increasingly specialized medical, edu- cation, housing, and welfare programs that would have a declining relation to health, learning, community, or social justice; (3) industrial products to serve warfare-welfare purposes and provide consumer incentives for ac- ceptance of the system; (4) communication services that would serve as instruments for the manipulation, surveillance, and suppression- or pret- tifying-of information on domestic and foreign terrorism; and (5) police activities designed to cope with the new "crime" of opposing the system, probably enlisting organized crime in the effort. One need not subscribe to all aspects of Gross' formulation to be able to perceive in current governmental programs, some of which (as we 76Lasswell, The Garrison-State Hypothesis Today, in Huntington (ed.) , Chang- ing Patterns of Military Politics (1965) . 77Offe, Advanced Capitalism and the Welfare State, 2 Politics and Society 479 (1972) ; Gross, Friendly Fascism: A Model for America, Social Policy, Nov.-Dec. 1970, p. 44.</page><page sequence="31">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 261 have seen) have received judicial approval, to note that he has touched upon a raw, quivering nerve in the body politic of the United States of America. The essence of this new form of fascism- "friendly," as Gross terms it- is the rational, calculated use of irrational means and techniques so as to control or manipulate the populace. Historical fascim, as with Hitler and Mussolini, distrusted "reason"; it was, as William Ebenstein has said, "frankly antirationalist, distrusting rea- son in human affairs and stressing the irrational, sentimental, uncon- trollable elements in man."78 The modern version is narrowly instru- mental and technocratic, operating within the interstices of the established constitutional system broadly construed and conceived. Society itself would be "managed," not merely the economy. In this development, the net result is that people will be "programmed" to want to "escape from freedom" or to fear freedom, to look upon the desire and need for privacy as an aberration. The prophet for the new (and possibly, final) age is B. F. Skinner.79 In this connection, it is relevant to quote from the recent study by Alan Westin and Michael Baker, Databanks in a Free Society:80 If our empirical findings showed anything, they indicate that man is still in charge of the machines. What is collected, for what purposes, with whom information is shared, and what opportunities individuals have to see and contest records are all matters of policy choice, not technological determi- nism. Man cannot escape his social or moral responsibilities by murmuring feebly that "the Machine made me do it." There is also a powerful tendency to romanticize the precomputer era as a time of robust privacy, respect for individuality in organizations, and "face-to-face" relations in decision making. Such Arcadian notions delude us. In every age, limiting the arbitrary use of power, applying broad prin- ciples of civil liberties to the troubles and challenges of that time, and using technology to advance the social well-being of the nation represent terribly hard questions of public policy, and always will. We do not help resolve our current dilemma by thinking that earlier ages had magic an- swers. Computers are here to stay. So are large organizations and the need for data. So is the American commitment to civil liberties. Equally real are the social cleavages and cultural reassessments that mark our era. Our task is to see that appropriate safeguards for individual's right to privacy, con- fidentiality, and due process are embedded in every major record system in 78Ebenstein, Today's Isms 105 (1954) .

That is the statement of pious faith, as well as a review of some of the policy problems of the age. What I question about it- and what Westin and Baker do not grapple with-is the "American commitment to civil liberties." If we are now in a positon, as has been suggested above, that that commitment is more formal than actual, more os- tensible than real, then the technological means for the manipulated society is terrifyingly present. Present also, or at least apparently so, is something less than a burning desire to further individual liberties, including privacy. What Gross and Offe are saying, with Alvin Gouldner, is that there is "a rapid growth and interpénétration of the welfare and police bureaucracies."81 That sentiment has been expressed in economic terms by John Kenneth Galbraith, who in The New Industrial State spoke of a "principle of convergence" of industrialized societies (i.e., the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.) . Galbraith did not meet the problem of individual freedom, but, to repeat, Carl Friedrich has in these terms: "In recent years the destruction of privacy and the expansion of offi- cial secrecy, indeed the whole apparatus of the secret police state, have forced other states to adapt to the world of totalitarianism, to meet their competition with analogous weapons and thus to increase offi- cial secrecy and reduce privacy by the institution of police and inves- tigatory methods." As nations, within themselves, lose their diversity and grow more unified and homogeneous, so it may be said that na- tions tend to resemble each other. Of necessity, those called demo- cratic are forced to take on the characteristics of totalitarian nations, so as to be able to compete in the world arena. To the extent that such a formulation is valid, then freedom (and privacy, perhaps) tends to be a sometime thing, limited in time (to a recent few hundred years at most) and in space (to some of the nations of the West) . The planned society is, in sum, the state of things to come. Planning requires uniform, even unified, policies throughout the nation; and that, in turn, means, control techniques and devices must be imposed so as to achieve desired ends. It means, furthermore, that the State will require increasingly large amounts of data of all types and from all sources. That these two requirements will mean a diminution of free- siOffe, supra note 77, at 487.</page><page sequence="33">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 263 dom and privacy should go without saying. Some will think the price is too high and choose to opt out, insofar as that is possible in a shrink- ing planet. But most will tend to go along. V. IN SUMMATION We have travelled a long road, only to come to a dismal end. But it is dismal only for those, to use T. S. Eliot out of context, "with a set of obsolete réponses." For most people, the lessening of freedom and pri- vacy will not be perceived as a loss, either because they never valued it in the first place or because they have been subtly programmed by societal and cultural pressures. As the Grand Inquisitor well knew,82 man cannot stand the intolerable burden of freedom. Man is con- formist, not individualist (as the American myth would have it) . "The fear of freedom," as Lionel Rubinoff has said, "is greater than the desire for it."83 The Inquisitor said that man requires three things -miracle, mystery, and authority. If it is these, rather than atomistic individualism, that drive man, and particularly man in a mass society, then freedom- and privacy, too- are of little or at least of lessening consequence. Skinner has Fraziov say in Waiden Two: "Most people live from day-to-day They look forward to having children, to see- ing their children grow up, and so on. The majority of people don't want to plan. They want to be free from the responsibility of plan- ning. What they ask is merely some assurance that they will be de- cently provided for. The rest is day-to-day enjoyment of life. That's the explanation of your Father Divines: people naturally flock to any- one they can trust for the necessities of life." By ending on that note of gloom and seeming despair, let me sug- gest merely that it would be wrong indeed to attempt to equate my set of personal values with those of people generally. If that is what people want- really want, as the Grand Inquisitor said- then it ill behooves anyone to say that they should be forced to be free- or pri- vate. "Individualism finds its roots," Philip Slater tells us, "in the at- tempt to deny the reality and importance of human interdependence."84 We are still the prisoners of an obsolete ideology, that of individual- 82The Grand Inquisitor appears in Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov, Bk.

In this transition, "we seek more and more privacy, and feel more and more alienated and lonely when we get it."85 One need not accept that statement of Slater. I would cast it another way: Still intellectual prisoners of the ideology of individualism, we are alienated and lonely; a search for privacy will not alleviate that condition. In this age of collective action, we are beginning to perceive the need for community, for interdependence, for engagement and close interper- sonal relationships. And the law is reflecting that development.

Prof. Miller has recounted the well-known tale that the United States is rapidly advancing to the precipice, is progressing to the stage where a man's dossier has overtaken the eighteenth and nine- teenth century identity of private self, a value which has become the domain of the aristrocrat whose castle boasts a large enough moat to keep out the neighbours, including Papa's State. Prof. Miller suggests that with the end of the new frontier man's openness was corralled until man should now be viewed as a rat in a maze rather than as the heroic stallion of bygone years (I am recalling here the vision of the American dream seen through the prism of Roy Rogers) . America as Superstate has now come to the realization in such documents as The Limits of Growth1 (the much publicized M.I.T. study) that limits must be put on progress in order to impose limits for sane living, a global distribution of just deserts. The welfare state prevails upon us, however, the counterforce that to govern well is to govern broadly. Group well-being, the notion of man as sharer in the corporate identity, is being fostered by governments committed to the notion of distributing goods and resources rather than setting limits on growth per se. The notion of corporate man is connected to the notion that one can plan for man's well-being. This, of course, is followed by the corollary that the centralization of planning is necessary to fulfil the expectations of the welfare state. So Prof. Miller tells us we are in store for a despotism, American style. The law as an ever-growing purposive activity should be re- iMeadows et al., The Limits of Growth (1972) .</page><page sequence="35">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 265 garded as the tool through which the evolutionary bureaucracies of mega-America are fulfilling their national destiny. The resulting condition is the blurring of public and private worlds. To understand the role of law in the context of the teleology of government is to respond to the invitation of Ehrlich to look to the living law as well as the officially stamped rules of the system. Against the background of viewing American state power as organic personhood, which synthesizes its offspring for the benefit of the future children of the state, is the reality that legal jurisprudence, in an era where privacy has become a much bantered word, has pro- duced a paucity of theory to illuminate the concept. Privacy, in Prof. Miller's interpretation, is supported in terms of the surrounding theory that private interests are protected if they further the state, perceived as a super person. The bulk of recent literature on the subject of privacy appears to be oriented in the area of information privacy where the distinction between individual and corporate bodies seems to be collapsed. The concept, however, according to Prof. Miller is broader and encompasses interests in personhood which go beyond mere knowledge about the person by others. In this broader universe of interests, the Supreme Court of the United States (taking cues from the Zeitgeist) may be seen to be pro- tecting the rights of personhood, that is the right of the individual to be protected from State interference, paradoxically, in a fashion which defends the individual in the interest of the public good. In sum the Judiciary has come to service State power and its need for the surveillance of activities which are not deemed to be in the public interest. We have come to appreciate the benefits of the mono- lithic state of progress to the extent that the final arbiters of in- dividual value, the Judiciary, have instinctively been driven to the hop-step of protecting papa's view of instrumentalizing the chil- dren's contributions to the family welfare. The puritan ethos of America, which at one time allowed for the incestuous domination of 'the father over the brood,' has become writ large in the Superstate. The accumulation of data on each and every citizen is ever-increas- ingly essential to the maintenance of peace, order and good govern- ment. The nineteenth century values of individualism have curiously become the rationale of state protectionism, and the cen- tralization of power of information in the hands of the Executive. Prof. Miller comes to the conclusion that privacy is more complex than the privacy (however defined) of the individual, and that it is a fragile concept at best. I take it these conclusions are based on the fundamental observations that privacy insofar as it is evolving as a protective interest in the legal literature must be re-interpreted in the light of "organic" and "group" interests and that privacy is fra- gile from the point of view of individualist definition because of this fact. In this world of centralized power America verges on entrusting to us the model of the new fascism, the inculcation through the em- bracing of the rational (accomplished by the official channels of the</page><page sequence="36">266 ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW Judiciary) , of the substantive and procedural mechanisms for the perfect harmony of parts. Prof. Miller begs to quarrel with the re- cent observation made by Alan Westin in Databanks in a Free So- ciety,2 a study undertaken for the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, that America remains committed to civil liberties. I take it, however, that Prof. Miller does not wish to quarrel with Westin's findings that man is indeed in charge of the machines and will be for the time progression about which we can reasonably con- template. What Prof. Miller is prepared to argue is that if the com- mitment to civil liberties is not deeply ingrained in the culture then the capacity for manipulation is to quote his words 'terrifyyigly present'. But what must strike the reader is that it may not neces- sarily be the case that technology is the basis for the fear but rather the use to which technology might be put by the new guardians. The question that we must pose is whether the technological era which Prof. Miller has painted for us is evil because of the character of American culture or American culture is on the verge of despotism because its polis has turned its evil eye to the available mechanisms of the age. Manual systems of surveillance, it must be remembered, did not hamper the efficiency of the Gestapo to any significant degree nor has it prevented the KGB from keeping a watchful eye on the citizens of the Soviet State. What may be observed is that legal mechanisms such as due process become dysfunctional in a state where the appreciation of private life has become tormented, reflecting the indulgence of the Ameri- can state as a keeper of the vision of democratic values for the globe as well as for its indigenous citizenry. All major empires have collapsed when 'imperialism/ that is the dogmatic universalization of values, reinterpreted the purposiveness of shared expectations within a sovereign community, in the light of world aspirations. When America was truly isolationist constitutional values ultimately came to protect individual rights. Perhaps now that America's cor- porate and military enterprises have become universalist in their implications, the Judiciary, 'qua mirror of the societal values of the Superstate,' at the highest level instinctively protects the State, or the corporate equivalent in power, as the summum bonum, whose in- terests swallow up man's individuality and his capacity for personal redemption in the all-embracing 'public will,' in the name of 'public interests.' The imperial nation states are serving as exemplars of imperial values, of global protectionism of these values, and it is the challenge of the smaller states standing on the periphery of the Big Powers to evolve for themselves models for the decentralization of power so as not to meet with the American end of days. Programmed man and the planned state have become unified in the apocalyptic vision of the American dream. Curiously, it now behooves the developing 2Westin, Alan F. and Michael A. Baker, Databanks in a Free Society (1972) 405.</page><page sequence="37">PRIVACY IN THE MODERN CORPORATE STATE 267 nation states and the smaller industrialized states standing on the threshold of this vision to become interpreters of this dream and to outline for themselves paths which will prevent all roads from lead- ing to Rome. Prof. Miller ends on the optimistic note that our response to the ideology of individualism may be regarded as the quest for "inter- dependence, for engagement in close interpersonal relationships." Clearly this notion of 'human community' must be distinguished from that of 'society.' It may be that our only hope in large techno- cratic states, such as America, with ever-increasing tendencies to the centralization of power (which should be properly understood as the inherent tendency of power elites to control the mass) is the silent testimony of those individuals who have chosen to huddle together to dream for themselves and to encourage the love for man which after all is what distinguishes him from other beings, or more im- portantly, from the Machine, which has become the new symbol of evil and of un trammeled power.
