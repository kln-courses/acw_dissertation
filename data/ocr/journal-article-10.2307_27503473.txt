<plain_text><page sequence="1">Economics, Ecology and Entropy: The Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Limits to Growth Claire Elizabeth Smith Joseph Wayne Smith The University of Adelaide The second law of thermodynamics has played an important role in ecological economics as providing a justification for the view that economies have limits to growth. Yet beyond basic textbooks statements of this law, we seldom find informed philosophical examinations of the meaning and metaphysical justification for the second law. In this paper we shall examine some challenges which have been made to the limits to growth {Limitationist) position by those criticizing the scope and application of the second law of thermodynamics and we shall in turn defend Limitationism against these criticisms. INTRODUCTION One of the most distinguished physicists of the twentieth century, Ar thur Eddington, had this to say about the metaphysical justification of the second law of thermodynamics: The law that entropy always increases?the second law of ther modynamics?holds, I think the supreme position among the laws of Nature. If someone points out to you that your pet the ory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell's equa tions?then so much the worse for Maxwell's equations.

But if your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deep est humiliation (Eddington, 1928, pp.74-75). Perhaps because of this seemingly secure physical foundation the second law of thermodynamics has been used as the ultimate philosophical justi fication for the limits to growth (Limitationist) position (Catton, 1982; Cos tanza (Ed.), 1991; Ehrlich &amp; Ehrlich, 1990; Daly, 1977; Daly (Ed.), 1980; Daly &amp; Cobb, 1989; Georgescu-Roegen, 1966; 1971; 1976; 1979; 1982; Hardin, 1991; 1993). Georgescu-Roegen for example has defined a closed thermodynamic system as one which exchanges no matter and no energy with its environment (Georgescu-Roegen, 1976a). On this basis he claims that matter is subject to irrevocable dissipation just as available energy is continuously transformed into unavailable energy. The material universe is thus subject to irreversible change?downhill. The significance of this for human life is enormous: Every time we produce a Cadillac, we irrevocably destroy an amount of low entropy that could otherwise be used for pro ducing a plow or a spade. In other words, every time we pro duce a Cadillac, we do it at the cost of decreasing the number of human lives in the future. Economic development through industrial abundance may be a blessing for us now and for those who will be able to enjoy it in the near future, but it is definitely against the interest of the human species as a whole, if its interest is to have a lifespan as long as is compatible with its dowry of low entropy. In this paradox of economic develop ment we can see the price man has to pay for the unique privi lege of being able to go beyond the biological limits in his struggle for life (Georgescu-Roegen, 1976b, pp.58-59). Georgescu-Roegen's position is that a world with zero population growth and a steady state economy at current consumption levels is not sustain able in perpetuity and will lead to resource exhaustion in a finite period. The reason for this is that nonrenewable resources tend to irretrievably dissipate. The entropy argument for the limits to growth has not gone without challenge. Jeffrey T. Young has argued that this argument is fundamentally flawed. The reason for this is as follows:</page><page sequence="3">311 CLAIRE ELIZABETH SMITH AND JOSEPH WAYNE SMITH The crux of the argument revolves around the treatment of ma terial resources. This is because the entropy law as a physical principle applies only in a closed system and then only to en ergy. However, since the earth is an open system with respect to energy any inevitable entropie decay or dissipation in the earth which sets a long-run physical limit on economic activity must occur for matter, not for energy. Proponents of the entropy law as a physical constraint on economic growth must show that it applies to matter as well as energy. Georgescu-Roegen, the leading such proponent, is well aware of this. Since the law is about energy it can be extended to matter only by analogy. The 'law', therefore loses its law-like character. Production and con sumption are not required to obey this revised law (Young, 199l,p.169). Edward Goldsmith (1981 a; b) whilst being a famous Limitationist, has de nied that the entropy law applies to behavior within the biosphere. The physicist and philosopher P.J. Zwart (1976) has also denied that the second law of thermodynamics is valid in organic nature for various metaphysical reasons. After a brief examination of the logical structure of the second law of thermodynamics, we shall outline and criticize the arguments of Young, Goldsmith and Zwart. THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS Processes in nature exhibit a direction. Warm bodies cool down rather than spontaneously absorbing heat from the environment. Bodies at rest never spontaneously move: movement occurs only if an external force is applied. Electricity flows from a point where the potential is high towards a point where it is lower, never in the reverse direction, unless an external force is applied. Clausius, one of the pioneers of thermodynamics and re sponsible for the introduction of the function entropy into physics, stated the second law of thermodynamics in this form: heat itself only flows from a point of high temperature towards a point of low temperature and the reverse process cannot occur without energy being expended (Franzen &amp; Gerstein, 1971). This principle is the same for pressure in liquids and gases and for electricity. In nature there is a general trend towards degradation: local differences tend to become spontaneously small and eventually dis appear. (A spontaneous process is one, which once occurring proceeds by itself without further intervention from outside the system.) Systems thus tend towards as low an energy level as it is possible to maintain. This</page><page sequence="4">312 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT tendency towards levelling is necessary for life to occur: the pressure of air is never such that it is a vacuum at one end of your office, with the normal air pressure of (say) sea level at the other end. The warm water in your bath never spontaneously separates into boiling water at one end and freezing cold water at the other. A world where the second law of thermodynamics did not hold, where there was a tendency towards differentiation, would be inconceivable, as there is no maximum which differentiation can reach. Between any two points there would exist differences in pressure, compo sition, temperature etc. that would increase over time. Such a world would disintegrate: uniform structures could not exist and chemical processes would not occur. The universe would be a scattered array of sub-atomic particles that would seldom interact (Zwart, 1976, p.96). Clausius' original definition of entropy was that for any reversible pro cess the increase in entropy S of the system or part of the system equals the heat absorbed, divided by the absolute temperature: (1) dS = 8q rev T More generally: (2) dS = 8q + dS ?rr T where dS, the increase in entropy of the system is given by 8q/T, the en tropy transferred from the surroundings, plus dSirr, the entropy produced as a result of irreversible processes occurring within the system. The second law of thermodynamics can be stated by making use of the concept of the ''entropy change of the universe": \d) A-&gt;total == ?^universe = ^^system ? ^^surroundings Further: (4) AS universe = ASSVS 4- ASsurr &gt; 0 The second law of thermodynamics (4) states that all spontaneous pro cesses produce an increase in the entropy of the universe (Petrucci &amp; Harwood, 1993, p.706). Three other concepts are important in this context: they are open sys tems, closed systems and isolated systems. Open systems exchange both energy and matter with the environment. An (open) cup of hot liquid ex changes heat with its environment and matter in the form of water vapor.</page><page sequence="5">313 CLAIRE ELIZABETH SMITH AND JOSEPH WAYNE SMITH Closed systems exchange energy but no matter with their environment. An enclosed glass flask of hot liquid is an example of a closed system where heat is lost to the environment, but no matter. Finally an isolated system exchanges neither energy nor matter with its environment. Hot liquid in a vacuum flask approximates such a system for short time periods. However, over long time periods heat energy will be slowly transferred (Prigogine, 1961, p.3). The spontaneous freezing of water at temperatures below the freezing point of water (and at "normal" pressures) involves a decrease in entropy as the molecules of water increase their order by forming ice crystals. This process however occurs with a loss of heat to the environment and a lower ing of the level of energy. The Gibbs free energy G of a system is defined by: (5) G = U - TS where U is the internal energy, T is the temperature and S is entropy. An other expression of the second law of thermodynamics is based upon the observation that nature has a tendency towards minimal free energy. The natural tendency of energy to be degraded is true of both open and closed systems: work can be wholly converted into heat but the conversion of heat into work without loss of energy is impossible (Zwart, 1976, p.111). Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906) explained the tendency towards lev elling in the universe on the basis of the tendency of systems to pass from less probable to more probable states. A state which is more probable has by definition a greater chance of realization than a less probable state (Hawking, 1988, pp.145-146). Boltzmann showed that the probability of a state is determined by the degree of order, the less the order, the greater the probability so that the most probable state is one in which disorder is maxi mal. On this account the second law of thermodynamics states that all physical systems have the tendency to pass from a more ordered to a less ordered state. Alternately: "Every system which is left to itself will, on the average, change toward a condition of maximum probability' (Lewis &amp; Randall, 1961, p.92). Entropy was defined by Boltzmann as follows: (6) entropy S = k.ln P where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38054 X 10"23 joule per kelvin). PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Contrary to Eddington there have been physical and philosophical challenges to the alleged universal validity of the second law of thermo</page><page sequence="6">314 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT dynamics. The best known of these is Maxwell's Demon (Prigogine &amp; Sten gers, 1984). We will not discuss this thought experiment here, since it is generally concluded that Maxwell's argument only shows that a minute departure from the second law could occur for a minute time (Lewis &amp; Randall, 1961, p.88). There are however two logical arguments against the validity of the second law, one due to Loschmidt and the other due to Zermelo (Reichenbach, 1991, pp.110-117; Hollinger &amp; Zenzen, 1982) which are worth reviewing. Loschmidt's reversibility objection is as follows. Molecules in motion do not prefer one direction to another, so directions d and ~d are equi probable. Laws governing the motion of molecules are time symmetric?if each molecule reversed the direction of its motion, the system would run through the same states as before but in the reverse order of succession. In a closed system, every state has the same probability as its opposite where molecules move with the same velocity in opposite directions. Hence every state and its opposite must occur equally often. Therefore every pro cess must occur just as often in one direction as in the opposite direction. Hence, the entropy of a closed system must decrease as often as it in creases. Therefore the second law of thermodynamics is false! Zermelo's periodicity objection is as follows. All states of a system have a non-zero probability. Therefore in the long run, the system must return to that state and pass through the same states it previously passed through, leading to the system passing through cycles of the same changes of state. Therefore, over time the entropy of closed systems must decrease as often as they increase. (More technically, a mechanical system de scribed by Hamilton's equations, has an ergodic path which is quasi-peri odic.) In response to the Loschmidt-Zermelo arguments, Zwart has argued, correctly we believe, that mechanical processes such as the motion and collision of objects are not reversible because through friction and collision work is converted into heat: "In all mechanical processes degradation of energy is taking place, which makes them irreversible" (Zwart, 1976, p.114). Zwart replies to Loschmidt's argument by rejecting the premise that a state and its reverse have the same probability, because every actual state is a result of its own causal-history, so that the actual state has a probability of 1 and its reverse a probability of O. Zwart replies to the periodicity objection by pointing out that the probability of an unequal distribution in a system arising purely by chance is diminishingly small, because of the large number of molecules in most systems and the fact that molecules are usually in random motion at high velocities. Most systems would have ceased to exist before violation of the second law occurred by chance. We</page><page sequence="7">315 CLAIRE ELIZABETH SMITH AND JOSEPH WAYNE SMITH add that long time periods do not make the statistically improbable, proba ble. For independent events, the statistically improbable remains by defini tion, statistically improbable. If the unlikely event happens and order is created from disorder, then the most statistically probable thing that would happen next is degeneration, the return to disorder. This is an appropriate place to return to Jeffrey Young's criticism of Georgescu-Roegen. We concur with Young that Georgescu-Roegen's defi nition of a closed system as one which exchanges no matter and no energy with the environment is a nonstandard definition. Yet there is, we believe in the light of the problem of macroscopic irreversibility/microscopic re versibility, epitomized in the Loschmidt-Zermelo arguments, a close con nection between matter and energy. Of course, according to special rela tivity, matter and energy are connected by Einstein's famous equation E = mc2, but even in terms of classical nonrelativity physics there is an intimate connection between matter and energy. For a material object to change its state of motion (or rest) a force must be applied and if a force is applied then energy transfers occur. Contrary to Young, the second law of thermo dynamics tells us that there are no everlasting material structures because matter just as energy, continuously and irrevocably dissipates. This is a theoretical consequence of the entropy law rather than an analytic defini tion. Matter irrevocably dissipates because energy irrevocably dissipates. Consider a burning cigarette. Heat energy of the flame produces a complex series of chemical reactions. Why do we never observe in nature the ash suddenly reconstituting itself into the cigarette? Following Maxwell, Loschmidt and Zermelo, could not the molecules of the ash and smoke suddenly reconstitute the cigarette? Unlike random molecular aggregates such as the gases considered by Maxwell, Loschmidt and Zermelo, macro scopic objects such as cigarettes are complex structures of chemicals. To reconstitute the cigarette from the ash and smoke would involve not merely mechanical changes but chemical changes as well, involving en ergy to break certain chemical bonds and energy to cause other molecules to chemically bond. It could be argued of course that chemical bonds are really completely explicable quantum mechanically, but even so, it does not follow that all that occurs in combustion can be explained totally by reference to the motion of molecules in space-time. For Young, the entropy law is only applicable to open systems. The Earth is an open system. Therefore the entropy law is not applicable to it. Arguing along these lines one could claim that since there are strictly speaking no closed systems in the universe, then the entropy law is strictly false. But this is absurd, for no other reason than that the universe whether finite or infinite is a closed system (excluding God, the universe by d?fini</page><page sequence="8">316 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT t?on has no external physical environment) so the entropy law must be applicable to the universe after all. Systems can be considered as if they were thermodynamically closed because their energy exchange with the external environment is negligible compared to their internal energy flow. The idea of a thermodynamically closed system is an idealization like that of a perfectly rigid body. Young offers what he thinks is a counter-example to the entropy law, for entropy as disorderliness to be decreasing even though the system is closed. The idea here is that low entropy is an anthropomorphic concept defined by current technology. Young's example involves considering two chemical elements found in ore deposits in situ, designated by a and b. Initially only a is considered a resource. This is represented by two boxes A and B, box A containing a and b and box B being empty, indicating that no discharge has occurred. Then Young considers another situation where dis charge occurs and boxes A and B contain a and b, but a technological change occurs making b a resource. These considerations allegedly refute the entropy law. The problem with Young's example is that the concept of "order" is not introduced into the formation of the problem?for all we know the second situation may be more disorderly. However, behind Young's alleged counter-example is a general principle which he shares with JL. Simon (1981) : that knowledge and technology enable us to forever escape the physical bounds of the entropy law. One of us has argued against this position elsewhere (Smith, 1991 ; 1993). Here we note that the entropy law is seen in economics as the law of diminishing returns. Giarini and Louberg? published a book on this topic as it relates to the diminishing returns of technology (Giarini &amp; Louberg?, 1978). There they argued that a complete production function should be defined as follows: (7) Q(t) + W(t) = F [R(t), K(t), L(t), Z(t)] where t is time, Q is output, W pollution, R natural resources and land, K capital, L labor and Z technology. Technology is an autonomous factor of product and it is most unlikely that techno-optimists would disagree. As such the law of diminishing returns applies to it just as it applies to labor and capital. Edward Goldsmith (1981, a; b) has proposed that the entropy law does not apply to the biosphere. Look at evolution he says: . .. either we are all mad and there has not been such a thing as evolution, and the biosphere with its myriad forms of life is an illusion or else the entropy law does not apply to the behaviour</page><page sequence="9">317 CLAIRE ELIZABETH SMITH AND JOSEPH WAYNE SMITH of living things?only to that of hot air in a closed receptacle or steam in a locomotive (Goldsmith, 1981 a, p.179). Goldsmith does not develop this argument in any detail and some of his other arguments against entropy law are fallacious. For example he says that in a closed system the behavior of objects is not always in agreement with the entropy law. A corpse in a closed receptacle will not decompose into its component parts unless the receptacle is open and oxygen is al lowed in! We leave it to the reader to suggest what is wrong with this argument as a refutation of the entropy law. Goldsmith has however touched on an important point in his claim that the second law of thermodynamics is invalid in organic nature. Zwart (1976) agrees and clearly set out his argument in a logical form. He rejects the argument that the second law does not apply to living things because they are open systems, maintaining that in other formulations of the second law not involving the open/closed distinction, the law is very general cov ering all irreversibility in nature. With respect to the Earth's thermodynamic status Zwart says: ... it is certain that the earth gains more energy than it loses, for a great amount of solar energy is absorbed by the green plants and converted into chemical energy. Consequently, we would expect an extra increase in entropy, and certainly not a de crease. Reckoning the net amount of solar energy absorbed to be equal to an amount of heat Q ... the increase of the earth's entropy should, according to thermodynamics, be equal to Q/T. Instead of which we observe a strong growth of order and differ entiation, ?e. a marked decrease of entropy. It would seem, therefore, that the development of life on earth really contra dicts the fundamental principles of thermodynamics (Zwart, 1976, p.125). Zwart considers the process of photosynthesis in plants to be contrary to the second law of thermodynamics. He says: Once again we shall have to look to the plant's environment for compensation, at least if we want to save the unrestricted va lidity of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. As regards the first, the law of the conservation of energy, there is of course no problem at all: the rise in the level of energy of the plant is equal to the energy it has absorbed in the form of sunlight. But in what way is the decrease of entropy in the plant compen sated? As far as I can see, in no way at all. For the conversion of</page><page sequence="10">318 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT the energy of radiation of the sun into chemical energy may certainly not be considered a degradation of that energy. On the contrary, it should rather be considered a promotion, for radia tion is just as random and therefore low a form of energy as heat. ... the conversion of radiation into chemical energy should be considered a promotion of that energy, i.e. a process in which the entropy decreases (Zwart, 1976, pp.127-128). Zwart notes that the only way of saving the validity of the second law of thermodynamics for the system sun + Earth, is to assume that the sun's entropy is continuously increasing. He rejects this assumption on the grounds that in emitting radiation, the sun is cooling down, so its entropy must be decreasing. It can be argued, we believe, that the sun's entropy is increasing?as it ages and tends towards its heat-death. In general it is true that when the temperature of a substance increases the entropy increases as well because increased temperature means increased molecular motion. But the sun is not a burning mass of hydrogen; rather, it is a huge nuclear furnace operat ing by fusion power, where light atomic nuclei fuse to form a heavier nu cleus with the release of large quantities of energy. Rather than decreasing in temperature as huge conventional fires might, the temperature of suns throughout their life increases as they first burn hydrogen fuel in fusion reactions and then heavier elements, until a point is reached where the energy gained from fusion reactions is insufficient to support the star against its own mass. Gravitational forces implode the core of the star, whilst blasting away the outer layer of the star, accompanied by the release of a vast quantity of energy. The core is left as a neutron star or black hole. The entropy of such objects, representing the heat-death of a star, is maxi mal (Davies, 1984, p.178). Therefore the action of the sun confirms, rather than disconfirms the second law of thermodynamics (Layzer, 1990). Erwin Schr?dinger, one of the founders of quantum mechanics, viewed the heat produced by the sun as a "fabulous provision for order," which maintains life on Earth (Schr?dinger, 1957, p.48). In What is Life*. (Schr?dinger, 1944), he argued that organisms maintain their organisation by "sucking orderliness" from their environment. Organisms can be re garded as patterns of thermodynamic flow: the organism 0 exchanges mat ter and energy with its environment, but maintains its state of high neg entropy only by increasing the entropy of its environment ?. The system 0 + ^ will have an increasing degree of entropy over time, provided that the energy influx is constant (Pollard (Ed.), 1984; Weber, Depew &amp; Smith (Eds.), 1988).</page><page sequence="11">319 CLAIRE ELIZABETH SMITH AND JOSEPH WAYNE SMITH The validity of the second law of thermodynamics applied to life pro cesses is not challenged by the work of llya Prigogine on dissipative struc tures and non-equilibrium thermodynamics (Progogine, 1980; Prigogine &amp; Stengers, 1984; Nicolis &amp; Prigogine, 1987). It is beyond the scope of this paper to consider Prigogine's work in more than a cursory fashion, but a detailed consideration will not be needed here to make our point. Pri gogine considers systems undergoing random molecular motions far-from equilibrium, where some form of gradient or flow is established. Central to this concern is the concept of dissipative structures these being systems which are open both in exchanging matter and energy with their environ ments as well as being open in the information-theoretic sense of having the potential to develop new forms of organization from what was essen tially random or chaotic states. The Belousov-Zhabotinskii (B-Z) reaction is an example of such "chaotic" behavior, where in a mixture of sulphuric acid, potassium br?mate, cerium sulphate and malonic acid, oscillations in the concentration of bromide and cerium ions occur (Scott, 1991). Dissipa tive structures such as this only survive as long as energy is supplied, be cause as their name suggests, energy is continually dissipated. Dissipative structures transfer entropy into the environment, so that even though the total entropy of the system organism + environment increases, the dissipa tive structure maintains its order. It does not do this by violating the second law of thermodynamics; on the contrary, it is precisely because of the oper ation of the second law of thermodynamics, that the dissipative structures' order arises. CONCLUSION In this paper we have attempted to clarify the logical structure of the second law of thermodynamics, a task which we believe is important for providing a theoretical basis for the defense of the limits to growth (Limita tionist) position. We have examined some metaphysical and physical chal lenges both to the validity of the second law and Limitationism and con clude that these criticisms are flawed. The Limitationist position, generally underlying most articles in this journal, is both philosophically meaningful and physically sound. REFERENCES Catton, W.R. (1982).
