WESTAWAY Abstract : Results from excavations at the rre-rottery Neolithic A (rrNA) site of Z ahrat adh-Dhra z {LAU Z) in Jordan promise to resolve ambiguity over the introduction of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic В (PPNB) period in the southern Levant . Zahrat adh-Dhra ' 2 is the first southern PPNA site to date exclusively to the late PPNA period (9 600-9 300 BP/ 9 200-8 300 cal ВС). The settlement is a small mound containing a single phase of curvilinear architecture. It has yielded a range of characteristic PPNA material culture items and practices, including evidence of cranial removal, a varied ground stone industry with cup-hole mortars, geometrically incised plaques and pebbles ; and a lithic assemblage which includes bladelet cores, a preponderance ofbladelets, borers, Beit Та ' amir sickles, Hagdud truncations, picks, edge-ground axes, and tranchet axes. It lacks typical PPNB features such as naviform blade core technology, and notched and tanged projectile points. It also bears evidence for a subsistence economy based on hunting, gathering and the cultivation of cereals and possibly legumes (so-called "pre-domestication cultivation "). ZAD 2 casts doubt upon the authenticity of a prominent chronological scheme which places the southern Levantine Early PPNB phase dating from (9 600-9 200 BP/ also 9 200-8 300 cal ВС). Details of the radiocarbon dates obtained for ZAD 2 and their relationship to the stratigraphie order of the site are given here. Never- theless, a marked plateau on the early Holocene part of the radiocarbon calibration curve renders it difficult to sequentially order cali- brated dates within the 9 600-9 200 BP period, and thus to distinguish between the alternative chronological schemes. In the future, Bayesian modeling of date sequences from individual sequences may assist in this regard. Bayesian modeling of the ZAD 2 dates was undertaken here in order to estimate a likely occupational span for the site. This analysis suggests that the occupation of ZAD 2 can be constrained to the period 8 800-8 450 cal ВС. Yet more recently discovered than ZAD 2, a new phase at the site ofMotza in Israel prom- ises to further elucidate the question of the EPPNB in the southern Levant. With these fresh perspectives newly at hand, we review evi- dence from several southern Levantine sites previously claimed as exemplars of the southern EPPNB. We also examine their relation to Syrian Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites ; in particular Dja ' de al-Mughara and the new work at Tell Aswad in the Damascus Basin which has radically altered our understanding of that site and weakened its pivotal importance as a reference point for the southern Levantine PPNA and EPPNB. We conclude that, according to the debate as it has been played out in the uncalibrated chronology, the EPPNB phase originated in north Syria around 9 600 BP and the southern Levantine PPNB began around 9 350/9 300 BP. Résumé : La fouille du site PPNA de Zahrat adh-Dhra ' 2 (ZAD 2), en Jordanie, devrait contribuer à résoudre l ' ambiguïté existante sur l'origine du PPNB au Levant sud. ZAD 2 est le premier site PPNA qui appartient exclusivement à la dernière phase du PPNA (9 600- 9 300 BP/ 9 200-8 300 cal ВС). Ce petit établissement comporte une seule phase architecturale présentant des structures curvilignes ; il a livré des indices sur les pratiques funéraires (avec attestation de dépôt des crânes). La culture matérielle comporte notamment des mortiers ainsi que des plaques et des pierres incisées ; l'industrie lithique, lamellaire, comporte des perçoirs, des couteaux de Beit Taa- mir («faucilles »), des troncatures ď Hagdud, des pics, des haches polies et des trancheis. En revanche les éléments caractéristiques du PPNB, comme les nucléus naviformes, les pointes de projectiles à pédoncules et ailerons, sont absents. Des traces de culture de céréales et probablement de légumineuses sont présentes (« agriculture prédomestique »). Les datations obtenues pour ZAD 2 sont ici données en relation avec la stratigraphie du site. Néanmoins, la courbe de calibration est marquée au début de l 'Holocène par un plateau qui rend tant la mise en ordre chronologique des dates calibrées pour la période 9 600-9 200 BP que la distinction entre les différents sché- Paléorient, vol. 30/2, p. 2 1 -60 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 Manuscrit reçu le H octobre 2004, accepté le 16 décembre 2004</page><page sequence="2">22 P.C.

Cette analyse suggère que l'occupation se limite à la période 8 800-8 450 av. J.-C. (calibré). La découverte récente à Motza (Israël) d ' une nouvelle phase devrait permettre de clarifier la question du PPNB ancien au Levant sud. Ces nouvelles perspectives permettent de réexaminer plusieurs sites du Levant sud précédemment considérés comme des modèles du PPNB ancien. Examen est aussi fait de leur relation avec les sites du Néolithique précéramique de Syrie, particulièrement avec Dja'de el Mughara, et avec les résultats obtenus récemment à Tell Aswad dans le bassin de Damas. Ceux-ci ont changé radicalement notre interprétation de ce site et affaibli son impor- tance comme site de référence pour le PPNA et le PPNB ancien du Levant sud. Pour conclure, en chronologie non calibrée, le PPNB trouverait son origine en Syrie du Nord vers 9 600 BP et débuterait au Levant sud autour de 9 350-9 300 BP.

In view of recent uncertainties about the nature of the pas- sage from the PPNA to the PPNB in the Levant, the dating of the new PPNA Jordanian site of Zahrat adh-Dhra' 21 (hereaf- ter ZAD 2 ; fig. 1) to 9 600-9 300 BP/ 9 200-8 300 cal ВС is a significant outcome, because the site slots neatly into the problematic time frame of 9 600-9 200 BP / 9 200-8 300 cal ВС proposed for the "Early PPNB" (EPPNB) period of the southern Levant2. The EPPNB in Jordan was advanced on the basis of several sites in the southern Levant, but particularly in regard to Tell Aswad in southern Syria, and ultimately to the appearance of the EPPNB at Mureybet in north Syria around 9 600 BP / 9 200 cal ВС3. However, the putative EPPNB in the southern Levant has hitherto lacked convincing dated or excavated archaeological sites with which to fill it. Even before the excavation of ZAD 2, Kuijt4 had made a strong case that the PPNA in the southern Levant persisted until 9 300-9 200 BP / 8 300 cal ВС. Moreover, the results 1.

Instead, the focus in the search for a southern EPPNB has shifted to the new results from the site of Motza, near Jerusalem in Israel6. Just as ZAD 2 fills the first part of the (uncalibrated) chronological lacuna of 9 600-9 300 BP ; so Motza (dated ca 9 350-9 100 BP) completes the second part. With these new developments in the south, and new work on the north Syrian PPNB also providing fresh perspectives, it seems an opportune time to review the PPNA-PPNB transi- tion, which coincided with major intensifications in human settlement, subsistence and social-cultural practices. In order to clarify the position of ZAD 2, we initially present here comprehensive reports on its assemblages of cultural and eco- nomic materials resulting from the first two excavation sea- sons (1999 and 2001), emphasizing details of the chronostratigraphy in support of our contentions. The site has yielded a range of PPNA features such as curvilinear architec- ture, a detached human cranium, a varied ground stone indus- try which includes cup-hole mortars, incised pebbles ; and a lithic assemblage which includes bladelet cores and a prepon- derance of bladelets, borers, Beit Ta' amir sickles, Hagdud truncations, picks, edge-ground axes, and flaked tranchet axes. Before elucidating ZAD 2' s material characteristics, we begin by describing its unusual environs on the Dead Sea Plain which are integral to understanding the site and its nature. 5.

These sterile geological substrates constrain the agri- cultural productivity of the limited patches of stony alluvium, although overlying Pleistocene alluvial gravels10, situated to the south of Wadi adh-Dhra4, offer limited agricultural poten- tial, and are today utilised for market gardens with the aid of fertilizers and irrigation. The Dead Sea Plain slopes gently towards the Dead Sea, and is incised by numerous ravines and gorges. The regional extremes of low elevation, high temper- atures and insignificant annual rainfall1 1 are mitigated by the 'Ain Wai'da spring, whose waters rise at the Jordan Valley margin and flow westward along Wadi adh-Dhra'. 9. KHALIL, 1992 : 42ff. 10. HOUSE, 2003. 1 1. AL-EISAWI, 1985 ; NIEMI et al ., 1997. The erosive phase that resulted in the modern incised channel of Wadi adh-Dhra' occurred sometime after 1 700 ВС, this chronological benchmark being confirmed by the incision of the wadi through the neighbouring Middle Bronze II A-B site of ZAD 1 12 . During its occupation, however, ZAD 2 lay on a gently sloping plain with easy approaches, over which meandered palaeochannel(s) of Wadi adh-Dhra'. Therefore, access to water would have been unproblematic and the positioning of any cultivated plots to take advantage of the water straightforward. While the southern Levant may have been somewhat moister in the early Holocene than now13, the hyperarid Dead Sea Plain was unlikely thus to have been transformed into a Mediterranean phytogeographic zone supporting edible cere- als, legumes and nut trees. Its low altitude must have gov- erned a persistently negligible rate of precipitation, and moreover the barren evaporitic sediments that underlay and surround ZAD 2 are unlikely to have provided suitable sub- strates for many important Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian food plants. In this respect, the Zahrat adh-Dhra' region forms a useful natural laboratory in which to investigate the possi- bility of "pre-domestication cultivation", because it indicates that the major food plants used at ZAD 2 (figs, pistachios, pulses and barley) must have been either gathered and brought into the site from the Mediterranean highlands several kilo- metres to the east, or else cultivated near the site. Further consideration of this key subject is developed by John Meadows below. Firstly, we present the site's strati- graphic details in some detail (Phillip Edwards), then present a Bayesian analysis of the radiocarbon date series (John Meadows). Details of the material culture are also given, including the lithic component (Ghattas Sayej) and a brief description of the human skeletal remains (Michael Westa- way). STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF ZAHRAT ADH-DHRA' 2 ZAD 2 is a small mound about two metres thick and 2 000 square metres in area14. Surface traces of seventeen curvilin- ear hut structures cut the surface. Excavations have revealed 12. BERELOV, 2001 ; FALCONER et al., 2001. 13. BARUCH and ВОТТЕМА, 1999. 14.

A suite of nine radiocarbon dates have been obtained which span the period 9 600-9 300 BP / 9 200-8 300 cal ВС. STRUCTURE 1 (SQUARE E28) Structure 1 is a small, round stone hut located on the west- ern edge of the settlement. Truncated by erosion to the west, its surviving portion remains as a shallow curvilinear stone wall two to three courses high. A sondage effected below Structure 1 (Square E 28) revealed a series of interleaved, red and dark grey deposits ( Loci 1-23) which appear to represent refuse tip lines. Artefact density decreased gradually with depth, until natural Dana Conglomerate Formation sediments ( Locus 24) were encountered at 1.20 m below the surface (fig. 4). While no artefacts were encountered in the Dana Conglomerate, the remains of an infant's skull were found in a small pit (Locus 25) dug some 10 centimetres deep into the natural layers. Although the deposits in Square E28 cannot be directly correlated to the floor layers of the dwellings in Struc- ture 2 and 3, Sayej (see below) has divided them into analyti- cal units of "upper" ( Loci 1-9) and "lower" ( Loci 10-26), in order to monitor the vertical distribution of stone artefacts in this area. STRUCTURE 2 (SQUARES К 22 - L 23) Structure 2 is enclosed by a long curvilinear stone wall (F. 1 ), which arches from the northwest in Square J 22 to the southeast in Square К 24 (fig. 5). In Squares О 26-27 it returns sharply to the northeast. A single-coursed stone wall (F. 6) oriented south-east was connected to the exterior of Feature 1 after the construction of Structure 2 (Squares N/O -28). To the north, Feature 1 returns to the east in Square J 2 1 . A clan- destine excavation pit precluded clarification of any further continuation of the wall to the northeast, but excavations in Square P 2 1 demonstrated no linkage of the northern and east- ern parts of the curvilinear wall, indicating the placement of an entrance in this area. This is considered especially likely as the wall-section in Square Q 22 stops abruptly, and is finished to a squared face. The uppermost occupational phase in Structure 2 (Phase 1 ) was associated with a plastered floor ( Locus 3.1), inset with a stone hearth (F. 4) fixed with plaster. Three additional floors Palcorient, vol. 30/2, p. 21-60 * CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 Fig. 3 : Site plan of Zahrat adh-Dhra ' 2. (Phases 2-4) were superimposed between Phase 1 and the nat- ural sediments some 60 centimetres below (fig. 6). The sec- ond floor, Locus 4.1, (Phase 2) was varied in character, ranging from a hard plastered surface in the south to softer brown sediments in the north. A low, single coursed wall of mortared stone and mudbricks (Feature 3 = F. 3) divided the two areas. The hearth (F. 4), initially encountered in Phase 1, proved to be founded on the underlying floor of Phase 3 ( Locus 5.1). In the course of excavations beneath Phase 3, a new feature emerged : a U-shaped stone platform abutting the main wall. This was probably an earlier hearth and it rested on the Phase 4 floor ( Locus 6.1). The bottom of the wall (F. 1) was associated with this lowest floor, and final excavation revealed the encasing wall as a six-coursed, double-rowed, well-mortared limestone construction surviving to a height of 0.8 m. No foundation trench was discovered at its base,</page><page sequence="6">26 P.C. Edwards, J. Meadows, G. Sayej and M. Westaway Fig. 4 : South baulk section of Square E 28 in Structure I, Zahrat adh-Dhra ' 2. although hard mortar and a number of stones associated with the base of the wall may have functioned to stabilize it. Finally, excavations in К 22 reached the natural Dana Con- glomerate at about 90 cm below surface sediments. This (Locus 7.1) consisted of a shelf of hard, lithified Dana sedi- ments sloping up to the north. In summary, Structure 2 has a "teardrop" plan opening to the east, with its major axes measuring 7 m in length. The eastern wall of Structure 2 swings round to the southeast, apparently to continue as Structure 3, though this awaits clar- ification through further excavation. THE MULTIPLE BURIAL (F. 5) IN SQUARES I- J-K 25 A multiple burial (F. 5) was positioned in the interstices between the wall of Structure 2 (Wall 1) and another (F. 2) which abuts it and then curves away to the west (fig. 5). Here, a small cairn of stones (Square J 24) overlay a complete human skull (in Square J 25). Remains of two further individ- uals were subsequently discovered, attested by two additional mandibles, the whole series associated with a cluster of sec- ondarily deposited long bones. No burial pit was visible. The bones were embedded in dark and friable ashy deposits throughout, and deposited in fill on the uppermost surface outside Structure 2. The burial continued west into Square I 25 and further in the direction of a clandestine excavation pit. Many artefacts were recovered from the shallow deposits, the most notable being a small stone phallic figurine (fig. 16). STRUCTURE 3 (U-V 22) Two squares (U-V 22) were positioned at the summit of the site in order to investigate the deepest deposits of the site. Phase 1 extended to the base of Locus 2. 1 , about 40 cm below the surface, where a hearth (F. 3) rich in charcoal was found associated with a floor (fig. 7). This capped the underlying Structure 3 which consisted of a curvilinear wall curving east to west from Square V 22 to U 22, with an interior floored sur- face (surface of Locus 7.3) some 25 cm below the exterior one in the eastern part of the structure (Phase 2). The underlying Phase 3 was represented by a single floor (the matrix of Locus 7.3) ; Phase 4 was represented by the underlying floor ( Loci 7.4 = 5.4), before the natural Dana Conglomerate (Locus 7.5) was finally encountered. Like Structure 2, the base of the main wall (F. 1) of Structure 3 was not set into a foundation trench, but laid on a mortar base. The Structure 3 wall was dis- mantled in Square V22, showing that the stones were set into copious, hard mortar layers. Two sharply defined and super- imposed white plaster floors were encountered here, one asso- ciated with the external base of F. 1 . STRUCTURE 4 (SQUARES K11-Q10) Structure 4 is located in the northern part of ZAD 2 ; exca- vations tracking a large curvilinear wall segment (F. 1) run- ning in a northwest to northeast direction (fig. 8). In Squares P 10-11 and Q 10 the wall was found to be only one course Paléorient, vol. 30/2, p. 21-60 € CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004</page><page sequence="7">From the PPNA to the PPNB : new views from the Southern Levant after excavations at Zahrat adh-Dhra' 2 in Jordan 27 Fig. 5 : Structures 2 and 3 in the southern part of Zahrat adh-Dhra ' 2.

On the interior of Structure 4 (Squares L-0 1 1 ) the single-coursed wall was associated with a cobble- stone floor composed of pebbles and small stones. Structure 4 is less well preserved than its more southerly counterparts, a situation attributable to its position near the edge of the mound where deposits are thinner. SUMMARY OF ZAD 2 ARCHITECTURE Zahrat adh-Dhra' 2 was a relatively short-lived settlement of round and teardrop-shaped stone huts, containing a singfe constructional phase in Structure 1 , 2 and 3. That is not to say that all dwellings were built simultaneously. Rather, the way that Structure 2 overlaps Structure 3 and the later exterior walls abutting Structure 2 (e.g. F. 6) indicate that the hut structures were augmented overtime. Within individual struc- tures there are multiple floor phases - up to four in the cases of Structure 2 and 3. Structures 1, 2 and 3 were dug though to sterile deposits at about 1 m below the surface, showing that the low rise of the mound ( ca 1-2 m) is partially natural. RADIOCARBON RESULTS FROM ZAHRAT ADH-DHRA' 2 If possible, radiocarbon samples should be selected in series so as to be testable against stratigraphie order, and should preferably sample the full extent of archaeological phases under investigation15. In selecting radiocarbon sam- ples for ZAD 2, we attempted to fulfill these criteria as far as possible. Nine AMS radiocarbon dates were acquired (table 1), all consisting of small, chunky wood charcoal frag- ments, which were present throughout the site. Some of these have been identified as branches and twigs of pistachio (cf. Pistacia sp.) trees16. In the case of Structures 1, 2 and 3 it was feasible to select charcoal samples from superposed layers. Structure Г s lowest sample (9 552 ± 59 BP, Wk-9455) comes from the basal occupation layer of Square E 28, (Locus 22.3), above the infant skull remains dug into the Dana Con- glomerate (fig. 4). A result of 9 635 ± 59 BP (Wk- 9633) comes from Locus 20. 1 , stratified some 1 5-20 cm higher than Locus 22.3. Structure 2 yielded three superimposed AMS dates (fig. 6). The latest is 9 323 ± 59 BP (Wk-9444) from a deposit (Locus 3.2, Square L 23) underlying the uppermost floor. The next result of 9 623 ± 91 BP (Wk-9568) comes from the layer beneath (Locus 3.3, Square K22). The final date of 9 603 ± 59 BP (Wk-9447) is from the earliest and lowest of Structure 2' s four floors (Square K22, Locus 6.1). Structure 3 yielded four superimposed radiocarbon results (fig. 7). The lowermost is 9 528 ± 61 BP (Wk-9570) from the lowermost floor (Locus 5.4=7.4, Square U22). The two over- lying results of 9 440 ± 50 BP (OZE-606) and 9 470 ± 50 BP (OZE-607) come from the Locus 1.2 deposit overlying the 15. BAR-YOSEF, 2000 ; BRUINS, 2001 ; KUIJT, 2003. 16. rers. comm.

BAYESIAN MODELLING OF THE ZAD 2 RADIOCARBON DATES Kuijt17 has observed that when the available dates from the southern Levant are calibrated, the PPNA-PPNB chrono- logical gap is no longer apparent. The utilization of uncali- brated radiocarbon dates is problematic in this period, which coincides with a marked "flat spot" or "plateau" on the den- drochronological calibration curve18. The ZAD 2 dates also correspond directly with the early Holocene flat spot. Such large date ranges are produced through the calibration of radiocarbon results from sites in our period of interest (9 600- 9 200 BP), that forming ordered chronological sequences between sites may not be feasible. Recently, improved radiocarbon measurement precision and the availability of Bayesian chronological modelling soft- ware have raised expectations that archaeological phenomena 17. KUIJT, 2003. 18. AURENCHE et al ., 2001 : 1200 ; BAR-YOSEF, 2000 ; EDWARDS and HIGHAM, 2001. Paléorient, vol. 30/2, p. 21-60 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 might be dated more precisely, allowing some explanations to be supported and others rejected. Bayesian statistical infer- ence proceeds by estimating the conditional probability of the occurrence of an event (its posterior probability) based on information known about a previous event (the prior probabil- ity)19. The Bayesian approach to chronological model build- ing is based on the premise that although calibrated radiocarbon results accurately estimate the ages of individual samples, archaeologists are interested in the dates of events associated with the samples, rather than in the dates of the samples themselves20. In particular, where we believe that a group of radiocarbon samples represents a continuous but finite period of activity (such as the occupation of a site), we can estimate the dates of the start and end of this period, if we assume that the actual dates of the samples were evenly scat- tered throughout the period. Moreover, if the samples' rela- tive ages are known (or can reasonably be assumed) from their stratigraphie relationships, we can use this information to further constrain the estimated calendar date of each sam- ple. The ZAD 2 radiocarbon results were included in several Bayesian models, using the program OxCal 3.521. Such esti- mates, which by convention are always expressed in italics, are not absolute, and would change if further radiocarbon data were added to the model, or if the model were altered to include additional information about the relative ages of the samples. Four models are illustrated (figs 9-12). MODEL 1 The first model (fig. 9) shows the calibration of these results by the probability method22.

No other informa- tion about the relative ages of samples is included in the model. This version estimates probability distributions for the dates of the start and end of the period of occupation (i.e. ZAD 2 start and ZAD 2 end), and shows posterior density estimates of the calendar dates of the radiocarbon samples (which must be more recent than the start date and older than the end date).

Use of phase bounda- ries in OxCal can give misleading results23, but we feel that in this case it is justified. We cannot be certain that the samples dated were evenly drawn from the whole period of occupa- tion, any more than we can be sure that the charcoal fragments dated were not appreciably older than the deposits in which they were found. When the phenomenon to be dated (in this case, the occupation of the site) is relatively short-lived, how- ever, compared to the uncertainty in the unmodelled cali- brated dates, not constraining the modelled dates with boundaries can also be misleading24. Due to the flatness of the calibration curve in this period, the unmodelled calibrated dis- tributions (fig. 9) are wide and multimodal. The unbounded stratigraphie model (Model 4, fig. 12) is therefore likely to produce an exaggerated estimate of the duration of occupa- tion, as there are many possible permutations that the OxCal software can produce. A further consideration is the risk that a significant intrin- sic wood age could be incorporated into the radiocarbon results for all samples. This risk, and the risk that some of the dated samples were dispersed from their primary contexts, suggests that use of stratigraphically-inferred age relation- ships between samples (Models 3 and 4) is less preferable. Adding wood-age offsets to the models could be done, but would require a number of bridging assumptions which are 23. STEIER and ROM, 2000. 24. BRONK RAMSEY, 2000. Paléorient, vol. 30/2, p. 21-60 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 unclear. Even if this could be done satisfactorily, it would make little difference to the results, because the calibrated dis- tributions are so broad. Moreover, the presence of an intrinsic wood age should only strengthen our argument, because the site could thereby have persisted for some time later than the radiocarbon results suggest. As the issue at stake is how late the PPNA continued in Jordan, the uncertainty works in our favour. Model 2 therefore provides the preferred scenario (fig. 10) in which ZAD 2 was occupied beyond 8 800 cal ВС and as late as 8 450 cal ВС. In the future, Bayesian modelling of date sequences from individual sites may assist to resolve the problematic PPNA- PPNB transition, but this more extensive analysis is beyond the scope of this paper. Such work must await the publication of relevant radiocarbon dates contextualised within site strati- graphies. This is a state of affairs which will be best handled by the various site excavators who are most familiar with the nuances of their stratigraphie records. Alternatively, a unified research project might conceivably gain permission to draw together such stratigraphie records and integrate them into a comprehensive Bayesian framework of analysis. LITHIC TECHNOLOGY AND TYPOLOGY OF ZAHRAT ADH-DHRA' 2 Two seasons of excavations at ZAD 2 have yielded an abundant flaked stone assemblage in flint, supplemented by a few pieces of quartz and obsidian, and a diverse groundstone assemblage made from basalt, limestone and sandstone25. Geological prospection of the Zahrat adh-Dhra' region indi- cates that all raw stone materials found at the site, besides the obsidian, are local. The Dana Conglomerate Formation which surrounds ZAD 2 contains massive veins of flint cobbles, used through time as flint quarries26, and this inexhaustible supply of ready flint lies only a 10-minute walk from the site. Furthermore, flint pebbles originating in the Dana Conglom- erate veins wash down through Wadi adh-Dhra', and are widely scattered over ZAD 2 and in its vicinity. A total of 146 626 pieces were recovered from Structures 1-4 (table 3). It is evident that the majority of lithics came from the uppermost layers of ZAD 2, with lithic density decreasing noticeably and consistently with depth in Struc- 25. SAYEJ, 2003. 26.

The "Debitage" class comprises 6.9 % of the total recovered lith- ics at ZAD 2 and comprises flakes (74.2 %), bladelets (22.4 %) blades (1.0 %) and core trimming elements (2.4 %). The debitage component is proportionally less than what is recorded from Netiv Hagdud (27.2 %,), Wadi Feinan (37.6 %) and Dhra' (43 %)28. It is intriguing to note that these proportions for the various sites differ so much. For example, Dhra' is equally as close as ZAD 2 to the Zahrat adh-Dhra' flint quarries. Most cores range between 30-70 mm in length (199 speci- mens) with only 17 larger and 13 smaller than this. Analyses of the cores demonstrate that the majority of them (107) are pyramidal or conical single platform bladelet cores (flg. 1 3 : a, c) while 25 have two platforms (fig. 13 : b) and 23 have mul- tiple platforms ; platforms are missing on 74 fragmentary specimens. The average number of invasive flake scars ema- nating from platforms are 5 per core. The majority of these are flake scars (131 cases), whereas 98 cores predominantly bear blade and bladelet scars. Additional to the small scars result- ing from platform trimming, 78 cores were further retouched and used as tools. High proportions of cortex on both cores and many flaked elements supports the idea that the local cob- bles provided the main source for flaking flint elements29. The character of the cortex and the predominantly brown flint col- our of the cores is also reflected in specimens of flint collected from the Zahrat ad-Dhra' quarries. 28.

TYPOLOGY The retouched tools comprise 1.1 % of the total lithic assemblage. In contrast to PPNB assemblages, where blade blanks generally dominate the retouched tool component, ZAD 2's retouched tools are almost equally manufactured from flakes (53 %) and bladelets (47 %), which is a typical PPNA pattern30. The retouched component incudes typical PPNA types (table 5) such as tranchet axe/adzes (fig. 13 : d), borers (fig. 13 : e), Beit Ta'amir sickles (fig. 14 : d), scrapers, notches (fig. 14 : e), burins, Hagdud truncations (fig. 14 : f-1), - but only a few fragments of apparent tanged projectile points, and even these few are doubtful as to their likely mor- phology (fig. 14 : a-c). A few small invasively flaked points also occur (fig. 15). In contrast to other contemporaneous sites, ZAD 2 has a very low proportion of projectile points, and this raises many questions concerning the nature of its economy. At ZAD 2 they constitute only 0.6 % of the retouched tools, and most of them are broken, whereas at Dhra' they make up 53.5 % ; with 24.3 % at WF 16 and finally 3 % at Netiv Hagdud31. These results might be taken to suggest that hunting was not a major preoccupation for the inhabitants of ZAD 2, whereas the quantities of ground stone equipment and botanical remains imply an emphasis on plant food processing. ZAD 2 and Dhra' completely lack geometric microliths (specifically lunates), while WF 16 has 25.4 % (of retouched tools) and Netiv Hagdud has 13 %. Because microliths were part of the continuity in flint knapping technologies between the late Natufian and the early Neolithic periods32, the ques- tion arises as to whether Netiv Hagdud and WF 16 date to an 30.

Subject to the lim- itations discussed above on the interpretive potential of cali- brated radiocarbon dates, the radiocarbon dates support ZAD 2 as a late PPNA site. Sixty-one Hagdud truncations occur among the retouched tools, which constitutes the second largest raw number recov- ered in the southern Levant after Netiv Hagdud (63 speci- Fig. 14 : Flint artefacts from Zahrat adh-Dhra ' 2 : (a-c) fragmentary projectile points, (d) Beit Та 'amir sickle, (e) piece with opposed notches, (f-l) Hagdud truncations. mens)33, but by far the highest proportional quantity (3. 7 %). Notably, the Hagdud truncations occur without any allied pro- jectile points (that is, El Khiam, Helwan or Salibiya types). This is an important point because Hagdud truncations have been previously conjectured to be stages in the manufacture of these sorts of points, or lithic components of composite pro- jectiles34.

The Hagdud truncations have steep to semi-steep retouch on distal and proximal ends, and vary from roughly square in shape to exceedingly short slivers (fig. 14 : f-1), a phenomenon we have suggested may have resulted from sharpening of the tools while hafted. The same sorts of retouched tools are found throughout all phases of the site, with no indication of temporally ordered change. The overriding feature of the vertical distribution, by phase, is the prominence of most specimens in the uppermost phase in each structure ; a consequence of the earlier-men- tioned predominance of all lithics in the uppermost layers of the site. The techno-typological features of the ZAD 2 assem- blage lack any of the PPNB characteristics such as bipolar naviform blade cores ; long, parallel-sided blades or "upsi- lon" blades ; regular heat treatment ; Jericho points, Byblos points or Amuq points. Conversely it does show strong con- nections to many dated PPNA sites such as Dhra4, WF 16, and Netiv Hagdud36, and the groundstone assemblage points to the same conclusion. 35.

Westaway GROUNDSTONE ARTEFACTS The remains of 6 pestles were found during the second season of excavation with three made from sandstone, two from basalt and one from limestone. Only one pestle was complete. A hammerstone made from limestone and one cup- hole mortar made from sandstone were also recovered. No querns were found in deposits during this season, contrary to their abundance on the surface of the site. In contrast to the surface collection of 35 groundstone specimens37, those recovered during the first two season of excavation were much fewer in quantity and quality. The excavations have also produced parts of four small limestone bowls. EXOTIC ARTEFACTS AND MATERIALS Exotic materials fall into three categories. The most abun- dant are many fragments of copper ore, including many pieces of chrysocolla, occasionally faceted into small prisms or loz- enges. This material occurs over the surface of the site and throughout the deposits. A likely origin for it is the Wadi Fay- nan area some 60 km to the south, which possibility we are currently investigating. There are a few tiny flakes of dark grey obsidian. We are also currently investigating whether these, as might be expected38, derive from a central Cappado- cian source. There are also a few short segments of smooth- bodied Dentalium shells, either from the Mediterranean or Red Seas. FIGURINES, ENGRAVED ITEMS AND ORNAMENTS The Feature 5 burial yielded an ambiguous object (RN 010036), which might alternatively be classified as a small stone phalliform figurine (fig. 16), or perhaps even as an example of Wright's "bell-shaped muller"-type39, found in association with the long bones. A small ceramic segment, perhaps intended to be a human limb, was found during arte- fact processing. Two limestone fragments are incised ; from 37. Edwards et al., 2001. 38.

Structure 2 came a small broken plaque (RN 990001) with its surviving portion adorned with 1 5 vertical strokes, drawn per- pendicularly from a band of 4 horizontal strokes (fig. 17) ; and from Structure 1 a limestone fragment (RN 990002), possibly the rim of small broken bowl, incised with seven notches (fig. 18). Small beads have occur ; one made from an uniden- tified red stone (RN 0 1 00 1 9) and a second fashioned from an unknown marine shell (RN 010020, fig. 19). The specimens resemble each other closely in size and type, being 4-5 mm in maximum diameter with a small hole bored though the centre.

Else- where, PPNA communities apparently continued to rely on gathered wild plant foods for their subsistence41. Experimen- tal work42 has shown that the mutations that define the domes- tic varieties of cereals, while occurring naturally, could only become dominant under certain methods of cultivation, and would be selected against by the harvesting of naturally occurring wild stands. In order for the plant domesticates to become established, therefore, there must have been a period of "pre-domestication cultivation", in which the wild ances- tors of the domestic crops were intentionally cultivated.

This report is based on the processing by manual flotation of 133 samples, comprising 393 litres of sediment43. Samples ranged in volume from 0.5 to 6.5 litres. Only 105 samples were analysed, however, as the preservation of plant remains in the upper 30-40 cm of the site was very poor. Sorting was done under a binocular microscope with x 10 - x 50 magnifi- cation. The results are presented in table 6, which shows the counts of each plant taxon by locus , and two measures of ubiquity : the percentage of analysed samples in which each taxon was identified, and the percentage of loci in which it was found. For the purpose of this report, data from all samples with the same locus number in adjoining squares were combined. This effectively reduced the number of samples to 39, the number of distinct archaeological contexts from which archaeobotanical samples were taken and sorted. Repeatedly sampling the same context, without combining data from those samples, can create false patterns of ubiquity. Locus richness (the number of identifiable taxa in each locus) was directly related to sample size and density (the number of identifications per litre of sediment in each locus).

Edwards, J. Meadows, G. Sayej and M. Westaway although the number of new taxa did not increase as rapidly as the total count44. The densest and richest were floor deposits on the south- eastern side of Structure 2. Some loci in Structure 1 were also relatively dense and rich. The most commonly identified food plant was pistachio {Pistacia sp.), with nutshell fragments in almost every locus with identifiable plant remains. Nutlets (seeds) of wild fig Ç Ficus sp.) were almost as widespread. Barley ( Hordeum sp.) was also widespread, but wheat (Triti- cum sp.) was identified in only a third of loci. Cereal grain fragments that were too broken to identify further were found in most loci. Three types of pulses - lentil {Lens sp.), a pea / vetch type (Fabaceae Sect. Vicieae) and a grass pea type (cf. Lathyrus sp.) - were identified. There were pulse fragments in most loci. Most of the indeterminate pulse fragments probably belong to either the pea / vetch or grass pea types, as frag- ments of lentil are more readily identifiable in cross-section. Lentils were found in only a third of loci. Grasses other than wheat and barley {Avena sp., Bromus sp., Poa sp., Stipa sp., Setaria sp. and others) were common, with seeds, seed fragments or awn fragments in two-thirds of all loci. Nevertheless, non-cereal grasses were represented in only about half the samples, compared to the 94 % of samples with some cereal remains. The difference may reflect usage ; it is possible that cereals were stored for year-round use, while other grasses were not. All other plant taxa are less frequent. A third of loci include very small numbers of small-seeded legumes, while between a fifth and a quarter of loci include charred seeds of Aizoon hispanicum, Ornithogalum-type , Plantago sp. and Chenopodiaceae. No other taxon occurs in more than three loci. Two adjoining loci in Structure 2 contained over 500 seeds of an unknown type, possibly a species of Liliaceae. In summary, every locus sampled with a dozen or more identifications produced evidence of four categories of plant foods : cereals (barley and/ or wheat), pulses (lentil, pea/ vetch and/ or grass pea), pistachio and fig. Pistachio nutshell, which was probably used for fuel, may be over-represented. The regularity with which fig and pistachio remains were found suggests they were staple foods, together with the cere- als and pulses. 44.

"PRE-DOMESTICATION CULTIVATION" AT ZAHRAT ADH-DHRA' 2 Barley, wheat and the pulses were probably cultivated at ZAD 2. The evidence is ambiguous, due to the poor preserva- tion of most of the remains, but it has been argued that mor- phologically wild barley was cultivated45. This may, strictly speaking, be referred to as "non-domestication cultivation" or "pre-domestication cultivation"46 as there is no evidence that the cultivation methods employed at ZAD 2 favoured the evo- lution of the domestic form of barley. At ZAD 2, wild-type barley rachis internodes outnumber the domestic type (32 def- inite and 2 probable wild types, versus 4 definite, 7 probable and 2 dubious domestic types). Most (121) barley rachis inter- nodes could not be assigned to one type or the other, because the abscission scar was not preserved. Most of these, how- ever, are narrow and have sturdy lateral floret bases, charac- teristics of wild barley47. Over 500 fragments of lateral floret bases were also found. After allowing for the poorer preserva- tion of the ZAD 2 remains, these proportions are similar to those obtained at Netiv Hagdud48, where Kislev attributed all the chaff to wild barley. The barley chaff, therefore, is proba- bly all of the wild variety. No intact cereal grains were recovered. Of the 73 cereal grain fragments that could be identified as barley, 40 were complete enough for the thickness and breadth of the grain to be measured. When plotted, these measurements fall into two groups, the dimensions of which correspond to those of wild and domestic barley grains identified at other Neolithic sites in Jordan49. Of the 40 grains, 15 had been identified as wild barley on morphological grounds, 16 had been identified as "domestic" and 9 could not be classified as wild or domestic grains. All 16 "domestic" grains fell into the size group corre- sponding to domestic barley, while 14 of the 15 "wild" grains fell into the "wild" size group ; the indeterminates fell mainly into the lower end of the "domestic" size group. Thus, it appears that one type of chaff is associated with two size groups of grain. The likely explanation is "pre-domestication cultivation", perhaps supplemented by gathering of wild bar- ley from natural stands. The remains of wheat are too few and too poorly preserved for comparable measurements to be 45. Meadows, 2004. 46. Hillman and Davies, 1990 : 168. 47. VAN Zeist and BAKKER-HEERES, 1982 : 204. 48.

The location of ZAD 2 suggests that the wheat was cultivated, as wild emmer is not found in southern Jordan, but its relative scarcity may imply that it was a "weed" of the bar- ley crop, rather than a crop in its own right. Two aspects of the pulses suggest that they were also cul- tivated. Firstly, pulse fragments are roughly as abundant as cereal fragments, and occur in almost as many loci. Secondly, the pulse taxa at ZAD 2 are indistinguishable from those that were later domesticated - lentil, pea ( Pisum sativum ), bitter vetch ( Vicia ervilia) and grass pea. The mutations that charac- terise domestic pulse crops (loss of seed dormancy and pod indehiscence) are not observable in carbonised seeds50. Nev- ertheless, the evidence is inconclusive. Pulse cultivation (and indeed domestication) at ZAD 2 is possible, but unproven. It is assumed that the cereals and pulses were grown close to the site, taking advantage of the availability of flat land and the perennial flow of the Wadi adh-Dhra'. Indeed, the estab- lishment of ZAD 2, two kilometres west of a pre-existing PPNA site at the spring of Dhra'may further reflect the adop- tion of food production, as this new site was further again than the Dhra' site from the natural habitat of the principal food plants. FAUNAL REMAINS AT ZAHRAT ADH-DHRA' 2 In contrast to the botanical remains, faunal remains from ZAD 2 have been very scant51. Metzger has analysed the few first season specimens and identified the large mammals Capra sp. and Bos primigenius, a carnivore, and the freshwa- ter crab ( Potamon sp ). Many of the larger mammalian frag- ments are likely to belong to either Capra or Gazella. THE HUMAN REMAINS (HOMO 1) IN THE FEATURE 5 COMMUNAL BURIAL (ZAD 2) This report concerns the first individual {Homo 1) encoun- tered in the Feature 5 multiple burial. It is limited to a discus- sion of some of the cranial material, as other cranial and post- cranial material is still in the process of being cleaned and reconstructed. Homo 1 was buried on a slight angle, with the 50. KISLEV and BAR-YOSEF, 1988 ; LADIZINSKY, 1989. 5 1 . Metzger in Edwards et al ., 200 1 . Paléorient, vol. 30/2, p. 21-60 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 anterior portion (the face) buried facing down into the ground. The mandible and atlas were articulated with the cranium at the time of burial, indicating that there was at least some level of articulation of the individual when it was buried. The fragile nature of the cranium meant that its removal from the matrix saw it break into numerous fragments. Very little was preserved of the maxio-facial region other than some small fragments of alveolar bone around the remaining teeth. The outline of the mandible, however, could clearly be made out in situ. Before removal the cranium was carefully cleaned and documented so as to identify any significant mor- phological or pathological features. No obvious pathologies were noted in the remains. While in situ , it was noted that the individual had a pro- nounced supraorbital ridge and reasonably well developed mastoid processes. Morphologically these are considered male characters, although it is difficult to provide a definitive statement of sex from skeletal remains in the absence of the innominate bone. In the occipital bone, a reasonably well developed inferior nuchal line and external occipital protuber- ance suggested considerable muscle attachments. The masse- teric tuberosity was, on the other hand, not well developed which suggests that the stresses of mastication were not par- ticularly heavy. Establishing the age of cranial material in such a fragmen- tary state is problematic. The cranial sutures were not obliter- ated suggesting that the individual was not old. It was noted that the different bones of the cranium had come apart at the coronal, sagittal and lambdoidal sutures. Considerable wear on the occlusal surfaces of the teeth was recorded, however, the cusps were not worn flat on all teeth and features such as regular fissures were still apparent in at least one tooth (the left maxillary second premolar). The condition of the sutures and degree of occlusal wear would indicate that the individual was an adult. An unusual pattern of wear was identified in the first left maxillary molar. It consisted of a very severe pattern of wear on the lingual portion of the tooth which climbed steeply to the regular height of the occlusal surface on the buccal side. It may be associated with some kind of task or activity ; how- ever, in the absence of adjacent teeth and the alveolar struc- ture it is difficult to say. In the posterior mandibular dentition there is considerable alveolar resorption, which suggests that the last two molars on each side may have been lost due to some activity-related mechanism. There is no evidence of infection of the alveolar region, and therefore pathology is unlikely to be the cause of</page><page sequence="24">44 P.C. Edwards, J. Meadows, G. Sayej and M. Westaway tooth loss, unless all lesions had healed. The unusual occlusal wear pattern on the left side maxillary Ml most likely has some relationship with this, however, the absence of evidence for the supporting tooth structure makes it difficult to explain this unusual pattern of wear. CULTURAL DIVERGENCES BETWEEN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LEVANT DURING THE LATE PPNA PERIOD If, as we argue here, that important elements of the EPPNB emerged first in north Syria and spread later to the southern Levant, one might expect the late southern Levantine PPNA sequence to lack the innovations that emerged deep within the Syrian PPNA. As the first clear example of a late southern PPNA site, ZAD 2 demonstrates this to be the case, and renders more sharply in focus a discernable cultural diver- gence between north and south that widened in the late PPNA. To begin with, the term "late PPNA" requires some clarifica- tion. We use it to refer to the period dated by radiocarbon between 9 600-9 200 BP. We have employed it deliberately in preference to the terms "Khiamian" and "Sultanian", which were long ago established to designate early and late varieties of PPNA material culture. In the south, the term "PPNA" is currently regaining ground while the Khiamian and Sultanian subdivisions are faltering under increasing attack52. Thus, according to the excavations at Salabiya IX, the Khiamian was distinguished from the overlying Sultanian mainly by dif- fering frequencies of retouched tools : lunates, El Khiam points, and an absence of Beit Ta'amir sickle blades, flaked axes and ground edged axes. The trouble was that the radio- carbon dates for the site did not place it within the proposed Khiamian timeslot ( ca 10 300-10 000 BP)53. Further, Nadel has demonstrated contemporaneously occurring assemblages at Netiv Hagdud which respectively correspond to the defini- tions of Khiamian and Sultanian facies. Granted, the Khia- mian lies stratigraphically beneath the Sultanian at Hatula, but Nadel has interpreted this situation as one of vertically super- imposed deposits of short duration, both contained within a single, broadly contemporaneous period54. 52. FINLAYSON et al., 2003 ; SAYEJ, 2001. 53. ENOCH-SHILOH and BAR-YOSEF, 1997. 54. Lechevallier et RONEN, 1985 ; NADEL, 1998. In south Jordan, Wadi Faynan 16 has now yielded Khia- mian-type assemblages corresponding with late dates, and Sultanian-type assemblages correlated with early dates55. Zahrat adh-Dhra' 2 more or less fits into the definition of the Sultanian, except that is has unusual proportions of tool types : high frequencies of Hagdud Truncations but hardly any projectile points, an abundance of flaked axes and some edge-ground ones, and of borers, some sickle blades, and a substantial groundstone assemblage associated with plant food processing. Overall it supports Nadel's argument that PPNA tool frequencies are conditioned by a number of factors besides time, in this case with functional specialisation. There are many features which unify PPNA sites across the Levant, such as the generalized hunter-gatherer-cultiva- tor(?) subsistence mode, similar forms of notched and tanged projectile points56 and a shared obsidian exchange network57. At another level, régionalisation is evident in the different tool kits, for example in the north : "herminettes" and adzes hafted in antler sleeves ; and in the south, Hagdud truncations, and tranchet axes. Many other genres of northern material culture such as aurochs' horns, polished and engraved marble bowls58, pressure flaking techniques59 and eyed bone nee- dles60 are absent from the south. Of most interest to our argument is the dynamism evident in northern settlement systems during the late PPNA. By contrast, one can discern in the south a kind of stasis. For example, Jeri- cho manifests its most remarkable developments of tower, wall and ditch near the beginning of the PPNA episode. In so far as settlement layout and architectural forms are concerned, it is not thereafter surpassed in scale, complexity nor inventiveness by later southern PPNA sites. Notably, curvilinear architecture remains de rigueur , comprising circular or oval mudbrick or stone huts. In the meantime, northern architectural forms evolve steadily. At Mureybet, circular huts are fitted with recti- linear partition walls in Phase III. At the same time or even ear- lier, Cheikh Hassan sees rectilinear forms in the lower level of the South sondage, before square rooms arranged in rows appear in its upper level61. The most elaborate sequence occurs at Jerf al-Ahmar, which sees curvilinear forms (Phases VII/E to IV/E), modified later with internal rectilinear divisions (Phases 55.

The upper phases (III/E to the "moins I est", -I/E) at Jerf al-Ahmar also witness the development of the archaizing circular "community house"-type with its hexagonal interior and elaborate ritual fittings. A similar development has now been unearthed from Tell al-Abr, also on the Euphrates62. It is also now clear from the sites of Mureybet, Cheikh Hassan and Jerf al-Ahmar that the characteristic PPNB pro- duction of long, parallel blades from opposed platform, navi- form cores began deep within the PPNA63. Opposed platform cores occurred in the south from the earliest Epipalaeolithic, but these were entirely different types. The southern PPNA industries retained an Epipalaeolithic flavour, remaining dominated by single platform blade/let cores and concomitant end-products dominated by bladelets (as shown in the detailed analyses of Netiv Hagdud and ZAD 2), but they never include the naviform core type64. Typologically, El Khiam and Hel- wan points dominate the late PPNA (Mureybetian) phase in north Syria (at Mureybet III, Cheikh Hassan and Jerf al- Ahmar). At Mureybet and Dja'de al-Mughara they are largely gone by 9 600 BP65, the traditional beginning of the north Syrian EPPNB, to be replaced by tanged and invasively retouched forms like the Byblos point. In the south, however, the Helwan point did not feature in the PPNA. With the engraved limestone plaques and pebbles that are infrequently but widely unearthed from PPNA sites, we are also becoming increasingly aware of a distinct north-south régionalisation. In the north, there is the appearance at Jerf al- Ahmar of a series of animal motifs : serpent, fox, and bucrania which find striking later parallels from the EPPNB of south- ern Turkey66. Rich figurative design types are also beginning to emerge from PPNA strata at Qaramel, north of Aleppo67. By contrast, zoomorphic and figurative motifs are never found on incised pieces in the south, whose examples are presently limited to geometric designs. The composition with vertical lines pendant from four horizontal strokes, found at ZAD 2, is similar in general conception to the incised pebble from Netiv Hagdud. One can also mention in this connection, uncertainly dated but securely PPN examples from Jilat 7 in east Jordan and Horvat Galil in Galilee68. 62.

Paléorient, vol. 30/2, p. 21-60 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 MOTZA Just as ZAD 2 has elucidated the end of the PPNA, so recent finds at the site of Motza, have illuminated the beginning of the PPNB in the southern Levant. While it is still early days in the investigation of both sites, they jointly promise to clarify not only the timing but also the nature of the introduction of the PPNA-PPNB transition in the southern Levant. Motza is a large multi-period site, which has been excavated over the past dec- ade through successive phases of Iron Age, Early Bronze I, Pot- tery Neolithic and MPPNB. Underlying the latter phase, Khalaily and colleagues have reached a phase they report as EPPNB, up to 2 m thick and comprising at least three occupa- tional layers. This EPPNB phase is dated by a dozen radiocar- bon dates which span the period 9 350-9 100 BP69. Architectural remains in the EPPNB phase include both large curvilinear and rectilinear structures associated with hearths, exterior courtyards and burials. Plaster was employed to cover the floors, and some of the burials. Preliminary observations also indicate that the human remains may have been treated by plaster before burial, foreshadowing the familiar plaster modelling of skulls in the MPPNB period. Small artefacts include a clay female anthropomorphic figu- rine, beads, and edge-ground axes made from a green stone. The lithic assemblage features classic naviform cores and long blades, with some of the latter deposited in discrete caches. Large numbers of artefacts are struck from obsidian. Retouched projectiles include many Jericho points and Hel- wan points. Motza appears to be the first well-dated and well-stratified southern PPNB site where numerous Helwan points have been found. Together, ZAD 2 and Motza indicate a seamless chronological transition from the PPNA to the PPNB in the southern Levant. Whether the character of Motza's lowest PPNB phase is sufficiently distinctive to set it apart as "EPPNB" awaits further scrutiny. However, the cultural com- ponents of Motza and ZAD 2 are strikingly dissimilar and point to an influx of northern PPNB elements in the south, en masse , around ca 9 350-9 300 BP. This is a question to which we return in our conclusions, but the next issue we must turn to is Tell Aswad. Until recently, this was a pivotal site in the neolithic of the Levant, linking the PPN regions of north and south, and alone providing a sufficient point of origin for the 69.

Sayej and M. westaway southern EPPNB and a rationale for dating it to ca 9 600 BP. Now, new excavations conducted by the Institut de Préhis- toire at Jalès have changed all that. NEW INVESTIGATIONS AT TELL ASWAD : IMPLICATIONS FOR DATING THE EARLY NEOLITHIC OF THE SOUTHERN LEVANT Located in the Damascene Basin of southern Syria, a region otherwise devoid of PPNA-EPPNB sites, Tell Aswad played a pivotal role in linking the rich Pre-Pottery Neolithic regions of north Syria and the southern Levant. Following the original excavations of Contenson at Aswad70, Phase 1A (with dates of 9 790 ± 120 BP and 9 690 ± 120 BP) consti- tuted the only regional example of the PPNA (labelled "Aswadian"), and Phase IB, (with dates of 9 390 ± 120 BP and 9 320 ±120 BP) became the regional type site for the EPPNB, although it should be added that the dates for this phase did not clearly support an EPPNB beginning at 9 600 BP. The Aswadian (Phase 1 A) was notable for having yielded a range of early domesticated plants, including emmer and flax, alleged "circular houses" and Helwan points71. The EPPNB layers (Phase IB) also yielded Helwan points. Renewed excavations at Tell Aswad undertaken by Stor- deur and colleagues72 have delivered surprisingly variant results to the original excavations of Contenson and his team73, undermining Aswad as a bulwark of the southern EPPNB in the process. The new excavations were placed as close as possible to the old ones and in the same relative strati- graphic position. Thus, Contenson' s Niveau 1 A (between alti- tudes - 2.25 m and virgin soil at - 4.45 m) correlates to the new "niveaux anciens" in Sector В (between -2.25 and -4.5 m) ; Contenson' s Phase IB (between - 1.75 and 2.25 m) equates with the new "niveaux intermédiaires" in Sector В (between - 1.75 and 2.25 m) ; and Contenson's east sondage Niveau II (between the surface and - 1 .75 m) equates with the new "niveaux récents" in Sector В (which are also between the surface and - 1.75 m), as well as deposits from Sector C. Samples from the oldest layers of the site (the "niveaux anciens" in Sector B) produced dates of 9 219 ± 68 BP (Ly 70. CONTENSON, 1979. 71. Cauvin, 1995 ; GOPHER, 1990 : 141 ; VAN ZEIST and BAKKER- HEERES, 1982. 72. STORDEUR, 2003. 73. CONTENSON, 1995. 11384), 9 285 ± 51 BP (Ly 11383) and 9 805 ± 115 BP (Ly 1 1385). The first two are too recent for a PPNA placement. The third one is anomalous with respect to these, but is rejected by the excavators because of the large confidence interval (764 years) of the calibrated date (9 602-8 838 ВС). Furthermore, the architecture, material culture, and subsist- ence economy retrieved from the "niveaux anciens" are also at odds with a PPNA designation - or even an EPPNB one. Architecture includes a 6-m long section of straight wall, coated with plaster which bore traces of pigment. An adult human cranium was found, placed on a bench associated with plaster. Lithics include the Aswad points (= Helwan points) that Contenson found, but these are accompanied by Jericho, Byblos and oval (= Amuq) points. The finding of morphologically domesticated emmer74 in Phase 1A, from the original investigations at Aswad, accorded with contemporaneous expectations for the PPNA. Since then however, revisions to archaeobotanical interpreta- tions have left this find increasingly isolated75. The new exca- vations have verified the existence of domesticated emmer from the basal layers of the site, accompanied by flax seeds, impressions of linen fabrics, and a range of gathered plant resources. The archaeobotanical assemblage from the "niveaux anciens", analysed by Willcox sits much better in a PPNB context. Likewise, the presence of morphologically domesticated sheep and goat in the "niveaux anciens" are more at home in the PPNB, since they are otherwise unknown in the PPNA76. In the overlying "niveaux intermédiaires", these species are joined by domesticated pig and cattle. At first sight it seems extraordinary that such an important and well-known site like Tell Aswad could be subject to such drastic revisions. On closer examination, however, the dis- crepancy becomes more comprehensible. The original exca- vations of Phase 1A (levels 1-8) were located in the "Aswad Est" sondage. While hearths were encountered here, neither houses nor built structures were in the relatively small exca- vation area of 4 m x 4 m77. Thus, the phase was not readily distinguishable on the basis of its architectural characteristics. Curiously, the radiocarbon dates published earlier were not described in their stratigraphie context, and in fact are not mentioned at all in the final report. 74.

Cauvin) was restricted to the retouched component, pre- cluding insights to be gained from a technological study of cores and debitage. Cauvin78 had stressed the distinctiveness of the As wad Phase 1A and IB tanged and notched projectile points. Specifically, some of the Aswad projectiles are fash- ioned on long-bladed blanks which bear two pairs of opposed notches, with one pair positioned well to the distal end of the blade. Gopher's comprehensive analysis of Helwan points also highlighted their distinctiveness. Tanged Helwan points with two pairs of opposed notches do occur in the south, for example at Horvat Galil, but they are made on shorter blanks79. In sum- mary, the new investigations at Tell Aswad indicate that the site begins in the MPPNB period, ca 9 200 BP and thus cancel it as a reference point for the southern Levantine EPPNB. CLARIFYING THE ORIGIN OF THE NORTH SYRIAN EPPNB The proposal that the EPPNB began at 9 600 BP in the southern Levant rested ultimately on Jacques Cauvin's assess- ment of Phase IV at Mureybet in north Syria. Cauvin's 9 600 BP date was the earliest produced anywhere in the Levant for the EPPNB. Therefore, the southern EPPNB could not be placed earlier than that. Yet even the claimed contemporane- ity still left room for the southern Levantine EPPNB to have developed as an indigenous phenomenon. As we have argued here, there is now overwhelming evidence that the majority of developments termed "PPNB" arose in north Syria. Work has continued apace on the PPNB, in the north as in the south, so it worth at this juncture to review the dating evidence for the emergence of the PPNB entity in Syria. At Mureybet, the lowermost two determinations from the earliest of the EPPNB phases (I Va) are dated to 9 000-9 100 BP. Only the uppermost determination dated to 9 600 BP, and thus it was anomalous with respect to the lower ones. Cau- vin80 recognised the contradiction, but opted finally for a 9 600-9 100 BP placement for Phase I Va, for two main rea- sons. Firstly, IVa showed stratigraphie conformity and cul- tural continuity with the underlying Phase III b which yielded several dates indicating a terminal age of 9 600-9 500 BP ; 78. CAUVIN, 1995 : 95. 79. Gopher, 1994 : 34-36 ; GOPHER, 1997 : figs 14:4, 15:7. 80. CAUVIN, 1989 : 47. Paléorient, vol. 30/2, p. 21-60 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 and secondly, the overlying Phase IVb dated within the 9 300- 8 900 BP timespan. More recently, the extensive Jerf al-Ahmar sequence has thrown positive light on the transition to the PPNB in Syria. Level II West dates to 9 445 ± 75 BP, and the "moins I Est" (- IE) level, attributed to a PPNA-PPNB transitional phase, is dated to 9 395 ± 55 BP81. Stordeur and Abbès place the emer- gence of the Syrian EPPNB around 9 500 BP in their sum- mary chronological chart. Since the excavation of Mureybet, Dja'de al-Mughara located further upstream on the Euphrates, has been the only other Euphratian site to yield a major EPPNB sequence. Dja'de is distinguished by "grill-plan" buildings and a mass burial in the "Maison des Morts"82. The first series of pub- lished dates from Dja'de spanned the period 9 600-9 000 BP. Again, the excavator questioned those ranging between 9 600-9 200 BP, since they were run on very small carbon samples, leaving a more reliable trio of dates between 9 200- 9 000 BP. Coqueugniot has since obtained additional dates for Dja'de. The earliest two date Phase I-II to ca 9 600-9 500 BP, appearing to confirm the thesis that the Syrian EPPNB emerged around 9 600 BP83. REVIEWING EVIDENCE FOR THE EPPNB IN THE SOUTHERN LEVANT Gopher84 has perhaps expended most research effort in the search for an early southern EPPNB, whereas Kuijt85 has criticised the reliability of the sites proposed for it, objecting that they are either undated or lacking in convincing evi- dence. The new evidence thrown up by ZAD 2 and Motza now allows us to review previously published claims for a southern EPPNB from a more secure basis. We examine the key sites below. 81.

Westaway MUJAHIYA Mujahiya on the Golan Heights (fig. 1) has not produced radiocarbon dates, but was proposed by Gopher86 as EPPNB because of a preponderance of Helwan points among the flint projectiles. Its assemblage is a conflation of two distinct ones derived from superimposed strata, combined with a collection of unstratified surface items. Gopher87 describes Mujahiya as encompassing "at least two Pre-Pottery Neolithic layers". The earlier, Stratum C, is separated from the overlying Stratum В by a 10 cm-thick layer of river pebbles, which may represent a significant inter- lude of time between the two. The site's various architectural features are not attributed to either stratigraphie context, although it is evident from the stratigraphie section88 that both Stratum С and the overlying Stratum В contain distinct sets of architectural remains. Those in Stratum С are not mentioned in the text, but those in Stratum В are presumably the Area A features, described in figure 5 as curvilinear architecture. The remains contain a curvilinear wall section, probably a house wall, but they also include a possibly straight wall segment ; so this feature remains equivocal. Leaving aside the surface collection in the local museum, the excavated Helwan points number only five, accompanied by a single specimen each of el-Khiam, Jericho and Byblos points, and although Gopher concedes that the small sample cannot support "a meaningful quantitative discussion"89 in terms of a proportional seriation curve, he nevertheless con- cludes that the projectile sample fits expectations for the EPPNB. Gopher90 describes clear PPNA affinities from Muja- hiya, such as a Hagdud truncation, and stone cuphole mortars. The illustrated cores, mostly single platform bladelet types, would also fit well in a southern Levantine PPNA context. While noting that the site exhibits both PPNA and PPNB affinities, Gopher concludes by placing the site in the EPPNB, apparently by assuming a chronological average for its vari- ous components91. There exists the alternative possibility that Mujahiya could contain a PPNA assemblage overlain by an MPPNB assemblage. However, a definitive judgement about this cannot be made until the thousands of artefacts of all kinds, and not just the few projectile points, are presented sep- 86. Gopher, 1990. 87.

HORVAT GALIL Horvat Galil is located in western Galilee. The site's pre- historic remains, which were extensively damaged by later construction in the Byzantine period, derive from several peri- ods and are described as having possible PPNA layers, a "main PPNB layer", a "later PPNB" layer, a Pottery Neolithic layer, as well as scattered Helwan points from an excavated surface not considered as in situ occurrences. A stratigraphie section is presented, and there are two radiocarbon dates of 7 390 ± 70 ВС (RT-1397 ; i.e. 9 340 ± 70 BP) and 7 000 ± 100 ВС (RT-1396 ; i.e. 8 950 ± 100 BP) for the site. The "main PPNB layer" contains the remnants of a rectangular mudbrick building with plastered floors (including burnt lime plaster)92. While lithic samples are tabled by individual context, these excavation loci are not identified on the stratigraphie section nor allocated to any of the major phases. The lithic assemblage, which Gopher designates as EPPNB, is derived from the various excavated phases, conflated with a large sur- face collection. The retouched tools include el-Khiam, Hel- wan, Jericho, Byblos and Amuq point types. Of the 48 points from the excavations, Helwan points are clearly predominant at 60 %, with Jericho and Byblos types making up 33 %. According to Gopher these proportions argue for an EPPNB placement, but it is difficult to accept this assertion without knowing the relative stratigraphie position of each excavated component in the site sequence. Interestingly, like Motza, Horvat Galil yielded numerous obsidian artefacts and kiln- fired plaster components on the floors. The architectural types and the earlier radiocarbon date from Horvat Galil are intrigu- ing, and might well correlate to the EPPNB phase at Motza. Unfortunately the dates' significance remains obscure while it is unclear to which occupational phase(s) they belong and with which assemblages they are correlated93.

Almost half of the identified projectile points from Layer I are classified as Helwan points. Other types such as El Khiam, Jericho and Byblos points are also available95. The nature of this site is open to doubt for a number of reasons. No radiocarbon dates are available, and it is located on a slope and the possibilities of admixtures from different occupations are high. The Helwan points, accompa- nied by many other types of projectile points such as El Khiam, Jericho and Byblos types might result from admix- tures between the various layers of occupation - or all of the above point types might even belong to the MPPNB. SEFUNIM CAVE Sefunim is a cave site in Mount Carmel and has multiple occupation periods. The excavators labelled Layer 7 of the cave as the Neolithic component96. Nearby to Sefunim cave, two other Neolithic sites were identified : the first in the ter- race in front of the cave (layers III, IV, and V) and the second in the nearby rock-shelter of Modi Lamdan97. The nature of the Layer 7 lithic assemblage is not entirely clear, due to the fact that Ronen divided it into a typical "Neo- lithic component" and "non-Neolithic component", the latter including tool types such as Mousterian pieces. Of the 641 retouched tools recovered from Layer 7, Ronen classes only 65 as "typical Neolithic" and these are : three projectile points (two Jericho and one Amuq), five sickle blades and 57 bifacial tools. Ronen also notes in Layer III of the terrace an extra three projectile points (two Jericho and one Helwan), as well as three points in layer IV (Byblos, Jericho and Helwan) and another three points from the Modi Lamdan rock shelter which are not further specified98. Neither Ronen nor any of his other colleagues mention that Sefunim or the nearby sites are EPPNB. Gopher on the other hand, states : "The arrowhead assemblage from this Carmel site may serve as an important clue for understanding the introductory stages of the Helwan point to the Southern Levant since this type is the most important in the assemblage"99. 94.

Paléorient, vol. 30/2, p. 21-60 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 Ronen mentions only two Helwan points out of a total of 12 listed, so it is unclear how the Sefunim assemblages sup- port a chronological clarification of the introduction of the Helwan point, when the three radiocarbon dates from Layer V of the Sefunim terrace, 9 395 ± 130 BP (Hv 3368), 9 120 ± 85 BP (KN-I 366) and 7 730 ± 115 BP (Hv 2597)100, cover a broad time span, extending well beyond the proposed time- span of the EPPNB. ABU SALEM This site is located in the Har Harif plateau in the Negev. In 1981-1982 Gopher and Goring-Morris re-examined the site, which had earlier been excavated by Marks and Scott. Their excavations revealed a series of rounded structures above the Harifian layers. According to the excavators, these were EPPNB101. While classifying the lithics, Gopher and Goring-Morris noticed that some Harifian tool types were mixed with PPNB tool types. Separating the lithics of these two periods was done according to differences in raw materials and techno- typology, but not by stratigraphy. The excavators suggest that the Harifian assemblage is characterized by a clear preference for translucent chalcedony for the production of all tool cate- gories as well as a high proportion of microliths102. In con- trast, the PPNB industry is characterized by the usage of brown to light grey and beige flint. Within the PPNB industry, many opposed platform cores, some tending towards navi- form types, were noticed as well as almost an equal amount of flakes and blades in the debitage category103. Based on the existence of 2 1 .2 % of Helwan points, a com- ponent of Abu Salem was identified by Gopher and Goring- Morris as EPPNB. Further types such as Jericho points, which form 45.2 % of the projectile points and Byblos points, which form 29.7 %, were not considered in their interpretations104. Both Jericho and Byblos types were used through the MPPNB period across the Levant. Why the site has to be counted as EPPNB and not as MPPNB is not clear. Gopher and Goring- Morris state that : 100.

WESTAWAY "although the chipped stone tool assemblage recovered is mixed with intrusive Harifian artefacts, the use of commonly quite different sources of flint enabled separation into their respective components with a high degree of reliability"105. The reliability of this system is a matter of speculation while there are no radiocarbon dates or stratigraphie divisions to support the claim. NAHAL LAVAN 109 The site of Nahal Lavan 109 was discovered in 1973 by Friedmann and Burian and is located in the Negev between Wadi Lavan and Wadi Ruth. The assemblage was collected from a single eroded layer on the top of a loess slope and from a small sondage. The vast majority of artefacts were manufac- tured on flint and sixty pieces of obsidian were also recovered. The retouched tools of this assemblage include as many as 727 projectile points, though Gopher reports that 1 000 pro- jectile points were gathered from the surface as well as from the limited excavation of the site, with 80 % classified as Hel- wan, augmented by some Jericho and Byblos points106. Thus, Nahal Lavan 109 is one of the few sites to have yielded a large sample of projectile points where Helwan points are also in a clear majority. Nevertheless, this site does not supply infor- mation in regard to stratigraphy and lacks radiocarbon dates which could support the existence of an EPPNB phase. WADI JILAT 7 Along with Horvat Galil, Wadi Jilat 7 in east Jordan107 provides intriguing evidence for the EPPNB ; though at present we do not believe the case to be conclusive. The Jilat 7 excavations unearthed curvilinear huts constructed from upright stone slabs. A hut structure in Area В and its associ- ated material culture are identified as MPPNB, yielding dates of 8 810 ± 110 BP(OxA-526) for the "early occupational fill" and 8 520 ±110 BP(OxA-527) for the "middle occupational fill"108. Similar curvilinear huts in Area A and С are named as EPPNB on the basis of associated finds, though it is to be noted that the architecture is in all regards similar to the MPPNB types from Area В (curvilinear architecture widely persisted through the PPNB in the peripheral arid regions of 105. Gopher and Goring-Morris, 1998 : 16. 106. BURIAN et al., 1976 : 53, 55 ; GOPHER, 1989b : 97. 107. Garrard et al., 1994a, b. 108.

Two dates from the declared EPPNB deposits of Areas A and С are 8 390 ± 80 BP(OxA- 2413) and 5 840 ± 100 BP(OxA-1799). At issue is the character of the lithic industry recovered from the "early phase deposits" of Areas A and С (also called Wadi Jilat 7 Chipped Stone Phase I). A wide range of projec- tile types that occur in the PPNA and PPNB are present (Sal- ibiya, Jordan Valley, Khiam, Helwan, Jericho and Byblos), but Helwan points hold the ascendancy at 67 % (30/45 projec- tile specimens), just as Gopher has argued they should for the EPPNB. They are accompanied by 22 % El Khiam points (10/ 45 specimens), and also by Hagdud truncations and naviform cores. Helwan points decrease in Jilat Chipped Stone Phases II and III, suggested by Baird to be possibly MPPNB and LPPNB in date respectively109, just as Gopher also says they should. Even though Byblos points become predominant in both latter phases, Helwan points also maintain a strong showing in these relatively small samples : at 39 % (9/23) and 44 % (14/32) respectively, a circumstance which lessens their effectiveness as chronological seriators. Like Motza, Jilat 7 also yielded numerous obsidian artefacts, whereas southern PPNA sites only ever yield small quantities of the material. There are several ways to view the Jilat 7 evidence. As the excavators note, one explanation is that root fissures have transported later charcoal fragments down into genuine EPPNB layers. The excavators, however, also allude to a number of robbing and remodelling activities in the Jilat 7 dwellings carried out in antiquity110. These might have acted to combine PPNA and MPPNB components of the site, which in turn might explain the occurrence of PPNA typology (El- Khiam points and Hagdud truncations) with PPNB technol- ogy (naviform cores). Finally, we know of cases of cultural lag in the Levantine corridor, for example, the earlier occur- rence of the Helwan point in the north than in the south. Such types may have also diffused later into east Jordan from the southern Levantine corridor, just as animal herding did1 1 1. The main problem, as we see it, is that all of the radiocar- bon dates associated with the assemblages designated as EPPNB are far too late to fit within the putative southern EPPNB period. Unfortunately, Jilat 7 has now been destroyed, though the dating of further radiocarbon samples from this site may yet spring surprises. 109. Ibid. : 86. 110.

These include Nahal Michmoret 26/26a located in Israel, and Abu Hudhud in Jordan112. As such, these sites cannot not bring additional lines of evidence to bear on the issue, but merely provide additional undated occurrences requiring to be fitted into a chronological scheme, through reference to dated and excavated sites. Future studies from the excavators of Motza will undoubt- edly clarify he frequency of the Helwan point at Motza vis-à- vis the later PPNB sites in the southern Levant. While the Hel- wan point is absent from southern PPNA sites, it does con- tinue into MPPNB assemblages, so the key issue is the strength of the association of the type with EPPNB assem- blages relative to MPPB ones. WHAT CAME SOUTH ? MATERIAL CULTURE AND PEOPLE IN THE PPNB Having proposed that PPNB elements diffused from north to the south, it remains incumbent upon us to clarify what actually arrived : was it a coherent "PPNB exodus" of the sort conjectured by Jacques Cauvin113, or perhaps a diffusion of goods and ideas, carried over communication routes along with the occasional batch of obsidian ? We do indeed argue for the involvement of émigrés - real people - so we need at the outset to briefly articulate our posi- tion on material culture and its meaning. Firstly we should emphasize that we concur with the consensus that denies a straightforward correspondence between archaeologically constructed cultures and human societies, a point which requires some elaboration here. In the 1920s, Childe formalized a conception of the archaeological culture as comprising an array of material traits distributed within a spatially discrete and contiguous region, and a limited time period. Utilizing the culture-history paradigm, Childe arranged the archaeological remains of neo- lithic Europe into cultural provinces, which he conceived of 1 12. GOPHER, 1996 ; ROLLEFSON, 1996. 113. Cauvin, 2000. Paléorient, vol. 30/2, p. 21-60 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 (at least originally) as so many distinct peoples. Subsequently, they became established under familiar names such as Kara- novo, Vinça, and so on. This scheme seemed a powerful tool for discovering the people behind the pots, and has continued to be espoused from Childe' s time to this1 14. The problem remained that the efficacy of the culture-his- tory paradigm had never been systematically demonstrated. Childe did not take up the concept after an exhaustive analysis of archaeological character traits. Rather, he inherited the idea from Kossinna ; and Kossinna developed it not due to a disin- terested scholarly interest in the building of archaeological theory, but out of his curiosity about the origins of the German people. In order to attach a prehistory to the Germanic tribes described by Tacitus, he needed to find a material correlate of the Teutonic people on the ground. The erroneous link he made was with the neolithic Linearbandkeramik , with terrible consequences famously ensuing115. While the culture-history paradigm reigned supreme through the early twentieth century, a minority of some schol- ars had always expressed skepticism about it. Already in the nineteenth century Müller, who had discerned the ancestral Indo-European language among words embedded in its daugh- ter languages, had warned of the dangers of conceiving of Indo-European as a people, a nation, or a cultural region of the Orient116. From the same period, the Middle East itself sup- plied perhaps the strongest challenge to the equivalence of material culture, language and ethnicity ; and one which has never been successfully met. For some time after Rawlinson's decipherment of ancient Semitic languages in the mid-nine- teenth century, the existence of the earlier Sumerian language was not appreciated. A key reason for this was that the earliest Semitic language, Akkadian, had borrowed the material form of the Sumerian cuneiform writing system for its very expres- sion, (even though both belonged to entirely different language groups)117. The exploits of the Akkadian dynasty, its kings, and its empire, in short one of the most important of the early archaic states, became known through its written texts. Over 150 years later, its material basis still cannot be satisfactorily isolated among the complex of Mesopotamian archaeological cultures. Recent analyses of identity and material culture in the historical Middle East continue to underscore their mismatch. Graf, for example, has demonstrated that the "Nabataean" identity accorded to the celebrated builders of Petra in Jordan 114. Childe, 1929 ; Goring-Morris, 1987 : 3. 115.

Westaway is better understood as a matter of political ideology than as a simple ethnic, religious or linguistic attribution118. Throughout the period of culture-history's ascendancy, suspicion lingered that it would only be a matter of time until enough careful, quantitative archaeology was done to fully define the material cultures of particular societies. This, how- ever, wasn't the key problem. Peoples and pots just didn't behave as Kossinna and Childe had envisioned. By the 1950s, anthropologists such as Francis and Leach had deconstructed living cultures, and shown that social boundaries did not cor- respond to cultural borders119. In the late 1970s Hodder summed up decades of mired progress on culture, concluding that human societies do not correspond to unitary material-culture entities120. Naturally, societies produce consistent material culture products, but the point is that these entities spill over social borders, to be taken up and shared by other societies. The corollary of this process is that a society may also receive and incorporate a patchwork of cultural traits from neighbouring groups. Hodder explained the illusion of a coherent material-culture horizon as a contin- gent effect of the observer's viewpoint, surveying an archaeo- logical horizon within a limited geographical region ; always discovering a mosaic of cultural traits which may appear, at the sweep of the eye, to represent a coherent unit, but which neces- sarily fade from view towards its spatial and temporal horizons. As David Clarke showed121, material culture is polythetic in both spatial and temporal dimensions, with various ele- ments of a culture appearing and disappearing at different rates. This is how we should view the PPNB : as a complex of traits which appeared polythetically, at different times and from various sources. Firstly, naviform core and blade tech- nology appeared, deep within the Syrian PPNA. In the late PPNA it became located within the context of rectilinear architectural forms. By the EPPNB tanged, invasively-flaked projectile points were added to the mix. From northern Iraq came polished marble vessels, and possibly kiln-fired plaster. The process of trait innovation and transfer never stops, and that of trait disappearance and transformation never finishes. The PPNB, like all archaeological cultures, is always "coming into being". But from our vantage point of elapsed time, there is a horizon on which it appears to have stabilized as a unitary entity. The familiar PPNB is definable in Syria by approxi- 118. Liverani, 1993 : 7-8 ; MATTHEWS, 2003 : 152 ; see also GRAF, 2004. 1 19. FRANCIS, 1947 ; LEACH, 1954. 120. HODDER, 1978. 121. Clarke, 1978. mately 9 500 BP ; the trait complex being by then utilised by an indeterminate complex of ethnic groups and societies. In contrast to the situation in Syria, the PPNB appears sud- denly at Motza in the southern Levant as a package of PPNB traits such as rectilinear architecture ; plastered floors, navi- form cores and long blades, Helwan points, and dramatically increased imports of Turkish obsidian. The simultaneous appearance of so many traits that were pre-existent in the north, and the prospect that new social networks were respon- sible for the new patterns of obsidian importation, provide the most compelling reasons why we should consider the PPNB in the south to have been instituted, or at least heavily influ- enced, by émigré peoples from the north. THE CREATION OF "DIASPORIC IDENTITY" : IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SPREAD OF THE PPNB When the PPNB appears first in the south at Motza, it immediately differs with respect to its antecedent forms in the north. In particular, it features a series of Helwan points, many made on short blade or flake blanks ; yet the Helwan point had long disappeared from Syria, by the end of the PPNA (ca 9 600 BP). Novel cultural developments also occur which may not owe an origin to Syria, such as mortuary rituals involving treat- ment with plaster. Rather than occurring just as a straightfor- ward assimilation of southern culture elements by northern ones, or an even mixing of both, we witness here the rapid reformulation of antecedent cultural elements and the genesis of novel ones, emerging in the context of a cultural encounter. In this case we argue that it arises from an émigré society newly settled among indigenes. Such creativity may also be initiated in societies settling uninhabited regions. The crystallization of novel forms from cultural encounters is a field that has attracted a revivified interest in recent years after decades of relative qui- escence, following the formulation of the "acculturation" con- cept by Redfield and colleagues in 1936, as "those phenomena which result when groups of individuals having different cul- tures come into continuous first-hand contact, with subsequent changes in the original cultural patterns of either or both groups"122. More recently, the phenomenon has been variously described as "transculturation", "ethnogenesis", "creative 122. Redfield et al., 1936: 149.

While interest in this genre has resided mainly in the dis- ciplines of cultural studies and anthropology, it takes only a moment's reflection for one to recall the ubiquity of culturo- genesis in our own common experience : the emergence of Chicago "blues" music, and "flamenco" music in Moorish Spain, for example, or the vibrant emigré communities of Ital- ian origin in New York, of Greek origin in Melbourne, or of Chinese origin in San Francisco. But what we require to oper- ationalize the phenomenon in prehistoric archaeology are concrete manifestations, that is to say, evidence of transcul- tural artifacts. Even at the outset, Redfield and colleagues expressed a diffident hope that "prehistoric contacts" of this type might be recoverable124. Most case studies have explored historically known situa- tions, and of course we rely on such exemplars to build our experience of the ways in which culturogenesis occurs. Inevitably then, these exemplars arise from a range of modern state-level societies and their colonial impositions on non-industrialized indigenes, and so they may be far from the reality of prehistoric farming villagers. Nonetheless, the phe- nomenon is beginning to be adduced in the ancient world from archaeological examples. For example, Papadopoulos has shown how Archaic period Greek colonists in South Italy adopted Bronze Age symbols to portray themselves as succes- sors to Homer's heroic Bronze Age Achaians, by manufactur- ing archaizing pottery of Bronze Age appearance, and adopting symbols of the "heroic age" on their coins. Coinage itself was an innovation of the Greek colonies, not of their "mother-cities" and was designed, as Papadopoulos argues, to foster a sense of cultural superiority and to maintain a level of dominance by the Greeks over the less economically devel- oped natives with whom they dealt125. We also know from the writings of the Vth century ВС Athenian historian Pherecydes that Greek colonists in South Italy branded some native Italians as "Arcadians", because they reminded them, perhaps, of the simple rural peoples who lived in the interior of Arcadia in the Greek Peloponnese126. Hedeager, and also Dietler, have developed studies on cul- 123.

Prehistoric archaeologists have explained the spread of the Lapita cultural complex into Near and Remote Oceania using models of cultural transformation. The Lapita "peoples" were the first colonists of the uninhab- ited islands of the Pacific, spreading rapidly after 3 000 years ago ; and yet their origins in Melanesia and south East Asia are obscure, with few antecedent parallels to the distinctive Lapita pottery evident128. Here we employ the term "diasporic identity", used by Palumbo-Liu for the process in relation to Chinese communi- ties in America129, to signify the characteristics of émigré or founder societies that are reformulated by the challenges of emigration. When émigré communities settle among indige- nous majorities, historically known situations have highlighted two dynamic social processes that can emerge in such contexts. The first results from the circumscription of the newcom- ers' behaviour by the incumbents, with controls imposed by the indigenous majority due to apprehension aroused by the unfamiliarity or "otherness" of the migrant enclave. The lev- els of sustained stress thereby induced may provoke novel social alliances among members of the migrant faction, which produce new behaviours, and new fashions in the signaling of corporate identity, as a means to maintain morale and solidar- ity. For example, legislation was enacted in the United States during the late 19th century to control and marginalize the immigrant Chinese community in California. Whereas Chi- nese communities would traditionally coalesce around the poles of family, family name, or region of origin for mutual protection in times of stress, this was not a viable option for many Chinese Americans hailing from diverse regions of China. Social aggression stimulated the formation of benefi- cent societies for protection and mutual support, the most important being the tong , which rapidly moved into areas of illicit business to procure wealth and power130. Lydon dis- cusses a similar situation among the early Chinese community in Sydney, which made recourse to the tradition of guanxi to help bring isolated émigrés into networks of "mutual depend- ence" and "obligation and indebtedness"131. For Lydon, the pressures of such contexts of cultural circumscription provide the engine for the creation of newly self-conscious and shared identity among émigré communities, and the creation of 127.

Sayej and M. Westaway "pidgin" cultures. Secondly, an equally important process is the tendency of majority indigenes to assuage their cultural anxiety about immigrant communities by studying, docu- menting and essentalising them, in order to locate them in a comprehensible place on the genealogical map of peoples. Such pigeon-holings often take the form of crude stereotypes and are arrived at through convenient misunderstandings. Nevertheless, they are pressures which require a response from the harried émigré community. Novel cultural forms may also emerge at the individual and household levels, not necessarily as a self-conscious, community-wide resolve or resistance, but as numerous private, impromptu solutions, "maintained at the small sale by shifts in social practices through which new ways of being are forged"132. Such hypothetical considerations inevitably beg for ground- ing in praxis and we provide the following example in this spirit ; not because we think that Chinese gold miners had anything to do with neolithic farmers, but in order to provide a striking illus- tration of the process. This case concerns the origin of "chop suey", the renowned mixed dish figured as quintessentially "Chi- nese" by European Americans, but in reality a product of cultural encounter133. A tradition relates that the dish was born when a drunken band of miners in search of a late meal accosted a San Franciscan restaurateur upon closing time. No longer having ingredients at the ready but wishing to avoid trouble, the propri- etor improvised with his bin of table scraps in order to quickly produce a makeshift meal. The clients were delighted with the result. Word spread rapidly among the white community about the tasty new Chinese meal that had been discovered in the heart of Chinatown ; and Chinese restaurants modified their menus accordingly to cope with the new influx of business134. Thomas has explored the productivity of cultural entanglement in detail, for several types of novel transcultural artefacts in the Pacific emanating from both sides of the colonial fence. These range from the shell-inlaid guns of the Solomon Islands, to George Stubbs' remarkable early visualization of a kangaroo. No marsu- pial with such "rat-like features" as Stubbs painted ever bounded through the Australian bush, itself presented in his painting as a strange, crimped version of a eucalypt forest135. 132. LYONS and Papadopoulos, 2002 : 1. 133. "Chinese food is often perceived as representative of Chinese cul- ture, or an authentic cultural marker. Authenticity of Chinese cuisine, whether at home or overseas, is not an objective criterion, however ; it is socially con- structed and linked to expectation" ; Wu and CHEUNG, 2002 : 7. 134. CHANG, 2003 : 48. 135. THOMAS, 1991 : 105. Born of misreading and counter-manoeuvre, such are the ways that new cultural products materialize, in the grappling space between native and newcomer. Once invented, they may quickly become sanctioned and accepted as community- wide norms. In the case of Motza and the southern Levant, "pidgin" culture may also have been a product of the chemis- try of contact. Traits evidently spread from émigré to host, and vice versa. Among the latter, Jericho points emerged from the south, continuing from the PPNA into the PPNB, and the practice of skull removal and modification continued and developed along an idiosyncratic path, distinct from the treat- ments of the northern Levant. The whole process of the PPNA-PPNB transition was evidently a most complex one. These considerations are intended to provide a frame of reference in which to consider émigré archaeological cultures in the neolithic Levant. On Cyprus, where the earliest neo- lithic arrivals settled, apparently in terra nullius , the earliest settlers maintained offshoots of their Levantine heritage such as naviform core and blade technology, and perhaps the painted motif of human figure with upraised arms at Kalavas- sos-Tenta in Cyprus136, recalling the earlier, rupestral motif at Jerf al-Ahmar137. Simultaneously though, the earliest Cypriot neolithic sites look immediately different from their Levan- tine antecedents in many ways. According to this model of diasporic identity, we will need separate taxonomical labels for the dispersed PPNB cultures ; such as the "Cypro-EPPNB" term already in use138, and "southern EPPNB" for the southern Levant, since the émigré cultures represent new, reconstituted ones ; fundamentally transformed ones with respect to their immediate antecedents. Of course we do not have the mirror of independent textual evidence in prehistory to reflect the specific historical narra- tives of particular societies, so we should not be in the busi- ness of composing specific accounts about émigré cultures139. To do so goes beyond the reasonable limits of inference, and merely adds to our forlorn fund of "just-so" stories, a genre of pseudo-accounts which David Clarke termed "counterfeit his- tory"140. Nevertheless, we may have success in distinguishing the archaeological signature of émigré society, by recognizing the phenomenon of reformulations of antecedent cultural ele- ments, which appear rapidly in the context of diffused archae- ological cultures. In the future, such hypotheses may be 136. TODD, 1981. 137. STORDEUR et ABBÈS, 2002 : 587. 138. Peltenburg et al., 2001 : 51. 139. For example, as developed in RONEN, 2000. 140. CLARKE, 1978 : 1.
