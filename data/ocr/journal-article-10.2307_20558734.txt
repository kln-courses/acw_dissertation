<plain_text><page sequence="1">Discovering Knowth At last I was convinced that the entrance had been found: we set out on our hands and knees to investigate. It proved to be a thrilling, if rather worrying, experience. About 10m from the entrance we had to crawl under an orthostat that had partly fallen inward. Next it was necessary to wriggle through a pool of muddy water on the floor beneath a couple of leaning orthostats. Loose stones on the floor made our crawling rather uncomfortable, and it grew difficult to judge how far we had come, yet there was no sign of an end to the passage. Eventually the roof began to rise in height and we could almost stand upright. Nearly all the orthostats appeared to be decorated, and the whole structure was much more impressive. At one point a stone basin lay in the passage. Then, coming to a sill, we illuminated the orthostat on its inner right side and beheld what seemed to be an anthropomorphic figure with two large, staring eyes. This ghostly guardian suggested that we were approaching the inner sanctum. But we still had several, metres to go, now walking erect and easily except for some boulders on the floor. The end of the passage was finally reached: an undifferentiated chamber with two sillstones. The outer sill and the rear stone of the chamber were decorated, apart from the vertical line, in a manner similar to that of the kerbstone before the entrance?with concentric rectangles. We remained speechless for some time and marvelled at the achievement of these anonymous passage-tomb-builders. Here was truly one of their great enterprises of close to 5000 years ago ...
