As an ovum, it encloses Eleanor who is both seed and egg; the amniotic substance waiting to be reborn and the Magna Genetrix, the great mother of life itself. Over and over again Callahan sees Eleanor in the context of creation: she has become for him the elemental condition of existence; rather than the "eternal feminine" she is essential woman hood, a force rather than an embodiment, an en ergy rather than a substance. As such she appears cold and inaccessible, beyond the human passions of ecstacy and grief. She is the word made flesh. On reviewing Callahan's total work, it be comes clear that Eleanor is the presiding presence of his vision. In the first section of both books, as the multiple images suggest, Eleanor becomes the doorway both to the natural and to the urban world. In this section we experience the integration and identification of the feminine and the natural world.
