No trace could be found in the Mona Mona region of a " Hile- man " tribe, mentioned by Hale and Tindale, 1933, p. 101. Sharp, 1934, p. 407, identifies the Koko Daua (68) with the " Koko Wansin " of Roth, 1910, map, but by the latter Roth probably meant the Okundjain (65), mentioned under their popular pidgin name, " Koonjan," by Mathews, 1899, p. no. For the Oikand (64), Sharp, loc. cit., erroneously gives " Koko Wanggara," a term applied to them by their neighbours and now by themselves. The " Kauwarang " of Roth, op. cit., p. 95, are the Okaurang (67), now almost extinct. The Okekol and Okuluan or " Possum Tribe " are sub-tribes of the Olkol (63). I encountered no Koko Mini (62), as they are generally called on the Peninsula, but understand they call themselves Akunkun, a term Palmer, 1884, p. 334, gives for their language. They are apparently the same as the " Koogobatha " of Palmer, loc. cit., and the " Mirkin " of Curr, 1886, Vol. II, p. 396. The Aku Nienga (61) are perhaps the same as the " Koko- Nyungal " of McConnel, 1931, p. 18. The " Koko Wara " are mentioned by Roth, 1910, p. 94, McConnel, 1931, p. 15, and Hale and Tindale, 1933, p. 70 ; this term simply means " rough speech/1 but the proper name of the tribe was not discovered. The aku- of 59, 60, 61 and ? 62 is said to be the same as koko-, " speech." But to the west there is a common root, ak-, referring to land, so these terms may be geographical rather than linguistic designations. 59, 60 and 61 are closely related linguistically and in social organization, as are 65 and 67, and also 79-83.

The problem is not of great significance, however, and need not be entered into here. More important is the question raised by the possibility that the Ngatjan, Mamu, Tjirbal, Mudju and perhaps Ngaikungo may have not simply two moieties, but three phratries, the Kuraminya, the Kurakulu, and the Kurabana, a type of organization which would logically fit their social structure and marriage rules. My own investigation of these tribes was limited and my information on this point proves contradictory and inconclusive. The consensus was that Kuraminya and Kurakulu were simply two terms for one social grouping having totems in common, and I have thus described them. It may be, however, that such opinions were simply attempts to square an unusual system with the dominant moiety type of organization found in surrounding tribes.</page><page sequence="5">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 443 Throughout the area each of the moieties has its own peculiar totems and, except among the last five tribes listed (79, 81, 82, 83, and probably 80), there is a strict tabu against any person killing, eating, or in any way harming the chief of these moiety totems. The moiety names Raku, Karaka, (A)Kapokap, Nginka, and Ki all refer to the same small nocturnal bird found in the preceding area. Mirki, Wuti, Nelar, Alar, Orininga and Mbala refer to the night owl or mopoke. These birds and their eggs, although not good eating anyway, are tabu among the tribes where they are the moiety totems. Five of the tribes (71, 74, 75, 76, 77) have supplementary moiety totems, Walar being a small yellow bee, Muranggan and Atar being a larger black bee. In view of the limited sweets available to the natives, it need hardly be added that there are no totemic tabus on the use of the honeys produced by these bees, but some of the tribes have special terms to distinguish moiety totems from others (59, 61 : martjin ; 74, 75, 76, 77 : tjauin). Annually or at less frequent intervals among these tribes with moiety totem tabus a member of one moiety kills the bird totem of the opposite moiety and publicly desecrates and exposes the body. There then follows a ceremonial mock combat between the males of each moiety, in which harmless reed spears are ordinarily used. Occasionally, however, the sacrilege may be considered more seriously; recently among the Wakura a Raku man who had killed mirki was speared through the leg by Mirki men, and among the Oikand it is considered customary for the actual culprit, after the burial of the dead totem, to offer himself to men of the opposite moiety who run a spear through his thigh or cut him with knives, as may be done with a man following the funeral of a person for whose death he is in some way considered responsible. The formal wrestling between distant siblings of the same moiety, often an annual ceremony, is found among the western tribes and is reported for some of the eastern (74, 75, 76). According to a myth of the east-central tribes of this group, the two moiety birds, as anthropomorphic mythical ancestors, were the original inhabitants of the country. Eventually, when other ancestors had come into the land, Mirki was attacked, surrounded by grass fires, and even though he took refuge in a hollow tree, as</page><page sequence="6">444 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA mirki does not, he had to change into a bird to escape. This action led all the other ancestors to change into the various bird, animal, and other forms they have now, and thus brought to a close the mythical ancestral period at the beginning of time. Among the last five tribes mentioned each moiety has several totems, but none of these is tabu to anyone. These moiety totems, here designated individually or collectively by a term (81, 83 : kupi) translated as " world " or by one informant as " nature," include for the Kur abana, which is associated with water {band) the prominent hill at the head of the Mulgrave River near Malanda known as Bartle Frere, the scrub turkey, the white cockatoo, and the white grub, and for the Kuratninya, which is associated with animals or flesh (tninya), a place called Lyman Hill, the scrub hen, the red opossum, and the eaglehawk. These seem to be the chief totems associated with the moieties, and although they may also serve as totems of clans, there seems to be here no general attribution of all clan totems to either one moiety or the other as is the case among neighbouring tribes to the east. There is no good evidence that the sections anywhere in this area are primary totemic groupings, although the sections of the moiety may be directly associated with the moiety totems.28 The patrilineal totemic clan is an important element in the social structure of all of these tribes, although the apparent absence of clan names makes these groupings stand out less distinctly among the tribes in the south-east corner of the area. The clans normally have multiple totems. The local term for dream is generally used to designate clan and sometimes moiety totems, and dreams are interpreted totemically in all the tribes. Other terms may also be employed to indicate totems : 83 : waryu ; kupi, world ; kadjarin, 28 Roth, 1910, p. 102, reports the following totems for Olkol sections : A : various species of poison snakes ; B : goose, plover ; C : carpet snake, bird like mopoke ; D : bird like owl ; Palmer, 1884, p. 304, gives for the Koko Mini sections : A : yam ; B : native companion ; C : grass ; D : nonda fruit. But in reporting " section totems " for the " Koko Wara," Roth, loc. cit., makes it clear that he is dealing rather with moiety or perhaps patrilineal clan totems, for he reports for sections A and D, i.e. Moiety I, the same totems, red kangaroo, dingo, giant lily, brown snake, and owl ; and likewise that sections B and C, i.e. Moiety II, have the same totems, goose, black duck, fresh water crocodile, cockatoo and blue lily.</page><page sequence="7">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 445 dream ; bulo, father's father, for own totems ; ngaki, mother's father, for totems of mother's patrilineal line ; 74, 75, 76 : nguyar, dream ; 71 : yapu, dream ; 70 : ygama, dream ; 68 : piyan- perant, associated with the root pi-, relating to things patrilineal ; yinger, name ; 67 : elpiniyen, root pi- ; 65 : alyula ; rjerpana, name and dream ; 64 : ukal ; ibanger ; ibara, dream ; aipir, name ; kalo, clan ; 63 : uykal ; yalko, dream ; amitha, father's father, for own totems ; 59, 61 : karem, dream. Besides the usual floral and faunal totems, the following are also found as clan totems among the tribes indicated : fire (63, 68) ; water (63, 64, 65, 74) ; green stone (68) ; spears (64, 74, 76) ; baby (64, 74, 76) ; corpse (64, 65, 74) ; ghost (63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 71, 74) or white man (64, 71, 74). In this area there is apparently no general tabu on the killing or eating of clan totems although for certain tribes (58, 62, 69, 72, 73, 78) positive information on this point is lacking. However, among the Koko Daua (68) and the Okundjain (65), somewhat similar in this way to the tribes south of them, an individual avoids the edible totems of his clan while he is mourning the death of a close kin who was a fellow clan member.29 Personal names are derived from one or more of the multiple clan totems or in many instances from the place names of particular clan countries. Among the Ngatjan a personal name, whether derived from a place or other totem, is given by the father who then " puts the name under a rock or in a cave " in the child's own country which is part of the larger clan territory. The rule against marrying a member of the mother's clan, mentioned for the preceding area, is likewise found here, and among the Olkol, at least, the prohibition is extended to include persons who have the same totems as the father's mother. The rule is absent among the Aku Nienga and Aku Laia, where a 29 Roth, 1910, p. 7j, reports that on the Palmer River there is an eating tabu (tami) on the " individual namesake " when this happens to be an animal or plant. He may be referring here to mourning tabus. For the " Koko Wara," Roth, 1909, pp. 179-180, says that the initiands learn to avoid animals of their own " exogamous group/' these being tabu (alnta) to them. However, these food tabus are later removed by the old men, just as the general initiation tabus are lifted in other tribes, and it is thus doubtful whether they are tabus associated with totemic groupings.</page><page sequence="8">446 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA man marries the daughter of a distant mother's brother who may or may not be a member of the mother's clan. Among those tribes for which there is information the land is divided up into unnamed clan domains which include a number of individual named countries. The several countries constituting a clan domain need not be contiguous among the tribes in the south- eastern and north-western parts of the area and perhaps among others as well. Each individual member of the clan is associated with a few of these countries, which become the person's " homeland " (65 : amalakal, my country), and which may provide him with a personal name. A number of Okundjain and Oikand genealogies show that a man, his son and his son's son (or woman, her brother's daughter, and her brother's son's daughter) may all have different homelands within the domain of the one clan, so that strictly speaking the inheritance of land is patrilineal within the limits not of the actual blood patrilineage but of the clan kin. In this area cosmogeny begins with the mythical ancestral epoch in which was established the interrelation between clan ancestors (83 : bulo ; 68 : taykain ; 64 : in-atat, theriomorphic only ; 63 : amitha ; 58 : atnboiba), territories, totems and rites as these are associated to-day. Many of these tribes lack any special term for this period at the beginning of time, but some of them distinguish things ancestral from things present by a special adjectival suffix (68 : -taykain ; 64 : -atat). The Ngatjan and related tribes, however, locating this period in the very distant past {kupila, i.e. time of the totems), call it tjutjapa ; and this " first world " or " world before " was not immediately succeeded by an order identical with the present, as among most other tribes, but as among tribes with maternal personal totems, by an intervening " olden time " or " old-fashioned " time called yaki, the same term be it noted which is used for mother's father and for the totems of amother's clan. Totemic control ceremonies of rather uniform tain type are known for many of these tribes. There is a tendency for the owner of a site to be the operator regardless of the totem controlled, but</page><page sequence="9">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 447 this is not always the case.30 Among these tribes the simple increase ceremony includes not only the cleaning out of the site, but also the naming of specific countries in which the totem should multiply, areas naturally inhospitable to plant or animal species being omitted. Western tribesmen explain that the rites send out spirits (64 : ant ] 65 : amang) of the mythical ancestral animals (64 : in-atat) or other totems which have resided in the place since ancestral times. The increase sites of these same tribes are usually associated with both stones and water ; the places need not be tabu.31 It is not known whether the Olkol have totemic control rites, but informants have described totem centres associated with stones and water which appear to be similar to the control sites of the neighbouring tribes. Tribes in this area also have historical ceremonies reproducing the activities of the mythical ancestors, the most important of these rites being the boys' initiations.32 Physical mutilation of the initiands is noticeably absent here, except that tooth avulsion may be associated with these rites among the Wakura, who also make the boys drink blood donated by patrilineal kin. Nowhere does the tooth avulsion appear to have totemic significance, however, as it 30 Among the Ngatjan, for example, scrub turkey (kupar) may be increased at a tabu area known as Scrub Turkey Hole (Kupar Kolka) established by a scrub turkey ancestor in country near the Butcher's Creek gold-diggings owned by the clan which numbers scrub turkey among its totems. The rite, consisting of stirring up the hole and throwing earth out in all directions, is conducted whenever turkeys are scarce by any man or woman of any clan who has been properly introduced to the site and ceremony by those already initiated. Certain members of the Koko Daua Catfish Clan own an untabued well called Catfish Hole which dates from ancestral times where they may annually increase the fish by cleaning out the hole and scattering earth. A member of the Oikand Ghost Clan increases iguana (inokanter), the totem of another clan, because the lagoon harbouring an Iguana Hole (erkeuo inokanter) is found in his homeland. Another member of the Oikand Ghost Clan similarly increases camp dog puppies, which are not his totems, because the Camp Dog Hole (erkeuo atnud) is in country he owns. Or, among the Okaurang, red pigeon is increased at a site on Yellow Creek which is owned by a clan not otherwise associated with this bird. 31 The association with water probably has nothing to do with preventing these sites from becoming sacred and tabu, since even at the height of the dry season this region affords plenty of other sources for fresh water. 32 58 : Successive stages given by Roth, 1909, 178-182, as boata, urdù, kaundarang, anden, alkir, or " spears," alkentjina ; 60 : stages given by Roth, loe. cit.t as harta, antara, anpi, anpul ; 63 : putja ; 64 : rjarntj, i.e. tabu ; 65 : arebatj, cf. 87 ; 68 : yiral, cf. 44, 45, 86.</page><page sequence="10">448 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA does in northern areas ; nor is there evidence that other tribes make any totemically significant ritual use of human blood. It should be noted that for the " Koko Wara " Roth, 1909, 178, describes the use of elaborate stage properties in the representation of masked ancestors (58 : amboiba) by clansmen who reproduce the mythical roles during the initiation rites. This appears to be the southern- most extension in the Peninsula of the use of elaborate masks in totemic ceremonies, although disguise of participants is a widespread common ritual trait. For some of the western and northern tribes in this area (63, 64, 65, 68) there is evidence of a consistent system of totemic beliefs concerning the life history of the individual's personal spirit or soul. It is believed that these spirits have been in existence since the epoch of the mythical ancestors, with whom they are associated but not genetically connected so that it is improper to speak of persons as being totemic or ancestral reincarnations. In a place associated with water and lying within the boundaries of their own or (64, 68) a phratric clan domain they await their incarnation. In the form of a spirit baby (64 : aryk ant, aryk ampuyk ; 65 : ewut/a yorkon ; 68 : entaka mant ; baby, spirit) such a pre-existent spirit is found, by father or mother, wandering not far from its watery headquarters whence it has issued either on its own initiative (65, 68) or because it was sent forth by its ancestral father's father (63 : amitha ; 64 : atniy) or even by its mother's father (64 : atjifj). Its provenience and thus its clan affiliations are known from the territory in which it was found. In none of these tribes does the finding have to be associated with a parental dream ; rather, it is believed that some small floral or faunal species or other natural phenomenon, not necessarily a totem of the child, is actually encountered under peculiar circum- stances which allow it to be identified as a spirit child which in this form enters the body of the mother. If found by a man, the spirit may enter his flesh and then be transferred to the woman's body by contact, not necessarily sexual, or in food and other objects.33 33 It should be noted that among the Oikand (64) the spirit child may be sent by the mother's father and found directly by the mother so that the father need play no active role in the conception except that he or one of his patrilineal kin of his own or another clan provides the land in which the spirit has resided.</page><page sequence="11">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 449 At death a person's ghost (64 : waygar ; 65 : akyera ; 67 : ayara) remains with the living until it is forgotten and lost in the hordes of ghosts which haunt the bush. But the totemic spirit (64 : ant ; 65 : amaykara ; 68 : tnant) which stemmed from the ancestors does not return to them nor to its clan homeland, but travels to the west across the Gulf of Carpentaria. Among the Wakura, too, the ghost remains behind while the spirit goes west. There is no evidence that this spirit is ever associated with bull- roarers or other sacred objects. VIL Okerlila Type.

Maiabi, 96. Workabunga.34 None of these tribes have named moieties.35 All have four named sections, but strictly speaking these are not totemic groupings in spite of vague attempts by some natives to associate patrilineal clan totems with the sections which ended in the admission that 34 All of these tribes except 84, 85, 89 and 92 have been mentioned in the literature. The Kurandi and Kutanda are two local groups of one tribe which is usually known by the latter term. The Walangama are a south-eastern branch of the Okerkila, by which name they are generally known. The Waumin or sometimes Akwaumin were said by informants to be called Warkamin by neighbouring tribes, but their section terms do not correspond with those given by Mathews, 1898, p. 251, for his " Warkeeman " tribe. Richards, 1926, p. 265, mentions a " Warkaman " tribe in the Chillagoe region. Other than the Waumin I encountered no members of a Warkamin group. These may be a western and an eastern division, with different sections, of what is considered by outsiders as one tribe. The tribes in this area, especially to the south, have been viciously decimated by Europeans who have taken over their land for mining and pastoral exploitation. The Maikulan numbered in 1864, on first contact with whites, 400, in 1883, 200, according to estimates, not necessarily accurate, given to Curr, 1886, Vol. II, p. 322. The Maiabi numbered 250 in 1868, 80 in 1879, according to the same source. Few are left to-day. 35 Roth, 1897, p. 56, gives the matrilineal moieties X : Woodaroo, and Y : Pakutta, for the Maiabi (95), but this information may apply only to those southern Maiabi who mingle with the Maithakudi and other tribes to the south which have named matrilineal moieties. Northern Maiabi informants who understood the moiety organization claimed their tribe lacked it. Roth apparently found no moieties among the Workabunga, southern neighbours of the Maiabi, nor did I.</page><page sequence="12">450 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA totems were correlated only with couples of sections (A-D and B-C), i.e. patrilineal moieties.36 The sections (" skins " or " heads " in pidgin) are as follows :37 Tribes Sections A B C D 84, 85, 89, 93-96 Kuparu Kurkila Wunggu Banbari 93-95 (Roth, Palmer) . .

Ngaritjbela Purarangi Kamarang Paldjaringia In this area the patrilineal clan is well developed, and each is normally associated with several totems. The general term for totem is the same as that for dream (95 : pikain ; 93, 94 : djuykura or pikain ; 92 : yelkoroker ; 91 : tjier ; 90 : ker ; 87, 88, 89 : tjar ; 86 : meterá ; 84, 85 : ibera) and the totemic interpretation of dreams is common throughout the area. Some of the northern tribes also designate totems by the kinship term for father's father (87 : tjarem ; 86 : piter) which is used particularly when the totem is thought of in its role of mythical ancestor. Totems here are predominantly natural species, including recent additions of such 36 For some of these tribes the sections constitute an anomalous structure which can hardly be adjusted to an alternative marriage rule which allows out of generation mating with father's sister's daughter's daughter and thus interferes with the unilineal succession of sections. To prevent a man of section A from marrying by this rule a woman of section D, the woman is affiliated with her mother's section, B, thus becoming a proper mate for A. She thus belongs to two sections, or, as the natives say in pidgin, " She follows her mother's skin and has two heads." This would lead to complete confusion of patrilineal totems if they were correlated with sections, yet patrilineal totemism is the only kind the natives recognize. 37 The section terms given by Roth, 1897, p. 57, or Palmer, 1884, p. 302, for 93, 94, 95, 96 have now, after thirty-five to fifty years, apparently given away to the common Kuparu- Banbari terminology which has quite replaced them among the northern remnants of these detribalized groups. Palmer, loc. cit., gives the following feminine forms for the Maikulan and Maikudan terms : 93, 94 : A : Mandjingo ; B : Karburango ; C : Kudamango ; D : Ngaranngango. Present day informants were unable to verify these terms. (Ng in the names of sections has the sound of rj)</page><page sequence="13">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 451 domesticated animals as (94) sheep, and (86) horses and cattle. However, besides plant or animal species, there are also such totems as the Rainbow Serpent (91, 92), lightning (90), salt and fresh water (88, 90), salt (87), whirlwind (87), saliva (88), boomerang (91), and ghost (86, 87). Among the Waumin we find the explicit recognition of named places as totems ; thus the " dreams " of the Eagle Hawk Clan include kuritela (eagle hawk) and yapitela (a hill now called Mt. Hollowback). Among this tribe we get the only definite evidence for this area of a strict tabu on killing or eating of totems. Not only are the totems of one's own or father's clan avoided, but also those of one's mother's patrilineal clan, and the old people see to it that not even children come into contact with these totems. For the other tribes we either lack positive information or killing and eating tabus are definitely absent. Among the Kunggara and Western Kukatja the totems of a mother recently dead are avoided, and among the former there is also a tabu on totems of any close patri- lineal kin who have recently died. These tabus were applied only to the particular clan totems for which the dead individuals were named, the several totemic personal names of an individual in this area being chosen from a series of names associated with the various totems of the clan. Among most of these tribes the marriage rules lead to what may be termed maternal clan exogamy, a pattern which is usually expressed as a totemic rule to the effect that a man may not marry a woman who has the same totems as his mother, although his wife may be (and frequently is) a member of his father's mother's clan. This rule is absent among the Waumin, however, for they allow a close cross-cousin marriage, and their genealogies show that a man's wife may be a member of his mother's clan and even have the same personal names as the mother. Among the Aripa there is a regional grouping of the clans into the eastern or " Fresh Water People " and the western or " Salt Water People " and there is a tendency for each grouping to be endogamous. The clans are local groups each controlling certain territories and their natural products. These countries need not be contiguous. Particular areas within the clan domain are associated with one or more individual members of the clan. There is evidence that at least some clan totems were localized within the territory of the</page><page sequence="14">452 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA clan through the agency of the mythical ancestors who lived at the beginning of time. Control rites for totemic species were formerly held at specified places among the central tribes of this area and perhaps elsewhere, too. The nature of these ceremonies and the persons responsible for them could not be learned from available informants. Among these same tribes the usual initiation ceremonies for boys (86 : yiral ; 87 : arebayk) are of an historical nature, representing in part the activities of mythical ancestors. The tooth avulsion found among these central tribes is in no way associated with totemism. Typical of neighbouring tribes in the region are the conception beliefs of the Aripa. A spirit child (88 : boetirj) is found usually by the father somewhere in his own clan country. He directs it to the mother whose body it enters. The father sees the spirit in the form of any small active natural agent, very frequently a frog in this area. No special attitude is adopted by parent or child towards this agent species, which may or may not be a clan totem. The spirit child is not believed to be a reincarnation, but was pre-existent in the water hole in its father's clan country and is thus identified with the paternal clan and its totemic complex. It is thought that the agent is actually encountered, and there need be no dream in connection with conception. Among the Waumin conception may also take place in this way ; but if the parents are away from the paternal homeland, the mother may dream of some geographical feature of the father's country, e.g., a hill, which thereupon becomes the child's totem in that one of his personal totemic names will be derived from it.

My own 38 All of these tribes have previously been mentioned in the literature and are easily identifiable. They constitute the northern fringe of a large number of Queens- land tribes which apparently have a similar totemic organization.

All of these tribes, however, have named totemic matrilineal moieties (X and Y). All totems of a moiety are secondarily associated with the two named sections into which each moiety is divided (X : A and C ; Y : B and D). No evidence could be found for the presence of section totems as such.39 The names of these groupings are as follows :40 Tribes Moieties X (A-C) Y (B-D) 101 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Wutaru Parkada 98-100 Utara Parkada 97 Wutaru Malar a 102 Utaru Afolara Tribes Sections A BCD 97-101 . . . . Kuparu Kurkila Wunggu Banbari 102 . . . . Patingo Marinanggo Kangilango Tunbiango With this system of matrilineal moiety totemism there exists also a patrilineal system of totems. Whether these are associated with amorphous patrilineages or with actual patrilineal clans is not clear. However, patrilineal groups which appear to be unnamed are the land-holding units, so that an individual's " homeland " is acquired from his or her close patrilineal kin. The individual also acquires a totemic personal name from these patrilineal kin and at death certain of these relatives must avoid the patrilineal totem to which the name referred although there seems to be no tabu on 39 Roth, 1897, p. 57, and Palmer, 1884, p. 302, report section totems for some of these tribes. However, a tabulation of their data suggests that they are in fact dealing with matrilineal moiety totems ; e.g. for the Kalkadun, Roth gives emu, mountain kangaroo, porcupine, opossum, wallaby, brown snake, " mountain " snake and carpet snake as totems all associated with two different sections, A and C, but fails to note that these two sections constitute the one matrilineal moiety, X. 40 Many Kalkadun (102) now ordinarily use the North Queensland Kuparu- Banbari terminology. No other meanings could be discovered for either moiety or section names. The terms are applied to both sexes. My own material on the equivalence of the Kalkadun sections is confusing for one informant insisted that Patingo was equivalent to C, Kangilango to A, Marinanggo to D, and Tunbiango to B.</page><page sequence="16">454 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA this totem during the individual's lifetime. Whether or not these patrilineal totems are associated with the patrilineal " homelands " by means of a typical ancestral mythology could not be learned. A person also considers as his own the totems of his own matri- lineal moiety, and several of these, probably associated with a matrilineal clan grouping within the moiety, provide him with personal totemic names. From childhood on, for both sexes, there is a tabu on eating, though not on killing, the matrilineal animal totems. Since animal totems predominate in this area, it is doubtful whether this tabu is actually extended to all the moiety totemic animals. The term for totem, apparently both patrilineal and matrilineal (101 : pikain) also means " dream," and dreams in which totems appear are interpreted in reference to persons or groups associated with the totem. While bull-roarers (102 : wilmura) are used in the initiations and perhaps for magical purposes, there is no evidence that such artifacts are intimately associated with the spiritual life of each individual. Information on conception and death beliefs, ancestral mythology, totemic control or historical rites, and other aspects of totemism in this area is lacking. IX. Laierdila Type. Extant tribes : 103. Indjilindji, 104. Ngoborindi, 105. Iukala, 106. Iangkala, 107. Bentinck Islanders, 108. Laierdila, 109. Eastern Karawa, no. Wanyi, in. Kunindiri. Extinct tribe : Minkin.41 41 All of these tribes except 111 have been mentioned in the literature and are easily identifiable. Aspects of the totemic organization of this area are discussed in Sharp, 1935. Laierdila and mainland informants claim that the social organization of the Bentinck Islanders, whom they call Marlanunda or Maldanunda, is similar to their own, but as the Bentinck people have been quite isolated as regards both native and European contact, this information is of doubtful value. No living Minkin could be found in the Burketown area and the tribe is apparently extinct, probably having suffered severely from the yellow fever which decimated Burketown in the 1860's. Informants agreed that they belonged in this area rather than in Area VII. It is probable that the Binbinga, Alaua and perhaps other Northern Territory tribes to the west who lack named patrilineal moieties have a totemic system of Laierdila type. For these tribes, as well as those of Tjingali type to the south-west and of Mara type to the north-west having a very similar totemic organization, see Radcliffe-Brown, 1931, and Elkin, 1933, pp. 69 ff.</page><page sequence="17">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 455 The totemic organization of these tribes is characterized by the presence of eight named sub-sections organized as unnamed totemic patrilineal moieties and semi-moieties ; unnamed patrilineages with some totemic associations through land tenure, but no named clans ; multiple linked totems are predominantly natural species but include land and mythical ancestors and are tabu in most tribes. All of these tribes have eight named sub-sections, known locally as "head" (108: lelka) or "hair" (108: djurel)*2 They are correlated throughout the area with an Aranda type of kinship structure, and may be listed as follows :43 Tribes Sub-Sections A1 B1 C1 D1 Masculine - 103-106, 108-111 Ngaribelang Buralang Kamar ang Paliarinyi Feminine - 103-106 . . Niwanama Nuralama Nimarama Nuliarima 109-111 . . Noanama Nuralama Niamarama Nuliarima A2 B2 C2 D2 Masculine - 103-106, 108-111 Bulanyi Rangola Yakameri Bangarinyi Feminine - 103-106 . . Nurianma Nangalama Tjaminanyo Naungarima 109-111 . . Nulaima Nangalama Yakamerina Nungarima The four patrilineal couples of sub-sections are organized as totemic unnamed patrilineal semi-moieties (1 : A1-D2 ; 2 : A^D1 ; 3: BM:1; 4: B2-C2) and moieties (1 : AM^-A^D1 ; II: B1-C1-B2-C2). Associated with each of the four semi-moieties is a series of totems which varies somewhat from one region to another. A more limited series of different totems is likewise associated with 42 Roth, 1910, p. 100, gives only four sections for the Ngoborindi, equivalent to the sub-sections given here as A2, B2, C2 and D2. My informants, giving eight sub- sections for this tribe, were not aware of any recent change from a four section system, though this is possible since the Ngoborindi are on the extreme eastern border of the eight sub-section area. It would appear more likely, however, that Roth, coming from a four section area, not unnaturally failed to record more than four groupings, as he also failed to record feminine forms of the section terms. 43 The Laierdila use only the mainland masculine forms which are applied to men and women alike. No other meanings could be discovered for the terms. The general concept of stone (108 : kamar) is associated with the Kamarang-Yakameri semi-moiety in some tribes. H</page><page sequence="18">456 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA each of the two moieties, and each moiety is, of course, secondarily associated with the totems of its two constituent semi-moieties.44 Although unnamed, these groupings find further expression in ceremonial opposition, as in the boys' initiation when the two moieties are opponents in a kind of football game or when the members of one moiety circumcise or subincise boys of the opposite moiety, and also in reciprocal services, as during funeral and mourning rites. The totems of an individual are all the totems of his own semi- moiety and moiety. All other members of his own semi-moiety have exactly the same totems and the relationship of all of these persons to these totems is of the same kind. Each of the semi-moieties is ideally correlated with one patrilineal descent line of the Aranda type kinship system, so that the totemic groupings are normally patrilineal. In cases of alternative marriages, however, the sub-section and thus semi-moiety affiliation of the offspring is usually, but not always, determined on the basis of the mother's sub-section, rather than the father's. This simply expresses the feeling for partilineality in a negative, rather than a positive, way ; it is considered more important that a child should not be in his mother's groupings than that he should be in his father's. This " throwing away of the father " in these cases is thus consistent with the principle of patri- lineal descent. It occasionally places a child in the moiety opposite his father's, but more frequently, in cases of " little bit wrong " marriages, the child is in his own father's sub-section and semi- moiety or else in the other semi-moiety of his father's moiety so that he does have all or certain totems in common with his patrilineal kin. Clan totemism is apparently absent in this area unless the four semi-moieties are regarded as clans. A grouping more like the typical clan is the small, unnamed, exogamous land-holding unit of a few siblings or parallel cousins and their known agnatic 44 A partial list of the totems associated with each semi-moiety and moiety is given in Sharp, 1935, Chart III. It should be noted that the sub-sections placed in the B position of that report are here placed in the A position, and the others adjusted accordingly, in order that the arrangement here may be consistent with that used by Radcliffe-Brown, 1931.</page><page sequence="19">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 457 descendants, the patrilineage or joint family. Its solidarity rests primarily on close kinship bonds and a common interest in territory which consists of a number of usually contiguous named countries of varying size. These countries are held individually or jointly, being acquired through inheritance or gift from older members of the patrilineage, and normally they cannot be alienated to persons outside this group. Control of real property rests with the individual, though its use is regulated by kinship, but the group as a whole has a common interest in the countries of its members which constitute a " homeland " (108 : biel yiewer) for them all. Through kinship, certain rights are also accorded the individual in all countries associated with any one of his patrilineal kin, all such countries being known by a special categorical term (108 : dulmar). Totems associated with the countries of the dulmar are normally those of one's own semi-moiety ; totems associated with homeland countries constitute a small constellation within the semi-moiety totems and tend to become particularly related to the patrilineage which thus assumes a certain totemic character. The offspring of alternative marriages, however, acquire patrilineage land although their totems may differ from those of their patrilineal kin. In the various tribal myths the totems are associated with the different countries through the agency of mythical ancestors or " story people " (108 : yul marwena ; 106 : marwa yura ; 105 : mar a yula ; 109, no : poretji)^ who lived in the earliest " dream times/' The term for ancestor may also be applied to totems, or these may be called " dreamings " (108 : kwal kudjin ; 105 : blent jinit). The division of totems between the moieties tends to associate natural phenomena of the rainy season with Moiety I and of the dry season with Moiety II, and there are other examples of the linkage of totems. The totems are predominantly natural species although cultural and other forms such as the boomerang, fighting stick, paint, leg chafe, corpse, ghost, sky world, Rainbow Serpent and other mythical beings also appear. 45 Compare the Umbaia and Ngandji term for the altjeriya, poaradju, reported by Spencer and Gillen, 1904, p. 12.</page><page sequence="20">458 TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA Among the mainland tribes a tabu on eating or killing semi- moiety totemic species is enforced for both sexes from childhood on ; among the Laierdila there is no tabu, even in connection with death. Dreams of totems or countries are interpreted in reference to individuals or groups associated with them. The alleged appearance of a totem in connection with a corpse is used as an aid in identifying the person or group magically responsible for the death. There is a rather vague belief that totems associated with a country give good luck to owners and bad luck to trespassers. Personal names may be derived from the totems of one's own semi-moiety or moiety. As such names are often inherited from a dead close patrilineal relative, regardless of sex, the same names may keep reappearing in one patrilineage, thus strengthening the vague association between such a group and a particular constellation of totems within the larger semi-moiety series. At any time, however, new names may be introduced into the lineage, being either acquired from distant patrilineal kin or invented. In some instances the mythical ancestors established totem centres where non-secret increase ceremonies are now conducted by the individual who owns the site or by other persons. When the site is stirred up in various ways, the totemic spirits (108 : wan) which stem from the ancestral totem (108 : kwar) left there, are " hunted out " for the benefit or harm of the whole community.46 Tribal or inter-tribal historical rites representing the activities of the ancestors are held during the dry season. These include a series of initiation rites (108 : kandjauin) for boys, during which 46 Typical of these sites is that at Bogatjinar on the Dugong River, Mornington Island, in Buralang-Kamarang semi-moiety country owned by Puntj, a Buralang. Here certain underwater holes are the tracks of a mythical ancestral hawk-man, a " story hawk " or " dream hawk " (108 : kwar bogatji) and a Buralang-Kamarang totem. By " building a fire " over these holes, Puntj can increase the south-east trade winds, i.e. bring the wet season to a close. Both fire and the south-east trades are totems of the Buralang-Kamarang semi-moiety of the " dry season " moiety. In neighbouring Ngaribelang-Bangarinyi country of the opposite moiety are holes associated with an ancestral iguana (108 : kwar daual) and crab (108 : kwar datjur). To-day anyone, by shaking bushes over these " tracks " and brushing them out, can hunt out spirit iguanas (wan daual) and crabs (wan dayur) which become real animals.</page><page sequence="21">TRIBES AND TOTEMISM IN NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA 459 they are circumcised or subincised. On the mainland there are also initiatory ceremonies for girls. In this area a person is not believed to be a reincarnation of his mythical ancestors or totems nor is he supposed to originate spiritually in his own " homeland/1 Conception beliefs are of the typical ".spirit baby " (108 : wan yura) kind, but the circumstances of the " conception " do not normally affect the individual's relation either to land or totems, there being no correlation between the small animal or other natural form which the spirit child assumes, the place it is found, or the person who finds it and the totemic associations of the resulting person. The spirit babies can apparently reside anywhere. Sometimes, but not necessarily, the spirit baby appears in a dream to one of the close kin of the child and announces what his personal totemic or " dream " name shall be. This name will be accepted as placing the child in the semi-moiety associated with this name and totem. These beliefs thus provide a cultural mechanism whereby the offspring of an alternative marriage may be placed in his father's semi-moiety, regardless of the sub-section affiliation of the mother, though this fiction is rarely used. Nor is a person necessarily associated with his totems or his countries in death. The spirit (108 : wan) of the dead proceeds towards the sunrise, the place of the dead (108 : Yilitjilan), while the ghost hovers about the place of burial until it is eventually lost in the general horde of tribal ghosts. The corpse may be buried in any country. Bullroarers are used in connection with initiation and in love magic, but no evidence of any totemic association between an individual or his spirit and some particular sacred bullroarer could be discovered.
