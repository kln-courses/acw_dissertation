<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FABLE OF THE BABYLONIAN TREE PART II: TRANSLATION* CHRISTOPHER J. BRUNNER, New York, New York THE present translation divides the text and numbers the verses as in the edition of M. Nawwdbi.1 That publication may also be consulted for a romanized tran- scription of the text (which gives Parthian interpretation of all ideographic forms). Here Naww~bi's interpretation is not always reflected, even when his reading is followed. In several instances it has seemed preferable simply to adhere to the manuscripts' forms rather than to emend; these are indicated in the commentary notes. Words which are interpreted essentially from context are marked with asterisks. The commentary notes are not intended to be exhaustive but to complement the previous studies (cited in Part I) and to refer to parallel material both earlier and later than this text. 1 There has grown a tree over in Astir province. 2 Its trunk is dry; its crown is moist. 3 Its leaf resembles a reed; its fruit resembles a grape. 4 It bears sweet fruit for people. 5 That lofty tree and a goat contested together: 6 "I am superior to you in many kinds of things. 7 In Xwanirah land there is no tree of my build. 8 For the king eats of me when I newly bear fruit. 9 I am ships' planking; I am the mast for sails. 10 They make brooms of me which put in order house and home. 11 They make pestles of me which pound barley and rice. 12 They make fans of me for the fires. 13 I am shoes for farmers; I am *sandals for the barefoot. 14 They make ropes of me which bind your legs. 15 They make clubs of me which break your neck. 16 They make pegs of me which hang you upside down. 17 I am fuel for fires which roast you terribly. 18 In summer I am shade for the heads of governors. 19 I am milk for farmers, honey for noblemen. 20 They make boxes of me for medicines. 21 They carry (these) province physician to physician. to province, 22 I am a nest for little birds, shade for wanderers.

COMMENTARY 1. On "Asilr" see Part I of this article, n. 1. 2. "Crown" (sar), lit. "head." On this and other parts of the palm, see B. Landsberger, The Date Palm and Its By-Products according to the Cuneiform Sources,2 p. 22. The anthropomorphism implied in this term was discussed by the Mughal emperor Babur (d. A.D. 1530), an enthusiastic observer of plant life: "People say that the date-palm amongst vegetables resembles an animal in two respects: one is that, as, if an animal's head be cut off, its life is taken, so it is with the date-palm, if its head is cut off, it dries off."3 For the second point, see under vv. 43-44. 3. Cf. Bdbur-Nama, p. 508: "Its fruit is like a bunch of grapes, but much larger." 7. Xwanirah is the central continent of the seven which comprise the earth disk; it contains the known, civilized world.4 In Babrius's fable no. 64, the fir-tree similarly boasts of its stature. Cf. the Persian Ewe and Grapevine [EG, see Part I, p. 197], lines 19-20, 69-71: O decrepit ewe, get away from me quickly; for nothing in the world is better than the grape .... God... chose... that there would not be [any plant] on the earth's face like the grapevine. 9. The fir-tree of Babrius no. 64 declares: "I am the ridge-pole of the house; I am the keel of ships." 10. Cf. the praise of the date-palm in "Inanna and the Gardener 8u-kalle-tuda" (Landsberger, Date Palm, p. 10): "Its net of fibers will serve in the king's palace for cleaning." 11. In the Akkadian "Tamarisk and Palm" the tamarisk declares: " ... I thresh, and corn, on which mankind thrives, I thresh" (W. G. Lambert, Babylonian Wisdom Literature [BWL] [Oxford, 1960], p. 159.16). 13. Cf. Landsberger, Date Palm, p. 23. 14. Cf. ibid., pp. 10, 18-19, 21, and 24. 15.

Besides the advantage pertaining to the ritual (the cleansing of some demons from the body, in particular a greater portion of pollution and bad flavor) . .. one [reason] is mercy for the sheep. By that method there is less fear and less pain for it from the applying of the knife. 17. Palm fibers are mentioned as part of the fuel for the human parents' first fire (Bd. 14.21/p. 103.13). See also Landsberger, Date Palm, pp. 49-50. An allusion in Bd. 17 A.1/p. 122.7-8 might refer either to the date-palm's use as fuel or to the serrated appear- ance of the hemispherical crown and of the stem with its residual leaf-stalk bases: "the date-palm, which one calls the split-up (abar-kirrenidag) plant." The latter explanation might seem more likely. But for the possibly literal sense of the epithet, compare the Middle Persian Yasna 71.8: "Like the fire, when one splits up (abar kirrened) fuel which is dry, pure, and well looked after for the existence of the sacrifice, so that [the fire] burns it." 19. One may make a general comparison of the economic role of the coconut in south India, as summarized by the fourteenth-century traveler Ibn Battilta and the sixteenth- century Franciscan missionary, John da Marignolli. Ibn Battfita includes the comment: "Milk is made from them as well as oil and honey." Friar John observed: "Now the Nargil is the Indian nut. Its tree has a most delicate bark and very handsome leaves like those of the date-palm. .... [As to the fruit:] Both oil and sugar can be made from it." 6 In pre-Islamic Iranian taxonomy, dates and coconuts were grouped together with nuts and seeds in the "woody" (darinag) plant group, whose edible members are enumerated in the Middle Persian text "Xusraw, Son of Kawdd, and a Page": The coconut, when they eat it with sugar: in the Indian language they call it anarggl, and in Persian they call it "Indian walnut," ... Herat dates which are stuffed with walnuts .... . 22. In Arabia, "many other species of birds [in addition to the ring-necked parakeet, which feeds on the young fruit], bulbuls especially, like to nest in date palms and often use palm fibres as nesting material" (Paul Lunde, "A History of Dates," Aramco World Magazine, March/April 1978, p. 22; see also for summation of other date-palm motifs here discussed). 23. Compare, however, Ibn al-'Awwdm's instructions for the careful planting of date stones." 24. The palm is, of course, anxious about the possible tapping or removal of the "heart" or "cheese," the living core of his head. See Landsberger, Date Palm, pp. 13-16; Babur-Nama, pp. 508-9. 6 Mahdi Husain, trans., The Rehla of Ibn Battp.ta (India, Maldive Islands and Ceylon) (Baroda, 1953), p. 198; cf. Bdbur-Ndma, p. 509. On the use of dates in preparing honey, see J. Newman, The Agricultural Life of the Jews in Babylonia between the Years 200 C.E.-500 C.E. (London, 1932), pp. 99-100.

For the emphasis on the crown, note the criticism of the laurel tree in the Akkadian "Fable of the Willow": "Your top is not luxuriant" (BWL, p. 165.13). In Mesopotamia the aesthetics of trees must have been strongly influenced by "the palm, the king of the trees" (BWL, p. 165.17). The second half-verse is identical with one in the Middle Persian Ayadgir i Zarjrin (see Part I, p. 196). 26. This verse is all the more apt in that the palm may itself yield both wine and bread. For the former, see Landsberger, Date Palm, p. 13. For the latter, a recipe is furnished by Ibn al-'Awwim:9 Dates from a green fruit stalk may be used to make bread as follows: Remove their skin and cut their soft inner portions into small pieces; then dry them thoroughly in the sun. When these pieces are ground to powder and boiled once or twice with a salt solution (to remove the acrid taste) and treated with leaven from wheat or barley flour and left alone for a time, they can then be kneaded into dough with water mixed with salt and baked. 27. The Akkadian "Tamarisk and Palm" also depicts the date as a food available to all. The palm asserts: The orphan girl, the widow, the poor man [ ... ] Eat without stint my sweet date [... ] The gardener speaks well of me, A benefit to both slave and magistrate. . my fruit makes the baby grow, Grown men eat my fruit (BWL, pp. 161.20-21, 163.26-29). Note the suggested restoration of Callimachus's iamb 4.75: "First, the fruit of the olive is the food [of the poor]."'0 3.. The second half-verse is most easily read: basn-it mdn&amp;d djw-djw. 34. JamUAd, the archetype of kings, was the most renowned of the mythical P6Aidd dynasty; he ruled for the greater part of the millennium of Libra (Bd. 33.1, 36.5/pp. 211.8-9, 239.2-4), in which human history began." "Happy age" may also be rendered, in an astrological sense, "auspicious age." For example, it is said of Mani: "You were born in an auspicious sign" (zdd he pad farrox axtar).12 35. The first half-verse is read (with the manuscripts) ranj i diwan. Perhaps such a use of ranj is archaic; in Manichean and Zoroastrian literature the word connotes "(virtuous) toil." Note "toil in work and the cultivation of the world's prosperity" (ranj i pad kir ud warzisn abaddnih i gjh1n); "Adda applied much labor in those lands" (add pad awin sahrdn was ranj burd).'3 The most notable "binding" of a demon was Fridan's mastery of Dahik (Bd. 29.9, 33.33-35/pp. 198.6-9, 219.14-220.4). Note an apparently 9 M. Abdur Rahman Khan, "Elucidation," p. 63. 10 R.

Compare the willow attacking the laurel: "The idiot of the trees... " (BWL, p. 165.9). 39. A lecture on the need of the wise and the foolish to consult with one another occurred in the Middle Persian translation of the allegorical tales of the Sanskrit Panica- tantra. It survives in Syriac and Arabic versions; see T. Ndldeke, Der Erzdhlung vom Mdusekdnig und seine Ministern: ein Abschnitt der Pehlewi-Bearbeitung des altindischen Fiirstenspiegels, Abh. Konig. Gesell. Wiss. zu Gattingen, vol. 25, phil.-hist. Kl., no. 3 (Gdttingen, 1879), pp. 40-43. 41. The goat might be alluding mockingly to a distinct text similar to the one mentioned by Strabo (see Part I, p. 196). 42. Cf. "Tamarisk and Palm": "You, Tamarisk, are a useless tree. What are your branches ? Wood, without fruit" (BWL, p. 163:22-23). 44. On this familiar feature of date-palm cultivation, see Landsberger, Date Palm, pp. 18-19; Ibn al-'Awwdm (trans. M. Abdur Rahman Khan), p. 63; Babur-Ndma, pp. 18-19. 47-52. Regarding the milk used in Zoroastrian ritual, see J. J. Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees, 2d ed. (Bombay, 1927), pp. 279-80, 289, etc. (index, s.v. Jivam). Since milk is mingled with the plant/god H6m16 during the yasna rite, it is quite appropriate that Ham should be mentioned here, as well as the supreme god Ohrmazd, in whose honor the yasna is performed. GS'urwdn, the soul of the Primal Bull (Bd. 4 A/pp. 46-47) and patron of animal life (Bd. 3.14/p. 35.2-7), may be mentioned here simply because an animal is speaking. He does not receive any special rites.17 53. The uses indicated here and in vv. 58 and 77 are summed up in Geoponica (see Part I, n. 44) 18.9.3: "The hair is necessary for cords and bags and for nautical uses." 60-62. See EG 35: "From my skin there will be a beautiful ('seven-colored') spread" (ghdli-yi haft-rang). 64. The meaning is perhaps clarified by comparison with EG 37: "I am a worthy seating-place for the world." 67-76. In the fragmentary Akkadian "Ox and Horse," the ox enumerates the uses of its hide for military equipment (BWL, p. 179:10-15). 70. In "Tamarisk and Palm," the palm tree boasts of being made into harness (BWL, p. 159:18-20). For the goat's claim in the present text, cf. EG 36, 59-60: From my skin there will be straps and girths.... Cloths for caparisoned horses, (and) hobbles, will be from the sheep's skin, O lord! '4 A. D. H.

The text fittingly names two heroes who would have been as familiar in the epics of the Arsacid period as they are in the Persian 9dhndmah (in the forms Rustam and Isfandydr). Spandeddd (the son of Wist'sp and one of the leaders against the Turanian Arjdsp), since he figures in sacred history, naturally has a role in the Ayd1dgr i Zarjrin. But that text also assumes familiarity with Rustam, even though it does not (in the manner of the S~hndmah) depict his rivalry with Spandeddd:18 was ested *9ifarg i Rddestahm was kantigr i purr tigr ud was zrih i rosn ud was zrih i ahdrkard There were many Rustam-*axes, many quivers full of arrows, and many shining panoplies and many four [times] tempered (?) [steel] panoplies. For the term c&amp;ahar-kard (lit. "made four") and, in a similar context, haft-kard ("made seven"), cf. Nyberg, Manual, vol. 2, p. 113. 72. The depiction of the two warriors mounted, Indian fashion, on elephants could be regarded as either as Arsacid survival (a reminiscence of Bactria and India) or a late Sasanian intrusion due to sixth-century A.D. Indian influences. Note an even clearer Indian motif in the Ayddggr i Zarjrdn-the fourfold division of the army according to Indian military theory:'9 uW karawan warz kunind ud pilban pad pil rawind ud starban pad star rawind ud ward nddr pad warden rawind His troops pass muster, and the elephantarchs move out on elephants, and the cavalry move out on and the charioteers move out on (their) chariots. (their) steeds, Here the infantry is placed first, contrary to the order of terms in the Sanskrit com- pound hasty-adva-ratha-padatam. This deviation would have been all the easier if the reciters of the Ayddgqr had in mind the game of chess, where the pawns (payg) occupy their own row. The order of the back row (K/Q's B1, Ktl, and R1) is given correctly: elephant (pil), horse (asp), and chariot (rah).20 The second half-verse has been read in accordance with the manuscripts: ddrind gydn zdhr andar.

The Zoroastrian "Lineage of Animals" groups the marten and some other Muste- lidae (but also the squirrel) into a weasel "genus" (Bd. 13.20/p. 96.11-13). Use of the name Tuxir for the region of the upper Oxus necessarily post-dates the conquest of present-day northern Afghanistan by migrating tribes in the second century B.C.21 82. On the ritual cord, see Modi, Religious Ceremonies, pp. 173-75. Aelian makes mention of the white hair of "Caspian goats" (De natura animalium 17.34). It is possible that the goat means the Caspian Sea by "Warka' Sea" (see next note); if so, he would be saying that his wild species ranges through the Hindu Kush, its western extensions, and the Alburz mountains. 89. The Warka' (or Frdxwkard) Sea is a vast ocean in later Zoroastrian mythology.22 91-92. The eye-chested, the ear-chested, and other peculiar or demi-animal races are listed in the "Lineage of Mankind" (Bd. 14.38-39/p. 107.2-14). The ear-chested people and the cynocephali also appear in the 9hndmah, which locates them in Mizandaran.23 94-98. See EG 31-34, 43-49: First I yield butter; further, I give milk, also cheese and curds and oil in measure. From my milk there is clotted cream for the world. There is fresh cheese in my heart.... Beggar and king and lords and poor man all take refuge in the ewe. All people are in need of my milk, especially my curds and confections and cheese. For there are Kurds and Lurs and Turks and Tajiks, blind and seeing and lame and sheikhs, who altogether need the ewe. See also the herder's products in "Enkidu and Dumuzi" 92-118.24 Abil Bakr as-Sili (d. A.D. 946-47), in an elegy on his goat, rhapsodizes on the abundance of milk she supplied.25 100. On the routine daily ablutions (not now performed on a skin), see Modi, Religious Ceremonies, pp. 88 ff. 101. "Xusraw and Page" 62-63 enumerates musical instruments, as well as the appropriate props for jugglers, acrobats, and other entertainers. 105-6.

On the latter, see also R. N. Frye, Notes on the Early Coinage of Transoxania Numismatic Notes and Monographs, no. 113 (New York, 1949), p. 49. "Two coppers" should have purchased enough dates for a meal; the Palestinian cUlla, traveling in Sas- anian Mesopotamia, refers to the cheapness of dates: "a basketful of honey for a zuz" (i.e., a drahm; Newman, Agricultural Life, p. 22). The Talmud also refers to a case in which a high-quality date-palm (one of the "Persian" species) was destroyed, and 33 1/3 zuz had to be paid in compensation (idem, Agricultural Life, p. 98). The goat's boast is thus rather artful. In EG 50, the ewe takes a less aristocratic approach: "My buyers are more numerous than your leaves." Throughout the Middle Iranian text, however, the language employed by the two opponents is such as would be suitable to a court or provincial noble. 107. With the goat's peroration compare the ewe's exordium (EG 29-30): Behold my produce from the lord God; I am a prince by God's favor. 110. The striking parallel between this verse and Matthew 7:6 ("do not throw your pearls before swine") has been discussed by G. Widengren, who views the metaphor as an Iranian loan to the Aramaic-speaking world. This suggestion necessarily remains uncertain, since the date of the verse cannot be determined. The symbolism of the Gnostic "Song of the Pearl" may well have been lost if that narrative came to circulate orally in Iran. Or, vice versa, the religious text may have been based on familiar secular stories (whether ultimately of Iranian or other origin). Compare the Manichean parable of the pearl-borer, which adapted a secular (but didactic) tale from the introduction to the Middle Persian translation of the Pai~catantra.26 111. But, just as Matthew 7:6 also has a characteristic Near Eastern image ("do not give dogs what is holy"), so v. 111 follows the pearl metaphor with a familiar Iranian reference. The divinities Wahrdm and Dahmin Afrin may assume the "form of a rutting camel" (ustrahe Eahrpa va~airyaos in Yalt 14.11 [cf. 14.12 and 39, 17.13]) or "the form of a superlative camel, superlatively rutting with rut" (ustrahe kahrpa ayryehe ayrya.+ma Su.mastdmahe, Pursisnihd 31; Middle Persian "rutting with a superlative rut."27 114. This truism about goats has been seen in Geoponica 18.18 (translated in Part I, p. 198). It also occurs in 18.9: "The she-goats delight in mountainous places." 115. The seasonal movement of goats is alluded to by Abfi Bakr as-Sfili (see n. 25): "In summer she enjoyed comforts of the cold water; in winter she warmed herself by the fire." The goat neglected to boast of its delicious meat or the use of its fat for cooking (cf. "Xusraw and Page" 21 and 53 and as-Siili). The date-palm, too, was by no means exhaustive, forgetting baskets, matting, etc. (Landsberger, Date Palm, pp. 9-10).28 It might also have boasted of the alleged medicinal properties of dates (in agreement with 26 G. Widengren, Iranisch-semitische Kulturbegeg- nung in parthischer Zeit (Cologne-Opladen, 1960), p. 36; the "Song of the Pearl" in Hans Jonas, The Gnostic Religion, 2d ed. (Boston, 1967), pp. 112 ff. The Middle Persian Paficatantra is attested by its Arabic trans- lation; see T. Naldeke, "Burz5es Einleitung zum Buche Kalila wa Dimna," Schriften der Wiss. Gesell. in Strassburg 12 (1912): 19. Cf. Henning, "Sogdian Tales," Bulletin of the School of Oriental (and African) Studies 11 (1945): 465-69. 27 Cf. C.

Humbach, Pursilnihd: A Zoroastrian Catechism (Wiesbaden, 1971), p. 49 (using the basic meaning of masta-, "intoxicated"; see also for Vedic formal parallels). 28 For uses in modern Iran, see G.

Perhaps the story told to Alexander the Great in the Persian Iskandarnamah about a magic palm reflects some more ancient Iranian folklore: They said: There is a tree in our city in the king's courtyard which is always green, summer and winter. That tree bears dates, and any sick person who eats of those dates becomes healthy in an hour. This tree had grown out of the bones of a dead king; its fruit not only healed, it also rendered pregnant the daughter of the living king.29 116. Note the uses in weaving proudly claimed in "Tamarisk and Palm" (BWL, pp. 157.5, 159.24, 163.35). 117. Note EG 119-22, where a moral is worked into the conclusion: When the ewe was unable to reply to the vine, with truth of heart she proclaimed to it her affection: "The compassionate one should have mindfulness of a friend; no deed can be better than this." Note the moral of Babrius's fable (Part I, p. 197). 29 I. After ed., Iskandarnamah (Tehran, 1964), pp. 229-31. For the tree as a fertility figure, see, for example, J. G. Frazer, The New Golden Bough (New York, 1961), p. 45.</page></plain_text>
