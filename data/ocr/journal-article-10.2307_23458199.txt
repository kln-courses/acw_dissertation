The objects were radiographed by means of gamma rays and thermal neutrons, and in some cases by X-rays. They also underwent a detailed visual examina tion, using a x75 magnifying lens. Their elemental composition was established by atomic absorption and by neutron activation analyses, and lead isotope abundances were determined. The project was conducted with three main objectives in mind: 1. To study the techniques employed in the pro duction of these objects in order to augment our knowledge of Chalcolithic metal technology, of which the Nahal Mishmar hoard is the most re markable surviving example. 2. To determine the chemical composition of the objects and establish the possible provenance of the raw materials used in their production. These issues are of major importance for the study of the material culture of the Chalcolithic period and have acquired additional significance due to recent discoveries in the Negev of similar metal artifacts. The question of provenance became particularly pertinent after the recent excava tions conducted in the extensive mining district at Feinan in the Arabah. 3. To correlate the results obtained by the above mentioned methods, relate them to earlier studies and, in conclusion, interrelate the new data with their archaeological context, paying special attention to Chalcolithic metallurgy. The objects were selected to include the main typological categories of the hoard: 'crowns', maces, maceheads, and tools (but not the more unusual standards, scepters, and vessels). It also represents the most significant variants in terms of shape and style of each type, such as maces with globular or disk-shaped heads, and globular or disk-shaped maceheads. Various types of decoration are represented: an undecorated and an ornate 'crown', maces with diverse horizon tal or diagonal ridges, maces and maceheads with knobs and bosses, and also plain objects. The color of the metal was taken into consid eration, and some outstanding shades were included in the selection. Since the objects were first examined radiographically we were able to select examples that varied in their interior structures, including all types of globular mace heads. The quality of casting and surface treatment were also considered to ensure that the twenty-eight objects represent as many variants as possible. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXT The Nahal Mishmar hoard, also known as 'The Judean Desert Treasure', was discovered in the so called Cave of the Treasure during the exca vation season of 1961, conducted within the framework of full-scale explorations of the Judean Desert caves. The results were published by P. Bar-Adon, the excavator, in both Hebrew</page><page sequence="2">96 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. (1971) and English (1980). Found in a natural side-niche, blocked by a large stone, the hoard was separated from the occupation remains pre served in the rest of the cave. The objects were piled up on, and partly covered by, a reed mat, in no apparent order (Bar-Adon 1980:7, 15). The discovery of an unprecedentedly large hoard of 429 objects—comprising 416 metal objects and six ivory artifacts, six hematite maceheads, and one limestone macehead—all outstanding in their shape, design, and perfect preservation— came as a complete surprise. The 416 metal objects of the hoard belong to a surprisingly limited number of types. The most numerous are the plain maceheads, accounting for more than half of all objects: listed in the publication are 251 roughly globular and elon gated (piriform) maceheads and eleven disk-shaped maceheads. The second largest category is the maces ('standards' in Bar Adon's nomenclature), ninety-two with globular or elongated heads, nine with disk-shaped heads. One mace, structured as two superim posed maces, has both a disk and a globular head (Bar-Adon 1980:82, 61-68). A similarly struc tured mace also has two heads (Bar-Adon 1980:61, 61-67; and below, Catalogue, No. 6). In addition, there are some richly decorated maceheads and 'standards' of unusual shape and decoration, which escape definition and cannot be grouped under one heading. In this category are included some of the finest finds: e.g. the macehead bearing two antithetic ibexes in the round, in a 'Siamese twin' arrangement, flanked by tool(?)-shaped elements (Bar-Adon 1980:101, 61-119); the 'Ibex Standard' (Bar-Adon 1980:42-45, 61-88); and the 'Vulture Standard' (Bar-Adon 1980:102-103, 61-151). All the above are hollow lengthwise. There are also six solid 'scepters' (Bar-Adon 1980:90-93,61-152 to 61-156, 61-93), different from the maces and the standards both in shape and the technique of casting, and ten large, open cylinders, which— by association with a more modern shape—were designated 'crowns'. Three objects are in the form of situlae, and one is in the shape of a deep bowl with a round base (Bar-Adon 1980:108 Ill, 61-162 to 61-165). There is one jar with a slender neck and three horn-shaped objects, each with two suspension holes below the rim (Bar-Adon 1980:104-107,61-166 to 61-169). In addition, there is a group of nineteen tools or tool-shaped artifacts (Bar-Adon 1980:98, 61 122, 61-123; pp. 112-115, 61-134 to 61-150). Of the six ivory objects (Bar-Adon 1980:16-23, 61-157 to 61-161, 61-188), five are made of large, flat, perforated hippopotamus tusks and one is a flat-based container, formed from a long segment of a hollow elephant tusk (identified by G. Haas 1980:16 and by F. Poplin of the Mu seum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris: Israel Museum 1990). In contrast to this relative typological uni formity, it is important to note the elements that combine to make each object unique. Within each group, the objects differ in size, shape, and the relative proportions of their components. As is evident from Table 2 (see below) they also differ in chemical composition and in the quality of their casting. In addition, the repertoire of decoration presents an almost infinite variety. This is due not so much to a large number of ornamental elements but rather to ingenuity, evi dent in the combination of these elements and in the perception of space, which changes from one object to another. With a few exceptions, the globular and disk-shaped maceheads are un decorated. The opposite is true of the maces: all but five are decorated. The decoration is basi cally linear and, as a rule, is confined to the shafts and the heads, leaving the necks and the flat disk-shaped rims plain. The principal deco rative elements are grooves, ridges, and incised lines which vary in length, depth, and direction; projecting elements, such as knobs and bosses, are less frequently applied. Objects bearing figurative—zoomorphic or anthropomorphic— elements are few and should be placed in a separate category of symbolism and excellence, reflecting their outstanding significance in use and value. The use and purpose of the objects in the hoard remain an enigma. It is widely believed, and it is assumed here, that the maces, 'crowns',</page><page sequence="3">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 97 standards, scepters, and the unusually shaped and decorated artifacts should be designated as 'ceremonial', 'prestige', or 'cultic' objects (but see Moorey 1988:184). Similarly, we assume that the maceheads were also ceremonial, in spite of their utilitarian form, as they are made of costly raw materials using a complex process of production; they would not willingly be endan gered in combat. Moreover, the ivory artifacts can hardly be explained as anything but luxuri ous and probably ceremonial. Even some of the tool-shaped objects could have been ceremonial rather then practical. The two socketed axes (Bar-Adon 1980:98, 61-122, 61-123) have rightly been included among the ceremonial objects, as should the axe blade with 'rope binding' (Bar Adon 1980:112, 61-134); the two adze blades (Bar-Adon 1980:113, 61-145 [see below, Cata logue, No. 27], 61-148) may be too thin and too long to have been used for actual work. It should be noted in this context that the heavy, socketed hammer (Bar-Adon 1980:115, 61-150) bears no marks of use (see below, Catalogue, No. 28) and that some tool blades (Bar-Adon 1980:113, 61 135, 61-136, 61-146) have blunt working edges; they may be unfinished artifacts, though the pos sibility that they were ingots should also be considered (see below, the Chalcolithic gold cir clets from the Nahal Qana cave). Environmental conditions must be considered when attempting to comprehend the nature of this unusual hoard. Bar-Adon (1980:2-13) re ports that the Cave of the Treasure (Cave No. 1) is one of three adjacent caves in the Nahal Mish mar canyon that were simultaneously inhabited and used. It is very large, with two consecutive halls (A and B), crevices, niches, and tunnels. The cave is situated on the north bank of Nahal Mishmar, 50 m below the top of the plateau, with a sheer drop of 250 m to the wadi bed. Still visible are the traces of a narrow trail that once led from the plateau to the entrance of the cave; today, the cave can be reached only with the help of rope ladders. The cave was inhabited in the Chalcolithic and Roman (Bar-Kokhba) periods. The Chal colithic occupation level contained numerous manifestations of daily life: hearths and uncar bonized remains of cultivated plants, cereals, and fauna; pottery vessels, sherds, and a typical Chalcolithic figurine of a sheep, made of un baked clay; basketry, textiles, and leather products; bone and wooden artifacts, and parts of a wooden loom. The cave also contained evi dence of burials: five skeletons were found in a crevice and in Hall B. But Bar-Adon assumed that the Cave of the Treasure was, principally, a habitation site, while the second and third caves served for burial. A large, oval enclosure was noted above the caves, on the plateau. Bar-Adon (1980:12-13) suggested that it was a Chal colithic open-air cult place. The Cave of the Treasure is not an isolated phenomenon in the occupational pattern of the Judean Desert. Chalcolithic remains are very often found in caves, which are a common geo logical formation in the desert. These caves are frequently situated where habitation would not be expected: in prohibitive gorges and on steep slopes that are difficult to reach and are removed from an immediate water source. Chalcolithic cave occupation in the Judean Desert was already noted by Neuville and Mallon (1931:29-49) during their pioneering survey and excavation of two caves. The pattern was confirmed by Aharoni (1961:14; 1962:190), by Bar-Adon (1980:203-204), and in more recent surveys and excavations (see also Govrin 1987:125-127, for cave dwellings in the north ern Negev). It has most recently been discussed by Perrot (1992:100-111), who republished the Neuville and Mallon material. The Nahal Hemar cave must also be mentioned here; containing an unusually rich and varied Pre-Pottery Neolithic B assemblage, it provides the earliest attestation of the phenomenon of 'treasure caves' (Bar Yosef 1985; Bar-Yosef and Alon 1988). Consequently, the Judean Desert cave-habita tion must be counted as a distinct phenomenon of the southern regions in the Chalcolithic pe riod. It coexisted with settlements across the Jordan River to the east and northeast, and the Negev settlements to the southwest. At least in part, this cave occupation was contemporary</page><page sequence="4">98 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. with the settlements of the two latter areas, prob ably in the later stages of their existence. Trade could be singled out as a posssible means of subsistence of these cave dwellers in this other wise forbidding region. The rich discoveries from the Nahal Qana cave, situated in the hill country of western Samaria, well north of the Judean desert and the Negev, are now the most significant addition to the Chalcolithic cave assemblages (Gopher and Tsuk 1991 :XXI-XXV). Alongside ossuary frag ments, basalt bowls, typical pottery vessels, and sherds, were found eight gold and electrum cir clets, weighing a total of nearly one kilogram (suggested by the excavators to be ingots; Go pher et al. 1990:436-443). Also found was a group of copper and ivory artifacts, as well as hematite maceheads, which present a direct comparison to the Nahal Mishmar hoard and which are the first occurrence of such objects in the central part of the country. Many of the copper, basalt, and ivory objects were broken and might have been retained as scrap intended for reuse or for the value of the raw material. Therefore, the possibility that they represent a trader's stock should be considered. The assignment of the Nahal Mishmar hoard to the Chalcolithic period was based not only on the considerations mentioned above, but also on its typological and stylistic affiliation with the long-known Ghassulian culture, with the then newly discovered Be'er Sheva culture, and also with the Golan Chalcolithic culture (Epstein 1977; 1978; 1982). Moreover, comparative studies of stylistic elements singled out the close artistic relationship between the hoard and other, local Chalcolithic assemblages leading to the conclu sion—now widely accepted—that the Nahal Mishmar hoard is not only Chalcolithic in date, but that it must have been of local production (Rosen 1986:25-27; Tadmor 1986:73; Moorey 1988:178; Beck 1989:47; for foreign compari sons see Elliott 1978:43^14; Moorey 1988:174; Beck 1989:42-45; Merhav 1993:24-42). Recent pétrographie analyses of cores from some mace heads corroborate this assumption. The toroidal core of a macehead from Shiqmim is made of a type of limestone found near 'En Yahav in the Arabah valley or near Ramat Matred in the west ern Negev (Goren 1989:149; Levy et al. 1991: 411). The cores differ in their composition, sug gesting the existence of several production centers. This conclusion posed a challenge to both his torians and archaeologists. First and foremost, the hoard presented unexpected and over whelming evidence for the existence of advanced metallurgy already in the Chalcolithic period— indeed, of a complete mastery of all processes of smelting, casting, molding, and finishing tech niques. What followed was a reassessment, often based on anthropological models, of this protohistoric culture in the south of modern Is rael, the unexpected find-spot of this early, advanced metallurgy in the ancient Near East (Levy 1986:5-20; Gilead 1988:397-443). To date, archaeological excavations have provided ample evidence of specialized Chalcolithic in dustries, resulting in an abundance of artifacts displaying technical and aesthetic excellence. Metallurgy is probably the most outstanding achievement of Chalcolithic technology, but certainly not the only one: ivory carving, stone cutting, bead making, flint knapping, and the potters' craft also display high levels of compe tence, which could only be the result of specialized training and professional tradition. Therefore, it must be assumed that Chalcolithic society was complex, one in which skilled craftsmen—and traders—formed an integral and significant part. But exposures of excavated areas and published data of finds are not yet sufficient for a detailed statistical approach such as spatial analysis, nor—consequently—for comprehensive conclusions on the role these craftsmen played in their society, i.e. whether they worked full- or part-time; the structure of their social organization—e.g. tribal, guild (?); and their status within the hierarchal structure. The hoard was first dated to late in the second part of the fourth millennium BCE. At present, following 14C calibrations as well as changing estimates as to the duration of the succeeding (Early Bronze I) period, the Nahal Mishmar</page><page sequence="5">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 99 Map 1. Geographical map of the Near East showing ore deposits (A) and archaeological sites (•) of relevance. hoard is dated earlier, not after 3500 BCE (Wein stein 1984:335; cf. Gilead 1988:401; Carmi and Segal 1992:131). Discoveries of similar objects in the Negev sites and in Judean Desert caves shed little light on the use of such objects or on the location of production sites (Map 1). Maceheads and ivory pieces are frequently found in the desert caves in comparable Chalcolithic assemblages, but never in such an accumulation as in the Cave of the Treasure (e.g. Aharoni 1961:14, Pis. 7, 8:A-C). The metal finds from Tell Abu Matar (Perrot 1955:79-80; 171-172, Pl. 15A; Gilead et al. 1991:175), Nevé Noy (Eldar and Baumgarten 1985:135, 137-138), and Shiqmim (Levy and Alon 1985:77, Fig. 4: 4, 6) are grouped in loci associated with metal working rather than with ceremony or ritual. At Palmahim (Gophna and Lifshitz 1980: PI. 1:5) a mace was deposited in a cave-tomb, together with pottery vessels and small sculptures, in what seems to have been an offering assemblage used in a funerary ritual. The excavators of the Nahal Qana cave sug gested that the copper objects, similar to the Nahal Mishmar hoard, were also tomb offerings (Gopher and Tsuk 1991 :XXXIII). The copper</page><page sequence="6">100 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. industry has become a pivotal issue in studies dealing with the structure of the Negev Chal colithic society and its economy (Levy and Alon 1982; Gilead 1988:418-443; Levy and Shalev 1989: 362-367; Rosen 1993). In an attempt to comprehend the very exist ence of the hoard and its puzzling location, it has been suggested that, originally, this vast treasure belonged to the Chalcolithic temple at 'En Gedi, and that it was removed and hidden in the desert cave at a time of danger (Ussishkin 1971:23-39; 1980:38-41). This hypothesis has lately been questioned, mainly because no finds similar to the hoard have been found in the temple. Moorey (1988:182) suggested that the hoard was originally housed in a major public build ing, not necessarily at 'En Gedi. Tadmor (1989: 252-253) and Gates (1992:135-137) proposed connecting the treasure with metal trade and re garding it as the possession of a tribe of traders or trader/smiths, the cave serving as a central repository. Recent pétrographie studies of pottery from the cave indicate that the 'En Gedi and Nahal Mishmar assemblages belong to different ceramic families and that the 'En Gedi group is not the most common among the Nahal Mishmar cave finds (Goren 1989:149 150; Gilead and Goren 1989:7). The Judean Desert hoard is unique in every respect, but none is more outstanding and puz zling than its metallurgical aspects: first, the very existence of hundreds of metal objects at such an early date and in an unexpected loca tion; and foremost, the outstanding capability of the ancient smiths, which finds an undisputed testimony in this superb assemblage. Following the discovery, one macehead and one axe blade were cut and metallographically analyzed by Potaszkin and Bar-Avi (1980:235 237); thirty objects were chemically analyzed by Key (1964:1578-1580; 1980:238-243). They suggested that the objects were produced by two distinct techniques—one of casting and the other of forging—and that the objects were made of two types of raw materials, almost pure copper for tools and arsenical copper for cere monial artifacts (see also Shalev 1991:413-424). Aspects of technology, elemental composi tion, and origins of metal became even more important with subsequent discoveries and fur ther studies. Exploitation of the Timna mines in the Chalcolithic period was suggested (Rothen berg 1962:57-60; 1978:1-51; Muhly 1984:285-287). Recent excavations in the ex tensive mining district at Feinan have brought a new dimension to the issue of local Chalcolithic mining and smelting (Hauptmann et al. 1985:163-195; Bochum, unpublished data). The discovery of metal objects, crucibles, ores, and some slags in the Negev sites and in the Arabah revealed an extensive copper industry utilizing local ores and prompted several metallurgical studies (Conrad and Rothenberg 1980; Hauptmann 1991:397-412; Hauptmann et al. 1992:1-33; Khalil 1988:117; Notis et al. 1984:240-242; Rothenberg 1978:1-23; Shalev and Northover 1987:357-371; 1993:1-13; Shalev 1991:413-424; Tylecote et al. 1974:32-34; Tylecote and Boydell 1978:27-49). Thus the need for renewed analyses of the Nahal Mishmar hoard became apparent in order to correlate this large corpus of objects with the growing body of local metal finds. The present report addresses itself to some of these issues. Approximately two hundred arti facts from the Nahal Mishmar hoard were previously examined radiographically; of these, twenty-eight objects were selected for the pre sent study. Non-destructive methods of thermal neutron and gamma radiography enabled the study of the interior structures of these objects on a larger scale than ever before. In addition, a detailed visual examination of each object revealed the techniques of surface treatment employed. Thorough elemental and neutron activation as well as lead isotope analyses provided exten sive information on the chemical composition of these objects, correcting earlier results. Conse quently, a renewed inquiry into the source of raw materials could be undertaken. Combined and in tegrated, these methods yielded hitherto unknown data on Chalcolithic technology, as exemplified in the production of these outstand ing artifacts.</page><page sequence="7">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 101 RADIOGRAPHY AND VISUAL EXAMINATION Methods of Radiography Non-destructive inspection methods of radiogra phy, now common in industry, were employed in the present study. In most cases the objects were inspected by gamma and thermal neutron radiation, which penetrated the thickness of the closed, three-dimensional forms, while X-rays were used only for thin-walled objects; each technique yielded different information on sub jects such as the structure, quality, molding, core remains, etc. of the items. Radiation penetrating an object interacts with the elements of the substance, and is sub sequently recorded on the area detector (e.g. film), thus providing information on the amount and nature of the material in the inspected ob ject. The result is a two-dimensional image, while the density of the film (gray levels) gives the desired data on the third dimension. Specifically, X-ray and gamma radiation in teract with the electrons of the elements in the inspected object. The probability of interaction is therefore higher for elements with more elec trons in their atom (higher Z) and higher density. Consequently, a cavity in the object will lead to less interactions and will be visible in the image by a larger amount of radiation reaching the film, i.e. by a dark spot. Any part of the object with lower density will also be shown by a darker area, as compared to an adjacent metallic part, which will be of a lighter shade. Thermal neutrons interact with the nuclei of the atoms of the material; for them the mass attenuation coefficient shows no systematic be havior. Rather, it is very selective, with hydrogen in particular having a much higher probability of interaction with thermal neutrons than materials of higher density, such as iron, copper, or lead. Hence any material containing hydrogen, e.g. most organic matters, will inter act strongly with the thermal neutrons and will cause a lower amount of radiation to reach the film, creating a lighter area in the image. In contrast, lead, which is a heavy, high-Z element, has a low probability of interaction with thermal neutrons, while having a very high probability of interaction with gamma or X-ray radiation. The comparison of radiographs of the same ob ject, obtained by the two complementary methods, permits the distinction between hy drogenous and high density materials, yielding maximum information. Catalogue The following twenty-eight objects were in spected by thermal neutron (henceforth TNR), gamma (GR), and X-ray radiation methods. In addition each object was examined with a x75 magnifying lens: 'Crowns': 61-170, 61-176. Maces with Ridged Heads: 61-52,61-53,61-83. Maces with Bosses: 61-67, 61-70, 61-81. Maceheads with Bosses: 61-105, 61-109. Maces with Knobs: 61-74, 61-77, 61-78. Mace with Disk-Shaped Head: 61-69. Short Maces with Disk-Shaped Heads: 61-97, 61-98,61-100. Disk-Shaped Maceheads: 61-126, 61-132. Globular, Squat Maceheads: 61-205,61-320,61-395. Elongated Maceheads: 61-253,61-297,61-391. Tools: 61-138, 61-145, 61-150. The plain, globular and elongated maceheads— those that are integrally incorporated with maces and those that form individual objects—fall into roughly four structural categories. However, it should be remembered that there is no rigidity in this classification and that considerable gradation, as well as variation, does exist within each type: Type A. Macehead with solid metal walls and a cylindrical shaft hole. Type B. Almost solid, thick-walled macehead with a slightly convex shaft hole. Type C. Thin-walled macehead, its cavity par tially or completely filled with core material. Type D. Macehead with a cylindrical shaft hole; preserved inside is a non-metallic toroi dal core, completely encased within the metal walls. Plain, disk-shaped maceheads fall into the fol lowing categories:</page><page sequence="8">102 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. Type E. Solid, disk-shaped head. Type F. Disk-shaped head cast over a core. 1. 'Crown', IAA 61-170, Fig. 1. Method of Inspection: X-rayed in its entirety at low energy for a prolonged period, using very low-grain film (SR 54), in order to obtain maxi mum resolution and enhance sensitivity, making it possible to observe the structure of the repairs, as well as the small defects. This method con veys the total thickness of the metal at each point of the object, according to the resolution of the radiographic system. Description: Open cylinder with splayed rims. Diam. 16.3 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: No 'seam' was detected that would in dicate the use of sheet metal or a segmented mold. We conclude, therefore, that the 'crown' was produced in a single casting. Defects: Casting defects appear in clusters above the two main gaps in the body of the 'crown', one large (Fig. la-c) and the other small (Fig. Id). The thickness of the 'crown' fluctuates in these areas, indicating that the de fects were caused during casting. Repairs: No evidence of soldering can be dis cerned, and both repairs appear to have been made by casting, followed by hammering. In places the edges of the repairs overlapped and covered the 'crown's surface; these edges were hammered and flattened to merge properly with the body of the 'crown'. The merging was more successful in the repair of the large gap. The metal of the repairs seems to be identical to that of the 'crown' (see below, Table 2), and the same tools were used in polishing, indicating that the repairs were carried out immediately after casting. Surface: Surface is finely polished, with clear traces of polishing. Elongation of defects along the rim provides clear evidence of rolling (Fig. Id). 2. 'Crown', IAA 61-176, Fig. 2. Method of Inspection: X-rayed in four sections. Description: Open cylinder, slightly splayed. Both rims flattened. Diam. 15.6 cm. Decoration: Wide, central register of grooved herringbone design, bordered on top and bottom by registers of six to seven horizontal grooves. The execution of the design is not precise. Three horn-like projections, as well as three stumps— probably the remains of broken-off, similar projections—are superimposed on the upper rim. Casting: Produced in a single casting. Defects: Very large casting defects concentrated in the central register. Repairs: The defects were mostly repaired, but small casting holes remained (Fig. 2a-c). Some of the repair metal is similar in color to the rest of the 'crown', while some is lighter. The repairs were cast. The following tech nique is suggested: Supports of an unknown material were held against the holes from the inside to control the flow of the metal, which was poured from the outside. Accurately fitting supports, closely held, resulted in a precise re pair, level with the 'crown's inner surface (Fig. 2a). Where the support was not properly affixed, lumps of metal protrude on the interior (Fig. 2b). Casting repairs were carried out when the 'crown' was under-heated; in some places, therefore, the fitting is not precise. On the exte rior, from where the metal was poured, the hole is usually completely covered, with metal spreading beyond the borders of the defect in some cases (Fig. 2c). This added extra mechani cal strength to the repair and held it in place. In all cases the external surface of the repair was initially raised and was subsequently worked; nevertheless, it is not level with the rest of the 'crown'. For this reason and because the poured metal often covered areas larger than the defect itself, the herringbone design was interrupted; the surface of the repair and the adjacent area were left undecorated (Fig. 2a-c). One repair was carried out in two stages: one part is precise and level with the interior surface, while the other bulges inside (Fig. 2b). A possi bility that additional defects were repaired but that the repairs fell off, though not very likely, must not be excluded. Surface: Many surface defects were left un mended, especially in the repaired areas. There</page><page sequence="9">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 103 are clear traces of rough polishing on the 'crown' and on the repairs, indicating that the repairs preceded the polishing. The surfaces of the three broken 'horns' are not polished. It is therefore likely that they were broken after the casting and polishing had been completed. 3. Mace, IAA 61-52, Fig. 3. Methods of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b). Description: Disk-shaped rim; plain neck; globular head (Type C); straight, hollow shaft; no splaying at lower end. L 28.9 cm. Decoration: Diagonal, somewhat curving ridges on head; shaft has a continuous design of irregu lar zigzag grooves, very sloppily executed. Casting: Single, very poor casting. The core was well centered in the neck, resulting in a wall of even thickness at cross sections, but it shifted slightly in the shaft (Fig. 3b). Diam. of core: 13 mm in shaft, 34 mm in head, but only 9 mm at rim. The core material has been almost com pletely removed from both ends, despite the narrowness of the shaft hole at the rim. There is a gap between the metal and the remaining core material in the head and shaft, which must have been caused by the shrinking of the core mate rial during cooling (Fig. 3a—note white line along outline of macehead). The core material is poorly seen by GR, but is discernible by TNR. This points to the prob ability that it contained elements that have high absorption or scattering for thermal neutrons, probably of low Z. In this respect, this mace differs from the other radiographed objects. In addition, TNR (Fig. 3a) shows the exist ence of an elongated object enclosed in the center of the core material, with a dark gap be tween the two elements. It is identified as a stick, which remained in the shaft, below the head: after having been inserted through the rim, it broke and was left inside. This could explain why the removal of the core material ended, leaving much of it inside the shaft. Defects: Extremely porous from rim to base. Large hole on shaft. Surface: Numerous defects. Traces of rough polishing. 4. Mace, IAA 61-53, Fig. 4. Methods of Inspection: GR. Description: Disk-shaped rim; short, plain neck; globular head (Type C); straight, hollow shaft; splayed base. L 17.0 cm. Decoration: Spiral ridges on head, some with well-defined profiles and others with blunt edges. There are two groups of three horizontal grooves each on the shaft and a grooved spiral of three rings above the base. Casting: Single, poor casting. The core material was not properly centered, resulting in a wall of uneven thickness. It may have been faulty in several places, collapsing during casting, thereby allowing metal to penetrate into the shaft hole and partly block it. Therefore, the core material remained in the center of the shaft hole, but was removed by a pointed tool (stick?) from the ends, as shown by marks on the inner sur face. Defects: Very porous, numerous defects pene trate the wall. A hole above the base, probably used to steady the core in the mold, was partly blocked during casting (Fig. 4a). Surface: Rough. Traces of polishing, mainly rough, and some fine. 5. Mace, IAA 61-83, Fig. 5. Method of Inspection: TNR. Description: Disk-shaped rim; short, plain neck, solid globular head (Type A); straight, hollow shaft; splayed base. Shaft hole wider at base than at rim (Fig. 5a). L 19.1 cm. Decoration: Irregular spiral ridges with sharp edges on the head. Two registers of design are on the shaft, separated by a horizontal ridge: zigzag grooves in the upper section and diagonal ridges in the lower. Both patterns are irregular, poorly executed. A horizontal ridge separates the head from the shaft. There is a horizontal groove above the base. Casting: Single, excellent casting. The shaft wall is of even thickness, with only a few flue tuations, pointing to a well-centered core. The core material has been almost completely re moved, except for one area along the shaft wall, below the head (Fig. 5a).</page><page sequence="10">104 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. Defects: No interior porosity. Surface: Silvery in color. Numerous surface de fects, caused by the rough surface of the mold. Clear traces of rough polishing, also in the grooves of the design, and of fine polishing on the surface. 6. Mace, IAA 61-67, Fig. 6. Methods of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b). Description: Structured as two superimposed maces. Upper mace with disk-shaped rim, long plain neck, globular head (Type C), and straight hollow shaft. Lower mace without rim and neck, but with elongated head (Type C), straight hollow shaft, and splayed base. Shaft hole wider at base than at rim (Fig. 6a). L 20.8 cm. Decoration: Upper mace has a plain neck, eight horizontal ridges on its head and a zigzag design of short irregular grooves on the shaft, bordered by a horizontal groove on each end. Lower mace has a plain head with four small bosses, evenly spaced; on the shaft, a zigzag design of shallow, irregular grooves; a horizontal groove lies above the base. All the design elements are poorly exe cuted, and the 'master' form was poorly prepared. Casting: Single, very poor casting. Defects of various size and marked porosity appear in the lower shaft wall, above the base (Fig. 6b), lead ing to the assumption that the mace was cast base up. The core material was completely re moved from the base and from the neck, but was removed unevenly from the rest of the mace, with much of it remaining, particularly in the upper shaft (Fig. 6b). As a result, the macehead could not be fully mounted on a shaft. Defects: See above, 'Casting'. Repairs: A hole at the junction of the lower head and upper shaft was filled with metal of a slightly different shade (of different composi tion?). The repair, cast while the mace was under-heated, left two to three pores; it is visible by both TNR (Fig. 6a) and GR (Fig. 6b). Surface: Traces of rough, and some fine, polish ing, but most of the surface remained matte. 7. Mace, IAA 61-70, Fig. 7. Method of Inspection: GR. Description: Short mace with disk-shaped rim; plain neck; elongated head (Type C); straight, hollow shaft with no splaying at lower end. Shaft hole wider at base than at rim. L 18.1 cm. Decoration: Two horizontal rows of evenly spaced bosses on the head—the upper row con tains five bosses; the lower one, four bosses; two horizontal grooves on the shaft. Casting: Single, good casting, with few, rather large defects in the upper part of the shaft and a concentration of small defects in the disk, rim, and head indicating that the mace was cast disk up (Fig. 7a). The shaft wall is of even thickness. The core material was left inside the head and was removed completely from the shaft. Defects: See above, 'Casting'. Surface: Small defects on the disk-shaped rim and head. Shallow, elongated defects appear at the lower end of the shaft; they could have been caused by an uneven mold surface or by rapid cooling. Indications of strokes with a sharp tool along the shaft. Beneath the horizontal grooves on the shaft are traces of strokes with a blunt tool. Traces of rough and fine polishing. 8. Mace, IAA 61-81, Fig. 8. Method of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b). Description: Disk-shaped rim; plain neck; only slightly protruding globular head (Type C); straight, hollow shaft; slightly splayed base with some excess metal at bottom, as if broken off. Shaft hole wider at base than at rim. L 20.6 cm. Decoration: Plain, except for six rounded and fairly evenly spaced bosses on the head. Casting: Single, excellent casting. The core was not properly centered, resulting in the varying thickness of the wall in cross sections above the base and especially in the neck, where Fig. 8b (taken at about 20o anti-clockwise to Fig. 8a) shows that one side is considerably thicker than the other. Excess metal at the base is the remnant of a spme and indicates that the mace was cast base up. Below the head and in several other places there is some excess metal inside the shaft (Fig. 8b—broken lines across width of shaft), evi dence that the core had cracks into which metal flowed during casting. Side by side, at 18-20 mm</page><page sequence="11">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 105 above the base, are two holes in the shaft wall, one irregular, the other round. It is likely that the latter served to steady the core in the mold. The core material was completely removed from both ends of the mace, but only partially from the shaft, leaving the shaft hole narrow, uneven, and crooked. The cleaning of the core material from the shaft was probably carried out with the pointed stick which was found inside the mace (cf. Bar-Adon 1980:83, No. 107). Defects: No interior porosity. Surface: Defects in the disk-shaped rim and base. Traces of rough and fine polishing except for the base, where only the surfaces of the surplus metal are polished. 9. Macehead, IAA 61-105, Fig. 9. Methods of Inspection: TNR. Description: Truncated cone shape, tapering to ward the rim at one end (the top?), asymmetrical in section (Fig. 9a). Shaft hole slightly tapering at both ends. L 8.5 cm. Decoration: Entire surface covered with irregu lar rows of small, rounded bosses. Casting: Single, excellent casting. Defects: No interior defects. Surface: Irregular, only partially polished, possi bly because of irregularity of decoration. In addition, there are spots of surplus metal on the surface between some bosses. They must have been caused by a faulty mold which cracked, allowing metal to pour into the cracks, making surface treatment even more difficult. 10. Macehead, IAA 61-109, Fig. 10. Methods of Inspection: TNR. Description: Barrel-shaped, widening at one end (top?), asymmetrical in section. Shaft hole is elliptical at its base, and almost round at the top (Fig. 10a). L 8.0 cm. Decoration: Entire surface covered with regular rows of almost identical bosses, each shaped like a four-sided pyramid. Casting: Single, good casting. Defects: A few scattered pores. Surface: Clear, deep traces of polishing, which also shaped the bosses. These are visible be tween the rows of bosses, between the bosses themselves, and on its surface and both rims. 11. Mace, IAA 61-74, Fig. 11. Method of Inspection: GR. Description: Disk-shaped rim; short, plain neck, solidly cast globular head (Type A); straight, hollow shaft; splayed base. Shaft hole narrows conically at neck and is pronouncedly narrower at rim than at base (Fig. 1 la). L 18.5 cm. Decoration: Regular, precisely executed design. On the head are four large, evenly spaced knobs with splayed surfaces. On each end of the shaft is a register of short zigzag grooves: the top register is bordered by pairs of horizontal grooves; the bottom register has a double-grooved top border only. Two pairs of horizontal grooves appear in the middle of the shaft. Casting: Single, excellent casting. The shaft wall is of fairly even thickness, except for a few concavities on the lower part of the shaft, caused by the uneven surface of the core. The core material was completely removed from the shaft, while some was left in the head (Fig. 1 la). Defects: Very few, small, sporadic pores. Surface: Small defects. Vertical and spherical traces of rough and fine polishing in the grooves of the design, where there are also some rem nants of the mold material. 12. Mace, IAA 61-77, Fig. 12. Method of Inspection: GR. Description: Disk-shaped rim; plain neck; globular head (Type C), straight, hollow shaft; no splaying at lower end. L 21 cm. Decoration: The mace is plain, except for two horizontal rows of four evenly spaced knobs, one row on the head and the other on the shaft. The knobs are fairly similar in size and have elongated necks and double heads. One of the knobs on the shaft is broken off at its base. Casting: Single, excellent casting, wall of even thickness in the shaft, head, and neck, indicating that the core was very well centered in the mold (Fig. 12a). Sharp profiles of the rim's disk and knobs demonstrate the high sculptural quality of</page><page sequence="12">106 M. Tadmor. F. Begemann et al. the initial form, as well as the high fluidity of the molten metal in casting. Some excess metal at the junction of the head and neck (Fig. 12a) is the result of a very narrow crack in the core material; this is additional proof of the extremely high fluidity of the metal in casting (cf. No. 8, where similar penetration of metal into cracks has been observed and where the quality of casting is also very good). The core material remained in the head. It was completely removed from the neck and lower shaft (up to 3 cm above the base), while rem nants were left in the rest of the shaft. Defects: No interior defects. Surface: The outer surface is slightly wavy, re fleeting the surface quality of the mold; the inner surface is unusually smooth, demonstrating the core's smooth surface. Traces of rough and fine polishing. The surface of the broken knob was left rough, without polishing; we may therefore assume that the break occurred after casting and polishing had been completed. 13. Mace, IAA 61-78, Fig. 13. Method of Inspection: GR. Description: Regularly shaped disk rim; long, plain neck; globular macehead (Type C); straight, hollow shaft; splayed, somewhat asym metrical base. Shaft hole wider at base than at rim. L 26.1 cm. Decoration: The shaft is completely covered with zigzag groups of short grooves, forming a continuous interwoven design, very finely exe cuted. On the top and bottom of the otherwise plain head are two horizontal rows of double headed knobs, each row consisting of four evenly spaced knobs. In the lower row, at the junction of the shaft and the head, only one knob is complete while three are broken at their bases. In the upper row, at the top of the head, one knob is complete, one is broken at its base, and two have their heads broken off. There is some dam age on the disk rim. Casting: Single, excellent casting, almost with out defects. The mace was cast base up. On the base are two areas of surplus metal—remnants of sprues—which were almost, but not entirely, levelled. The core material was completely re moved from the shaft, while most of it remained inside the cavity of the thin-walled macehead. In the neck, the shaft wall is of even thickness at cross sections, tapering toward the rim. Despite the shaft's length, the metal wall is very thin. Its thickness varies somewhat, due to the uneven, slightly wavy contours of the core (see Fig. 13a). Defects: Very few pores. Surface: Silvery in color, with some defects and one shallow external crack on the surface of the shaft, below the head. There are clear traces of rough and some fine polishing. In spite of an attempt to remove all traces of the mold mate rial, leaving grooves on the surface, some remnants can still be seen. Of the three broken knobs at the junction of the head and shaft, one break is polished; the other two are unpolished. The surfaces in the upper row and the broken disk rim are not polished. 14. Mace, IAA 61-69, Fig. 14. Methods of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b, c). Description: Disk-shaped rim; short neck; sol idly cast disk-shaped head (Type E) and a smaller disk lower on shaft; straight, hollow shaft; slightly damaged splayed base. Shaft hole wider at base than at rim. L 20.5 cm. Decoration: The neck and shaft down to the lower disk are plain. Below that, the shaft has a ridged design of five evenly spaced spirals be ginning above the base. The disks and spirals have well-defined profiles and sharp edges. Casting: Single, excellent casting. The shaft hole is straight and even in thickness at cross sections, narrowing toward the neck; the inner wall is smooth and even, indicating a well-pre pared core (Fig. 14a, b). The core material was completely removed. Defects: Two to three pores in shaft, neck, and large disk (Fig. 14b and c, taken at 90o to b). Surface: Light in color; sporadic, small defects. Clear traces of rough polishing and some fine polishing. 15. Mace, IAA 61-97, Fig. 15.

Both ends of shaft are straight, without disk shaped rim or splayed lower end. L 8.8 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: Single, excellent casting. The shaft wall is of even thickness, indicating that the core was very well centered in the mold (Fig. 15b). The disk edge is blunt (Fig. 15a, b). Defects: No interior defects. Surface: Smooth, except for few, rather large defects on disk (Fig. 15c). Deep, spherical traces of polishing at the junction between the disk and the shaft, mainly on the disk's underside. No other traces of polishing are discernible. 16. Mace, IAA 61-98, Fig. 16. Methods of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b).

The disk is not symmetrical in relation to the shaft (Fig. 16b). L 9.3 cm. Decoration'. None. Casting: Single, excellent casting. The shaft wall is of uneven thickness (Fig. 16a, b), indicat ing that the core was not properly centered in the mold. Defects: No interior defects. Surface: A few, rather large, defects. Traces of rough and fine polishing. 17. Mace, IAA 61-100, Fig. 17. Methods of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b-d). Description: Short mace with disk-shaped rim, long neck, and disk-shaped head (Type F); straight, hollow shaft; no splaying at lower end. Disk is not completely symmetrical; shaft is not completely straight. L 10.8 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: Single, good casting. Rim and disk edges are well defined (Fig. 17a, c). This is the only one among the radiographed disk-shaped heads which is not solid, but was cast over a core (Fig. 17a, c, d). GR (Fig. 17d), taken with the rim perpendicular to Fig. 17a-c, shows that the core material, left in the disk's cavity, has a well-defined edge, but is not completely sym metrical and does not form a regular circle (Fig. 17d—white, circular area). Defects: No internal defects except for three small pores in disk head and a hole in shaft (Fig. 17b-c). Repair. Large, very well executed repair of the hole in the lower section of the shaft. The repair was carried out by casting, possibly after partial removal of the core material through the hole. The molten metal covered the original surface of the shaft on both sides. On the outside it was carefully worked, completely obliterating the re pair and leaving the surface smooth, as if an integral part of the shaft wall; the repaired sur face was left bulging inside the shaft. GR (Fig. 17b) shows the overlap of the repair material on the original surfaces. Surface: Rough, indicating that the mold had a rough surface. Some clear grooves were left by attempts to polish the entire surface. 18. Macehead, IAA 61-126, Fig. 18. Method of Inspection: GR. Description: Disk-shaped (Type E), with convex surfaces. Shaft-hole rims regular in shape with sharp edges. Diam. 6.6 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: Single, good casting. Defects: A few small pores and one large inte rior defect, which penetrates the surface. Repair: The defect was repaired by casting in two stages: metal was first poured into the deep part of the defect, and then into the remaining, shallow hole. Both stages are discernible radio graphically and with the naked eye (Fig. 18). The color of the metal used in the repair is iden tical with the rest of the macehead; it can, therefore, be assumed that the repair was carried out immediately after casting, with metal of the same composition. Surface: Casting defect remains on the surface. Fine polishing almost obliterated all traces of rough polishing. 19. Macehead, IAA 61-132, Fig. 19. Method of Inspection: GR.</page><page sequence="14">108 M. Tadmor. F. Begemann et al. Description: Disk-shaped, with a sharp-edged disk (Type E). Shaft is very short with one rim flat (lower?), the other sharp (upper?). Diam 5.9 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: Single, poor casting. Defects: Porous; each pore is only a few milli meters in diameter (Fig. 19a). Surface: Dark colored metal. Numerous defects, fairly deep traces of polishing. 20. Macehead, IAA 61-205, Fig. 20. Method of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b, c). Description: Globular, squat (Type D), contain ing a toroidal core, completely encased in metal; fairly thick metal walls. Shaft hole narrows to ward top rim, which is somewhat oval in shape. Bottom rim is flattened. L 4.1 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: Single, good casting. A concentration of small pores, mainly in the lower, narrow part. A large pore in that area spreads from the center and penetrates through the shaft wall, near the lower rim (Fig. 20a, c). These defects indicate the macehead was cast with its narrow part up. One support hole, between the core and the toroid, is located slightly below the line of maxi mum diameter (Fig. 20b). Defects: See above, 'Casting'. Surface: Signs of hammering and a few promi nent defects, especially at the bottom rim. Few traces of rough polishing; thorough fine polishing. 21. Macehead, IAA 61-320, Fig. 21. Method of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b). Description: Globular, squat (Type C). Shaft hole is fairly straight, widening slightly at both ends. L 4.4 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: Single, good casting; five to six large round pores, mainly in the upper part, as well as sporadic minute ones, indicating the macehead was cast upright (Fig. 21a). Core material, which remained in the large, rectangular interior cavity, leaving the shaft hole straight, has rounded corners (Fig. 21b); it was completely removed from the shaft hole. Defects: See above, 'Casting'. Surface: Defects of various sizes. Clear traces of rough polishing in all directions, then finely pol ished. Dark shade of metal. 22. Macehead, IAA 61-395, Fig. 22. Methods of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b). Description: Globular, squat, solid body (Type B). L 4.3 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: Single, poor casting. Some core mate rial was left in the cavity of the shaft wall, in the center. Defects: Strewn with small pores (Fig. 22a, b). Surface: Numerous defects. The surface was treated by hammering, leaving a very thin sur face layer and, beneath it, a layer of flattened pores (Fig. 22a). Some traces of fine polishing remain, but none of rough polishing. 23. Macehead, IAA 61-253, Fig. 23. Methods of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b). Description: Elongated, solid body, with metal wall thicker in lower, narrow part (Type B). Shaft hole is wider at base than at rim. Core material was removed from the shaft hole, but remained in the cavity, leaving the shaft hole straight. Bottom rim is slightly flattened, and mostly horizontal. L 5.7 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: Single, excellent casting. In the widest area, TNR (Fig. 23a) shows a triangular hollow in the metal body of the macehead, the head of the triangle pointing outward. GR (Fig. 23b; taken at a 90o angle to Fig. 23a) demonstrates the hollow is conical. It penetrates the thickness of the metal and reaches the surface, like a surface defect; it does not penetrate the core material. We therefore conclude that the mold support (of wood, which burned out?) was located here; it touched the core but did not penetrate inside. Defects: No interior defects. Surface: Very few defects, bright color, highly polished. No traces of rough or fine polishing. 24. Macehead, IAA 61-297, Fig. 24. Methods of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b). Description: Elongated, biconical, solid body (Type B). Maximum diameter near top. Bottom</page><page sequence="15">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 109 rim is flattened, horizontal, and irregular in shape. Metal wall, thick in upper part, is thin and irregular at narrow, lower part (Fig. 24b). L 5.3 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: Single, good casting. Areas of porosity, mainly in the lower part, indicate that the mace was cast with this part up (Fig. 24a, b). The shaft wall is very rough and irregular, reflecting the surface of the core. All the core material was removed, except for some left in the cavity (Fig. 24b). Defects: See above, 'Casting5. Surface: Some sporadic defects; traces of rough and some fine polishing. In some sections, espe daily at the widest diameter, there are traces of hammering, perhaps intended to enhance the bi conical shape and obliterate surface defects. There are numerous defects on the bottom rim. 25. Macehead, IAA 61-391, Fig. 25. Methods of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b, c). Description: Elongated and slender, solid body (Type A). Shaft hole is wider at bottom than at rim. Bottom rim has been flattened and is mostly horizontal, c. 1 mm wide. L 5.5 cm. Decoration: None. Casting: Single casting. Good in outer section, but surprisingly poor inside macehead (Fig. 25a-c). TNR (Fig. 25a) and GR (Fig. 25b, c), taken at a 90" angle to each other, show the existence of an interior defect in the center of the upper part of the macehead, from which chan nels of trapped gas spread out and toward the lower, narrow part of the macehead, indicating the macehead was cast with the latter up. Defects: See above, 'Casting5. Surface: Some defects of varying depth. Surface is highly polished, with slight polishing grooves. 26. Axe blade, IAA 61-138, Fig. 26. Method of Inspection: TNR. Description: One side flat, the other slightly convex, tapering toward the sharp working edge. L 15.3 cm. Casting: Solid casting, good (Fig. 26a). The two surfaces differ, indicating that the axe may have been cast in an open mold. Surface: Traces of hammering only on the work ing edge; no traces of hammering or polishing on the surfaces. It seems therefore that, except for the working edge, the axe was left as cast. Analyzed by Potaszkin and Bar-Avi (1980: 235, where it is mistakenly listed as 61-137). 27. Adze blade, IAA 61-145, Fig. 27. Methods of Inspection: TNR (a), GR (b). Description: Long, thin blade, widening toward sharp working edge, which is rounded and splayed. L 25.3 cm. Casting: Solid casting, excellent; only two very small pores, one above the other, could be dis cerned on the working edge (Fig. 27a). They are compressed widthwise, indicating hammering. Defects: See above, 'Casting'. Surface: Numerous defects (Fig. 27b). In addi tion, many round concavities are visible to the naked eye; they are the result of hammering. The working edge was flattened by hammering and polished widthwise; there are no signs of polishing on the surface. 28. Hammer, IAA 61-150, Fig. 28. Methods of Inspection: GR. Description: Socketed; oval, one face flat, the other convex, tapering toward the working edge. Shaft hole is slightly off center. L 13.0 cm. Casting: Lost wax, very poor casting; cast in a closed mold over an irregularly shaped core. Numerous pores of varying size, some large (Fig. 28a). They are round and regular in shape, indicating that the object was not forged by hammering after casting. The pores are elon gated only along the edges (Fig. 28a), providing evidence of hammering there. Defects: See above, 'Casting'. Surface: Strewn with defects, especially the con vex (upper) surface, while the flat (lower) surface is of better quality. There is no evidence that these surfaces were in any way treated by hammering or polishing, nor is there any indication that the hammer was used on a hard surface, as such wear would have left its marks. It seems therefore that the hammer is in pristine condition.</page><page sequence="16">110 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al.

Discussion Casting All maces and maceheads were produced by the lost-wax investment casting method. X-ray radi ography of both 'crowns' (Nos. 1, 2)* verified that they were also produced using the same technique. The 'crowns' are in the shape of large, open cylinders with splayed rims. Along the rim of 'Crown' No. 1, there are clear traces of rolling, suggesting that the crown was cast as a straight-sided cylinder and that the splayed rims were shaped after the casting had been completed. The hammer (No. 28) was also cast in the lost-wax method. In the group under study here, only the blades of the axe (No. 26) and the adze (No. 27) are solid casts. All the objects were cast in their entirety in a single casting, with all the structural and orna mental elements included in the mold. As no two objects are identical, each must have been cast in an individual mold. No 'seams' were detected by radiography in any of the inspected objects, indicating that closed molds were used in cast ing (see Catalogue, No. 1). Consequently, each mold had to be broken after casting to retrieve the newly made product. Clear exceptions are the axe blade (No. 26) and possibly also the adze blade (No. 27), which seem to have been cast in an open mold. Radiography showed that, within each type, the objects vary greatly in their interior struc tures. This variety is especially striking in the undecorated globular and elongated maceheads which, externally, seem so similar to each other. Radiography also revealed a wide range in the success of casting. Some maces were very poorly cast, resulting in various degrees of po rosity in the metal wall. At one end of the range are Maces 3 and 4, in which great porosity was observed along the entire length of the wall; at the other end are excellently cast maces, with few or no pores in their metal walls (Nos. 8, 9, 11-16). The maces with disk-shaped heads are mostly well cast, except for No. 19, which is poorly cast and strewn with small pores, and Nos. 17 and 18, in which some defects can be seen, although they are also well cast. The two maceheads of complex design (Nos. 9, 10) are well cast. The globular and elongated maceheads display various degrees of success in their casting, from very poor to excellent ( see Table 2). The marked differences in the success of cast ing and in the interior structures, when added to the variations in shape, size, and design within each artifact type, suggest that the objects were produced by various hands, possibly in different workshops (cf. Goren 1989:149); it may also be suggested that they were produced over a pe riod of time. This does not conflict with the fact that they all belong to a common cultural tradition. It should be noted that similar stylis tic variations are typical of other Chalcolithic artifact groups, e.g. ossuaries and ivoiy figurines. The six globular maceheads investigated here represent all types, including the toroid Type D (No. 20). All globular and elongated maceheads that are incorporated in maces be long to Type C, except for Nos. 5 and 11, which are the only two with solid walls (Type A). As a rule, disk-shaped maceheads have solid metal walls, the only exception being No. 17, in which the disk was cast over a core. Concentration of porosity in certain areas— near the base or toward the rim—sheds light on the position of the object while being cast. Thus, Maces 6 and 13 were cast with their bases up, as the porosity is greatest there. Mace 7 was cast with the disk-rim up, where a concentration of defects occurs. Maceheads 20, 24, and 25 were cast with their lower, narrow parts up, while No. 21 was probably cast in an upright position. The position of some maces during the casting process may be deduced from yet another element. Spots of excess metal were observed on the bases of Maces 8 and 13. These may well be the remnants of sprues which could not be entirely levelled by sur face treatment (see below, p. 128). Thus, the metal would have been poured from the base through the sprues during casting, indicating that they were cast base up. * Numbers throughout refer to this Catalogue. IAA numbers refer to artifacts in Bar-Adon 1980 (see also Table 1).</page><page sequence="31">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 125 Cores The rough, inner surfaces of the shaft walls indi cate that hardly any care was invested in the smoothing of the surfaces of the ceramic cores or in the precision of their shape. Only in one case (No. 14) was the inner surface of the shaft wall smooth, indicating the fine quality of the core surface. The irregular shape of the core is reflected in the outline of the shaft wall (Nos. 13, 24); in extreme cases it created slight interior concavities (No. 11). In many cases the core was cracked and metal penetrated into the cracks, partially blocking the shaft hole. This is attested in Mace 4, which is poorly cast, and in Nos. 8 and 12, which are very well cast. In most cases, the cracks were very thin—the metal must have been very fluid to have penetrated into such minute spaces. The smiths obtained the neces sary fluidity by using an enriched antimony arsenic copper alloy. The cause of these cracks is still undetermined, although two possibilities may be suggested: they could have been caused by the tension introduced in the mold after fir ing; or by thermal shock, engendered by pouring hot alloy into the mold, which had not been previously heated, either fully or partially. The shaft hole narrows toward the top in a number of maces, reflecting the conical shape of the core, which was wider at the base (Nos. 3, 5-8, 11, 13-14). This phenomenon is also very common in the maceheads (Nos. 20, 23, 25). In Mace 3, the shaft hole, now blocked, is pro nouncedly narrower at the rim than at the base. The frequency of this phenomenon indicates that the conical shape was intentional. It may have been designed to prevent the maces and maceheads from slipping when mounted on a wooden shaft (remains of such shafts were actu ally found inside the shaft holes of some maces [e.g. Bar-Adon 1980: 69, 61-82; p. 70, 61-17]). The complete removal of the core material from the shaft holes of the maces was often far from successful. The core was completely re moved in Maces 7,11, 13, and 14. In Nos. 8 and 12 it was extracted in its entirety from both ends, but its remnants were left along the length of the shaft wall. In Nos. 6 and 8 the ends were cleaned of core material, while the rest was removed unevenly, leaving a narrow, twisted, and uneven shaft hole. In Nos. 3 and 4 the shaft hole is blocked for much of its length; the core was removed at both ends. The last three maces could not have been mounted on a shaft. Maces 3 and 4 demonstrate that various acci dents prevented the complete removal of the core material. In No. 4 the penetration of metal into the cracks of the core blocked the shaft. It is likely that a technical accident prevented the complete removal of the core in No. 3: thermal neutron radiography shows that a hollow stick is preserved inside the core material. We assume that this stick, which was inserted from the head of the mace, was used to extract the core mate rial from the shaft. It broke while in use and remained inside the core. A similar accident was attested in Mace 61-56 (Bar-Adon 1980:73; not included in the present selection), where thermal neutron radiography showed a stick that broke and was left inside the core material. Another stick, which was found in Mace 8 (Bar-Adon 1980:83, 61-81), may serve as an example of such a cleaning tool: it is narrow and must have been flexible, to facilitate penetration, and it is pointed to split the core material. In some cases, the stick is not preserved, but the sur face of the remaining core material has wear marks from a pointed tool (No. 4). There are usually remnants of the core mate rial in the innermost sections of Type C maceheads. It seems that even a flexible tool could not reach the depth of these cavities. Mold Structure In the majority of objects, no trace of the means by which the core was securely held in place within the mold was found. Therefore, the mold must have been constructed in such a way that whatever devices were employed, they were external to the confines of the actual object. The suggested structure of the mold is presented below. The ceramic core was formed in its entirety. Its shaft and neck were longer than the object intended for casting, so that the projecting ends could be fastened to the mold, leaving no traces</page><page sequence="32">126 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. on the object itself. The core was then fired. In the next stage, the core was covered with a ma terial suitable for the lost wax casting method—beeswax, tree resin, or, perhaps, bitu men or some bitumenous compound. This material was carved into the desired shape, in eluding all the surface elements with their details. The structure was then covered with an outer ceramic mold. In many cases, when the core was well centered, the shaft wall is of even thickness at its cross sections (Maces 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15). In others (Maces 3,4, 8, 13, 16), the uneven thickness of the wall indicates that the core was irregular in shape, positioned off cen ter, or moved slightly during the casting process. We assume that at least the clay layer of the mold which came into contact with the sculp tured wax was uniform and fine enough in composition to exactly duplicate the carved de sign. Sprues for pouring the metal in and letting the gases out were constructed at one end (at the base ends in Maces 8 and 13). The whole con struction was fired, and the wax melted and/or evaporated. Molten metal was then poured into the mold. At the end of the whole process, the metal solidified, the mold was broken, the core was removed as far as possible, and the process of surface treatment was begun. A support hole, observed inside Macehead 20, confirms the use of interior supports in the com plex toroidal Type D maceheads, in which it was necessary to hold the core and the toroid to gether during casting. This technique was already observed and described by Potaszkin and Bar-Avi (1980:235), who sectioned one of the Nahal Mishmar maceheads, which had a ce ramie toroid. A similarly constructed macehead from Shiqmim contained a toroidal core made not of ceramic but of limestone (Goren 1989:149; Levy et al. 1991:411; see above, p. 98). Surprisingly, a support hole connecting the mold to the core was disclosed by radiography in Macehead 23 (Type B), in which the metal wall is solid, constructed without a toroid. This presents a type of mold structure . It should be remarked that here, as in the two previously mentioned maceheads, only one support was used, leaving the possibility of slight movement of the core during casting. In addition to the maceheads, support holes were observed in Maces 4 and 8, as well as in several other maces which were radiographed, but are not included in the present selection. It seems, therefore, that the method of connecting the core to the mold by means of a support was not confined to the toroidal maceheads only, but that—at least in some cases—it was also used in other types of maceheads and in some maces as well. In the latter, the support holes are placed above the base, on one side of the shaft wall; as in the maceheads, only one support was used in con necting the core to the mold. Design As pointed out above, each object in our selec tion—and in the hoard in general—is different in shape, size, and design. The variety in decora tion is best exemplified in maces. The designs are primarily based on endless combinations of grooves and ridges grouped in horizontal, verti cal, and diagonal arrangements. Bosses and knobs are added in a distinct group of maces and in unusually shaped maceheads. Short maces with disk-heads, disk-shaped maceheads, as well as all globular and elongated maceheads, are plain. Marked diversity is also observed in the exe cution of the design. The differences are due to variations in the skill of the mold-maker and/or caster in producing the original forms, aug mented by poor casting. Thus in Mace 3, the zigzag grooves are irregular in shape and direc tion and are also very poorly executed; in Mace 4, the degree of precision varies; in Maces 5 and 6, the design is inexact and it is carelessly— almost incompetently—grooved (though in the former the four bosses are evenly spaced on the lower macehead). At the other end of precision are Maces 11-13 and especially Mace 14: the components of the design—grooves, ridges, bosses, and knobs, as well as the disks of No. 14—are all precisely prepared and evenly spaced, with well-defined profiles and sharp edges. Worth mentioning is the precision</page><page sequence="33">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 127 achieved in dividing the circular surfaces of the maces and the ability to space the knobs and bosses at even intervals. The maces in this group were also very well cast. But the correlation between poor casting/poor design and good casting/good design may not be as close as it may seem from the latter objects. Mace 5 is one example of poor design and excel lent casting. In the large group of maces we radiographed, but did not include in the present selection, there were several cases of complex, well-prepared design and poor casting (e.g. 61-19, 61-28, 61-73). The most noteworthy ex ample is the famous 'Ibex Scepter' (Bar-Adon 1980:42-45, 61-88), in which the complex and beautifully balanced design and excellent sur face treatment stand in striking contrast to its extreme internal porosity. Defects and Repairs Defects stemming from a variety of reasons have been observed. Casting defects are by far the most numerous. Interior defects of porosity, which were disclosed by radiography, and holes of various sizes were often observed in all types of objects. In all cases, the defects were repaired by casting. No evidence that other methods, e.g. soldering, were employed in the repair of de fects was found in the items under study. As mentioned above, the most numerous de fects and repairs occur in both 'crowns'. Indeed, it seems that the formidable task of casting these large cylinders resulted in uneven thickness of the wall and in numerous large and small holes. Casting techniques employed in the repair of these holes, as well as surface treatment follow ing the repairs, are discussed below and in the description of both 'crowns' in the catalogue. Defects occur also in maces and in mace heads. Inner defects, stemming from faulty cores and resulting in the leakage of metal into the shaft holes, were already discussed above, as was the fact that no attempt was made to repair these defects even when they prevented, par tially or completely, the removal of the core material from the shaft. In some cases, these were defects stemming from faulty molds ob served on the surfaces of these objects. Such defects (Nos. 7 and 9) could successfully be obliterated by polishing. Still, in many cases, surface defects remained unrepaired, and they are clearly visible. Repairs of casting defects were detected in Maces 6 and 17 and in Macehead 18; they are discussed in the catalogue. In most cases the metal used in these repairs is similar or identical in color to that of the object itself, leading to the conclusion that the repairs were executed imme diately following casting (Nos. 1, 2, 17 [see above], 18). Imperfect fitting of the repair with the body of the object indicates that the object was under-heated during casting (Nos. 1, 2, 6). Traces of subsequent polishing on the repair patches and on the original surfaces adjacent to them indicate that the production sequence was casting-repairs-polishing (Nos. 1, 2, 17), the last two processes immediately following the first (see below, p. 133 and Table 2). In all types of objects, with the exception of maces, there are instances in which the surfaces were hammered. The most common reason for hammering was the need to eliminate surface defects. In most cases the object treated by hammering was porous, with the pores just beneath the surface or opening onto it. Ham mering flattened the metal and closed the pores. At the same time, it also flattened and elongated the closed pores beneath the sur face; these can still be seen in the radiographs. On the whole, attempts to obliterate defects by hammering and flattening the repaired sur faces were more successful in maceheads than in 'crowns'. A phenomenon, which remains incomprehen sive to our modern dictates of aesthetics, must be noted—in both 'crowns' and in some maces, certain holes were repaired, while others re mained untouched, affecting the appearance of the entire object. It could be that additional defects were repaired and that the repair fell off, but—even if this happened in some cases—it does not explain the seeming negligence, for which, especially in the 'crowns', we can find no satisfactory explanation.</page><page sequence="34">128 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. Surface The treatment of the surface was an integral part in the production process of all the artifacts. It was essential in obliterating casting defects, shap ing ornamental elements, and smoothing and polishing the surface. The exterior surfaces of all the radiographed objects were polished after casting. Therefore only in a few cases could we detect any surplus metal or mold material, which remained on the surface in the grooves of the design (Macehead 9 and Mace 11). As a rule, the surface was first polished roughly, then finely. Traces of rough polishing can be found on most objects; they may be horizontal or vertical and occasionally circular. The traces are especially clear in places which were difficult to reach, such as the junc tion between the disk or base and the shaft (Mace 15) and around projecting knobs and bosses (Macehead 10); in some cases, they can also be distinguished in the grooves of the design (Mace 11). Complex and dense design made polishing difficult or even impossible (Maceheads 9, 10). Occasionally, the surface is so highly polished that the traces of polishing have been almost entirely obliterated (Maceheads 23, 25). In Maceheads 20 and 22 and in the bi-conical macehead (No. 24), the surface was also ham mered (see above, p. 108); traces of strokes with sharp or blunt tools are discernible on the sur face of Mace 7. It seems that the smiths had no filing instruments and that they could use only sharp, thin-edged tools made of hard stone (e.g. flint or occasionally obsidian), which are well attested in the Chalcolithic period. This may explain why the excess metal, such as stumps of sprues, could not be removed after casting, and why hammering was often used to effect repairs. Interestingly, the inner surfaces of the 'crowns' were left rough, while the outer surfaces were polished, roughly and finely, similarly to those of the maces and the maceheads. This difference may indicate that, in use, the interiors of the 'crowns' were not intended to be seen; other wise such a contrast cannot be explained in this category of outstanding objects, some of which are among the most ornate components of the hoard. It is common to find traces of polishing not only on the original surfaces of objects but also on the repair patches. Therefore, the fact that the surfaces of the three stumps on the rim of Crown 2 and of some maces (see above) were unpolished raises the probability that the 'horns' were broken after the entire production process had been completed. A possibility that they broke in use should not be excluded. Tools The three objects differ in their shape, method, and success of casting, as well as in surface treatment. The hammer (No. 28) was cast over a core by the lost-wax method, and the very poor results could be related to the use of an under heated mold while casting. The blades of the axe and the adze (Nos. 26, 27) are solid casts (for No. 26 see below, SEM analysis). The axe blade was probably cast in an open mold, with good results (v.v. Potaszkin and Bar-Avi 1980:237). Because of extensive hammering, there is now no indication what type of mold was used in the casting of the adze blade (No. 27), although it may be suggested that it was cast horizontally in an open, shallow mold of proportions similar to the finished product, with excellent results. Our observations do not support earlier conclusions that these tools were forged into shape and that native copper was used (Potaszkin and Bar-Avi 1980:235; Key 1980:240). Examination shows that the three objects also differ in the treatment of their surfaces. Only the edges of the hammer were treated. The rest of the tool remained as cast. Similarly, no signs of its utilization on a hard material could be detected on its faces or edges. No traces of hammering or polishing have been found on the surface of the axe blade, except for its working edge (cf. Po taszkin and Bar-Avi 1980:237). The surface of the adze blade was found to have been extensively hammered, and its working edge polished. Thus, it seems that in each of these artifacts specific tech niques of casting and surface treatment were intentionally employed and that they reflect the use and the purpose of each of the objects. Each could have been produced by a different artisan.</page><page sequence="35">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 129 CHEMICAL AND LEAD ISOTOPE ANALYSES Methods The artifacts were sampled by drilling small holes up to several millimeters deep, whenever possible in unobtrusive places. In a few in stances such inconspicuous locations were not easily accessible, and the material available for analysis was abraded from the surface rather than drilled. Superficial corrosion products from three maces were analyzed separately in order to check for potential contamination that might be particularly troublesome for the lead isotopy. Also sampled were four repair patches, two from 'Crown' 1, one from 'Crown' 2, and one from one of the short maces (No. 17; Table 1). The chemical composition was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry and/or neutron activation analysis, and the lead isotope abun dances by solid-source mass spectrometry. Whenever the drilling procedure yielded metal shavings, they were semi-quantitatively ana lyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results According to their chemical composition (Table 2) the artifacts fall into three groups, with twenty-two, four, and one members, re spectively: (1) antimony-arsenic-rich objects; (2) pure copper objects; and (3) high-nickel arsenical objects. Antimony-Arsenic-Rich Ceremonial Objects The largest group by far is made up exclusively of ceremonial items. Their metal is charac terized by antimony contents between 1 &lt;70 and 257'c and arsenic contents between û.4% and 1590 (Fig. 29), with Sb/As ratios between 0.9 and 4.6 (average 1.8). The combination of high antimony concentrations with high Sb/As ratios makes for a type of alloy that is exceedingly rare in the Near East and sets these objects apart from all other Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age arti facts, with the exception of some ceremonial Table 1.

Compared to the study of thirty Nahal Mishmar artifacts by Key (1964; 1980), the objects sampled here contain very much higher antimony concentrations and, con sequently, very much higher Sb/As ratios. We are, however, very certain of our antimony con centrations because they were measured in two laboratories by two different techniques using independent standards. We can also exclude the possibility that the high contents of antimony or, for that matter, the variation in antimony content among the objects, are only apparent and caused by segregation. Shavings were analyzed from four objects (Nos. 8, 9, 14, 16) by energy dispersive X-ray Fig. 30. Shaving from Mace 14. The two-phase alloy is made of a-Cu (dark gray) with varying contents of Sb and As (~ Cu95 (Sb, As)5) and Cu3(Sb, As) (light gray, "Stibiodomeykite"). Ni is always present in small amounts. Tiny inclusions scattered throughout the a-Cu are Cu2S with Sb. Areas with white dots are a mixture of Pb, Bi, Ag, Ni. SEM micrograph, back-scattered electrons. The length of the scale bar at the bottom corresponds to 0.01 mm. analysis that revealed a dendritic microstructure of an antimony-arsenic-rich phase with the ap proximate composition Cu3 (Sb, As), intergrown with a-Cu with but minor contents of antimony and arsenic. No change was observed in the mixing ratio between the two from one end of the shavings to the other, i.e. the composition is constant over a depth of a few millimeters. Fur thermore, since the characteristic dimensions of the two phases are 0.02 =־ mm (Fig. 30), it is also assured that drill holes of 1 mm diameter aver age over sufficiently large volumes so as not to have one phase or the other dominate. Flence, although the two artifacts (Nos. 3 and 28) that had previously been analyzed by Key (1980:240, 61-52 and 61-150) are both made of very pure copper so that we cannot directly com pare our data with his, we suspect—as had been posited previously by Shalev and Northover (1987) and subsequently been shown to be the case by the same authors (Shalev and Northover 1993)—that there were serious analytical prob lems in Key's work that led to an occasional underestimation of antimony concentrations by a factor of ten or more. It is not clear whether the fault lies with the spark source optical spec trometry method that, in Key's mode of operation.</page><page sequence="37">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 131 utilizes material for analysis only from the very surface of an object. In the antimony-rich objects, silver, and to a lesser degree arsenic and bismuth, are positively correlated with antimony (Fig. 31). Such a cor relation, in particular between antimony and arsenic, would not be expected if minerals had been utilized as the source material of the metal whose main constituents are either antimony or arsenic, e.g. native antimony and arsenic, real gar (AsS), orpiment (As2S3), arsenopyrite (FeAsS), or stibnite (Sb2S3). Nor should there then be much silver and bismuth in the metal since none of these minerals is known to be a carrier for these two elements. We therefore think it unlikely that any of them played a major role in the production of the ceremonial objects from Nahal Mishmar. On the other hand, the SEM study revealed tiny inclusions of copper antimony-arsenic sulfides within the matrix of a-Cu, which is unambiguous evidence that sul fidic ores were utilized. The element correlations rather suggest that it was fahlerz, a solid solution between tetrahe drite (Cu3SbS3) and tennantite (Cu3AsS3), or their weathering products from near the surface, that served as the source of the correlated ele ments. Fahlerze often contain appreciable amounts of bismuth and silver, and they are frequently associated with copper deposits. Processing them together with the more-or־less pure parent copper ores with which they are associated would introduce the minor elements into the metal while keeping the Sb/As ratio equal to that in the fahlerz. Incidentally, the av erage Sb/As ratio in the artifacts of 1.8 (Fig. 30) is very close to the ratio of the atomic weights of antimony (121.8) and arsenic (75.0) of 1.71, which suggests the source material on average to have been a 1:1 mixture of antimony fahlerz and arsenic fahlerz. This may prove helpful in locat ing the source region because it seems that fahlerze from different ore districts can be distinguished by their major element ratios ! ו • ■י "־ ו ־ ־־ " ז־ • ן ן ן • 4.6 - 56/43 1.8 - •56/4 / • • • ן • • • / • • • י י *• יי • י • • י ✓ / • / • • י י־ * יי וי • • ''' י* י • • י, * י • • יי* 0.9 - •56/4 / , • י, •י. ן • י • ; _ •• • • '', י־••• ! • • • ' ✓ * י • • •• '/ * '" • •• •• '־•.י"/ • • */ 1 1 י • י 1 י יי■' 15 10 5 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.5 [7] 45 [־7] :פ [52] 49 Fig. 31.

(Christoforidis et al. 1988). Note, however, that this holds true only for the mean of the Sb/As ratio, but that there are deviations by more than a factor of two. Apparently, on the mass scale of single furnace charges, there were some vari ations in the composition of the ores, with either the antimony or the arsenic end member of the solid-solution series being predominant. Nickel is present in concentrations of a few tenths of a percent, with one outlier on the high side (No. 9, Ni = 2.1596; Table 2) and two on the low side (Nos. 6, 7, Ni = 0.04596 ־־; Table 2). The correlation with antimony is poor; actually the Sb/Ni ratios vary more than the nickel con centrations. The same holds true for lead, where the objects with the highest antimony contents are among the ones lowest in lead. We find no evidence for the suggestion of Key (1980:241), that "the occasional fairly large amounts of lead may be due to an admixture of scraps of metallic lead from the workshop", but then this sugges tion was not based on any evidence at all in the first place. We shall return to this problem below when the lead isotope abundance data will be discussed. Occasionally, fahlerze also contain tin but this was obviously not so in the present case, as none of the samples contains detectable amounts of tin. In all cases the upper limits for the concen tration are well below the 196 level (Table 2); tin clearly did not play a role as an alloying element in the samples analyzed. Pure Copper Objects The second group of artifacts (Nos. 3, 26-28) is made from very pure copper. The concentrations of all elements analyzed are lower than 0.196, in most cases very much lower. This is in qualita tive accord with the results of Key (1980), who analyzed Nos. 3 and 28 and found antimony, arsenic, bismuth, lead, nickel, tin, zinc, and co bait all below his respective detection limits and only silver in No. 28, present in a concentration of 0.02lib. No. 26 was analyzed by Potaszkin and Bar-Avi (1980), who also found the 'chisel' to consist of 99.596 copper and trace elements of only arsenic, present in detectable amounts (û.27%) only.* SEM analysis showed tiny glob ules of Cu2S, which supports the observed evidence mentioned above that the object was cast and not made from native copper forged into shape, a possibility suggested by Key (1980:240). It has been noted ever since the results of the first chemical analyses became available (Key 1964) that among the Nahal Mishmar artifacts and those from Shiqmim (Shalev and Northover 1987), there is a marked difference between the composition of the metal of prestige objects and that of tools. It has been suggested that prestige items were made of high-arsenical copper, which has now been shown to contain even more antimony than arsenic, while tools con sisted of very pure copper (Key 1980; Shalev and Northover 1987). This result is confirmed by the present data insofar as all three tools in our set of samples fall into the pure copper cate gory (Table 2). On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that not all ceremonial items are made of antimony-arsenic-rich alloys and furthermore, that even among those objects that are made of such alloys there are distinct com positional differences. There are now two maces known to consist of pure copper, No. 3 in our study and 61-104 (Key 1980; Shalev and Northover 1993). To these one might possibly add three more maces (61-40, 61-58, 61-426) for which Key (1980:239) re ports the arsenic content to be below his detection limit (Y.9% arsenic) and all other ele ments (except lead in 61-40) to be present with concentrations below û.1%. In view of the very high detection limit for arsenic as well as the obvious analytical problems in Key's work as to the determination of antimony (see above) and nickel (see below) it would appear prudent, however, to await a re-analysis of these three objects. It should be noted here, and will be elaborated in some detail below (p. 137), that the pure cop per ceremonial objects appear to contain * The authors erroneously attributed Reg. No. 61 137 to this object, instead of the correct registration number, 61-138. See above, Catalogue, No. 26.</page><page sequence="39">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 133 significantly higher concentrations of antimony, arsenic, and nickel than do the tools (Table 2). High-Nickel Arsenical Copper Object Finally, there is one sample (No. 25) that is chemically a maverick. The object is an elon gated, rather exceptional macehead; with a weight of 158 gm (Bar-Adon 1980:121), it is also the fourth-lightest macehead. The metal is an arsenical copper with 4Wo arsenic, but its antimony content of û.016% is several hundred times smaller than that of other ceremonial ob jects with comparable concentrations of arsenic (Table 2). Consequently, the Sb/As ratio of 0.004 is several hundred times lower than the lowest value observed in any of the other arse nic-rich objects. Moreover, the contents of nickel (S.6%), iron (û.36%), cobalt (û.0195%), and zinc (û.020%) are all exceptionally high, while lead and silver are exceptionally low (Table 2; Fig. 29). Two maceheads (61-226, 61 278), of rather ordinary shape and weight, however, are reported by Shalev and Northover (1993) to have very similar chemical composi tions, although 61-278 contains only about 4^0 nickel and is also less extreme in its Sb/As ratio of c. 0.05. Note that 61-226 is another case where there are major discrepancies with the results of Key (1980). Not only is the antimony content reported by Shalev and Northover about ten times lower (G.05% vs. 0.60Ic of Key) but the nickel content of c. 89h is ten times higher than the Q.84% measured by Key. Repair Patches As mentioned above, 'soldered' repair patches on three of the objects ('Crowns' 1 and 2 and a short mace, No. 17) were also sampled and ana lyzed. Most remarkably, in all cases the repair patches match the main objects in their chemical composition as well as the isotopic composition of their lead. Since all three objects are distinctly different from one another, both in the composi tion of the alloy from which they are made and in the lead isotopy, the agreement between the main bodies and their respective repair patches suggests that the repairs were made at the time of casting, by means of the same metal used for casting; and that the repairs were necessitated by faults occurring during casting rather than by those that happened over the course of time. This strengthens the visual observation of the surface in which the polishing marks indicate that the repair patches were polished together with the main bodies; this also suggests that the sequence of work was casting-repair-polishing (see p. 127). Given the high degree of techno logical knowledge that is so amply evident from the artifacts in the Nahal Mishmar hoard, we find it surprising that for ceremonial or prestige items like 'crowns' such—in our eyes—obvious a lack of perfection as is particularly pronounced for 'Crown' 2 should not have been sufficient reason to simply re-melt and re-cast the object. It should be noted that the chemical and lead isotope analyses (Tables 2-4) pertain to the re pair patches themselves. Hence, these data do not allow us to comment on whether or not a low-melting solder was utilized to attach the repair patches to the objects or, as stated by Key (1964:1579; 1980:241), that casting defects were "repaired with lead". The X-ray radio graphs, however, lend no support to such a sug gestion. They rather prove unambiguously that casting, followed by hammering, was the repair method employed (see above, Catalogue, pas sim, and p. 127).</page><page sequence="40">134 M. Tadmor, F.

Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. Discussion A major surprise of the present analytical study is the finding that the chemical composition of many of the ceremonial objects is quite different from what had hitherto been reported. We found antimony concentrations of up to 25.590 by weight and, in the antimony-arsenic-rich ob jects, a mean Sb/As ratio of 1.8 that is some twenty times higher than previously measured (Key 1964; 1980). This is not merely an analyti cal detail, but rather puts these artifacts into a category of their own. Not only are these cere monial objects enigmatic because of their aesthetic beauty and their technical perfection, but many of them also turn out to be made of a type of copper alloy that is unparalleled among analyzed Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age cop per objects from the Near East, with the exception of a few similar finds from other sites in the country. Unfortunately, the number of objects for which reliable chemical analyses exist is still only a deplorable 1090 or so of the total number of metal objects in the Nahal Mishmar hoard, so that one can only speculate about the diversity in chemical composition that might exist among them. It is already clear, however, that not all ceremonial artifacts are made of antimony-arse nic-copper, but that some are made of an arsenic-nickel-copper alloy and that there are also pure copper maces. The latter is quite cer tain: because No. 3 consisted of very clean metal drillings, the result is definitely not due to the analysis of a surface corrosion layer as had been suspected by Shalev (1991) to have been the case for Key's analyses of ceremonial items, which had also correctly indicated them to con sist of pure copper. On the other hand, there are as yet no excep tions to the observation that tool-shaped objects consist of pure copper. It has been remarked before that, from a technical point of view, this seems illogical if indeed these objects were meant to be used as tools. It is hardly conceiv able that the same craftsmen who produced perfect objects of art from alloyed copper should have been unaware of the superior qualities of this material as compared to pure copper and should nevertheless have chosen to make tools from unalloyed copper. It has therefore been suggested that, more likely, the two classes of objects were produced at different times and/or in different geographical areas (Key 1964; Po taszkin and Bar-Avi 1980; Shalev and Northover 1987). But if the Nahal Mishmar ob jects are a trader's hoard (Tadmor 1989; but see Moorey [1988]), and if the ceremonial artifacts and utilitarian tools that were found together at Nevé Noy (Eldar and Baumgarten 1985) should follow the Nahal Mishmar systematics in their chemical composition, then it appears that dif ferent antiquity of the objects is no longer a tenable explanation. They therefore must have been produced in different places. Actually, this assumption appears to have been the predominant view for a long time. Re־ cently, however, there has been some change in that scholars are either ambivalent (Levy and Shalev 1989) or quite outspoken in favor of the local production, even from local ores, of both ceremonial artifacts and tool-shaped objects (Moorey 1988). The evidence behind this shift of opinion appears to be essentially the typologi cal and stylistic connection of these objects with the local Chalcolithic tradition (see above, p. 98); new facts that would allow one to go beyond the realm of speculation have not yet come forward. Presumably, these will have to wait until exca varions have yielded evidence for metal workshops, such as molds and foundry cruci bles—and until such finds, once discovered, have been reliably analyzed. The present mate rial-science data contribute just one small information segment to this problem: the ex treme purity of the copper from which the tools are made demands that the production of their metal and its subsequent utilization must have been kept extremely well separated from that of the antimony-arsenic-rich alloys and, for that matter, from the arsenic-nickel alloy as well. An admixture of only a few parts in a thousand of the alloys to even 10096 pure copper would result in higher concentrations of antimony, ar</page><page sequence="43">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 137 senic, bismuth, and nickel than are observed in the utilitarian objects. This is independent of whether the admixture occurred via ores, foun dry crucibles, or the addition of scrap metal. We would argue that working under such 'clean' conditions was impossible, in particular because there would have been no logical reason to do so. Hence, we propose that the two classes of objects cannot possibly have been produced at the same time in the same place. It is remarkable that the same arguments do not apply to the one mace in our sample that is also made of unalloyed copper (No. 3). Here, the concentrations of the most telling elements—an timony, arsenic, and nickel—are all more than twenty times higher than in the tools. One may speculate that this mace represents an attempt to produce the shape and quality of the high-anti mony, arsenic objects by utilizing pure copper; and that somewhere during this process some contamination with the highly-alloyed copper occurred. The lead isotopy would not negate such an explanation; the isotope abundance ra tios clearly follow the systematics of the lead in the pure copper tools (see below and Fig. 32). The generally inferior quality of the casting, as well as the sloppy execution of the ornamental grooves (see above, Catalogue, No. 3), accords with such a suggestion. Provenance of the Unalloyed Copper We agree with all scholars that the unalloyed copper, or rather the ores that served as starting material of this copper, were 'local'. In particu lar, at nearby Feinan, perfectly suitable high-grade copper ores are available. Chalcolithic slags from this area contain copper prills with trace element concentrations as low as those observed in the Nahal Mishmar objects (Hauptmann et al. 1992), testifying that under Chalcolithic condi tions of extractive metallurgy, these ores yielded the kind of copper metal found in the Nahal Mishmar tools. Moreover, there is also ample evidence that the copper mining and smelting activities at Feinan took place in the Chal colithic period, contemporaneously with Nahal Mishmar (Hauptmann et al. 1985; 1992). No Chalcolithic slags, or copper prills from such slags, have yet been found at Feinan that match the lead isotope abundance ratios (Table 3) of the artifacts. This does not appear to be a serious problem, however, because the complex geology of Wadi Arabah manifests itself also at Feinan in the lead isotopic composition of cop per ores, which is not uniform but shows rather a wide scatter (Hauptmann et al. 1992). The im portant fact is that in all possible three-isotope diagrams, the data points of the four artifacts in question fall on the mixing line between the נ1ק208 נןק206 ־ 29 ־ ^ 27, --'*ו־ 3 - • 26 • • . נ1ק207 נ1ק206 .82 .84 8. 86. נ1ק204 ־ נ1ק206 ־ ־ "&gt;. ־ ־ נ1ק207 ו ו י י נ1ק206 י י 86. 84. 82.

Evidently, the lead isotopic composition in the artifacts is compatible with a derivation of their metal from Feinan.</page><page sequence="44">138 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. extremes observed for slags and metal from Fei nan (Fig. 32). It is very probable that slags with an isotopic signature matching that of the arti facts exist at Feinan and will eventually be found. Among the antimony-arsenic-rich artifacts, there is no correlation between composition and type of artifact. There are maces and maceheads with around 2090 antimony, as well as such with only lc/0 antimony, although the three globular, squat maceheads, i.e. those with a height/diame ter ratio &lt; 1 (Nos. 20-22), are very similar in major and trace element composition. They also happen to be very similar in weight (260 gm, 259 gm, 250 gm [Bar-Adon 1980:121, 127, 129 respectively]). Whether or not this is significant is presently not clear, in particular because it is not immediately obvious to what extent the pre sent weight is affected by the incomplete removal of core material. A uniformity in mass might be relevant if the maceheads were ingots belonging to a trader's hoard. But then why should an ingot, meant to be traded for further use, have been cast over an elaborate toroidal core, as radiography revealed in Macehead 20? Also very much the same in their main con stituents are the two maceheads with bosses (Nos. 9, 10), although here the match between the trace elements iron and cobalt is not equally good. It should be noted that the lead isotopic composition of the individual samples in each group of objects is not the same. Perhaps sur prisingly there is also no 1:1 correlation between composition and quality of casting (Table 2). Although in the case of the pure copper mace (No. 3) and the socketed hammer (No. 28) the casting is particularly poor, the casting of the pure copper adze blade (No. 27) is excellent. Conversely there are among the ceremonial items one mace (No. 4) and two maceheads (Nos. 19, 22) that contain 1.6-3.990 antimony and 1.1-1MSb arsenic where the casting is never theless poor, the objects are porous, and their surfaces are covered with numerous defects. For the set of samples of antimony-arsenic rich artifacts in toto the possibility can be ex eluded that this metal is a mixture of pure copper and an antimony-arsenic-rich alloy. Such a mix ing of components would have been particularly reasonable if the artifacts had been cast at a site, e.g. in the southern Arabah, where copper was locally available but the alloying elements were not, because it would have alleviated the trans port problem by a factor of ten or so. Today this practice is, of course, common, and it has been suggested by Zwicker (1980) to have been in use at Norsuntepe in eastern Anatolia already in the Chalcolithic period. If a homogeneous anti mony-arsenic master alloy had been added to pure copper, the artifacts from Nahal Mishmar, with the same antimony content or, more gener ally, independent of antimony content, should have had the same arsenic content, the Sb/As ratio should be constant, which is not so. The same is not true for certain subsets, however. Among the objects we sampled are three pairs (Nos. 9 and 13; 1 and 18 and 19 and 20) in which the samples in each pair agree in their lead iso tope abundance ratios within ± 0.1and in the Sb/As, Sb/Ag, Sb/Bi, and Sb/Pb ratios within a factor of three (Table 4). For these objects, the metal might in fact have been produced by melting together pure copper with an anti rnony-arsenic-rich alloy, although for the three pairs the respective alloys would have to have been different in their chemical composition as well as in the isotopic composition of their lead. We emphasize, however, that this is mere specu lation and that there is no positive evidence in support of such a hypothesis. Moreover, if in deed antimony-arsenic-rich alloys had been melted together with locally produced copper, this cannot have been the copper as we know it from the tools from Nahal Mishmar nor from the copper prills in slags from Feinan. Both are way too low in their contents of nickel and, in par ticular, silver (Fig. 33). Actually, the observed agreement between the pairs in the three sets of samples of the lead isotopy and the antimony normalized abundances of arsenic, silver, bismuth, and lead might very well also have come about by melting physical mixtures of an timony-arsenic-rich ores and copper ores, either as they occur together in the same ore deposit or</page><page sequence="45">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 139 0.0001 Fig. 33. Nickel and silver contents of Sb-As-rich Nahal Mishmar artifacts (hatched) preclude the possibility that the copper in these objects derived from Feinan. The Feinan data (stippled) are for copper prills from Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age slags (Flauptmann et al. 1992). In the case of silver the left-most bar includes all samples with silver concentrations below Q.0005%. by deliberately mixing the two from different deposits. If it had been a deliberate mixing with the purpose of producing a metal with superior qualities, either utilitarian or aesthetic, one would expect to have found in the artifacts a narrow distribution of antimony, arsenic, or Sb + As contents, which is not the case (Fig. 29). This rather suggests that mixtures of ores were being utilized as they occurred in the ore deposits ex ploited. From Table 3 and Fig. 34 it is immediately obvious that in the antimony-arsenic-rich ob jects, the lead is not of a uniform isotopic composition. We have presented evidence be fore that in many ore deposits—small and large, mono- and polymetallic—the variations in all three lead isotope abundance ratios are a few tenths of a percent at most (Wagner et al. 1989; Pernicka et al. 1993). There are other instances, however, where a much wider scatter has been encountered; at Feinan, e.g., a range of 3.6"$) was found in the 208Pb/206Pb ratios, and even twice as large a range in the abundance ratios 2114Pb/26"Pb (Hauptmann et al. 1992).

Pb isotopy of Nahal Mishmar artifacts. If lead in the Sb-As-rich objects were a mixture of some extreme end members, the four marked compositions (Nos. 4, 12, or 2,18,22) suffice to explain all others. In the lower panel, lead isotope development Unes and isochrons according to the Stacey-Kramers model (1975) are indicated for easy reference. From this panel it is particularly obvious that the lead in the chemical and isotopic outlier No. 25 derives from an entirely different geochemical reservoir with a much lower238 U/204 Pb-ratio (=(1-value) than all others. ber of different ore deposits from which the metal derives. It might have been a single de posit exceptionally heterogeneous in its lead isotopy, or it might have been a number of de posits with different isotopic signatures. At any rate, the Nahal Mishmar artifacts present an un usual situation in which a rather narrow distribution in minor-element contents goes to gether with a wide scatter in lead isotope abundance ratios. The gross isotopic heteroge neity lends no support to the suggestion of Key (1964; 1980:241) that the high lead content in some of the objects might be due to an incidental</page><page sequence="46">140 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. or intentional addition of scraps of lead. There is no trend in the data that samples with high lead contents should have the same isotopic compo sition. On the contrary, the samples with the most extreme lead isotopy show very much the same lead concentrations. Of course, it cannot be excluded that different lead chips, each with a specific isotopic composition, have been added during the manufacture of different artifacts, but such an assumption touches upon the very heart of all provenance studies, namely that the composi tion of artifacts relates to that of ores in a causal way and is not compromised by accidental ad mixtures. Independent of whether the antimony-arsenic rich metal derives from a single, isotopically heterogeneous ore deposit or from different deposits with widely different isotopic composi tions, it stands to reason that not all individual compositions encountered among the artifacts represent an independent ore, or ore body, but rather that some are chance mixtures of more extreme end members. If this were so, and if the extreme end members are among the samples analyzed, then four samples suffice to explain all others as mixtures in appropriate ratios of these four. This is obvious from Fig. 34a, b, where three samples each define a triangle into which all other data points fall. (The total num ber of end members required is four, not three, because only two samples are extreme in both diagrams.) These extreme compositions have to be found in order to eventually identify (a) source ore(s) for the antimony-arsenic-rich metal of the Nahal Mishmar artifacts. Provenance of the Antimony-Arsenic-Rich Metal The provenance of the metal from which the antimony-arsenic-rich ceremonial artifacts are made has always been as enigmatic as their place of production. The present set of chemical analyses should make it possible to pursue the problem in a more scholarly way than has hith erto been possible, in particular because it is now clear that it is not so much the high concen trations of arsenic that make the composition of the alloys so exceptional but rather the even higher contents of antimony. As to the type of ores utilized, sulfidic ores of the fahlerz type appear to be the most promising (Key 1964, 1980; Notis et al. 1984; Shalev et al. 1992). What we have to search for is an occurrence of fahlerz where tennantite, the arsenical variety Cu3AsS3, and tetrahedrite, the variety with anti mony CmSbSj, are present in roughly equal proportions and where accessory nickel miner als are also found. Such a mineral association does not occur at Feinan or Timna nor, for that matter, is it known from anywhere in the Levant or the Sinai Peninsula. It is also unlikely that at Feinan or Timna such ores ever existed, because both deposits are extremely low in arsenic and antimony. Therefore, secondary enrichment processes of the two elements can hardly have resulted in any noticeable amounts of fahlerz. Contrary to Moorey (1988) we consider such arguments sufficiently compelling to search for an ore source further afield and, since there are no ore deposits of any kind known in the north em Arabian Peninsula between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia, we must look for ore sources to the north or the east. The largest cop per ore deposit in the eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus, is not a convincing candidate. First, al though there appear to be surprisingly little data for arsenic and antimony, the semiquantitative analyses by Zwicker et al. (1981) indicate only minor arsenic contents and antimony concentra tions that are below the detection limit of optical emission spectroscopy. This is corroborated by low antimony contents of less than 0.396 in al most all Cypriot copper-based artifacts and by Sb/As ratios that are much too low (Stos-Gale et al. 1986; B. Weinstein 1989) to qualify as candi dates for the high-antimony, high-arsenic metal for which we are looking. Secondly, there is, of course, the chronological argument that on Cy prus the exploitation of copper ores started only a millennium or so after the Nahal Mishmar objects were manufactured. Actually, the only positive evidence près ently available suggests that regions to the north or east contain the potential ore sources (cf. above, Map 1). The strongest hint pointing</page><page sequence="47">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 141 in this direction is the fact that at both Norsun tepe (Zwicker 1980; Seeliger et al. 1985) and Arslantepe (Palmieri et al. 1993) antimony-arse nic-rich copper ores have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest that they belong to the Chalcolithic period. Of these, at least two specimens from Norsuntepe (Tu 35b, Tii 38f) and one from Arslantepe (No. 38) con tain copper, arsenic, and antimony in such proportions that copper alloys produced from them will contain about I5?b of both antimony and arsenic. Since the lead isotopic composition of all three ores falls within the range of the antimony-arsenic-rich artifacts from Nahal Mishmar (Seeliger et al. 1985; and our unpub lished data), these ores in these respects meet the requirements of a potential source. It is not clear at all what purpose these particular ores might have served; since they look rather dull they presumably were not used as ornaments. It is also not clear where they might have originated, except that they do not appear to derive from Ergani Maden, the perennial putative source of early copper, from where not even remotely similar chemical compositions have been re ported. Incidentally, there is another reason why ores from Ergani Maden would not qualify as source material for the Nahal Mishmar metal. The deposit, similarly to those in Cyprus and Oman, is a submarine exhalative deposit, em placed in ophiolite rock suites, and characterized by, inter alia, a high Co/Ni ratio &gt;1 (Seeliger et al. 1985). For comparison, the maximum value of this ratio observed in our sample of ceremo niai objects from Nahal Mishmar is 0.025 (No. 13). In a more positive vein, we note that the re gions of Transcaucasia and the Little Caucasus (Azerbaijan) are very rich in copper ore deposits (Hancar 1937) and that a large variety of arsenic and antimony ores occurs on the southern slope of the Great Caucasus (Smirnov 1989). It has been suggested that, of the latter, the ores from Gornaya Racha in Georgia supplied the metal for the numerous Trialeti bronzes in southern Georgia, a considerable fraction of which are made of an antimony-arsenic-rich copper alloy (Kuftin 1941; Abesadze et al. 1958). Even if these objects are considerably younger than the ones from Nahal Mishmar, the fact remains that in this region there occur ores that match the ceremonial Nahal Mishmar artifacts at least in their major-element composition. It remains to be seen whether or not the same is true also for the trace elements and, in particular, for the lead isotopic composition. In this connection it is perhaps of some interest that the metal at Arslantepe and at nearby Hassek Hoyiik shows no evidence that antimony-arsenic ores have been utilized for its production. The highest an timony content encountered among seventy-six metal objects from Hassek Hoyiik was (J.3%, although arsenic ranged up to 4.970 (Schmitt Strecker et al. 1991). At Arslantepe, the antimony contents in fifty-five artifacts are somewhat higher, but they also do not exceed Q.83%, with but one exception d.62%; Caneva and Palmieri 1983). Another region from which a few ceremonial artifacts with up to about 5 70 of antimony, and equal concentrations of arsenic are known is Luristan (Talion 1982 and unpublished data from the Laboratoire de Recherche des Musées de France and the Max-Planck-Institut fiir Kern physik, Heidelberg). One of these artifacts has been analyzed for the isotopic composition of its lead; it also falls into the Nahal Mishmar trian gles of Fig. 34. Of course, the importance of such spots of concordancy must not be overesti mated but they are nevertheless suggestive. They make it appear that the large copper depos its in northwest and central Iran and in Azerbeijan, including those where copper ores occur together with tetrahedrite (Cu3SbS3) and arsenopyrite (FeAsS) (Schiirenberg 1963; Bazin and Hubner 1969), are promising places in which to search for the source ores of the still enigmatic antimony-arsenic-rich ceremonial objects. For the sake of clarity it should perhaps be re emphasized that the mining area of the ores need of course not be identical with the area in which the smelting of the ores took place nor with the artifact production center(s). While extractive</page><page sequence="48">142 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. metallurgy almost certainly was invented in re gions where suitable ores were available, there is abundant evidence from Mesopotamia and elsewhere that 'soon' thereafter ores and metal were traded over long distances, and that the artisans expert in processing the metal lived far away from the ore sources along some pre viously established trade routes. Parallels to the Arsenic-Nickel Alloy Nickel-rich arsenical copper objects are exceed ingly rare in the early metal-producing periods in Europe but rather common in the Near East. The Stuttgart data base, e.g., lists just twelve out of a total of some twenty-five thousand Euro pean samples where an arsenic content of more than 2"/c occurs together with more than 20/c nickel. Furthermore, most of these contain 0.1 û.5% antimony, which is more than that found in Mace 3, so that the compositions are actually somewhat different. In the Near East, on the other hand, the percentage of nickel-rich arti facts is much higher. Indeed, ever since the first reports by the Sumerian Copper Committee on the chemical composition of third millennium Mesopotamian objects, nickel has been consid ered to be the most telling trace element for assigning provenance (Desch 1928). Regretta bly, many of the early analyses failed to report arsenic contents without specifying whether it was not searched for or whether it was below the limits of detection and, if the latter, what the limits of detection were. Eleven metal objects from Amuq F, for instance, were reported to contain copper and nickel as 'major' constitu ents (&gt; 10Vo), while arsenic was listed as 'minor' (0.1-1.091?). In one case the emission lines of arsenic were 'strong' il-10% arsenic; Braid wood and Braidwood 1960). It is impossible to relate these semiquantitative analyses obtained by optical emission spectroscopy to our data, but they provide a hint that metal of composition similar to Macehead 25 may have been used in the Amuq region at roughly the same time. More recent work, in particular the hundreds of analy ses performed in the course of the Mesopotamian Metals Project of the University Museum, Uni versity of Pennsylvania, does not suffer from such shortcomings. Their data show that at Ur, e.g., some 159b of all metal artifacts contained more than 29b of both nickel and arsenic (at Tepe Gawra, on the other hand, it was only one sample out of one hundred eighteen). It should be noted, however, that the concentrations of both elements cluster around 3 9b and that, with but one exception (5.39b), the nickel content is always below 59b. Similar results were obtained in a joint project of the Institut fiir Ur- und Friihgeschichte (Heidelberg University) and the Max-Planck-Institut fiir Kemphysik by non-de structive XRF analyses of some nine hundred copper-based objects from Ur in the British Mu seum collection, with nickel ranging up to 5.99b and arsenic up to 16.196. According to the litera ture, the regional distribution of this type of metal extends in a northerly direction up to the northern Caucasus (Maikop, Kuban), where very peculiar alloys, with 149b nickel, 129b arse nic, and 496 cobalt, have been reported (Virchow 1891). Highly alloyed copper-arsenic-nickel metal is difficult to produce by the ordinary reduction smelting of a mixture of sulfide ores because, together with nickel (or iron), arsenic tends to form a separate liquid phase in the smelting fur nace called speiss, that reduces the metal yield of the smelting process or leaves hardly any metal at all. One may therefore speculate that this type of metal derives from a type of non-sul fidic ore that contains the three major components of this alloy but no, or at least only minor, amounts of sulfur. Such a type of copper ore occurs in the well-known Anarak district near Kashan on the Iranian plateau, especially in the mines at Talmessi and Meskani (Schiirenberg 1963). These deposits also contain uranium but little thorium, which could give rise to such an unusual lead isotopic composition as measured in Macehead 25.</page><page sequence="49">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 143 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Summary The chemical composition of the artifacts di vides them into three groups: (1) twenty-two ceremonial objects—'crowns', maces, and maceheads—made of antimony-arsenic-rich copper, with contents of antimony between 1910 and 259fc and that of arsenic between û.4% and 1596; (2) four items—three tools (Nos. 26-28) and one mace (No. 3)—made of very pure cop per; (3) one macehead (No. 25) composed of nickel-arsenical copper (S.6% nickel, 4.196 arse nic), but with exceptionally low contents of antimony iO.016%). As two other maceheads with a similar chemical composition were re ported by Shalev and Northover (1993:7, Table 1, 61-226 and 61-278), we may postulate, with some degree of confidence, the existence of a larger group of comparable objects among the Nahal Mishmar artifacts. At the present stage of our knowledge it is clear that many, but not all, ceremonial objects are made of antimony-arsenic-rich copper rather than of arsenical copper as previously reported and that some are made of a nickel-arsenic-cop per alloy. In addition, Mace 3 indicates that some ceremonial objects were also made of pure copper. All new evidence is compatible with the as sumption that the ores which served as the raw material for the unalloyed copper are of local origin. Suitable ores exist at the Feinan mines in the Arabah, and evidence of Chalcolithic mining and smelting has been found there in excava tions, yielding the type of metal that occurs in the Nahal Mishmar objects made of pure copper. It must be pointed out that, for the time being, no Chalcolithic slags or copper prills from such slags from Feinan correspond in their lead iso tope abundance ratios to the Nahal Mishmar artifacts. However, this is not seen as a major problem, as it is believed that slags with a suit able isotopic signature will eventually be found there. The situation is different regarding the prove nance of the antimony-arsenic-rich metal, a rare type of copper alloy attested only in the artifacts from the Nahal Mishmar hoard and from several other sites in Israel, but from no other contempo rary site in the Near East. For reasons specified above, it is here concluded that this type of metal is not a mixture of pure copper and an antimony arsenic-rich alloy, but rather that mixtures of ores were utilized as they occurred in the ore deposits; it might have been a single deposit, exceptionally heterogenous in its lead isotopy, or it might have been a number of deposits with different isotopic signatures. Ores suitable for this type of metal, namely fahlerz where tennan tite and tetrahedrite are present in roughly equal proportions and are associated with accessory nickel minerals, do not occur at Feinan or at Timna, and it is unlikely that such ores ever existed there. In fact such ores are not known from anywhere in the Levant between the Medi terranean Sea and Mesopotamia, in Cyprus, or at Ergani Maden in Anatolia. The only regions rich in suitable arsenic and antimony copper ores are Transcaucasia and the Little Caucasus in Azer baijan and the southern slope of the Great Caucasus in Georgia. The arsenic-nickel alloy of Macehead 25 be longs to a category of metals found in artifacts from early periods in the Near East, e.g. in some fifteen out of one hundred copper-based objects from Ur and possibly also in eleven objects from Amuq F. A similar type of metal has been re ported from areas up to the northern Caucasus. It is perhaps worth mentioning that ores suitable for producing such alloys occur in the Anarak district in Central Iran. Technologically, maces, maceheads, and 'crowns', each unique in measurement and decoration, were cast over a core in the lost-wax casting technique; each was cast in a single cast ing, with all the details of ornamentation included in the mold. The fact that they were all cast in closed molds indicates that the technique of casting in bi-valve molds was not known. The deliberate use of antimony-arsenic-rich metal is but one piece of evidence testifying to the professional proficiency of these early smiths. The remarkable expertise in mold</page><page sequence="50">144 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. making and in casting must be noted while the complexity of design and the precision of its execution bespeak their high artistic and sculptural abilities. Only the two tool blades are solid casts. The hammer (No. 28) and the mace (No. 3) indicate, however, that the knowledge of lost-wax casting was not limited to the producers of the ceremonial objects who worked with antimony arsenic-rich copper or with the arsenic-nickel alloy, but that it was also known to smiths who produced artifacts from pure copper. It can no longer be maintained that the tools were made of native copper forged into shape. Likewise, no strict division into two groups can be made with regard to finishing techniques. As a rule, ceremonial objects were extensively polished, first roughly and then finely, but evidence of polishing was also found on the surfaces of tools, although it was there more selectively applied. Traces of hammering were found on all types of objects: it was used to obliterate surface defects and to flatten repaired surfaces, usually with more success in maceheads than in 'crowns'. We found no indication for the use of filing instruments; this absence may account for the extensive use of hammering in repairs and may explain why excess metal, such as stumps of sprues, was not completely removed. Two types of molds were distinguished, possi bly representing different casting traditions. Usually, the inner core was attached to the outer mold by some external means, of which no traces remained in the finished object. In some cases, however, the two sections were linked by an interior support. It is likely that this method, previously attested only in the Type D toroidal maceheads, was also used in some maceheads of solid metal construction (e.g. No. 23) and in some maces (e.g. Nos. 8 and 13). In the latter case, the one-sided support did not prevent a slight movement during casting, resulting in a wall of uneven thickness. Similar objects vary in their interior struc tures. Within each type there are poor and porous casts as well as good casts with few or no pores. Therefore, it seems that many objects were made by expert smiths, though some may have been produced by apprentices. On the other hand, perhaps the intricate details of producing a perfect cast were not yet fully understood and the result was to some extent still a question of happenstance. At any rate, the ability to cast maces of considerable length and very thin walls is remarkable even by standards of modem technology. The position of each object during casting could be deduced from concentrations of poros ity in certain areas and from the location of sprues. In many maces and maceheads, the shaft holes narrow toward the top. Undoubtedly this was an intentional structural device incorporated by the mold makers so that, when mounted, the objects would be securely positioned without slipping. This technical detail proved useful also in determining the top and bottom of certain maceheads. Numerous casting defects—porosity and holes—were observed and repair techniques were studied. In all instances in this project, the defects were repaired by casting, not by soldering as previously assumed. Repairs took place immediately after casting, with the same metal, and the new surfaces were flattened and polished together with the rest of the object. Untreated and unpolished surfaces of knobs and bosses may indicate that these protrusions broke in use. Occasionally, metal leaking through cracks blocked the shaft holes of maces, and various accidents prevented the complete removal of core material; in these cases, the mace could not be mounted on a pole. In 'crowns', some holes were repaired while others remained. However, the 'crowns' were not remelted and recast; the task of recasting these large objects may have been too formidable even for these skillful smiths.</page><page sequence="51">The Nahal Mishmar Hoard 145 Conclusions Our study of technology, composition, and provenance by diverse techniques presents a far more complex and varied situation for the Nahal Mishmar hoard than previously suggested. Three, not just two, types of raw materials must be assumed for ceremonial objects—antimony arsenic-rich copper, high-nickel arsenical copper and pure copper—each group with its own provenance. Furthermore, mounting evi dence precludes a rigid division into two technologies: a 'simple' one of forging, em ployed in the manufacture of tools made of pure copper; and an, 'advanced' one of casting, used in ceremonial objects composed of alloys. There exist good and poor castings in each group. Similar finishing techniques were employed in artifacts of both groups. No correlation was found between composition and type in the anti mony-arsenic-rich maces and maceheads and in the tools made of pure copper, nor between com position and quality of casting. Material-science considerations rule out the possibility that ob jects made of pure copper and those made of complex alloys were produced at one place at the same time. Moreover, differences in the quality of casting and finishing indicate that within each category, even within each type, the artifacts were made by various hands. All these data offer a considerable refinement to the the ory of 'two technologies' that has been assumed for the Nahal Mishmar hoard since its publica tion. But the riddle still remains: Why did the smiths cast tools from pure copper, when cere monial objects were produced from an alloy that is superior in many of the qualities demanded of a tool? As already mentioned, the unalloyed copper was most probably mined at nearby Feinan, but the complex ores, required for most of the cere monial objects, do not occur at Feinan or at Timna, and it is unlikely that such ores ever existed there. It has also been shown that the antimony-arsenic-rich copper is not a result of a mixture of pure copper and antimony-arsenic alloy, but rather that ores were utilized as they occurred in the exploited mine. Here we are left with another outstanding enigma that has not been resolved by the present study. Lead isotope analyses have added a new type of evidence, and the study of provenance is now based on a large body of comparative mate rial. Scientists still attribute the origins of the complex alloys, or at least the ores from which they are derived, to distant lands in Asia; archae ologists and art historians believe that the ceremonial artifacts were made in the Negev Judean Desert-Arabah region, where a comparable artistic repertoire was prevalent at that time. Therefore, it must be postulated that considerable quantities of ores, or more prob ably of metal ingots, were transported over vast territories, to be crafted in the artistic tradition of the Chalcolithic period in Ancient Israel. A hoard of that size could not have been produced at one time; therefore we must assume that these long-distance contacts existed over a consider able period. In consequence, one must also surmise that there existed an adequate social organization, able to control a continuous flow of raw materials and supervise the logistics of their transfer and distribution. These assump tions have far-reaching consequences for the nature of the local Chalcolithic period. Our study of the Nahal Mishmar hoard is the most comprehensive to date in relation to chemi cal composition, and the first to employ radiography and to deal with the isotopic com position of the traces of lead in these objects. But it must be kept in mind that a group of only twenty-eight objects was studied, clarifying some aspects of their technology, composition, and provenance. Therefore, for the time being, all theories must be regarded as tentative, re fleeting the limits of our present knowledge. It is hoped that this is but a pilot study and that future interdisciplinary studies will provide a broader basis for the understanding of this spectacular and, to a large degree, still enigmatic treasure.</page><page sequence="52">146 M. Tadmor, F. Begemann et al. Acknowledgements We are grateful to the Director and staff of the Israel Antiquities Authority for allowing us to study these objects and their assistance and ad vice throughout. Thanks are also due to the S. Bronfman Museum of Archaeology and Bible of the Israel Museum, where radiographic data were processed and objects sampled, and espe cially to O. Misch-Brandl, Curator of the Chalcolithic and Bronze periods, for her help. M. Tadmor and D. Kedem wish to gratefully acknowledge the grant of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities for Basic Research, which supported the radiographic examination of approximately two hundred items of the hoard, of which our present selection is part. The radiography was undertaken in the Non Destructive Testing Department at the Nahal Soreq Nuclear Center. M. Tadmor is grateful to the Esther and Simon Geldwerth Foundation, New York for its support. A. Hauptmann is most appreciative of the financial support provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.
