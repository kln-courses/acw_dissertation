LOUIS, MAY 2, 3, AND 4, 1935 Harris and the St. Louis Movement in Philosophy. CHARLES M. PERRY. In beliefs and institutions American life has been from the first flowing intermittently from higher to lower potentials. Outstand- ing men and schools have fought this tendency. The St. Louis Movement in Philosophy was a continuation of this fight. Its book of inspiration was Hegel 's larger Logic. In the first place, the movement was philosophical, religious, and critical. In the second place, it was educational. Harris was the most effective member of the group. His influ- ence in promoting philosophy and educational theory in St. Louis and in the surrounding country was great. He was also a capable school administrator. In the schools he used his absolute idealism as a warrant, on the one hand, for organization and discipline and, on the other, for the encouragement of self-activity. The heyday of the movement was from 1867 to 1880. From the latter date a dispersion of the leaders took place. Harris went first to Concord, Massachusetts, and then to Washington. It is not desirable for Americans to go back to Hegel, but in the reintegration of their life they may well emulate the idealism and high courage of Harris and his colleagues. Harris and the Journal of Speculative Philosophy. EDWARD L. SCHAUB. Significant indeed was the career of Harris during the period of twenty-two years when he resided in St. Louis. Co-ordinate with his contributions to the public school system of the city and with his further cultural influence through private classes, the Kant Club, and the St. Louis Philosophical Society, were his services in connec- tion with The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. That he con- tinued as the sole editor of this Journal throughout its history (1867- 1893), that he included in its pages much of his own best philosophi- cal work, and that he made substantial financial contributions to its support, are easily established facts. The weight of evidence, more- over, points to him and not to Brockmeyer as its originator. Spe- cific incidents (recorded by Snider and Stratton) precipitated the Journal; yet essentially it expressed clearly envisaged purposes re- lating to three sets of social needs: religious, political, and intel-</page><page sequence="2">292 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY lectual. These needs, Harris was convinced, could be met only by the dissemination of philosophical ideas genuinely speculative in character. For him this meant a transcending of simple and sheer empiricism to an apprehension in which particulars are construed as indissoluble from universals, the finite from the infinite; a transcend- ing also of the view that things, while to be sure not existing iso- latedly and not knowable immediately through sense, are neverthe- less intelligible through processes (called understanding) which dis- close the relationships of things with one another-a transcending of this view to one which realizes that things must be recognized as pos- sessing self-identity and that the ultimate principle of intelligibility is that of self-relation, such as we find exemplified in self-conscious- ness and self-determination. In genuine philosophy form is organic to content and the method is inseparable from the subject-matter; hence linguistic expression can be faithful and really intelligible only if it is dominated by the requirements of philosophy itself in- stead of being attuned to the familiarities of the non-philosophical. Some defence may thus be made of charges that the articles in the Journal appear in a style infelicitous and obscure. Harris and Indian Philosophy. KURT F. LEIDECKER. Few Western philosophers have as keenly appreciated the im- portance of Hindu philosophy as did Harris. This is the more re- markable in that he found himself at variance with many of the fundamental ideas. A Hegelian, he gave, as one of the first in America, a clear account of the history of Indian thought, imper- fectly though it was known at the time. Brahmanism with its typical concepts and supposedly monistic- pantheistic tendencies was more critically studied by Harris than the dualism of the Saiikhya. In as far as the latter lies partially at the centre of the Bhagavad Gita, he could even agree with much of it. Valuable are the parallels he uncovered in modern thinkers. Insight and error are mixed frequently in the treatment of concepts of Buddhistic and general Hinduistic origin. Harris formulated and re-formulated more clearly than anyone else at the time the discrepancies between Western and Oriental modes of thinking and reduced them to their respective logical and ethical presuppositions. The paper presents some details of Harris's discussions which are astoundingly numerous, thus reflecting more than a passing, superficial interest in the problems of Indian phi- losophy. Positivism-Not Negativism. HERBERT FEIGL. The New Positivism (Logical Positivism of the Vienna circle) has quite unjustly come to be viewed as a sort of philosophical pro-</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 293 hibitionism. Yet the positivist rejection of metaphysics concerns only the erroneous pretense of factual meaning in assertions which have merely formal meaning or carry an emotive appeal. The cri- terion which decides presence or absence of factual meaning is in itself not a piece of philosophical dogmatism, but the result of an impartial analysis of the various functions of language. In the light of this criterion (essentially a clarified and more precisely formulated version of C. S. Peirce's pragmatic rule) it becomes clear that most of the traditional philosophical issues rest on confusions of meaning and accordingly are mixtures of real with pseudo-prob- lems. It can be shown that the modernized Occam's razor does not cut away from the body of knowledge anything worth preserving. Scientific realism, if only thoroughly free of absolutistic elements, is perfectly legitimate and its precise meaning is for the first time fully elucidated on the basis of a logical analysis. Thus the appar- ently so destructive critique merely opens the path for the more important, constructive endeavors of the New Positivism. These lie in the positive clarification of formal and factual meanings. Logical analysis thus indeed replaces metaphysics and distributes its legiti- mate components to such activities in which there is no false pre- tense: studies of logical syntax; empirical science; art; contempla- tion and practical action. Logical Analysis and Metaphysics. DAVID F. SWENSON. This paper attempts to trace a relationship between two theses: the first, that conceiving the function of philosophy in terms of an alternative between logical analysis and metaphysics involves the stipulation of an illicit disjunction, and that the philosopher can not be absolved, qua philosopher, from the responsibility of formulating a theory of existence; the second, that philosophy is inevitably rooted in the common sense of mankind, whose substantial content is also the substantial content of all philosophy. The philosopher can not abstract from the essential anthropomorphic attitudes embodied in common sense; in seeking a comprehensive reflective representation of the content of common sense he necessarily presupposes both it and them. Common sense is defined as the unifying centripetal force in human life, mediating between its many centrifugal tendencies and its specialized skills and knowledges. It is characterized as cul- minating in belief, in the acceptance and rejection of supposed exist- ences; the reflective embodiment of such beliefs, with the critical and systematizing activities incident to conceptualization, is metaphysics. Without metaphysics common sense is blind, without common sense metaphysics is empty of content.</page><page sequence="4">294 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY A number of objections to metaphysics are analyzed. Some are shown to depend on a negative reaction to special metaphysical re- sults, or to special forms of metaphysical reflection; it is remarked that these objections do not proceed from any firm grasp of the prob- lem of metaphysics itself, apart from accidental historical attempts at solution. But it is further argued that the most fundamental ob- jection to metaphysics is ultimately rooted in a distrust of the func- tioning of the category of transcendence in common sense, in science, and in philosophic thought; this distrust attempts to reach, by the repudiation of this category, the greater safety and security ap- parently promised by immanence. The paper argues that the latter is essentially a sceptical position; it attempts to show, by tracing the presence of transcendent functions in all forms of meaning (intent), in memory and anticipation, in perception and in belief, that this position constitutes an abandon- ment of fundamental vital functions only realizable in imagination, or by some form of self-deception, or as a part of an attempt to reach self-extinction through thought. It is suggested that what philosophy most needs at the present time is a revival of a "power- ful and full-blooded anthropomorphism, which makes no apologies for being human, and is not ashamed to avow the belief that what is deepest in human nature and human life, is also a key to the mys- tery of the cosmos.)" Philosophy of Science and Science of Philosophy. CHARLES W. MORRIS. The orientation of philosophy around science is here accepted, and also the view that philosophy obtains no results of an order of certainty superior to those of science. Among the alternatives which such acceptances leave for philosophy four are of major significance: (1) the identification of philosophy with the logic of science (Car- nap); (2) the consideration of philosophy as the activity of clari- fying meaning (Wittgenstein); (3) the interpretation of philosophy as an empirically oriented axiology, culminating in a concern for the ethical potentialities of that type of intelligent procedure which has come to be called scientific (Dewey) ; (4) the defense of philos- ophy as empirical cosmology (Whitehead, in part). These concep- tions deal with complementary and not opposed aspects of the various dimensions of meaning, so that formalism, pragmatism, and empiricism are complementary phases of the positivistic temper. This result is embodied in the expression "scientific empiricism," the term "empiricism" indicating the acceptance of concepts and propositions in proportion as they are based upon and controllable by evidence, and the term "scientific" suggesting not merely that</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 295 science is the recognized focus of orientation, but also that whatever formalistic, pragmatic, and cosmological factors are operative in the scientific enterprise are compatible with this version of empiricism. The proposed formulation accepts and reconciles all four of the considered conceptions of philosophy. Metaphysics for Positivists. CHARLES HARTSHORNE. Metaphysics is knowledge of the broadest features within ex- perience, not of what is entirely outside experience. Its arguments are experiential, but not inductive. Laws inductively arrived at are conceivably subject to evolution; no final "law of the evolution of law" can be known inductively. The law of induction itself is not induced. Ideal experiment- " dialectic "-alone can verify such eternal, necessary laws. Yet dialectic is perhaps only induction applied to perceptual content "freely varied" (Husserl) in imagina- tion. "Idealisms" and "realisms" often contain "meaningless" aspects. But panpsychism means that it is meaningless to try to generalize beyond the analogy that defines the concept of actual individual-the analogy (which has an infinity of degrees) to our- selves as individuals. Though a metaphysics in its full generality as eternal truth can only be verified dialectically, special applications of such truth to the present cosmic epoch are verifiable inductively. The major steps of science since Newton confirm the hypothesis that in this cosmic epoch all individuals (rocks, etc., being crowds not individuals) are analogous to man, i.e., behavioristically psychic. Psycho-physics carries us even beyond behavioristic tests, since we directly intuit the psychic contents of our nerve cells. Panpsychism is verifiable dialectically, behavioristically, and psycho-physically. Toward Understanding the Mitesians. PAUL RUSSELL ANDERSON. The dominant cause of the development of Greek metaphysics in Miletus lies on the one hand in an inadequate literary religion and on the other hand in a successful practical science which was led on to develop a cosmology of its own. The Milesians were more familiar with the literary religion than any other type of religion. This literary religion, as presented by Homer and Hesiod, was highly theological in its content empha- sizing the problem of causes and principles of explanation. It placed the gods in an intermediate position between nature and man; in so doing, it opened the way for the scientists to propose that man might deal directly with nature and leave the gods behind. In addition, the position of the gods was shaky enough in itself; it remained only for the scientists to deal the telling blow. Science came to supplant the literary religion. The scientific</page><page sequence="6">296 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY heritage and many of the scientific interests of the Greeks were practical in nature and hence were acceptable because they suc- cessfully satisfied human needs. Scientific interests were based upon belief in a world of natural laws uninfluenced by capricious gods; the gods became unnecessary. The concentration of the literary re- ligion upon principles of explanation led the scientists on to develop a cosmology of their own. Their cosmology consisted of natural over against supernatural forces and material or quasi-material principles of explanation over against belief in capricious deities. Their cosmology was both inspired by the literary religion and the intellectual death of it. The Realism of Bosanquet and Watson. L. P. CHAMBERS. In the spirit of the protest which Bosanquet, in the "Preface" to his Meeting of Extremes, makes against the supposed antagonism between idealism and realism, this paper attempts to vindicate the realism of two outstanding idealists as against the conviction of many that all idealisms are subjective. Many passages can be cited from these writers which at first reading seem to support the charge of subjectivism. But Bosanquet and Watson do not think of mind in the subjectivist sense, i.e., as excluding matter, but think of consciousness as a function of the organism, and of milnd as the field of objects known. According to representationalism, the whole content of experience consists of "ideas" which represent, but never are, reality. Neo- realism and Hegelianism agree, however, that what we meet in experience is reality itself, including physical things in all their brute extendedness. Bosanquet and Watson therefore accept the contribution of the physical sciences; not, however, with the older materialism, denying the spiritual interpretation of reality, nor, with the older idealism, reducing physical reality to ghostly figments of the imagination; but as finding in the physical world firm footing for the transcendent spiritual values of art, morality, religion. On this basis does Bosanquet propose that philosophers should unite in the search for truth not under antagonistic banners, but under some such heading as that of "speculative philosophy." Beauty a,nd Value. D. W. GOTSHALK. The thesis of this paper is that beauty is a value, a value which entities possessing other values are seen to have when taken esthet- ically. The paper has two parts. In the first, the thesis is stated by illustratioiis of the major types of beauty: functional, material, formal. and expressive, to which is added a comment to indicate that beauty is an autonomous value. In the second part, the thesis</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 297 is amplified by brief discussion of four esthetic problems, viz., the relations between (a) beauty and the esthetic, (b) beauty and the immediate, (c) beauty and subjectivity, and (d) beauty and rela- tivity. The main aim of this part is to add further clarification and verification of the thesis. The incidental results are that beauty (a) does not exhaust esthetic quality, (b) is not identical with the merely immediate, (c) is, in an ontological sense, objective, but (d) also relative. A brief indication of the relation between beauty and art occurs at the end. The Problem of Historical or Cultural Reality in Contemporary Thought. BONNO TAPPER. The problem of historical or cultural reality is encountered in such well-known phrases as the spirit of a people and of a com- munity; the spirit of a craft and of industry; the spirit of Greece and Rome; of the Renaissance and Romanticism. In these phrases does the word "spirit" describe any reality; and if so, what kind of reality does it describe? The paper is divided into two parts. The first part deals with spirit as found in cultural objects or with objectified spirit. It is argued that the objectified spirit has no life or being of its own, and that in contrast to our knowledge of persons that of cultural objects can be explained without taking recourse to spirit. The second part deals with spirit as a power experienced in life or with objective spirit. The reality of objective spirit is de- nied, and the apparent continuity of its life and its power are ex- plained in terms of subjective experience. I agree with the advo- cates of spirit that naturalism or physicalism can not give a satis- factory account of cultural life. But neither can spiritualism if it does not make the willing, thinking, feeling, doing self its funda- mental category. Truth and the Interest Theory of Value. MERRITT HADDEN MOORE. Given that many have undertaken to deal with truth as a value category, the thesis of this paper is that it is excluded from such treatment if one takes value to be a function of interest. This is true regardless of one's definition of truth. Traditionally there are three such definitions: truth is consistency; truth is correspondence; truth is practical efficacy. Following Mr. Perry, the interest theory of value also has three aspects: value is interest in a qualified object; value is the object of qualified interest; value is any object of any interest. My thesis is most easily stated against the third of these alternatives. However, it holds against all three.</page><page sequence="8">298 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY My argument is as follows. Truth is a normative category as are value and interest. But as a norm, its form is not that of value as related to interest. Thus truth and interest as related to value are incommensurable. However one defines truth, its norm is ob- jective; however one defines value as related to interest, its norm is subjective. It is true that the particular definition of truth we ac- cept may be dependent upon an interest. But once this interest selects its criterion of truth, that criterion is found to be a formal standard which is independent of the interest in the sense that hav- ing set up a given standard of truth we have a norm which limits in- terest, but which, in turn, is not limited by it. Therefore, while it is true that we are interested in truth, the formal, normative character of truth in which we are interested is not itself a function of that interest. Modern Physics aind the Lauw of Identity. OLIVER L. REISER. The problem of the theoretical possibility and scientific useful- ness of non-Aristotelian logic has recently come to the front and must be investigated. One demonstration of the utility of non-Aris- totelian principles in physics involves the establishment of the fol- lowing theses: I. The postulates of Newtonian (classical) physics are a neces- sary consequence of the postulates of Aristotelian logic. II. The acceptance of non-Newtonian physics demands the ac- cepta,nce of a non-Aristotelian logic. Since, by recognized processes of inference, the second thesis can be deduced from the first, the main purpose of the paper is to examine the validity of the first thesis. The postulates of classical physics are made explicit, and their relation to traditional logical postulates revealed. The r6le of "identity" in science and in logic is stated. An examination of contemporary physical doctrine shows that each of these assumptions is questionable. A possible revision in terms of non-Aristotelian logic is therefore considered. Logical Space. VIRGIL C. ALDRICH. Logical space is the space of possibility. The relation of logical space to physical space has been made mysterious by the unwarranted prejudice that "logical?" is the characteristic of conceptual systems confined to minds, and that the actual or physical is in itself non- logical. This same prejudice manifests itself differently in ideal- ism, where the effort to overcome the above dualism results in the mentalizing of actuality.</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 299 A more adequate conception is as follows: taking "reality" to mean the total system of actualities and possibilities (potentialities), any "real thing" in nature is both actual and potential, though not in the same respect. In respect of its actuality, it is "incurably atomic" (Whitehead) and the ideal limit of actuality is the "point- instant." But with respect to its potentiality, it has organic con- nections, it is communal, it potentially enjoys a past and a future, it is not a "particular" at all. This is its logical dimension. The data of ordinary perception are logico-spatio-temporal. Thus any real thing has, besides its physical context, a logical context, and the perceptual field is a blend of the actual and the possible. "Mind" is a name for a certain kind of activity, the activity of thinking. Though one thinks with his brain (or his whole nervous system), he does not think in his brain-just as one walks with his legs, but not in his legs (Woodbridge). And as walking takes one through reality-a logico-spatio-temporal realm-so thinking as an activity is also an adventure through a realm, the realm of pos- sibility. The various "logics" are reports on thought-possibilities in logical space. Since one thinks or conceives not only the pos- sible, but also the actual, physical space is in logical space, in an undefined sense of "in." Which is a way of saying that the laws of thought are also laws of things. Beyond Political Democracy. JAY WILLIAm HUDSON. Praises and condemnations of democracy can not be evaluated because of preliminary conflicts of definition. The political defini- tion as "government by the people" is neither precise nor adequate, e.g., what is government by the people? Why? How is the popu- lar will to be conceived: atomistically? Organically? What are the limits of democracy? e.g., does it means economic democracy? Socialism? Communism? The political definition sheds no light. Political democracy merely a means to an end: we must transcend it to clarify it. In reality, democracy is a new and momentous theory of the person: viz., persons are social, free, priceless, measure- less in capacities, rational. Democracy is the essential condition for the self-realization of the person as so defined. Politically, it will be constantly shifting, depending upon the exigencies of the time. The central problems just now are: the competence of the voter, the basis of representation, the limits of law, and interna- tionalism. The False Principle of Liberalism. E. JORDAN. Liberalism is a state of mind. Its significance lies in the fact that it is not primarily an idea or an intellectual conviction, but an</page><page sequence="10">300 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY emotional attitude. It has dominated all our practical activities and interests in recent times, and it has been predominant in de- termining the form and the content of modern politics, ethics, law, religion, and esthetics, both in fact and in theory. Its form and motive change from one of these to another, but it has a dominant part in determining the principle underlying the ideas and tech- niques of all of them. Thus liberalism becomes the principle of toleration in politics, the principle of benevolence in ethics, the principle of love in religion, etc. In each the practical conse- quences are negative, the tendency is for the principle to contradict itself in its opposite, and to establish and objectify itself in a system quite different from that intended. It deceives itself as to its means, and perverts itself in its ends. The reason for this failure is that liberalism has and can have no principle. It attempts to erect into a principle the assumption that reality is in every and all cases a state of mind, which appears to rest on the faulty conversion of the proposition "Mind is real" into " Mind is the real" or "Reality is a state of mind." This proposition appears to be the basic assumption of modern culture in all its aspects. Culture then rests on a subjective principle. But subjective principle is a contradiction, failure to recognize which is the cause of the existing confusion in both the theory of practice and in practical affairs. And the attempt to give positive character to these subjective attitudes has resulted in universal falsification in practice, and fraud and deception in theory. When Philosophers Are Kings. HERBERT MARTIN. Neither during the war nor in the present crisis has philosophy made any contribution toward the solution of our vast social prob- lems. In fact she was not solicited because it was assumed, probably correctly, that she had nothing to offer. This fact most regular devotees would proudly justify on the ground that such is not her function. The suggestion of such commerce is an unpardonable indignity. Nevertheless philosophy is increasingly obligated to such participation. Her future is not assured when interpreted as a private indulgence in the pursuit of ultimate truth and reality via logistic and dialectic. When philosophers are kings-a dream? Yes, but dreams some- times come true. It required little imagination to detect a pro- gression in this matter from Plato to the present. Plato's was a utopian dream with no regrets as to its terrestrial unreality. Heaven, if anywhere, was its abode; it did not descend to earth. Actual kingship was approximated if not actualized, among others,</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS 301 by the monumental accomplishments of Lord Haldane.

When the principles of historic liberalism are examined afresh today they would seem to involve a twofold departure from the prac- tices of the older liberalism. First, economic liberty is to be secured in our present social context not by laissez-faire, but by surrounding economic power with the same safeguards that have been placed about the exercise of political power, so as to eliminate its capricious and irresponsible exercise. Can the democratic state secure control over entrenched economic power? In any case it is naive to think we can gain freedom from economic tyranny by surrendering our- selves body and soul to the authoritarian state. Secondly, individual responsibility is to be saved only by a wider extension of the social services, so that the essential material conditions of a civilized life may be brought within the reach of all. The economic order must be so directed as to permit rather than crush the development of responsibility. A liberalism adequate for today will reject not only laissez-faire, but also all forms of social mysticism, such as Folk- worship, State-worship, or Class-Worship. The test of a social order is the quality of the persons whom it nourishes, and the extent to which it elicits the creative energies of individuals.</page></plain_text>
