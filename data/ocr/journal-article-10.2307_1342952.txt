It is as though Augustine would inform us that the more closely we approach the center of distinctively human phenomena-the organ of vision or understanding itself-the less clearly can we resolve the elements of that center as objects. The con- verse of this may not always be true-that where analysis becomes opaque, we can infer that we are looking at the human face, mainly our own-but I suggest that the two sides of this prospect have been true, are true, for the attempt to grasp what style is: the sense of both presence and elusiveness which Augustine finds for time, and a source for that complementarity in the relation between style and the defining features of the self. In examining this relation I do not mean to contest or even to say much about the apparent, if grudging, consensus in the body of recent work which addresses thefact of style. For that consensus, it seems to me, has been shaped by an interest which, although pertinent to the question of what style is, left to itself begs the question. To define style as a This paper was originally presented as a lecture at the Center for Humanities, Wes- leyan University. I am indebted to the participants in the seminar discussion of that lecture and to Helen S. Lang and Paul Shiman for a number of suggestions which I have tried to take into account. 0093-1896/78/0404-0011$02.07 715</page><page sequence="2">716 Berel Lang Style as Instrument, Style as Person "regularity,"' "frequency distribution,"2 or "deviation from a norm"3 is not so much to give an account of style as to isolate symptoms of what such accounts ought to be accounting for: the immediacy of recognition and of understanding which even the glimpse of a drawing or of a line of poetry-like the look on a face-may convey. The reasons for this im- mediacy will emerge only as the question of what style is is projected onto a different axis, and here I shall be attempting that translation into a Kantian or transcendental framework within which the question be- comes how style is possible-what, in other words, is necessary in order that style (and thus, later, stylistic analysis or appreciation) should exist. The answers to such questions, Kant proposes, have the force of principles, assertions with a different function and type of necessity than the occasions which set the questions in motion. In response to these requirements, I shall be arguing towards a principle of style which origi- nates in a redescription of the evidence. I propose that the vocabulary of stylistics is a vocabulary of human, even physiognomic, expression and then infer from that reformulation and the evidence underlying it that the phenomenon of style-what stylistic categories categorize-is made possible by a conceptual protocol of "repetition" which confirms style as a mode of personification and an end in itself rather than, as has more often been held to be the case, an instrumentality supposed to act on behalf of some other purpose. I do not maintain, then, in Buffon's words, as he distinguishes between the individual manners of style and the determinate stuff of style's content, that "the style is the man him- self " but differently and in the end contradictorily, that style also repre- sents the assertion of content-and thus most certainly the man himself.4 1.

The stylus or instrument for incising letters on a tablet comes in its Latinate and again in its English history to designate a quality of what is written and then, more generally, the manner in which any job or work is exe- cuted. What I am proposing-not recommending, but finding in the logic of this development-is a formal conclusion to the metonymy: an extended reference beyond the work and then beyond the quality of the work to the person of the worker himself. But we have to follow a contrast between two conceptual models of style which differ in principle and in the practice that derives from it before this extension becomes plausible. 1. Style as Noun and Adverb The question, How is style possible? assumes the existence of style, and sufficient evidence for this assertion, as well as for determining what it means, appears in the talk about style, in the deployment of stylistic categories. That talk extends in common usage to such attenuated refer- ences as styles in dress, styles of social exchange, life-styles. To limit the discussion, I speak here primarily of artistic style, but it will be clear that the ramifications of the argument extend beyond the arts, indeed be- yond style as well. When we pursue this line of inference, the practical question of what the use or function of stylistic analysis is plays a controlling role and in effect sets a dialectic in motion. For if, as I suggest, there is a stopping short in the first-adverbial or instrumental-model of style and an amending completeness in the second-verbial or transitive-model, that difference starts from their respective conceptions of the function which stylistic analysis and finally style itself serve. It is important, then, to keep the question of function in mind, to allow it to spend its own force; that question serves, in fact, as a mediating link between the ap- pearance of style and the discourse about it, on the one hand, and the final question of how style is possible, on the other. The two models of style to be described differ explicitly on the last of these points, and they differ at least tacitly in their conception of the mediating link, the ques- tion of the function or use of style. Those differences in turn make a practical difference even in the immediate description of particular styles. Consider the following two examples of stylistic criticism which serve as points of reference-the first from Samuel Johnson's Lives of the English Poets, the second from Heinrich Wolfflin's Principles ofArt History: The metaphysical poets were men of learning, and to shew their learning was their whole endeavor; but unluckily resolving to shew it in rhyme, instead of writing poetry they wrote only verse, and</page><page sequence="4">718 Berel Lang Style as Instrument, Style as Person very often such verses as stood the trial of the finger better than of the ear; for the modulation was so imperfect that they were only found to be verses by counting the syllables. . . . Wit, abstracted from its effects upon the hearer, may be more rigorously and philosophically considered as a kind of discordia concors; a combi- nation of dissimilar images, or discovery of occult resemblances in things apparently unlike. Of wit thus defined, they have more than enough.5 The development from the linear to the painterly [styles involves] the development of line as the path of vision and guide of the eye, and the gradual depreciation of line: in more general terms, the perception of the object by its tangible character-in outline and surfaces-on the one hand, and on the other, a perception which is by way of surrendering itself to the mere visual appearance and abandoning "tangible" design. In the former case the stress is laid on the limits of things; in the other the work tends to look limitless. Seeing by volume and outlines isolates objects; for the painterly eye, they merge.6 In the contexts from which these descriptions are taken, it could be shown, I think, that the two accounts reflect different conceptions of what style is. But for the moment, the passages are at the reader's mercy, fragments out of context; thus abstracted, it is what they have in com- mon which is more accessible (if hardly startling)-specifically, to begin with, the function of classification. The concepts of metaphysical poetry and the linear-painterly distinction define categories which may apply beyond the examples actually cited for them (as Eliot showed, for in- stance, in extending the concept of metaphysical poetry as a generic term) but which, even in their original formulations, provide lines of organization whose further use we might well not question. With the advantage of Johnson's notion of the metaphysical in poetry, we make more manageable, set our mark on, an otherwise homogeneous (let us suppose) collection of English poets; W1olfflin's discrimination of the linear and painterly styles, with the other four stylistic pairs which he notices, contributes to a distinction otherwise marked by the unwieldy and (for art) arbitrary line between the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies. At this minimal level, then, the categories serve a naming func- tion. They answer to a version of the Linnean ideal of classification which originates in what may be claimed as a source of language itself: the fact that without it we are restricted to pointing at the individual members of a class (the class, of course, being undiscerned); that once we 5.

This function appears, in the caricatured history of grammar which I propose to relate to the two models of style, as that of the noun; a "nominative" function is thus ascribed to the models of style discussed here (indeed, to any classificatory scheme whatever). This nominative function, moreover, is not merely a prior condition of the other func- tions disclosed in the model of style. Although few theories of style see this first function as exhausting the possibilities of stylistic discourse, stylistic practice itself often goes no further-content only to attach to an object or to its parts the names of a creator, school, period, genre, figure of speech. The act of naming, in such cases, seems an end in itself. The mediating question of use or function, however, is hardly re- solved by this limit. It is evident that most systems and instances of classification-including many that do so only tacitly-reflect broader purposes than that of naming. Classification, although usually a matter of convention, is rarely arbitrary, and one has only to note as examples the varieties of purpose assembled in the literary genres of encyclopedias or cookbooks to recognize how such differences in purpose, reflecting both origins and goals, shape the lines of classification. The instrumental and transitive models of style share also this second-level function; their later divergence reflects what they do, or do not do, with it. By the concept of style as instrument or, grammatically, as adverb, I refer to the use of stylistic categories in characterizing the "how" or the means by which the object that exhibits a stylistic imprint is articulated. This usage presumes on the first function mentioned, of classification: there is some thing prior to or independent of the manner, and the manner or instrumentality qualifying the "thing" then becomes the focus of stylistic analysis. When Johnson, for example, speaks of the versifica- tion of the metaphysical poets, he draws attention to a manner which sets off their poetic process from that of other writers; it is no less clear from W6lfflin's distinction that, at the least, he is speaking about two different ways in which lines can be drawn. What is represented in these dis- tinctions, then, is a version of modality or instrumentality: if we want to understand the effect produced by particular poets or painters, we must look to their means, their instruments. And at first glance, even at sec- ond (certainly after we have had them pointed out to us), the in- struments or devices employed are both readily apparent and distin- guishable from the process itself. This imputed pattern of discrimination between an object and its means is at least superficially sensible. It moves the reader closer to an apparent intention of the analyses of style that have been quoted; in doing this, it seems also to bring him closer to the works or artists to whom the authors of those analyses were addressing themselves. But this appearance of innocence in the representation of style as instrument is</page><page sequence="6">720 Berel Lang Style as Instrument, Style as Person deceptive. For it can be shown that this model and thus the historically dominant tradition in rhetoric and poetics which incorporates it are made possible by a conceptual basis whose own warrant is far from self-evident. It is a fact, in any event, that in most of the early writings on style-in surviving citations from the Sophist Gorgias,7 and, most fully, in Aristotle's work-style is represented as a specific instrumentality by which another more general process is realized. Thus, in the Rhetoric, for instance, Aristotle continues the battle between sons and fathers as he acknowledges-sounding like Plato-that it is easier to formulate a statement in defense of a true thesis than in defense of a false one; but-against Plato-the contrast is held to be manageable, Aristotle im- plying that the difficulty with respect to the defense of falsehood is tactical only-not that an adequate means is not to be found.8 Again, Aristotle suggests that "it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought":9 a distinction here between the "what" and the "as" is assumed. The structure of style in this account is separable from whatever style is the style of: that (apparently) is neutral, in- dependent of stylistic affect. A commonsensical way of understanding this conception of style and its evolution in critical theory into the dichotomy between form and content is suggested by the analogy between the making or appreciation of art, on the one hand, and the articulation of more ordinary actions, on the other. Many individual actions, for example, can be performed in various ways without altering the actions themselves. I walk across the room quickly or slowly, unconsciously or deliberately: the manner does not alter the fact that in each case I have walked across the room. The same pattern of analysis is readily transposed onto the practice of rhetoric, which gives rise historically (as for Gorgias and Aristotle) to the study of style. For the "action" that marks the occasion of rhetoric is evident: persuasion; and the variables which then prescribe alternative versions of an individual rhetorical act-the audience to be persuaded, the specific objections to be overcome-are hardly less distinctive. We understand, moreover, how the required extension might take place from rhetoric to art, especially in that central tradition of aesthetics which conceives of art as imitation and, in particular, within that tradi- tion, as Aristotle himself identifies action as the principle element of poetic imitation. Here again, the implication (as Aristotle draws it) is that a single action may be articulated in several ways. The act of perfor- mance for the work of art does not differ significantly, then, from those of more commonplace actions; the content of an action or group of 7. See Geoffrey S. Kirk and John E.

The manner of the action or work is individual and contingent; it may vary, and we construe from this possi- bility of variation the patterns of style-style thus appearing as a frame which sets off or decorates a central core. Style, to locate it in spatial terms, plays the outside to content's inside. If we look for the basis in Aristotle's own principles which underlies this instrumental or adverbial conception, the relation between it and certain logical and metaphysical doctrines is unmistakable: the parallel and independently consequential lines of rhetoric and metaphysics meet. Two formulations in particular mark this convergence: the subject-predicate distinction on the basis of which Aristotle structures the logic of discourse and the related distinction, developed mainly in the Metaphysics and Physics, between essence and accidental predicates.10 According to those distinctions, for every natural entity (by analogy, for all entities), there is a core or center of which the other qualities of the entity are said to be predicated: Socrates was, but need not have been, snub-nosed, to cite one of Aristotle's favorite examples of accidental predication; what Socrates really was, that is, the capacity for reason (which thus counts as his essence), could have had a nose that was shaped differently and indeed, if we push the point, no nose at all. As Aristotle turns to this account in the analysis of entities or relations as they occur in general, it is not surprising that it should surface when he is speaking specifically about rhetorical structures or that the common formula should persist, by way of Aristotle's influence, both in the history of metaphysics and in the later migrations of the instrumental conception of style. The connections among these several levels, beginning with the conventional practice of stylistic language, moving to the theory of style and, more broadly, to a principle of style, constitute what I earlier alluded to as a conceptual model of style. On this particular model, the adverbial categories of stylistic distinction are asymmetrically related to their objects: they qualify something which does not reciprocally qualify them. They serve, furthermore, to classify artists or their works in the interest primarily of showing how distinctions of manner are made; they thus represent the means or instruments used for realizing an assumed end-not for exhibiting the end or even for defining the relation be- tween it and the means. Style here is an external aspect or manifestation; by implication a range of alternate styles and even, as I have proposed for the logical extreme, no style at all might be fitted to a single object without changing it essentially. Johnson's description of what makes for metaphysical poetry appears in his work titled Lives of the English Poets, and the conjunction in that title of biography and poetry is significant. 10. Cf., eg., Metaphysics, Book Zeta, chaps. 7-9; Physics, bk. 1, chaps. 6-7.</page><page sequence="8">722 Berel Lang Style as Instrument, Style as Person The lives of the poets, in Johnson's own terms, "have" certain characteris- tics, one among which is the making of poetry. There is more than a tacit indication in this manner of speaking of a distinction between two man- ners of being as well: the one, a ground that is determinate in the poet himself; the other, as in the varieties of poetic expression and conven- tion, contingent and casual. In terms of influence, in the history of criticism, poetics, and aesthet- ics, it is clear that this conception of style has been and remains domi- nant. It figures, after Aristotle, in such classical authors as Quintilian and Demetrius and persistently after that as well-for instance, with the criti- cal concerns of the eighteenth century, in such writers as Lord Kames, Buffon, and Crevier. It recurs, furthermore, in many contemporary writers who address the problem of style from an otherwise diverse range of perspectives: in linguists like Enkvist, Rifaterre, and Ullman; in writers on poetics, including the structuralists (among them Levi-Strauss and, to some extent, Jakobson); and in a multitude, almost certainly the majority, of practicing critics." 2. Style as Transitive The durability of the tradition behind it argues that the in- strumental model of style must be taken seriously, that whether we finally accept that model or not, we shall in any event have to take into account the impulse which underlies it. But the fact remains that, finally, the model will not do, that it reveals shortcomings of internal coherence and applicability to the extent that an alternative conception is suggested by its own formulation. These defects become apparent through the mediating question of function, as we ask about the instrumental or adverbial categories applied to style what use they have as they assume a distinction between the means of a process and the process itself. For although style so conceived provides a manner of speaking-in effect, a way of "handling" works of art-when we press the question of what that handling is instrumental for, we note a break in the sequence of argu- ment. We ask what it is that this instrumentality leads to, what its means are predicated of-and although there is always the presumption of an underlying content or center, neither at the conceptual level of principle nor in the practical discourse about style is that center readily discerned. Either the object of which the means are predicated becomes so neutral or ineffectual as to be aesthetically vacuous ("King Lear is a play about 11. So, for example, Stephen Ullmann's statement in Style in the French Novel (Cam- bridge, 1957), which typifies this position: "There can be no question of style unless the speaker or writer has the possibility of choosing between alternate forms of expression. Synonomy, in the widest sense of the term, lies at the root of the whole problem of style" (p. 6).</page><page sequence="9">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 723 suffering"), or, with the abstraction of all predicates, it vanishes entirely. We must, it seems, add to the grammatical syntax of style which so far has relied on nouns and adverbs; and I suggest that this be done in the "verbial" or, less awkwardly, transitive model of style. Consider, for example, W61fflin's description of Velasquez' Infanta Margareta, a painting which he cites as an example of the painterly style: Velasquez had an eye thus attuned to appearance. The dress of his little princess was embroidered in zigzag patterns: what he gives, however, is not the ornamentation in itself, but the shimmering image of the whole. Seen uniformly from a distance, the patterns have lost their distinctness, yet without looking indistinct; we can see perfectly clearly what is meant, but the forms cannot be grasped, they come and go, the high lights of the fabric play over them, and the whole is dominated by the rhythm of the light-waves.12 Superficially, this description might seem adequately rendered in terms of the adverbial model, with its distinction between the elements of con- tent and form. On this account, the subject of the painting, the little princess, would also figure as its theme or "essence"; the qualities as- cribed to the subject, like "indistinctness," "shimmering image," "forms [which] cannot be grasped," would then be the means or instrument by which that constant and assumed center was presented, made apparent. But it is an obvious question whether the "subject" of the painting (the Infanta) can be assumed as its "substance" (to use Dewey's formula- tion)13 and the substance then severed from its properties. A ready test of this claim would be to see what happens to the painting if we envisage it without the qualities which W61fflin distinguishes and infer what, as "essential" to the painting, is left once we do so. The results of this test for Velasquez' painting seem to me unequivocal: as one abstracts the supposedly adverbial qualities-the highlighting of the fabric, the in- distinctness of pattern, the appearance of the little princess-what re- mains without them, as "Infanta herself," lacks even the standing of an abstraction. The range of examples which force similar conclusions covers the extent of stylistic discourse. Whether we single out the stylistic aspects of genre or period, tropes or the figures of poetic diction, it should be evident that when we strip them away-not singly, but (a truer test) together-the essence which was supposed to have remained has also disappeared: the manners or instruments turn out to have been the thing itself. So we might inflect Barthes' metaphors: we find that the apricot has no pit, not because it is an unusual apricot but because it is, after all, an onion.'4 12. W61fflin, pp. 47-48. 13.

Roland Barthes, "Style and Its Image," in Literary Style, p. 10.</page><page sequence="10">724 Berel Lang Style as Instrument, Style as Person This transitivity of manner, the articulation of the work as process, thus establishes a framework for the second model of style. On that model, an intrinsic connection is asserted between the "what" and the "how" of the stylistic object; the two are seen as modalities of a single and common process. So Hegel, for example-for modern aesthetics and criticism, the key figure in pressing this thesis-argues in one summary statement in the Aesthetics that "art does not lay hold of... [a particular] form either because it is simply there or because there is no other. The concrete context itself implies the presence of external and actual ... appearance."'5 Hegel's schematization of this thesis, which traces the history of art through its "symbolic," "classical," and "romantic" phases, need not be the issue here; for even if we limit our examination to particular objects out of their historical contexts, this analysis is compel- ling, and not only because it proposes a remedy for the defects of the adverbial model. The "fit" between form and content as an aesthetic ideal is acknowledged in virtually all the accounts that speak of style at all. There is an important difference, however, between a view of that correlation as accidental or ad hoc, on the one hand, and as determinant, on the other. The significance of Hegel's analysis turns precisely on his claim for a process of reciprocal causality between form and content-a relation of co-determination which nullifies the form-content distinction as an essential mode of analysis and thus contests the basic division of the instrumental model of style. If the line between form and content is denied, the separation between style and some inner core or stuff of which it is the instrumentality or means also collapses. This does not imply that the manner of speaking about the generic appearances of style or of any particular style necessarily changes: the formulations cited earlier-of norms, deviance, coherence-will be no less pertinent as sources for the derivation of principles of style than they would be otherwise. But those definitions by themselves are now shown to be trivial-utterances which only another and external framework can make intelligible. The point is, of course, that unless stylistics is defined as a branch of linguistics or of formal logic (and even then, as some linguists and logicians would object) a compilation of the consistencies or rules and deviations which mark the appearances of style does not in itself establish a ground for either the existence or understanding of style. What is missing is a principle of coherence-a conceptualization which accounts for the stylistic pertinence of the regularities identified, not formally or in their own terms, but by reference to a source which establishes their significance as symbolic; otherwise, style is equated with redundancy or analogy, and the many counter-examples of redundancy or analogy which are not stylistic features-the legs of a centipede, the 15.

The Physiognomy of Style The second, transitive model of style is shaped, then, by the premise that the categories or predicates of style are not auxiliary or accidental features of an otherwise integral object but rather-transitively- precisely those features which determine that integrity for the object or work of art; there is no space between those features and the object or process itself, no internal spirit or power of which style is then a mere instrument. The latter stipulation implies that the analysis either of style as a general feature of art or of a particular artistic style will be a function of the concept of the work of art. I attempt no more here than to acknowledge this connection, and not only because I recognize the dif- ficulty involved in showing what the defining features of art are which then reappear in its stylistic character; if the argument until this point holds, what is important about the relation between art and style is the transitive character of that relation, however we define art or distinguish it from other forms of expression. For the purposes of this discussion, in fact, reference to the expressive character of art, notwithstanding the frequently cited ambiguities in the concept of expression itself, may suffice; recognition of that character seems, in any event, a necessary ingredient for an adequate view of art, and few accounts of art, with the exception of certain ones in the formalist tradition (which suffer from its absence), have even attempted to do without it. Furthermore, although the claim of an intrinsic connection between style and the objects of art is independent of any particular conception of art, a number of consid- erations suggest (although they do not strictly imply) the component of expression as a necessary ingredient in them all. These considerations are embodied in stylistic discourse: in the fact, for example, that stylistic categories are conventionally applied only to artifacts or human actions (we speak of the beauty of a sunset but not, except equivocally, of its style);'16 and that even within the class of ar- tifacts or human predicates, stylistic analysis pertains only to those which are referential or iconic, and thus which are not merely natural (as are fingerprints or voice pitch). A more basic but also more difficult point to establish emerges from the question of what-comparable in linguistic function to the phoneme or morpheme-is the basic or least unit of stylistic analysis. It is clear enough that elements as slight as individual syllables or sounds, brushstrokes, individual musical notes, commas, 16. So, for example, Nelson Goodman's reference to the "Mandalay-sian sunrise" ("The Status of Style," Critical Inquiry 1 [June 1975]: 808), to which, I suppose, one might add Atlantic-ish Oceans and Yorkshire-ish puddings.</page><page sequence="12">726 Berel Lang Style as Instrument, Style as Person even silences or empty spaces turn out to be stylistically pertinent; they are pertinent, however, not in themselves (in themselves they are ele- ments "in" or "of" the artist's style) but insofar as they are seen both to contribute to and to reflect an expressive function. That function may be represented at various levels of magnitude, some of them as slight as those already named, some much larger: through the art work as a whole, through the work as it is placed within the corpus of the artist's work, or as any or all of these are juxtaposed to other art of a period or genre. So terms like "baroque," for example, are applied to units as small as a single line in a drawing and as large as the "spirit" of a historical age. The applicability of stylistic terms at these different levels may not be uniformly justified, but insofar as they are claimed to be justified (and this is the issue here), the claim presupposes a common expressive function which the various levels of complexity are supposed to share; and this suggests, as I argue below in more detail, that the least unit of style, like the least unit of expression, is not any single figure of speech or gesture or statement or emotion (however small or large), but a concept of the person-without whom none of the other expressive designations, what- ever their scope, would be intelligible. We can, to be sure, identify these units without reference to an expressive source; but this would be no different from naming the properties of a leaf or of an ink blot: in none of these cases are we identifying stylistic features. (This proposal may seem to beg the question since it assumes a means for identifying per- sons, but the problems of how that identification occurs are separable at least conceptually and can hardly be addressed here.) This last stipulation of the need for a mirroring or "doubling" effect between the single elements of the object of stylistic analysis and its source recalls the property of consistency or regularity which I earlier mentioned as a common theme in virtually all the recent attempts to describe the fact of style. It may be pertinent, before attempting to locate the principles of the transitive model of style, to look more directly at this property since the evidence for such rule-like consistency (whether as deviation or, more simply, as coherence) is strong and at least sometimes makes fair claim to be an unmistakable mark of style. A Brahms chord, a Picasso line (for examples) are recognizable to the practiced response even if they figure in a work encountered for the first time. This suggests a presence underwriting such recognition either of a single recurrent feature or set of features in each stylistic appearance, or of a "family" of features which exhibit a common genealogy. The former of these alternatives-the recurrence of a single motif, color, syntactical form-is the less significant stylistically and artistically of the two: it is not from mere "sameness" that either artistic value or stylistic quality appears. The consistency or recognizability mentioned is, then, better understood in terms of the second alternative, which involves the concept of stylistic transformation: the movement by the artist from the solution of one</page><page sequence="13">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 727 artistic "problem" (e.g., the rendering of an arm) to the address of another (e.g., the rendering of facial features). It is not, in such cases, that the specific results of the transformation can be predicted be- forehand (although some probability attaches even in this respect)" but that retrospectively, as the viewer of a new artistic "event" reconciles his expectations with the present, a consistency is evident which reflects a common generative principle.'8 We might speak in this sense of a "deep structure" of style as well as (perhaps even more generally than) of language. (Meyer Schapiro has argued that even this transformational consistency is sometimes lacking in style, at least-rather a separate issue-that it is not a necessary condition for art itself.'9 But it is possible, at least with respect to the examples of African art which he cites in this regard, that the supposed inconsistency may be the response of an alien eye. Two other possibilities also obtain with respect to his claim: that the pattern of inconsistency is itself consistent [this would satisfy the condi- tion cited] or, finally, as Schapiro himself argues, that the phenomenon of stylistic inconsistency is actual and basic. In the last case, it would follow that the objects, so far as concerns their internal structures, should not be spoken of in stylistic terms at all. But even if we were to grant this, it need not affect stylistic analysis of the class of which the objects are members, much less the relevance to the concept of style to the phenomenon of regularity. The requirement is that the stylistic ele- ment must be linked to the expressive unit; this link in itself-assuming that the unit which it forms is constant, reiterated-satisfies the stylistic condition of consistency.) The answer to the question of how style is possible on the transitive model must then both take and give account of at least two conditions: first, the regularity or consistency which marks the immediate appear- ance of style; second, at the level of the theory of style, the transitive and, as I have suggested, expressive function to which that consistency is bent. The question is not very different whether it be raised from the view- point of the creator of style or of the viewer who is drawn to it, however we otherwise distinguish between the creation of a style and its recogni- tion: with respect to both, we look for the ground required to explain the adhesive power of style-the basis on which its power of evocation, from creator or viewer, rests. 17. But not the probability that the Austrian architect Adolf Loos attached to it with the claim that "if nothing were left of an extinct race but a single button, I would be able to infer, from the shape of that button, how these people dressed, built their houses, how they lived, what was their religion, their art, their mentality."

These are attempts, in any event, to account, in the nature of a source, for the multiplicity of human activity, for what constitutes person- hood. A principle which responds in the same wayformally to the features of style that have been specified takes both a name and a character from Kierkegaard's description of a principle of "repetition"-the possibility, as he remarks in one of those rare transpositions where language invites conceptual reconstruction, of "recollection not backwards but forwards." "When the Greeks said that all knowledge is recollection, they affirmed that all that is has been; when one says that life is a repetition, one affirms that existence which has been now becomes."20 There is, in Kier- kegaard's reckoning, no inevitability about repetition (nor is there, I have suggested, in the phenomenon or fact of style). What animates the one and then (I would argue) the other as well is the reassertion of a beginning in an open prospect-not the impulse to reiterate a given pattern but to project forward what will be a pattern only retrospectively, with the realization present that this affirmation as well is similarly avail- able to repetition. The results of repetition establish coherence, an iden- tity, but that coherence takes shape only in the agency of the making. And both of these features, located by Kierkegaard as fundamental in the human project, underwrite the restricted phenomenon of style: the consistency in it of one among many alternatives, on the one hand, and the opposing fact that some possibilities remain, even with this con- sistency, quite open-that the consistency is in fact evident only ret- rospectively. Thus, repetition is not an act which follows instrumentally from a source already completed or integral, a means employed; the source is by way of being determined in the act, the determination itself communicating its incompleteness. This connection intrinsic to the human source would explain how it is that style is not something apart from the object of which it is the style; it suggests, furthermore, why the discrimination of style provides not merely a label or moment of iden- tification (as would any pattern which is repetitive backwards) but a means of experiencing, of seeing how, from the inside out, a particular identity is asserted in the first place. The repetition that adheres to style, that identifies it, is thus not the product of a person or of that person's vision, something made by him, but the articulation of the person or vision itself. It may be too much to claim that this principle of repetition by itself can do the work required of a transcendental account of how style is 20. S6ren Kierkegaard, Repetition, trans. Walter Lowrie (Princeton, 1941), p. 34.</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 729 possible; if the connection which I have been claiming between style and person holds, any such account must address the concept of person as well as of style, and the principle of repetition does this only allusively. But the principle at least acknowledges the formal contours required in such an account, providing a basis at once for the distinctive consistency which is the signature of style and for the unpredictability or openness which distinguishes style from either mere redundancy or historical fact. In doing this, it also suggests a means by which the stylistic object would characteristically incorporate the motif of imitation or reduplication so often advanced as the initiating impulse for art itself: style, in effect, is also an imitation, mimetic, but with the large difference from mere replication which the freedom of repetition forwards. In asserting a relation between the process of style and the de- termination of the person, the principle of repetition also takes account of the feature of stylistic categories alluded to above as their an- thropomorphic, even physiognomic, character. When W1olfflin, for example, marks the differences between the linear and the painterly styles, he is on his way to a distinction between the "harmony" or stasis of classical art, on the one hand, and the "movement" of the baroque, on the other;21 without those projections of lived qualities, the categories of the linear and the painterly make sense only as one might mechanically apply out of context any categories whatever (except, of course, that one would be unlikely to). Again, in Johnson's reference to the metaphysical poets-a discrimination which superficially has nothing anthropomor- phic about it-we understand that reference only as he describes the "violence" of those poets in jointing discordant means. So also, to move almost randomly among more recent stylistic accounts and practice, Leonard Meyer's categories of "paraphrase, borrowing, simulation, and modeling,"22 Kenneth Clark's reference to the "severity" of the Greek nude,23 Meyer Schapiro's more deliberate catalogue which begins with colors that are "cool" or "warm," "gay" or "sad" and extends to such com- plex stylistic predicates as "mannerist" or "naturalistic"24--each of these projects either the prospect or the actual experience of a human source. I am uncertain how much to make of these further examples, but it is worth noting that semiotics, one of the strong contemporary influences on stylistic analysis, traces its origins to the work of the Greek physicians for whom diagnosis and prognosis were based on the signs displayed-in a more literal sense, expressed-by their patients.25 21.

Another straw in this same wind-and how many does one need?-is the usage of the Greek KapaYXEp, which from its early designation of the minter of coins or of the mark made by the minter on the coins comes to refer to "feature" or "mien" (e.g., in Theophras- tus) and, in the same expansion, to "style" (although not used as commonly as XEXtS).</page><page sequence="16">730 Berel Lang Style as Instrument, Style as Person This does not mean that stylistic predicates, as they are applied, are exclusively subjective or emotive (although it does imply a constant sub- jective component). As Goodman points out, stylistic predicates often designate what seem to be "objective" properties (for example, the rhyme scheme of a poem).26 The fact remains, however-at least so I am claiming-that these predicates too, however objective, are either explic- itly "named after" or only intelligible in terms of, the shapes of their users. And this is the case notwithstanding the space required in any stylistic schema for at least two other nonexpressive (and thus sub- ordinate) elements: the material properties which may be "implied" as a consequence of initial expressive stylistic choices (so, for example, the buttressing of the Gothic cathedral as a consequence of the height and light proposed in the expressive conception); and, in other instances, the random and thus nonexpressive choices left open also by the initial expressive assertion (so, for example, Levi-Strauss' statement about the expressive function of cultural objects: "To say that everything in a society functions is an absurdity").27 The implication of such argument and evidence, then, amounts to this: in discriminating the features of style, what the viewer does corre- sponds to the process of recognizing persons, and thus the particular style, what he discerns, is both a person and the field of agency or vision of that person which acts on the viewer as he discerns the style. Stylistic categories are characteristically anthropomorphic because what they categorize is itself a human form. (In this sense, to speak of a style as "dead" is more than simply a reference to historical supersession.) Few works of art display this genealogy so openly as do certain of the Byzantine mosaics in which the figures are represented not as seen by an observer, but as looking at him;28 more often the glance of art is oblique or, as Mill said about poetry, it is meant to be not heard but "overheard." But this feature, it seems evident, is a device, a diplomatic gesture or initial modesty, on the part of art belied by the whole. As has so in- sistently been argued in recent philosophical attacks on the influential Cartesian concept of mind as a "ghost in the machine"29-a thinking substance within but separate from the body-so also here: style is not an accretion on the object but rather the object or, more precisely, the subject itself. That subject, moreover, is not merely identified or named in stylistic recognition, since, in the role of cue or symptom, style is one among numerous tell-tale aspects of familiar objects (as also, for exam- 26.

Style, unlike other perceptual cues, also affords a means of intersubjective relation: we see it and we also see by way of it. For a moment, sometimes longer, the viewer himself "looks" (both sees and appears) as the style does; its vision becomes his own. These last comments on the transitive conception of style which relate even the apparently external features of style to the expression not only of the individual creator but of a community that includes at least the viewer as one other member, may seem to exclude only by fiat certain generally admitted instances of stylistic practice. What, for example, of the work of the connoisseur, such as the classical studies of Giovanni Morelli in which he identifies the differences in shape among the ears painted by generations of Renaissance artists?30 Or the accounts of pros- ody in the standard handbooks, as they measure the inches of the poetic foot?31 But it is not self-evident that the placing of such examples by itself can, or is meant to, count as stylistic analysis any more than it would be an exercise in stylistics to attribute a painting by showing from the chemical composition of the paints that they were used only in a particu- lar studio, or to identify a poet's work by its frequency distribution of the comma. We often recognize in such detailed analysis as Morelli's, in fact, a larger intention to show precisely how within a work or series of works the parts constitute the whole, not as a physical object but as expressive; in the absence of that intention, the observer may be searching for items of history or physiology-but not of style. Nor is this, as it might further be objected, the true but trivial claim that any piece of human expression and thus its description will naturally exemplify the human form, define a point of view. For in the centers, certainly in the arts, where we first find and then come to look for style, we encounter vision and the presence of a person, not obliquely or as something which has defied the efforts of its makers to direct our atten- tion elsewhere (as might be argued for the factual drive of the natural sciences or for the concern with abstract structure in mathematics), but because it is precisely the animation of vision itself and the person marked out by it which is, and is meant to be, encountered. 4. Choice and Synonymy in Style It may seem, even in the light of such considerations, that the transi- tive conception of style, as it rejects the form-content distinction and subordinates stylistic categories to the patterns of expression, makes little difference, that it neither proposes a systematic program for stylistic analysis nor makes sense of the many examples of practical criticism 30.

This reservation is incontestable, it seems to me, as it defines the requirements of a technical idiom for applied stylistics; and in fact the primary intention of these comments has been to consider the principles of style rather than its particular appearances. Nonetheless, a number of practical and systematic implications follow from those prin- ciples for the work of analyzing style, and it is important that they be identified in order at least to indicate the connection between the two orders of analysis. One obvious practical requirement in any conception of style is for a means of contrasting the stylistic and nonstylistic features of criticism. Unless all criticism (and then perception) has style as its object (and then style the only object), stylistic terms themselves should reflect the possi- bility of asserting a distinction; and I suggest that this can be done by way of a "spectrum" contrast which marks the relative distance rather than a break between stylistic and nonstylistic terms. Consider the following possible critical statements: 1. The painting is beautiful. 2. The painting is a good example of the baroque. 3. The baroque coloring of the painting is always in movement and is bound up with the impression of becoming. 4. The painting has been claimed to be from the studio of Velasquez, not by Velasquez himself. 5. The painting was completed in 1656. The statements form a spectrum in which the middle one (statement 3) clearly presupposes or exhibits the features that have been linked, in the earlier discussion here, to stylistic discourse. The statements on either side of 3 move progressively away from this determinateness; for although with qualification they might be related to stylistic terms, as they stand they suppress one or another factor in the usual co- determination of those terms. The judgment that a painting is beautiful imposes on the balance of stylistic features a general evaluational cate- gory in the formation of which the observer plays a dominant and, on some accounts of value, an exclusive role; the statement that the painting was completed in 1656 functions almost independently of any critical response. In the latter statement, the role of the observer is put to one side; in the former, the role of the object. It is precisely the co-presence of those two factors and the way in which they act on each other which produces the stylistic reference of the third statement and, in lesser degrees, of the second and fourth. If, as I have suggested, the in- telligibility of any stylistic statement is a function of personification in an object, then those two poles-the person and the body which the person "inhabits"-must at least be recognizable both in the stylistic idiom and</page><page sequence="19">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 733 in its references. It is obvious that other kinds of statements are con- ventionally acknowledged under the heading of criticism; and although it might well be argued that finally the latter, too, presuppose the elements of stylistic judgment for intelligibility as criticism-that is, that stylistic criticism is the ground of all criticism-this larger claim is not required by the terms of the spectrum contrast. The logical structure of stylistic analysis is obliged to take account of what seem to be two basic stylistic facts of life: the possibilities that the same "thing" (content) can be expressed in different ways (styles) and that different "things" can be expressed in the same way. It might ap- pear to follow from the transitive model of style that neither of these "facts" is even possible, that stylistic units not only may differ from each other but are finally incomparable. But it is at least prima facie evident that quite different assertions can be formulated-varying with the occa- sion and audience-in different ways. And if indeed the transitive model implied that these apparent truths were simply mistaken, as is suggested by Croce, for example,32 this might well be a liability in the transitive model which outweighed its relative advantages of coherence. In one minimal sense, to be sure, as Goodman has pointed out,33 even the adverbial model of style must accept limitations on its use of the concept of "sameness." This qualification reflects the strictures identified by various writers in the very concept of synonymy: so, for example, Quine's conclusion that "it is not clear even in principle that it makes sense to think of words and syntax as varying from language to language while the content stays fixed."34 The technical arguments behind this claim are not especially directed to stylistic questions, but they apply there as well as elsewhere and certainly they add weight to the critique advanced here against the instrumental model of style and the claim of that critique that synonymy of content cannot be established simply by abstracting the instruments of communication (if only because of the difficulty of distinguishing between content and instrument). On the other hand, even if we did assume an intrinsic disparity in all translation, that fact might not be practically crucial, since it nonetheless seems to be the case both that one can say quite different things in a manner or "style" which seems roughly common to them all, and that one can also make a single claim in different "ways." When Job, for example, protests that "I know that my redeemer liveth," this is obviously different in meaning from the statement "I doubt that my redeemer liveth," but the gross difference in meaning is hardly equaled, it seems, by any like differences which would otherwise be ascribed to style. Both 32. See Benedetto Croce, Aesthetic, trans. Douglas Ainslee (New York, 1964), pp. 436-58. 33. Goodman, p. 800. 34. W. V. O. Quine, "Meaning and Linguistics," in From a Logical Point of View (New York, 1963), p. 61.</page><page sequence="20">734 Berel Lang Style as Instrument, Style as Person statements differ in interesting ways, furthermore, from Nietzsche's as- sertion that "God is dead." It might seem that, for understanding these differences, the adverbial model makes ready sense: the variables of style and content can be said to appear in the several statements in different proportions-the two Job-like statements differing from each other very much in content but slightly, if at all, in style. Both differ from Nietzsche's in style, furthermore, although only Job's statement that his "redeemer liveth" differs significantly from the latter in content. But although the rendering that the transitive model of style pro- vides of this problem does not afford the direct grasp which the in- strumental model does, its address is finally more penetrating. To argue, for instance, that the difference between Job's statement and "I doubt that my redeemer liveth" is a difference only in content is to assume beforehand that the other elements of the expressive unit (what is not content) are-in this instance, at least-constants. This may be the case, but it is not self-evidently true; and to be in a position to know it to be true requires more than only the knowledge of the respective proposi- tional truth-values (to assert that the latter represent "content" and the other elements "style" is simply to beg the question). On the other hand, if we turn the process of analysis around by first conceiving of these two elements as linked rather than as independent variables, the possibilities of understanding the statements come alive quite differently. Certainly it opens the possibility that the statements themselves are bound (whether stylistically or with respect to content) to their contexts-which is no more than another way of saying that until we understand the statement as a whole, we can hardly expect to speak about its means. To doubt that God exists and to affirm that God exists-if they are expressed in what is superficially the same linguistic "manner"-might well be to express not only two different assertions but (not "also," but "but") two quite differ- ent manners: the difference between jumping for joy and sitting for joy is almost certainly not just the difference between jumping and sitting. This does not mean that expressive units as units are incomparable but that the modalities of comparison and of interpretation are properly applied to the units as wholes, not as divided to begin with. Rather than breaking the expressive unit into style and content to determine what the assertion of the latter is-thus begging the question of what that asser- tion is-the implication of the transitive model is that the unit should be addressed as a whole and then subordinated to analysis in terms of truth or falsity, the emergence from historical origins, stylistic character, and so on. To speak then of certain features of the object as accidental or inessential makes sense because of the framework provided which has openly established what the essential features of the object are to that framework. This is to say in effect that since it often turns out, even if the distinction between them is simply assumed, that "style" and "content"</page><page sequence="21">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 735 overlap, and since we cannot be certain even of those instances where they seem not to, the objects of stylistic judgment should be initially conceived as wholes and then analyzed in terms of the various pertinent modalities which include (in addition to style) truth and other evaluative predicates, practical consequence or origin, and so on. This procedure has the one decisive advantage of implying, for the question of what in any particular case is being affirmed as content, that "style" may be one among the elements in that affirmation. And now if we ask whether different things can be said in the same way or the same thing in differ- ent ways, the burden is clearly laid, within the context of a specific judg- ment, on the formulation of what is meant by "same" and by "thing"; surely that is where the burden belongs. The connection between style and the expressive unit (whether the latter be a single or a corporate person-i.e., a genre, school, period)35 is thus a necessary condition of the identification and understanding as well as of the occurrence of style. This means of formulation also implies that the "choice" of a style- in the sense that a technique or manner of expression is consciously fitted to a supposedly determinate meaning-is not merely a choice about the means to a distinguishable end and is hardly, in fact, a choice at all. For if what is to be expressed is also a function of the vehicle of expression, the latter affects what is expressed; the "choice" of neither is free of the other, and the articulation of the two together is a choice only in the sense that expression itself is. And that sense is equivocal at best for much the same reason that one might hesitate to ascribe creations of the imagination to a process of deliberation or choice. This does not mean, of course, that the expressive function or syntax of a particular style is unintentional or accidental; it means only that, as for art as a whole, the concepts of choice and intention have a special status. The more openly deliberate the "stylistic" choices, in fact-as, for example, in substituting one word or name for another-the less significant the element is stylisti- cally. Nor does this removal of stylistic assertion from the choice among alternative versions imply that style is not in some manner bound to a history, that, as W6olfflin denies, "at any time anything is possible." For again, to speak of a history of style(s) which constrain(s) the present and thus excludes certain possibilities hardly requires that what appears in the present be the result of choice. It is undoubtedly the case, as Gom- brich argues in Art and Illusion, that both perception and artistic tech- niques have histories which shape any specific artistic development, but 35. I do not mean to suggest here either the historical or the logical equivalence among these "persons," or even of the connections among them. Stylistic differences among contemporary art forms, even in a single art form, have often been remarked (cf., e.g., Schapiro, pp. 88-91 and Gombrich, p. 359); and, except on the thesis of history as a unitary process which presents itself at any single moment through a Zeitgeist, there is nothing surprising about this. The surprise in fact is in the other direction: that corporate units exhibit as often as they do the consistent stylistic features of persons.</page><page sequence="22">736 Berel Lang Style as Instrument, Style as Person this is far from saying that the individual development is determined by those histories, either specifically or even within a predictable range of possibilities. As Borges suggests in his story "Pierre Menard," it would undoubtedly be more difficult for a twentieth-century novelist to write Don Quixote for the first time than it was for Cervantes but not, in any logical sense, impossible-and the reason for this is precisely the lack of a determinate repertoire which choice, if it is to be deliberative, would require. Beyond this formal contrast with the instrumental model, the con- ception of style as person provides a number of programmatic directives which I mention without discussion. For one thing, if stylistic analysis necessarily involves reference to the forms of expression, we may assume until we find otherwise that it applies to all the media of expression. I alluded earlier to the common usage of the term "style" in contexts other than that of art, but that usage, as with most expansions in linguistic practice, has been casual and largely unmeditated. Only recently have serious efforts been made to establish the warrant for such extension and to understand its forms-as it applies to the structure of science, for example, in the work of Kuhn and Feyerabend, in Lucien Goldmann's projection of genetic-structural analysis on drama, in Hayden White's critique of historiography.36 This work is still at its beginning, and it seems clear that one cause for its belated appearance has been the con- ceptual passivity (and the influence) of the instrumental model of style in which the content of expression has, as content, been taken for granted. A second programmatic implication follows from this first one: as stylistics is applied to different expressive forms, it will have new sources to draw on for categories of analysis, or at least a new sense of the extent of those sources. A ground, in principle, is thus available for applying stylistic categories customarily identified with one genre of expression to others as well as for deriving new categories from the single and com- mon source which now appears as a map of human expression. I have elsewhere attempted one such extension by reapplying the concept of the point of view, usually associated with the analysis of fiction and the visual arts, to philosophical writing.37 Many other expressive features that have been associated with particular contexts may yet be reapplied: items like intention and will, avoidance or reaction, expectation, lying, examples, mistakes-all (although perhaps not all equally) potential stylistic categories, as they are already actual categories of human ex- pression. In following the applications of these and similar terms we stand to learn as much from style about its source as we usually do by starting with human nature assumed as given. 36. See, e.g., Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago, 1963); Paul Feyerabend, Against Method (London, 1875); Lucien Goldmann, The Hidden God, trans. Philip Thody (New York, 1964); Hayden White, Metahistory (Baltimore, 1973). 37. "Space, Time, and Philosophical Style," Critical Inquiry 2 (Winter 1975): 263-80.</page><page sequence="23">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 737 This relationship, furthermore, is as informative about the past and future of style as it is about the origins of expression (and perhaps with a sharper point, given the current faith in the power, if not the virtue, of technology); one has only to follow the recent career of the term "image" to recognize how the will to control style and the pretense that such control is possible have infected what in the traditional sense of the term would be called moral discourse. The fact of the matter, of course, is quite different: style, as it is linked to expression and finally to the agency of persons, simply, and certainly finally, cannot be manipulated or even anticipated. As there are no handbooks of rules which ensure the quality of a piece of writing or of a painting, there is no technology of style, no set of formulas for creating it. It follows in fact from what I have been saying and from the history of criticism itself that the categories of style are invariably retrospective and open to alternative formulation: we con- ceive them only after the fact and thus find ourselves in the exposition of style always and necessarily lagging behind history-even, perhaps espe- cially, as we attempt to anticipate it. Like expression itself, style is in- trinsically contingent and unpredictable. The only means of accurately predicting any new patterns of style is by creating them, and then, of course, the prediction is quite beside the point. This is not meant to imply that the rhetoric of persuasion or pro- paganda, for example, can never be effective, that political or economic forces may not succeed in constituting and imposing themselves and their styles; it means only that there is no way that they can accomplish this without doing more than they think to-without, in fact, revealing what they are doing. Fascism, to take an extreme.example, is not only, but is at least, a style; seen from that perspective, Mussolini's Rome is separated from Bernini's by more than a period of 300 years: Mussolini's buildings and stadiums reveal as much as anyone has ever said discursive- ly about the vision of fascism, with its indifference to persons, its gross self-assertion. The verbal rhetoric of German fascism, when it referred to the "final solution" (Endl6sung), "special treatment" (Sonder- behandlung), "cleansing" (reinmachen) as means of at once affirming and denying the more precise terms of "murder" or "extermination," did violence to language as well as through it.38 When de Maistre writes that "every individual and national degradation is immediately heralded by a strictly proportional degradation in the language itself," he is mak- ing a general claim about social history. What I have been suggesting is that the two functions which de Maistre joins-the external manner and the content of expression-are not and could not be separate occur- rences. Obviously the "idolatry of style" (Cioran's telling phrase) which sustains so much of the contemporary social structure by the symboliza- 38. See on the topic of political style, and especially in connection with the distortion to which repetition is susceptible, "Style in the Language of Politics," in Harold Lasswell, Nathan Leites, and Associates, Language of Politics (Cambridge, 1965).</page><page sequence="24">738 Berel Lang Style as Instrument, Style as Person tion of power will not be thwarted merely by the implicit communication through style of an aura of consciousness. But that aura, the sense of vision, is one-and a necessary-point from which revision may start, even from within; it is at any rate a characteristic by which social styles (because it is true for all groups and the individuals who make them up as well) inevitably betray themselves. This is true even when, as in the art-medium of advertising, the creators take unusual pains to conceal themselves and their motives in their work.39 Style, it seems, is never pristine, never without historical reference; it never reveals an object without also revealing a genealogy of means. For style, intentionality is destiny. 5. The Practice of Stylistics The question may still be raised, even in the light of such instances of practical exemplification and application, what the systematic advan- tage of the second, transitive model of style is since, as I have acknowl- edged, a good part of what has been said here is also consistent with the claims of the instrumental model. But such commonality is often the case in competing theories; it would be unusual to find two accounts of a significant issue which did not overlap. It is not the similarities that turn out to matter, in fact, but the differences-and they are, in this case, not small. I have suggested, for one thing, that the principles embodied in the two models of style are linked to more general philosophical princi- ples: the connection in Aristotle's thought between the subject-predicate logic and the relation of style to content is one clear example. There may be no necessary connection between the principles underlying con- ceptions of style and those principles which govern conceptions either of nature in general or of human nature in particular. But it is almost certainly more than accidental that the philosophical principles pre- supposed by the latter conceptions are identical in the accounts consid- ered here to those associated with the alternate conceptions of style. This in itself might be taken as evidence for the transitive model of style that has been proposed here as it asserts the connection in objects between their "insides" and their "outsides." Related consequences appear, furthermore, in the practical im- plications of the two models. It seems clear, for example, that the tradi- tion of formalist aesthetics, in such otherwise different writers as Kant and the twentieth-century critic Roger Fry, presupposes an instrumental model of style; and I think it can be shown that the liabilities of the latter model bear directly on the implausibilities and inconsistencies in the 39. See, e.g., Leo Spitzer, "American Advertising Explained as Popular Art," in his A Method of Interpreting Literature (Northhampton, Mass., 1949).</page><page sequence="25">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 739 work of the formalists, both conceptually and in their practical criticism of individual works of art. There is in the recommendation of the transitive model, moreover, an explicit limit assigned to stylistic discourse, in effect a caveat: that the analysis of style will never yield the theoretical science which many of its past practitioners, and no doubt some of its future ones, have hoped for it. This is to say no more than that if the consideration of style is a function of the forms of expression, it can be no more determinate than are those forms; and this in turn implies that the analysis of style will remain, in Aristotle's terms, a practical, not a theoretical science, one in which any conclusions are limited by the indeterminateness, the absence of certainty in the activity of a maker and, more important, in the objects which carry the impress of their makers. The failure to acknowledge the causes of this constraint provides an explanation, I think, for the even- tual frustration of the efforts of the New Criticism in the United States and of much of the recent work of structuralism. Communicants of the Intentionless Fallacy, we might name them. Finally, to be sure, the main point of what I have been saying reflects a purpose which is conceptual rather than programmatic. I have at- tempted to suggest why the question of how style is possible ought to be asked and also to mark a direction in which the answer to it will be found. That the phenomenon of style has a principle of intelligibility is in itself hardly a radical assertion until we notice the accounts which ignore or mistake it. Moreover, even if, as we uncover the principle, it turns out only to confirm the conclusions which all the past analyses of particular styles have reached (this is in fact what confirmation of a principle amounts to), we will in knowing it understand these con- clusions differently from how we would otherwise. Isaac is perplexed, in the epigraph cited at the beginning of this discussion, as he tries to envision the single person composed of Jacob's voice and Esau's hands, but he does not doubt that this project of composition is what he must undertake. How to construct a person or its vision, with the voice or touch or look to which one has access now being only manners of speak- ing about that person or vision, is the project defined by the discrimina- tion of style, and even before that as style is created. The need to under- take this project and the possibility in artifacts that it should be realized are the occasions to which the question How is style possible? is itself a response: what makes it possible.</page></plain_text>
