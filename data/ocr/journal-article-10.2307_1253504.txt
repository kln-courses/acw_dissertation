London: Methuen &amp; Co., I896. IN his introductory chapter Dr. Jevons claims, with characteristic modesty, no more than that his intention is to collect together for the student the principal results of recent anthropological investi- gations, so far as they relate to religious customs and institutions, and "to familiarise him with some of the elementary ideas and some of the commonest topics " of the History of Religion, so as "to prepare him for the study of that history." It need not be said that the author fulfils the intention thus expressed. He does a vast deal more. Taking up the investigation of the evolution of religion where the late Professor Robertson Smith dropped it, and partly availing himself of, and partly controverting, the con- clusions of Mr. Frazer, he enquires on the one hand what pre- ceded totemism in the religious development of the race, and on the other hand how and whence the higher polytheism of the pagan nations and the monotheism of the Hebrews were evolved. The result is a book of absorbing interest, every chapter of which is alive with new and fruitful hypotheses, which must form the basis of future inquiries. To criticise it is an exceedingly difficult task. Not merely is it hard to get far enough away to survey it as a whole, but to follow it into details demands a knowledge as accurate and minute as the author's own; and that is what very few possess. Here we make no pretensions to anything more than such a notice of a few of the points raised in the course of the book as will enable readers to form an idea of its importance as a contribution to anthropological science. Dr. Jevons begins by distinguishing between the natural and supernatural as conceived by primitive man, contending, as we understand, that whatever baffled the expectations and the efforts of man was recognised as supernatural, and that the distinction was clear and sharp from the first. Magic was, the primitive man</page><page sequence="2">64 Reviews. considered, within his power; by it he could control a variety of forces external to himself: hence magic was from the beginning different from, and opposed to, religion. Religion is not derived from magic, nor is magic a convenient term under which a number of survivals of earlier religions may be classed. On the threshold, therefore, we are met by a question which, if decided in the sense advocated by Mr. Jevons, will demand reconsidera- tion of some of the positions that many inquirers have during recent years been disposed to assume. After rendering an admirable account of Taboo, though raising issues which we have no space to mention, the author passes to a discussion of Totemism. Here he contends with great force, and we think successfully, that it is to totemism that we owe civilisation, because the domestication of animals and the culture of grain and fruit originated in totemism, and it is due simply to these that man was enabled to rise out of the hunting stage. " It is totemism alone," he says, "which could have produced that transition from the natural to an artificial basis of subsistence, which is effected by the domestication of plants and animals, and which results in civilisation." The present religious condition of most savage races he ascribes to the disintegration of totemism. Totemism is a stage through which they have passed, but for want of domesticable animals, or from social and political causes, they have not reached that grade of civilisation in which a deve- loped and anthropomorphic polytheism is possible, while on the other hand the social and political influences at work among them have broken up the old totemism. Hence when, from stress of calamity or any other reason, a need for help has arisen beyond that conceived to be afforded by their totems, they have had re- course either to magic or to individual protectors; some of the old totems have perhaps been found powerful in certain direc- tions, and have thus gradually been limited in their powers, be- coming inchoate departmental gods, while often remaining special objects of worship of one family or clan. This appears to afford a satisfactory explanation of problems which must have puzzled all students. Evolution, as Dr. Jevons rightly insists, is not equivalent to progress. The survival of the fittest is not neces- sarily the survival of the highest, but merely of that which best suits the environment; and it as often, perhaps more often, re- sults in decadence than improvement.</page><page sequence="3">Reviews. 65 Good service is rendered, we may remark incidentally, to science by Dr. Jevons' repeated criticism of the use of terms, and by his attempts to define more accurately. Thus, "a god," he says, " is not a supernatural being as such, but one having stated friendly relations with a definite circle of worshippers, originally blood- relations of one another." By applying this definition to the accounts of travellers and missionaries we may often clear up difficulties, of which Dr. Jevons has given us a valuable example in the case of Sasabonsum, a spirit to whom so painstaking an observer as the late Colonel Ellis gave the title of god, with the result of landing himself in perplexity. Another instance of the author's acumen is his criticism of the much-abused terms "fetish " and "fetishism." Henceforth, for all serious students the vague use of these terms will be without excuse; and it will be nothing but a gain to anthropology if they be entirely discarded or at least limited to certain classes of charms and to the system of employing these charms. Let us even carry the principle into the use of the term "charm," which is almost equally vague. It ought to be limited strictly to spoken and written incantations: all other " charms," such as are worn or deposited for luck or pro- tection, are, according to Dr. Jevons' definition, fetishes. One term, however, that he has not disentangled is "Sympa- thetic Magic." It has been lately the custom to label all magic as "sympathetic magic." This is to confuse at least three kinds of magic. First, we have Incantations, in which the object is attained by the use of certain verbal formularies. Next, we have Mimetic Magic. When the savage flaps a blanket to cause a wind to blow, "as the sailor still whistles to bring a whistling gale"; when before going on the warpath or the chase he executes a " dance in which the quarry or the foe are represented as falling before his weapon," to secure success; when water is sprinkled to produce rain; and so forth, all this is not "Sympathetic" but " Mimetic Magic." It is to this kind of magic that the maxim " like produces like " is specially applicable. We should confine the term "Sympathetic Magic " to practices, whether of injury or benefit, upon substances identified with, though in effect detached from, the person (or thing) we intend to reach, practices which are believed directly to affect the person (or thing) aimed at by means of sympathy between him (or it) and the substance actually operated on.

Important as will be the controversies aroused by Dr. Jevons' view of the relations of religion and magic and by his chapters on taboo and totemism, they will be by no means the only ones. But while we cannot here even allude to many of the questions debated, there is one which must not be wholly passed over. In a chapter on Priesthood ably and carefully reasoned he combats the view of the origin of the priest set forth with unrivalled learning in The Golden Bough. Dr. Jevons argues "that in all cases the human 'image' of the god is distinguished from the god [himself], and that the divine spirit must enter the man before he can be the human representative of the god .. Further, the modes of consecration . . . are various, but they can be all traced back to the primitive idea of the sacrificial meal, namely, that it is by participation in the blood of the god that the spirit of the god enters into the worshipper." He therefore looks " to some feature of the ritual of the primitive sacrificial meal" for the solution of the problem; and he finds it in the fact that it is the priest who " deals the first and fatal blow at the victim." But this is to kill the god, and blood-guiltiness attaches to the act. Accordingly the criminal would be immediately slain, but that he drinks of the blood-and drinks first of it, thereby obtaining a greater share of the spirit of the god than his fellows, becoming, in fact, sacro-sanct. All who partake be- come in a measure united to the god. The union, however, does not last for ever: it requires perpetual renewal. Before the period-usually a year-comes round for the next ordi- nary sacrificial meal, the union gradually dissolves, and with it the sacro-sanctity of the priest. Being now unprotected by his sacred character, the penalty which he has incurred by lifting his hand against the god may be-must be-enforced, and the priest must be put to death. He is then killed, not as god, but as the slayer of the god. In time his lease of life would be extended, in consequence of the difficulty of getting any one to act as priest on these terms; or a substitute would be slain; or a mock-death would be undergone. Ultimately the animal slain ceased to be regarded as divine. No penalty attached to the slaughter of a chattel, and the priest became permanently emancipated from the liability to render life for life. This hypothesis has much to re- commend it beyond its ingenuity. It would assuredly obviate many difficulties. Whether it would account for all the facts-for instance, the excessive and long-continued sanctity of the priest-</page><page sequence="5">Reviews. king, or the sanctity of and veneration for human victims, like the Meriah, who are neither priests nor kings-remains for a closer examination by other inquirers. An exposition of savage theories of a future life, including a keen analysis of the Egyptian, the Hindu, and the Pythagorean doctrines of Transmigration, paves the way for an account of the Mysteries, to which are dedicated two of the most interesting and valuable chapters of the book. For collecting and piecing together the scattered notices which half-reveal and half-conceal the subjects, and for pouring over them the unifying and vivifying flood of anthropological learning, few indeed are so well fitted as Dr. Jevons. And he has given us what we might expect: the first fairly complete and trustworthy account of a movement without which, historically speaking, the spread of Christianity would have been impossible. What he has not given us, because it was not within the scope of his work, but what is of prime importance for the student of religions, is the relations of the Mysteries to Chris- tianity. Dr. Anrich's work is useful; but there is yet much to be done before the obscure and difficult questions of these relations can be held to be satisfactorily answered. Into the psychological arguments and theological conclusion of the final chapter it does not become us to enter here. One observa- tion of a general character may be made in bringing to an end this very inadequate notice. The inextricable involution of the pro- blems of religion and civilisation becomes more and more apparent the more we inquire into the past of our race. Dr. Jevons has, of course, recognised this, as every trained anthropologist must, and has been enabled by means of religion to account for important steps in the long progress of humanity. Nor has the converse influence of social and political causes upon religion escaped him. We wish he had made even larger use of considerations quite detached from religion, as religion is apprehended in modern and civilised life. His argument, for example, on the disintegration of totemism would, it seems to us, have been greatly strengthened by considering the influence of mother-right in those communities where, though the kinship is reckoned through females, the father is the head of the family, and a true patriarchate is in course of evolution, or perchance in decay. Moreover, a most important inquiry, and one affecting the very foundations of his system, is, What preceded the recognition by primitive man of kinship, and how did that recognition come about ?
