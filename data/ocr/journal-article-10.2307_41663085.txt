Imperial Treasures of the Shosoin By Bun-ei Tsunoda A native of Japan, Bun-ei Tsunoda was educated at Kyoto University and later taught there and at Do s his ha University. In 1949 he was appointed Associate Professor of Archaeology at Osaka City University. Widely traveled , he is the author of numerous articles and books; of the latter may be mentioned Studien über den Tempel Kokubun-ji (1938) and Introduction to Ancient History ( 1950). He is also editor of the new Japanese archaeological journal , Palaeologia. A RGH AEOLOGISTS ARE ALWAYS SEEKING ANCIENT jLjl treasures underground, and during the last hun- dred years many buried treasures have been discovered that tell us of the glories of the past. But how great would be the archaeologists' amazement and joy to find intact many ancient treasures in an edifice erected more than a thousand years ago! In contrast with objects taken from the earth, most of the treasures would be completely preserved, as if used only yesterday, and artifacts of organic materials, such as lacquer, leather and fiber, documents written on paper, would exist in their original state. One of the rare examples of such preservation is the Shôsôin in Japan. The Shôsôin is situated in the famous city of Nara, an ancient capital (710-784 A.D.) of Japan, about twenty miles east of Osaka. The term shôsô means an important storehouse for government offices or tem- ples, and in signifies a section; therefore shôsôin is a complex of several buildings includ- ing the main storehouse and its be- longings. Although once there were a number of shôsôin , this word is now generally applied to the storehouse of the Buddhist temple T odai-ji, the only surviving example. Its historical importance rests on its collection of about nine thousand objects mainly of the Tempyô period (about 710-780 A.D.) and partly of the Hakuhô period (about 650-710) . More precisely, its historical value is based on these facts: (1) objects of the eighth century are preserved in an edifice erected at the same time, just as if they were canned goods; (2) the artifacts represent the various aspects of the Tempyô culture, including that of ordinary people as well as the court; (3) except for excavated relics, no comparable objects exist today in China, the center of these classical cultures in eastern Asia; (4) they show artistic influences from Central Asia as well as from the Byzantine Empire. Hence, the Shôsôin is of great importance not merely for Japan but for the whole world. The Shôsôin stands in the midst of a grove north- west of the main building, Daibutsuden, of the Todai-ji, the largest temple of the Tempyô period, erected in 752 a.D. by Emperor Shômu (724-749; died 756). It is a large edifice (Figure i), rectangular in plan and with a hip roof, facing south (length, north to south, one hundred and seven feet; width, thirty feet; height, forty feet). The building is constructed in the so-called azekura manner, i.e. the floor is ele- vated eight feet from the ground and supported by forty wooden columns, and the upper structure is di- W inter 1952 211</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2.

Part of a koto (musical instrument with seven strings), lacquered over gold and silver foil decoration (heidatsu). vided into three magazines (northern, central and south- ern) by parallel walls made of triangular beams (Figure 2 ) . Each magazine has two stories and a garret. The century reasons objects for are the several. perfect preservation First, the storehouse of the eighth was century objects are several. First, the storehouse was closed by imperial ordinance and opened by imperial de- cision only for the airing of the objects which were always carefully tended under the strict supervision of the gov- ernment and the temple authority. That Japan has been governed by only one dynasty is even more important. Secondly, the building was well ventilated, owing to the high pile foundation and to the fact that the crevices be- tween the wall beams close when the atmosphere outside is moist and open slightly when it is dry, thus stabilizing the humidity of the interior. Thirdly, the azekura type structure has strong resistance to earthquakes. Although there have been various dangers during the last eleven centuries, thunderbolts, earthquakes, fires and robberies, the Shôsôin fortunately survived and is now under the control of the Department of Imperial Household. The Treasures of the Shôsôin range from 702 a.D. to 141 3, but ninety-five percent of them belong to the Tempyô period. Generally speaking, the Tempyô articles may be divided into three categories: (1) the fine objects used habitually by the Emperor Shômu and contributed to the Todai-ji by the Empress Kômyô after his death; (2) various articles employed in gorgeous ceremonies at the T odai-ji in the mid-eighth century; ( 3 ) maps and documents. Needless to say, the first two categories are primary materials for clarifying the higher culture of the age. The numerous documents contain various census registers, missives of divers offices and dossiers regarding the estates or applications for leave of subordinate officials and constitute, therefore, unique materials for the study of every aspect of the Tempyô culture. How bulky these docu- ments are is shown by the Dai Nippon Komonjo (Corpus of Ancient Documents of Japan , Volumes 1-25, Tokyo 1901- 1940) , which has reáched a total of fifteen thousand pages. The Treasures contain countless objects of all kinds, musical instruments, masks, weapons, armor, playthings, dresses and their ornaments, furniture, receptacles, jewelry, ceremonial im- plements, working tools, Buddhist implements, incense, drugs, scrolls (literature, documents, Buddhist scriptures, etc.), maps and so on. They are really a living encyclopedia of the Tempyô culture. Most astonishing are the splendid musical instruments, furniture, dresses and receptacles.

An excellent cata- logue (Shôsôin Zur oku, 16 volumes, Tokyo 1928-1945) reproduces im- mensely important specimens from the Treasures and attracts scholars and appreciators of fine arts of the whole world. At present the Shôsôin is opened for airing every autumn. On this occasion the Treasures are re- paired, and artists and foreign visitors are permitted to inspect and study them. The these technique artifacts is admirable. employed The in these artifacts is admirable. The metal work shows familiarity with gold and silver marquetry as well as with highly developed casting (Fig- ure 4), filigree and gilding. The complicated and graceful mirror orna- ments are the best proof of the ex- cellent casting (Figures 5 and 6). The importance of lacquering is con- firmed by the prominence of metal lacquer (akin to gold lacquer); and ornaments with oil paints and gold and silver heidatsu came into general use. The heidatsu is the special tech- nique of inlaying gold or silver de- signs in lacquer (Figures 3 and 7). The most attractive ceramics are the glazed wares with delicate coloring in green or yellow mono- chrome as well as in two or three colors. Much glassware is pre- served (Figures 8 and 9) ; among the most val- uable is a beautiful bowl of cut glass (Figure 10). A twelve-lobed mirror with cloisonné back is one of the masterpieces of the Tempy o arts (Fig- ure 11). Both mother- of-pearl and wood mosaic were in vogue; the best examples are on the backs of mirrors or on lutes. We should not ignore the ivory work and the tor- toise-shell wares used in many toilet articles and furnishings. Also promi- nent are the techniques of dyeing and weaving, seen in numerous specimens of brocaded (Figure 12), damask-like and gauzy tissues and decorated car- pets. Worthy of men- tion are the excellent examples of ceremonial dresses, banners, hang- ings and scroll covers woven in finest silk.

That they are typical of the best work of the period is proved by contemporary objects re- cently unearthed there. At the same time, the court artisans in the Tempyô period promptly mastered the foreign tech- niques and manufactured such excellent articles that it is al- most impossible to distinguish them from the imported speci- mens. Although the Tempyô arts were primarily a reflection of the T'ang and were restricted to the court and the govern- ing aristocracy, and also to the Buddhist temples, we cannot help recognizing that in both originality and quality they are comparable with the contemporary arts of China. One should not overlook the less important pieces of pongee and linen cloth which were paid by ordinary people as taxes. The labels attached to them testify to the dates and the names and ad- dresses of the persons who paid them. 214 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 10. (Above) Bowl of brownish cut glass.

IN ancient contrast culture with of Japan the Mediterranean stagnated on world, an archaic the ancient culture of Japan stagnated on an archaic level. The formation of an early classical style, hinted at by the arts of the Asuka period (about 550-650), was cut short by the sudden and deep penetration of the middle classical culture of China, the brilliant T'ang. Japan's leap from the archaic to the middle classical age was the destiny of a backward area situ- ated near a progressive cultural center. Accompanying this cultural change, a centralized government was finally established in the eighth century, with the em- peror ruling as both absolute monarch and priest-king. The Tempyô period is one of the most epoch-mak- ing in Japanese history, with enormous developments in socio-economic organization, communications, sci- ence and education, as well as industry, architecture, fine arts, literature and music. Together with the pre- ceding Hakuhô and the following Jôgan (about 780- 950), the Tempyô culture represents the middle clas- sical period in Japan. As the acceptance and creation of the new culture were so swift, it could not penetrate to the ordinary people. That the culture of the ruling classes was unexpectedly high and bears comparison with the other classical cultures of the world, is pointed out most precisely and vividly by the Imperial Treas- ures of the Shôsôin.
