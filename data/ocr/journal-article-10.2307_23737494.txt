<plain_text><page sequence="1">HENRY ADAMS' BROKEN NECK Harvey Gross Nietzsche was little more than a name to Henry Adams; we have no record that Adams knew Nietzsche's Untimely Meditation On the Use and Disadvantage of History—or that Adams ever read a line of Nietzsche. Yet doubtless he would have recognized himself, with his usual ironic self-depreca tion, as one of Nietzsche's Epigones: a latecomer into the world of Steam and Democracy, congenitally gray-headed and ill equipped to endure frantic years of being a "helpless victim," waiting, as he said in The Education of Henry Adams, to be sent "he knew not where." In his calmer mo ments Adams tells us he was a "consenting, contracting party" to his life and career; but more often the voice of The Education and his letters assumes the inflections of a blackly humorous observer and suffering target of historical forces. It is this persona, hugely present, that shall be the Henry Adams of my consideration. He appears as witness and victim, as malign critic of his age and, of course, as prophet. This persona is projected large over recent literary discus sion, and Adams emerges as something of a culture hero. As a culture hero I intend to regard him. I make no attempt to fathom the other Adams who lurks behind the irritable temper and bitter self-mockery of the letters and the man nered diffidence and outrageously coy understatements of The Education. Adams endured terrible suffering and often gave terrible expression to his suffering; he sustained the dis appointments of his personal life with admirable stoicism— but he also gave the age in which he lived holy and particular hell. One tack is to regard Adams as an American Nietzsche. Such comparison is voluntaristic and rhetorical; Adams had 1 69</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW neither Nietzsche's powerful gift of psychological insight nor his poetic imagination. Nor did Adams have the explosive effect Nietzsche had: he did not influence an entire genera tion and help bring his prophecies to fulfillment. But Adams' personal development, his temperament and style, and his current relevance frequently touch on Nietzsche's life and work. They both served academic tenures. Both did brilliant work in the historical disciplines and declared they were spoiled by an excess of historical knowledge. Both became polemicists against their age. Adams precariously controlled vast currents of interior violence; like Nietzsche he fre quently vented his despair and frustration in extreme state ments. From extremity Nietzsche passed into insanity and finally silence; Adams' later years are disfigured by a hysteri cal advocacy of violence and pathological anti-Semitism. Both hated their century and the supposed cultural squalor, the aesthetic deprivation of democratic existence. They pre dicted (and hoped) that the civilization they so hated would be destroyed in some unnamable cataclysm. And both per fected a literary style of epigrammatic brilliance; reading their books is a journey into mined territory. We are blown up by astonishing insights and prophecies which long ago turned out true. A temperamental similarity shows in their aggressive lit erary style—the style of those whom Edwin Muir calls "pseudo men-of-action." Pseudo men-of-action—Carlyle, Nietzsche, Spengler, and Adams—never leave the study but with hot polemical zeal cheer loudly the brutal behavior of others. They live in a dream of action and history. In his more unbuttoned moments Adams displays a taste for vi carious violence; his letters to Elizabeth Cameron on the Dreyfus Affair portray him a two-fisted partisan of the anti Dreyfusards and a delighted spectator of the Paris riots: "But Zola howled; and the Bourse actually fought—Jews against Gentiles—till the police came in. A good day's work! and rioting too in Havana! and a new outbreak in India! Tiens! ca marche! One can't imagine larks like this every day, to 170</page><page sequence="3">HENRY ADAMS AUG c be sure. ..." I am aware of Adams' heavy-handed ambiva lence. He knows and does not know it is wicked to enjoy vio lence; he cannot resist taking a small boy's pleasure in ob serving the world descend into chaos. He cannot resist (to cite Yvor Winters' In Defense of Reason) the temptation "to be witty rather than intelligent." On such matters as "the anti-Semitic ravings of Drumont" or the innocence of "the howling Jew Dreyfus" Adams prefers irony to understanding, wisecracks to humanity. Like Nietzsche, Adams became a critic and moralist of knowledge. He was a trained and skillful historian and spent long years working at his profession. He made heroic efforts to understand, to see pattern and meaning in the dissolving world of the later nineteenth century. His rage for order led him back to medieval Europe, which he imagined a unified culture with the Blessed Virgin as presiding female deity. He worked hard at a comprehensive theory of history and hoped to discover historical "laws" based on stop-press scientific in formation. The vision of a unified Middle Ages, celebrated in Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres, is a charming dream. Whatever unity Adams discovers is arranged out of carefully selected details. His theory of history, expounded in the post humously published The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma, is framed in crude and confused analogical terms; it is born out of a desperate need for certainty—even if that certainty is apocalypse. His final "philosophy of history" dis covers that historical knowledge is without pattern or ulti mate significance, that history is not knowledge but the brute violence of irrational energies. In Chapter XXV of The Education, he throws in the towel: Satisfied that the sequence of men led to nothing and that the sequence of their society could lead no further, while the mere sequence of thought was chaos, he turned at last to the sequence of force; and thus it happened that, after ten years' pursuit, he found himself lying in the Gallery of Machines at the Great Exposition of 1900, his historical neck broken by the sudden irruption of forces totally new. Adams rejects the value of historical knowledge, rejects 171</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW even the possibility of such knowledge. But the world ex periences vast and terrible changes; something must be be hind the decadence of the French aristocracy, the skulldug gery of bankers and politicians, the disastrous financial panics which threatened to undermine the capital holdings of the Adams family. History may be inscrutable; historical process, however, is reäl and terrifying. Adams no longer regarded history as the informed and informing memory of man; history became the dynamo, the powerhouse of change. Adams felt he must understand not men or events or ideas but the dynamics of a process. Adams' "solution" to the historical riddle founders on the rocks of a stubborn monism; on inability (or unwillingness) to differentiate between nature and history, the material world and the world of ideas and men; and his need for sim ple, immediate answers to complex and long-ranging prob lems. In "The Tendency of History" Adams urges the dis covery of "historical law": You may be sure that four out of five serious students of history who are living today felt they stood on the brink of a great generalization that would reduce all history under a law as clear as the laws which govern the material world. . . . The law was certainly there, and as certainly was in places actually visible, to be touched and handled, as though it were a law of chemistry or physics. No teacher with a spark of imagination or with an idea of scientific method can have helped dreaming of the immortality that would be achieved by the man who should successfully apply Darwin's method to the facts of human history. Two long essays, "A Letter to American Teachers of His tory" and "The Rule of Phase Applied to History," elaborate the questionable thesis that history may be subsumed under natural science. The essays display dilettante scientism and incredible analogic gymnastics; one startling quotation may serve to illustrate Adams' method: The historical inquirer or experimenter. . .may assume, as his starting point, that Thought is a historical substance, analog 1 7 2</page><page sequence="5">HENRY ADAMS ous to an electric current, which obeyed the laws,—whatever they are, —of Phase. The hypothesis is not extravagant. Adams wishes a predictive science of history; as the argu ment unwinds we discover "The Rule of Phase"—indeed all of Adams' theory of history—is not the formulation of scien tific law but its radical opposite: thinly veiled prophetic utterance. Earlier and more restrained, "The Tendency of History" is apprehensive that such a "scientific" law of history should be discovered; Adams is ambivalent toward knowledge that portends only a dismal future. He recognizes the self-fulfill ing nature of prophecy and its peculiar ability to bring about exactly the catastrophes it seeks to avoid. Because his new "science of history" sees only the certain downfall of tradi tional culture, Adams moves back from such knowledge. The world is not ready to hear about the triumph of communism and the overthrow of property. "Would society as now con stituted tolerate the open assertion of a necessity which should affirm its approaching overthrow?" Adams hedges his belief in such a necessity; "The Tend ency of History" was an official communication to the Ameri can Historical Association and it sings the qualified music of academic caution. But in his letters and the posthumous Education, as a private party or a voice from the grave, Adams is hardly restrained about the decadence he every where sees. He discovers Max Nordau's sensational Degen eration (Entartung), a journalistic product of the fin-de siécle, and writes to Charles Milnes Gaskell, "The other day I thought I saw myself, but run mad and howling. I took up a book without noticing its title particularly and read a few pages. Then vertigo seized me, for I thought I must be in venting a book in a dream." He encourages his brother Brooks to write The Law of Civilization and Decay, but carefully disassociates himself; he warns his "idiot brother" to strike his name from the dedication page and declares, "I do not care to monkey with a dynamo." Adams feels there is nothing to be gained in openly telling society what lies in 173</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW wait: what rough beast grows in the womb of the World Spirit. Adams lived to have the dubious satisfaction of knowing his insights and instincts were correct. When the First World War erupted, Bernard Berenson, irritated with Adams' pro phetic tirades, wrote him: "I trust that you are satisfied at last and that all your pessimistic hopes have been fulfilled." Adams did not live to see the end of the war; he died in March 1918. In September 1918 The Education was pub lished and his reputation has steadily grown until he now looms as a major figure in American intellectual history. His restlessness, his neurotic scrupulosity, his frenzied energy di rected toward forcing answers from a silent cosmos suggest that he succumbed to the irrationalism and anarchy he so feared. He was deeply horrified at the breakup of the old order; he consoled himself with hot baths of irony and cold showers of historical theory; he tried to shock himself (and others) with the intensity of his nihilistic utterances and his Tory anarchism. From one angle of vision, his theory of history appears as a massive job of rationalization: an under taking to console and justify himself. Henry Adams never lived in the White House, as did his grandfather and great grandfather; history and its mysterious energies flowed against him. Adams' theory of history, with all its noise and doom, appears vindictive and personal; he seems a man who, not getting the world on his own terms, therefore consigns it to Hell. From another angle of vision, Adams' characterization of historical energy is of crucial importance. The Dynamo and Virgin make no contribution to the philosophy of history; they provide metaphors for the literary imagination and images of new, unfathomable forces in politics and society. They are symptomatic of an emerging mood; they suggest that human behavior is based not on reason or logical en deavor but on instinct and unconscious or pre-conscious mo tivations. Adams then takes his place with Freud and Niet zsche, Bergson and Sorel, and the other new men of the 174</page><page sequence="7">HENRY ADAMS early twentieth century who were rediscovering the irrational component of human thought and action. II Nietzsche's most celebrated parable dramatizes a madman crying out the death of God through the marketplace of the modern world. Opposed to the dead God is the living Di onysius, Nietzsche himself, asserting a radical doctrine of creativity against the life-destroyers of the nineteenth cen tury. The aging Henry Adams, "lying in the gallery of Ma chines at the Great Exposition of 1900, his historical neck broken by the sudden irruption of forces totally new," is an equally dramatic image of the modern existential agony. Opposed to the Dynamo and its pitiless rays of energy was the Virgin: Adams' beloved life symbol, his image of the cre ative principle. Adams' Virgin is no theological abstraction but wholly flesh and blood: maternal and sexual. Adams identifies Her with the divine patroness of Lucretius' De Rerum Natura: Aenaedum genetrix, hominum divumque voluptas alma Venus.... A wit summed up Santayana's ambivalent relationship to Roman Catholicism in this ironic credo: "There is no God and Mary is His Mother." Adams might have similarly ex pressed his idiosyncratic Mariolatry: "God has died and Mary is my mistress." In actuality Adams' fondness for the Virgin expresses a very high estimation of women and a personal suscepti bility. He is most attractive in his excited and tender re sponsiveness to female sexuality. His letters from Samoa and Tahiti are suffused with a flaming erotic awareness that edges close to pornography—if we adhere closely to the standards current in Adams' day. Certainly the delight Adams shows in female nakedness is hardly expected from one, who "brought up among the Puritans knew that sex was sin." Adams came to think otherwise. He castigated American 175</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW life for its prudish refusal to accept the joy and use the power of sexual experience; he recognized, long before D. H. Law rence and Leslie Fiedler, the unhealthy sexlessness of classic American literature. American life was symptomatic; the problem was European, perhaps worldwide. Sexual vitality and creative energy were drying up at the wellsprings of civilization. And the desiccation of sexual life withered the religious impulse; Christianity died as the power of womanly influence diminished before masculine assault. "At times the historian would have been almost willing to maintain that the man had overthrown the Church chiefly because it was feminine," he wrote in The Education. The Virgin, Alma Venus, no longer stood at the world's center; no lines of force emanated from modern woman. The loss of the female prin ciple was a profound cultural deprivation, a grave spiritual sickness. Adams saw everywhere symptoms of a civilization main tained at too severe a cost. The modern world had technology and democracy, widening urbanization and increasing finan cial affluence. For these gifts men paid an overwhelming psychic price. The competitive anxieties of industrial life subverted man's sexuality: "He could not run his machine and a woman too; he must leave her, even though his wife, to find her own way by imitating him." A new race of women workers crowded factories and offices; the birth rate declined rapidly from Victorian plenitude. Adams saw that woman's identity suffered confusion; masculinity and femininity re quired new definitions and the act of love acquired mean ings outside the sphere of children and family. He envisioned a sterile world of sexless men and unhappy, frustrated women. The men worshipped the Dynamo; Adams himself had offered blasphemous prayers: "Before the end, one be gan to pray to it; inherited instinct taught the natural ex pression of man before silent and infinite force." Woman, isolated and driven, denied her sex by unmorally asserting it ("the American woman was of tener surprised at finding her self regarded as sexual"); by competing with men, or by 1 7 6</page><page sequence="9">HENRY ADAMS entering the abyss of mental dislocation. Woman, severed from traditional stabilities, gained equality with her tor mentor and quickly earned the privilege of sharing man's self-conscious anguish. We need only to recall the impotent men and hysterical women of modern literature, avatars of the wounded Fisher King and abandoned Isolde, to find validation for Adams' anxieties. The Fisher King and Hyacinth Girl of The Waste land, Clifford and Connie Chatterley, Jake Barnes and Lady Brett, Detlev Spinell and Gabriele Klöterjahn (of Thomas Mann's Tristan) are sexual cripples: sensitive, injured men who cannot make love; neurotic women, unsatisfied in both deprivation and excess. The loss of the female principle har rows Eliot's vision of urban despair, blackens the towns and landscapes of D. H. Lawrence's prophetic novels, and deso lates the mountain refuges and Venetian seascapes of Hem ingway and Mann. Failure in love is attributed to bourgeois brutality and insensitivity, to a mechanized, impersonal so cial order, and to the sickening catastrophe of world war. "That dirty war," the sympathetic poule remarks to Jake Barnes when he tells her he was hurt in the war. History frustrates the life-giving act of sex. Virgin and Dynamo have often been remarked a grotesque antithesis. "The two symbols . . ." Austin Warren tells us, "are not parallel." The Dynamo is a mechanic fallacy, a per versely modern development of the romantic pathetic fallacy. Nature is no longer anthropomorphic, displaying human feeling and shedding human tears. Rather, nature and man become mechanized like those birds and beasts in animated cartoons who stop with a shrieking of brakes and fly with the noise of airplanes. Adams views history as he views the great machine of the universe noisily running down according to the second law of thermodynamics. But the trouble is not in the universe, it is in ourselves. Dynamo and Virgin are em blematic of human irrational energies; thus Adams finds History and Woman equally unfathomable, impervious to understanding and incapable of explanation. The trouble 177</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW resides underground, below conscious levels. Adams never brings this to explicit formulation, but do not the Dynamo and Virgin represent the eternal polarities of destruction and creation, the human aggressive instinct and the human ca pacity for regeneration? Dynamo and Virgin resemble Freud's immortal antagonists, Thanatos and Eros. And Ad ams must have suspected, as Freud did toward the end of his life, that the "heavenly powers" of destruction and creation originate at the same dark center of the human soul. Ill Adams never suggests a reconciliation of Dynamo and Vir gin. He mentions no possibility of a synthesis which might combine and recombine the antagonist forces. The energies are disparate, remote from each other in time and in mental space; they are equally remote as substances and causes. The Virgin is medieval, human, female, compassionate; the Dyn amo is modern, mechanical, mindless, destructive. The Vir gin is all real substance; her work is that of Eros, "builder of cities." The Dynamo is that metaphysical monster, History; its work is annihilation. Between Dynamo and Virgin there can be no rapprochement, no possibility of fruitful conflict. Virgin and Dynamo have polar attributes, but they do not, cannot, interact. The power of the Virgin ran down and her influence died with the emergence, during the Renaissance, of the modern world. The power of the Dynamo is accelerat ing according to "the law of inverse squares" and will destroy us all. This power is curiously mortal, an emanation of Adams' own dissolving personality. He identified, in his in tensely personal way, the end of his own life with the end of history. (And it might not be irrelevant to note here that the chief prophets of cataclysmic philosophies of history— Carlyle, Spengler, Nietzsche, and Adams himself—were all childless men. Those who have not forged links with the future can speculate with some comfort—and perhaps satis faction—that the world will end with their deaths.) Adams' view of history is anti-dialectical and linear. Un I 7 8</page><page sequence="11">HENRY ADAMS like Hegel, who saw history as an immortal interchange of decay and growth, decline and progress, Adams saw steady decline toward ultimate chaos. Again, unlike Hegel, Adams made no distinction between history and nature. Caught up in the Darwinism and Comtism of his age, he made a des perate subsumption of history under physics. Man and uni verse, action and thought, material causes and spiritual ef fects were lumped together as operating under the same putative law. History, nature, and human personality merged into a single substance impelled by the same energy. If the sun was destined to cool in two million years, this to Adams was an omen of imminent historical disaster. If the laws of thermodynamics foretold a diminution of available energy in the universe, this to Adams meant certain historical ca tastrophe. Hegel noted that history is Spirit (human thought and action) moving through the realm of time; nature is "the development of the Idea in Space." Adams does not dis criminate between nature, which displays cyclical, recurrent, and essentially predictable processes, and history, which dis plays ever-renewed, ever different, cumulative, and spiraling processes. Adams' linear eschatology and his analogical magic with the mathematics of doom issue from the Puritan imagina tion. Adams' involuted, cranky sensibility, which often felt the events of history as personal outrages (or the machina tions of the Jews), is a burden of New England character. His was, as Austin Warren points out, a New England conscience: fussily preoccupied with the state of the soul and dedicated to the pursuit of self-improvement. Adams does not escape Calvinist predestinarianism and its intoxication with types and symbols. Eliot's Gerontion, partly modeled on Adams, cries: "Signs are taken for wonders. 'We would see a sign!' "Nor does Adams escape the New England agony of knowing that men are ordained to walk a certain path yet nevertheless must bear personal responsibility and endure the torments of guilt. Adams again might cry with Geron tion, caught in the Dynamo of historical process and con 179</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW fronted by History's bewildering power to confuse moral issues: "These tears are shaken from the wrath bearing tree." The power of History will destroy us; historical knowledge is at best fragmentary, incomplete; at worst, misleading. Caught in the process, deceived by knowledge: such is Henry Adams' dilemma. All the more agonizing was his conscious ness that a solution to the historical riddle was emotionally acceptable but intellectually unavailable. The Christian phi losophy of history resolved the dilemma: history was a moral drama, a testing of souls in this world; its meaning and di rection became known in the next, in The City of God. But for Henry Adams, God died in the thirteenth century; and history, nature and human personality moved in a straight line to their destined conclusion. l8o</page></plain_text>
