<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS* The Hittite Dictionary of the Oriental Insti- tute of the University of Chicago (CHD). Vol. 3, fasc. 1 (from la-//lai- to -ma). Edited by HANS G. GOTERBOCK and HARRY A. HOFFNER. Chicago: The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, 1980. Pp. xxxi + 96. $9. The simultaneous appearance of major lexi- cographical works is doubtless a sign that the study of a language has achieved certain goals and at the same time is a guarantee of more rapid advances. Through the diversity of their intents and methods, the Hittite dictionaries begun during the 1970s have the aim of per- forming a much-needed service, i.e., the sifting and coordinating of the impressive amount of new data produced by Anatolian studies in the last thirty years.' At such a juncture, scholars can only reserve a warm welcome for this first fascicule of the CHD, which comes to their hands clearly printed and graciously authen- ticated by a handsome seal of Mursili II. Although beginning with the letter "L" instead of "A" may seem unusual, it was an intelligent and generous stratagem-a virtual act of co- operation intended "to avoid immediate over- lap with Annelies Kammenhuber's Hittite- German work" (p. ix). The interested reader will thus have from now on more Hittite entries fully restated and brought up to date; II refer in the first place to the Hethitisches Worterbuch by Friedrich which Annelies Kammen- huber has been rewriting and republishing (HW2) since 1975 (the seven fascicles which have so far appeared go up to atta-) and also to the Hethitisches etymologisches Glossar by Johann Tischler, the pub- lication of which began in 1977. * Permission to reprint a book review printed in this section may be obtained only from the author. and the Chicago team, instead of following in the footsteps of Kammenhuber's Wdrterbuch from "A" to "Z," will move with a greater independence, sometimes behind and some- times ahead of it. Aside from the difference in size, or better, in scale, between the two works, Kammenhuber's background and scientific per- spectives certainly do not coincide with those of her Chicago colleagues. In comparison with the CHD her Wdrterbuch will be necessarily less "cuneiform" and more Indo-European, less cultural and more linguistic. Precisely be- cause of this difference in focus and stress, the alternative offered by the more concise and readable CHD seems valid and timely. More- over, the CHD comes with the most reassuring credentials (see the history of the project out- lined in the Foreword). The workplace is, after all, the same Oriental Institute where the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD) is being brought to completion, and, consequently the CHD will remain linked to that prestigious dictionary by a series of technical and stylistic affinities (p. xv). The scrupulous files of H. Hoffner, the extensive and diversified ex- perience of H. G. GUiterbock, and the un- questionable knowledge of both are further assurances of the success of the work. One can only regret that ill health kept E. Laroche from a more active participation in the project (cf. p. xviii vs. p. ix), since the contribution of an Anatolian philologist and Indo-Europeanist of his stature, not to speak of his expertise as a lexicographer, could hardly be overesti- mated in the scope of such a complex and demanding enterprise. Composing a Hittite dictionary means, in fact, combining linguistic and cultural data gleaned from different milieus (Babylonian, Indo-European, Aegeo-Anatolian, Caucasian, West-Semitic), without thereby compromising the unity and coherence of the 143</page><page sequence="2">144 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Vol. 42, No. 2 work, which ideally should constitute a perfect analogue to the peculiar synthesis and koin6 which the Hittite language and civilization succeeded in being. It also means alternating sections on morphology and syntax with Real- lexikon passages dealing with transhumance (:lapana-), music (lapatali-), and cultic (lah- hura-), and dietetic (lallamuri-) details. Finally, it means confronting a particularly thorny problem: how to date, on the one hand, the physical documents (tablets) and, on the other, the texts which the tablets transmit to us. This can be done only by learning to distinguish original archaic features from the stylistic ar- chaisms of later authors, i.e., by distinguishing archaic texts which a copyist may have more or less consciously updated from more recent texts written by a deliberately archaizing au- thor. The editors, I must say, have shown themselves to be extremely sensitive to this point, furnishing continual information about both the date of the texts (language) and the date of the documents (script) from which the various attestations of a lemma are drawn. The position of the editors as regards the relative chronology of the Hittite corpus is basically that of the Marburg School and hence diverges notably from Kammenhuber's dating (cf. p. xv). Opening the discussion of this first fascicle, one must say immediately that most decisions, even of an external or editorial character, answer precise requirements of economy and clarity and meet with full approval. The wealth of phraseology, the introduction of synonyms and antonyms, and the useful transcription of corresponding Akkadian expressions are all positive features.2 It is also a merit to have streamlined Friedrich's alphabetization scheme (HW), treating iy on a par with i, uw as u, and e as i (pp. xv f.), and furthermore to have renounced "a faddish striving to incorporate the very latest values proposed for Sumerian words" (p. xvii) in the transliteration of ideo- grams. In the citations only the key word is 2 would have liked idiomatic expressions like luzzi iva- and luzzi karp(iya)- (cf. p. 90) to have been noted at the end of the morphological section (i.e., placed in due prominence) and not to have found them simply transcribed in the citations. transliterated (sign by sign), while the words in the context are simply transcribed; at least one example for each different spelling is duly provided. There are, however, some points about which I must frankly express my dis- agreement. 1) In the excerpts cited the en- clitics are not separated but are transcribed in a single block with the word or the accented particle which supports them. Such a proce- dure, all the more disappointing after the lucid transcriptions given by GiUterbock in his UI- likummi (JCS 5 and 6), is neither scientifically nor pedagogically justifiable and will not fa- cilitate the consultation of the work by stu- dents or by scholars in related fields. But we may be certain that Hittitologists too would have preferred that these enclitic particles (so important for grasping the semantics and the syntax of the Hittite sentence) be given due prominence so as to be able to gather them in at a single glance, without being constantly obliged to segment groups which here and there may even require a distracting effort, or worse, give rise to doubts.3 2) The iterative verbal theme in -sk- is not always introduced in a clear and consistent way. In the majority of entries it is given in the final paragraph of the morphological section (cf. for example pp. 1 i and 50 ii), but in other places it is not granted a paragraph of its own (p. 8 i), or its attestations are listed before the participle of the basic verb (p. 69 ii) or even before the middle forms of the latter (p. 13 ii). 3) Matters become worse when we turn to consider the thematic suffix in -ant- shown by various nouns (and some adjectives). This formation, called "ergative" by the editors (a term which will hardly be found to be a sanizzi laman), not- withstanding the fact that it is by far less predictable and productive for nouns than is the iterative suffix for verbs, is treated not as a derived theme, but as a case (cf. pp. 64 i and 88 ii: nom., erg., gen., etc.). The "ergative," however, does not come in a set of two end- ings, as might be believed from this first fas- cicle (sing. -anz [p. 88 ii]/pl. -antes [p. 64 ii] 3 Not to mention that if a printing error is intro- duced into the sequence (as already on p. I I i: Nf.TE- asmaza for -az-ma-za) the reader is at a loss to correct it.</page><page sequence="3">APRIL 1983 BOOK REVIEWS 145 -which are, in fact, "ergative" nominatives); it is fully declined in its turn and when suffixed to neuter nouns entails the passage to common gender. Given these facts, one absolutely can- not present the so-called ergative as a case. If one wishes to avoid new entries and also to limit crossreferences, the attestations of this theme could be given at the end of the mor- phological section of the basic noun entry, retaining for this derivative the treatment ac- corded the iterative.4 4) The third case is still called here and there (through inadvertance, I suppose) dative-locative, but in general it is called simply locative. This innovation must, in my opinion, be rejected out of hand, inas- much as it seems not only inexact and inade- quate from a terminological point of view, but also dangerously misleading for the analysis of Hittite syntax. "Locative" is a restricted and specialized term, and a case so named, when used alone (without preposition or postposi- tion), is supposed to cover at most location and a few temporal expressions. But in Hittite this case has a much more ample and varied field of usage, in which typically dative func- tions play a very important role and, in the case of pronouns and animate nouns, practi- cally rule out possible locative uses of the same. What sense does it make, I wonder, to call ammuk, anzas, -si, -smas, and A NA LUGAL GAL "locatives"? Or can I, without thereby blurring my understanding of the constructions involved, label as "locative" the datives gov- erned by wek-, 'to ask' (n'at du-ni wekmi, 'I will ask the Weather God for it'), or by the verbs of removing and subtraction (arha da-, para dai-, etc.)? If the double label dative- locative, which for me is quite satisfactory, were to annoy someone, he would do better to call the case simply dative, which is certainly the less specific and more inclusive term of the 4 This is already a considerable concession. Once it is admitted that there is a fundamental structural parallelism between the verbal derivatives in -sk-and the nominal derivatives in -ant- (a by- or sub- conjugation vs. a by- or sub-declension), one must not forget that the suffix -ant- is rather less coherent than -sk- on the semantic level as well as from a formal point of view (-ant- but sometimes -anant- [cf. huwallis-anant- 'pine cone']). two, also capable of covering the locative func- tion (as, for example, in Greek). In this con- nection, let us examine what happens when the rection of la(i)-, 'to unbind, detach, etc.,' is analyzed (pp. I ff.). With this verb, the person from whom something is detached or removed is usually in the dative (as also in the Romance languages); if, instead of a person it is a question of surroundings or of a body part, one shifts, understandably, to a genitive con- struction ('to remove the sins of the countries' or 'the screaming of his throat,' p. 3 ii). Into the dative (again as in the Romance languages) also goes the person whose previously bound or enchanted limb is freed or released (unless the well-known appositive construction inter- venes: 'to release him, [his] hair'; p. 3 i). The ablative seems, on the other hand, to be re- served for the bond or spell itself (ishiyalaz; pp. 2 f.). The fact is that 'to free someone from a spell' is not the same pattern as 'free someone's arm' or 'take off someone's shoes', even if in these expressions the same verb may recur (in Hittite, la-, 'undo'), and moreover to call "loc." (p. 4 i) the dative(-locative)s of interest and relation to which Hittite has re- course in the latter instances is to flatten out and falsify the syntactic perspective.5 5) In the verbal entries the possible occurrence of pre- verbs does not receive the attention that one would expect; from this point of view, la(i)- (cf. the list of preverbs given on p. 4 i) unfor- tunately did not remain the model. That kattan lukki/a- (p. 78 i) or menahhanda link- (in addition to the duly noted menahhanda lin- ganu-; p. 71 i) exist is something that we learn almost by chance in reading the citations. 6) In the exposition of longer entries (lala-, 'tongue'; laman, 'name'; lingai-, 'oath'), one notes a certain mixing (but this is almost 5 1 do not consider the translation 'to release [the birds] from the enclosure' given for warpi la- (p. 2 i) to be admissible; this dat.-loc. has nothing in com- mon with the personal dat.-loc. of the preceding patterns. If here we indeed are dealing with two words, as is more probable (and not with a single verb *warpila-), the only recommendable translation is 'to release [the 'treated' birds] into the enclosure' (in order to observe their behavior), with a dat.-loc in allative function.</page><page sequence="4">146 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Vol. 42, No. 2 inevitable) of syntactic criteria (rection and construction) with semantic or contextual cri- teria (denotations and lexical relationships). In certain cases (lala-) the semantic distinc- tions are excessive and overelaborated, with the danger (noted at one point even by the editors; cf. p. 85 i, on lulu) that contextual and situational specializations- be taken for original or even etymological meanings. "L" represents a relatively tranquil section of the Hittite lexicon. Although it includes the terminology of the 'oath' (lingai-, etc.) and such important notions as 'tongue' (lala-), 'name' (laman), 'to release, free' (la-), and 'shine' (luk-, etc.), it does not contain particles (-ma, pp. 91 ff., will be concluded in the next fascicle), postpositions or preverbs, pronouns, or verbal or nominal inflections of particular note or complexity. This naturally does not prevent these first pages from prompting a sustained series of marginal observations. I have listed a certain number of them below, dividing them as far as possible into two groups (I. morphological and syntactic; 11. semantic and lexical). 1.0. The tendency towards a thematic characteriza- tion of certain root verbs by means of suffixes of undoubted meaning can be easily detected. The transitivity of the primitive verb (lak-, 'to overturn, etc.' or lazziya-, 'to set straight, etc.') is thus made clear on a morphological level by the addition of -nu (laknu-) or of -ah/ (Iazzivahh-). For the in- transitives (luk-, 'to become bright'), the suffix -es tends to fill this function (lukkes-). Such regular- izations of the verbal theme are typical of a lan- guage which has reached a late stage of its historical development. 1. 1 (p. 4 i). To say that the object of an action is expressed, in addition to a given case, by the par- ticle -kan does not make much sense in my opinion. It is a little as if one were to say that in Germ. bring das Buch her or in Eng. I have to put up with this the object is expressed also by her or by up along with the direct or indirect object following the verb. An enclitic preverb like -kan (and -z) affects rather the semantics of the verb in question, providing a service which in other Indo-European languages is still entrusted to suffixes (inchoative, perfective, etc.) or solely to a different set of endings (middle- reflexive).6 That -kan has nothing to do with the rection of the verb is demonstrated moreover by the fact that this particle "is not required in the miin clause" (ibid.), where it is certainly not the expres- sion of the object which changes. The sole difference is that the "possibility" envisaged by the hypothe- tical clause does not harmonize with the perfective aspect of the verb expressed or stressed by -kan. 1.2 (p. 8 ii). That lahhivai- is also construed with the allative ('to operate against') does not follow clearly from the three examples adduced sub ?lb. The three toponyms could in fact have been tran- scribed as Akkadograms and consequently inter- preted as accusatives. The first two would then be listed sub $2a (trans. 'make war on, attack'; p. 9 i); the third, the mountain name, should rather be added sub $lc (acc. of extent: 'to march over Mt. Haharwa'), given that 'to attack' (wa/h-) is the verb of the succeeding sentence. To say that lahhivai- is used also with the ablative (in addition to locative7 and direct object [cf. p. 9 ii]), because of the example given on p. 8 i ('or if I send some lord on a campaign from this country . . . '), is to confuse the typical rection of a verb with the normal comple- ments which can always be added to a sentence. In Latin, for example, I may say that servio is used with the dative (servire alicui, gloriae, etc.), but it would be useless or misleading for the purpose of teaching Latin syntax to add that the same verb is also used with the ablative simply because one can have servire bona fide vel sim. Similarly, while the 6 The relation of -z(a) with the middle voice is either one of competition (active voice preceded by -z vs. middle voice) or one of collaboration (active voice vs. middle voice preceded or not by -z). The reflexive form of certain stative verbs, no matter how obtained (i.e., whatever its "etymology" is), may have an inchoative value; cf. Hitt. ses- and Ital. sedere 'to sit' vs. Hitt. -z ses- and Ital. sedersi to sit down'. For other preverbs-from -san to -(a)pa (which sometimes is the non-referential en of Fr. s en aller, while at others it is an en referring to a preceding term ['from, by it'])-the lexico-semantic residue of the form is in general more consistent. 7 If here, by "loc.," a reference to the allatives this syntactic statement would be pertinent. If, on the other hand, (whether real of illusory) of ?lb is intended, the dat.-loc. of the first example (kuedani pidi; still sub ?lIb) is also included in this remark, the objection that we raise apropos of the ablative case holds here too.</page><page sequence="5">APRIL 1983 BOOK REVIEWS 147 editors do not state that lamniya- in the meaning of 'assign (to a place)' governs either the accusative or the dative of the person/thing being assigned (cf. p. 38 ii: ?4a), an ordinary dative of interest in posses- sive function ('no one invokes your names, O gods'; lit. 'to you, [to] the gods, no one invokes the names'), which may be found anywhere, is officially intro- duced into the construction of laman (p. 34 i: $3'). Given that lahhiyai- and walh- are perfect syn- onyms in at least one important meaning ('to at- tack'), also coinciding in the transitive construction, it cannot be excluded that the ideogram RA (for walh-) occasionally covers lahhiyai- too (cf. p. 9 ii). One should consider that ideograms are exposed to the attraction exerted either by homonyms (cf. the extension of ME from dai-, 'to put', to da-, 'to take') or by synonyms.8 1.3 (p. 11). The translation of KUB 14.10 i 16-18 which goes back to Goetze is not completely satis- factory. First, tuekka- (Nf.TE), inasmuch as it is clearly contrasted to 'heart' (i.e., 'soul'), cannot here be a general 'self' or 'person'; it is, more precisely, 'body', the physical part of the human being-just as lahlahhima-, referred to 9A, is 'worry' (i.e., 'men- tal agitation'), while pittuliya-, connected with Ni.TE, must indicate a more physical type of stress ('pros- tration,' 'exhaustion,' vel sim.). Second, the two ablatives (9A-az and Ni.TE-az) do not depend from the following noun in a nominal construction of genitive type ('the worry of [lit. from] my heart', etc.). Both depend rather from the verb (tarh-) and are to be interpreted as ablatives of means: 'But my heart cannot overcome this anguish, nor my body this exhaustion' (lit. 'But with my heart I cannot overcome [such] anguish, and with my body I can- not overcome [such] exhaustion'). 1.4 (p. 18 ii): 'keep one's ear inclined (lagan/para lagan)' or 'well disposed,' towards someone's request or prayer. I do not believe that para should be given the status of an adverb here; it is, more simply, a 8 Homonymic attraction may be felt by an ideo- gram even on a morphological level. The ideogram (GI9) AB 'window' (p. 89 i)- uncomplemented, and with no need of ANA or INA--can also cover the dat.-loc. in addition to the nom.-acc. sing., simply because the dat-loc. sing. in the declension of neuter themes in -ai (luttai-) normally coincides with the sing. direct case. preverb, which occasionally may be used to inten- sify the basic meaning of the verb; cf. Lat. (ex-) porrigere, (ex-)tendere, etc. The anthropological ref- erence to the speakers' observation of "canine or equid ear movement" is certainly pertinent: some idioms and several etymologies of 'hearing' (Gr. dicou, for instance) are indeed founded on this image. It would have been more interesting, how- ever, to call attention to Mesopotamian and West Semitic parallels to this literary metaphor, which in Hittite may have been formed or at least modified by horizontal (i.e., cultural) transmission. 1.5 (p. 19): lakkarwant- should be listed, along with lakkarwa- and lakkarwan-, as a possible stem of the neut. sing. nom.-acc. lakkarwan (SAR). 1.6 (p. 28 i): n'an (uzu) ISARISU anda zikkizzi would be better understood as 'and places his penis in (it)', i.e., in the previously heated tappi-, and not vice versa ('and places it [i.e., the heated tappi-] on/in his penis'). Indeed I do not think that -an refers to tappi-; rather it refers to the initial antuhsa-, following the well-known syntactic pattern (partitive apposition: 'him, [his] penis'). 1.7 (p. 30): lalukkiwant-, 'radiant' (vs. lalukki-, 'to be or become luminous'), is another of the rare verbal adjectives in -want which are to be kept distinct from the normal participles in -ant. H. Kronasser (Etymologie, vol. 3, p. 267) still derives lalukkiwant- from the reconstructed adjective *Ialuk- ki-, thus missing the grammatical category to which this form belongs. The term "verbal adjective" is intended to denote the adjectival derivatives which, though not belonging (yet/anymore) to the conju- gational system, (already/still) gravitate around it. This notion, well-known from Greek grammar (cf. the verbal adjectives in -to6 and -tEoq) can safely be extended to Hittite morphology, with reference to the adjectives in -want derived from verbal stems. 1.8 (p. 55): le is not defined well. Reading this entry one has the impression that between le and natta (cf. Lat. ne and non) there is only a stylistic, or at most, a semantic distinction (strong vs. weak nega- tion), while on the contrary, a clear contrast of a morphosyntactic nature exists between them, with clear parallels in other Indo-European languages (Latin, Greek, Sanskrit). The alternation between imperative and indicative mood, on the other hand, should have been put in diachronic perspective, just because this shaft (le + imperative - le + pres.</page><page sequence="6">148 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Vol. 42, No. 2 indicative) belongs to the history of Hittite syntax; this change is instead presented in a flattened out or even backwards manner (le + pres. indic.; le + imperative). The wavering translations of the Ist person imperative, whether negative or positive (cf. pp. 55 and 69 i), by I want, I shall, or let me, reinforces the suspicion that the value or values of this form have not yet fully been grasped.9 1.9 (p. 61 ii). The peculiar adverbial use of the infinitive liliwaihuwanzi ('quickly'; lit. 'to hasten'), when used with transitive verbs of motion ('to send, take somebody'), should have been noticed. The adverbial value probably derives from a consecutive (and absolute) use of the infinitive ("Send your servants to me quickly" would thus be etymolo- gically "Send your servants to me, so that they hurry"). 1.10 (p. 70 ii). For the translation of KUB 21.42 iv 20-21, we follow von Schuler (Dienstanw., 28) and therefore understand: 'To whichever of the brothers of His Majesty he shall make you swear allegiance-- cast that oath away from you,' or 'cast away that oath (with which) he shall make you swear allegiance to this or that one of His Majesty's brothers'. Kuel ser is indeed equivalent to kuedani(kki) ser, and such a complement indicates-here, as in every other instance-the person to whom allegiance is sworn and not the oath as the editors seem to understand in their puzzling translation.'0 The initial dative (lit. 'to the brothers [of His Majesty]') is an ordinary dative of interest and relation which here takes on the function of a partitive complement. I. 11 (pp. 75-77): luk- A, 'to grow bright, dawn' and lukat, lukkatti/a, etc., 'at dawn, the following morn- ing'. For the verb, in the face of such spellings as lu-uk-ta, lu-uq-qa-ta, lu-kat-ta, lu-uk-kat-ta, and lu- 9 In the three clauses from Huqq. (iv 31-33) given on p. 69 i, 1 do not see a double protasis followed by an apodosis in the imperative; rather I under- stand: 'If you misbehave, I (in retaliation) will harm you' (this being, in fact, the thematic and syntactic pattern of the context); then: 'and (so doing) I, My Majesty, will not sully myself with perjury (i.e., this oath will no longer be able to injure me) in the presence of the gods' (since you, not I, will have broken the covenant). From a stylistic point of view, one can say that the imperative mood gives the last statement the juridical and religious over- tones of an apotropaic formula. 1o 'Cast away the oath with which (kuel [linkiyas] ser?) he shall make you swear allegiance to the brothers of His Majesty!' ug-ga-at-ta (all 3 sing. pres. mid.), one suspects that the scribes intended in all cases to write /lukta/, although taking the trouble to double (on the graphic level) the velar, or the dental, or even both the consonants: lu-uq-q(a)-ta, lu-k(a)t-ta, lu-uk-k(a)t-ta, lu-ug-g(a)-(a)t-ta. For the adverb, the situation is completely different. I do not believe in the etymo- logical split advocated on p. 77 ii; if a noun *lukkat is in any event to be postulated in order to explain lukkatti and presumably lukat, it is better to relate the other byforms as well (lukkatta and lukta) to this same base, rather than to see in them a crystal- lized verb (3 sing. pres. mid. of luk- A). Once the origin of the adverb is disconnected from the verb, the following argument can be constructed. The neuter noun *luk(k)at- ('daybreak', then 'the mor- row') originally derived its oblique cases from a reduced theme *Iukt- (gen. luktas, all. lukta, etc.; cf. tekan, tagnas, 'ground'; laman, lamnas, 'name'), but then also in this instance a thematic leveling would have taken place (cf. the declension of esbar) and produced oblique cases like lukkattas (gen.; see below, 1.12), lukkatta (all.), lukkatti (dat. -loc.). The various forms of the adverb would thus go back to the old and the new allative (lukta and lukkatta), to the new dat.-loc. (lukkatti) and to the direct case (accusative of time) lukat (cf. the alternation, still in adverbial use, between dat.-loc. lamni and acc. lammar, 'immediately', p. 36). At this point one may also acknowledge that the verbal paradigm of luk-A was influenced by the spelling and perhaps also by the pronunciation of the adverbial forms. In other words, the alternation between lukta and lukkatta in the adverb may, after all, have produced in the verb too a phonetic variant lukkatta alongside the original lukta (such a hypothesis would lead us to restore a certain phonetic credibility to the medial -a- which appears in various spellings of the verbal form; see above). 1.12 (p. 77 i). The final citation in the column gives rise to doubts that the translation provided is not sufficient to clear up. To the triple 'tomorrow' of the English rendering there corresponds in the Hittite text not a simple lukkatti/a, but, on the contrary, lukkatta siwattas, lukkattas (-kan) siwatti, and lukkatti siwatti (KUB 36.90 obv. 14, 15, 18). From the second and third expressions, which V. Haas (Der Kult von Nerik, Studia Pohl, vol. 4 [Rome, 1970], pp. 177 and 179) translates as 'bei Tagesan- bruch' and 'am friihen Morgen', practically ignoring</page><page sequence="7">APRIL 1983 BOOK REVIEWS 149 siwatti ('on the day'), the meaning of 'tomorrow' may easily be derived (more lit., 'on the day of tomorrow'). In order to appreciate this outcome, it is sufficient to acknowledge that in both cases lukkatt- depends from siwatt- and that it entered into this construction already in the meaning of 'the morrow', The sole difference between the two occur- rences is the following: in the first, siwatti is pre- ceded by the genitive of *lukkat that we have already taken into account (see above, 1.11); in the latter, 'day' is modified instead by the better-known ad- verbial form, which would have displaced the genitive by linguistic crossing (lukkattas siwatti X lukkatti/a) or by analogy (a syntagm of genitive type is trans- formed into an attributive or appositive syntagm). On the other hand, the translation Haas gives of the first expression (lukkatta siwattas, 'in der Fruihe des Tages' or 'bei Tagesanbruch') is correct, at least etymologically. Here the genitive siwattas seems to depend from lukkatta, which in this expression would have retained its original meaning of 'dawn' ('the dawning of the day'). It is, however, very probable that this first phrase too, following in the tracks of lukkatta/i, had already reached here the secondary meaning of 'tomorrow'. 11.0. Certain semantic universals will be noted at the outset: 1) the adverbial use of lammar, 'small unit of time', then 'instantly' (cf. Ital. ora, Span. ahora, etc.); 2) the passage from 'at dawn' to 'to- morrow' (cf. Eng. tomorrow, Ital. domani) and hence to '(on) the following day' (cf. Eng. on the morrow, Ital. [al]l'indomani); 3) the paraetymologi- cal crossing of (ispantan) laknu-, 'to pass (the night) sleepless' with lukk-(es-), 'to become bright, dawn', resulting in the contaminated form (ispantan) luk- kanu- (p. 76 ii). As far as concerns the semantic calques on a foreign model, we may be certain that lala-, 'tongue', assumed also the values of '(knife) blade' and of '(metal) ingot' (cf. p. 25 i), thus faithfully reproducing the two Akkadian metaphors; similarly, latti- ('tribe' &gt; 'tribe on the march and hence under arms' &gt; 'tribal troops/barbarian auxil- iaries') will not, as an extispicy term (p. 49 i), be considered a Hurrian borrowing but rather a calque of a technical (cultic) denotation present in the Hurrian word for 'tribe' (whatever the latter may have been). 11.1 (p. 7 ii). In lahhi- a synonym of sepikkusta- might perhaps be sought ('Let him become a pin/ needle, and let him be fastened to it/him'). 11.2 (p. 26 i): 'If someone from Lalanda speaks, nu lalattaru! If someone from Wattarwa speaks, nu wattarittaru!' In this pair of figurae (pseudo-) etymo- logicae it is rather improbable that the two verbs untranslated are also "verbs of speech." The impera- tive mood runs counter to this interpretation. Con- necting lala-B with :lalami-, 'list, accounting receipt' (originally passive participle of a Luwian verb lala-), one might venture: 'let it/him be recorded' (the inhabitants of Lalanda would make judicious re- marks) and 'let it/him be discounted/disregarded' (the inhabitants of Wattarwa would only talk non- sense). 11.2 (p. 39 ii): lap- is not 'to glow' but 'to be kin- dled, to catch fire' (cf. its causative lapnu-, 'to kindle', and the sequence lap- + war-, 'to burn' [p. 40 i]). That the participle lapnuwant-, like Ital. acceso, can then also qualify a "loud" color or a gleaming jewel or metal (cf. p. 46) is a perfectly understandable semantic development. 11.4 (p. 43 ii): labarna. In Hattic there existed a verbal base I/tabar-, 'to rule', and a corresponding noun I/tabarna-, 'ruler'. The verb passed into both cuneiform and Hieroglyphic Luwian. In order to write it, in the hieroglyphic system recourse was had to the allograph of the "hare" (tapa-), attaching the "thorn" (Laroche, no. 383) to the "hare" pictogram (Laroche, no. 115) to add the necessary r. Between the name of the rodent and the verb (tapar-, 'to rule') there was in Hieroglyphic Luwian only a paronomastic relation, without any etymological connection. The Hattic common noun (but also prestigious title) tabarna was taken up and used by the Indo-European immigrants as an aristocratic personal name, probably because, at least at the beginning, they believed it to be such (various ex- amples of such misunderstandings [foreign common noun, esp. official title, accepted as proper name] could be mentioned; note Candace). The hypothesis of a misunderstanding is not, however, strictly nec- essary, since common terms designating nobles and rulers have been consciously transformed into proper names (cf. Span. Regina, Imperadriz, Ital. [con]- Tessa, Contessina, etc.). The name Tabarna was borne by an early king and-thanks also to the memory of the ancient indigenous tabarnas (not to speak of the enticing etymology provided by the Luwian verb for 'ruling')-became the traditional designation for the Hittite sovereign. The difference between a liquid (/1/) and-a dental stop (probably</page><page sequence="8">150 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Vol. 42, No. 2 voiced), moreover, at the beginning of a word and at the intersection of two diverse phonological systems, is a feature of very little prominence, for which Indo-European and Anatolian parallels could easily be adduced (cf. Hieroglyphic Luwian "rho- tacism"). This, it seems to me, is the most reason- able organization possible today of the data relative to labarna. 11.5 (p. 44 i). For lapattali(ya)-, 'awakening' might be proposed. 'To the tutelary deity of the Labarna's awakening, to the tutelary deity of the Labarna's getting up' offers a reasonable progression, both from a semantic and a temporal point of view. 11.6 (p. 45 i). It is hardly probable that the plant name lappina- means 'flax' in the sentence cited sub l1 (Huwawa as a flax grower?). The passage seems rather to deal with a plant belonging to the tangled vegetation of the maquis or underbrush. I think it is advisable to distinguish a lappina- A, ('plant'), from a possible lappina- B, 'wick', the latter related to the verb lappinai-, 'to light (a lamp)'. 11.7 (p. 51 i). The expression G iB-la pai ('to go to the left'), said of the nose, supports the interpreta- tion of the tapusa pai- of Mursili's mouth (ais) preferred by Kammenhuber (HW2, 1, p. 49 i: 'Und der Mund ging mir zur Seite/ seitlich' [Murs. Sprachlih]; i.e., the king will have suffered a stroke). 11.8 (p. 61 i). The citation from Ullikummi (Guiter- bock's edition) offers us the opportunity to clarify two points. 1) In this poem, (GIg) ;U.i (i.e., sivattal) can only mean 'sword (blade)'. The simile which describes the birth of the protagonist is in fact based on an anthropomorphic interpretation of the hilt,'" viewed precisely as the upper part of a child (i.e., head and outstretched arms) projecting from the womb: 'He sprang forth from the [mother's] body like a sword (blade) [springs forth from the sheath]'. The same simile is also used when it is a matter of "resheathing" Ullikummi into Upelluri's shoulder, in a kind of second pregnancy (this time, however, of an external type): 'Insert him in Upelluri's right shoulder as [you would sheathe] a sword (blade)'. 2) Throughout this text-as also in the "Kingship in Heaven" myth (cf. ANET, pp. 120 ff.) and even I I This anthropomorphic envisagement of the hilt also underlies the technical meaning of lupanni- ('cap'): 'metal capping (on the pommel of a sword)'; cf. p. 86. more clearly in KUB 36.90 i 12 f.12--dankuis daganzipas indicates not 'the dark earth' but rather 'the Netherworld' and is to be translated thus. Upel- luri is also for clear cosmological reasons a character living in Avernus; remember that Ullikummi, rooted in his shoulder, rises from the bottom of the sea. 11.9 (p. 66 i). 'They will break (arha hullanzi) the seal of the oath' and not 'will nullify(?)'. The verb hullai- is normally used in the meaning of 'to rout, defeat (an army)'; cf. the military denotation of Lat. rumpere, from which come Ital. rotta, Span. derrota, Eng. rout. 11.10 (pp. 61 ff.). It is very probable that, as the editors postulate, the original meaning of liliwant- ('traveling swiftly, etc.') was 'flying'. This adjective might even be the surviving participle of an ancient verb *Iiliwai-, 'to fly', morphologically readjusted to liliwahh- (see above 1.0) in the derived sense of 'to go quickly, hasten'. The Homeric expression "winged words" cannot, however, be associated with Hittite uttar liliwan, 'incumbent, urgent matter'; the Hom- eric attribute is a mere epitheton ornans, while liliwan adds a necessary restrictive qualification to uttar. " The variant liliwanza (p. 62 i), for liliwandus, still modifying 'shoes' (acc. pl. com.), is a strangely syncopated Luwism (starting from the same theme, we should have *liliwandanza), which seems to have undergone the attraction of Hitt. liliwanz(a), nom. sing., com. 11.11 (p. 72 i). On the basis of the two passages available, (MUL) lessalla- '(a celestial phenomenon)' could well mean a 'comet'-and happarnuwatar refer to its 'tail' (HW, p. 54). II. 12 (pp. 73 i and 81 f.). The semantic distinction between luli(ya)- and luliyasha- seems also to hold between Luwian luwaressa/i- and its nominalized genitival adjective luwaressassi-. The basic meanings of luli, 'lake, pond', and 'basin (of a spring)' are 12 'Or if you are in the Netherworld (dankui daganzipi) with your mother Erekigal' (from an evocatio of the Weather-god of Nerik). On the true destination of the dispossessed gods ("Kingship in Heaven"), Ovid's testimony, which undoubtably re- flects an archaic mythological tradition, is still valid (Saturno tenebrosa in Tartara misso; Metam. 1, 113). 13 In order to maintain this connection, one would have to imagine that the Greco-Anatolian predeces- sors of Homer had misunderstood a formula of the indigenous epic through a semantic interpretatio facilior.</page><page sequence="9">APRIL 1983 BOOK REVIEWS 151 suited to luwaressi- (cf. even luwaressian SA [TilL] L.), while the value 'marsh(land)' of luliyashza- would fit luwaressassi- also from an etymological point of view ('pondy [terrain]'). 11.13 (p. 75 i). In the semantics of luk- A one must distinguish the technical and idiomatic meaning ('to dawn', with impersonal construction) from a more general and etymological meaning ('to grow bright- [er]', with overt subject). The two meanings, so distinct semantically as almost to create a case of pseudo-homonymy, are perfectly exemplified, one after the other, in the passage cited sub ?a.
