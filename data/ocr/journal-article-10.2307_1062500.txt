This work illustrates once again the importance of religious observ- ances and sacred time in traditional China. Its appearance should help lay to rest the once justified complaint that China specialists tend to follow orthodox Confucian interpretations which suppress or deny religious concerns. The field is now open for competent work in any area. The Chinese, to use Charles Long's felicitous phrase, are "just folks," and can be understood and studied as such. DANIEL L. OVERMYER University of British Columbia REFLECTIONS ON "ESOTERIC CONFUCIANISM" K'ung-tzu wei-wang-erh-wang-lun [Le paradoxal destin politique de Confucius]. By Lo MENG-TSE. Hong Kong: Bibliotheque asiatique, 1972. Pp. 298. HK $12.00. Paris, Editions champ libre, 1972. In 1972, Bibliotheque asiatique published, in Chinese, Lo Meng- tse'sa K'ung-tzu wei-wang-erh-wang-lunb [Le parodoxal destin politique de Confucius]. As the author himself told it, the manuscript had been on his shelf for ten years. Had it not somehow attracted the attention of the French editor, Rene Vienet, this book might (some may say, should) never see the print. It is a book that most reviewers would pass over because it is not a rational book deserving rational attention. The reason I call attention to it is that it does have an unsettling central thesis. In the history of religious movements, it is not uncommon that the founder was given a more-than-religious, that is, a cosmic-political role, a Messiah or a cosmic-king status. It is not infrequent either that, as the movement evolved and found that it had to accommodate to the political world, it lapsed back into being a merely "religious" movement, minus all the previous trappings and extravagant claims to founding a New World. One generally does not associate this process of "depolitici- zation" with the Confucian tradition. We are told, ad nauseam, that Confucianism was never religious and that it has always been commit- ted to the sociopolitical world. Although Lo-Meng-tse does not put it in so many words, his main thesis is that the millenium dream of Confucius had been sacrificed in a similar process in which Confucianism had become nothing more than the inculcation of submissive civil moralism. The title of his book refers to the old Han rationale that (1) Confucius was a Sage, (2) Yao and Shun were Sages, (3) Yao and Shun were Sage-kings, and ergo (4) Confucius was a Sage-king! Just as Jesus was the Messiah that never conquered by might or Buddha the cosmic king who happened to choose to be the Buddha instead, Confucius-as the Han thesis here modified by Lo goes-was King though "uncrowned." Superscript letters denote characters in Glossary. 89</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Lo's arguments are really a combination of the Han thesis, Sung metaphysics, and a modernist indictment against the civic servility of most Confucians since the Mongul dynasty. Few scholars would take his Han thesis seriously and I cannot help but find his analysis of the spiritual development of Confucius-with fanciful diagrams-smacking too much of Sung speculations. Lo's outlook is not in the mainstream of Western understanding of Confucius. H. G. Creel's modern study, Confucius: The Man and the Myth (New York, 1949), focuses on the "man" himself but Lo is interested in the "myth" surrounding the man, that is the meaning of Confucius in a Sinitic Heilsgeschichte. Perhaps because of Lo's "minority opinion," he has to be heard for his "esoteric" Confucianism had seen better days before. Every generation of Christians and Confucians thinks that it has the more authentic "historical Jesus" or "historical Confucius," and Lo has, in his more objective analysis, at least mapped the change in Confucian fashion. His Confucian indictment against the Confucianism of the Ming-Ch'ing period might be both an acknowledgment of and a corrective to Levenson's pessimism concerning Confucian China and Its Modern Fate (Berkeley, 1968). For such reasons, I will introduce-with com- ments on the side-Lo's general thesis. Actually, as Lo tells it, it was Hu Shih, one of the modern objective scholars, trained in the West, who spoke at one time of Confucius as a Messiah like Jesus. There is a tradition which says that the Master's ancestry went back to the people of Sung , that is, the Yin clan of the Shangd empire that Choue toppled. Jews, conquered by Romans, dreamt of a Messiah to give them their Zion. Confucius therefore could also be embodying the hope of the suppressed Shang people. Chinese calendars do not allow "millenium" (1,000 year cycle) hopes, but Mencian traditions preserved a dream concerning the coming of a true ruler in every 500 years (the "5" had to do with the theory of the Five Elements.) Although Fung Yu-lanf had rejected the Jesus-Confucius comparision and Hu Shih never made much of it, Lo revived this thesis in the book (pp. 11-13). Lo cites those passages in the Analects that attest to Confucius's claim to a knowledge of the Mandate of Heaven (traditionally associated with kingship), his hope to revive the Eastern Chou rulership over a hundred lig (Chinese mile), etc. Most scholars would now concede that the Master did have a sense of calling or mission (mingh)-a man of his untiring energy had to. The question is how literally that calling should be taken. Lo, for one, takes it literally enough to depict the Master's teaching of disciples as his training of a political following! Ultimately the question comes down to what the original historical facts are, what the later historic claims concerning the Master are, and how both are fused even in the Analects. One hopes the kind of investigative expertise that, New Testament scholars applied to the gospels can be duplicated in the study of the Analects. Then we can tell 90</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions the original didache (teachings) of Confucius from the later kerygma (proclamations about Confucius). To some extent that search for the "historical Confucius" had been done in the Ching period, but the problem of Confucius's "Messianic [to be exact, Sage] consciousness"- the old nineteenth-century theological concept that attempts to forge a link between the man Jesus and the "myth" Christ'-remains. I am of the opinion that the "Sage-qua-king" ideology was created after Confucius and that any reference to the sage-kings like Yao, Shun, by the Master himself was later interpolation. Confucius never claimed himself a Sage; he was not even a man born with wisdom, only a man who acquired wisdom through learning. Confucius never envisioned himself, even wishfully, as a king; he always saw himself in the advisory role, imitating the Duke of Chou, his ego-ideal, who was only regent to the crown. In Confucius's time, the imperial ideology remained that of the "Son of Heaven," t'ien-tzu l; the notion of "Sage-king," sheng- wang J, did not as yet exist. That secondary ideology emerged some time between the death of the Master and the arrival on the scene of Mencius.2 My hypothesis is that Mo-tzu had initiated this new ideology. Mo-tzu used "history" as a proof of his political ideal; he found his cultural hero in the legendary Yii by going back in time to Hsia that predates the Chou t'ien-tzus (whose rites Mo-tzu rejected) and the much defamed Shang. To "one-up" the Mohists, the proto-Mencian Confucians selected the ever more primitive legends of Yao and Shun and imitated the Mohist term "Sage," sheng, to describe these kings, wang. Mencius also obliquely put down Yii by associating him with the evil of the hereditary rule of Hsia. Confucius never blamed social evil on the hereditary nature of dynastic rule; chaos to him was due to the lack of conformity to the lik established by the revered Duke of Chou. It was Mencius who put the "root of evil" in "selfish" dynastic rule. Mencius, in a truly revolutionary spirit-in the name of the priority of the people (which he might have owed to Mohism), perpetuated the ideology of "Sages should be Kings" (as they once were). The ch'an- yang ' theory of philosopher-kings voluntary abdication in favor of the virtuous, was then added into the Chou ideology of t'ien-ming, the Mandate of Heaven. In Mencius's new analysis of social ill and his adoration of Confucius, the "myth" of Confucius as a Sage appointed by Heaven in every 500 years began. By Han, the cosmological cycles of t'ien-tzu sheng-wang, son of Heaven Sage-king, ideology was the orthodox view. 1 Having accepted the historian's enterprise, i.e., not to begin with the In- carnation, theologians used the "Messianic or Christ consciousness" to bridge history and christology. Contemporary theology has moved beyond that approach. Therefore, too, perhaps the problem of Confucius's "Sage consciousness" should be rephrased. 2 What is said here and to follow in the paragraph is still hypothetical and requires further investigation. The more traditional view is that Yao and Shun and the ideal of the Sage were part of Confucius's vision. 91</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews By failing to differentiate the sayings of Confucius and the sayings about Confucius, Lo Meng-tse gives us a picture of a Confucius with political ambitions and a warranted sense of t'ien-mingm. That is perhaps more a Mencian view of the Master than the Master's self- perception. So saying, I am not disregarding the myth of Confucius for the reality of the historical man (as modern "objective" scholars tend to do). As Lo demonstrates, the teachings about Confucius were a strong moving force behind "Confucianism." Without the Mencian myth and its variants, the full Confucian tradition would not be. Without the kerygma of the Church, the proclamation that Jesus is the Christ, "orthodox" Christianity would also not be. Lo tried then to "psychoanalyse" Confucius to uncover the structure of his growing "Sage-consciousness." I find his attempt, first, to be as futile as trying to find Jesus's moment of Messianic consciousness, and second, to be a metaphysical exercise in the Sung Neo-Confucian tradition. Lo saw (pp. 127-47) three stages of "mission consciousness": (1) the pre-Confucius tradition where an anthropomorphic Shang-t'in qua Heaven summoned specific Sages to be King, (2) the early Confu- cius's attempt to achieve sagehood through learning until the acquired virtues coincided with the ethical imperatives of a deanthropomorphic Heaven, and (3) the later Confucius whose nature, hsing?, became one with the way, tao, of Heaven; "fate," ming, acts as the one limiting factor (to his virtue and power). I find T'ang Chun-i's discussion on t'ien-ming far more dependable,3 but both Lo and T'ang underlined the peculiarity of Confucian "prophecy" that defies Weberian categories. Max Weber made a sharp or ideal-typal distinction between the ascetic and the mystic. The ascetic responds personally to a thestic Will and becomes thereby an instrument of the divine. The mystic embodies the impersonal Absolute in himself, becoming a vessel of the divine. The Confucian prophet, however, was not called or, rather, not just called- that would be pre-Confucius in Lo's scheme. Rather, the Confucian prophet accumulated enough virtue in order to be recognized by Heaven and became thereby an instrument, a warning bell, and a partner to the divine Will, ming4-this is the second ascetical stage. However, the final stage is a mystical participation with the dynamic movement, tao, of Heaven through one's nature, hsing,5 in which ming as fate 3 T'ang Chun-iap, Chung-kuo che-hsueh yuan-lunaq, vol. 1 (Hongkong, 1966). The section dealing with t'ien-ming has been rendered into English in Philosophy East and West, vol. 11, no. 4, and vol. 12, no. 1 (January-April 1962). 4 This is based on the Chinese concept of t'ien-jen kan-yinar, stimulus and response between Heaven and man: the virtue of man stimulates Heaven to respond accordingly. Strictly speaking then, the Confucian prophecy is not purely passive like the Weberian conception of prophecy as emissary prophecy, but incorporates elements of exemplary prophecy. On this issue, see Max Weber, The Sociology of Religion (Boston, 1963), and Harold H. Rowley, Prophetic Religion in Ancient China and Israel (London, 1956). 5 The alignment of one's nature, hsing, with Heaven is largely Mencian. 92</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions becomes the limiting factor (to human freedom in history).6 The mystic mode, however, does not exclude but subsumes the ascetic mode. The pure Weberian ideal-typal ascetic, from the Confucian point of view, is a mystic manque (French for a failure to be a mystic) or a headstrong man who does not recognize the contingencies of the situation (ming, fate). The part of Lo's book that I find interesting and useful is his resume (pp. 199-296) of the history of the depoliticization of Confucianism. Lo covered old grounds in a zealous style, revealing a much ignored literati tradition of "the Imitation of Confucius" and showing the dilemma of ethics versus politics. The most "religio-political" inter- pretation of the Master was found in Han. Han ideologue, in trying to legitimatize the Han rule, depicted the Master as the uncrowned king of the "black" element that ruled over the "kingdom" of the spring and autumn period. His rule was demonstrated through his Spring and Autumn Annuals (the one text Confucius was though to have "authored"). In this work, the Master passed judgment on political events and thereby set up a "casebook" for ethical conduct.7 The Master also "edited" the classics, known as chingP, and established rituals in his "prophetic" role as the man who established the (ritual) rule for the Han empire. The weiq companion texts to the ching were used as omenological guidelines. Much of the above style of scholar- ship, based on the New Script texts, was displaced later by the demythologized style of the Old Script school.8 Wang Mangr, who usurped the Han throne and founded his new dynasty (A.D. 9-23), undermined the credibility of political yin-yangs Confucianism. Nevertheless, the sheng-wang ideal of voluntary abdica- tion, ch'an-jang, was "realized" in the dynastic turnover. Wang Mang also "establishred] rituals and music." All these look to us like a charade but it is significant that there were ten more cases of ch'an-jang until the Sung dynasty. Then in Sung, that hypocritical ritual "went out of fashion," for reasons that I will suggest later. The fact remains that the mystique of the Master as Sage-ruler could not be 6 Ming is the word for Mandate (of Heaven) as well as for fate. In the Chinese language, (divine) providence, ethical imperative, and (blind) fate are expressed by the same term, ming. To know one's ming therefore implies a response to the Will of Heaven and a stoic acceptance of divine providence as fate. In the context here, Lo might be contrasting the pair hsing and ming, what often come out as "essential freedom" and "existential necessity" of the human condition. 7 There is a strong tradition in Confucianism to base human conduct not on purely abstract principles but on historical precedences or case studies. The cryptic lines in the Annuals were regarded as guidelines for moral conduct by the state. The history of Confucianism saw a shift in the focus placed on the standard set of Confucian works: the historical Annuals and the five classics were central in Han; political reformers always turn to the Chou Lias for inspiration; the Sung masters canonized the Four Books as their self-cultivation texts instead. 8 Thus the picture of the "historical," and "humane" Confucius, presented by the Old Script school, dominated China until the revival of the New Script text by Kang Yu-wei for his political reform. 93</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews ignored easily at that time. Similarly, as Anna Seidel has shown in her study, the countermystique of Lao-tzu as the cosmic king to reappear remained powerful throughout the six Dynasties period9 and down to very recent times Buddhism, provided other counterideologies for the peasant rebels.10 Han fell finally in 220 through another charade of "bloodless" ch'an-yang abdication in favor of the Wei ruler. Under Wei, Neo-Taoism, hsiian-hsiieht, flourished. The Neo-Taoists are now generally apprec- iated for their aesthetical individualism, but Lo, I think is correct in pointing out the political side of these figures. The Neo-Taoist dis- enchantment with ming-chiaou, the Confucian teachings of names, was an inevitable reaction to the hypocrisy of ch'an-yang. The Neo-Taoist spoke instead of "inner sage, outer kingship" (from the Chuang-tzu) as the highest ideal. There was also a subtle denial of the old t'ien-ming ideology, for Neo-Taoism revived the old alliance between Taoism and legalism, both of which flourished under Ts'ao-ts'aov.11 Taoist-legalist politics had, as its cosmic point of reference, the more progressive norm of the naturalistic Tao and not the old traditions and omens of the voluntaristic Heaven. The best expression of the Taoist-legalist synthesis is found in this line: "Those above should be wu-shihw, that is, con- ducting themselves as if there are no state affairs [Taoist style]; those managing subordinates should know how to yung-chix, that is, exercise political expedience [legalist style.]"12 In Wang Pi'sY meta- physics, "nonbeing is substance; being is function." In Wang Pi's politics, "the ruler is substance; his ministers function." The formula- inner sage, outer king-was not therefore a popularist but rather an elitist formula, very unlike the Sung appropriation of it for all people.13 9 Anna K. Seidel, "The Image of the Perfect Ruler in Early Taoist Messianism: Lao-tzu and Li Hungat," History of Religions 9, nos. 2-3 (November-February 1969-70): 216-47. Seidel planned to trace later Messianic ideology surrounding Li Hung, but my guess is that the hsien-chengau, "genii politics," probably de- clined after T'ang, in quantity. See my book review article, "Toward a Periodiza- tion of the Taoist Religion," History of Religions, vol. 16, no. 1 (August 1976), however, for qualifications. 10 Daniel Overmyer's Folk Buddhist Religion, East Asian Series (Cambridge, Mass., 1976) seems to substantiate this point. 11 See studies on this period by Mou Tsung-shanav, Tsai-hsing yii hsiian-liaw (Hongkong, 1962). The ties of Neo-Taoists with political cliques have been under- lined especially by the Marxist scholars. 12 Early Buddhism, in borrowing Taoist vocabularies, was incorporating also some Taoist-legalistic terms like ch'isanax, expediency or the ability to use (political) power for the Sanskrit upaya. Graham McQueen (Harvard) has pointed this out to me. The terms cited here, wu-shih and yung-chi, were to appear later in Zen, especially in Lin-chi Ch'an: the man of wisdom should have few or no ado, wu-shih, i.e., be not assertive (in a more determined way than the Taoist wu-weiaY), and he should know how to utilize all the moments that can be "triggered" off the experience of enlightenment. 13 The dictum, "inner sage, outer king," was applied to a rare handful in the Neo-Taoist system; none of the Neo-Taoists, as far as I know, claimed this status. However, in Neo-Confucianism, this dictum was aligned with three others: (1) the t'ien-ming, according to the Doctrine of the Mean, is in every man as his hsing, nature; (2) the purpose of learning, says Chu Hsi, is to become a sage; and (3), later, under the left-wing Wang Yang-ming followings, every man is already a 94</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions The T'ang dynasty was mediating the Han and the Sung styles. On one hand, the Han mystique of the Master as a political reformer who instituted the rites for a dynasty was kept alive. Wang T'ungz, for example, regarded himself a sage like Confucius. He modeled himself, a la Confucius, by writing his own analects and by imitating the style of the Six Classics. On the other hand, Han Yiiaa (786-824) anticipated the Sung Neo-Confucian reinterpretation of the status of Confucius as Sage. Han Yii said, "Those above [the regent] the Duke of Chou are kings; those below the Duke [and that traditionally includes Con- fucius] are ministers." For Han Yii, the myth-reality of the Master as the uncrowned king on par with historic rulers was receding. Confucius was appreciated as a servant of the state. T'ang emperor, Kao-tsungab, might have called the Master "the former Master," or "the great Teacher," in due reverence, but as Lo sees it, Confucius was then more Sage than King. In the Sung period, Mencius was discovered. Previously neglected, Mencius was eventually set up as the "second Sage" next to Confucius. Wang An-shihac (1021-86) regarded himself Mencius "reborn," and initiated his reform basing himself on the sacred Chou Li. The Confucian revival, however, favored the more passive and metaphysical strand that finally culminated in Chu Hsiad (1130-1200). The Chu Hsi school proposed a new theory, called Tao-t'ung, the transmission of the Tao (not through the kings but) from Confucius, through Mencius, Han Yu, and the northern Sung masters down to Chu Hsi himself. Lo regards this to be a Hsin-hsing wang-kuoae, the imperial realm of mind and nature, and evaluated this spiritual kingdom positively as a new challenge to secular authority. I would like to elaborate on these "two kingdoms". Like Luther's two kingdoms theory, the Neo-Confucian dissociated the Tao-tungaf from the cheng-tungag (the transmission of rule).14 The two tungs were one in the Han system of Tung Chung-shu; the emperor was then priest and king. The new philosophy was originally not meant to help the "Tao-less" king. Thus it was not surprising that the Sung government tried, at first, to ban Chu Hsi's heretic teachings. However, sage because of his innate goodness. The first put t'ien-ming within the reach of all men. The second (a controversial point at one time because to the traditionalist one does not and cannot "produce" sages just by learning) made the acquisition of sagehood available through common means. The third and the last, the most liberal understanding, allowed the availability of sagehood to even farmers in the field, illiterate people who never were "educated." I personally think that these are the surviving aspects of the Confucian faith with a future. Institutional Confucianism, like the institutional church, might meet a sad "modern fate" (Levenson's term), but the Confucian spirit, like the Christian faith, is "larger" than the institution. 14 This does not mean that Chu Hsi recognized the historical dynasties to be legitimate; in fact, Chu Hsi hardly considered any dynasty since Han to embody the T'ien-ming, as pointed out to me by Hoyt Tillman (Harvard). A chapter of Tillman's thesis will appear as an article in a forthcoming issue of the Journal for Chinese Philosophy (1976) devoted to Chu Hsi studies. 95</page><page sequence="8">Book Reviews the Tao-tung theory also "helped" to liberate politics from "religious," that is, Confucian ontocratic, sanctions. Politics was (to borrow a Weberian term) "rationalized" in the post-Sung period.15 It was there- fore no accident, in my opinion, that the ch'an-jang charade was per- formed historically for the last time in Sung. After Sung, secular- mined rulers did not have to apologize to Yao and Shun for what they had was legitimate cheng-t'ung. Similarly, I think the last case of an emperor who died, seeking for immortality, was in Ming: kings knew then that they should not be more than just kings. In the Sung period, Confucius was known as the "Hsiian-sheng wen-hsiian wangah," the August Sage and Civilizing King, but it was, says Lo, more wen (culture) than wang (king). The foreign rule of Mongols dealt a blow to Confucianism. The Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) was the first dynasty that did not have to stoop to the ideological power of the literati bureaucracy established since Han.l6 The juai, scholar, was classified as barely above the lowest of the ten classes, the beggars and prostitutes. Although the Emperors nominally revered the Master, the brand of Confucianism introduced to them was that Yao and Shun were lofty beings; Confucius and Mencius were lower but still higher than the Sung masters. This undermined the Chu Hsi's idea of the "intact" Tao-t'ung, and relegated the present masters even lower in the sage scale. The Ming and Ch'ing dynasties, outwardly supporters of Confucianism, actually learned the "iron hand" politics of Yuan.l7 Confucius was then popularly known as "the Master"-a term we inherit. He was the "Highest Sage and Former Teacher," "Master and Paradigm for Ten Thousand Years," "Tutor to a Hundred Kings," whereas in fact, says Lo, he had been remade into nothing more than "the teacher of the three pillars and the five norms," civic morality that was ultimately submissive and servile in the new despotic states. Then was the beginning of the "white-faced scholar," who was pai-wu i-yungaj, utterly useless, a bookworm, seeking to pass 15 See Weber (n. 4 above). The Weberian thesis is that a universal religion could effectively free politics from the ritual particularism of ancient traditions. Christianity accomplished that for the West and, I think, Buddhism and Sung Confucianism had done the same for the East. 16 The psychological impact of a China totally ruled by "barbarians" was probably traumatic. Like the Muslim invasion of India, the conquered culture "freezed" itself. In India, the caste line hardened; in China, there was an anti- quarian drive to preserve tradition. 17 The despotism of Ming and Ching institutions is well known. The laws and decrees against religious movements were much harsher, more detailed, and rationally and systematically implemented. The same political rationality mani- fested itself in conscious "manipulations" and control of orthodox religions or values by bringing, not in an impious way, Confucian moralism down to the people. The ancient and medieval elitism, which considered li (rituals) inappro- piate for the uncultured masses, was reversed. The effects were ambiguous. China was never more Confucian but she was never as submissive and orthodox conscious either. This picture should be read with an important corrective provided by Harold L. Kahn, Monarchy in the Emperor's Eyes (Cambridge, Mass., 1971), which deals with Emperor Ch'ien-lung's perception of himself. 96</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions the examinations for an official post.18 The accomplished scholars, having been depoliticized, were turned into academic or encyclopedists. Except for the famous "rebel thinkers" in the early Ching period, Confucianism had become docile. The Messianic dream, however, did not die. The cult of Imitatio Confuci was carried on at the end of the last century by Kang Yu-wei ak. Kang considered himself another "Confucius," reborn after 2,000 (500 x 4) years fittingly.19 I have looked into the life of Kang and found his sense of sagehood authentic. In fact, the reason why this master never could adopt the republic ideology that his student Liang Ch'i-ch'ao eventually adopted was not simply his conservativism or his loyalty to the crown-but the simple fact that, for Kang, republics do not believe in sages and have no place for sages like him. Lo mentions also Sun Yat-san as another person that continued the Confucian dream, but I can see little sage consciousness in this western-trained liberal.20 Lo's research therefore leads up to the present and leaves us with a problem concerning the destiny of the Confucian tradition. In closing, I would add my own reflections on this issue. What is Confucianism, its modern fate and its future destiny? To answer that, one must know who Confucius was, but, as shown already, Confucius meant different things to different people at various times. Creel's Confucius or the Confucius in the New Life Movement in Taiwan is not the last of Confucius. I would rather follow Karl Jaspers and speak of the Master as the "Paradigmatic Personality."21 Confucius was a scholar, a lover of learning, a man of humanity. In his life, he sought a political career to put his ideal into practice. Failing, he turned to teaching, becoming an editor, a retired scholar, perhaps a historian, and, at times, a nature lover. He was an admirer of classical culture and moderation, a filial son, a critic of society, a ritual formalist even. He was a man of vision and hope, who felt a sense of calling, and yet, frustrated, was resigned to his allotted destiny. He was all these and more: perhaps a Sage, a King. There is one thing he never was although that had always been associated with him. He was never a bureaucrat that stacked the Chinese imperium. (Sometimes, reading Chinese institutional history and observing how Confucians have behaved-out of class interests, etc.-one wonders whether, if 18 The ladder of success being open then to a greater body of aspirants and the fact that actual openings were very limited created, in part, a concern more for "career identity" than authentic "sage identity" as insisted upon by the founding figures in Sung. 19 Kang, relying himself on the Old Script texts, revived the image of Confucius as a political reformer. Then he himself, Kang, would be the Sage-advisor to the crown in a constitutional monarchy experiment. 20 But then, the traditional Sage image might have to be abandoned as sage- hood become democratized (see n. 13 above). 21 Karl Jaspers, The Great Philosophers (New York, 1962). 97</page><page sequence="10">Book Reviews Marx was no Marxian and Freud no Freudian, then the Master was never a "Confucian.")22 Still, what is Confucianism? The "-ism" assumed that there is one definable entity, but there have been Confucians who ranged from "tough" ones to "soft" ones.23 What unites them as Confucians is probably the master as the "Paradigmatic Model." Confucians had been scholars, lovers of learning, political aspirants, frustrated idealists cynics, nature lovers, retirees, visionaries, etc., all the plights of moral intellectuals (admittedly not too good with their hands) faced with the reality of politics and economics. In the West, Christian martyrs had died on the cross because Christ, as their model, died on the cross. If Confucianism had not generally been known for such religious zeal, it was because the Master who never was crucified had institutionalized a different definition and resolution of the human dilemma, a different cultural and personal identity.24 There is an earthliness in Confucian piety, a stubborn belief in an ethical universe (Western religions have abandoned that concept since the fall of Rome, in preference for delayed justice in heaven, hells, and future kingdoms), a deep awareness of the eclipse of Heaven (to borrow a term from Buber's The Eclipse of God),25 and a "convictionless conviction" that chaos, like peace, will not last forever.26 I will cite something from the historian Ch'ien Mual to show one aspect of the still living Confucian spirit. Ch'ien Mu is perhaps the foremost historian alive and he is no myth builder. Yet in his preface to his work, Kuo-shih ta-kangam, he notes in passing-in that stubborn Confucian conviction-"Heaven will not desert China," 22 God, a German theologian said once, is not the Answer but the Question. Perhaps the Master should remain, even for Communists, a gadfly that cannot be ignored. 23 The terms "tough" and "soft," referring to the mentality of the Confucians, were used here to underline the fact that there is a whole spectrum of Confucians ranging from one end, the pro-legalistic and active extreme, to the other, the pro- Taoist and mystical. There may be main-line Confucians, traditionalists emphasiz- ing ritual propriety and so on, but there are really no "card-carrying" Confucians (see Benjamin Schwartz, "Some Polarities in Confucian Thought," in Con- fucianism in Action, ed. Nivison and Wright [Stanford, Calif., 1959]). 24 In the vocabularies of Weber and Erikson, the phenomenon is that of a "charismatic" personality whose triumph over his "identity crisis" became the model, paradigm, or an institutionalized pattern for the culture that looked up to him. 25 The death of God would be too strong a term in this context. Confucians can understand Lao-tzu's statement which said "Heaven and Earth are not humane, jenaz," and Confucians knew Chinese history too well not to see the injustices and follies of men. However, China was not known for producing indignant Jobs. Raving against Heaven, calling God to court, gets nothing done. Man must fulfil his lot, his ming (see n. 6 above). See Chan's comments in Wing-tsit Chan, ed., A Sourcebook in Chinese Philosophy (Princeton, N.J., 1963), pp. 22-23, 78-79. 26 Traditional Chinese view of history is that there are periods of rule followed by periods of chaos. Chinese historiography has been too objective to deserve the oft-made comments that, compared with the Judeo-Christian sense of history, Chinese history is "cyclical." Rather, the Confucians live without any illusion about history-cyclical or lineal. I hope in my footnotes I have not depicted an existential Confucianism, because Confucians make bad existentialists-they never had the angst that came out of a post-Christian disillusion with essences. 98</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions now temporarily ruled over by an Unconfucian party.
