<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES FROM THE BIBLICAL HYMN TO THE MYSTICAL HYMN Benjamin Uffenheimer This paper discusses the religious awareness expressed in biblical hym nology in contrast with the mystical type found in hekhalot literature. It also delineates the transitional stage between the two, as represented in the Qumran Angelic liturgy Shirot cOlat ha-Shabbat. Their common elements are their expressions of praise and glorifica tion of the Almighty, and their frequently uttered call to the individual to join in the doxology. Subsequently their ways diverge: 1. The principal element of the biblical hymn is the address to God without an intermediary whether during the performance of the ritual or by individual intuition unconnected with any rites. The content of the hymn evolves from the worshipper's contemplation of the divine works, in nature or in history, and especially in the acts of salvation performed by God for Israel's benefit in the past. This genre assumes that man is involved in an ongoing dialogue with God, a dialogue which is not restricted to miracles or to hearkening to the divine voice. Its main pillar is man's confidence that God listens to and accepts his words of praise. In contrast, the mystic hymn focuses exclusively on a 'different real ity', i.e. the divine world. It is postulated on the feeling that the conti nuity of the direct dialogue has been broken and that God is no longer accessible to the ordinary man. The worshipper therefore turns to the heavenly host to act as his intermediary. He beseeches them to bring his utterances of glorification to the heavenly throne. It would then seem that there are two choices open to the man who wishes to return to the process of dialogue: that of community worship, in which the members of the congregation wish to join in the songs of the angels by directing their prayers in conjunction with the angelic prayer; and the individu alistic way of the mystics 'yorde ha-merkava', achieved by self-affliction, ecstatic effort, charms, and the practice of magical theurgy. 2. In the biblical hymn the approach to God is depicted in anthropo morphisms, extending to the intimacy of touch by the hand of God, [VII]</page><page sequence="2">Summaries which defends and guides the worshipper (Ps. 73:23f¥.)• In contrast, the mystic experience is depicted as a pilgrimage, an ascent to the heavenly temple, expressed in terminology taken from the ritual. However, the dialogue is not renewed, since the sight of the King in all His glory is a visual experience that cannot be expressed in words. Even the angelic song in which the mystic takes part does not change the situation, since the King sits on His throne without moving or reacting, enveloped in the awe felt by the angelic host and their unrestrained outbursts of joy. 3. From the literary aspect, the biblical hymn with its great variety of types and diversification has a recognizable artistic structure which af fords an ample frame in which the praises to God can be formulated. In contrast, the literary spectrum of the mystic hymnology derives from the uninhibited ecstatic mood induced by the crescendo of praise, with out a rationale, which engendered the liturgical-mystic compositions that have had a lasting influence on the ritual of normative Judaism. From the structural aspect, the literary innovation introduced in these passages is achieved by syllabic metre, whereas biblical poetry, including the hymns, relies on the number of accentuated words in the line and on the principle of repetition. 4. In the Shirot cOlat ha-Shabbat we can already notice the rejection of the historical-social motifs and the appearance of the mystic trends, whether reflecting a practical theurgy or a spiritualized interpretation of the ancient biblical tradition. The mystic hymn in the hekhalot and Qumran literature is intended for a purely vocal rendering, whereas that of the biblical hymn is con structed for a mixed musical performance, combining singing, instru mentalists and dance. THE FOUR EMPIRES OF DANIEL, CHAPTER 2, IN THE LIGHT OF TEXTS FROM QUMRAN Devorah Dimant The Four Empires sequence, Babylon, Media, Persia, Greece, repre sented by a huge, multi-metal statue, is a well-known image which ap pears in the vision of Nabuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel, Chapter 2. The significance of the statue itself is clear enough; it represents the ephemeral human rule, to be replaced by the eternal, divine one. The [VIII]</page><page sequence="3">Summaries image itself could have been drawn from the contemporary cultic or memorial statues, widespread in the ancient world. Less clear are the origins and background of the four empires se quence itself. It has no antecedents in earlier biblical books. The empha sis laid on oriental empires indicates its oriental origin. Indeed, schemes of three or four periods of world rules are known from both oriental and Graeco-Roman sources. However, the combination of em pires and metals is unique to Daniel. It was already suggested in the past that the Danielic author may have drawn such a combination from a Persian adaptation of the four empires schemes. The Persian Bahman Yasct relates a vision revealed to Zarathustra, in which the reigns of the Persian kings are symbolized by a tree with branches of various metals. Although this Persian text is a relatively late version, it may go back to earlier Persian sources. In deed, the missing link connecting such Persian sources with Daniel may possibly be found in a new Qumran Aramaic text, the so-called Four Trees Apocalypse (4Q552-4Q553). The Qumran text is set against the background of a royal court, where a seer relates his dream to a king. In his dreamn he saw a vision of four trees representing four em pires, of which two, Babylon and Persia, have survived. The Qumran text, then, lends support to the thesis that the Daniel version of the Four Empires scheme was drawn from Persian traditions. GOD'S ׳HUMILITY׳ Yehoshua Amir Along with the highly elated concept of God's majesty, illustrated by thousands of similes portraying Him in the image of an all-powerful monarch who is a 'king of flesh and blood׳, the rabbis also dared to conceive the opposite notion, of His ׳humility׳. Similes representing this trend may be introduced by the formula: 'Come and see, the Holy One, blessed be He, is not like a king of flesh and blood׳. An earthly king has to confirm his inaccessibility by a rigid set of court ceremonies. God can be liberal in this respect for He is in no need of such restrictions. Such a view can be extracted from biblical pronouncements by a small, almost imperceptible, transformation. The prophet envisages God as dwelling in a high and holy place, yet He can see from there the [IX]</page><page sequence="4">Summaries man who is of a contrite and humble spirit and come to his aid. How ever, the rabbis depict Him as leaving his lofty seat and descending Himself to those in need of Him. Such a meaning is often squeezed out of a verse by artificial exegesis, but it is just this artificiality that proves how much the exegete is emotionally interested in his paradoxical re suit. His main proof text 'His humility has made me great׳ (Ps. 18:36) seems by itself to be a product of rabbinical tampering with the text by means of an unconvincing vocalization of the words. Yet it is just this postulated ׳humility׳ of God that evokes admiration in Midrashic liter ature. In this vein the Midrash likes to reshape biblical narrations and to attribute to God traits of modesty in behaviour, e.g. God visits Abra ham without His royal escort and asks the venerable man to remain seated, etc. Similarly, God is represented as fulfilling various social and religious functions, as a teacher, a cantor, a performer of marriages, and the like. We have to see the rabbinical re-interpretation of God's relationship in this context. God does not only maintain his alliance with the people of Israel but He is involved in their trials Himself. Wherever the people of Israel are exiled, God is exiled with them, and when liberating them He liberates Himself, as well. This may be the greatest source of confi dence for the exiled people in confirming their final redemption. THE CONCEPT OF THE PLEROMA IN HEKHALOT MYSTICAL LITERATURE Joseph Dan Hekhalot mystical literature is the earliest group of Hebrew texts which recognizes a multiplicity of powers in the divine realm. The treatises of this literature, written in Eretz Israel and Babylonia between the third and the seventh centuries, include several elements which can be under stood as denoting the presence of a second divine power besides God, probably a demiurge (the Shiur Qoma as the Creator, Metatron as a di vine entity in possession of the 'secrets of creation'). However, a close analysis of several hekhalot texts, mainly those of Hekhalot Rabbati and Sefer Hekhalot ("The Third Book of Enoch') seems to indicate that the authors entertain the concept of a ׳pleroma', the existence of multiple [X]</page><page sequence="5">Summaries divine forces, and not a duality alone. The second part of Sefer Hekhalot includes a detailed description of the divine realm, listing numerous such powers in a very systematic hierarchy and using a distinct termi nology in referring to each layer. The number eight is meaningful in the organization of these hierarchical groups. The main distinction between these powers and angelic ones is the title 'YHVH Lord God of Israel', which is added to their names. A sim ilar system can be found in Hekhalot Rabbati, which also describes two figures, Totrosiai and Zahariel, in unmistakably divine terminology. It is very doubtful whether this pleroma can be designated as gnostic. It lacks mythical, dynamic elements, and is completely subservient to the supreme Godhead. It does reflect, however, the intensity of the mys tical experiences of these early Jewish spiritualists and their radical de parture from the prevalent norms in the rabbinical culture. JUDAH HALEVTS SYNESTHETIC THEORY OF PROPHECY AND A NOTE ON THE ZOHAR Warren Zev Harvey What did the prophets see when they said that they saw God in the ׳appearance of a man׳ (Ezek. 1:26) or as a king on a throne (Isa. 6:1)? Halevi is often ambiguous about this, but there is one passage in which he presents a theory of prophetic vision: Kuzari, IV, 3, 236.6-240.13. The five senses, it is argued in this passage, do not apprehend the essences of physical objects, but only their accidents, yet from such sensibilia the intellect acquires knowledge of their essences. Similarly, in prophetic visions, the internal sense (al-hass al-bätin) or inner eye (al-cayn al-bätina) does not apprehend the essences of the incorporeal divine beings, but does attain sensibilia from which the intellect deduces knowledge of their essences. This prophetic internal sense is ׳close to the imagination', a sort of superimaginatio. It was from Algazali and the Sufis that Halevi borrowed the notion of an ׳inner eye׳ which directly perceives the divine. He may be origi nal, however, in identifying this inner eye with the imagination or superimagination. He remarkably conflates the Aristotelian ׳internal senses' (e.g. imagination, memory, sensus communis) with the mystical ׳inner eye'. The prophets, Halevi says, perceive the incorporeal divine beings as [XI]</page><page sequence="6">Summaries physical objects, and describe them accordingly. This seems to presup pose a synesthetic relation between the inner eye and the external senses. Just as the (physiological or psychological) phenomenon of syn esthesia exists among the external senses, such that a stimulus directed to one may be received by another (e.g. seeing sounds, tasting sights), so it exists between the inner eye and the external senses, such that incorporeal stimuli may be received as corporeal images. The prophet's corporeal descriptions of the incorporeal thus have cognitive content in the same way as has the statement, 'The singer has a sweet voice'. Halevi's theory of prophecy differs from those of the Aristotelians, Saadia, and the Neo-Platonists in that it presents the imagination or superimagination as having direct perception of the divine. It is coher ent with his concept of dhawk or tacam (׳taste׳; cf. Ps. 34:9), also bor rowed from Algazali (Kuzari, IV, 16). The role of the imagination or superimagination in prophecy reflects the affinity of prophecy and poetry in Halevi. In his poems, he often wrote of prophetic-like experiences. A Note on the Zohar. There is some evidence that Halevi's synesthetic theory of prophecy influenced a passage in the Zohar (Gen. Va-Yera, 103a-b), which interprets Proverbs 31:23. God cannot be known, save through the imaginings (shacarim). R. JOSEPH GDfCATILLA'S DEFINITION OF SYMBOLISM AND ITS VERSIONS IN KABBALISTIC LITERATURE Boaz Huss At the end of the introduction to his book, Shcfare Ora, R. Joseph Gikatilla discusses the use of anthropomorphic symbols. Gikatilla's statements constitute one of the most important discussions in Kabbalist literature on the significance of its symbolism. His remarks influenced many Kabbalists, who frequently quoted or paraphrased them. Examples may be found in the writings of R. Menachem Recanati, in Sefer Ha-Shem, attributed to R. Moses de Leon, and in the works of R. Johanan Alemanno, R. Elia of Ginzano, R. Meier ibn Gab bai, R. Simeon ibn Labi, R. Moses Cordovero, R. Isaiah Horowitz, et al. The present article surveys the main points in Gikatilla's conception of Kabbalistic symbolism, and various approaches to symbolism ex [XII]</page><page sequence="7">Summaries pressed by Kabbalist writers influenced by him. The author undertakes an analysis of Gikatilla's definitions, examines the writings of the Kabbalists concerned, and consults the scholarly literature on the sub ject. The study reveals various emphases and trends in these interpre tations, and demonstrates the variety of approaches to Kabbalistic sym bolism in the literature. Gikatilla's definition was formulated to serve as an alternative model to the philosophical view that interprets anthropomorphic expressions in the Bible as metaphors. In contrast to this, Gikatilla puts forward the theory of 'reversed metaphor׳: it is not God Who is described in human terms, but the contrary - the human figure is designated according to the name of the divine being. Gikatilla emphasizes the theurgical aspect of the symbol. In his definition, the symbolic link between the human body and the divine being does not serve as a means of knowing God, but of influencing Him. Gikatilla's definition of symbolism is not con cerned with its epistemological role. The connection between man's form and the divine world enables man to exert an effect on the heav enly world, but not to know it or express it. Examination of the transformations that Gikatilla's definition has undergone reveals differing trends in interpreting symbolism in Kabbalistic litterature. These trends are expressed in the differences that various Kabbalists introduced into Gikatilla's statements. Gikatilla sees a symbolic link between corporeal body and the divine beings par allel to it. An examination of the later paraphrases of this definition shows that some Kabbalists had reservations rgarding the view that the symbol is the corporeal body, or that it symbolizes a divine being. While some Kabbalists emphasized the theurgical and mystical aspect of the symbol, and expanded Gikatilla's statements in this direction, others adopted an epistemological approach. These utilized Gikatilla's words to express the view that regarded symbols as allegories and images en abling man to perceive and discuss the divine realm. SEFER CEZRAT HA-SHEM Michal Oron This article introduces a fourteenth-century manuscript of a short anonymous treatise discussing the merits of the Kabbalah and the ten spheres. It includes a biographical introduction in which the author [XIII]</page><page sequence="8">Summaries tells about his roamings in Spain and his meetings with Spanish philos ophers, who mock the Kabbalah's teachings and totally repudiate them. He is therefore determined to give battle to counter the philosophers' ideas and prove the veracity and superiority of Kabbalah doctrine. The author presents his argument in the form of a dialogue between a man and a woman, each representing opposite points of view. The woman presents the philosophers' point of view while the man pre sents that of the Kabbalah. This is the first treatise in the literature of Jewish thought in which a role is given to a woman. ON THE SECRET OF CAUSE AND EFFECT IN THE WRITINGS OF R. SHABBETAISHEFTEL HOROVITZ OF PRAGUE Bracha Sack R. Shabbetai Sheftel Horovitz (Prague, 1565-1619) saw the Jewish soul as 'a divine part from above'. He stressed in his writings that the special connection between the Jew and his God is like that between the Sefirot and the Ein Sof- the connection of the effects to their causes. The proc ess of descent by stages of the effects and causes is a process of with drawal (zimzum) and weakening. The Jewish soul that descends from above is clad in the garments of the different worlds. Above, when it is in the world of the Sefirot, the soul of the individual (i.e. its supernal root) is united with the rest of the many Jewish souls in a simple unity, the unity of the parts. While it manifests the interaction and cohesion of these roots with one another, yet it does not completely eliminate the differences among the righteous of Israel, each of whom is privileged to be 'a part of the divine from above'. The degrees of the righteous are established in accordance with their spiritual achievements and they are organized in a succession of causes and effects. THE CONFRONTATION WITH THE DUTY OF KAWWANA Moshe Halamish The author discusses the attitude of Kabbalists to the significance of mystical 'intention׳ (kawwana) and attempts to clarify the position of the Kabbalists who did not adopt it. Since the interpretation of kawwana, its [XIV]</page><page sequence="9">Summaries contents and aims, changed in the course of time with the different streams of Kabbalistic thought, the position of those who did not exer eise kawwana was repeatedly questioned. The growing number of kawwanot regarded as obligatory made the question increasingly acute. Various positions and solutions were developed, some of which even doubted the validity of obligatory kawwana, or at least established an other scale of values in which it is not given first place. The author has restricted himself here to a survey of some basic lines of thinking in the trends, permutations, problems and solutions that surfaced in the confrontation with kawwana. TIME AND SPACE - A THEOLOGICAL-PHILOSOPHICAL CONTROVERSY BETWEEN MIGUEL CARDOSO AND NATHAN OF GAZA Nissim Yosha It is known that Abraham Miguel Cardoso and Nathan of Gaza, impor tant thinkers of the Sabbatean movement, disagreed over theological questions such as the apotheosis of their Messiah. It appears that Cardoso also disagreed with Nathan on the theological-philosophical question of time and space, which has a significant bearing on the un derstanding of the process of creation. Nathan, who relied on a verbal pronouncement of Sabbatai Sevi, pos tulated that the creation took place in time. Hence the never-ending question arises why it took place at a certain moment in time and not before or after it. Cardoso, however, considered that even to ask that question was in some way a denial of God, since before time and space while time and space were (עילת העילות) there existed the cause of causes created together with the creation. Cardoso tells in one of his autobio graphical epistles that in 1673 he sent his tractate Boqer de-Avraham with a lengthy letter of Shabbatai Sevi, in which he complained about Na than's interpretation of this question, which according to Cardoso com prised three atheistic statements. The present article attempts to reconstruct Cardoso's letter with the help of his speculative writings which have not yet been published: Boqer de-Avraham, Derush ha-clqqarim, Derush 62 Peraqim, and Derush [XV]</page><page sequence="10">Summaries Hokhmato shel Avraham Avinu. The investigation thus brings to light a hitherto unknown speculative debate in the history of Sabbateanism. IS THERE A PHENOMENOLOGY OF RELIGION? R.J. Zwi Werblowsky The study of religion(s) has split into several sub-disciplines, spawned by differences in both the foci of study and the methods employed. Next to history, sociology, psychology, etc., of religion, phenomenology has established itself as a major (and according to its practitioners priv ileged) field. No doubt that there has been a phenomenology of religion avant la lettre, but the term has also been used in a variety of meanings unconnected with the study of religion. Mainly through the work of Gerardus van der Leeuw, phenomen ology of religion has become the accepted term for a very specific way of looking at religious 'phenomena׳. Its dependence on certain theories of Verstehen as the special method of the Humanities (the Dilthey tradi tion), as well as on Husserl's brand of philosophical phenomenology, is evident. The title of van der Leeuw's magnum opus Religion in Essence and Manifestation is hardly thinkable without Husserl's Wesensschau. This article argues that the application of Husserlian concepts and terminology to the study of religion remains confined to trivialities or, alternatively, divests the study of religion, which is the empirical study of a certain group of historical phenomena, of all scientific character and value. No doubt the desire to achieve a 'deeper' and more ׳inside' understanding of the phenomena in question, and the refusal to remain satisfied with mere description 'from the outside' (whatever these ex pressions may mean) is laudable. But the use of the term phenomen ology only breeds confusion where confusion already abounds, and the methods employed are flawed and inadequate. [XVI]</page><page sequence="11">Summaries A PROFILE OF R. NAPHTALIKATZ OF FRANKFORT AND HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS SHABBATEANISM Yehuda Liebes R. Naphtali Katz (1645-1719), one of the most interesting Jewish figures of the eighteenth century, is known also as an opponent of and polemist against Shabbateanism. However, we show here that R. Naphtali's at titude towards this movement was not unequivocal: he gave approba tions to Shabbatean books, befriended Shabbatean sages, and discussed with them such subjects as the writings of Ishmael, Shabbetai Zevi's son. However, most revealing in this respect are R. Naphtali's own writ ings, and foremost his expository (derash) books. These reveal views typical of Shabbateans, including their paradoxical theosophic symbol ism, their attitude towards the question of good and evil and other re ligions, and their special views regarding the age of redemption. Noteworthy also is R. Naphtali's tendency to fabricate, or rephrase, old Midrashic sayings, or even scriptural verses, and enhance their fan tastic or paradoxical nature. Moreover, R. Naphtali's whole personality is in accordance with the Shabbatean sages: he was prone to magical practices, lived in a world of fantasy, and his aspiration to perfection was of the kind that is almost unachievable in this world. Many exam pies of all these traits are introduced in the present article. AN ANONYMOUS COMMENTARY ON IDRA RABA BY A MEMBER OF THE SARUQ SCHOOL Ronit Meroz The text published here is an annotated critical edition of an anony mous commentary on the section of the Zohar entitled Idra Raba. An analysis of the commentary, the provenance of which is undoubtedly the school of Israel Saruq, and comparison with other texts, allows us to conclude that this commentary belongs to the 'eastern branch' of that school. The foreword sets out some of the pivotal ideas held by the anony mous author: 1. The zimzum in Ein So/is not a real 'contraction', but rather a pre [XVII]</page><page sequence="12">Summaries paratory step for the creation of the world: God's will (or thought) to create the world immediately materializes itself as space. God's thought is therefore space as well. He resides in it as well as outside it. The author thus uses the expressions 'the surrounded infinity' and 'the surrounding infinity' to describe the relationship between God and the world. We could also say that the created world is God as thought and space although God has other aspects as well. These ideas greatly resemble those of Spinoza. The astonishing fact is that they were summarized in a book found in Spinoza's own library. All this sets our author, a disciple of Luria, as the first in a long line of Kabbalists and Hasidim who did not understand the term zimzum literally. 2. The malbush ('divine garment׳, the first entity different from Infin ity) is woven out of letters; and these, in turn, out of dot-like light. From the malbush emerges the huut Ein So/('thread of Infinity') which imparts light to the lower entities and is itself filled with dots of light. Since the dots are circular, what they create, namely, primeval man, Adam Kadmon, is circular as well. 3. Like other texts of the Saruq school, the commentary reveals the author's aspiration to achieve the mystical experience of the malbush through magical means. LURIANIC KABBALAH, SHABBATEANISM AND HASIDISM: HISTORICAL SEQUENCE, SPIRITUAL AFFINITY, AND DIFFERENCES OF IDENTITY Rachel Elior Scholem's comment in the concluding chapter of Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, stating that ׳Lurianic Kabbalah, Sabbatianism, and Hasi dism are after all three stages of the same process' (Major Trends, p. 327), raised a great scholarly response and debate. However, his sequential further comment, 'No less surprising, however, is the fact that this burst of mystical energy was unproductive of new religious ideas, to say nothing of new theories of mystical knowledge ... Hasidism seems to have produced no truly original Kabbalistic thought whatever' (Major Trends, pp. 338,340), generated very little response. In the first section the present article tries to reassess the relationship between Shabbateanism and Hasidism, on both revealed historical and [XVIII]</page><page sequence="13">Summaries hidden spiritual premises, and in the second section to discuss the role of Lurianic Kabbalah in Hasidic thought, and in the third section to define the uniqueness of Hasidism along with the originality of its di alectical teachings. Hasidism adopted the concepts of the Kabbalistic theogony, in which processes are constantly repeated in the upper worlds, and it trans formed them into the cornerstone for understanding the true signifi cance of reality in all its levels. It did so by applying the principles of the divine dialectic to the inner essence of all the worlds, while relating to all the components of existence as infinite metamorphic processes on the one hand, and as units which can be taken apart and reassembled on the other. Hasidic doctrine created a multi-level conceptual system which si multaneously referred to both the divine being and human conscious ness, while interpreting the divine processes of creation and the human processes of thought according to a single metamorphical structure of concepts. Both the day-to-day ethos of the congregation and the mysti cal leadership of the Zaddiq took shape around the same structure of concepts which viewed spiritual change as valid only when it was ac companied by social significance. Any perusal of Hasidic homiletical literature will reveal that the basic concepts of Hasidism always possess double and redoubled meanings. These concepts refer both to divine being and its transformation and to human thought and its mundane manifestations. Likewise, they pertain to the leadership of the Zaddiq, with its spiritual and corporeal meaning, and to the Kabbalistic sym bolism which represents the relation existing between the various as pects of divinity. R. ABRAHAM OF KALISK AND R. SHNEUR ZALMAN OF LADI - A FRIENDSHIP CUT OFF Ray a Haran The purpose of this article is to examine the nature of the relationship between R. Abraham of Kalisk and R. Shneur Zalman of Ladi during their stay at the court of R. Dov Baer of Mezrich (the Maggid). It also describes the changes that took place in the relations between them, and the status of each of them during the twenty years that elapsed from the time of R. Abraham's emigration to Palestine (1777) in the [XIX]</page><page sequence="14">Summaries company of R. Menahem Mendel of Vitebsk until the publication of the Tanya (1797). In addition, the article considers the rebuke by R. Abraham to R. Shneur Zalman following the latter ׳s publication of the Tanya, and the controversy that broke out between them. The ideological back ground of the controversy is not discussed here. R. Abraham and R. Shneur Zalman had both been disciples of the Maggid. Moreover, after the Maggid's death, when he was replaced by R. Menahem Mendel as head of the Hasidic community in White Rus sia, both R. Abraham and R. Shneur Zalman recognized R. Menachem Mendel's authority and leadership. Thus, the two Zaddiqim, R. Abra ham and R. Shneur Zalman, belonged to the same stream of Hasidic thought. After R. Menahem Mendel's death in Tiberias (1788), the leadership of his community in the Holy Land and the diaspora was divided be tween R. Abraham and R. Shneur Zalman. When the Tanya was pub lished, R. Abraham wrote to R. Shneur Zalman condemning him for the publication of the book and for his method of Hasidism. The epistle started a sharp controversy between the two, which became increas ingly intense and did not recede even after the death of those who started it. Echoes of R. Shneur Zalman's teachings reached R. Abraham even before the appearance of the Tanya. However, after the publication of that book, R. Abraham could not restrain himself or hide his dissatis faction at R. Shneur Zalman's ways. Thus he wrote the above mentioned epistle, which is indicative both of the authority that R. Abraham felt towards R. Shneur Zalman and of the freedom he felt to rebuke another Zaddiq. Nine years after R. Abraham's letter of rebuke to R. Shneur Zalman, and about thirty years after R. Abraham had left Russia, the latter re ceived a letter from R. Shneur Zalman concerning their dispute. In that letter R. Shneur Zalman Reminds R. Abraham of certain transgressions which R. Abraham supposedly had commited in his early days. How ever, since this accusation lacks any additional evidence, it is highly doubtful whether the passage in question is authentic. [XX]</page><page sequence="15">Summaries FROM YOUTH TO LEADERSHIP AND FROM KABBALAH TO HASIDISM - STAGES IN THE SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE AUTHOR OF SEFAT EMET Yoram Jacobson The canonical work of the Hasidic school of Gur, Sefat Emet is the out come of R. Judah Loeb's thirty-five years of spiritual leadership and homiletical activity. The work is homogeneous in character, and one cannot distinguish early from late phases in its development. However, we have in our possession a work from R. Judah Loeb's early years (most of which was written between 1866 and 1870) before he was ap pointed the second Admor of Gur. This work, printed under the title Liqqutim, is of great importance for the understanding of the spiritual development of a Hasidic leader. The book was printed by the author's son, the third Admor of Gur. He points out that the book was only one of his late father's numerous youth writings, which he had ordered to be destroyed. The question arises: Why did he do so? To reach the answer, we have to examine the character of the Liqqutim. The book consists of many exegetical notes and some more systematic writings. The range of issues dealt with in the Liqqutim is wide: biblical verses, Midrashic texts and notions, halakhic issues, eth ical problems and, above all, Kabbalistic and Hasidic matters. As opposed to the great homiletical work of Sefat Emet, which rarely refers to identified sources, the book of Liqqutim reflects the deep curi osity and distinguished erudition of the young author in relation to all the divergent sources of Judaism. Above all, one can trace in the Liqqutim both the Kabbalistic and Hasidic influences originating from the vast literature of the two movements. The author often refers to his sources - even those regarded as highly authoritative - with sharp crit icism. Judah Loeb is reflected in his Liqqutim as a young and restless scholar, still free from the burden of imparting Torah and leading a community. The book expresses the first and fresh encounter of a young scholar with the sources of his study; he wonders, criticizes, accepts, compares, looks for the validity of a text, suggests an interpretation of his own, or rejects that of others. As soon as he is appointed Admor, however, he feels obliged to go another way. In a moment, so to speak, he loses the spirit of a young scholar and, becoming aware of the heavy responsibility of leading the large Hasidic community, he changes his style and bends to the new task. In Sefat Emet, the author does not in [XXI]</page><page sequence="16">Summaries troduce himself in personal terms, and the homilies represent a crystal lized, solid, spiritual world, in which there is no room for doubt or problems to be discussed and solved. In Sefat Emet, R. Judah Loeb is compelled by his assumption of the leadership to introduce to his audience, time and again, the spiritual commandments of the Hasidic world. The Admor is the live and per sonal embodiment of those fulfilled commandments and cannot, there fore, appear in front of his audience as a doubting leader, still in search of a new, true understanding. The spiritual world he represents must be one with the entire Jewish heritage. Of special interest in this respect is Judah Loeb's attitude to the Kab bala. In the Liqqutim many Kabbalistic theosophical subjects are dis cussed, whereas in Sefat Emet, the Kabbalistic terminology is used to understand and explain the changing nature of the human condition. This change was not the result of a gradual development; it happened at once, reflecting the new responsibility of the Hasidic leader. Here lies the answer to the question asked above: R. Judah Loeb or dered that his early writings should be destroyed because he consid ered them 'youthful follies'. As an Admor, he became the speaker of a living Torah, which leaves no room whatsoever for personal opinions or attitudes. The only task which remained was to express the Hasidic teachings of Sefat Emet, which are to last forever. HIDDEN POLEMICAL LETTERS ON THE NATURE OF HASIDISM Shmuel Werses The twenty letters published here were found among the hidden man uscripts in the library of the maskil writer Joseph Perl of Tarnopol, Ga licia, and are now in the National Library in Jerusalem. They are written in the hand of an unknown author, of maskil views, and directed against the Hasidic movement. The text, entitled here 'Polemical Letters', has been edited and clarified. It probably dates from c. 1814, thus preceding Joseph Perl's Megalle Temirin. The two works, both sharply anti-Hasidic in direction, are written in the form of a discursive epistolary exchange. However, in contrast to Perl's book, which achieved wide publicity in his time, there are no unfounded allegations in these writings. Most of them centre on a dis cussion between the representatives of various Hasidic groups and the [XXII]</page><page sequence="17">Summaries orthodox writer, who overcomes his opponents by his faithful adher ence to the Law of Moses, which he considers that Hasidism has in fringed. The main point of these letters is the discussion on the theoret ical basis of Hasidism and the ways of putting it into practice in the contemporary Jewish conditions, especially in the forms of prayer, the attitude to Talmudic studies and its students, and the relationship of Hasidism to Kabbalah. A few of the letters mention the activities of the Hasidic Zaddiqim who boast of their ability to perform miracles, although these are merely illusory The letters continue to echo the arguments that had been levelled against Hasidism at the end of the eighteenth century by the orthodox opposition. Some of these arguments now reiterated by the maskil author of the letters as set formulae, in continuation of the traditional mittnagdic arguments. The ׳Polemical Letters' are one of the first instances in anti-Hasidic maskil literature to employ the satirical epistolary genre. THE SACRED AND THE PROFANE IN R. KOOK'S PHILOSOPHY Yosef Ben-Shelomo There are two opposing concepts of the sacred. According to one it has an entirely different and separate being - the 'wholly other׳, existing apart from the reality of the natural world. It is the mysterium tremendum, which is revealed to man through numinous experience. The opposite view, that taken by R. Kook, regards the sacred as an on tological entity, immanent in the world and uniting it as a single organ ism. It is expressed in man's soul in his strivings to overcome the gulf between him and this entity, and to be united with it. However the sacred is not just an ontological entity but also a system of values, whereas the profane/secular is per se neutral in respect of values and can only act as the medium of change for good or bad. This is the position in respect of the secular spiritual realms: science, philos ophy, aesthetic creation and humanist morality. These do not represent values in themselves but they can serve as a basis for the sacred, and provide it with 'substance', which strengthens it in the world. It is in this way that one must understand R. Kook's radical state ments about 'the good that comes to the world by way of the profane', and the arousing of 'the power of the holy in the profane', and expres [XXIII]</page><page sequence="18">Summaries sions such as 'sacred flesh׳, and 'the vigor of the sanctified flesh'. Their meaning is not to nullify the valuational difference between the sacred and the profane, but rather to say that the strengthening of the profane world, both the material and the spiritual one, expands the platform for sacred actions within it. However, there is an underlying problem in the general metaphysi cal system of R. Kook. It denies any division or duality in the overall unity of being, and perhaps has led R. Kook beyond the bounds of his exoteric concept of the sacred and profane. The problem is clearly visi ble in the area of secular morality. 'Natural morality', in both pragmatic and social terms, certainly lacks any value and aim per se, as also the Kantian 'absolute morality' is secular and humanist, since it originates in the human reason and not from the divine source. But R. Kook claims that the demand for an absolute morality entails indirect knowledge of God, because one's very recognition of an abso lute moral value necessarily attaches it to a transcendent dimension, at least in terms of its being beyond relative human existence. Only by virtue of such a transcendent source can one derive the absolute valid ity of a moral imperative, and is one able to understand the existence of an inherent basis in the human soul which is capable of acceding to it: 'Morality in its divine voice enters the soul from the Life of all the worlds'. If this is so, then the humanist 'absolute morality' becomes part of the ׳cosmic morality' as R. Kook envisages it - the good in all types of effort by created beings to attain perfection, towards improvement and bet terment. Human morality is precisely the appearance of this aspiration in mankind. If this is correct in respect of other realms of the secular spirit as well, perhaps a different position emerges here from that we postulated at first, and the profane is not just a medium, or instrument, or preparation, for strengthening the sacred but conceals in itself a sub stantive holiness. Such a view is prone to the dangers of pantheism, and R. Kook may be alluding to this when he says that 'the sacredness in the profane that has practically descended into complete secularity is more intangible and sacred than the sacredness which is in the holy but it is deeply concealed'. In any case, this must be held as the esoteric doctrine of R. Kook. In his systematic and openly expressed credo the division between sacred and profane remains, and any unity between them is purely ontological. Indeed, the higher the degree of reality of any entity, i.e. the greater [XXIV]</page><page sequence="19">Summaries its degree of vitality and its spiritual creative power, the more one is able to discover by means of it the action of the divine holiness in the world. The creations of the geniuses of the spirit, and the geniuses of action - the 'divine' beauty, for example, of the music of Mozart, the pure moral will of the righteous of the world, and the striving for the non-pragmatic truth of genuine scientists and philosophers - all these are degrees of a highly sophisticated reality in the development of the universe and the human spirit, but they have no sanctity of themselves (and a truly secular person will, indeed, not attribute any holiness to them). R. KOOK, SPINOZA AND GOETHE: MODERN AND TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS IN THE THOUGHT OF R. KOOK Benjamin Ish-Shalom The specific trend characterizing the thought of R. Kook is the subject of considerable argument among students and scholars investigating his works. Was R. Kook a Kabbalist or mystic? A philosopher or poet? Was he just a continuator or interpreter of Kabbalist thought, or should we see him as a modern thinker? The article discusses the questions that have been raised with reference to new manuscript sources by the editor of Orot ha-Qodesh, R. David Cohen. It also brings additional ma terial that may throw light on the thinking of R. Kook from journals of his time. The comparisons suggested in the article between the writings of R. Kook and the sources discussed here, with particular reference to Spinoza and Goethe, demonstrate the modernity of R. Kook's approach by focusing on the clearly contemporary dilemmas and moral issues discernible in his works. All this is postulated on the fact that funda mentally R. Kook's works reflect a mystic experience and world view drawing its inspiration from the Kabbalist tradition.

This location represents a basic element of Rosenzweig's existential 'new thinking׳, namely the systematic role of cognition in general and ׳messianic epistemology' in particular. Epistemology is considered here as a post-factum view Nevertheless, this discussion is fundamental to the struggle that Rosenzweig develops from the very beginning of the Star against the idealistic pre-assumption of unity of thinking and being, a struggle which provides the whole book with its methodological grounding. The second part presents - by its categories of the 'miracle׳ and of revelation - man as God's counterpart in a subjective-objective relation ship. Man's point of view remains subjective, but now he is described as ׳viewing׳, from this very subjective point, the objectivity and truth of God's revelation. He is encountered by truth but only as a call upon him, as the expression of God's love for him. Rosenzweig opens his direct discussion on the truth with the decla ration 'God is the truth׳. The whole last book of the Star is devoted to reflections on the meaning of this declaration. Truth is God's ever existing seal, but as such it is recognizable only from the perspective of redemption, where the world will be 'given' solely by man's loving deeds and where both of them will create 'the All of nature'. And God will be its Master while He is truth. Rosenzweig does not conclude his discussion with a theoretical def inition of truth but goes on to ask what the meaning of such truth might be to man. Man knows only his part of the Divine truth that was re vealed to him. Truth as man's part is his subjective part of the whole objective Divine truth, which will only become his in the eternal Re demption. This concept of truth forms a non-relativistic pluralism, where man holds his truth only as his 'part' and should accept the fact that truth is revealed otherwise to others. He should recognize both his part and the other's as true only while they are aspects of the Divine truth. Man is called upon to ׳exercise' and 'verify׳ his own truth, and at the same time to 'view' the other's truth and acknowledge it. With that concept [XXVI]</page><page sequence="21">Summaries Rosenzweig brings the epistemological course of the Star to its comple tion. Concurrently it should provide his Jewish-Christian theology with a systematic base. Yet, this epistemology justifies an 'ecumenical׳ religious pluralism rather than the limited theological dualism that Rosenzweig developed after 1913, where only Christianity and Juda ism are acknowledged. THE THEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE RESCUE OF THE BELZER REBBE Eliezer Schweid When facing the Holocaust, the Belz Hasidim undertook a great rescue operation which required all their endeavours at the time: the removal of the Admor and his brother from the threat of death and transporting them via Budapest to Eretz Israel. This manifestation of an independent historical initiative expressed a revolutionary change in the attitude of the religious sector to the ques tion of hastening the redemption of the Jewish people by independent action. Despite their stubborn resistance to Zionism, the way was found for the religious-Hasidic sector to exercise their intervention in history. It resulted, according to the Belz Hasidim, in the victory of Judaism over the Nazis, and perhaps also heralded its victory over Jewish secu larism in anticipating its downfall. The myth surrounding the Admor ׳s success, as a miracle of redemp tion and God's ׳revelation of His countenance' in the innermost re cesses of the 'hidden countenance', represented the theological re sponse of the Belz Hasidim to the Holocaust. This, in conjunction with the penetrating expository words of the Admor's brother at their part ing in Budapest, provided the theoretical argumentation for this theol ogy The present study affords a systematic analysis of this myth and the theoretical basis furnished for its legitimation.
