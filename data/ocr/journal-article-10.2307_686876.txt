ZENZEN Introduction I Popper's Analysis. 2 Griinbaum's Argument. 3 A Maxwell-Boltzmann Calculation. INTRODUCTION Philosophers and scientists have often tried to establish the anisotropy of time by connecting it with the law that entropy tends to increase. Thus, irreversibility and entropy production have been conceptually linked. However, as Karl Popper [1956-8] has pointed out there exist irreversible processes in nature which do not involve any increase in entropy. These non-entropic, boundary-dependent irreversible processes are called de facto irreversible in contradistinction to nomological, entropy-related irreversible processes. Adolf Griinbaum [1963, 1973, 1974] uses this notion of de facto ir- reversibility to establish a non-thermodynamic basis for the anisotropy of time. In doing so he borrows an example from Popper [1956], viz., a thin ideal gas which expands eternally from a centre into a spatially infinite universe. Both agree that the process is de facto irreversible but each uses different arguments to show that there is no entropy increase. Popper gives a qualitative intuitive argument and Griinbaum infers that, since the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is inapplicable to the process, the entropy cannot be defined. In his [1974] Griinbaum modifies this claim in light of a demonstration that a generalised course-grained entropy function can be defined for this process and can in fact be constructed to yield a quasi-monotonically increasing function. (Griinbaum attributes this idea to Robert B. Griffiths. It was, apparently, a private com- munication.) The modified claim is that in the case of a spatially infinite universe defacto irreversible processes may be entropic in Griffith's weaker sense but they are still "nonentropic" in the full-blown Maxwell-Boltz- mann sense.1 Received 20 April 1975 ' Grinbaum [19741], P. 780.</page><page sequence="2">314 Michael J. Zenzen In section z I shall examine Popper's argument and suggest that this kind of qualitative analysis based on an intuitive connection of entropy with 'disorder' is quite tenuous. In section 2 I argue that Griinbaum's analysis of the expanding gas is incorrect because (I) he fails to distinguish between available physical space, accessible points in phase space, currently occupied physical space and currently accessible points in phase space and (2) he mistakenly appeals to ergodic theory in arguing that the M-B statistics are inapplicable. The evaluation of his arguments leads naturally into a discussion of ergodic theory and the method of coarse-graining. In section 3 I apply the M-B statistics and formally demonstrate that the process does have a finite entropy. The conditions which must be satisfied for this entropy to remain constant in time are of interest. I POPPER'S ANALYSIS Popper [1956] makes the following distinction: As to dissipating processes, there are two kinds of dissipation which do not always seem to be clearly distinguished. Dissipation in the form of increasing disorder (entropy increase) is one of them, and dissipation by expansion without increase of disorder is the other. For an increase of disorder, walls of some kind are essential: a sufficiently thin gas expanding in a 'vessel without walls' (that is, the universe) does not increase its disorder. In the absence of walls, collisions become rapidly extremely improbable, and the degree of order of the system begins to increase in time, in the sense that the fastest particles will all be found near the periphery of the expanding gas ball and the slowest particles near its centre.1 What is wrong with Popper's analysis of the expanding gas ball? He seems to equate entropy with disorder and then argues that a sorting of particles according to their velocities will take place in such fashion that the system does not increase its disorder. However, he ignores the increase of disorder associated with the spatial expansion of the system and it is not intuitively clear that this disordering effect balances the ordering associated with the velocity sorting. As we shall see, the effects balance exactly if there are no collisions but this is something which requires a demonstration. In general, the intuitive connection of entropy with disorder is quite tenuous and can be at times very misleading, especially when one tries to analyse complex physical phenomena in such terms. As P. G. Wright [197o] notes, there are at least three distinct concepts of entropy: (i) the thermodynamic one associated with the work of Clausius: (2) the statistical 1 Popper [1956], p. 382.</page><page sequence="3">Popper, Griinbaum and de facto Irreversibility 315 mechanical concept of Boltzmann which relates macro-states and micro- states; and (3) the intuitive, phenomenological ideas of disorder. While (i) and (2) correspond precisely neither is more than roughly correlated with (3).1 Wright's article is replete with illustrative examples and counter- examples to show how attempts to apply the intuitive notion of 'disorder' lead to confusion. Relying on intuitive ideas of 'order' and 'disorder' in physical (or configuration) space, Popper infers that the process "does not increase its disorder" because of velocity sorting in configuration space. And it seems to him intuitively clear that, as the gas expands, it will sort itself out and become more 'ordered'. The relevant consideration here, however, is not 'order' or 'disorder' in configuration-space but rather 'order' or 'disorder' in position-velocity space. And our intuitions about this 'space' are vague indeed, unless we happen to have had much practice in 'mapping' from physical space to this complex space. 2 GRUNBAUM'S ARGUMENT Griinbaum [1963], as I have noted, agrees with Popper that the expansion process involves no entropy increase. However, his reasons for saying that the process is non-entropic are: (a) that the statistical Maxwell- Boltzmann entropy is not even defined for a spatially infinite universe, since the quasiergodic hypothesis, which provides the essential basis for the probability-metric ingredient in the Maxwell-Boltzmann entropy concept, is presumably false for an infinite phase space, (b) that the equili- brium state of maximum entropy cannot be realised, since a finite number of particles cannot be uniformly distributed in a phase-space of infinitely many cells.2 In his [1974] Griinbaum gives essentially the same argument: S.. the eternal expansion of a very thin gas from a center into a spatially infinite universe does not involve an entropy increase, and the de facto irreversibility of this process is therefore non-entropic. For by its definition as a measure of frequency of occurrence in time, the statistical Maxwell-Boltzmann entropy is assigned on the assumption that all coarse-grained microstates are equiprobable, and as a result, is not defined for a spatially infinite universe: the quasi-ergodic hypothesis, which provides the essential basis for the stated equiprobability ingredient in the M-B entropy concept, is presumably false for an infinite phase space .... It seems that the motivation for Griinbaum's argument is something like this: Entropy is a measure of frequency of occurrence in time but for 1 Wright [197o], p. 583. 2 Grtinbaum [1963], p 267. 8 Griinbaum [19741, p. 779. x</page><page sequence="4">316 Michael J. Zenzen the process of eternal expansion we are dealing with an infinite series. In formal terms, this might be re-phrased as: The ergodic hypothesis allows the move from space-averages to time-averages but since the process in question involves an infinite phase space, the hypothesis does not hold and the move can not be made. Entropy as a measure of frequency of occurrence in time can not be defined. It should be noted that the argument moves from the inapplicability of the M-B statistics to the nonentropic character of the process. Thus, when Griinbaum agrees with Popper that the process involves no increase of entropy, he means that no M-B entropy can be defined for the process whereas Popper seems to mean that there is no increase of entropy, in other words, that an entropy can be defined and it remains constant for the process. As we have seen, Popper's claim is based on qualitative con- siderations. However, in the next section I shall show that the M-B entropy concept is applicable to the process and in fact allows a formal demonstration that, under certain conditions, entropy does indeed remain constant. Let us turn now to the detailed consideration of Griinbaum's reasons for the inapplicability of the M-B entropy concept. There seem to be two considerations (i) the role of the quasiergodic hypothesis and (2) that no equilibrium state of maximum entropy can be realised. The relevance of (2) is not clear. Perhaps the point is that if there is no final state for the process then the total entropy production, presumably given by Sfnal-Sinittal, can not be calculated. It may be granted that a state of maximum entropy cannot be realised but this does not imply that the M-B entropy concept is inapplicable. One would have to establish that the M-B entropy can be defined and calculated only for processes which reach equilibrium. Suppose, however, there is a process which never reaches equilibrium but is such that dS/dt = o. Then S at any time will be equal to Sitial, the latter presumably involving no difficulties in definition. This sort of process is irreversible but non-entropic in a strict sense. With respect to (i): Griinbaum seems to be arguing that the quasi- ergodic hypothesis is a necessary condition for the definability and, hence, applicability of the M-B entropy concept. Since the hypothesis is false for an infinite phase-space, the M-B entropy concept is neither definable nor, a fortiori, applicable. But this argument depends on establishing (a) the necessity of the quasi-ergodic hypothesis for the probability metric of the M-B entropy concept, (b) the falsity of the hypothesis for an infinite phase-space and (c) the relevance of an infinite phase-space to the process in question.</page><page sequence="5">Popper, Griinbaum and de facto Irreversibility 317 Regarding (a): The status of the quasi-ergodic hypothesis is not clear and to say that it provides the essential basis for the probability metric of the M-B entropy concept is quite debatable. Ergodic theory does not 'provide' a probability metric but rather seeks to justify the choice of a particular measure. Tolman [1938] sketches the early development of ergodic theory and concludes that the hypothesis of equal a priori probabilities (or the choice of the natural measure) is the only one which is consistent with statistical methods and which can be adopted in a non-arbitrary manner. Such a choice leads to experimental agreement and these considerations are sufficient justification independent of any appeal to ergodic theory.' Sklar [1973] echoes Tolman's remarks and makes it quite clear that ergodic theory mistakenly seeks to understand why the choice of the natural measure gives 'good' results: Ergodic theory considers the question: Why does the natural probability distribution work? The answer it gives is the proven equality of phase-averages to infinite time averages. But there is a much simpler answer. And it is correct. And it is the full answer. And it is totally independent of any ergodic results. It goes like this: How a gas behaves over time depends upon (i) its microscopic constitution; (2) the laws governing the interaction of its micro-constituents; (3) the constraints placed upon it; and (4) the initial conditions characterizing the microstate of the gas at a given time.2 Ergodic theory is the general attempt to show how the natural prob- ability must follow from the structuring of the macrosystem out of its components and from the laws governing them. It is an attempt to prove that the world must be the way it happens to be. The limited 'success' and utility of ergodic theory in this endeavour is made clear by Sklar.3 Ergodic theory can show that if G (the 2mn--i dimensional hypersurface which represents the allowed region of phase space for a system of n particles each with mn degrees of freedom) is metri- cally indecomposable, then it can be shown that the choice of the natural measure will generate phase averages equal to infinite time averages for a function of a microstate. However, the relevance of such a result depends on showing that G appropriate to some plausible gas model is, in fact, indecomposable. I think these considerations are sufficient to cast doubt on the claim that the quasi-ergodic hypothesis, via ergodic theory, provides the essential basis for the probability metric of the M-B entropy concept. Turn now to (b) which says that the quasi-ergodic hypothesis is false 1 Tolman [1928], p. 65. 2 Sklar [1973], p. 210o. 3 Sklar [1973], p. 209.</page><page sequence="6">318 Michael J. Zenzen for an infinite phase space. Griinbaum's rendering of the quasi-ergodic hypothesis says that "each one of the mn microstates (n particles each with m degrees of freedom) are equiprobable or occur with the same frequency in time".' This formulation of the hypothesis seems to involve a misconception about the relations between the equiprobability of microstates and ergodic theory. The above discussion makes it quite clear that ergodic theory only says if G is metrically indecomposable and if microstates of the same extension in phase space are designated equiprobable, then phase-averages will equal infinite time-averages. Clearly, the quasi-ergodic hypothesis does not simply assert the equi- probability of microstates, nor does it simply equate equiprobability with equal frequency of occurrence in time. Correctly rendered the hypothesis would be something like: starting in any microstate a gas will pass as close as one likes to any other allowed microstate. It is only when the equiprobability assumption and metric indecomposability are added to this that the equal frequency of temporal occurrence follows. Thus, both Griinbaum's version and the more accurate formulation of the quasi-ergodic hypothesis are false. For if a system starts in an excep- tional highly non-random initial micro state, it will never get anywhere near most other microstates. And this holds irrespective of any considera- tions about infinite phase space. Griinbaum's claim that the quasi-ergodic hypothesis is false for an infinite phase space may be granted but only because the hypothesis as stated is false. The infinite character of phase space is not relevant. Regarding (c) Griinbaum seems to move from the spatial infinity of the universe, i.e. from the infinity of available physical or configuration space, to the infinity of phase-space. But for the expansion process which involves a ball of gas of finite energy, the phase space associated with the system at any time will always be finite even though there is an infinity of physical space available. Thus, while it may be granted that the statistical M-B entropy concept is not definable for an actually infinite system this is not to say that a M-B entropy cannot be defined for a system of finite energy which undergoes eternal expansion but at any time occupies only a finite region of space. What is relevant to a statistical mechanical calculation of entropy is the number of points in phase-space which are currently accessible to a system, not all those states which are accessible in all future times. One must carefully distinguish among available physical space, accessible 1 Grtinbaum [19631, P. 238.</page><page sequence="7">Popper, Griinbaum and de facto Irreversibility 319 points in phase space, currently occupied physical space, and currently accessible points in phase space. Before I give a mathematical demonstration that the entropy is constant for the expansion process I shall comment briefly on the suggestion of R. Griffiths which Grtinbaum cites in his [1974].1 Apparently in private communication Griffiths has pointed out that a generalised coarse-grained entropy function S = k In W is definable for a spatially infinite universe such that, by a suitable choice of the cell size of the coarse-grained 6- dimensional phase-space, all of the particles of the gas might start out in one cell even though their precise velocities are all different. For this initial state W will be given by n!/n! = i. If one waits long enough the particles will each be in a different cell so that W will be n! Griinbaum accepts this account and notes that the analysis does not depend on any assumption of probability metric for the coarse-grained microstates. He modifies his claim by saying that when he refers to Popper's de facto irreversible processes as non-entropic, this is to be taken in "the specified full-blown Maxwell-Boltzmann sense". These processes may be entropic in the weaker generalised sense of Griffiths. It is interesting to note that Griinbaum's primary reason for accepting Griffith's suggestion is that it does not depend on any assumptions about a probability metric for the coarse-grained microstates. If the 'graining' is 'coarse' enough then no problem arises with respect to the equiprob- ability of microstates since there is effectively only one microstate initially. But there is no problem with defining an M-B entropy for the system initially if one remembers that the relevant consideration is the equi- probability of the then accessible points in phase-space. As we have seen, there is no need to appeal to the quasi-ergodic hypothesis for this any more than it was needed in the case of coarse-graining; thus, if the virtue of coarse-graining is that it avoids problems which arise with respect to the equiprobability of microstates, then this virtue is shared by the M-B entropy concept when properly applied. However, the disadvantage (for Griinbaum) of the coarse-grained approach is that it allows a demonstration that entropy increases for the process. Grtinbaum then must modify his own claim and distinguish between Griffith's 'generalised entropy' which increases and the 'full-blown' M-B entropy which is not definable. It is my contention that this is an unnecessary confusion of the issue and that Griinbaum, if he would only embrace the M-B statistics, can show that the process involves no increase of entropy, i.e., it is non- entropic in that strict sense. 1 Griinbaum [1974], p. 780.</page><page sequence="8">320 Michael J. Zenzen In his [1973] Grtinbaum distinguishes between the partition-dependent, non-punctal coarse-grained kind of microstate and the precise microstate which is independent of the partitioning of phase space.' After an extensive analysis of examples he concludes: Although the direction of the entropy change exhibited by a single system. .. is indeed relative to the chosen partition, no such relativity to the chosen partition characterizes the statistics of entropy change in the specified ensembles of sys- tems. For there is an invariance in the entropic behavior of a majority of the systems . .2 These remarks are significant to our discussion in two ways. First, when taken together with the above-mentioned distinction between coarse- grained microstate and punctal microstate, they suggest that coarse- graining is most appropriate when dealing with ensembles of systems and that, when so used, coarse-graining allows one to overcome the partition- dependence of entropy for single systems. Tolman's [1938] discussion supports the view that coarse-graining is properly associated with ensembles of systems.3 Secondly, while it is true that the direction of entropy change for a coarse-grained single system is partition dependent, this will not be the case for the precise, punctal description of statistical mechanics which involves no partitioning. However, it should be noted that there are various levels of punctal description. Thus, one might use the one-particle distribution function, the two-particle distribution function etc. in calculating entropies.4 It is true, as Grtinbaum notes,5 that the n-particle distribution function, f"(), if used in the calculation for entropy will always yield an entropy which is constant in time (the fine-grained or Gibbs entropy). But this does not mean we are forced to choose between some sort of coarse-grained entropy and the fine-grained entropy associated with f(n). We can, in fact, work with the one particle distribution function of the two particle distribution function etc. and these do not, in general, yield an entropy which is constant in time. 1 Griinbaum [1973], p. 649. In this essay Grtinbaum is concerned to defend "coarse- grained entropy" against charges that it is anthropomorphic. However, Grad [I961] and Jaynes [1965] would seem to require such a defence for any concept of entropy since, as Jaynes notes (p. 398), "it is a property, not of the physical system, but of the particular experiments you or I choose to perform on it". If entropy is anthropomorphic in this sense then the entire conceptual linkage between temporal anisotropy and entropy needs to be re-thought. The choices seem to be: (i) show some notion of entropy to be free from anthropomorphism and retain the linkage, (2) accept the anthropomorphism and extend it to time, (3) accept the anthropomorphism but sever the conceptual linkage. 2 Grtinbaum [1973], p. 659. 3 Tolman [1938], p. i66. 4 For a discussion of distribution functions and levels of description see Grad [1961], PP. 323-30. Griinbaum [1973], p. 829.</page><page sequence="9">Popper, Griinbaum and de facto Irreversibility 321 An extensive discussion of the relative merits of working with this or that distribution is beyond the scope of this paper.' The most appropriate description for the example considered here is the one based on the one particle distribution function because this is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution which Griinbaum holds up as the standard for the description of entropic processes. We shall show in the next section that the Maxwell- Boltzmann description is applicable and allows for the formal demonstra- tion of constant entropy during an irreversible process. The expansion process under discussion is physically and philo- sophically interesting because the entropy increase associated with the spatial expansion of the system is exactly balanced by the entropy decrease associated with velocity sorting. Because of this unusual circumstance, the entropy production for the process is zero. Choosing the level of description f(l( allows one to show this whereas coarse-graining blurs the physics of the situation. Before leaving this issue I would like to point out an interesting con- nection between coarse-graining and ergodic theory. If we recall the above discussion in which the metrical indecomposability of G was a condition for establishing the equivalence of phase-averages and infinite time- averages, then the independence of coarse-graining from ergodic theory is evident. For suitably chosen coarse-graining allows diffusion across boundaries of what would otherwise be invariant decomposable subsets, thus, automatically (albeit artificially) fulfilling the condition for the metric indecomposability of G. In other words, a system which is (intrinsically) metrically decomposable might be suitably coarse-grained in such a way that this decomposability would be transformed into a kind of operational indecomposability allowing one to show that choice of the natural measure yields phase-averages which are equal to infinite time-averages. 3 A MAXWELL-BOLTZMANN CALCULATION Although an M-B entropy concept is not defined for a system which is infinite initially in extent or in energy or in material content, this is not to say that an M-B entropy cannot be defined for a finite system which is allowed to expand eternally. We begin with the most general definition of entropy S, S = k In Q (I) where 2 is the measure (measure in the technical sense of number or spatial extent in state space) of the set of molecular states which are In a future paper we shall consider the problem of how to select an appropriate descrip- tion and the corresponding entropy.</page><page sequence="10">322 Michael J.

Thus, S=k In W (2) The replacement at equilibrium of the conceptually perfect Q2 by the more calculable W is well-known. The W formulation of entropy can be expressed in terms of the distribution density f(r, v, t) as follows: S = --H (3)1 H= J dr S dpf lnf (4)2 wheref dr dp is the number of molecules with positions in a space-element of volume dr = dx dy dz containing r and with moment in an element of volume dp = dp, dpy dpz containing p.

We are left with (8) in the form: dtS= -k dr dp ln fJ (I0) If we assume the gas is so rarefied that as it expands there are no collisions then, J o and we have: dS dt= (I) and there is no entropy production. Evidently the tendency to produce entropy by expanding into new space is exactly compensated by the tendency to destroy entropy by the sorting of velocities. The careful reader will have noted that while (3) holds at equilibrium (when the actual distribution of particles over single-particle states is equal to the most probable distribution) it is not clear that it will hold away from equilibrium. Thus, away from equilibrium, the M-B entropy may not be correct. However, its correctness or applicability is distinct from its definability. In this example it happens that applicability seems tied to difficulties with defining a "final entropy" but the root of the prob- lem is the non-equilibrium character of the process. The fact that the system does not reach a new equilibrium is not a relevant consideration; even if it did, this would not resolve the problem of the disparity between actual and most probable distributions away from equilibrium. A final observation: Although the M-B entropy may not be applicable to the process, presumably, among the many which can be defined, there is one which is. In the absence of arguments which show the sole relevance of the M-B entropy as a criterion there remains an interesting question: Of the applicable entropies which, if any, is relevant as a criterion for de facto irreversibility and is its constancy in time necessary or sufficient?
