<plain_text><page sequence="1">Polity * Volume XXXVI, Number 3 * April 2004 "Dreaded and Dared": Courage as a Virtue* Nancy L. Schwartz Wesleyan University This paper analyzes the idea of courage in ancient Greek and Jewish thought in order to find a contemporary meaning. Does courage exist, what is its relation to fear, and does a courageous soul struggle for self-mastery or achieve harmony? I examine Plato and Aristotle for Greek thought, the Hebrew Bible and some rabbis for Jewish thought, and Maimonides who combined both traditions. The courage of the citizen and member, of the philosopher and prophet, and public arenas for courage, are compared. The key theme is the question of fear and courage-the role of courage in encountering fear and the role of fear in engendering courage. Whereas Greek thought sought to overcome fear with a higher love, Jewish thought overcame earthly fear with a higher fear. The place of such awe or devo- tion in modern secular life is explored. Nancy L. Schwartz is Professor of Government at Wesleyan University, Mid- dletown, CT She has written The Blue Guitar: Political Representation and Com- munity, co-edited Friends and Citizens, and published articles on Marx, Weber, equality, and political representation in Israel. In 1964, three American civil rights workers-James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner-disappeared and were found weeks later buried in an earthen dam. They were called courageous after their deaths. My family were friends of the Goodmans, and I remember wondering at the time and ever since: is "courageous" a judgement we apply after the fact of a heroic action? Were these men courageous at the time? and before, in the decision to go? Is courage a virtue that exists, and can we see and understand it in the same way as a virtue like liber- ality or justice? And, too, has courage generally vanished in a modern democratic age, replaced by gentler, less heroic virtues? Courage involves acting well in the face of danger to the self. This provisional definition requires considerable development in deciding what acting well means, what constitutes danger, and how one defines the self. Even "in the face of" needs *1 thank the following people for their comments on this project: J.

While "danger" and "in the face of" raise questions about what knowl- edge is required for courage, the "acting well" and "self" parts depend on what eth- ical context one is operating in. And in addition to the reasons and context involved in courage, there are emotions-what are these desires and feelings? Contrast to my practical definition of courage, a more philosophical one: courage is "knowledge of what is to be dreaded or dared," said Nicias in Plato's dia- logue the Laches.' In the Protagoras, Socrates suggested it is "knowledge of what is and is not to be feared."2 Courage here has first to do with knowing and only later, if then, with action. The knowledge concerns what one should be scared of. Danger is naturally scary, a threat to the self. What is dangerous? Are some things appro- priate to fear and some not? Are there other things to fear besides danger? Does this definition imply that if one had great knowledge and a different sense of self and the world, then nothing would be fearful? Did Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner feel fear? at the time? before, when they were planning their trip to Mississippi? If they had lived, would they have felt fear after being run off the road, and would this have made them come home? How would the attack affect their subsequent actions? As citizens in the civil rights move- ment, they took great risks. How are we, who live in a polity and wish to serve it, to feel when we experience risks to the self? Can we encounter fear (and anxiety, its complicated cousin) and act well? This essay is about the question of fear in courage: how does fear help or hinder courage? Can we stand fear? We will exam- ine the role of courage in encountering fear and also, paradoxically, the role of fear in engendering courage. Courage as a virtue of character figured more centrally in classical than modern thought. Hannah Arendt, in her exaltation of the Greeks in The Human Condition, considered it a central virtue of political life. The "virtue of courage [is] one of the most elemental political attitudes"; in ancient Greek political thought it "became the political virtue par excellence."3 How was courage related to political life, and what was a citizen's stance towards fear-did he wish to avoid it, control, and overcome it? Political thought in the west had its origins in Athens and other city-states, in the pre-Socratics, then Plato and Aristotle; their theorizings dominated European politi- cal thought even as it began to react against the Philosopher in the sixteenth cen- tury. I will start by exploring several Greek ideas of courage--concepts of it in war and peace, and consider the challenge Plato's Socrates posed to these traditions. Socrates sought (or effortlessly achieved?) an overcoming of fear. I seek to appreci- ate the power of this achievement, as well as ask if it has limitations. 1. Plato, Laches, trans. W R. M.

Did Jewish thought seek to banish, master, and overcome fears? How did the prophets and rabbis understand human fear? Even though western political thought transvalued Jewish and Greek concep- tions when Christianity rose to dominance, older ideas of courage persisted. I will examine some ancient Israelite conceptions of courage in war, and peace and exile, and then return to the founding moment of Abraham. Abraham and Socrates rep- resent contrasting responses to the problem of fear. While I acknowledge some similarities between Abraham and Socrates' courage, the differences are more sig- nificant for my argument. I will be asking how a human being manages to face danger and uncertainty with dignity; uncertainty introduces a new condition of risk to the self, and dignity can mean acting or comporting oneself well. Each tradition, of Athens and Jerusalem, enabled certain individuals to be courageous by understanding their hopes and fears in distinctive ways and encouraging them to seek noble or digni- fied ends and means. Each political culture had a high estimation of courage among the virtues yet with a different idea of how courage encounters fear and what constitutes the public sphere of life, the arena where courage can appear. I will suggest that the alternative reading can help craft a concept appropriate to political life today. I. Greek Political Thought Courage in ancient Greek thought started out as a manly virtue exhibited mainly in war. The Greek word for courage, andreia, meant manliness or the quality of a man, virility, and was related to aner, a real man; someone who was unmanly was anandron.5 The "military conception of courage ... [moved from that] of the aris- tocratic warrior... [to] the willingness of the citizen-soldier to stand and fight in the phalanx battleline."6 The soldier required courage not so much in offense but in defense and retreat. Plato's Socrates was credited with possessing this virtue in battle (Symp. 219e-221b).7 4.

Courage did involve practical wisdom, one of the intellectual virtues in Aristotle. Yet courage was not purely intellectual since it concerned human action and involved the emotions. Some emotions were similar in all people and some were different, and practical wisdom involved judgment about the external world as well as knowledge of one's own hopes and fears. I will introduce Aristotle before Plato because Aristotle was more explicit about the emotions, while Plato heightened the intellectual element. Aristotle based his discussion of courage on the experience of the soldier (Nic. Eth. 11 15a).'0 A soldier risked his life in battle on behalf of a good end, the preser- vation of a community. Since the danger in fighting was great, a soldier had to be trained to face danger and the natural fear it entailed. Courage did not have to con- sist in one extraordinary action, and was the result of long and consistent educa- tion, forming a habitual disposition to act and feel in a certain way (1103b). In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle developed his doctrine of the mean, stating that a virtuous action and accompanying feeling fall at a mid-point between two extremes of action and feeling-that of too much and too little. A courageous man acts in a manner midway between brashness and timidity (1 106a-1 107b). Courage, like all the virtues, involved acting in the right way, at the right time, for the right reason (1115b). The courageous person had to have noble ends, and these were in large part defined by the political community."1 Plato and Aristotle considered nobility to be the right reason for a courageous action. The requirement of nobility as an end had consequences for the role of fear in courage, since aspirations to nobility and for honor, its social form, helped define who the self was and what constituted danger. A self was neither isolated nor self-sufficient; courageous selves identified with the 8. Aristotle, distinguishing between the moral and intellectual virtues, in the Nicomachean Ethics, Bks.

Eth. 1115a-b. Socrates questioned whether the noble was identical with the highest good (Laches 193d, 197b-c, 199d-e), but he accepted, to a considerable extent, that social standards of courage reflected nature and hence were true (187a, 192c-d).</page><page sequence="5">Nancy L Schwartz 345 community and with significant communal goals as part of their beings.12 Thus while the boundaries of the self may have expanded, the idea of danger may have correspondingly contracted. For example, a threat to one's life might not be so fear- some if one's honor was also at stake. How one defined the self-its life, identity, loyalties, aspirations--determined what constituted true danger. Courage involved the capacity to act nobly in the face of danger to the self. The arena in which courage appeared had to be a public one. This meant, of course, that the external behavior of a courageous person might be more significant than his internal motivation and feelings, and hence we might never know his fear. Aristotle maintained, however, that external behavior was not the sum of courage, and that all the virtues involved encountering one's own characteristic fears and temptations. By having a strong sense of what was natural to humans,'3 Plato and Aristotle could assume that a soldier in battle would feel fear even if he did not show it, since his life was at stake and loss of life a great danger. So courage in ancient Greek thought had to occur in social and public life, arenas in which nobility could be seen. These were distinguished from the private world of the household, also part of the regime. In public, a citizen appeared and was seen by others; he performed actions, whether in deeds or speech, and was recognized, in his tradition or creativity, by fellow citizens." The soldier and civilian performed actions that were fine and honorable, as opposed to what was base or shameful. Social standards of honor derived from political society and required that the actors be free (so they could have chosen to do otherwise) and equal (compa- rable in their capacities and responsibilities). These conditions existed outside the household, wherein were relegated women, children, and slaves.' If someone faced a threat to the existence of the self in private life, antiquity was apt to consider it as endurance but not courage. Plato questioned this under- standing, raising the possibility of courage in facing "shipwreck, sickness and poverty" (Lach. 191 d). Aristotle commented that these misfortunes certainly bring terrors, but they were not situations that evoked full courage because they did not involve freely chosen humanly noble ends (Nic. Eth. 1115a27-1115b6). For humans, material survival was necessary but not noble; survival is usually, but not always, a necessary precondition to nobility. The patience characterizing endurance in the private realm of the household was a quality only later traditions 12. In this I am differing from Ward who sees nobility in Aristotle as independent of politics even though Ward grants that the city projects a standard of nobility. "Nobility and Necessity," 79-80. 13.

Ancient Greek literature did not value private virtues equally with public ones, nor acknowledge that courage could occur in peace as well as war. While the heroes of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Achilles and Odysseus, showed bravery in battle, Odysseus had merely "endurance and the will to resist ... inward passions and ... misfortune.. ." during peacetime.'7 Plato challenged the aristocratic warrior tradition and began to explore conflicts occurring within the soul of man, who lives with diverse desires and fears. One of Plato's early dialogues, the Laches, was ostensibly about courage in war and more generally concerned education of the next generation in peacetime. The dialogue points to courage as a form of moral knowledge, and sets the stage for Aris- totle's and then our central question of whether and how courage encounters fear. In the Laches, Socrates' two main discussants were military men, generals in the Peloponnesian War. They differed in their actions, beliefs, and characters. Laches was more solid and commonsensical, and his deep loyalty to the civic community helped give him an "endurance of the soul" when confronted by danger of death or defeat (Lach. 192b). Nicias was more volatile and intellectual, and his attempts to master events-and his own fear-through foreknowledge and skill gave him an aura of activity and control. In conversation with Socrates, Nicias defined courage as "the knowledge of what is to be dreaded or dared, either in war or in anything else" (195a). Yet Nicias had at times delayed out of prudence and perhaps fear, manifest- ing excessive caution and piety in war; it was well-known in Athens that Nicias's hes- itancy led to defeat at Syracuse.'8 Nicias seems smarter than Laches and is better at parrying Socrates' questions; Laches is slower than Nicias yet persistent and zealous in his search and his respect for Socrates. Ultimately, Nicias's rather shallow and technical cleverness is rejected, and instead the earlier working alliance between Socrates and Laches takes them, and us, to an aporia of the dialogue-a point, towards the end, where they acknowledge they do not know (199e-200b).'9 This perplexity points to courage as a form of moral knowledge, deeper than the mental techniques of a soothsayer or an expert20 and higher than the steadfastness of a watchdog.21 Courage as a virtue involved knowledge of the self as well as 16.

In a middle dialogue the Pro- tagoras, Plato's Socrates proposed that courage consists in "knowledge of what is and is not to be feared" (Protag. 360d). Did this make courage into an intellectual virtue, knowledge of the higher forms freeing us from fear of natural and social dan- gers? Socrates suggested the unity of the virtues and that all virtue is "a single whole, knowledge" (361b). This knowledge then, wisdom about what is good and evil, might not be solely intellectual and instead involved the "soul as a whole."22 The auxiliaries in Plato's Republic achieved right opinion-of the ends for which they guarded-from rulers who possessed more reason. Commentators have remarked that for Plato, this knowledge, of what is to be dreaded and dared, had to be joined with "virtuous behavior" or "right action."23 Even with external guidance, the guardians had to overcome their fears in order to manifest courage. The Repub- lic deemed bravery possible when "high spirit preserves in the midst of pains and pleasures the rule handed down by reason as to what is or is not to be feared (Rep. 422c).24 The Republic, and Plato's later work the Laws, and Aristotle's writings as well, kept courage as a moral virtue, one that encounters fear. Mastery or Harmony? The encounter with fear could take several forms. For the encounter to success- fully issue in courage, the initial fearful danger had to be a possible, not solely imag- ined, threat to one's existence and loyalties. Moreover, to not feel fear at all in the face of danger to the self was a sign of inexperience and foolhardiness, not virtue. The common way of managing fear (other than avoidance and flight) was self- control. A person attempted to control or master his fear in light of other purposes he had. One struggled with fear, trying to subdue and subordinate it, to keep it from overwhelming one's judgment and action. This form of self-control as continence was not highly valued by Plato or Aristotle. Plato gave a fairly unsavory account of the oligarchic man, his niggardliness as a result of struggle with his passions, in book VIII of the Republic. The battle in one's soul was only temporarily won and continually repeating; it wore one down and led to deficiencies of character. Aristo- tle stated that virtue was not simply self-restraint (Nic. Eth. I146a). For them, virtue was not a constant struggle for self-mastery. Instead, they proposed another way to encounter fear, one that tried to over- come, in the sense of transcend, the fearful. They tried to articulate an ideal of a har- mony in the soul, beyond conflict. Aristotle argued that courage as a moral virtue 22. Wilson Carey McWilliams, Letter to author, December 30, 1994.

Thus courage was not solely a matter of mastering fear. Did this mean that one did not feel any fear to begin with? Then the occasion for courage would be danger faced without fear, and they rejected this condition as unnatural. The question, then, was what qualities of the soul enabled it to deal in a harmonious way with the fear that danger evoked. There seemed to be two qualities of a soul, in addition to its reason and desires, that might help it feel and act courageously-confidence and spiritedness. Aristotle wrote of the confidence (tharsos) accompanying a courageous act:25 confidence being a sense of assuredness, a feeling that one's own powers could meet circum- stances successfully. But confidence seemed to be a weaker and blander motivation than spiritedness. In Aristotle's discussion of courage as a mean between extremes of more and less, some have discerned two continua rather than one.26 There was a con- tinuum whose mean was cautious confidence and whose extremes were overcaution and rashness, and a continuum whose mean was bravery and whose extremes were cowardice and insensitive fearlessness (Nic. Eth. 1115b-1116a). The second contin- uum acknowledged the role of fear in hindering or helping courage. If Aristotle con- flated the two scales,27 perhaps this was because the first continuum was not rich enough to capture the role of fear in courage and the role of spiritedness in its over- coming. Confidence was not strong enough to overcome fear once it arose. Spiritedness was a quality of soul deemed strong enough to quell fear. In Plato's Republic, where courage was one of the four central virtues, spirit (thumos) char- acterized the guardians of the city (Rep. 375a-c, 429a-d). Spirit was a vitality of mind and outlook, a motivation with energy and a cognitive element. Animated yet con- stant and not volatile, spirit loved action as well as standing firm. Spirit occupied a place in the soul, mid-way between reason and appetite; spirit was properly a ser- vant of reason and was a passionate feeling; it had aspects of what would later be called the will. Aristotle wrote of the importance of spirit, and a recent interpreter finds that, "Spiritedness ... is the natural and passionate basis of courage."28 High spirit seemed somewhat akin to anger, anger at whatever came between the soul and its natural and chosen ends. Righteous anger characterized the coura- geous person who faced a threat to his or her life and activities. Partly akin to the rage or indignation some animals seem to have, spirit breathed life into one's chosen activities. A modern writer on courage and thumos tries to explain that, 25.

There is also a sense in which fear itself as an emotion could contribute to acting well. This aspect of courage was only glanced at in Greek tradition and developed more extensively in Judaism. Here, several commentators on Aristotle suggested that fear need not be devastating; "felt in the right way," fear does not immobilize. Fear could serve as a warning of danger and a spur to protective or corrective action. For fear was inextricably linked to hope, and fear could galvanize a person into action to achieve that hope.30 The Greek view of courage sought to overcome the negative experience of fear with more positive feelings. Courage was a mani- festation of positive spirit mobilized by fear. The feeling of fear seemed to be an inherent part of a courageous act, except in the limiting case of Socrates. His experience with fear, or without it, can be seen as the highest stage in a progression sought by Plato. The internal dynamics of Socrates' courage displayed tendencies we have remarked on earlier, taken to an extreme; they were not discontinuous with earlier developments. Plato's courage was philosophical, based on reason, yet at the same time it was emotional, based on an intense desire that went beyond thumos. In depicting Socrates' philosophic courage, Plato moved the farthest from the military courage of the warrior and also modified the civic courage of the citizen. The warrior feared defeat and disgrace more than death. The citizen learned to fear dishonor and loss of community more than death. Although Socrates had been a soldier, he chose to avoid further public office. As a philosopher, he occupied a posi- tion that was semi-public, not solely private, for he entered into dialogue with people he met, and his condemnation and death were public events.31 He consid- ered his existence to centrally involve doing philosophy in the city and he sought to preserve this self from danger. One's existence, he argued in the Apology, involved one's position, whether in war or philosophy (Apol. 28c-e). This was given by one's natural talents (or by temporary assignment by the city), although how a person interpreted his calling left considerable latitude within these limits. "When a man 29.

(28d).32 Did Socrates feel fear? He seemed not to fear death to his body, since he did not know if death was an evil (Apol. 29a-b, 40b-41d, 42). He alluded to Achilles as a hero who made light of death compared to dishonor (28c-e), yet that passage in the Iliad (18.94-106) as well as others suggest that Achilles' wrath may have masked his natural "fright" (20.262) at an "untimely death" (24.540).33 While Socrates was not young when condemned, the political nature of the judgment against him could be seen to make his death untimely since it was before its natural time. Socrates also suggested that after death there might be another life of the soul. If he believed in an afterlife, then this might lessen his natural fear. If Socrates did not fear death, he also did not fear social disgrace or dishonor, since he did not accept that social standards of honor were always the highest. In the Laches he questioned the idea of courage as "remaining at one's post" (Lach. 190e-191e); there might be reasons to desert one's post. Whether Socrates feared the community's political condemnation is more controversial; certainly his deci- sion to drink the hemlock rather than go into exile suggested a dedication to the laws of Athens and concern for the long-run reputation of philosophy (Crito 48a, c- d, 49e).34 Socrates seemed to imply that what he truly feared was ignorance and doing wrong, but somehow we feel that while he disapproved of ignorance and sought to do right, in some essential sense he was fearless. Yet we cannot say that Socrates was not brave, even if he faced danger without fear (Phaedo 116c- 118).3s A way out of this paradox might be that in Socrates, fear was transformed. Fear of death or social disfavor was transmuted into fear of ignorance and an ability to risk encountering the unknown.36 For him, the drive to know and love what is beau- tiful in another, and ultimately to know the form of beauty itself, were passions stronger than fear of the unknown. His rational desire for knowledge of the forms or ideas of justice and the good were so strong they left fear of natural and social things behind. If part of the truth were terrible, Socrates faced it in a courageous spirit of "genuine inquiry"37 and strove to put it in a larger context that was harmo- nious. He feared, if anything, missing the opportunity to join with the ideas, the objects of his love.38 But this was more a yearning--a pain, a sadness--than a fear.

As Socrates' eros sought higher objects, it lost some of its possessive and aggressive aspects, becoming less warlike (Symp. 210a-21 Ic). The philosopher was gentle (Rep. 375c, 376c), less conventionally masculine than before.40 In the dialogue with Laches, at an early aporetic point when they realized they did not know, they imagined the laughter of "courage herself" (Lach. 194a). "Manliness herself,"41 the form or idea of courage, was now what they sought, not its particular manifestation in a human soul. The object of their search shifted from "the traditional ancient Greek ideal of manly courage" to a new "feminine, lovely courage"; they felt "the lover's love" for their object.42 And the philosopher desired to become like the beloved.43 The philosopher used eros and thumos to overcome fear.44 Fear was trans- formed by love. II. Jewish Political Thought There was no specific word for courage in ancient Jewish thought. Biblical Hebrew had a variety of ways to express this capacity: chazak meaning strong, firm, hard, oz meant strength or might, ometz meant strong or resolute, and chayil for strength or valor. A soul (nefesh) might be full of spirit (ruach). Ometz lev was a strong or stout heart, site of the mind and the will, and when one became faint- hearted, hearts melted. A strong man was gibbor. The concept underwent a development not unlike that in Greek thought from a military to civilian virtue. Old Testament warriors such as Joshua were urged to "be strong and resolute" (Deut. 31.6-7, Josh. 1.6, 7, 9, 18);45 David was "a mighty man of valour, and a man of war" (I Sam. 16.18)46 The very old song of triumph about Deborah, who gave Barak courage and accompanied him into battle, exhorted her soul to march on with strength (Judg. 4.8, 5.21). Centuries after the bible was redacted, as the rabbis completed reading each book in the Torah cycle, they would say "from strength to strength" (chazak v'chazak).47 40.

If courage had been the direct result of divine intervention, then there would be no occasion for human judging and willing in dangerous situations. God would decide who would be strong and who weak, and could banish all fears. But courage was not directly revealed, and involved human choice and grappling with the emotions. The bible and the rabbis saw courage as an ethical virtue with some spiritual elements. Unlike Aristotle, they did not necessarily consider virtue to be at a mean or midway point; sometimes virtue itself could go to an extreme. And unlike Plato, they did not always value harmony as higher than self-mastery. They found a different way from the Greeks of facing the fear in one's soul. I will consider the rabbis along with the bible because they were more explicit about the intention and emotions in a person acting, while the bible tended to stress the deed itself and leave the motivation implicit. I will also consider Maimonides who as a rabbi and philosopher tried to bridge the Jewish and Greek traditions. At first it appears that the Israelite warrior was courageous with the same traits as the Greek soldier. He had a naturally warm heart, leading to a spirited tem- perament.48 He underwent some military training, leading to habitual responses in crises. He followed a higher authority, although not from philosophic reason but from divinely anointed political leaders and from God. Even the talented and unruly David did not rely solely on military skill for victory. As a young man he said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail within him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine" (I Sam. 17.32), and announced "that all this assembly may know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's. . ." (17.47). David still had to use a weapon, albeit a small one; his faith in the Lord encour- aged his fighting spirit but did not determine the outcome. David spoke of men's hearts: the will as well as the mind were considered to lodge in the heart. The quality of a man's heart was key (16.7). It contained his judgment and defined whom or what he trusted to obey. In biblical narratives, "What is important ... is human will confronted with alternatives which it may choose on its own or submit to divine determination.""49 The belief in a relation to this God could push virtue into extremes, departing from an ideal of the mean. Certain human virtues were said to be imitations of divine qualities, even if in a metaphoric and not anthropomorphic way.50 One could 48.

Three virtues were central: loving-kindness and mercy (chesed), judgment and justice (mishpat) and righteousness (tzedakah) (Exod. 34.6-7; Jer. 9.23, Mic. 6.8). In imitating these "ways of God" human beings could go to extremes.5' A chasid was an extremely pious and humble man whose steadfast love and mercy abounded.52 A tzaddik was an extremely righteous man who went beyond the letter of the law into acts of freeflowing piety and justice.53 When courage was an aspect of loving care, justice, and righteousness, it could go to extremes of feeling and action. The behavior of Jewish martyrs who exhibited dig- nity in the midst of destruction may have contained a courage that inclined towards rashness. The courageous self had both human and divine ends, and these were in large part defined by the religious community. The individual entered a way of life- linked in a covenantal relation to the deity and living in a community governed by law. This covenantal relation modified the definition of self and changed the scale of acceptable risks, so that preserving a way of life rather than an individual might be a goal of courageous action. Preservation of an individual life was a central value, such that "if any man saves alive a single soul, Scripture imputes it to him as though he had saved a whole world" (Sanhedrin 4, 5-6).54 An individual had value, whether Jewish or Gentile, righteous or unrighteous: to save a sick person one could violate laws prohibiting work on the Sabbath.55 The religious community also had value, since through it one enacted one's soul and praised God. After the exile of the people from the land of Israel, the rabbis modified the biblical stress on warrior courage. In its place came an emphasis on peacetime or exilic courage, fortitude in observing the laws of the Torah, especially in alien environments.56 The people of Israel were encouraged to do tasks Joshua had been charged with, to "cause this people to inherit the land" and "to observe to do according to all the law" (Josh.

A community as a way of life may go into exile or diaspora and live among others. This changes its organization of political power and the role of military defense and courage. A community might be political in the sense of having rules of gov- ernance and modes of re-interpretation even if it did not possess a territorially-bounded state. The rabbis acknowledged this change from state sovereignty, as did the prophets and the book of Esther.</page><page sequence="14">354 "DREADED AND DARED": COURAGE AS A VIRTUE 1.6-7), both of which required that one be "strong and of good courage." Courage was the capacity to act with dignity in the face of threat or danger to the self, seen as a member of a community. Courage in ancient and medieval Jewish thought did not have to occur in one public sphere of life. While Moses as legislator and political leader addressed an assembly of "all the congregation of the children of Israel" (Lev. 19.2) and the deeds of warriors and words of prophets were known throughout the community, courage as an excellence could also appear in smaller settings. A central public sphere did not define and judge standards of social honor and nobility of persons. The goals of dignity of persons and honor of God were elaborated in a book admin- istered and interpreted by many authorities. Individual deeds could manifest courage in private, since there was considered to be free will and a direct relation to an external judge. Where a public sphere was required for certain acts, it was defined differently than in Greek thought. "In public" meant in the presence of ten male Israelites (a minyan) and this arena was required for rituals, many prayers, and the courage of acts of sanctification of God's Name. Maimonides' reworking of the conditions under which one must uphold a commandment and incur death rather than trans- gress and save a life distinguished between public and private. For all the com- mandments except those against idolatry, inchastity and murder, a person ordered to transgress on pain of death could choose to transgress-since the point was to live, not die, by the commandments-if the order took place privately and at the whim of a tyrant. "But if the attempt to coerce the Israelite to transgress was made in the presence of ten Israelites, he should suffer death and not transgress, even if it was only one of the remaining commandments that the idolater wished him to vio- late" (Mishneh Torah I 5.2, 5.4, 40a-b). The public sphere was a small and decen- tralized one that constituted itself wherever people lived.57 It was composed of men and it viewed the free acts of men and women. Even if God was seen as guarding his people from external danger and encour- aging them in public and private, there remained the problem of human fear. Indi- viduals were told by the Lord not to fear going into battle, and Job in peacetime was told to accept his losses, yet they were still scared. Biblical prophets and psalms sug- gested that what people were actually afraid of was their own transgressions. Past misdeeds could lead to judgment and punishment by God. This was an account of why the Temple had been destroyed--due to the many varied sins of the people (Jer. 30.15). Rabbinic interpretation tended to stress past transgressions and recur- ring punishment as a central cause of fear. The medieval rabbi Rashi commented on a passage in Deuteronomy concerning who should be excused from fighting. A 57.

Rashi first cited Rabbi Akiba for what he called the usual understanding, that such a man was afraid of the sight of a sword and joining the battle ranks. Then at greater length he cited Rabbi Jose the Galilean who said the man's fear was of his own violations. And for that reason the Torah gave him the opportunity that he should (attribute his) return because of a house, or a vineyard, or a wife, in order to cover up for those who return because of the transgressions which are in their hands, so that people should not understand that they are transgressors ... 58 Individuals who offended against the law feared they would receive divine punish- ment in battle. Another example of this guilty fear, as it were, occurred with Jacob in peacetime. Discussing the moral shortcomings of otherwise good men, Mai- monides mentioned the fearfulness of Jacob:59 Jacob was afraid of meeting his brother Esau whom he had deceived (Gen. 32.8, 12). It is interesting that Jacob felt this fear on his own even though he had acted according to God's will in gaining Esau's birthright. Guilt was becoming an individual capacity. In addition to guilt about the past, there was fear of the future. The unknown and uncertain were fearful. There was fear of entering the promised land. The people murmured with misgivings forty years in the wilderness, and the elders themselves may have been afraid to go.60 One story had it that the person who, with courage and belief, first jumped into the water was what ultimately split the sea so the Israelites could escape Pharaoh.6' Later, when Moses sent out spies to scout the land they were to conquer, ten of the twelve spies came back reporting they had seen the enemy who were fierce giants "'and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight"' (Num. 14.1-33). The spies may have been the proximate cause of discouragement62 but ultimately the people them- selves were to blame for their fears (Deut. 1.19-33).63 Biblical writings acknowl- edged that not fearing for the future was an accomplishment. An acrostic poem cel- ebrated a woman of valor (aishet chayil), for whom "Strength [oz] and dignity 58. Rashi, Pentateuch, vol. 5, Deuteronomy, 187, citing Sotah 44 [sic]. See also, Raymond L.

She was not fearful in the present, nor, what is more difficult, did she fear for the future: "And she laugheth at the time to come" (Prov. 31.10-21). How a person encountered his or her fear was a human problem, not solved directly by God. Nor could it be achieved by imagining an imitation of God (imita- tio Del). Courage was a human not divine trait, midway between the natural and divine. For humans, not God, feel fear. Courage for the Hebrews, as for the Greeks,65 raised in acute form the question of whether it was a virtue of self-control or har- mony. Did one battle against fear and surmount it, or did one not feel the fear each time? And which state of the soul was better? A person of strong urges and extreme emotions who mastered them was evalu- ated more highly than a person of modest desires. Greek philosophers, we saw ear- lier, considered true virtue to consist in having neither the negative nor positive desires in excess. Maimonides observed that the rabbis, on the other hand, thought that, someone who craves and strongly desires transgressions [but does not commit them] is more virtuous and perfect than someone who does not crave them and suffers no pain in abstaining from them. They even said that the more virtuous and perfect an individual is, the stronger is both his craving for transgressions and his pain in abstaining from them. (EC, Ch. 6, 79) This person achieved virtue through self-control. Even Maimonides, who sought the Aristotelian mean in virtue, acknowledged and used the extremes. Maimonides wrote of courage as a state of the soul midway between rashness and cowardice (EC, Ch. 4, 67). Neither extreme was good, although in the training of the soul it might be useful to incline towards an extreme, "a little toward rashness" (69). (Cf. Aristotle, Nic. Eth. 1 109b) The way to bring equi- librium to an unbalanced soul was to decide which extreme was easier to incline towards naturally and then practice actions tending in the opposite direction. For a man can more easily turn from extravagance to liberality than from miser- liness to liberality. Likewise it is easier to turn from being insensible to pleasure to being moderate than from being lustful to being moderate. Therefore we make the lustful man repeat actions which lack pleasure more than we make the insensible man repeat lustful actions; we require the coward to practice rash- ness more than we require the rash man to practice cowardice.... (69) 64. Cf. Ps. 104.1. 65. The problem was acute for courage because, while some other virtues such as liberality involved one positive desire and regulating its amount to more or less, courage involved two conflicting desires- spirit or confidence to act well, and the fear that drags one down (see nn. 26 &amp; 27). Cf. von Wright who argues every virtue is of this form, having an opposing emotion that could cause one to act badly.

Acting courageously when one knows what right action is and feels the love of God, even before one feels the internal psychological trait of courage, a person grows into the role.66 The book of Job figured a man who oscillated between extremes. He did not have courage at first but learned a sort of courage, or rather endurance. In his ordeal with God, Job argued and struggled. It turned out his distrust was a threat to the self, although at first he thought God was the threat (9.14-35). When God started taking things away from him, Job reacted with fear (19.27). He alternated between fear and assertiveness (19.23-24, 31.35-37).67 His courage involved internal struggle and he barely mastered his fear. The book of Esther provided a contrasting example of a woman who was coura- geous in a harmonious way. She seemed unconflicted as she risked her self on behalf of her people. Her self was not only her physical life but her chastity and membership in a community. She risked being killed by a wrathful Ahasuerus when she went to him unbidden and revealed her Jewishness, pleading for the Jews. Ear- lier her chastity was compromised when she was taken into custody and awarded to the Persian king. Although at that point she did not know an edict would later be pronounced against the Jews, in general it was a time of religious persecution and she recognized, bravely, that as queen she might be of service to her nation. This narrative was remarkable in mentioning neither God nor Esther's fear and con- tempt. Yet the Septuagint, the early Greek translation of the Old Testament, had additional verses wherein Esther asked the Lord to give her courage and also declaimed against her husband's bed that she loathed (Esth. [Gr.] 14.1, 3-4, 12-16, 19; 15.5). In its austerity, the Hebrew Bible emphasized courage as a human trait, leaving the internal struggle implicit and subject to commentary. Maimonides tried to reconcile what he discerned as the difference between Greek and Jewish sages on harmony versus self-mastery.69 Inquiring into whether the 'virtuous' or the 'continent' man was "better and more perfect" (EC, Ch. 6, p. 78), he thought they applied to two different kinds of law (p. 80). (Courage might be needed in carrying out either kind of law if there were danger such as the wrath of a rival or enemy provoked by an action.) In the first place, the traditional laws or statutes (chukim) specifically from God to the Jewish people, such as prohibitions on mixing meat with milk or linen with wool, and the ceremony with the red heifer, required a continent person who might say, "'I want to [violate the law], but what 66.

But such statutes had to be distinguished from more universal commandments (mitzvot), or the ordi- nances (mishpatim)70-laws more "generally accepted" among peoples, such as the prohibitions against murder and theft and requirements to honor parents and repay benefactors (79-80). A virtuous person would have no desire to transgress these rules; her virtue would reflect the harmony in her soul. This was a creative solution, but did it work? In the effort to reconcile Greek and Jewish thought, was the distinctiveness of each tradition retained and were they really reconciled? Maimonides proposed the ideal virtue was harmony for general laws and self-mastery for Jewish law. I can conceive of situations where there might be internal struggle over the mitzvot, even in an upright man. In acknowledging dreams and fantasies "terrible in their untamed lawlessness" (Rep. 572b),7' Plato rather than Aristotle flagged a recurrent problem of temptation. Too, there might be situations where one good deed came into conflict with another; one would strug- gle internally to come to a judgment of what to do. Even if Maimonides' analysis generally held for daily life, yet when the way of life and identity were threatened, as they often were, there was a need for courageous leadership that might not fall into categories of specific commandments, universal or particular. Political and military necessity could require action outside normative law. People were faced on occasion with unprecedented demands, requiring them to stand, speak, or act-sometimes with their own judgment, sometimes as instru- ments of divine will-in new ways, ways that went beyond their previous experi- ence and acknowledged rules. Job as universal man experienced this challenge, as did Esther as a Jew. The greatest examples were the Hebrew prophets, leaders in extraordinary situations and struggling to master their emotions. The prophets showed courage to a great degree, yet paradoxically they also expe- rienced great fear. Prophets were exceptional individuals who received the word of God through dreams and visions, and foretold the future. According to the medieval poet and scholar Judah Halevi, prophets were morally perfect individuals;72 according to Maimonides, they were intellectually perfect and morally good but not perfect (anger and melancholy sometimes interfered with their prophetic gifts) and then some were chosen to receive divine words.73 In The Guide of the Perplexed, Maimonides wrote that a prophet needed the "faculty of courage" to be "moved in his thought to 70.

Harm might come from a foreign oppressor king or local unjust prince, or it might be the potential rebellion of the Israelites themselves when they were corrupt and did not want to hear the prophet. These two faculties must necessarily be very strong in prophets, I mean the faculty of courage and that of divination. And when the intellect overflows toward them, these two faculties become very greatly strengthened so that this may finally reach the point you know: namely, the lone individual having only his staff, went boldly to the great king in order to save a religious community (or: nation) from the burden of slavery, and had no fear or dread because it was said to him: I will be with Thee (Exod. 3.12). (Guide II 138, 82b-83a) Like Esther, the prophet or prophetess as a single individual bravely confronted kingly power on behalf of the people. Unlike Esther, the prophet more fully partici- pated in the divine intellect and also showed more fear. Jeremiah, for example, exclaimed "Ah, Lord God" and "O Lord" as a sign of anguish in his encounters with the Lord (Jer. 1.6, 14.13, 17.14, 20.7). "All the prophets (when receiving their mes- sages) were filled with fear and consternation and became physically weak. Not so, our teacher Moses..." wrote Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah.74 Prophets became overwhelmed in awe, powerfully moved so they could not fully comprehend their thoughts and emotions. Love or Fear? Why did most of the prophets feel fear amidst their courage? We see here a dif- ferent relation between fear and courage, and between fear and love, than in Greek thought. Was there a single continuum of feeling in courage, in which love and fear were inversely related-the more love, the less fear? Or were love and fear linked together? Whereas in Greek philosophy love helped to surmount fear and leave it behind, in Jewish tradition fear accompanied the love of the highest being and one's highest goals. The relation between this love (ahavah) and its fear (yirah) was complex. "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might" was framed by earlier and later verses to "fear the Lord thy God" (Deut. 6.2, 5, 13). The fear was not simply fear of punishment for one's transgres- sions of the law, although it included that.'7 Beyond this, it was also fear in the broad sense of dread, reverence and wonder, leading to a deep humility (Mishneh Torah I 4.12, 39b). This awe came from the inequality in the situation, in which the other 74.

Perhaps Moses felt less fear because he was the one prophet to whom God spoke "face to face, as ... unto his friend" (Exod. 33.11) which allowed some equal- ity, and also because Moses, according to Maimonides, was the only prophet who was morally perfect, so he did not need to fear the Lord's judgment personally. Although Maimonides wrote about the need to move beyond fear of punishment to love of God and the commandments in themselves (I 10.1-2, 92a-b), fear as an ele- ment of awe remained. Love and fear intertwined and depended on God, yet they also became internal- ized and acquired an independent dynamic within humans. Love of God became love of His Torah and its laws; fear of God became fear of shaming oneself for aban- doning laws and principles. Prayer asked for "confidence to those who yearn for Thee ... [and] hope to those who seek Thee ... [and] renewed strength to the seed of David."''7 It also asked for forgiveness of sins committed "of our own will," done "wittingly or unwittingly."77 The heart thus became the locus of guilt. Guilt and anx- iety at being judged added to fear. Dedication to upholding the commandments and statutes could lead to extreme actions, yet never done with joyful abandon. Despite its transcendent deity, the reli- gion retained a naturalism, a love of the body and earth. Belief in a world to come was not sufficient to overcome the terror and overwhelming sadness of premature natural death, loss of loved ones, and loss of this world. Nor was a belief in the pos- sibility of miracles helpful here. Rashi wrote, And when he surrenders his life, he shall surrender it with the intention of dying; for whoever surrenders his life in anticipation of a miracle, there is not wrought for him a miracle.78 Miracles did not come by asking; they came unbidden. Therefore in a situation of facing unnatural death, a person had to struggle with his or her fears. The feeling of fear seemed to be an inherent aspect of a courageous act, includ- ing the limiting case of Abraham and the binding (akedah) of Isaac. Their experi- ence with fear, or without it, stands at the beginning of the Jewish tradition of fol- lowing divine commandments. Abraham lived after the Noahide commandments and before the covenant at Sinai; the covenant with Abraham gave general and spe- cific commands. The way Abraham and Isaac responded to the awful command of slaughter was characteristic of other human-divine interactions in the tradition; it was an extreme, yet not discontinuous with later developments. Abraham's was an 76. High Holiday Prayer Book, ed. Morris Silverman (Bridgeport, CT: Prayer Book Press, 1951, 1986), 362. 77. Prayer Book, 342-43. 78.

It involved earthly fear, especially by Isaac, and divine fear by them both. Their courage was obedient, based on revealed will, at the same time it was tumultuous, as the ministering angels wept. Commentators seeking to fathom the event, appro- priating it for human understanding, had to assimilate the role of yirah stated else- where in the bible. "'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom"' (Job 28.28) or at least "the beginning of wisdom" (Ps. 9.10, 1.7, 15.33, 111.10). This significant instance of courage was not in war but in peace and depended on Abraham's love and fear of God. Earlier, as Abram, he had fought in battle on behalf of his house, the Hebrews. No qualities of soul were discussed but we know he fought successfully and afterwards the Lord said, "Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, thy reward shall be exceedingly great" (Gen. 14.14-16, 15.1). Entering into a covenant with the Lord on behalf of his people, Abraham and Sarah's reward included a son. In the Akedah, God commanded Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacri- fice. We are not told how Abraham experienced this command, whether he felt dread for his self or son. The risk to physical safety and to the social feelings of parental and filial affection were not mentioned but were hugely implicit. God stayed Abraham's hand, and told him he had met the test, "for... thou art a God- fearing man, seeing that thou hast not withheld thy son, .... from Me" (Gen. 22.12). The idea of the fear of God, fear (yirah)79 as awe, introduced a reverence that trans- formed the nature of human courage. Maimonides argued in the Mishneh Torah that Abraham acted out of love and not fear of punishment, and in the Guide Abra- ham's actions in the Akedah were from both love and holy fear. For Abraham our Father did not hasten to slaughter Isaac because he was afraid that God would kill him or make him poor, but solely because of what is incum- bent upon the Adamites-namely to love Him and fear Him, may He be exalted-and not, as we have explained in several passages, for any hope of a reward or for fear of punishment. (Guide III 24, 54a) What was incumbent upon men was that they be holy as the Lord was holy (Lev. 19.2) and they were not to profane the holy name (Lev. 22.32). The rabbis inter- preted this as the duty of sanctification of the divine Name (kiddush ha-Shem) and against profanation of the Name (chilul ha-Shem). Courage was required to with- stand coercion, even death, in the effort to observe the commandments and not des- ecrate the reputation of God in the world. Rather than violate the prohibitions against idolatry, inchastity, and murder, one should choose death and die with dignity, affirm- 79.

Chronicles from the Middle Ages of Jews who went to their deaths during pogroms and Crusades spoke of the will "to have them endure the yoke of His pure fear," "not to forsake pure fear of Him," "in witness to the Holy and Pure Fear." Rather than commit idolatry or be killed by others, they "pronounced a benediction of martyrdom" and died by their swords.82 "Tenderhearted men also mustered their strength" to do this to their families and " [t]he most gentle and tender of women slaughtered the child of her delight." There were "one thousand 'Akedot on a single day. ... ."" Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn wrote a long poem on the Akedah and contemporary events.84 Bind for me my hands and my feet Lest I be found wanting and profane the sacrifice. I am afraid of panic; I am concerned to honor you, My will is to honor you greatly. This verse captures the nature of the fear that courage surmounts and the nature of the fear that it lives with. III. Contemporary Courage It seems to me that under modern conditions, courage as a harmonious feeling is still possible yet its experience will be different than before. It will not be the moderate mean envisaged by Aristotle. It will be experienced as extreme and idiosyncratic. Yet in the midst of this tumult, the soul expresses a harmony, not a struggle for mastery. Courage, acting well in the face of danger, involves encountering fear and deal- ing with it. Instead of succumbing to fear, one represses or masters or transcends it. Instead of yielding to the desire to flee and desert one's post, thumos overcomes these desires. We have also argued that fear can prompt one into action. 80. See also, Maimonides, "The Epistle on Martyrdom," in Crisis and Leadership: Epistles of Maimonides, trans. Abraham Halkin, disc.

Socrates' insights were accompanied by feel- ings that moved him beyond fear of bodily pain or emotional loss. He could over- come, in the sense of transcend, such dangers and act well because of powerful ideas and emotions. In Jewish tradition, one managed earthly fears through the force of a higher fear, devotion to the divine. Fear of God inspired one to transform the urge to flee. Maimonides posed a contrast between Greek and Jewish thought in terms of harmony versus self-mastery, seeing them as opposed. His resolution depended on a distinction between universal and particular laws in the religious tradition. Yet there is a sense in which Judaism allows a harmony and not just for universal laws. Since fear of God is also love of God, the fear in question-sense of awe, dread at His majesty-is different from the earthly fear of danger. This awe is an extreme emotion, and its courage will not necessarily rest in an Aristotelian mean. If the earthly fear is very great, then an equally strong fear, in the sense of love and awe, might counter-balance it and promote a mean of feeling. Yet it may be the case that yirah will be much stronger than its opposite, especially in a new situation where the person does not have a heritage of fear from the particular danger. Unprece- dented events may evoke either negative or positive feelings in the extreme; we cannot know in advance. A new situation is experienced as extraordinary and brings unfamiliar and untested emotions. If the events are repeated, the feelings may be moderated, as if one were being habituated by training. Then a mean might develop over time, although it would be a different balance in each person. This is so because the modern situation, even within one polity, is so various and unsettled in its values and social groups; whereas Aristotle's ideal depended on a settled context in which shared meanings could affect perceptions, and subjective and objective experiences might agree. Those who were citizens held a certain social status such as being head of a household before enter- ing politics. Aristotle allowed for individual variations in temperament but today to a greater degree, what is valued and fearful to one person is not necessarily so for another. Partly this is due to the extension of citizenship, so that people in diverse social situations are participants in the polity. Partly it is due to the fact that political life itself, especially in liberal republics compared to civic republican or communi- tarian ones, is less active in forming this particular virtue of character. For the contemporary virtue of courage, an extreme of feeling may be necessary. Plato was aware of this and the rabbis explicit about it. Socrates' relation to philos- ophy and the holy fear of the Jews point towards an overarching love. Not all people, however, can be philosophers. Socratic courage, being fearless in the face of the unknown, requires more desire and more philosophy than most of us possess. Plato's theory of human nature and society saw only a few men and women as having such exceptional gifts and opportunities. Is courage, then, restricted to the intellectually gifted?</page><page sequence="24">364 "DREADED AND DARED": COURAGE AS A VIRTUE In the alternative religious tradition, the many can experience holy fear. Awe permeates a way of life in rules and gestures of daily piety;85 beliefs and practices are accessible to all community members.86 Such feeling may lead to religiously inspired courage, where one puts oneself at risk for familial well-being and social justice.87 Holy awe can also lead to violence to others, in service of what is per- ceived as God's will.88 Can there be courage in those who are neither religious nor philosophic? Niet- zsche and Weber thought that courage only began at this point. To make courage a virtue that might do without a belief in God or the absolute ideas, the object of devo- tion has to become human. Whether we can have awe in a secular world is a ques- tion. Certain ideals--justice, kindness or charity, and righteousness or integrity- can inspire secular awe. As moderns, we seek justice, even as it is an essentially contested concept and people argue about its meaning. Kindness is less problem- atic and is widely valued, although not always uncontroversial. Integrity is difficult to define because of the complex demands of politics; achieving it, as in Weber's notion of responsibility, inspires respect. Citizens aspire to define and live by these ideals, which live on in political memory, in Arendt's sense of stories that can be retold. Love of the ideas and fear of deserting one's principles are secular forms of devotion. When Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner acted, it was out of love and fear for such principles. We do not know how they felt amidst danger. We have glimmers of knowing how some people felt and acted when the World Trade Center was attacked Sep- tember 11. Of civilians who helped, some like Giann Gamboa, drew on Catholicism. Others, including Ken Cubas and Frank Doyle, summoned secular resources. I 85.

Even for men with an official role or some training for the task, such as Joseph Amatuccio and Mitchel Wallace, one gets the sense they acted from an extraordinary rush of feeling, manifested as a calm caring."9 Modern courage appears in the larger and smaller publics of our lives. It can be shown in political struggle, social service, and childbearing, as in war, insofar as there is a choice about the ends and an arena of people to view the means. The people who view the act might not be present at the time; an act might live on in a community's storytelling. The public sphere has expanded from city-state to civil society, and acts of courage can occur in leadership, activism and resistance. Courage may be especially needed in deliberative democracy, where dialogue can risk the self. If one exposes one's values and identity to discussion and listens to others in an open way, self-identifications may be challenged. Women and men may experience challenges differently, given the different senses of self and gender. Our characteristic hopes and fears-yearning for, and fear of, autonomy and inti- macy--can take different forms while seeking wholeness."9 All forms of courage encounter fear; it is part of a courageous act. Fear is a nat- ural reaction to danger. What, for humans, is real danger?-"the endless originality of human loss.""9 Courage strives to manage sadness and panic at the prospect of loss; it strives for dignity. Yet too, there is Abraham who, on the morning of the Akedah, rose early and went to saddle his ass (Gen. 22.3). The rabbis commented, he saddled his ass himself! even though he had servants to do it. "Love disregards dignity!" ". ... for love upsets the rule (of dignified conduct)." "Bound ... by a knot of love, that outweighed dignity."92 Despite her high place, courage is one among the virtues, and not always the highest value. 89. Howell Raines, et al., Portraits 9/11/01.
