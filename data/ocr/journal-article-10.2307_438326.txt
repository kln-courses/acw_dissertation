<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sudden Bridegroom: The Dialectic of Lord Weary's Castle WILLIAM E. DORESKI Keene State College When Randall Jarrell in 1947 called Robert Lowell's poetry "essentially post- or antimodernist," he meant that Lord Weary's Castle, Lowell's sec- ond book, summarized and attempted to move beyond the rhetorical and aesthetic achievement of a strain of poetics defined by T. S. Eliot, who was at that time the epitome of modernism for both Lowell and Jarrell; he further noted that Lowell had organized his poems so that their wrenched "dramatic, dialectical internal organization" strained against traditional forms.1 Though Jarrell does not develop its social and rhetorical implications, the latter observation points to the larger significance of Lowell's book: it is one of the major efforts of his gen- eration to engage the aesthetic, rhetorical, and social consequences of the internal contradictions of modernism, which it expresses by im- posing traditional iconography (Christian and Catholic) on a narrative of insistent skepticism. This skepticism is not merely social or cultural but linguistic and derives from Lowell's doubts, made explicit only many years later, about the adequacy of his chosen medium. Lowell's relentlessly intelligent poetry exposed cultural and societal tensions that prevented him from accepting the poetic inheritance re- ceived from Eliot, Hart Crane, and Alien Tate. These tensions are readily discernible in his first book, Land of Unlikeness (1944); but in revising poems from this small-press collection for his second book Lowell modulated and carefully directed competing bodies of imagery to create a heightened aesthetic effect.2 The resultant exposure of the cultural and psychological anxiety underlying the Anglo-American 1.

Doreski o The Sudden Bridegroom modernist project appears most characteristically in Lord Weary's Castle as a series of figural wrenchings of conventional religious iconogra- phy. This anxiety derives from Lowell's perception of the fragmenta- tion of systems of religious, social, and cultural order as well as from his inability to assert, as Eliot does, a faith in the possible renewal of such systems through the efficacies of language. Later, in Life Studies (1959), Lowell would personalize this anxiety and devise what Harold Bloom subsequently termed the "trope of vulnerability" by replacing the archetypal voice of Lord Weary's Castle with a more personal lyric voice and by devising figures of self-exposure to replace the religious and societal metaphors of the early work.3 In History (1973) Lowell would expose his desire for a nihilistic language of unmitigated pas- sion, "words meat-hooked from the living steer."4 Still later, in Day by Day (1977), he would openly interrogate himself about the kind of language for which he had searched all through his career and con- clude ruefully that "Mallarme . . . had the good fortune / to find a style that made writing impossible."5 But the poetics of Lord Weary's Castle, still torn between high modernism and unvoiced psychoseman- tic desires, precluded such direct expression of aesthetic anxiety. As defined by Eliot's poetic practice and criticism, Anglo-American literary modernism critiques but does not entirely reject the post- Renaissance continuum of literary, religious, or social tradition. It strains between the desire to embrace tradition and the desire to dis- place it, as some of Eliot's early poems do, by privileging the speak- ing voice of an individual consciousness devoid of traditional religious and social convictions. Lowell's work is tempered by exposure to Crane's encomia to the machine age, William Carlos Williams's nihilistic view of history, and Tate's sonorous nostalgia. In exposing the paradox of Eliot's position, Lowell's slightly revisionary stance suggests how the modernist social and aesthetic critique, despite its reactionary tendencies, barely resists cultural promiscuity and aesthetic nihilism. The strain against ni- hilism on the one hand and reaction on the other colors the tonalities Lowell revised for Lord Weary's Castle.

His speakers cannot deny their perceptions and ex- perience, but feel compelled to struggle against the precipitous de- scent into apparent cultural anarchy represented by the elevation of tropes of experience over tropes of religion and literary tradition. In my usage the familiar rhetorical term 'trope' assimilates Bloom's psychohistorical definition of "a figure of will rather than a figure of knowledge," a rhetorical manifestation of either the poet's translation of the will "into a verbal act or figure of ethos" or the will's failure "to translate itself" that results in "verbal desire or figure of pathos."6 Trope, then, is a dialogic rhetorical figure that attempts to persuade both reader and speaker-a figure that may be as powerful in its failed form as in its fulfillment. It consists of an image, groups of images, or a coherent body of imagery, but whether the images function meta- phorically (in the traditional sense), symbolically (linking the concrete and the ineffable), or contextually (deriving their meaning from im- mediate experience) determines whether the poem sustains, critiques, or rejects the religious, social, and literary traditions Eliot traced into this century. Because trope is a figure of will, desire, or pathos, it may well work against the apparent intention of the author (as a function of knowledge rather than will) and it may better represent his psycho- logical or sexual needs than his spiritual or intellectual ones. It may also represent a clash among conflicting needs. Derived by Eliot from a strong body of urban poetry by Charles Baudelaire and Jules Laforgue, and built upon a powerful rhetorical development extending from William Shakespeare through Robert Browning, the tropes of modern- ism are adequate means for translating will into verbal act and for func- tioning as figures of ethos, or willed presence. The will to undo one's psychological bondage to the past without utterly rejecting its aesthetic efficacy shapes the poetics of Eliot, Ezra Pound, Williams, and Crane. Lord Weary's Castle derives its dialogic power through opposing yet complementary rhetorical strategies that bear complex cultural, per- sonal, and political implications. The tropes of modernism attempt to persuade the reader that the text's relationship to the past is con- tinuous but problematic in some new way, that the voice of the text does not merely speak for tradition but critiques it.7 The tropes gen- erated in Lord Weary's Castle overcome the modernist aesthetic, how- ever, by confronting it with certain of its consequences, especially by 6. Harold Bloom, "Poetic Crossing: Rhetoric and Psychology," in Poetics of Influence (New Haven, Conn., 1988), p. 161. 7. T. S. Eliot, in "Tradition and the Individual Talent," in The Sacred Wood (London, 1920), defines tradition as involving "the historical sense," and argues that "the historical sense involves a perception not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence." Fur- ther, "it is at the same time what makes a writer most acutely conscious of his place in 354</page><page sequence="4">William E. Doreski o The Sudden Bridegroom exposing the irrationality and inadequacy of faith. The resultant aes- thetic critique struggles with the will to reject the modern subject and reveal the failure of modernist cultural, literary, and social history to individuate the present by adequately distinguishing it from the past.8 This conflict originates with Eliot as the central paradox of Anglo- American modernism, which wants to both retain and reject the com- forting structural constants of the past. The unintended irony with which Lowell in his review of Four Quartets describes Eliot's poetic movement in terms of a geometrical solipsism proves symptomatic of this paradoxical conflict: "Probably the contemplative's life, as dis- tinguished from his separate acts, can only be dramatized by a circu- lar and thematic structure. His actions, unlike the tragic hero's, have no beginning, middle, or end: their external unity is a pawn to their unity of intention. His discipline is repetitive and his moments of ec- stasy disconnected. Eliot has this one theme in all of his writings and its nature in part explains the excellence of the longer poems and the relative failure of the plays."9 In Lord Weary's Castle Lowell invents a mode of representation that reveals the self-deception of the text's modernist voice, the sort of deception that the contemplative's discipline may unwittingly encour- age. But in this early stage of invention this body of tropes lacks ade- quate verbal means of translating the will and insists on distorting highly conventionalized iconography into psychologically satisfying but almost unrecognizable shapes, such as the figuration of Mary that con- cludes "At the Indian Killer's Grave": let me come Where Mary twists the warlock with her flowers- Her soul a bridal chamber fresh with flowers And her whole body an ecstatic womb, As through the trellis peers the sudden Bridegroom.'0 (Lines 78-82) time, of his contemporaneity" (p. 49). Extrapolating from this, one might define post- modernism as the loss of the presence of the past and a sense of place in time com- bined with a heightened sense of contemporaneity, though some, differing with Eliot, have defined modernism itself in much the same way. 8. A peculiar expression of Lowell's later, more plainly secular view of Eliot's (and perhaps by implication his own) spiritual quest occurs in a consolatory letter Lowell wrote to Valerie Eliot in 1965: "Somehow I think, the long spiritual pilgrimage, that gruelling, heroic, and yet inwardly at peace exploration and purgation-all that shines through Ash Wednesday and the Quartets was inevitably going to end in the surprise reward of ajoyfull marriage" (Southern Review 21 [1987]: 999). 9.

"At the Indian Killer's Grave" delves more deeply into history for its figuration of oppression and slaughter, and more deeply into Catholicism for its figure of redemption. Puritanism here and throughout Lord Weary's Castle dis- places the war as a source of cultural and social tension. Its conflict with Catholicism distorts conventional religious iconographyjust as in the world of these poems its domestic and political doctrines distort the social impact.l2 In much the same way, the war distorts the social compact and warps the religious imagery in Land ofUnlikeness-at the behest of the poet- to emphasize the judgmental rather than the redemptive function of printing of this text. For information on the revisions from the first printing see Maz- zaro, The Achievement of Robert Lowell, 1939-1959. The only poem discussed in this arti- cle that Lowell revised from the first printing is "Where the Rainbow Ends," in which the lines "I saw my city in the Scales, the pans / Of judgment rising and descending. Piles..." originally read "The tree-dabbed suburb where construction mans / The wrath of God. About the chapel, piles...." The first printing of Lord Weary's Castle is almost as difficult to locate as Land of Unlikeness. In the absence of a definitive or vari- orum edition of Lowell's work it seems best to use the most familiar texts, those on which most discussion of Lowell's work is based. 11. The bulk of "At the Indian Killer's Grave," however, does not derive from "Cister- cians in Germany" but from "The Park Street Cemetery," the first poem in Land of Un- likeness. In revising and expanding the poem, Lowell switched graveyards from the one now known as the Old Granary Burial Ground to King's Chapel Burial Ground, which is pierced with the stone-walled mouth of a subway ventilator through which the noise of Green Line trains rises ("A green train grinds along its buried tracks / And screeches"). Stephen Yenser offers a brief but suggestive discussion of the revision of "The Park Street Cemetery" and its role as the opening poem in Land of Unlikeness. See his Circle on Circle: The Poetry of Robert Lowell (Berkeley, 1975), p. 34. 12. Much later in his life, no longer professing Catholicism, Lowell commented to Ian Hamilton on the religious conflicts in his early works: "I was born a non-believing Protes- tant New Englander; my parents and everyone I saw were non-believing Protestant New Englanders. They went to church, but faith was improper. In college, I began reading Hawthorne, Jonathan Edwards, English seventeenth-century preachers, Calvin himself, Gilson and others, some of them Catholics-Catholics and Calvinists I don't think oppo- sites; they are rather alike compared to us in our sublunary, secular sprawl. From zealous, atheist Calvinist to a believing Catholic is no great leap. I overhammered the debating points. Yet Calvinism is ill-conceived, an abstract expressionist church of Rome" ("A Con- versation with Robert Lowell," in Robert Lowell: Interviews and Memoirs, ed. Jeffrey Meyers [Ann Arbor, Mich., 1988], p. 162). Clearly the Robert Lowell of 1971 has distanced himself from his more youthful and obviously conflicted persona, but the description of the "zeal- ous, atheist Calvinist" echoes the critical attitude of the early poetry. 356</page><page sequence="6">William E. Doreski o The Sudden Bridegroom Catholic theology. Judgment remains a motivating force in Lord Weary's Castle but, even when socially directed, it also indicates aesthetic fail- ures and, paradoxically, the inadequacy of religion itself. The gro- tesque iconography at the end of "At the Indian Killer's Grave" points in three directions: toward the aesthetic inadequacy and stubborn persistence of faith, toward the psychological inadequacy of the mod- ernist aesthetic inherited from Eliot and Tate that issues in this kind of compressed imagery, and toward the post-Freudian recognition of sexuality as the open secret of the unrepentant id.13 The will cannot quite overcome the modernist voice, but it can critique it by forcing it to speak in terms it cannot adequately represent. Adequate represen- tation would require a different cultural context, however, one that would finally reject the tradition rather than attempt to revise it. Low- ell's own poetics verge upon this rejection; this Freudian critique of Mary as a culmination of the pagan tradition of vegetation goddesses reveals the sexual anxiety that would dominate much of Lowell's later work, especially The Dolphin. In "At the Indian Killer's Grave," however, the imagery of faith resists being subsumed entirely into sexual domes- ticity. The tension between puritan and Catholic imagery, between the Catholic embrace of Mary's virginity and her florally enfigured fecun- dity, keeps the poem focused on the social hypocrisy of the puritan spiritual legacy rather than allowing it to drift into the personal. Mary's presence represents a richness and generosity of spirit that the puritans rejected in favor of a stark death-oriented culture where her warlock-destroying powers would be honored rather than her inno- cence and purity. At this stage in the development of Lowell's poetics, his will, lack- ing adequate means of representation, seizes upon its own inade- quacy of voice and generates from religious iconography a series of uneasy figurations of pathos. But however troubled and incomplete, 13. Typical of critics who take Lowell's professed Catholicism at face value, Irvin Ehrenpreis in "The Age of Lowell," in Robert Lowell: A Portrait of the Artist in His Time, ed. Michael London and Robert Boyers (New York, 1970), overlooks the vulgar sexuality and the psychological tensions of this passage. He argues that Lowell invokes "John, Matthew, Mark and Luke ... to guide him towards the inclusive faith of the Roman Catholic church, to a vision of salvation that more than admits the Indian chief; for it promises Philip that the blessed Virgin herself will deck out his head with flowers" (p. 167). Yenser in Circle on Circle sees this imagery as "compressing suggestions of re- birth, spiritual marriage, and Armageddon" (p. 58). Like Ehrenpreis, Yenser neglects the crude materiality of the imagery, which undermines Lowell's attempt at a traditional religious construct. Vereen Bell in Robert Lowell: Nihilist as Hero (Cambridge, Mass., 1983) calls this passage a "naively pictorial spectacle" that "evokes the chaste, childlike spirit of the devotional iconography of the Middle Ages" (p. 27). This misrepresents both Lowell and the Middle Ages. 357</page><page sequence="7">MODERN PHILOLOGY this development represents Lowell's revisionary reading of Eliot as a poet who contrived a modernist poetics only to spend a lifetime repu- diating the modern ethos he helped create. That ethos was surely problematic to Eliot and Tate, both of whom made explicit their re- pugnance toward certain aspects of modern culture.14 Regardless of how he saw himself in relation to the tradition represented by Eliot, Lowell had ample precedent for seeing the modernist project as one of escaping from the state of being modern. Because this is a para- doxical project, Lowell's reformulation of it would also have to be paradoxical. Lord Weary's Castle, its aesthetic shaped by modernism, its psy- chological desires producing conflicted forces that undermine the modernist view of tradition, attempts to superimpose the pathos of self-awareness onto the ethos of modernism. The means are a rhet- oric dominated by a clash of competing languages: one determinedly secular, urban, and sexual, another committed to literary tradition, and another psychologically drawn from but not theologically com- mitted to Catholicism. The net result is that concealments of the will, its figures of pathos, shape some of the most powerful moments of poems like "Christmas in Black Rock" and "Where the Rainbow Ends." In aiming to transcend modernist poetics and critique the modern state, Lord Weary's Castle undertakes to persuade the reader that Mary, the eternal virgin at the heart of a dying European cul- ture, can function as the muse of the violence that would topple the modern state. Despite her virgin innocence, Mary can wield force when necessary, and in poems like "On the Eve of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception: 1942" in Land of Unlikeness the poet quite openly requests that she, like Athena, intervene in an unjust war. In Lord Weary's Castle Mary and Jesus, who explicitly threatens to return with a sword, occupy less insistent roles, but their presence remains 14. As evinced, e.g., by T. S. Eliot's After Strange Gods: A Primer of Modern Heresy (New York, 1934), in which a regressive social definition of tradition displaces the sober liter- ary definition propounded in "Tradition and the Individual Talent." In After Strange Gods Eliot suggests a xenophobic view of traditional community: "What I mean by tradition involves all those habitual actions, habits, and customs, from the most significant reli- gious rite to our conventional way of greeting a stranger, which represent the blood kin- ship of 'the same people living in the same place' " (p. 18). Allen Tate, in essays published in the same decade (collected in Reactionary Essays on Poetry and Ideas [New York, 1936]) propounds a new agrarianism that is equally socially conservative and tinged with rac- ism. Lowell in the 1940s sometimes expressed equally conservative social views, but later in life, contrary to the conventional view of political maturation, became much more liberal and progressive. The tension between progressive and reactionary social views is already present in Lord Weary's Castle. 358</page><page sequence="8">William E. Doreski o The Sudden Bridegroom associated with violence, most obviously in poems like "The Dead in Europe." While in Land of Unlikeness such poems as "The Wood of Life" and "Satan's Confession" use parable as a structural device, in Lord Weary's Castle Lowell abandons this structural use of religious motifs without voiding their emotional imperative, anchoring his work more firmly in the present-day urbanized world. He attempts to will Boston into a place of symbolic desire, but since the poems trust no body of figura- tion and even Catholic symbols become wrenched self-parodies, the embrace of modernism serves mostly to reveal the poet's own fear of the modern and his will to escape it. In revising "Christmas Eve in the Time of War" into "Christmas Eve under Hooker's Statue," Lowell sec- ularized the poem by removing much of the religious imagery of the original version.15 In the new version the central trope, taken over from the modernist revision of the English poetic tradition, is the statue-the representative public work of art-which links art, soci- ety, and history. Here, however, General Joseph Hooker, the unsuc- cessful commander of Union forces at Chancellorsville, figures a loss of innocence that bridges the gap between history and the individual. As a descendant of the New England puritan tradition Hooker em- bodies the moral and social hypocrisy that has "blackened" the "state- house," since his god is Mars, not Christ the redeemer. As twenty years ago the child "hung [his] stocking on the tree, and hell's / Serpent entwined the apple in the toe / To sting the child with knowledge," so Hooker's statue exudes the hellish knowledge that transforms boys (" 'All wars are boyish,' Herman Melville said") into ironic, self-aware, and guilty men.16 Christmas Eve should foster commemoration of the origin of true religion, but Lowell's poem confounds the birth of Christ with the American republic's loss of innocence as represented by a rusting and ineffectual "cannon and a cairn of cannon balls" and 15. The original title of the poem, under which it appeared in the Partisan Review in 1943, was "The Capitalist's Meditation by the Civil War Monument." The full title in Land of Unlikeness is "Christmas Eve in the Time of War" followed by (in italics in the original) "A Capitalist Meditates by a Civil War Monument." Lowell revised the poem and published it in Commonweal in 1946 under the title "Christmas Eve under Hooker's Statue," this version identical to the Lord Weary 's Castle version. 16. Melville's lines, from "The March into Virginia," read: All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys, The champions and enthusiasts of the state.

The modernist impulse of "Christmas Eve under Hooker's Statue" is to critique the history of the matured republic in terms of the high idealism of Christianity (primarily Catholicism), but the sense of per- sonal loss that makes the speaker ironic and skeptical overcomes the childlike requirements of faith and necessitates further revision of the Christian outlook. "We are old," he says, and will remain so "Till Christ again turn wanderer and child." Imitation of Christ requires a return to a childhood that the speaker finds personally improbable, so he looks to the Second Coming as a source of renewal, since it would bring into focus a new manifestation of Christ. The whole thrust of the poem, however, collapses the imagery of faith into naive innocence. A winter-dominated poem of age, collective guilt, and frustrated faith ("I ask for bread, my father gives me mould"), "Christmas Eve under Hooker's Statue" inscribes in its very title one aspect of the modernist dilemma-the relationships among competing bodies of iconography, none of which mean any longer what they were once thought to mean, and which now signify only in terms of an immediate context. The personal element of this poem, the memory of a bland and sec- ularized Protestant Christmas with its childhood innocence poisoned by adult understanding, outfaces the public element. The latter would ex- tend this compromise of innocence by confronting Christian idealism with the politics of expediency that led to the Civil War and perhaps to the Second World War. In place of the conventional narrative of sal- vation through the sacrifice of Christ the poem substitutes a personal narrative of knowledge, untouched by redemption except in its postula- tion of an improbable new version of Christian idealism, one in which Christ reverts to his own childhood, a more human state of unrealized possibility. The dialogics of this poem, then, involve a modernist (and traditionally empowered) confrontation of the iconographies of war and of religion by a personal narrative in which iconography no longer functions as a body of symbols but rather as a source of contextually empowered emblems. The "blackout" of this Christmas Eve is both an event of modern warfare and a blotting out of inherited meanings. Whereas in The Waste Land Eliot transplants traditional symbols with in- herited meanings into a dissociative context that preserves strong traces of the narrative that originally empowered them, Lowell places the symbols of this poem in a personal narrative that simply if regretfully negates them by illustrating how inadequately they function outside of their original narratives. In the second stanza the voice of the poet, only half-disguised in biblical paraphrase, neatly undercuts the accu- mulated power of faith, myth, and history by invoking the psychological 360</page><page sequence="10">William E. Doreski o The Sudden Bridegroom anxiety of a speaker for whom the dialogue among symbols no longer provides intellectual sustenance: Now storm-clouds shelter Christmas, once again Mars meets his fruitless star with open arms, His heavy saber flashes with the rime, The war-god's bronzed and empty forehead forms Anonymous machinery from raw men; The cannon on the Common cannot stun The blundering butcher as he rides on Time- The barrel clinks with holly. I am cold: I ask for bread, my father gives me mould.... Not only the speaking voice but almost every modifier in the poem undercuts the symbols' traditional efficacy. "Fruitless," "empty," "anony- mous," and "blundering" attest the failure of meaning and the collapse, not merely the modification or reassessment, of traditions. By under- mining the poem's entire symbolic structure, the skepticism of the speaking voice, though rooted in biblical struggles between faith and doubt, effectuates a break with modernist faith in language. The tones of this insinuated private voice, colored by distrust of the tradition it invokes, distinguished Lowell's work from that of many of his contemporaries long before he fully accepted the voice and began to write openly autobiographical poems. By contrast the characteristic voice of high modernism in American, British, and a great deal of French poetry is discrete, distant: archetypal and ceremonial rather than personal, "a kind of incantation," as Mallarme describes it.17 It purports to be a voice of objectivity and impersonality, though recent critical thinking has cast doubt upon its actual distance from personal concerns. Certainly it places great faith in the incantatory power of lan- guage, sometimes even confounding representation with presence-a heresy in our postmodern linguistic world. Eliot, Pound, Stevens, and Yeats generate almost infinite possibilities with this voice. Overawed by their achievement, the subsequent generation would only gradually return to the more personal lyric voice categorically rejected by Pound and Eliot. They associated that voice with the nineteenth century, par- ticularly with Wordsworth, for whom their admiration was decidedly qualified, and with Tennyson, whom Eliot in the 1936 essay "In Memo- riam" had just begun to rehabilitate after years of begrudging him an honored place in the tradition.18 17.

Although by then many poets, notably Weldon Kees, W. D. Snodgrass, Frank O'Hara, and Alien Ginsberg, had adopted radically personal poetics, in 1946 those of Lowell's contemporaries who were challenging the inherited modern- ist positions mostly had not confronted the doctrines and voice of objectivity and impersonality with aesthetic and psychological imper- atives that could serve as convincing alternatives. During the 1940s perhaps only Delmore Schwartz (Genesis, 1943), Muriel Rukeyser (Beast in View, 1944), Elizabeth Bishop (North and South, 1946), and Theodore Roethke (The Lost Son, 1948) challenged the characteristic modernist voice as productively as Lowell did.'9 Some of the most progressive and interesting poets of the era, including George Oppen, Charles Reznikoff, Louis Zukofsky, and Carl Rakosi, chose instead to emphasize or even exaggerate the objective voice, building upon the precisely de- scriptive aspect of William Carlos Williams's work while rejecting (for the moment) his example of a frankly personal voice.20 Eventually, how- ever, Williams, almost alone in his generation, would provide a strong 19. Some would add Kenneth Rexroth to this list, but I do not believe that his poetry of the 1940s deals with the complexities and challenges of modernism. Rather, it seems to take them for granted, and speaks in a voice that, while of great clarity and often conspicuous beauty (as in much of The Phoenix and the Tortoise), lacks the self-conscious- ness and reflexivity that engender the difficulties and rewards of Lowell's, Schwartz's, and Rukeyser's poetry. While such early poems of Rexroth's as "A Prolegomenon to a Theodicy" (1927) are superficially modern in manner, I am not convinced that by temperament and sensibility he was a modernist, a postmodernist, or a critic of either mode. Rather, and perhaps to his credit, he seems to have stood aside from that prob- lematical dynamic, and this made possible such calm and expansive poems as The Heart's Garden, The Garden's Heart (1967). 20. The Objectivists cannot be considered merely ephebes of the high modernists Pound and Williams. In some cases their more liberal or even radical political views separated them from the older poets, and in all cases their aesthetic concerns are too complex and individual to allow us to regard their objectivity as the only or even the main feature of their work. They did not, for the most part, see themselves as a school. As Rexroth notes, "Almost all the people that Zukofsky picked as Objectivists didn't agree with him" (American Poetry in the Twentieth Century [New York, 1973], p. 111). They did tend to favor an aloof and impersonal voice, however, though rarely one as ceremo- nial as Yeats's. Their preoccupation with formal problems sharply distinguishes them from Lowell, who, having temporarily abandoned free verse in the 1940s, favored con- ventional metrical structures and regularized end-rhyme schemes. Lowell was con- cerned with form, but as he noted in 1960, looking back on this period, "We believed in form, that was very important" (unpublished transcript, Houghton Library). The Ob- jectivists did not believe in form; that is, they did not take for granted its necessity or utility, but insisted on reinventing or rediscovering it with every poem. Their skepti- cism about form parallels Lowell's skepticism about language and prompts a different but comparable experimentation. 362</page><page sequence="12">William E. Doreski o The Sudden Bridegroom model for the rediscovery or reinvention of the lyric "I-you" voice of intimacy and personal discovery.21 Lowell himself rediscovered Wil- liams in the early 1950s: his undergraduate notebooks show him ex- perimenting with Williams-like free verse.22 Although Williams would inspire him with a new sense of the possibilities of a more casually intimate voice one less strained and self-conscious than that of "Christmas Eve under Hooker's Statue"-some of Lowell's poems of the war years were already clearly drifting in that direction. "The Drunken Fisherman," virtually unrevised (except for one line) from its appearance in Land of Unlikeness, goes a step further than "Christmas Eve under Hooker's Statue" in reinventing this personal lyric voice. The speaker is an adult Huckleberry Finn who toys with the archetypal imagery of his avocation, rejecting the idea that one fishes for symbols ("Truly Jehovah's bow suspends / No pots of gold to weight its ends") and arguing that only real fish-"the blood-mouthed rainbow trout"-are his prey. After establishing his credentials as an actual fisherman complete with "A whiskey bottle full of worms," how- ever, he toys with archetypes of his occupation-the savior and the blasphemer, Christ and Melville's Ahab-and acknowledges that there is no way "to cast [his] hook / Out of this dynamited brook," no way to entirely resist the pressures of significance. To distance himself from these archetypal roles which require transcendent faith, the speaker distorts them almost beyond recognition, relegating the Ahab-role to the "pot-hole of old age" and asserting that he "will catch Christ with a greased worm" to enact his role as the ironic figure of the "Man- Fisher": not only Christ as fisher of men, but the speaker as fisher of Christ. This recognition of the role-reversal implicit in metaphor sug- gests how deeply compromised is the conventional imagery of the fisherman. The symbol no longer retains its shape. The fisherman is both the savior and the destroyer, the hunter and the prey. Here the 21. Auden had of course already gone much farther than Lowell-or Williams, for that matter-in developing alternative voices for contemporary poetry, but though Jar- rell and other American poets admired him, his example had not and has not yet been fully absorbed. 22. Nine notebooks at Houghton Library, Harvard, filed as "Land of Unlikeness Note- books," contain school notes and miscellaneous material but largely consist of poems written from Lowell's years at St. Mark's through his undergraduate years at Kenyon to the early 1940s. Most of the poems in Land of Unlikeness appear in these notebooks in rough draft versions. The earliest poems are divided between rhymed and roughly metered for- mal poems and informal free verse poems. Many are religious in topic, while many others are humorous. For examples of this early verse, see William Doreski, The Years of Our Friendship: Robert Lowell and Allen Tate (Jackson, Miss., 1990), pp. 31-35, 43- 45.

By stalking the speaker's "blood- stream" he is deconstructing the relationship between tenor and vehi- cle, undoing the knots of metaphor to expose the arbitrary character of reference. The speaker's casual blasphemy (as opposed to Ahab's calculated blasphemy) and the mock-drunken jauntiness of his voice make available this casual attitude toward metaphor. Whereas in "Christmas Eve under Hooker's Statue" the poet's first- person voice carries notes of regret and nostalgia for the compromised iconography of religion and history, the voice of "The Drunken Fish- erman" revels in acknowledging the arbitrary nature of language and metaphor: Once fishing was a rabbit's foot- O wind blow cold, O wind blow hot, Let suns stay in or suns step out: Life danced ajig on the sperm-whale's spout- The fisher's fluent and obscene Catches kept his conscience clean. Children, the raging memory drools Over the glory of past pools. That these "past pools" are now fished out does not bother the drunken fisherman; he accepts the absurdity of his enterprise and embraces the chaotic declension of metaphor that he has precipitated. The poem moves dialogically between his acknowledgment of the traditional fisher-metaphors (savior, destroyer of nature, the fisher-king) and his drink-loosened sensibility, which playfully exploits the failure of these metaphors to retain their grip on traditional significance. When Eliot in The Waste Land invokes the fisher-king as a metaphor of the individ- ual's dilemma in a decaying, corrupt culture, he leans on the figure's long history, updating rather than refusing its literary and historical resonance. But Lowell in "The Drunken Fisherman" undermines tra- ditional metaphors by manipulating the early Christian symbol of the fish, baiting his hook with a "greased worm" to catch the fisher of men as if Christ were himself an ordinary fish like the "blood-mouthed trout" in his creel. That the roles of fisher and fish should be so easily reversed illus- trates how arbitrary metaphor is, how inadequately language engages such mysteries as salvation and blasphemy. This sense of the inade- quacies of language, while hardly unique to the twentieth century, characterizes much contemporary poetry not only as attitude but as topic. Occurring in Lowell's work as a flash of awareness, this sense usually results from self-consciousness-a moment when not only the absurdity of language but the awkwardness of the poet-speaker be- 364</page><page sequence="14">William E. Doreski o The Sudden Bridegroom comes palpable-and it is usually rather quickly glossed over by a shift to a more public voice. This dialectic of private and public voices char- acterizes some of Lowell's finished later poems, such as "For the Union Dead" and "Waking Early Sunday Morning." "After the Surprising Con- versions," a dramatic monologue cast in the voice of Jonathan Edwards, seems safely to historicize this dialectic but nonetheless exposes the tension between Lowell's modernist and nihilist sensibilities. As Low- ell himself points out, this poem reworks a passage from Edwards's A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God in the Conversion of Many Hundred Souls in Northampton, and the Neighboring Towns and Villages (1737).23 The poem opens in epistolary form by imitating Edwards's characteristically formal diction: September twenty-second, Sir: today I answer. In the latter part of May, Hard on our Lord's Ascension, it began To be more sensible. It concludes with a cluster of images whose more naturalistic tenor (including a nonitalicized repetition of the date) offsets and some- what neutralizes and secularizes the rehearsal of spiritual woes that constitutes the bulk of the poem: September twenty-second, Sir, the bough Cracks with the unpicked apples, and at dawn The small-mouth bass breaks water, gorged with spawn. Edwards's original letter-from which the finished Narrative, with some additions, derives- addresses Benjamin Coleman, minister of the Brattle Street Church in Boston, who had written for information about the religious revival. The letter, dated May 30, 1735, has a post- script describing the suicide of Josiah Hawley, Edwards's uncle and one of the most prominent citizens of Northampton. In writing his 23. Lowell does not actually name the source, but in the note at the front of Lord Weary 's Castle he says, "I hope that the source of 'After the Surprising Conversions' will be recognized" (p. vii). Lowell had at one time planned to write a biography of Jonathan Edwards, who was his somewhat remote ancestor. In 1942- 43, while staying with the Tates in Tennessee, he "was heaping up books on Jonathan Edwards and taking notes and getting more and more numb on the subject, looking at old leather-bound volumes on freedom of the will and so on, and feeling less and less a calling" (Frederick Seidel, "The Art of Poetry: Robert Lowell," in Meyers, ed. [n. 12 above], p. 52). During the same winter he completed sixteen of the poems that would go into Land of Unlikeness (see Ian Hamilton, Robert Lowell: A Biography [New York, 1982], p. 82). At some point Lowell trav- eled to Northampton to inspect whatever Edwards relics he could find. He describes this "pilgrimage" in "Jonathan Edwards in Western Massachusetts" in For the Union Dead (New York, 1964), pp. 40-44. The most immediate products were the poem under discussion here and "Mr. Edwards and the Spider." 365</page><page sequence="15">MODERN PHILOLOGY poem Lowell redates the original account and sets it in the fall (though accurately placing Hawley's suicide in May) presumably so that he can conclude with autumnal imagery of ripeness and mature fecundity.24 As though waking from a bad dream, Edwards acknowl- edges that in stark contrast with the suicide of Hawley, a "gentleman / Of more than common understanding," the natural world of apples and small-mouth bass seems a place of unfallen innocence or, better still, perhaps a place in which the terms of sin and redemption no longer apply.25 By contrast Hawley, whose name the poem withholds (as does the relevant passage in the published Narrative), worried over his Bible late at night in his attic, and the poem suggests that he shut himself into a world of language where phenomenal existence seemed a religious or epistemological construction rather than material reality. In his spiritual malaise if not in his drastic response he represents his misguided brethren. The spirit of God seems to have turned against Northampton and revoked the communal sense of purpose: Content was gone. All the good work was quashed. We were undone. The breath of God had carried out a planned And sensible withdrawal from this land.... 24. The most significant addition to Edwards's tale is Lowell's closure. Edwards ends the sad story by noting that "some pious persons . . . had it urged upon 'em, as if some- body had spoken to 'em, Cut your own Throat, now is a good Opportunity. Now; Now!" Low- ell's added closing lines do a great deal to dissipate the gloom and general tenor of Edwards's tale of spiritual tragedy. Jerome Mazzaro argues that Lowell dated the poem September 22 because "it is the feast day of St. Thomas of Villanova, who sent the first Augustinians to the Americas as missionaries, and like Edwards' sermons, those of St. Thomas 'were followed by a wonderful change in the lives of men in all places he visited' " (The Poetic Themes of Robert Lowell [Ann Arbor, Mich., 1965], p. 70). This seems to explain the specific date, but redating the letter to the fall points to the larger strat- egy of secularizing the poem's motif of salvation.

Tracy, Jonathan Edwards, Pastor: Religion and Society in Eighteenth-Century Northampton (New York, 1980), pp. 109-18; Giovanni Gio- vannini's discussion of the source in "Lowell's 'After the Surprising Conversions' " (The Explicator 9 [June 1951]: 53); Mazzaro's quotation of the relevant passage from Ed- wards's Narrative with comparable lines of the poem indicated parenthetically (The Poetic Themes of Robert Lowell, pp. 69-70); and Marjorie Perloff's discussion of Lowell's revamping of Edwards's syntax (The Poetic Art of Robert Lowell [Ithaca, N.Y, 1973], pp. 120-23). 25. In one of the most fruitful discussions of this poem, Bruce Michelson in "Randall Jarrell and Robert Lowell: The Making of Lord Weary's Castle," in Bloom, ed., notes of Lowell's closure that "it saves him from one of those blind alleys of certainty that could make his voice intolerable, and further poetry in a sense impossible" (p. 149). 366</page><page sequence="16">William E. Doreski o The Sudden Bridegroom Unlike Edwards's original narrative which prescribes the cold solace of a day of fasting after Hawley's suicide, the poem offers a secular and material palliative. To resist the impulse to "Cut your own throat. Now! Now!" one must turn from the world of metaphor to the phe- nomenal world of apples and bass, from the world of tradition to the world of immediate observation and experience. This is the very di- rection that Lowell's poems would take in the following decades. Like the voice of Lowell's Edwards doubting the efficacy of his former theological views and considering how the contemporary situation modifies his position, modernist tropes require a skepticism in medi- ating tradition. This voice, drifting toward atheism, acknowledges that the breath of God might well be withdrawn to leave the chosen people at a loss. Tropes of self-awareness require unmediated imagery, refusing irony and skepticism because they have already rejected whatever there was to be ironic or skeptical about. Thus the voice of Lowell's Edwards must turn for its images to the cultural or natural world at hand rather than to the heavily mediated world of biblical mythology. By closing his letter as he does, Edwards gains in peace of mind whatever he loses in resonance. The self-aware, self-conscious contemporary world finally proceeds to final refusal of medieval, Elizabethan, and Victo- rian worldviews. The new tropes of self-representation acknowledge that the old constructs of the gods no longer function, no longer even resonate. Resonance still occurs, however, when the personal voice in- sists that experience and not history or tradition bears authority. The initial voice of "Where the Rainbow Ends" is that of a Christian vision- ary who witnesses to the imminence of apocalypse in Boston. Jerome Mazzaro notes that this "vision parallels St. John's in Apocalypse 21:2 'And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.' " He then aptly remarks that, "as the reader soon learns, Boston exists outside of the rainbow of God's will."26 Although Hugh Staples has characterized it as "metaphysical,"27 Lowell's poem offers a thoroughly modernist application of this apocalyptic imagery-modernist in Eliot's manner because traditional to the core. Yet the immediacy of witness deter- mines the pivotal image of the poem, the "Pepperpot, ironic rainbow, [that] spans / Charles River and its scales of scorched-earth miles." The 26. Mazzaro, The Poetic Themes of Robert Lowell, p. 54. "Where the Rainbow Ends" did not appear in Land of Unlikeness (it was published in The Nation in 1946). Lowell revised it slightly, however, between the first and second printings of Lord Weary's Castle. 27. Staples (n. 2 above), p. 107. 367</page><page sequence="17">MODERN PHILOLOGY authenticity of the speaker's vision does not inhere in the authority with which he deploys the trope of biblical revelation with its archetypal im- ages of serpents, doves, and "scythers, Time and Death" but, rather, in the trope of geographical presence generated by invoking-in the middle of a poem full of visionary images-the Longfellow Bridge, an utterly ordinary sight to all Bostonians.28 This graceless bridge, braced with green steel girders readily visible beneath its arches, carries a rapid transit line as well as four lanes of automotive traffic. How else could we be sure that the referent of this apocalyptic vision is Boston, except by the speaker's invocation of the most utilitarian and prosaic of landmarks? The distrust of visionary imagery, the unwillingness to allow it to bear the full weight of the poem, derives from those passages in The Waste Land that suggest the domesticated gray London of Eliot's bank- clerk career and hint at buried autobiographical impulses. Lowell's poem, also haunted by unspoken, self-revelatory desires, relies more heavily on the actual Longfellow Bridge than he may have intended. By comparison the other images of the poem seem somewhat distant and unauthentic, as if the speaker were dissatisfied with allegorical figures like Time and Death wielded with little modernist irony, and halfway through his poem realized how unsatisfactory a basis for a poem is a religious vision unmediated by actuality.29 This half-articulated note of anxiety exposes the psychological inadequacy of religious im- agery in modernist poetry, an inadequacy that to a great extent shapes Eliot's Four Quartets. When Lowell called Eliot's masterpiece "a quasi- autobiographical testimony of the experience of union with God, or rather, its imperfect approximation in this life" he revealed his view of the role of religious poetry at the time he was writing Lord Weary's Cas- tle.30 The imperfection noted by Lowell is not only aesthetic but the- matic as well; it reflects the structural imperfections that culture and society oppose to the subjective literary ideal of romanticism and modernism. As Lowell would acknowledge in later years, language is public and belongs to culture and society rather than to the isolated romantic imagination: Those blessed structures, plot and rhyme- why are they no help to me now 28. Phillip Cooper in The Autobiographical Myth of Robert Lowell (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1970) accurately if somewhat glibly characterizes the Pepperpot at the end of the rain- bow as the place "where the sublime encounters the ridiculous" (p. 85). 29. Yet even Harold Bloom, a decidedly skeptical critic, in his introduction mistakes the opening stanza of this poem as "an instance of. . . the poetry of belief" (p. 4). 30. Lowell, Collected Prose (n. 9 above), p. 45. 368</page><page sequence="18">William E. Doreski o The Sudden Bridegroom I want to make something imagined, not recalled?3' By 1977, when this poem was published, Lowell's formal skills could no longer effectively mediate between the social world of experience and the private, lost world of the subject.32 But the poems of the 1940s have not yet fully surrendered to the loss of romantic and reli- gious solipsism. If for Lowell, as for Eliot, in "wrestling with language, artistic craft is analogous to contemplative discipline," then "Where the Rainbow Ends" wrestles with the aesthetic attraction of the imme- diate phenomenal world as opposed to the visionary world of reli- gious symbols as though the match were between the self's surrender and its realization.33 Only in the larger context of Lord Weary's Castle and Lowell's later development does this clearly emerge as a wrestling match between modernist tropes derived from conventional religious iconography and tropes of unmediated experience. Lowell's poetics, informed by skeptical modernism but compro- mised by social and aesthetic disillusionment, could not sustain un- mediated religious experience, largely because the language of such experience no longer corresponded to his experiential and aesthetic world. This is one reason he drifted away from Catholicism and reli- gious poetry in general. The new mode of linguistic self-awareness, still more radical, displaces skepticism with a weary knowledge: God is not dead, he simply never existed except as a language-construct, and the visionary is the prisoner of his own experience. The trope of vulnerability, identified by Bloom as Lowell's primary contribution to poetry, derives from the knowledge that inhabitants of a world de- prived of religion are more vulnerable to personal and societal expe- rience than had been realized, and this deprivation appears to the poet Lowell as primarily a failure of language. Its thematics underlie "Mother Marie Therese" and "Falling Asleep over the Aeneid," and they also undermine much of the religious iconography of Lord Weary's Cas- tle to expose the psychosexual or egoistical longings beneath the reli- gious impulse, as in the conclusion of "At the Indian Killer's Grave." 31. Robert Lowell, "Epilogue," in Day by Day (n. 3 above), p. 127. 32. This failure of mediation may signal the achievement of Lowell's mature post- modern style, one that accords with Fredric Jameson's observation in Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (Durham, N.C., 1991) that "perhaps the supreme formal feature of all the postmodernists" is "a new kind of flatness or depthlessness, a new kind of superficiality in the almost literal sense" (p. 9). Certainly some reviewers of Day by Day found it disarmingly-or forbiddingly-flat and lacking in depth. Lowell's utter effacement of style-a truly postmodern style-and his final dropping of the mask seem to me the consequences of the process described in this article. 33. Lowell, Collected Prose, p. 45. 369</page><page sequence="19">MODERN PHILOLOGY This passage, as openly sexual as "Leda and the Swan," is decidedly heretical in the speaker's desire to "come / Where Mary twists the war- lock with her flowers," especially since her "whole body" is an "ecstatic womb," attuned to pleasures that are simultaneously religious and libidinous.34 Surely Lowell knew what he was writing here, and why. Far from being committed to a conventional religiosity, he was determined to expose the awkward writhings and even the failings of language in portraying ecstatic or visionary states. But in doing so he also exposed what would become the central issue of a contemporary dilemma: the recognition that the arbitrariness of language exposes the arbi- trariness of culture itself. The trope of Mary's sexuality is also the trope of the failure of language to mediate between itself and what- ever is outside of or beyond language. Jarrell thought that Lowell's mind was exclusively "traditional, theocentric, and anthropomorphic," failing to see that the wrenching of imagery that characterizes these poems is caused by tension between a modernist language of skepti- cism and a weary dismissal of the traditional worldview represented both by Catholicism and the high modernism of Eliot.35 But Jarrell saw modernism and tradition as opposites or incompatibles. From the vantage of our era this no longer seems entirely true-in fact, it did not seem true for Eliot, who never repudiated his positioning of the modern poet in a line of succession in "Tradition and the Individual Talent." Jarrell was deeply indebted to the categorically American worldview of Whitman, however, and was already leaning toward a poetics of self-consciousness both in his own verse and in his expecta- tions as a reviewer; consequently he correctly identifies the world of Lord Weary 's Castle as one of struggle between the "Old Law" and a new "accessibility to experience."36 From a perspective of nearly fifty additional years we can better understand how deeply implicated larger issues of language and culture are in this struggle, and how de- cisively the tropes of personal experience would come to displace, in both poetry and the larger culture, the received tropes of religion and literary tradition-including perhaps especially their high mod- ernist revisionary modes. 34. That the familiar colloquialism for sexual orgasm was current in Lowell's circle is made clear by this November 1, 1945, entry in Delmore Schwartz's journal: "Jean [Stafford Lowell] to Cal [Lowell]: May I tell Delmore?
