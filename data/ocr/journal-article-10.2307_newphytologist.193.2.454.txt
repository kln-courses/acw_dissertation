The spatial distribution patterns of most pure species and hybrids were independent from each other, except that ofO. purpurea and its hybrids. The fungal community composition of established individuals Key words: hybridization, mycorrhizal fungi, Orchidaceae, seed germination, spatial point differed significantly between pure species, but not between hybrids and O. purpurea. Seed pattern analysis. germination experiments using pure seeds showed that the highest number of protocorms were found in regions where adult individuals were most abundant. In the case of hybrid seeds, germination was restricted to areas where the mother plant was most abundant. • Overall, these results suggest that the observed nonrandom spatial distribution of both pure and hybrid plants is dependent on the contingencies of the spatial distribution of suitable mycorrhizal fungi. it affects spatial patterns of recruitment and establishment of Introduction orchids (Otero &amp; Flanagan, 2006).

To detect and identify mycorrhizal fungi, the same procedures were followed as in Jacquemyn et al. (2011a,b).
