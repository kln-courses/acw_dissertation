<plain_text><page sequence="1">Personal adornments at Moche, north coast of Peru H?l?ne Bernier Archaeohgical research carried out during the last decade in the major urban center of Moche (Moche Valley) permitted the discovery of more than one thousand beads and pendants made of ceramic and non-precious stone. These personal adornments werefound in various domestic contexts, and also in buriab, around the necks of adults and children of both sexes. Excavations abo revealed that ceramic and stone necklace elements were produced by local craft specialists in work shops heated in the urban sector. This article addresses the meanings, uses, andfunctions of beads and pendants found at Moche through a detailed analysis of their consumption patterns and iconography. It is suggested that the production of beads and pendants was supervised by Moche urban leaders and their use was an integral part of the social relations, political motivations, and ritual life of urban dwellers. Las investigaciones realizadas durante U ultima d?cada en el sector urbano del sitio de Moche (en el valle del mismo nombre) permitieron el descubrimiento de m?s de mil cuentas y colgantes de cer?mica y piedra. Estos adornos corporales fueron hallados en diversos contextos dom?sticos, y tambi?n en entierros, alrededor del cuello de adultos e infantes de ambos sexos. Las excavaciones reveforon adem?s que los adornos de piedra y de cer?mica fueron producidos por artesanos especialistas focales en talleres ubicados en el sector urbano. Este articulo explora los significados, usos y funciones de los adornos corporales hallados en Moche a trav?s de un an?lisu detallado de sus patrones de consumo e iconografia. Se sugiere que fo producci?n de cuentas y colgantes era supervisada por los l?deres urbanos Moche y que su uso formaba parte integral tanto de las relaciones sociales y las motivaciones pol?ticas como de fo vida ritual de los ocupantes del sector urbano. In the ancient Andes, social identities, roles, and socio-economic statuses were materialized through garments and personal adornments combining esthetics and complex symbolism. Chim? kings wore elaborate tunics and jewelry decorated with animals and scenes that evoked the sacred origin of kingship (Cordy-Collins 1990). Huari leaders and state representatives dressed in intricately patterned tunics reflecting their rank in the social hierarchy and their lineage affiliation (Bergh 1999: 66-67; Cook 1992). Inca men and women wore clothes and adornments revealing their gender, status, ethnic origin, and occupation (Cobo 1990: 185-189 [1653]; D'Altroy 2002: 294-296; Murra 1962). The Moche society was no exception. Moche art and fu nerary archaeological contexts reveal that many so cial roles and functions were associated with specific H?l?ne Bernier, Professor, Heritage College, 325 Cit? des Jeunes Blvd., Gatineau, Qu?bec J8Y 6T3, Canada, hbernier@ cegep-heritage.qc.ca ?awpa Pacha: Journal of Andean Archaeology, Volume 30, Number 1, pp. 91-114.

Individuals like priests, priestesses, warriors, or messengers were signified by par ticular headdresses and precious ornaments (Alva 1994; Benson 1980; Donnan and Castillo 1994; Donnan and McClelland 1999: 128-133; Uceda2004). While little is known about Moche decorated cloth garments due to poor preservation conditions, archaeological evidence shows that Moche artisans produced a wide range of prestigious personal adorn ments such as headdresses, ear spools, nose ornaments, bead pectorals, and platelet-covered textiles,1 using metals and valuable shells and stones (Alva 1994; Don nan 1978: 73-78). Such valuable adornments were the privilege of the ruling elite and high-ranking individu als in the Moche political and religious hierarchies. This article focuses on a specific category of Moche personal adornments not often considered in the literature, but yet fundamentally related to the ideo logical and political spheres of the Moche society. Dur ing the last decade, excavations at the site of Moche re vealed that urban dwellers wore on a daily basis simple beads and pendants made of ceramic and non-precious stones (Bernier 2005: 161-163, 215-219). Images de picted by figurative necklace elements were recurrent and carefully chosen, and they expressed major themes of the Moche religious iconography. In this article, I analyze the production, use, and figurative imagery of necklace pieces encountered in the Moche urban sec tor, in order to understand their meanings and func tions. I argue that in spite of their simplicity, beads and pendants were strategically used in status building efforts by urban leaders who supervised their produc tion, oversaw their distribution, and deliberately used the religious imagery expressed by figurative elements. Moche Society and the Urban Capital of Moche The Moche polity flourished on the Peruvian coastal desert between the first and the eighth centuries A.D. This complex society setded in valleys irrigated by riv ers flowing westward from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean, in a narrow littoral strip stretching between the Piura Valley and the Huarmey Valley. The Moche pol ity is considered by many to be the first expansionist state to emerge on the Peruvian coast, from the Moche III phase beginning around the fourth century A.D. (Bawden 1996: 227-248; Chapdelaine 2000: 125, 2001: 69, 2002: 81; Moseley 1992: 166; Topic 1977: 366; Wilson 1988: 333). Considered as a center of pri mary importance within the Moche polity, the site of Moche is located six kilometers inland from the Pa cific Ocean, on the south bank of the Moche River. The site is composed of a 60-hectare plain bordered by two monumental platforms: Huaca del Sol to the west and Huaca de la Luna to the east, standing just at the base of a hill named Cerro Blanco. In the plain between the two platforms lies an extensive urban sec tor buried beneath thick layers of sand and sediments, with residential architectural compounds separated by streets and open public areas (Figure 1) (Chapdelaine 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003; Montoya et al. 2000; Van Gijseghem 1997, 2001). The site of Moche was occupied by members of the ruling elite who maintained the authority and the continuity of ritual activities and state institutions. The site was also occupied by a large urban popula tion composed of lineages or corporate groups whose members were characterized by unequal economic sta tus and were endowed with various social roles. The ur ban population was integrated into the Moche political structure at many levels, through trade, ritual, admin istration, non-alimentary production, and large scale architectural and artistic projects (Chapdelaine 2001). The first scientific excavations at Moche were car ried out by Max Uhle in 1899 and 1900. Uhle mapped the site and the monumental platforms, identified cemeteries, workshops, and domestic structures at the surface, and excavated a funerary platform. From the ceramic material recovered in his excavations at Moche, Uhle first identified the Moche as a culture distinct from the Chim? (Kroeber 1925, 1944: 56-57; Uhle 1913). The first large-scale excavations in the Moche urban sector were organized in the 1970s by the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project of Harvard University. These excavations permitted a detailed study of Moche funerary practices (Donnan and Mackey 1978), and also led to a greater understanding of domestic archi tecture (Topic 1977) and subsistence patterns (Pozor 92</page><page sequence="3">Bernier: Personal adornments at Moche, north coast of Peru Figure 1. Excavated area of the Moche urban sector showing architectural compounds mentioned in text. ski 1979). Beginning in 1991, the large-scale Peruvian project Huaca de la Luna (PHLL), directed by San tiago Uceda and Ricardo Morales from the Univer sidad Nacional de Trujillo, furthered considerably the knowledge regarding monumental architecture and ur banism (Uceda 2001; Uceda et al. 1997, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006; Uceda andTufinio 2003). Between 1995 and 2000, the urban sector was the object of a research program involving the Universit? de Montr?al and the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo. This program, called Zona Urbana Moche (ZUM), provided new data about Moche urban and social organization during the apo gee or Moche IV phase (Bernier 2006; Chapdelaine 1997,1998,1999; Chapdelaine et al. 2003; Uceda and Chapdelaine 1998). The data discussed in this article were collected during excavations conducted by the PHLL and ZUM projects in Moche IV archaeological contexts. Data from domestic contexts were collected by the ZUM project between 1995 and 2000. Only or naments collected within extensively excavated archi tectural compounds dating from the Moche IV phase were considered in the study (Compounds # 5, 7, 9, 12, 26, and 37). Data from funerary contexts were collected by the PHLL and ZUM projects between 1995 and 2003. Only unlooted burials dating from the Moche IV phase were considered in the study. 93</page><page sequence="4">?awpa Pacha: Journal of Andean Archaeology Volume 30, Number 1 Table 1.

As indicated in Table 1, most of the beads and pendants uncovered in the urban sector are either carved in a steatite-like local stone or made of fired clay. Clay was the favorite material for the manufacture of most types of simple geometric beads, whereas local stone was privileged for making pendants. Other necklace elements, less numerous, are carved in quartz crystals, turquoise, sodalite, bone, or shell. Beads generally have a geometric shape. They re flect a certain standardization and can be classified in eight morphological types following precise criteria: el liptical, cylindrical, spheroid, disc, tubular, composite, biconical, and rectangular.3 Elliptical beads have a circular section and a con vex, symmetrical profile. Their length is up to three times longer than their diameter (Figure 2A). About two thirds of elliptical beads in our sample are made of fired clay. Disc-shaped beads have a circular section and their diameter is larger than their length. They have flat extremities and their profile is flat or occasionally convex (Figure 2B). Most disc-shaped beads are made of stone. Spheroid beads take the shape of perfect or slighdy flattened spheres (Figure 2C). Most of them are made of fired clay. Cylindrical beads are character ized by a circular section, a flat profile, and flat extremi ties. Their length is higher than their diameter (Figure 2D). Tubular beads have a circular section and a con vex, symmetrical profile. They are similar to elliptical beads but their length is at least three times longer than their diameter. Tubular beads have no definite extremi ties and their profile joins the perforation (Figure 2E). Most are made of fired clay. Diagnostic attributes of rectangular beads are a square or rectangular section and a straight or slightly convex profile. Their length is larger than their diameter (Figure 2F). All rectangu lar beads are made of hard material like stone or bone. Composite beads have a circular section, at least two distinct segments, and their length is longer than their diameter (Figure 2G). Biconical beads are character ized by a circular section and a profile with a corner point. Their length is approximately equivalent to their diameter (Figure 2H). Most biconical beads are made of fired clay. Moche beads are small in size.4 Whereas beads with curved faces are easier to make with clay, stone was the privileged material to make those with large flat surfaces (Table 2). Pendants are slighdy larger necklace elements with one or more perforations located close to an ex tremity. While some pendants have a geometric shape, most show figurative themes (see Table 1). Figurative beads and pendants uncovered at Moche are variable 94</page><page sequence="5">Bernier: Personal adornments at Moche, north coast of Peru . Diameter Length Figure 2.

Despite this vari ability, images are recurrent and clearly inspired from the Moche mythological or symbolic universe illus trated on ritual ceramics. Recurrent images are botani cal, zoomorphic, or anthropomorphic, or they repre sent objects. Various kinds of seeds seem to have been popular images worn on necklaces, as well as small human figures, fish, birds, bags, and globular vessels. Most categories of figurative pendants were made both with clay and stone. However, human or skeletal fig ures, peanuts, and nectandra seeds were always made of fine molded clay (Table 3). It seems that the choice of material used to make figurative necklace pieces was in fluenced by technological reasons, as molded clay was used to produce intricate shapes and detailed surfaces. Simple necklaces were made of one or a few strands. Funerary data from Moche indicate that beads and pendants composing a necklace strand tended to be similar in material and shape. For example, in well preserved burials dating from the Moche III period, individuals wore strands of numerous identical fish, maize grains, beans, or hand-shaped pendants (Chau 95</page><page sequence="6">?awpa Pacha: Journal of Andean Archaeology Volume 30, Number 1 Table 3.

In a looted Moche IV burial discovered on Platform II of Huaca de la Luna, many identical beads in the shape of ulluchu fruits were discovered (Bourget 2006: 34, 38). Archaeological Contexts Domestic use. Geometric and figurative necklace ele ments were found in every domestic architectural com pound excavated at Moche (Bernier 1999a: 41), in every type of room excavated: patios, storage rooms, food pro cessing and cooking areas, corridors, and alleyways. The quantity of beads and pendants found in each domestic compound is related to the number of square meters ex 96</page><page sequence="7">Bernien Personal adornments at Moche, north coast of Peru cavated; more than two hundred necklace elements were uncovered in extensively excavated compounds, such as 9 and 37.5 They were abandoned on habitation floors, inside architectural fill, or in domestic midden depos its (Table 4). The domestic distribution of beads and pendants indicates that they were commonly used and integrated into the daily life of the whole community. Excavations in higher-status architectural compounds (Tello 1998) and modest houses at the periphery of the urban sector (Chapdelaine et al. 2003: 187-191) showed that the same beads and pendants were worn by people of various social ranks. Identical figurative beads and pendants were found in many houses, revealing that urban dwellers most likely did not use them as symbols of family or lineage membership. It is worth noting that many factors can bias the original distribution and archaeological recovery of beads and pendants, which were not necessarily found in great quantities where they were commonly used. During the Moche occupation, rooms like storage bins were rarely cleaned, while the floors of inner patios were well swept. Furthermore, necklace pieces are very small objects, often measuring a few millimeters long. Dur ing excavations, varying quantities of necklace pieces found from one architectural compound to another are due to differences in the sifting method and the size of the excavated area. Complete necklaces or clus ters of beads are rarely found in household contexts, suggesting that these personal belongings were taken away by their owners when houses were abandoned. Isolated beads and pendants, randomly distributed in the domestic archaeological context, were probably lost elements from broken necklaces. Funerary use. Complete necklaces made of beads and pendants were found around the necks of individu als in six Moche IV burials in the Moche urban sec tor (Bernier 2006: 192-194; Chapdelaine 1999: 46; Donnan and Mackey 1978: 132-139, 180; Tello et al. 2003: 242; Tello and Delabarde 2002: 140-143).6 Some necklace elements worn by the deceased show traces of wear. They were probably not created specifi cally for burial offerings, but rather they belonged to the person during life and were included among his or Table 4.

Simple necklaces are also present in a few wealthier burials of adult males associated with monumental ar chitecture, although these are made of semi-precious stones in most cases (Bourget 2006: 38; Chauchat and Gutierrez 2001: 135-136; Tello 2004: 209-212; Tu finio 2002: 45).7 At the site of Moche, as elsewhere in the Moche territory, funerary contexts show that beads and pendants were accessible to adults and children of both sexes (Bennett 1939: 30-31; Donnan and Mackey 1978: 66; Donnan and McClelland 1999: 55, 114-115, 146-154; Millaire 2002: 121). Local production. Archaeological evidence uncovered in the last decade indicates that most necklace elements were produced by local craftsmen living in the Moche urban sector. A ceramic workshop specializing in the manufacture of ritual objects was discovered and par tially excavated by archaeologists from the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, providing new data concerning ce ramic production at the site (Armas 1998; Uceda and Armas 1998). The workshops occupation was limited to the Moche IV phase and it had been renovated three times. Comprising at least 15 rooms and perhaps oc cupying an entire architectural compound, the working area was dedicated mainly to the production of figurines and musical instruments. Molded figurative pendants were also manufactured, as indicated by the discovery of nine pendant molds and 38 finished pendants associat ed with floors (Figure 3). Floor-intrusive kilns, grinding stones, matrices, molds, unfired pieces, pigments, and tools were discovered in the ceramic workshop, suggest ing that all steps of ceramic production were undertaken there, from clay processing to final firing (Uceda and Armas 1997; 1998). Geometric clay beads, very easy to make, probably were not produced in the workshop by specialized ceramists. Such beads were hand shaped, as they often show fingerprints, and were probably made by anyone when needed. Three workshops dedicated to the production of stone beads and pendants were discovered and excavat ed in the Moche urban sector (Bernier 2005: 215-219; 2010: 27-28; Chapdelaine et al. 2003: 164; Chiguala et al. 2006: 149, 195-199). The largest lapidary workshop, located in Compound 12, is 30 square meters in size and was renovated three times (Chapdelaine et al. 2003: 164). Two additional workshops showed very similar types of material evidence with regard to technology of production and tools, as well as style and iconography of the finished products. The second area dedicated to stone adornment production was discovered in Compound 37, limited to one occupational floor and concentrated in a single room of which six square meters were excavated (Bernier 2005: 215-219). Recendy discovered and excavated, the third lapidary workshop was located in Compound 17. The working area extends over 17 m2 in a single room that was renovated three times (Chiguala et al. 2006: 149, 195 199). It is noteworthy that beads and pendants crafted in these ceramic and lapidary workshops are identical to those found in domestic contexts at Moche. Since the manufacture of stone adornments does not necessarily require permanent structures, archaeo logical evidence of lapidary work is essentially com posed of high concentrations of small objects aban doned by artisans, such as blanks, cutting debris, beads and pendants broken or abandoned in the process of manufacture (Figures 4 and 5), as well as finished adornments (Figure 6).8 Various tools were also pres ent in stone working areas: copper needles and awls, polishers, blades, and grinding stones (Figure 7; Tables 5 to 7). Steatite-like local stone was the most abundant material used by the artisans in order to make beads and pendants (see Table 1). This soft stone was not re cycled and was probably not of great value. Turquoise was also used in the workshop to make small beads, tesserae, and inlays. This valuable stone was much more difficult to acquire than steatite; it was acquired through long-distance exchange networks (Alva 1994: 99), while steatite was available close to the site of Moche, in the lower Moche valley. Even the smallest pieces and debris of turquoise were thus re-used and re-cut to make minute irregular beads. Representations of Figurative Personal Adornments Recurrent images depicted by the means of beads and pendants generally depict plants, animals, human fig ures, or objects (see Table 3). Most of these figurative 98</page><page sequence="9">Bernier: Personal adornments at Moche, north coast of Peru symbols are not exclusive to personal adornments. They can be seen in complex narrative scenes painted on ritual ceramic vessels. This thematic relation indi cates that figurative adornments possessed a symbolic value. Moche artisans drew on a collective system of images that was wide-spread and shared by the popula tion in order to create necklace pieces. Images represented by Moche beads and pen dants are isolated figurative elements meant to be worn on the body. Unlike figurative elements painted on rit ual vessels, they do not interact with each other in or der to form meaningfid narrative scenes. The symbolic meaning of figurative necklace pieces should therefore be inferred by comparison with similar iconographie elements present in complex scenes painted on ceramic vessels. In fact, Moche complex scenes are composed of numerous elements that are not necessarily present si multaneously and sometimes appear in isolation (Don nan 1975). Accordingly, just one symbolic component of an entire scene may evoke a complete narrative sequence in the mind of any Moche individual. This notion of divisible themes (pars pro tot?) is particularly pertinent to the study of figurative adornments that al ways depict a single element. 99</page><page sequence="10">?awpa Pacha: Journal of Andean Archaeology Volume 30, Number 1 ^B M^^^m^ ^^^^^^^^H Figure 4.

Numerous pendants made of stone or fired clay have the shape of a teardrop. Al though these pendants may depict nothing more than a geometric design, they could also represent maize grains, of which they have the appearance and size (Figure 8A). Similar teardrop shapes represent maize grains on painted ceramic vessels (Arsenault 1992: 52; Kutscher 1983: 149). Other hand-shaped ceramic or carved stone beads clearly represent miniature maize ears similar to Inca ceramic corn effigies (Burger and Salazar 2004: 151). Crucial for the subsistence of the Moche population, maize was also the basic ingredient for chicha, a beer consumed in funerary rituals and oth er religious or political circumstances (Benson 1972: 78, 82). Beans. Beads and pendants in the shape of beans are generally carved in stone (Figure 8B). In Moche iconography, beans appear in various painted and sculpted scenes. In ritual running scenes, individuals identified as message holders or chasquis run in line in a desert environment while holding bags in their hands. Beans often appear as anthropomorphic char acters taking the place of runners or as background elements between them (see Donnan and McClel land 1999: figs. 4.97-4.99; Hocquenghem 1987: figs. 52-56, 202-204). In battle or procession scenes, warriors sometimes take the shape of beans carrying shields and weapon bundles. In "bean and stick cer emony" scenes, anthropomorphized or zoomorphized beans are depicted holding sets of sticks in their hands (see Donnan and Mc Clelland 1999: figs. 4.73-4.76; Hocquenghem 1987: figs. 157-159). The "bean and stick ceremony scene" has been variously interpreted to represent a game integrated into the funerary ritual (Arsenault 1987: 118), a divinatory activity related to the agricultural calendar (Hocquenghem 1987: 147? 150), or actions related to war operations (Bourget 1989: 98). Coca Seeds. The coca plant (Erythroxylon novo gr?nateme) produces a round or oblong seed with lon gitudinal grooves (Towle 1961: 59). Beads depicting coca seeds are of actual size and formed in clay by hand (Figure 8C). The Moche ritually chewed dried coca leaves with a small amount of lime in order to facili tate the alkaloid extraction (Benson 1972: 59). Some Moche representations show men handling small gourd-shaped bottles similar to those used today as lime containers. Various authors have identified these men as coca consumers executing rituals related to the intake of the mind-altering substance (Benson 1972: 59; Bourget 2006:40; Donnan 1978:117; Hocqueng hem 1987: 114; Uceda 2004: 237-242). Ulluchus. A particular comma-shaped fruit9 present in numerous scenes has generated many discussions concerning its identification (McClelland 1977, 2008; Wass?n 1987). In painted scenes, this fruit appears re alistically, often as a background motif (Donnan 1978: 160-164, 185). Sculpted ceramics sometimes take the form of the same fruit, as do small pendants carved in stone or made of hand-shaped ceramic (Figure 8D). It has been proposed that the ulluchu is a representation of Carica candicans, an edible fruit of the papaya fam ily that contains a proleolythic enzyme with anticoagu lant properties probably known to the Moche (Wass?n 1987). According to Wass?n (1987: 67-70), the ullu chu was probably an integral part of religious ceremo nies surrounding human sacrificial practices during which it could have been added to the prisoner s blood collected in the sacrificial cup. More recendy, however, an actual fruit was discovered in Tomb I at Sip?n in as sociation with a banner decorated with metal plaques representing ulluchus. The fruit was identified as per taining to the Meliaceae family and apparendy has no anticoagulant properties (Alva 2001: 227, 244). The exact reason for the presence of the fruit in Moche art thus remains unknown, although ulluchus appear in iconographie complex themes related to fertility and human blood (Bourget 2006: 169; see also Donnan 1978: 158-167). Cucurbit seeds. Beads representing cucurbit seeds are life size, modeled in clay or carved in stone with great precision (Figure 8E). Whole squash and gourds are not depicted in painted scenes. However, they are frequendy represented by means of sculpted ceramics, as a hybrid 103</page><page sequence="14">?awpa Pacha: Journal of Andean Archaeology Volume 30, Number 1 104</page><page sequence="15">Bernier: Personal adornments at Moche, north coast of Peru Figure 8.

Cucurbit seed beads were sometimes made of gold and grouped in elaborate pectorals, illustrating the importance of squash and gourds in Moche ideology (Larco 2001: 151). These plants, producing high quantities of seeds, were perhaps seen as symbols of abundance and fertility. Nectandra Seeds. Beads taking the form of nectan dra seeds {Nectandra sp.) are realistic copies made with molded clay (Figure 8F) (Montoya 1997: 14-16). In painted or sculpted ceramic vessels, nectandra seeds are always naturalistically rendered, threaded on necklaces held in the hands or tied around the necks of individu als. According to various interpretations of Moche ico nography, priests, healers, and persons preparing funer ary rituals and offerings are associated with nectandra seeds (Bourget 1996: 44; Donnan 1978: 127; Mon toya 1997: 51-52, 1999: 7-9). Inedible, the seeds were probably imported from the Amazonian forest for a ceremonial and medicinal use by the Moche (Montoya 1997: 150, 156). Today on the Peruvian north coast, nectandra seeds are still used by the folk healers to cure supernatural illness. During the sixteenth century, the seeds were thought to possess a magical function (Ar riaga 1968: 44 [1621]; Donnan 1978: 127) and we can presume that the Moche used them for similar purposes. Peanuts. Peanut-shaped pendants are realistic copies made with molded clay, the molds themselves being made by taking the negative print of a real specimen (Figure 8G). In Moche ceramic art, peanuts appear as anthropomorphic musicians playing the flute or panpipes, as skeletal figures, or as sleeping persons (Bourget 1994: 105). In their natural form, peanuts are presented in stacked gourd plates filled with food (Donnan 1978: 178). In Moche art, such gourd plates are associated with ceremonial feasts and funerary rit uals (Arsenault 1992: 51). This thematic connection between peanuts and death-related subjects is shared with other plants and animals such as tubers and spi ders, for example. Bourget (1994: 95) proposes that in the Moche system of beliefs, the symbolic role of some plants and animals stemmed from their behav ior and properties in the natural environment. Like tubers and spiders, peanuts live under the ground, where the deceased are buried and where the world of the dead lies. Anthropomorphic Themes Women with Shawls. In Moche iconography, braided hair and shawls are diagnostic attributes of the female gender (Bourget 2001a: 103). Molded ceramic pen dants in the shape of individuals with shawls most like ly represent women, whose head and feet are depicted without the rest of the body (Figure 8H). A category of Moche sculpted ceramics, similar to portrait vessels but showing generic features rather than individual char acteristics, also represent women with the head resting on two small feet, without showing the rest of the body (see Donnan 2001: Fig. 2, 2004: 16). 105</page><page sequence="16">?awpa Pacha: Journal of Andean Archaeology Volume 30, Number 1 Death Figures. Pendants representing death figures are made of molded ceramic (Figure 81). In painted and sculpted iconography, skeletal beings are depict ed dancing, playing music, or involved in sexual acts. Scenes of musicians and dancers are considered illustra tions of myths associated with the arrival of ancestors' souls in the living world (Hocquenghem 1987: 99). Painted and sculpted erotic scenes involving women and skeletal figures are considered as religious themes by researchers (Benson 1972: 148-151; Bergh 1993; Donnan 1978: 177). Moreover, women and skeletons are generally involved in non-fertile sexual acts inter preted as rituals of inversion of the established order, during which the ancestors provide fertility to the liv ing world (Bourget 1994: 207). Body Parts. Hands, arms, legs, and genitals are rec ognizable among Moche stone pendants representing body parts (Figure 8J). In painted iconography, body parts appear as floating elements in scenes depict ing dismembered captives (see Bourget 2001b: Fig. 13; Donnan and McClelland 1999: Fig. 4.85; Moser 1974: 33). Other sculpted vessels take the form of cut feet and legs (Arsenault 1994: 287). Recent archaeo logical discoveries and osteological analyses show that bodies of prisoners were actually dismembered during sacrificial practices. Disarticulated arms, fingers, legs, heads, and mandibles were found in three sacrificial sites on Huaca de la Luna, scattered around the bodies of sacrificial victims (Bourget 1997: 93; 2001b: 97-99; Verano 2001a: 120-121; 2001b: 181). Disarticulated body parts were also used as funerary offerings. Zoomorphic Themes Fish. Pendants in the shape of fish are carved in stone and bone (Figure 8K). Since few of them show distinc tive anatomical characteristics, it is hard to determine if the artisans who made them intended to represent a particular species. However, carved fish uncovered by Max Uhle close to the Huaca de la Luna can be identified unequivocally as representations of the pez borracho {Scartichthys gigas), by means of a distinctive mark behind the eye (see Bourget 1994: 160, 171; Kroeber 1944: Plate 46). Carved fish uncovered in the urban sector, which are morphologically similar, probably represent the same species. The pez borracho bears a hallucinogenic poison and, like many other plants and animals hazardous for human beings, it is associated with the ancestors' world and plays a central role in the Moche religious system (Bourget 1994: 160-163). Birds. Bird-shaped pendants are made of stone or molded clay. Birds of prey (vultures or condors), sea birds10 (probably pelicans), and owls are recognizable (Figure 8L). The owl is a major animal in Moche ico nography, represented in anthropomorphized and nat ural form in painted and sculpted ceramics, figurines, and whistles. In Moche mythology, owls are consid ered as sacrificers, protectors of the harvest, or guides leading the bodies of the dead toward the world of the ancestors. Owls' natural behaviors and pr?dation tech niques inspired their roles in Moche mythology. Owls kill prey, carry them in flight, and protect harvests by eating rodents (Benson 1972: 52; Bourget 1994: 127 131). Scavenging and hunting habits of vultures and condors give them a connection with the world of the dead, whereas pelicans, as major guano producers, were seen as symbols of fertility (Benson 1975a: 76, 88). Themes Representing Objects Bags. Some stone pendants take the form of an object characterized by a rounded end with an indented ap pendage on the opposite side (Figure 8M). This object resembles bags present in some painted scenes depict ing batdes, deer hunts, musicians and processions (see Benson 1977: 34, 38; Castillo 1989: Fig. 2D). The ex act meaning of this particular motif is unknown. In the case of batde scenes between a major Moche deity and various zoomorphic combatants, Bourget (1994: 173? 176) proposes that bags represent the toxic properties of zoomorphic combatants, which could be ingested in order to penetrate the "other world." Ceramic Vessels. Some pendants reproduce two types of ritual ceramic containers commonly used as funer 106</page><page sequence="17">Bernier: Personal adornments at Moche, north coast of Peru ary offerings: jars and stirrup spout botdes (Figure 8N). Vessel-shaped pendants carved in stone are flat and undecorated. Those modeled in clay are miniature imitations of real vessels, sometimes decorated with red and white slip or with a rope motif around the neck. As a symbol of sacrifice and offering, the rope motif painted on vessels represents the rope tied around the neck of the prisoner destined to be sacrificed (Benson 1975b: 108). War Clubs {Porras). It is generally thought that war and battle scenes illustrated in Moche iconography represent the capture of prisoners destined for ritual sacrifice. Although the Moche may have conducted secular warfare, many authors argue that Moche artistic depictions emphasized the ritualized nature of combat (Bourget 2001b: 92-94; Donnan 1997: 59; Shimada 1994: 368). Victorious warriors are often depicted holding a kind of trophy or bundle made with weap ons and garments of the defeated enemy. This weapon bundle is composed of two principal elements: the club and the shield. Other elements are sometimes added behind: spears and spear throwers, slings, headdresses, and belts (Bawden 1996: 160). Clubs and weapon bundles are depicted as stone pendants (Figure 80). Discussion Beads and pendants made of common materials avail able locally, such as stone and fired clay, were socially significant articles widespread among the Moche ur ban population. These common necklace elements were most likely worn in daily life by occupants of every household. As personal belongings, they were also worn in the tomb by various individuals. Funer ary data indicate that local stone and ceramic beads and pendants were worn by males and females of ev ery age group and social rank. A limited number of adult men of the urban sector also had access to bead necklaces symbolizing higher status, crafted in more prestigious stones or shells acquired by long-distance exchange: turquoise, sodalite, and Spondylus princeps}1 Beads crafted in foreign materials are rare in domestic contexts at Moche. Images depicted by figurative beads and pendants were not chosen randomly. In spite of their simplicity, they were drawn from a widely-shared representation system and expressed some major themes of the Moche official ideology: warfare and sacrifice (ulluchus, body parts, weapon bundles), death and ancestors (peanuts, fish, owls, skeletal figures, miniature vessels), and fertil ity (seeds, sea birds). Occupants of the Moche urban sector were able to display their cultural identity and their participation in the Moche belief system with symbolic attributes worn on their bodies. Even if they were apparendy used by any member of the Moche urban population, it seems that all neck lace elements except geometric clay beads were produced by a small number of skilled craftsmen working in small to middle-scale specialized workshops integrated into ar chitectural compounds of the urban sector. Obviously, not anyone in the Moche urban sector could handcraft necklace pieces and have access to stone and ceramic molds to do so. Specialized lapidaries and ceramists likely worked in decentralized contexts, under the au thority of urban leaders, rather than being grouped in state-sponsored workshops controlled by the ruling elite (Bernier 2005:242; 2010:36-37). Although workshops were located relatively close to the seat of elite activities in a major political, religious and administrative center of the Moche state, they were modest in size and distrib uted among many domestic structures. Why were beads and pendants produced, ex changed, given, and worn? Certainly, they were ap preciated elements of body decoration, more accessible than costly metal adornments. On the other hand, be yond their aesthetic functions and qualities, they most likely ftdfilled a role interlinked with the social rela tions and political motivations of Moche urban dwell ers. Even if all necklaces did not necessarily express a precise religious idea, as in the case of geometric pieces for example, they all expressed an intention by urban dwellers to indicate a certain social status or sense of belonging to the Moche social system. Beads and pendants were small and light weight; they could be easily accumulated, exchanged, given, and displayed. Not cosdy to produce and yet symbolically charged, highly visible because worn on the body, beads and pendants could have been convenient tools used 107</page><page sequence="18">?awpa Pacha: Journal of Andean Archaeology Volume 30, Number 1 by urban leaders in status-building strategies. We know that households and lineages of the Moche urban sector maintained close ties and relations of exchange, debts, reciprocity, and competition with one another (Van Gijseghem 2001:268-270). Members of the urban elite at Moche may have enhanced their socio-political status and promoted their participation in the state organiza tion by controlling and sponsoring the production, by possessing and displaying such material symbols, and by distributing them to allied individuals and families. Furthermore, some stone and ceramic pendants direcdy emulated sumptuary metal adornments used by mem bers of the ruling elite,12 heightening the status or cov eted identity of those who wore them. Figurative necklaces form a special category be cause they were imbued with religious meaning and displayed visual information thematically related to Moche official ideology. It is impossible for the moment to determine if precise shapes and images were exclusive to particular groups of individuals in relation to gender, age, or social role. The sample of burials from Moche is too small to determine such correlations. Figurative beads and pendants are also randomly distributed in do mestic contexts; there is no correlation between precise images and architectural compounds or rooms. Figurative necklace elements displayed images similar to those depicted on fine ceramic vessels, which were privileged supports of communicating complex ideological messages to Moche people. Themes such as warfare, human sacrifice, human and agricultural fertility, death, and ancestors, were meaningful to all members of the Moche urban population. As sacred images used in apparently mundane settings, beads and pendants were perhaps part of household ritual para phernalia. It is also possible that figurative beads and pendants were worn as magic charms meant to protect their owners from misfortune or to bring them wealth and abundance. Many figurative shapes are indeed in spired from a supernatural universe or represent edible seeds. The fact that only a small number of individu als could produce these material symbols might have increased their importance as magic amulets and cer tainly added to their value when offered as gifts. In all cases, despite their simple nature, ceramic and stone adornments embodied and shaped the identity of their users, forged their social status, and asserted their par ticipation in the Moche cultural system and its domi nant ideology.

Notes 1. Headdresses were generally made of a folded and wrapped head cloth, to which additional elements crafted with leather, fiber, or feathers were added (Bawden 1996: 123-124; Donnan 2004: 43, 62-71). The presence of headdresses in Moche burials is often inferred from metal pieces that still remain around the skull after the decay of perishable components. Ear spools were often made with a wooden cylinder or oblong cone (Donnan 2004: 77-78; see also Don nan and McClelland 1997: 35). These ear ornaments were inserted horizontally through the earlobes, in such way that their decorated ends were prominent. Other ear spools were made of metal tubes with large frontal disks inlaid with valued stones or shells, some times rimmed with a circle of hollow metal spheres (Donnan 2004: 80; Jones 1979: 57-59). Nose orna ments were oval, rectangular, or crescent-shaped. They were worn by means of a perforation in the septum 108</page><page sequence="19">Bernier: Personal adornments at Moche, north coast of Peru (Donn?n 1990: 25, 2004: 83-84). While the most common were made of a thin copper sheet, the most elaborate were embossed, inlaid, or adorned with ban gles, and included gold and silver (Alva and Donnan 1993: 177, 201, 203). Moche pectorals were made of thousands of small beads divided in strands carefiilly aligned with the help of long metal spacing beads (Alva 1994: 104). The number of perforations in the spacing beads determined the number of strands for ming the pectoral. 2. One copper nose ornament was found in a domestic context in the Moche urban sector between 1995 and 2000. No headdress elements and no ear spools were found in domestic contexts. 3. For a detailed description of the measurements and morphological attributes of geometrical beads, as well as the technology used to produce them, see Bernier 1999a: 23-29, 35 and 1999b: 25-27. 4. Average size of elliptical beads: length 8.60 mm; dia meter 5.02 mm. Average size of disc-shaped beads: length 2.47 mm; diameter 5.23 mm. Average size of spheroid beads: length 4. 83 mm; diameter 5.54 mm. Average size of cylindrical beads: length 9.09 mm; dia meter 4.42 mm. Average size of tubular beads: length 11.46 mm; diameter 3.09 mm. Average size of rec tangular beads: length 11.56 mm; diameter 7.25 mm. Average size of composite beads: length 9.60 mm; diameter 4.51 mm. Average size of biconical beads: length 6.57 mm; diameter 6.49 mm. 5. 530 square meters were excavated until the superficial floor in the Architectural Compound 9. 440 square meters were excavated until the superficial floor and 280 square meters were excavated until the second floor in the Architectural Compound 37. 6. In the burial MIV-7 discovered in a burial platform located in the plain betweem Huaca del Sol and Hua ca de la Luna, a high-status adult individual had 2380 cylindrical stone beads around the neck and wrists. In the burial MIV-17 discovered in the urban sector, an adult individual was buried with 99 blue stone beads and one red shell bead around the neck (Donnan and Mackey 1978: 132-139, 180). In the burial 9-34 dis covered in the domestic compound 9, a young woman of low social status was found with 204 geometric stone beads and 230 geometric ceramic beads around her neck (Chapdelaine 1999: 46). In the domestic compound 25, a high-status adult female was buried with a small necklace of eight stone beads (Tello et al. 2003: 242). In a multiple burial uncovered in the domestic compound 35, an adult male had 16 blue stone beads around the neck (Tello and Delabarde 2002:140-143). Finally, an adult female buried just be low the surface above the domestic compound 37 had a necklace made of 534 geometric stone beads and nine geometric ceramic beads (Bernier 2006: 192-194). 7. An adult uncovered in the Plaza 3B of the Huaca de la Luna was buried with a necklace composed of 31 tur quoise beads (Bourget 2006: 38; Tufinio 2002: 45). Two individuals uncovered on the Uhle platform were buried with necklaces made of brown and blue stone beads (Chauchat and Gutierrez 2001: 135-136; Tello 2004: 209-212). 8. Only 15 stone blanks and cutting debris were found outside lapidary workshops in the Moche urban sec tor between 1995 and 2000. 9. The term ulluchu was introduced in 1938 by Rafael Larco Hoyle in order to describe the fruit, without any precision about the species. Since that time, the term remains in use (McClelland 1977: 435, 2008: 43). 10. Vultures, condors, pelicans, and cormorants are com mon in Moche art. 11. Turquoise was imported from southern Peru or from Bolivia (Alva 1994: 99), while sodalite most likely co mes from Cerro Sapo, central Bolivia (Ruppert 1983, quoted in Alva 1994: 99). The highly prized Spondylus shells were found in the warm waters of the Gulf of Guayaquil in Ecuador, 300 kilometers north of the Moche territory. Spondylus were collected in open sea, in a natural habitat difficult to exploit with pre Columbian technology (Paulsen 1974: 597; Pillsbury 1996: 313). 12. For example, molded ceramic peanuts from the Mo che urban sector are very similar to silver and gold peanuts forming necklaces found in Sip?r?s elite bu rials. Molded birds of prey from the urban sector are almost identical to birds embossed on gold bracelets from Sip?n (Alva 1994: 21,196).
