CROVELLO Department of Biology, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana INTRODUCTION PURPOSE Knowingly or not, all ecologists and systematists are engaged in the analysis of character variation. Unfortunately, this common pursuit is too often masked by the specific traits of the different systems and approaches used in ecology and in systematics. The purposes of this paper are: 1. to outline the approaches to the study of character variation in ecology and in systematics, 2. to ascertain their similarities and differences, 3. to motivate the reader to cross to the litera- ture of the other fields of systematics and ecology to see more easily how a procedure, or specific results, can be adopted with value to his study, and 4. to alert ecologists and systematists to the possibility that if something is to be gained by a knowledge of methods used in other areas of population biol- ogy, then perhaps even more can be gained by studying methods employed in other areas within, and-by extension-outside of, biology. Perhaps this paper will be of greatest value if it motivates us to get out of our usual "thought-ruts." Some people have not re-evaluated their ideas, purposes, or methods of analysis since their graduate days. For example, many people still use Anderson's pictorialized scatter diagram as the only approach to the study of character variation due to introgression. As crea- tures of habit, we tend to think along the path of least resistance. So, if one explanation is given for a set of plhenomena, it is easiest from that point on not to keep searching for novel explanations. Hopefully, a glimpse at the many methods of studying character variation used in ecology and system- atics today will have a stimulating effect and permit the development of new paths of thought and research. This paper is only a first step towards a statement of general character variation analysis in ecology and systematics. Although I have tried to in- clude all major areas of ecology and systematics in this review, I am aware that my own background and interests influence the emphasis given to each area and method. 55</page><page sequence="2">56 CROVELLO NECESSARY PRIMITIVE NOTIONS To minimize misunderstanding, certain essential concepts, or primitive notions, must be agreed upon before any comparison of approaches can be made. An object is an individual organism or a collection of organisms grouped by some common property. In taxonomy, Sokal &amp; Sneath (249) designated the object an operational taxonomic unit, i.e., the unit to be clas- sified. In ecology, the object may be a sampling quadrat, all organisms of the same trophic level, or an entire community. A system is a collection of ob- jects, their properties, the interactions among them, and all "environmental" forces acting upon them. Some ecologists and systematists may choose to consider only the properties of objects-more or less ignoring the other as- pects of the system. A character is a property of an object or of a system that cannot logically be subdivided further. This compares with Sokal &amp; Sneath's (249) operational definition of character. A character state is the particular expression of a character of a given object or of a system. For example, in a taxonomic study of willows, each taxospecies may ar- bitrarily be designated as an object. Each has the character stamen number. The character state for object A may be one stamen; for object B it may be five stamens, etc., depending on the individuals observed in each taxospe- cies. In descriptive plant ecology, the object may be an old field and Charac- ter 1 may be presence of seedlings of Pinus strobus. The character states may be presence versus absence, or they may be any positive integer-or zero-corresponding to the number of seedlings present in the old field. In an ecological systems analysis, the object may be a given trophic level; a character may be the amount of energy entering the trophic level per unit time, and the states may be the actual amount in standard or other energy units. In a biogeographical study, the object may be a taxonomic family and a character may be its occurrence in South America. Character states may be presence, or absence, or perhaps the percentage of genera in the family that are present in South America. The reader should be aware that the choice of objects, of systems, of characters, and of character states is arbitrary. This will be covered in more detail later. The choices vary with the investigator and with the purpose of the study. Perhaps the areas of ecology and systematics that would most strongly deny arbitrariness are those using characters of organisms whose genetic inheritance has been worked out. But even here, one does not use all genetically controlled characters, nor does the choice of character states that coincide with genetic fact mean that this is the most useful choice. For example, in a computerized simulation of a mosquito population, it may be of more value to recognize only two character states of the character eye color: wild type and nonwild type. We must also consider the two primitive notions of character space and object space. Character space is an abstraction that describes a system, each</page><page sequence="3">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 57 dimension of which is a character of the system or a function of one or more characters of the system. Object space describes a system, each dimen- sion of which is an object of the system or a function of one or more ob- jects of the system. In both spaces, if more than three dimensions are in- volved, the space is considered a hyperspace. I shall adopt the view that any ecologist or systematist works with a system. Such a view probably considers the term system to be of wider ap- plicability than would be accepted by some ecologists, who would restrict it to ecological systems. But the taxonomist does work with systems. To some, the system consists only of objects, the specimens or populations being clas- sified. For others, the specimens are linked due to evolutionary processes. The biosystematist interested in pollination systems or in a comparison of life tables of strains of mosquitoes, certainly works with a system. If the reader will agree (at least ad hoc) that all ecologists and system- atists work with systems as defined above, then I suggest that all are inter- ested either in the description of the system or in the explanation of how the system, with its particular pattern, arose and maintains itself. Some- times a system is so well known or considered in such a simple way that no formal systems description is undertaken. I shall consider the analysis of character variation as first generating a description of a system and then contributing to an explanation of its origin and maintenance. HISTORY OF THE STUDY OF CHARACTER VARIATION IN ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS Obviously, any observer who compares two objects with respect to the same character (and in terms of the same character states) is involved in a character variation analysis. In ecology and systematics, analysis of charac- ter variation began as a response to a need for such analysis in attempts to understand an organism's structural and ecological variation and covaria- tion. The history of the subfields of ecology and systematics can be found in several texts, such as Mayr's (159). These deal mainly with the specific facts about each discipline. It would be valuable also to have one simple, annotated chronology listing the introduction of the various tools and tech- niques of character variation used in all areas of ecology and systematics. THE CHARACTER VAPIATION ANALYSIS Being a function of the investigator's purpose, of his resources, and of the specific biological system under study, the procedure used to analyze character variation will vary with the investigation. Nevertheless, it is prof- itable to consider each character variation analysis as one instance derived from a general, multistage process. This section presents the general proce- dure in detail. It emphasizes that the procedure is a multistage decision process and that each stage (and its set of substages) requires often quite arbitrary decisions, as to how to carry out the given stage. I will present only the model of character variation analysis, due to space</page><page sequence="4">58 CROVELLO limitations. Actual examples will be used only to make the meaning of a certain stage or substage clear. Table 1 lists the stages and substages of the character variation analysis process. PURPOSE OF THE ANALYSIS Clear statement of the purpose.-A concise, clear statement of the pur- pose of the planned character variation analysis is essential. Frequently, in- vestigators assume that their reasons for studying character variation are both obvious and clearcut. Decisions as to the "best" method for the study of character variation and the "best" characters to use are partly a function of one's purpose and may change with different purposes. Having stated the purpose of the study, the analyst of character variation must then consider the following points: Value of the study to science.-Many argue that any knowledge is of value to the advancement of science. But two facts must be considered: 1. some kinds of knowledge are more valuable than others at any given point in the development of science, and 2. only a finite amount of human and other resources are available for ecology and systematics. As a result, deci- sions must be made as to what studies should be carried out. But, as is true for most of the stages and substages of the character variation analysis process, an objective, nonarbitrary decision function does not exist to deter- mine the relative values to science of different character variation studies in a given field or subfield. Relevance of the study to society.-As ecological problems become more important to the future of society, there is pressure to make every study socially relevant. This demand has two distinct sources. The first is eco- nomic. If granting agencies give money only for proposed character varia- tion studies that are relevant to society's problems, then most researchers who want to remain active will move to such research. Secondly, potential students of ecology and systematics will refuse to enter this career unless its relevance to society is made clear. Perhaps we need a Manifesto as well as an Annual Ecology Day. Such a document should indicate clearly, however, that much of practical value has come from basic research. Feasibility of the character variation analysis.-Most problems in ecology and systematics are complex and cannot be separated into isolated compo- nents for analytical laboratory study as easily as some problems concerning systems in molecular and cell biology. It is often difficult to know in advance the amount of time, equipment, and manpower that will be necessary. Most projects require years to complete-e.g., a study of the spruce bud- worm in Canada or a monograph of the genus Ranunculus. Granting agen- cies and administrators usually demand frequent reports and do not fund projects for long periods of time all at once. This is unfortunate if it splin-</page><page sequence="5">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 59 TABLE 1.

Potential of the study to fulfill its stated purpose.-At least two aspects of this substage must be considered, the quality and the quantity of the pro- posed character variation analysis. By the quality of the research I mean the ability of the results to provide a definite choice between the alternative hypotheses formulated for the purpose of the study. That is, will the re- search be germane to the purpose, or will it just give us more information of uncertain value about the system under study? By the quantity of re- search I mean whether, although it is germane research, the character varia- tion analysis program will have sufficient power to discriminate between al- ternative hypotheses or whether it will result only in inconclusive evidence about the hypotheses under test. DATA ACCUMULATION Relevant information search.-Significant research in ecology and sys- tematics requires: 1. accurate knowledge about the biological system or phe- nomena chosen for study (e.g., the family Cruciferae, a stream ecosystem, or the regulation of population size), and 2. at least a working knowledge of the current methods used to study such systems. It is probably not possible to list all of the specific information sources of value to ecologists and systematists. Rather, giving specific sources only as examples, let me suggest the kinds of sources that should be consulted. Our information sources are undergoing rapid change in two ways: 1. the amount and kinds of information are increasing, and 2. the available meth- ods of retrieval and analysis of such sources are improving constantly, thanks to advances in computer science. The following comments are made in the light of what could be available to workers on a widespread scale, because the technology exists today. Without the firmest possible data base on which to exercise our systems models, we could make serious mistakes in our resource management recommendations as well as in our conclusions about more academic theories. To describe my view of the information sources, let me refer to them collectively as the ecological and systematic data bank. I am concerned with the structure and content of the data bank. The actual computer hardware (remote terminals, central processors) and software (special information retrieval programs, simulation languages) exist today to handle the data bank. The data bank will obtain input mostly from three sources: 1. the litera- ture, 2. museum and herbarium collections, and 3. raw data. Every scientist has a set of file drawers overflowing with index cards that contain refer- ences that he thinks may be of value to him. They may have additional de- scriptors or key words beyond the usual information (author, date, title,</page><page sequence="7">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 61 citation). A new card file quickly enters into an exponential rate of growth, but this is short-lived since the worker realizes that to keep up with the rele- vant literature in detail, he would have no time left for anything else. Often at this stage, the original set of important references is adulterated by the addition of references that are not too valuable to his research, but that were sent to him as unrequested reprints that he feels compelled to catalog. The result is an unwieldy file. What could be the best summary of the past literature in a field to incoming graduate students becomes quite useless. The above problem can be attacked from two extremes by using compu- terized data processing. Attempts can be made to capture the entire biologi- cal literature in a form suitable for electronic data processing. This data bank then can be searched, usually with the aid of a researcher's interest- profile, to produce a current or a cumulative list of germane articles. Such a service must be performed by a large commercial, government, or nonprofit scientific organization. At the other extreme, a worker can simultaneously type the information about a reference on his file card and produce a punched paper tape or, more recently, a magnetic tape that can be read into a computerized data bank. The results can include a periodically updated alphabetical listing, a key-word-in-context permutation of all or selected title words of all or se- lected articles, etc. He will have immediate and useful recall of his exten- sive bibliography, with the possibility of it being rearranged in any of sev- eral different, previously expensive ways. Any combination of the above two extremes is also valuable. For exam- ple, five workers in the simulation of ecosystems, biological control, or chemical plant taxonomy might find it useful to trade off such lists (via tab cards or punched paper tape, etc.), thus expanding their ability to recall automatically a greater percentage of the pertinent literature. Or a society might organize to have several members monitor specified journals. These selected members would pool their index cards or tapes and eventually pro- duce printed or, better, more or less deep-indexed cumulative bibliographies. The Herpetological Society is scanning the literature for references perti- nent to its members' interest now. Also, the Classification Society, a recent organization devoted to classification (not discrimination or pattern recog- nition), is planning a bibliography project to capture the literature of clas- sification across all disciplines, including anthropology, geology, and psy- chology. The second major source of input to a data bank of value to ecologists and systematists is specimen data from herbaria and museums. Many ecolo- gists do not now consult such collections except to obtain names for their specimens. But computers now can increase their value to workers. The rea- son is straightforward. All collections are arranged according to one pri- mary organizing character, usually the taxon name. This is best for most systematic work. But evolutionists and ecologists want information ar- ranged in a different way. For example, an evolutionist might be interested</page><page sequence="8">62 CROVELLO in convergent patterns of evolution of late fall flowering time, which would require him to look through all specimens in the collections. Or, a plant ge- ographer might ask what specimens in a 1,000,000 specimen herbarium are from the Channel Islands off California. An ecologist working with a re- gional planner might wish to know what plants used to grow in the Wabash Valley before the beginning of heavy industry and exactly where they might be collected now. Deciding what collections and how much information to acquire, and how to do it, is itself a complex multistage decision process that can only be mentioned here. Suffice it to say that systematists are active in planning and implementing the computerization of specimen collections and systematic literature. Crovello &amp; Mac Donald (50) list over 40 such projects. Perhaps the most ambitious is the Flora North America Program (225, 226). The third major input source to the data bank involves raw experimental data and data from any natural system. They may be data from a relatively undisturbed woods or from air pollution samples from a metropolitan county. The raw data that form the basis for the summary tables and con- clusions of journal articles are lost, either immediately because the author does not keep data records very long or, more frequently, because on his retirement the data records are so old and the details so vaguely remem- bered that they are discarded as useless. The preservation of raw data in easily retrievable form has important uses. These include: 1. reanalysis of the same data for the same or a differ- ent purpose with better or more recent methods, and 2. building more firmly on the earlier work of others. For example, Crovello (46) measured over 200 characters on over 500 specimens of willow from California and ana- lyzed this bank of data to make formal taxonomic decisions. These data are deposited on punched cards in the Herbarium of the University of California at Berkeley. A future worker may wish to reconsider the taxonomy of the group or to analyze the genus to detect evolutionary phenomena. The origi- nal 200 by 500 data bank may serve his purpose in itself or, more probably, it can supplement the data that he will collect. In other words, his conclu- sions will be based on the detailed data accumulated by an earlier worker. Hopefully the new conclusions will be sounder, since they are derived from an expanded data base. Choice of the system.-Choice of a system is sometimes dictated by a su- pervisor, by interest, by its relative availability for manipulation and test- ing, by social and political relevance, or by a combination of these. In this substage, as in the next four, the analyst of character variation must ask continuously what effect the choice of different systems will have on the final outcome. At one extreme, a chosen system may be unable to provide any answers to satisfy the purpose. And only one system can serve the pur- pose. On the other hand, the purpose may be such that any system will pro- vide answers. Then the problem is to decide how general the results are for other systems.</page><page sequence="9">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 63 Choice of objects.-The problem that confronts the investigator here is to decide at what level of organization to analyze objects. In taxonomy should one consider each plant, each population, or each species as an object? In community ecology, choice of objects may involve quadrat size and the sites to sample. In systems ecology, the choice of objects is concerned with the grouping of elementary objects into one object. For example, should we monitor larval emergence on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, and should it be monitored over many years? Or, should we just use the mean value for each week or month and average over years as well? Such decisions are examples of perhaps the most common compromise function in ecology and systematics. The compromise is between accuracy (or resolution) and practicality (or summarization). For example, presen- tation of almost any hierarchy, not just the taxonomic one, demands a com- promise between the accuracy with which relations among the objects are presented and the degree of summarization that is thought necessary to per- mit a biologist to understand the salient relationships among groups of ob- jects. Any time different objects are grouped together and treated as simi- lar, inaccurracy is present. Similarly, in the emergence example mentioned above, use of averages within and among years will result both in a loss of accuracy and in a gain of efficiency in data accumulation and processing. Choice of characters.-In some disciplines this has produced heated de- bate. Smith (240) called numerical taxonomists existentialists because they will use any character for which data are available. Other taxonomists would rather choose some subset of the total available characters according to some criterion such as alleged phylogenetic importance, relative closeness to the DNA level (protein characters versus morphological characters), or discriminating value. Actually, numerical taxonomists also choose charac- ters, but they do not add the additional criteria above, so they have a greater number available for use. What of the evolutionist and the ecologist? Why does the ecologist use species frequency, or basal area, or percent cover in ordination studies? Why is so much of ecosystems analysis dedicated to the idea that energy flow is of prime importance, followed perhaps by nutrient cycling? Are they just easiest to measure (133, 134) ? Are the same characters of prime impor- tance for several purposes? What criteria are used to select characters be- sides those in the definition given earlier? The characters must: 1. be mea- surable with the available resources, 2. be present in at least a majority of the objects, and 3. be germane to the aspects of the system with which the purpose deals or be correlated with properties of the system (concomitant variables) that are germane. How does one determine how germane a character is? As one procedure, Watt (272) recommends a preliminary screening of many characters using multiple regression analysis. This is formal screening and is most efficiently applied perhaps only in those char- acter variation analyses in which nothing is known about the relationships of the characters of the system under study and data are collected inexpen-</page><page sequence="10">64 CROVELLO sively. But since most workers usually have some idea about the system and what characters might be more closely related to the purpose and more reli- able, the preliminary screening of characters is done more or less infor- mally in the researcher's head. Choice of parameters of the characters.-Two parameters, the mean and the variance (or the standard deviation), appear most frequently in charac- ter variation analyses. Means are estimates of central tendency, or of loca- tion of the sample, while the variance is an estimate of the degree of varia- tion about the point of central tendency. Use and comparison of means should be only a first step in the analysis. Comparison of the degree of vari- ation among samples, using the variance or any other such estimate, should allow the analyst to formulate and to try to answer a completely different set of meaningful character variation questions. For example, geographic variation studies using the mean demonstrate clinal patterns. This is explained by the different selective forces present from one end of the transect to the other. But what if the variance also shows a cline? What if the peak of the variance cline is geographically dif- ferent from that of the mean? What would this mean to such biologically important characters as selective pressure? Population and ecological genet- icists have used the variance as an essential part and tool of their research analysis. Workers in ecology and systematics should at least consider using the variance as they have the mean. The next step is to generalize and ask what other parameters, statistical or not, could be used with value in a char- acter variation analysis. Choice of character states.-If a character is to be measured, what set of values should be used to record the state of the character in a given individ- ual? For continuous characters such as leaf length, it might be the nearest millimeter or the nearest centimeter. More difficult decisions involve quali- tative attributes, such as the patterning of the dorsal surface of frogs. Here, an investigator's operational procedure would be to simply recognize those patterns as distinct that best serve the purpose of his analysis. This rule sounds terribly subjective and unscientific, but, to determine character states for qualitative characters, no formal decision function exists that considers one's material and purpose any better. Choice of character state codes.-This is a practical procedure that is be- coming increasingly important. As an example, suppose samples are col- lected on different days over several years, as are the millions of plant and animal specimens in our museums and herbaria. Date of collection is a valu- able character for analyses of phenology and should be considered as a pos- sible source of confounding variation. Assuming that everyone records the day, month, and year, should it be recorded as 20 November 1969, or No- vember 20, 1969, or 11/20/69, or 20/11/69? It is relatively unimportant as</page><page sequence="11">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 65 long as one is working in isolation. But if you wish to swap data banks with a colleague, other programing may be necessary. Still the problem is not serious. However, consider the automated aspects of the proposed Flora North America Program. Its specimen data bank will easily number in the millions. Character state code compatibility then takes on an expensive and time-consuming aspect. Rohlf (personal communication) suggests recording it as year, month, day, with two digits for each. Then the computer could arrange them in chronological order by simply sorting all six columns at once. Filling in the basic data matrix.-Once all of the necessary decisions have been made in the above substages, the character by object basic data matrix can be filled in. As understood by numerical taxonomists, this is a two-di- mensional table, with one reading per character per object. I think it valu- able, however, to consider expansion into higher dimensions by considering more than one parameter. Although mentioned above in a different context, the immediate value of using a three-dimensional basic data matrix would be in a better description of the objects and a more reliable estimate of their phenetic relationship. Similarly, the more parameters available, the better the basic data matrix should be for systems models, both in actual resource control and for more basic ecosystem research. Expansion of the basic data matrix into other dimensions also could provide new data on the same objects but at different times and could ac- commodate data for the same objects but from different places. The latter is a function of the scope of the objects. If they were specimens or site sam- ples, they would be irrelevant. But if for some reason one chose species or forest cover types as objects, then they would be germane. This is an impor- tant concept in the formation of basic data matrices. A basic data matrix based on a given number of characters and objects can always be reduced in dimensions and in the magnitude of any dimension (e.g., the number of col- umns can be reduced). Either type of reduction can occur in at least two ways: 1. by simple deletion, or 2. by combining according to some function or qualitative rule. For example, consider a numerical taxonomic study where the objects are individual site collections of one species and informa- tion is present on the mean, variance, and range for many sites of the spe- cies over several years. For a certain analysis, all of this information for each species may be expressed as a simple number, resulting in a simple two-dimensional character by species basic data matrix. The point to under- stand is that such condensation of the matrix is possible and should be use- ful for given purposes. To paraphrase, we can change the structure of the basic data matrix, but this change is always in one direction. We cannot begin with a character by species matrix and obtain a character by site ma- trix with real data. (We could generate random sites if the mean and vari- ance vectors were available for each species, but this presupposes earlier information.) So, the analyst of character variation must be sure that the</page><page sequence="12">66 CROVELLO original objects and characters are sufficiently homogeneous to answer all of the questions and purposes for which they are intended. After the objects-such as local populations of a species, or sites of a forest type, or quadrats in an old field-are chosen, the design of experi- ments must be considered before sampling and actual data accumulation be- gins. Books on designs involving analysis of variance are available (34). Unfortunately, designs for other statistical procedures are rarely discussed. For example, one can read how to carry out a general systems analysis, but details often are learned only by trial and error. After a design is chosen, sampling designs must be carried out. Most character variation analyses require sampling at several levels of organiza- tion, and different sampling procedures may be required at different levels of the sampling hierarchy. For example, to measure gene flow within a flowering-plant species by pollen-tagging experiments, one first chooses the local populations to be investigated, perhaps by a stratified sampling design. Within each site, choice of individual plants to monitor may be by random sampling. Probably no extensive basic data matrix will ever be free from the prob- lems of missing data. Even when each cell is represented by at least one value, some will be more reliable than others. Few studies in any area of ecology and systematics have evaluated the effect of missing data. In nu- merical taxonomy, Crovello (47) compared estimates of similarity based on a 50 character by 30 species matrix of California willows. In one analysis, the matrix was obtained from a conventional flora of California. In the other, data on the same characters and species were obtained from a study of monographic proportions. The resultant species by species similarity ma- trices were highly correlated and did not differ significantly in their means and variances. Verification of the basic data matrix.-Whether the data are obtained from experiments by the analyst himself, from some data bank, or from the literature, some degree of effort is necessary to verify the validity of the values of the resulting matrix. This may range from simple verification of experimental results, which have been punched on tab cards or recorded in code on magnetic tape, to extensive checking of the reliability of data ob- tained from other sources. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND SUMMARIZATION Methods used in mathematical analysis are not the same in all phases of ecology and systematics. Methods vary most, not between ecology and sys- tematics themselves, but rather between their descriptive stages (taxonomy, plant ordination, and some systems description) and their explanatory stages (exercising systems and studying the dynamics of populations or the processes of evolution).

They are grouped into nine somewhat artificial catego- ries. Other groupings are possible, but they are probably less satisfactory than the one chosen. I am unable to produce an absolutely satisfactory grouping because the subfields of mathematics are related in a complex pat- tern. Even the simple two-level hierarchy of Table 2 causes distortions in relationship among the approximately 50 basic entries. Readers should rear- range the entries as thay see fit to serve better their own analyses and points of view. I am aware that the categories are not independent. One should not be considered without others. Even a brief sketch of each of the basic entries of Table 2 would require the space of a book, not an article. Thus, in the following paragraphs I shall not consider items whose use is obvious and agreed upon. References in Tables 2 and 3 were selected if they were recent, comprehensive, unique, or readily available. They are not meant to be complete. Rather, they should serve as examples of recent uses of the technique and as basic guides to the literature. Extensive bibliographies of a broad field like character variation analysis in ecology and systematics must await computerized information retrieval. References to major reviews and introductions appear next to the titles of the nine major categories that are lettered A through I. Sometimes the reader may have to cross into other fields to find a suitable treatment. Within each category the number of references will vary. Few references next to an item may mean that the method has not been used much in biol- ogy or that its use is obvious. Many references are included for an item to show the diversity with which an item can be used, to list different ideas</page><page sequence="16">70 CROVELLO about the use of a given category, or to indicate the different approaches suggested for the general method. Category A, statistics, enjoys wide acceptance today among ecologists and systematists. The concurrent development of digital computers and of improved methods of automated data accumulation are causing an even wider use of statistics and of more involved statistical methods. Interest- ingly, parametric statistics as we know it may soon be succeeded by the methods of data analysis (248: Chap. 17). To give one example, several years ago no character variation analyst with extensive data on 10 charac- ters would construct the 45 scatter diagrams of each pair, let alone repeat the procedure using several transformations. Today, even a second-genera- tion computer can complete the task in minutes. Instead of just reading the daily paper at the breakfast table, today's analyst also can spend five min- utes scanning his daily printout. Turning to specific items, the values of a character recorded in each ob- ject are frequently transformed. Major reasons for transformations are: 1. to simplify, 2. to approximate better the assumptions of a given parametric test, 3. to gain insights, and 4. to give each character equal weight, or a new set of differential weights. Autocorrelation, cross-correlation, and other techniques are of value in the study of cyclic series of events, such as communication by sound within and between insects. Batschelet (14) has written a valuable summary of methods useful for biological rhythms and orientation. Regression and analysis of variance are related theoretically. Both are used extensively in ecology and systematics. The more involved but more realistic methods of analysis of covariance and of multivariate analysis of variance are coming into wider use and promise greater insights into char- acter variation at the biological level. The final item in Category A is evolutionary and population allometry. Perhaps this is out of place here, but it is difficult to fit it anywhere, since it is not a method but an area of ecology and systematics. Yet it combines mathematical methods in such a way and has such great promise for the future that it deserves mention. Category B, probability, is the mathematical basis for most statistical tests. But growth in related areas like those listed has won it a place in the modeling of large ecological systems. For example, queuing theory is useful to describe activities at a system's bottlenecks. We may recognize two types of queues: Static queues are those in which each object in the queue is ser- viced in order of arrival, like people in line before a bank teller. Dynamitic queues are those in which each object is serviced in a different order. For example, Wenk (273) observed in species of Simulium, black flies, that hun- dreds of males will swarm with one very extended axis oriented towards some object, such as the tip of a twig, or even a dark spot on a brown utility pole. There will be a constant battle among the males to occupy the position closest to the object used for orientation. The male occupying the closest</page><page sequence="17">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 71 position in this dynamic queue at the time a female flies near the object is the one that will mate with her. Category C, similarity estimation, has been used mostly by descriptive workers. But it has great potential for systems analysts whenever they wish to summarize relationships among many characters, objects, or components of a system. Fortunately, comprehensive reviews of the subject are avail- able for numerical taxonomy and plant ecology. Readers in other fields can obtain an understanding of the methodology from them. The references given for specific items are recent examples of use and of different ap- proaches. This category and the next constitute a large part of numerical taxonomy (38, 249). In terms of the number of papers currently being pro- duced, numerical taxonomy and its analog in ecology constitute one of the most active areas of character variation analysis. The normal use of similarity estimation begins with a character by ob- ject basic data matrix. Some coefficient, or a distance measure in a chosen metric, is calculated between all pairs of objects and results in an object similarity (or distance) matrix. In taxonomy each object is a taxon, or even a local population or an organism. In descriptive ecology it is a site and the characters may be different species, each scored for simple presence in each site, or for some other parameter or set of parameters of a species. While such similarity estimates are of great value in summarizing rela- tionships among objects, they are averages or summations of some sort. This means that the particular characters in which two objects differ are not revealed, nor is there any indication as to which pairs of objects differ only slightly in many characters and which pairs differ considerably, but in only a few characters. Category D attempts to summarize relationships among objects in fewer than the original number of the smaller of the two dimensions of the basic data matrix. For example, in a study of 50 characters and 20 objects, meth- ods of Category D would seek to minimize distortion of the relationships in a new coordinate system with less than 20 independent dimensions (93, 94). Choice of a particular method from Category D is important since dif- ferent methods will give different estimates of relationships among the ob- jects. Usually, an object similarity matrix obtained from some method of Category C, a character by character correlation, or a variance-covariance matrix is required for analysis by a method of Category D. Exceptions in- clude those studies that simply rearrange the character by object basic data matrix. We can group the methods of Category D according to several criteria. The methods easily separate into: 1. those that reduce the original high number of dimensions to one meaningful dimension, and 2. those that retain more than one meaningful dimension. Many phenograms, cladograms, and other simple graphs fall into the former category. Cluster analysis is a term used to define one group of such approaches (249). Recently (26) it was redefined to cover all methods of Category D. In contrast, methods such as</page><page sequence="18">72 CROVELLO principal components analysis usually produce more than one meaningful dimension. If we begin with an original character space with a number of dimensions equal to the number of characters, the result of a principal com- ponents analysis will be a new set of axes in the same character space, but with a reduced number of independent axes along which significant varia- tion occurs. We can refer to the space of this new set of axes as reduced character space. Similarly, if we carry out a principal components, or other, analysis on an object similarity table (through the derived correlation or variance-covariance matrix) the reduced space can be referred to as re- duced object space. Results of the above types of analysis may yield a phenogram, cladogram, or set of reduced axes in which objects can be positioned. Usually, such sum- maries are then inspected visually and, from the observed pattern of varia- tion, taxonomic or other decisions are made. Two final approaches in Category D are of interest because their pur- pose is often different from that of numerical taxonomy. Reyment (207) has championed methods that analyze variation and covariation around some multivariate point or points of central tendency. Consider a bivariate scatter diagram containing a set of observed points. Using a multivariate test for the location of the multivariate parametric mean, we can construct an equal frequency confidence region at a given probability level (248). It will be elliptical in shape. With three or more characters, this ellipse be- comes a sphere or hypersphere. Staying with two-dimensional ellipses for simplicity, imagine the 95% confidence regions (our ellipses) of two popula- tions. Chances are great that: 1. the origin of each ellipse will be located at a different point in this two-dimensional character space, 2. the size of each ellipse will differ, and 3. the orientation of the major axis will differ. The important point is to discover what this means at the biological level. For example, if the ellipses from two populations differ in size but not in orien- tation, does this mean there are similar selective forces at different intensi- ties? Or, if the size is the same but the ellipses are oriented in different directions, does this mean there are different selective forces working at the same intensity? Other combinations are possible, even in two dimensions, but the possibilities increase as the number of characters (or perhaps prin- cipal axes, etc.) increase. Inverse analysis is a term that refers to studies similar to the above but inverted; i.e., the main concern is not to study relationships among objects but among characters. Many uses of association and factor analysis in ecol- ogy and systematics obtain this as an intermediate byproduct of normal analysis. But whereas the taxonomist and descriptive ecologist are inter- ested in object relationships, when they change hats and become evolution- ists or systems analysts, this previous byproduct can be of prime value to them in gaining insights into the causes of the system's pattern of variation previously described. For example, why do characters cluster? One reason is that they have been selected over time to meet an environmental selective</page><page sequence="19">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 73 force. As a byproduct, then, one should be able to see the salient adaptive complexes of characters at a fairly efficient rate. A character correlation complex actually may consist of a minimum of one adaptive complex, but if two environmental selective forces are correlated in their intensities over several sites, then the evolutionist's task is to assign the characters in a cluster to their proper selective force (19, 48). This is a good time to consider the misuse of some of the methods of Category D. Seal (220) states several times in his text that numerical tax- onomists particularly have misused such methods as principal components analysis. His argument is that the assumptions of this technique require that the characters' values, the basic data matrix, be sampled from one multivar- iate normally distributed population. Clearly, in a taxonomic study involving many different species and some discontinuous and nonnormally distributed characters, this does not hold. Similarly, Seal and others criticize the use of a distance coefficient that does not weight each character according to its correlation with other characters. Most coefficients in use in numerical tax- onomy do not consider relative correlation. Mahalonobis distance, D2, is suggested as being better, since it takes correlation into account, as well as the covariation within groups. Given such criticisms on mathematical statistical grounds, how can any- one decide to use principal components analysis in a study of many species or to use a distance coefficient that does not consider correlations among characters? I think this decision in the multistage decision process in ecol- ogy and systematics is largely a function of the purpose of the character variation analysis. Seal's criticism of the use of principal components analy- sis in ecology and systematics is valid if the worker wants to indulge in statistical inferences about the results (e.g., if he desires to establish proba- bilistic frequency ellipses about each object or each character). But much numerical taxonomy is still in the realm of descriptive statistics and perhaps will remain outside the realm of parametric statistics since it seems easier to use randomization tests and other nonparametric methods with the com- puter to determine probability levels (248: Chap. 17). If we see principal components study as another way of looking at our ecological system and if it gives biological insight at a high rate, then I maintain that its use is justi- fied. Of course, one does not use principal components analysis alone. It is complemented by phenograms, which are most accurate at the tips (versus principal components results, which are better in expressing relationships among clusters of objects), and by networks superimposed on the first three principal components axes. The use of distance coefficients that do not consider character correla- tions should depend on one's biological purpose, not on whether there exists a readily available repertoire of significance tests. Perhaps because of train- ing, most ecologists and systematists think about relationships, including distances, in a Euclidean space, where the Phythagorean theorem holds true. They also think about one character per dimension. Now, if one's pur-</page><page sequence="20">74 CROVELLO pose is to estimate the distance between objects in the context of a given set of characters, then a distance measure that does not take correlations into account may be more useful. Of course then there is a large amount of re- dundancy of information in terms of information theory, but for some pur- poses, such redundancies are important. I suggest the following philosophy for many stages of our character vari- ation decision process. For any stage with two or more alternative methods, always use as many methods as possible. My reason is that every technique provides some new, nonredundant information. If method A gives five units of biological insight into the study and B only gives one unit, but a different one, I would be an inefficient scientist if I ignored B. So, in the case dis- cussed above, my decision would be to calculate D2, as well as a distance coefficient that does not take correlations into account. In general, there has been too little comparison of different methods, especially statistical com- parisons (as opposed to visual examination of phenograms, etc.). Work that has been done (45, 49, 94, 139, 173, 200) indicates that changes in the index or the clustering method used do produce different, but not unrelated, results. These results display roughly the same relationships. For example, several available studies analyzed data via a character factor analysis and by the use of an unweighted distance coefficient (45, 173). Then if one also calcu- lates the unweighted distance between objects even over just the first three factors, the resulting distance matrix is highly correlated with that using distances based on all of the characters. Using 131 morphological charac- ters, Crovello (45) obtained correlation values of .842 to .870 in a study of 30 taxospecies of willow. Category E, decisions and optimization, is a concern of ecologists and systematists interested in description or in managing a system. The particu- lar decision or optimization methods chosen themselves constitute a decision process. Decisions are necessary in taxonomy in the formal delimitation of taxa and, later, as a separate procedure in identification of unkown speci- mens. There exist few rules on the classification of organisms-which may be a good thing. Most taxonomists will recognize two sets of organisms as distinct if the members of each are relatively close to each other with re- spect to their position in a character space and are relatively removed from the members of the other set. In other words, a set of organisms is put into one class if the within-group variance is relatively low and the among- groups variance is relatively high. Numerical taxonomy-especially cluster analysis and methods to discover relationships in reduced character or ob- ject space-is a valuable aid in gaining insights into the differential density of the set of objects in the original character space and in deciding on class boundaries. Taxonomy is classification, and taxa are groups of organisms formally named and placed in some category of the taxonomic system. Once classes have been decided upon, subsequent organisms must be assigned to one of the classes. This is called pattern recognition, and it is the interest of the</page><page sequence="21">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 75 interdisciplinary Pattern Recognition Society. Taxonomists are interested in identifying the taxon to which plants or animals belong; ecologists and foresters are interested in assigning a forest site to a particular class with respect to some set of characters; psychologists are interested in assigning people to one or more classes of intelligence, attitudes, etc. This last exam- ple should suggest that even if the set of objects under study does not fall into distinct classes according to the character set used and if a highly arbi- trary classification is imposed, then pattern recognition can still be carried out. Then the only question of biological importance is whether the results serve any useful purpose. Discriminant functions (220) were developed by Fisher in the 1930s when Edgar Anderson presented him with the problem of how best to dis- criminate between species of Iris. The procedure assigns characters differ- ential weights according to their relative ability to discriminate among classes. That is, given a large basic data matrix with objects partitioned into classes, the procedure locates the optimal characters to use in identification. Anderson's hybrid index (4) is a crude method in terms of statistics, but as Goodman (90) found recently, for given situations it may be just as useful as discriminant functions. Just why the hybrid index and its complementary technique of the pictorialized bivariate scatter diagram are sufficient to sep- arate closely related classes is an interesting biological question in terms of the minimum number of characters necessary to separate sets of organisms that occupy different niches. Of course, if the number of characters or classes increases above 10, or 3, respectively, Anderson's methods are difficult to use. These methods are not the only ones used in ecology and systematics for decision-making. For example, decision trees have been used in ecology to choose the proper differential equation to describe a set of data (270, 272). Optimization does not always mean selection for a minimum or a maxi- mum. For some biological processes (e.g., selection in a stable environ- ment), intermediate values may be optimal. One also must consider local optima versus global optima with respect to some biological characters or processes. Also, with discriminant functions, systems analysis, and op- erations research (to be discussed below), when one considers many char- acters or submodules of the system, the optimization of the entire system may come about only when no one submodule is operating at a level consid- ered optimal by itself. Finally, there is the problem of change of state of the system. Can one really optimize a system in a changing environment (144) ? Mathematical programing has been used widely outside of biology to increase the probability of making the proper resource management choice. Table 2 provides references to its use in ecology and systematics. Its value as a heuristic device is becoming more recognized. For example, as a first approximation, imagine a population with a polymorphism in an unchanging laboratory environment. Eventually, it should reach equilibrium in numbers -the carrying capacity of the population cage under the conditions given.</page><page sequence="22">76 CROVELLO Now, by varying certain constraints, such as the total amount of available food or the temperature, polymorphic shift may be made to occur. Then the relative value of that particular environmental factor as a constraint perhaps can be ascertained. This is the reverse of typical mathematical programing because here we assume we know the optimal solution and seek to generate the objective function and the set of constraints. Wilson (279) provides an example of the use of mathematical programing as a heuristic instead of as a resource management tool. Category F, geometry, is added partly for completeness and to empha- size the complementary nature of geometry and algebra. Many relationships can better be described and analyzed by geometric methods, although alge- braic representation of the same system is usually possible. Graph theory in general and networks in particular are receiving increased attention as ac- tivities in numerical taxonomy and in systems ecology increase. A graph is a geometric structure consisting of points (vertices) in space connected by a system of curves (edges). A directed graph is one in which every edge has been oriented, or given a direction. An undirected graph lacks such orienta- tion. Finally, a graph is open if one cannot return to a vertex without using at least one edge twice. In contrast, a closed graph is one wherein one can return to at least one vertex without traversing any edge more than once. Readers may expand their knowledge of graph theory beyond these simpli- fied definitions by reference to Busacker &amp; Saaty (23). In the above terms, most ecological cycles are closed, directed graphs; most evolutionary cross- ing polygons are closed, undirected graphs; most phenograms and clado- grams (without reticulate evolution) are open, directed graphs, and some nearest-neighbor graphs are closed, undirected graphs. A network is a di- rected graph without any loops. A shortest spanning tree is any shortest possible network connecting a set of points. Table 3 includes references to each of the four types of graph. Two reasons are usually given for trying to express relationships in dif- ferent formal systems, such as graph or set theory. One is that the simple representation in the new format is efficient or provides a valuable insight into otherwise abstruse relationships. The other reason is that if our data or relationships fit the new mathematical system, then the chance is great that theoretical or applied mathematicians have described the system (here a graph) formally and probably have derived certain theorems and corollaries about the system. If we can fit our data into the system, then the theorems and corollaries should hold and the value to ecology and systematics is to discover what their analogs are in the biological system under study. Another area of geometry that should receive more attention is topology, or "rubber sheet geometry." D'Arcy Thompson (258) demonstrated its value to systematics when, by regular transformations of points on a grid placed over a drawing of one species of fish, for example, he could produce exactly the shape of another species of fish.

The availability of digital computers and incremental plotters eliminates the need for selecting a standard. All combi- nations can be tried quickly. Category G, calculus and equations, is a huge field that ecologists and systematists have used most in population genetics and population dynamics.</page><page sequence="26">80 CROVELLO Systems analysis and simulation experiments with computers make heavy use of calculus and of equations to describe the behavior of basic modules of the system. Table 2 contains references to their use in ecology and sys- tematics. Again, the references given are just a few of the more recent ones, or if older, such as Womble (282), then they are unique uses. Category H, systems, is a mushrooming area of ecology, as perhaps it should be since much of the effort in systems analysis is directed toward resource management and pest control. The references provided in Table 2 include books on the subject, among which are two by K. E. F. Watt, an ecol- ogist who is also interested in developing a model of society. I list six items in Category H, but only because different people associate different concepts with each term. Game theory could just as easily have been put under Cate- gory B, probability. As the references cited in Table 2 explain, game theory in its strict sense is not directly appplicable to evolutionary games. But this knowledge itself has heuristic value. Finally, there is not just one evolution- ary game. There is a hierarchy of games, partly analogous to the games people and nations play. So one should consider the games played by each individual organism, each population, and finally (perhaps) by the set of interbreeding populations. Depending on the book one picks up, systems analysis also will encom- pass models, simulation, and operations research. I find it useful to include systems description in systems analysis. For some the latter refers to the actual exercise (with real or synthetic data) of the system described by a set of equations. Operationls research is the next step after systems analysis. Its purpose is to find the strategy that will optimize the system according to some optimization criterion. Table 2 contains several references to the use of models and of systems analysis in evolution as well as in ecology. The purpose of some of these studies is to reveal to the greatest possible degree exactly what occurs within the system. This contrasts with the other major purpose of systems analysis and operations research-namely, resource management. For this latter purpose, the analyst of character variation is not as much concerned with the inner relationships of each submodule as he is with maintaining a highly accurate account of inputs and outputs to the set of submodules. Thus, he cares little about inner homeostatic mechanisms if they do not af- fect the net output of the submodule. But such homeostatic mechanisms of- ten are the main concern of ecologists and systematists not interested only in resource management. The point to underscore is that more than one model of a system is possible and which is best depends heavily on one's purpose. Most ecologists and systematists want to model a system because of the great potential for learning more about the system and because it is chal- lenging and fun. Most workers also have access to large sets of data with which to exercise the system. The major current problem for many ecolo- gists seems to be to create a meaningful interface between the abstract model and the voluminous data. Van Dyne's (265) and Watt's (271, 272)</page><page sequence="27">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 81 books should provide a bridge for many to achieve this contact. Category I contains a miscellaneous collection of methods that do not fit into any of the above categories. Set theory is well enough known not to require expanded comment. Group theory and relations theory in ecology and systematics are known to me only by the two references given. Readers should note that the phenograms of Hartl &amp; Maruyama (107) and of Cot- terman (42) are not the phenograms of the numerical taxonomist. Matrix algebra is a necessary shorthand for thinking about and manipu- lating large data sets. Searle (221) provides an introduction to the subject. Computers are responsible for the recent rise of activity in multivariate character variation. Many of the studies referenced in this article would be impossible without them. Sterling &amp; Pollack (253) provide a good introduc- tion to the digital computer and describe some of its uses. In ecology and systematics the digital computer is being used in two major ways: 1. to carry out calculations and then, often graphically, to summarize the results; 2. to retrieve information from large data banks such as described earlier under data accumulation. Analog computers are the other main type of com- puter. These are specially designed to solve systems of differential equa- tions. Their major advantage over digital computers is that the user can observe the effect of change of parameters on the system simply by chang- ing the value of any of several potentiometers. Choice of the type of com- puter to use is a function of the model itself, of the purpose, the amount of data, etc. Hybrid computers, combinations of digital and analog computers, are available. Often, qualitative scanning of results of a systems analysis is made on an analog computer and then, when more accuracy is desired for a specific combination of parameter values, the digital computer is employed. SUMMARIZATION GRAPHICS Table 2 was difficult enough to present, but Table 3, containing the types of summarization graphics used in character variation analysis, is even more so. Ideally, each type listed in Table 3 should also be represented by a figure in the text. But the cost and space needed to prepare even a sample of those listed is prohibitive. The references provided next to each item in Ta- ble 3 were chosen primarily from publications that should be on the shelves of any ecologist or systematist, or in his institution's library. Transformations are presented as a separate category because they are relevant to several succeeding categories and to emphasize their importance, as they are given also at the beginning of Table 2. By independent transfor- mation of each axis, I mean the regular transformations carried out on each axis separately: e.g., the probit, log, or arcsine transformation. This is in con- trast with Gause's methods (82), recently used by Levins (144) to describe his fitness set. Van Groenwoud (266) also used the same technique in his plant ordination studies. Similar results are obtained in the study of preda- tor-prey cycles and they appear especially dynamic when displayed on an oscilloscope attached to an analog computer. Frequency distributions (category B) are among the basic tools of any</page><page sequence="28">82 CROVELLO ecologist or systematist. Frequency distributions are graphs whose response variable is either the relative or absolute frequency of the different states of the characters on one or more other axes. For convenience they can be sep- arated primarily into univariate, bivariate, and multivariate frequency dis- tributions. Univariate distributions are further recognized in Table 3 as dis- continuous or continuous, depending on the nature of the character being analyzed. The most common types of discontinuous, univariate frequency distributions are the bar diagram and the ecological pyramid, the latter a type of rearranged bar diagram. When we turn to continuous univariate frequency distributions, histo- grams and frequency polygons are most familiar. A frequency polygon is a frequency distribution with the frequency of each recognized state plotted as a point on the graph and the set of such points connected to its nearest neighbor on each side by a straight line or by a higher degree curve. Types of frequency polygons important in ecology and systematics include relative frequency distributions (probability density functions), absolute frequency distributions of the states of a character, and frequency distributions of the states of an index or other compound character, such as an environmental gradient or discriminant function. A dice-gram is a type of frequency distribution that has been compressed into one dimension or otherwise topologically transformed. Sokal (245) has commented on the visual bias involved in such graphs. Another type of uni- variate frequency distribution involves sets of shaded areas of the graph. A different shade is used for different taxa or trophic levels, etc. These graphs may be either vertical or horizontal. They are simply an alternate way of depicting a set of frequency polygons on one graph. Bivariate frequency distributions are natural extensions of the above and are most frequently presented in two dimensions with changes in fre- quencies indicated by isolines or by different-sized circles. With the growing availability of computer graphics software packages (e.g., 212), we may expect perspective drawings to become more common in ecology and sys- tematics. Multivariate frequency distributions are put in as a separate cate- gory only to serve as a stimulus to readers to consider the shape that such graphs might take-besides those in two dimensions that have several dif- ferent scales for the abscissa. Scatter diagrams (category C) are graphs in one or more dimensions on which is located a set of points, each indicating the position of an object. The axes may be regular characters or they may be some combination of characters, such as a principal components axis. Within this concept of scat- ter diagrams, the frequency distributions discussed above are just a particu- lar type of scatter diagram. I separate them only because they are so often used and are such an involved entity in themselves. For convenience only, I separate the scatter diagrams listed in Table 3 into those involving unreduced (regular characters) axes only and those involving at least one reduced axis. The meaning of the different types and</page><page sequence="29">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 83 subtypes should be clear from their names and from the examples cited. The only very recent type is a figure that contains reduced character (or object) space axes and networks. For example, consider a styrofoam model or a perspective drawing that displays the positions of a set of objects in the first three axes of a principal components space. Assume the position of each object is represented by a small circle or a sphere. As mentioned earlier, this gives the best (according to the least squares criterion) three-dimen- sional view of the relationships among the objects. But to be completely accurate, we really need more than three dimensions. One way to see what would happen to the object relationships if we could see further into the hyperspace is to draw a directed line on the drawing from each object to its nearest neighbor in the hyperspace. Rohlf (212) has developed a computer graphics program for this. This nearest-neighbor information is available from the object by object similarity or distance matrix calculated earlier. Rohlf (213) projected the shortest spanning tree down to three dimensions of a principal components analysis. I feel strongly that for many descriptive purposes in ecology and systematics this is the best possible summary of relationships in a multidimensional character space. Naturally, one could add a second network of directed edges (using dashes) to indicate the sec- ond closest neighbor, or perhaps the farthest removed. The only problem is that as successive networks are added, the figure becomes harder to compre- hend. Categories D and E more fully consider graphs and networks. As defined in the discussion of Table 2, graphs can be separated into open or closed and directed or undirected graphs. Busacker &amp; Saaty (23) reserve the term net- work for open, directed graphs, but the use of the term is not uniform. Unlike Mayr (160) I retain the term dendrogram as a general term to mean any treelike diagram. Busacker &amp; Saaty (23) define a tree as a graph that is connected and has no circuits. A tree would include our open, directed and open, undirected graphs. To discover methods to construct graphs that re- quire involved calculations, such as phenograms and cladograms, consult the references of Table 2, sections D and E. Category D presents uses of directed graphs in character variation anal- ysis. The first type of open, directed graphs are dendrograms. Most dendro- grams listed in Table 3 do not have explicit directed edges. But they are implied either by direction of descent, as in cladograms, or by the property of inclusion, as in phenograms. Undirected cladograms would belong in Cat- egory E, but phylogenetic systematists usually are willing to give directions. Whether they are always warranted is a different matter. Phenograms are directed graphs that reflect phenotypic relationships. The result of cluster analysis, they may be of two or more dimensions. They may be directly derived from an object-similarity or distance matrix which is based on a character by object basic data matrix. Or they may be derived from a similarity or distance matrix from reduced character or object space.</page><page sequence="30">84 CROVELLO Cladograms, graphs depicting the branching sequences of evolution, have been a major systematic tool for years. Cladograms can be drawn in two dimensions, since the only property they reflect is the branching se- quence of evolution. Over the last five years many methods of constructing them by computer have been introduced. At regular intervals Dayhoff (58) recomputes cladograms on the basis of the expanding data bank of known macromolecular sequences. Cladochronograms are included for completeness to emphasize that if one also has accurate time estimates of the branching events, he no longer has just a cladogram. A typological diagram is a pecul- iar cladogram which shows series of changes over time but without branch- ing. The term phylogram is reserved only for those graphs that summarize information on the cladistics, chronistics, and phenetics of the group under study. If information on any of these essential parts is missing, then the graph is not a phylogram, but a cladogram or phenogram. Some phylograms are naked, in the sense that only the extant objects are known. Others are full, in that taxa at branch points in the past are known in detail. Paradoxi- cally, naked phylograms are much easier to fit into the formal taxonomic system than full phylograms. With naked phylograms we are not required to make arbitrary decisions to determine with which branch the ancestral types should be placed when we are delimiting formal taxa. The taxonomic hier- archy is characterized by the property of inclusion of subsets within sets. Thus, species are in a genus, genera in a family, etc. But phylograms are characterized by taxa of the same category at each branch point as, for example, in the well-known horse sequence, where Parahip pus supposedly gave rise to Merychippus and it gave rise to Hipparion, Nannippus, etc. (63). I cannot understand why systematists wish to distort supposed phylo- genetic relations by making them fit into a taxonomic hierarchy that is de- fined by the principle of inclusion. It seems more sensible to present two separate graphs, one a taxonomic tree (phenetics) and the other a phylo- gram or a cladogram. Then one can see where they disagree and can ask the important evolutionary question, why do they disagree? What about reticulate evolution? The definition of cladogram given above is based on open branching processes and does not consider fusing processes which are thought to be common events at the microevolutionary level. Algorithms to construct cladograms and other closed, directed graphs at the species level and below should be a fruitful field of future research. A character cladogram is a graph that depicts successive changes in the states of a character, or of a suite of characters, over evolutionary time. Examples include the change of body form of deep-sea angler fish (63: 211), of Angiosperm ovary and placentation types (141: 74 &amp; 76), or of amino acid sequences in a protein. Much can be learned about the processes of evolution by the construction of character cladograms. Since only one or a few characters are considered in a character cladogram, the problem of possible reversals in the evolution of the character states is more acute. In</page><page sequence="31">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 85 general, ecologists and systematists have neglected allometry and the rela- tion of form and function of a set of adaptively correlated characters. Ecological phenograms-or dendrograms, as they usually are called in the ecological literature-are now a common means of summarizing rela- tionships among sites, which are the units most frequently chosen as ob- jects. Ecological phenograms, the results of association analysis, are most commonly used by plant ecologists. Consult the references of Section D in Table 2 for a good introduction to the field. Like taxonomic phenograms, these are the product of some sort of cluster analysis based on a similarity or association matrix obtained from one or more methods given in Section C of Table 2. Fisher (72) and Hagmeier (102) have used ecological pheno- grams in biogeography. Recorded movements over a set of time intervals can be considered an open, unbranched, directed graph. This is used quite often in ecology to il- lustrate changes in physical conditions, in characters of organisms, or in gene frequencies. Successional studies in an area often result in flow dia- grams which are open, directed graphs. Decision trees, such as that used by Watt (272:265) to choose the proper equation to describe a set of data, are open, directed graphs. So too are many taxonomic keys used to identify un- known specimens. Ecological cycles can be depicted as closed, directed graphs. These in- clude nutrient and carbon cycles, food webs, and social hierarchies. They often are pictorialized to some degree. Flow charts that serve as ecosystem models or as a preliminary step in complex computer programing are com- mon in ecological and systematic studies. The flow chart devised by Sokal &amp; Crovello (247) to delimit biological species is also a closed, directed graph. A closed, directed graph sometimes represents the nearest neighbor rela- tionship among a set of objects that a systematist is studying. Undirected graphs are used by some, but this is less informative since a nearest-neigh- bor line connecting two objects is not necessarily true for both directions. One may be closest to a third object. Finally, the results of any directed, crossing experiment can be pre- sented as a closed, directed graph. Naturally, a logical refinement of such a graph would be to use different symbols (solid lines, dashes, dotted lines) on one graph to indicate the strength of the crossing relationships, or sim- ply the order of the relationship. Category E, undirected graphs, also can be separated into open and closed graphs. Both open and closed, undirected networks are exemplified by some nearest-neighbor diagrams. In these and all previous references, the reader should be aware that successive nearest-neighbor graphs are possible and often are quite useful. Character correlation polygons are another ex- ample in which sets of lines are added in successive operations. Wirth, Es- tabrook &amp; Rogers (280) alter this procedure by showing successive cluster- ing stages. Polygonal graphs (54) are polygons embedded in a coordinate system</page><page sequence="32">86 CROVELLO from whose origin extend several radii, each calibrated with a different character's character states. The polygon is formed by joining the one state of each character possessed by the object. This is a common tool in system- atics. In plant sociology they are called phytographs. Category F, geographic maps, is extensive. Fortunately, the meaning of each item is fairly evident and I shall forego reviewing them here. The ref- erences given in Table 3 should be adequate for understanding. The first three entries of Category G also are self-explanatory. Skyline plots and sequence diagrams are interesting, different methods clearly pre- sented in the references cited. Finally, Moss's (174) contour diagrams are quite different from all other methods of depicting relationships among ob- jects. Interested readers should consult his paper for details. EVALUATION oF RESULTS AND REANALYSIS Evaluation of results is a serious step in character variation analysis. First, the researcher ascertains what the results mean to his original pur- poses and hypotheses. Have they fulfilled and supported, or have they nega- ted, them? Second, at this stage the analyst must integrate his findings with those of others. This is becoming increasingly difficult because of the ex- panding number of productive workers. Perhaps a computerized data bank will help to alleviate this problem. Reanalysis, either by the same or by a subsequent investigator, is a nec- essary endeavor that serves as a constant check on our theories and on the accuracy of our facts. Reanalysis is justified by an intensional or an exten- sional expansion of the data. Intensional expansion involves collection of more of the same, whether it be more temperature readings from the same place at the same time of year or more individuals from sites already stud- ied. Extensional expansion involves the collection of data from new sys- tems, or from old sites but on different species or characters, etc. This col- lection may be from the field or from a data bank. The distinction between intensional and extensional data is somewhat arbitrary since it can be ne- gated with certain examples, but I think it has some value. THE DYNAMIC DATA BANK We now turn to the final stage in our multistage decision process (Table 1). Until recently, at the close of a character variation analysis, information not published was usually stored in one's office and then discarded when the space it occupied was needed for a later project. The outstanding exception has been the maintenance of collections of animals and plants in museums and herbaria throughout the world. Earlier in this article (p. 60), I outlined the different sources of information of actual or potential value to ecologists and systematists. I do not wish to belabor the obvious. Given the potential of just the com- puting equipment available today, what I call the dynamic data bank could become a reality. Consider the experimental data from every character vari-</page><page sequence="33">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 87 ation analysis that has been irretrievably filed in experiment notebooks that are being discarded regularly. Today, such data often can be put onto punched cards or tape to speed up the initial analysis. As a by-product of this process, the data can be deposited into a regional data bank. Also, optical scanners are now commercially available (e.g., Compuscan Inc., Leonia, New Jersey). The scanners can "read" any of 2000 different type fonts and put them directly onto a magnetic tape. Not only would this make published material contained in floras and faunas available to researchers for new and valuable analyses, but also, with increasing publication costs, such a data bank system might gradually replace formal journals as we know them. The big problem in ecology and systematics, and in biology in general, has been the lack of a large, driving force actively campaigning to bring about a data bank system. The American Institute of Biological Sciences or the proposed National Institute of Ecology could be sponsors of such a program for all of biology. Perhaps the Flora North America Program (226, 227, 257), if it receives the necessary funds, will be able to organize a data bank system for botany. The Program will produce a modern flora of the United States and Canada. It will use a large team of professional taxono- mists, as well as computers to simplify the procedure whenever possible. But of even more importance to ecologists and systematists in general is the computerized data bank that will be created. This will include the literature (possibly deep-indexed), specimen data, and raw experimental data, all of which could be as accessible to any worker as the nearest teletype terminal. The full value of such data banks to future work is still unexplored. Clearly, the community must organize now. The methods of implementing such a data bank system are available. COMMON PROPERTIES OF CHARACTER VARIATION ANALYSES Even in the above brief survey of character variation analysis in ecology and systematics certain common properties emerge. The purposes of the anal- ysis are the description of the pattern of variation in nature and its explana- tion. Additional purposes include understanding the system and managing its resources. This last dichotomy does not necessarily hold in all character varia- tion analyses. Most character variation analyses in ecology and systematics have the same building blocks: i.e., characters, objects, and system. Another common property that emerges is that any character variation analysis is a multistage decision process and the decisions made at each stage are arbitrary to some degree. All use the same general process, and ecologists and systematists should benefit from the study of methods used in analyses in areas other than their own specialty. Also, in systems analysis and numerical taxonomy, there is value in studying similar types of charac- ter variation analysis in other areas of, and outside of, biology. Areas that might be studied include psychology, economics, and business. Often even the actual characters used in taxonomy are of value to ecol-</page><page sequence="34">88 CROVELLO ogy and vice versa. For example, the basic faunal and floristic inventory of an area, from an old field up to an entire state or country, is basic to much of taxonomy, biogeography, and ecology. Optimization is a property of all ecological and systematic studies. But optimization can occur at all stages of a character variation analysis as well as at different levels within one stage. Taxonomists wish to maximize the validity of a phylogram or of a phenogram to reflect true relationships. Evolutionists usually consider models of evolutionary processes as tending towards optimal levels, either in isolation or, more realistically, with all processes considered at once. Resource managers desire to maximize the goals set for them by the purpose of the study. Of course, everyone attempts to optimize the use of his own time. Simon (230) observed that most knowledge is organized into hierar- chies. Any taxonomic system is a hierarchy, as are ecological classifications of sites, trophic systems, and subsystems. In a way, any model of a complex ecological system, with its modules, submodules, sub-submodules, etc., is a hierarchy. Peter (196) claims to have invented the science of hierarchol- ogy, but this is debatable. We only hope that his "Peter Principle" is absent from most of our hierarchies, including those that do not involve the hierar- chies of "organized" man. Aside from its general hierarchial arrangement there are more special- ized hierarchies in the system. These include a hierarchy of purposes, or objectives. In any complex character variation analysis, decisions must be made as to the direction research efforts should take, and this is determined by the relative importance of the purposes and of the hierarchial relation among them. The problem with character variation analysis in ecology and systematics is that it continually suggests so many interesting side projects that it is difficult to keep the main purpose in mind. Data hierarchies were discussed earlier. These are formed by partitioning the original character by object data matrix into more compact matrices. Thus, character informa- tion on several species in many sites may be compressed into a character by species table. Character hierarchies are possible. Davis &amp; Heywood (57) refer to multiple characters which can be divided into several smaller char- acters. For example, type of leaf pubescence (a character) can be further separated into characters like density of pubescence, length of hairs, num- ber of cells per hair, and hair color. Sampling procedure hierarchies occur when different sampling techniques must be combined in a successive proce- dure. To obtain a fair estimate of the characteristics of a species, a strati- fied sampling design may be constructed throughout equal areas of the spe- cies' range, but then sampling within each area will be random. Decision hierarchies are found in a complex systems analysis where decisions are made in several substages and the resulting total outcome is used to make a decision at the major stage. Also, in any study of an evolutionary or ecolog- ical system, one can think of a control strategy hierarchy. For example, if a species like Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito, is to survive in urban</page><page sequence="35">ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER VARIATION 89 areas, what are the control strategies of the species as a whole, of each population in different areas of the world, and of each individual mosquito in a giveu population? I realize that this last is anthropomorphic to say the least. But if it provides a worker with insights into the system of interest to him, it is a valuable concept. Last, and perhaps most important, is the con- cept of a hierarchy of character variation systems. That is, how can one group separate character variation analyses to provide maximum value to future work in ecology and systematics? We also should not be so concerned with the analysis of variation that we fail to be aware of the opposite situation, invariance. In any system cer- tain characters are invariant over all or part of the set of objects. What does this mean in terms of the action of environmental selective forces, con- trol strategies, etc.? COMMON PROBLEMS OF CHARACTER VARIATION ANALYSIS Most readers are aware of the problems of character variation analysis. Among those already mentioned is the effect of arbitrary decision-making (concerning the weighting of characters, the clustering of objects, and the choice of the characters and parameters to be measured in a system). The problem of data compatibility at all levels (choice of characters, character states, etc.) also was discussed. An additional problem is determining whether an inference about some specific part of the character variation study, or the total study, is warranted or unwarranted. Also, how does one overcome redundancy in data accumulation beyond that which is necessary for verification? The time element is a problem. How can one insure that data collected separately, at different times and places, by different people with different instruments, are at all comparable? CONCLUDING REMARKS The reader should remember that this is a first approximation to a state- ment of general character variation analysis methodology in ecology and systematics and that its major goal has been to provide an overview. Never- theless, one cannot help being impressed with the potential benefits to both the descriptive and explanatory phases of ecology and systematics when its workers consider the use of the contents and methods of each other's fields.
