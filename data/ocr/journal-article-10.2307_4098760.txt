In many medical applications involving the administration of iodine-131 (1311I) in the form of iodide (I-), most of the dose is delivered to the thyroid gland. To reliably estimate the thy- roid absorbed dose, the following data are required: the thy- roid gland size (i.e. mass), the fractional uptake of 13I by the thyroid, the spatial distribution of '31I within the thyroid, and the length of time 1311 is retained in the thyroid before it is released back to blood, distributed in other organs and tissues, and excreted from the body. Estimation of absorbed dose to nonthyroid tissues likewise requires knowledge of the time course of activity in each organ. Such data are rarely avail- able, however, and therefore dose calculations are generally based on reference models. The MIRD and ICRP have pub- lished metabolic models and have calculated absorbed doses per unit intake for many nuclides and radioactive pharma- ceuticals. Given the activity taken into the body, one can use such models and make reasonable calculations for average organ doses. When normal retention and excretion pathways are altered, the baseline models need to be modified, and the resulting organ dose estimates are subject to larger errors. This paper describes the historical evolution of radioactive isotopes in medical diagnosis and therapy. We nonmathemat- ically summarize the methods used in current practice to es- timate absorbed dose and summarize some of the risk data that have emerged from medical studies of patients with spe- cial attention to dose and effects observed in those who re- ceived 1311-iodide in diagnosis and/or therapy. C 2006 by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION Nuclear medicine began with the use of radioactivity to trace the absorption, fate and excretion of radioactive iso- topes of normal body constituents, such as iodine, potas- sium, sodium, calcium and iron. With the development of imaging equipment in the early 1950s, imaging of bodily functions proceeded rapidly. Nuclear medicine went on to apply labeled compounds to study biochemical pathways, for example, the delineation of the biokinetic pathways in the Krebs cycle and photosynthesis based on the changing concentration of carbon-14 (14C)-labeled molecules. Diagnostic and therapeutic applications appeared at about the same time. The earliest applications of man-made radioactivity included attempts to treat cancer. The earliest treatment of cancer had used y rays from naturally occur- ring radium and implanted radon gas seeds in the treatment of uterine cancer. Within 2 years after the first medical cy- clotron was installed in Berkeley in 1937, phosphorus-32 (32P) was produced and administered in an attempt to treat the first of a small number of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Clinical applications of radioactive materials, as well as methods to estimate absorbed dose from injected materials, were developed in the course of early patient and animal studies sponsored by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The insights and tools developed in these early studies were improved when advanced imaging devices and computers became available to facilitate more complex calculations. Currently available instruments and mathematical tools fa- cilitate accurate estimation of the radiation doses received by patients undergoing nuclear medicine procedures. Great interest and active investigation of thyroid function in health and disease led to the early development of tracers and equipment for measuring the uptake and distribution of radioactive iodine and ultimately to its therapeutic use. In 1934, Fermi produced a small amount of 128I by neutron bombardment of stable iodine, 127I, and this was used to measure the accumulation of iodine in the thyroid gland. The properties of 1281 were not suitable for medical appli- cations, and in 1938, Seaborg searched for and produced 1311 in response to urging from medical colleagues for a radioactive isotope of iodine with a more suitable half-life and emission energies for clinical use. This was rapidly applied to physiological, diagnostic and therapeutic studies in Berkeley and Boston (MIT/Harvard), and by 1942 med- ical applications that are still in common use had emerged. A pause occurred during World War II, but after 1945, there was a major effort to produce and distribute large amounts ' Address for correspondence: Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232; e-mail: aaron.brill@vanderbilt.edu. 128</page><page sequence="2">INTERNAL DOSES FROM MEDICAL EXPOSURES 129 of 1311 for a growing list of biomedical applications. The revolution in biochemistry that is now known as molecular biology has emerged from the tracer studies that began soon after World War II. In this article, we discuss the current state of the dosim- etry tools used in medicine to compute organ dose, with a discussion of some of the major sources of uncertainty in these calculations and the confidence that can be assigned to individual and population doses. Special attention is giv- en to 131I because of its importance in epidemiological stud- ies of radiation exposure among patients and the general public. METHODS OF DOSE ESTIMATION Historical Background Methods and procedures for calculating dose from ex- ternal sources and from internally administered radioactiv- ity date back to the earliest years after Roentgen's discovery of X rays. Physicists developed models that were useful for calculating doses from well-defined sources to internal and external targets (1). In the early years, there was a concerted effort to standardize activity and measurement methods. The National Bureau of Standards in the U.S. and compa- rable groups elsewhere provided this important service. Nonetheless, even in the 1940s and 1950s, different values were used by different research centers for such fundamen- tal quantities as the activity of a radionuclide. The need for standardization of methodology led to the development of organ phantoms to facilitate interlaboratory comparisons of organ uptake measurements. The important studies by Bru- cer et al. (2) revealed widely varying results among differ- ent laboratories and led to the general adoption of stan- dardized methods for acquiring data that reduced interla- boratory variability. The administration of radioactivity to patients has been supervised from the beginning by physicians relying heavi- ly upon a core group of physicists, engineers and chemists attracted to this fast-growing and important new technolo- gy. The rapid development of computers since the 1950s made it possible to calculate the distribution of activity in more realistic geometries than was possible previously. By the end of the 1960s, a high degree of sophistication had emerged in support of the increasing use of ionizing radi- ations in nuclear medicine practice (diagnosis and therapy). The National Council on Radiation Protection and Mea- surement (NCRP) (3-5) and the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) (6, 7) disseminated refer- ence and guidance materials in support of the medical and industrial uses of different kinds of radiations. With the increasing number and frequency of radiopharmaceutical administrations in many countries came the need for inter- national organizations to collect and tabulate data on patient dose from these medical uses. Estimates of long-term health effects from medical uses of radionuclides, with particular attention to 1311, have been and are the subject of epide- miology studies in many countries. The sources and effects of radiation have been summarized in periodically updated reports of national and international review bodies, in par- ticular by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (8). Nuclear medicine imaging procedures are used in all modern medical centers for a wide variety of purposes. A radioactive element injected into the body can be imaged, and its passage through different organs provides infor- mation on the transit times through normal and diseased organs. When the radioactive element is used to label a compound that targets a particular organ, then the function of that organ can be assessed by sequentially following the labeled compound. The compounds used for such studies are all FDA-approved radiopharmaceuticals for which the integrity of the labeled compound and its safety and effi- cacy are certified. Brain, thyroid, parathyroid, heart, lung, liver, spleen, adrenal, kidney, bone, bone marrow, lym- phatic organs and receptors on tumors and other foreign substances, such as bacteria, can now be imaged noninva- sively with nuclear medicine procedures (9). The main ad- vantages are the very high sensitivity of the procedures (the body has negligible radioactive background) and the very high specificity of the targeted radiopharmaceuticals used in regular medical practice. Tables listing many of the ra- diopharmaceuticals and the amounts used in medical prac- tice are found in ICRP publications (6, 7) along with data on the models upon which the calculations are based. General Principles of Dose Estimation A listing of the factors required for the estimation of dose is a necessary starting point for a consideration of the in- herent problems. One needs to know the amount of radio- activity absorbed into the body by the different routes of entry, the chemical form taken in, the metabolic transfor- mations that influence the subsequent distribution in space and time in the different parts of the body, the size and shape of the organs that contain the radioactivity, and the size and shape of the radiobiologically sensitive targets for which the dose is to be estimated. In medicine, the amount and kind of radioactivity administered is well established, and the anatomy of the patient can be ascertained by non- invasive imaging. The passage of radioactivity through parts of the body can be measured, although chemical trans- formations that occur are more difficult to establish. A gen- eral understanding of the biodistribution can be obtained through measurements of the distribution of radioactivity as a function of time until the material is excreted from the body by urine, stool or other (usually minor) pathways such as exhalation, perspiration and hair formation. Given knowledge of the biological, physical and chem- ical factors noted above, one then needs to calculate the pattern of energy absorbed in the different tissues from var- ious radiations (ol particles, 3 particles, y rays and X rays)</page><page sequence="3">130 BRILL ET AL. emitted during the radioactive decay processes for the par- ticular radionuclides administered and any transformations they undergo in the body. The energies and abundances of the radiations emitted during decay for a particular radio- nuclide generally have the lowest inherent error among these factors. Except for the lowest energy of least frequent emissions (e.g. Auger electrons), these quantities are rela- tively easy to determine, with uncertainties of 1% or less. Calculation of the energy absorbed in one part of the body per unit energy emitted in another is established by theo- retical means [e.g., by assuming that 100% of "short- range" emissions (such as at particles or electrons) are en- tirely absorbed within the region where they are emitted] or through modeling of radiation transport and absorption of more penetrating emissions through analytical means (10) or simulation (11). To some degree, the uncertainty in these calculations can be controlled, e.g. in a Monte Carlo analysis by increasing the number of particle histories sim- ulated. There are a number of important differences between or- gan dose estimates derived from internal emitters (like 1311 discussed herein), and from external X-ray exposures, dis- cussed by Stovall et al. (12) in this issue. The dose to the thyroid from X-ray tubes falls off at the edges of the field, but it is essentially uniform within the portion of the tissue that is located within the irradiated field. The dose to the thyroid from the internal emitter 1311 depends on its radia- tion properties and its distribution and retention pattern within the gland. The distribution of the radionuclide may be relatively uniform in the normal thyroid gland, but it can be highly nonuniform in nodule-containing glands, as oc- curs in persons on iodine-deficient diets. Knowledge of the changing spatial and temporal distribution of radioactivity is needed for internal dosimetry, and this adds a level of complexity to the dosimetry task. The nonuniform uptake of '3'I in iodine-deficient glands is an accepted fact, but the dosimetric consequences are not well established at the cel- lular level. Theory suggests that in such cases the '3'I par- ticles would tend to deposit energy nonuniformly through an iodine-deficient thyroid gland (13-17). If follicles that are undergoing mitotic activity have diminished functional uptake and less active storage of radioactive iodine, lower absorbed doses would be received by radiosensitive cells in follicles undergoing mitosis than would be the case when thyroid follicles are exposed to external radiations, the dose from which is independent of local variations in thyroid function. The extent of such dose disparities could support a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) lower than 1 for I1I, a hypothesis that is compatible with most animal stud- ies (18). The one well-designed animal study that showed an RBE equal to or greater than 1 (19) used Long-Evans rats, a poorly inbred strain, which responded differently to 13JI dose than was reported in many studies involving more established strains of rodents. MIRD System ICRP and MIRD use similar equations, but somewhat different notations, to calculate absorbed doses from inter- nal irradiation. The equation for absorbed dose in the MIRD system (20) is given as DOr - k AhS(k h), (1) h where Drk is absorbed dose (rad or Gy) in the target region r, of the body (usually an organ or a tissue) and Ah is the cumulated activity ([tCi h or MBq s) in a source region rh of the body. If activity is in units of MBq and time is in units of seconds, A will have units of MBq s. This corre- sponds to the total number of disintegrations that will occur in the source region rh over time (i.e., to complete decay). One MBq s is equivalent to 106 disintegrations; 1 Ci h is equivalent to 1.33 X 108 disintegrations. The factor S takes into account the fact that the absorbed dose in the target region rk is due not only to the activity of the considered radionuclide in that region but also to the activities in other regions r, of the body (called source re- gions). The factor S is expressed as k nEii(rk &lt;-- rh) S(rk h) , (2) mrk where n, is the number of radiations with average energy E; emitted per nuclear transition, E, is the energy per radi- ation (MeV), ;(rk, rh) is the fraction of energy emitted in source region rh that is absorbed in the target region r, (absorbed fraction), mrk is the mass of target region rk (g or kg), and k is the unit conversion factor (rad g/pICi h MeV or Gy kg/MBq s MeV). Useful Publications and Resources To explain and facilitate calculations in their respective dosimetry systems, publications have been developed by the MIRD and ICRP committees. A selected list of MIRD Pamphlets, which are documents usually containing mate- rial needed to implement the MIRD system for internal dose calculations, including equations, data, methods, etc., is given in Table 1 (21). The MIRD committee also pre- pared books and dose estimate reports (Table 2). The Ra- diation Dose Assessment Resource (RADAR) group, which was formed to provide data needed for dose calculations to the user community rapidly and in electronic form (22), is also an important source of information. Most helpful are the tabulations of numerical values for the various quantities in these equations, particularly for the decay data (values of ni and E,) (23), absorbed fractions (4) (10, 24), and combined factors such as S for selected ra- dionuclides (25, 26). Absorbed fractions (i are calculated using mathematical representations of the human body, which provide the organ masses (see Eqs. 1 and 2).

The absorbed fractions derived from Monte Carlo radiation studies using these phantoms were then used to calculate the dose conversion factors (S values, as defined above) in MIRD Pamphlet No. 11 (25). An improved set of absorbed fractions for a slight- ly different adult phantom and for five other individuals representing children of different ages (newborn, 1 year old, 5 years old, 10 years old, and 15 years old) was pub- lished in 1987 by Cristy and Eckerman (27). Then, in 1995, four phantoms representing the adult female, both nonpreg- nant and at three stages of pregnancy, were published (28). The ICRP has adopted the Cristy/Eckerman phantoms for use in calculating dose factors for children and adults for radiopharmaceuticals (6, 7) as well as for population doses from radionuclides (29). The MIRD Committee has so far endorsed only its own anthropomorphic phantom from 1975 as acceptable for dose calculations. Nonetheless, dose factors for many radionuclides were developed for most of these phantoms in the MIRDOSE and OLINDA computer programs (26, 30), which have been widely accepted and used by the scientific community. A significant effort is under way to use medical images as the basis for more realistic phantoms (31) and more detailed, three-dimension- al treatments of radiation dose (e.g. 32), but this remains a research area at present. The MIRD Committee has published a handful of doc- uments seeking to establish standardized biokinetics for se- lected radiopharmaceuticals. The ICRP has produced much of the most useful material in this regard, establishing met- abolic models for almost every element (33) and over 120 radiopharmaceuticals (6, 7). The ICRP has developed dose conversion factors, which give the cumulative doses ab- sorbed in most organs and the effective dose per unit in- halation or ingestion for many hundreds of radionuclides (29, 34, 35). These standardized models are helpful in gen- TABLE 2 Selected MIRD Dose Estimate Reportsa Report no.

This standardization process typically employs conser- vative assumptions and mean values for all quantities in the equations above, and thus the tabulated values include sub- stantial uncertainties when applied to specific individuals. Many useful dose factors for radiopharmaceuticals and ra- diation worker or general population exposure (from inha- lation or ingestion of radionuclides) are available in elec- tronic form through the RADAR web site (22). MAIN SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE DOSE ESTIMATES The reliability of calculated absorbed doses from internal emitters used in medical applications depends in part on the ability to measure and know accurately the amount and kind of radioactive materials taken into the body. Further measurements made using clinical imaging or detection ap- paratus indicate for how long and in what amounts the ra- diopharmaceuticals reside in different body regions (or- gans). Given the chemical form of the labeled compounds, data (albeit not very precisely known) on the distribution of the activity in the different organs, and knowledge of organ mass, one can calculate average absorbed organ dose within a 10% accuracy (36). Individual differences in tracer metabolism (kinetics) and anatomy result in broad dose dis- tributions when data based on mathematical phantoms are ascribed to populations about which one has little or no information on anatomy, physiology and the amount of ra- dioactivity that they may have taken in from environmental exposures. The quantities related to energy emission and absorption are generally associated with low uncertainties. The largest sources of uncertainties in internal dose calculations are typically related to the biokinetic model for a radionuclide or radiopharmaceutical and the physical size and shape of subjects and their organs. People vary considerably in many ways that affect absorbed dose, including nutritional status, medications taken, health status, the size and shape of their organs, exposure to potential carcinogens, and their indi- vidual radiosensitivity profiles. Of note is the fact that the biokinetics of many compounds has been determined only in animal populations and extrapolated to humans, with nu- merous unknowns. The uncertainties of such extrapolations have yet to be studied in any systematic way. In the end, dose estimates require multiplication and di- vision of the various quantities, so the propagated uncer- tainties are generally assumed to be represented by a func- tion of the sums of the relative uncertainties squared of each term. Absorbed organ doses are usually given as sin- gle values, without associated uncertainties, because the un- certainties in the "biological" values often have not been well characterized. ESTIMATION OF DOSES FROM 1311 Among the many radionuclides used in nuclear medicine, 131I, with a physical half-life of 8.04 days, plays an impor- tant role. The metabolism of 131I administered in iodide form (or in any other common chemical form) is the same as that of stable iodide; and as iodide, 131I concentrates in the thyroid. In contrast, 131I administered as a marker at- tached to a specific chemical compound is subjected to the metabolism of the chemical compound and the 13'I, unless detached from the compound, does not concentrate in the thyroid. To avoid such unintended accumulation, KI is ad- ministered to the subject, as discussed in a later section. The estimation of doses from '13I administered as iodide for diagnostic purposes, as iodide for therapeutic purposes, and as labeled compounds will be addressed in separate sections. '~'I Administered as Iodide for Diagnostic Purposes Iodide metabolism is probably the most studied and best understood metabolic system in the body. Iodine taken into the body is rapidly transferred to blood after oral ingestion, inhalation or topical administration. The thyroid gland very efficiently traps the iodine circulating in blood, most of which, if not taken up by the thyroid, is excreted in the urine, except in the nursing mother, where a substantial fraction goes to milk. The fractional uptake of iodine by the thyroid is typically 0.25 by about 24 h. In the thyroid gland, the iodine is transported into the thyroid follicles where it is incorporated into an iodoprotein (thyroglobulin) containing monoiodotyrosine, diiodotyrosine, tetraiodothy- ronine (thyroxine or T4), and some triiodothyronine (T3). There are many follicles (typically 150-200 Vtm in diam- eter) in the gland, which normally weighs 15-25 g in the adult, depending on the level of dietary intake of stable iodine. The amount of iodide in the circulation that is trapped by the thyroid depends upon the concentration of thyroid hormone in the blood (specifically, unbound thy- roxine or free T4) and the resulting levels of pituitary thy- rotropin (TSH: thyroid-stimulating hormone). The iodine, in the form of T4 and T3, is slowly released from the thy- roid into the blood with a biological half-time of 50 to 100 days (in normal adults). When thyroid hormone levels fall in the blood due to decreased hormone production rates or dietary deficiency of iodine, the level of TSH rises. This positive feedback loop controls the level of thyroid hor- mone circulating and supplying other organs, where it par- ticipates in regulation of cellular metabolic processes. When T3 and T4 are metabolized, the iodine that is released returns to the circulation where once again it can be trapped by the thyroid or by other organs that compete with the thyroid for iodine uptake and excretion. The most promi- nent of these pathways are the kidneys, the salivary glands, perspiration and milk secretion in the lactating female. Small amounts of milk secretion can also be seen in non- lactating women (galactorrhea).</page><page sequence="6">INTERNAL DOSES FROM MEDICAL EXPOSURES 133 The size of the thyroid gland varies with many factors, including age, gender and the level of iodine in the diet. The reference values adopted by the ICRP (37) for the mass of the thyroid gland are 20 g for the adult male, 17 g for the adult female, 12 g for the 15-year-old child, 7.9 g for the 10-year-old child, 3.4 g for the 5-year-old child, 1.8 g for the 1-year-old child, and 1.3 g for newborn babies. Dur- ing menarche, the thyroid increases noticeably in size, and in some cases also in iodine uptake (38). When dietary levels of iodine are low, the gland is stimulated to trap iodine from the blood more effectively, and the gland may hypertrophy with the development of an enlarged diffuse, nodular or multinodular goiter. Uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid can be blocked by the administration of stable iodide ion, which dilutes the concentration of iodine perfusing the gland and thereby di- minishes glandular uptake of the radioactive atoms. The same effect can be achieved by the administration of thy- roid hormone during the time that radioactive iodine is en- countered. This is due to the inhibition of TSH, which con- trols the rate of iodine trapping by the thyroid. These in- terventions have to be prompt (ideally before radioactive intake occurs) to be maximally effective in reducing radi- ation dose to the thyroid. Given the same amount of intake into the body, blocking the thyroid, and to a lesser extent the breast uptake, results in more iodine being excreted by the kidneys and bladder, which constitute the major route of excretion (39). Radioactive iodine taken into the mother during preg- nancy is partitioned between her normal organs and in- creasingly with the fetus as development proceeds. Levels of thyroid hormone in the circulation vary during pregnan- cy, during which time the mother's and baby's needs influ- ence levels of iodine uptake and hormone turnover (40). In the fetus, intact thyroid function is very important for nor- mal brain maturation. The influence of fetal thyroid func- tion on brain maturation is complex, because much of the thyroid hormone needed for normal brain development is supplied by the mother. If treated promptly with thyroid hormone after birth, an athyreotic child ordinarily develops "normally". The fetus receives dose from 131I and from labeled hor- mone that traverses the placenta as well as from 1311 located in the maternal circulation and the different source organs. The thyroid gland first appears at about the 10th week in utero and grows from about 0.02 g at a fetal age of 10 weeks to approximately 1.3 g at term (37). Increased ac- cumulation of 131I has been measured in the human fetal thyroid between weeks 13 and 22, during which time the thyroid dose increases approximately tenfold (41). Uptake in the second and third trimesters increases, but data on absorbed dose are less well defined in the later stages of pregnancy. On the basis of a compartment model developed by Berkovski (42), the ICRP (43) has estimated doses throughout the in utero period for various conditions of intake by the mother to be 240 and 680 mGy per MBq of 1311 administered to the mother during the 15th and the 25th weeks after conception, respectively. During lactation, the breast competes with, and some- times exceeds, the thyroid in the amount of iodine concen- trated therein and secreted in milk. Simon et al. (44) re- viewed the literature related to the estimation of the transfer of 1311 from intake by the mother to human breast milk; a geometric mean value of 0.37 Bq per liter of milk for an intake of 1 Bq per day by a healthy mother was determined. This leads to a thyroid dose to the breast-feeding baby of about 1.2 Gy for an intake of 1 MBq by the mother. Iodine blocking would result in lower concentrations of 1311 in breast milk (44). Nonetheless, all responsible groups rec- ommend that breast feeding be discontinued when the mother has an increased intake of 1311.I Data on thyroid and other organs receiving significant dose from 131I have been established by various investiga- tors and scientific bodies. For 1311 used in diagnosis, with administered activities of the order of 0.2 MBq, the avail- able biodistribution data obtained in animals and human volunteers, and the S values calculated with anthropomor- phic models can be simply transposed to patients (45). Dose estimates published by the ICRP (6) relative to the admin- istration of 1311 as iodide are given in Table 3 separately for various levels of thyroid uptake and for two age groups (infants and adults). All levels of thyroid uptake are as- sumed to represent basically normal thyroid function: In other words, the value of the thyroid uptake was not as- sumed to represent a hypo- or hyperthyroid status. Thyroid blocking is assumed in the case of 0% uptake. Absorbed dose from 1311 is presented for the thyroid, bladder wall, breast, stomach wall, ovaries, red marrow, kidney and uter- us. As expected, the dose to the thyroid is much greater than that to any other organ or tissue when the thyroid is not blocked. In the case of an adult, the thyroid dose varies from 72 mGy/MBq for a 5% thyroid uptake to 790 mGy/ MBq for a 55% thyroid uptake. For a given value of the thyroid uptake, the thyroid doses decrease with increasing age and are about 10 times greater for a 1-year-old child than for an adult. The highest doses per unit intake are estimated for very young babies because of their small thy- roid mass and the elevated fractional thyroid uptake that is observed soon after birth. Van Middlesworth (46) measured fractional thyroid uptakes of about 0.7 in babies who were several days old. This corresponds to a thyroid dose per unit intake or administration of 13.5 Gy/MBq. In comparison, doses to organs and tissues other than the thyroid are much smaller; the results presented in Table 3 show that they do not exceed a few mGy/MBq for any age and level of thyroid uptake. Salivary gland uptake is clearly manifest in imaging studies, and many patients given large doses during the therapy of metastatic thyroid cancer have sialadenitis (pain due to inflammation of their salivary glands), but there are few published data on iodine kinetics in the salivary gland.

Their estimate of 0.50 mGy/MBq of administered 13'I is close to the value estimated previously by Edmonds and Smith (48). The dose estimates of Johans- son et al. (47) for adults for other organs and tissues are essentially the same as those reached by ICRP (6) with a few exceptions. Johansson et al. (47) estimated the dose to the stomach wall at 1.2 mGy/MBq (2.6 times higher) and the dose to the thyroid at 490 mGy/MBq instead of 500 mGy/MBq. They also added an estimate of the testes dose at 0.03 mGy/MBq. They presented no data for children. Dose to the parathyroid parallels that received by the thyroid, but it depends on the size and spatial relationship between the two glands. The parathyroid is located near or partly embedded in the posterior part of the thyroid gland. The parathyroid dose will be less than that received by the thyroid because of absorption, in the layer of tissue sepa- rating the two glands, and the range/energy distribution of the P-particle radiation emitted by I''I in the thyroid. 1311 Administered as Iodide for Therapeutic Purposes The main therapeutic uses of 'l3I are for the treatment of hyperthyroidism, with an administered activity typically in the range of 185 to 370 MBq, for an intended thyroid dose of approximately 70 Gy, and thyroid cancer, for which higher doses are delivered, depending on the stage and ex- tent of disease. Administered activities range from 1 to 3.7 GBq to destroy tumor remnants after incomplete surgery and from 3.7 to 10 GBq to ablate remaining localized tu- mor, while higher administered activities are used to treat patients with persistent metastatic disease. Some physicians use rule-based guidelines to determine the amount of 1311 to be administered, while others base dose prescriptions on patient-specific measurements (45, 49). Despite the fact that such studies have been conducted for a number of years, there is still little agreement on how best to use the information derived or even if such infor- mation results in improved outcome relative to that of thy- roid cancer patients treated "non-dosimetrically" (i.e., with a fixed administered activity of 'II-iodide). The argument in favor of obtaining detailed dosimetry data is based on the belief that therapeutic doses may be optimized to min- imize acute toxicity as well as cancer risk and to maximize efficacy once dose-toxicity and -efficacy relationships are derived from follow-up of dosimetrically treated patients. In the treatment of patients with uncomplicated Graves' disease, the amount of '11I typically administered is intend- ed to deliver a thyroid dose of approximately 70 Gy in an attempt to inhibit hormonogenesis. Larger amounts of 131I are administered to more complicated patients, including those with nodular glands who typically receive higher dos- es, in the range of 100 Gy or more. The activity to be administered can be determined from measurements of the thyroid mass, fractional thyroid uptake, and biological half- time of residence of 13llI in the thyroid: 1. The estimation of the thyroid mass, especially for ab- normally large or abnormally shaped glands, is a major source of error. The best approach uses three-dimen- sional ultrasound. 2. The thyroid uptake can be calculated from the admin- istered activity and of the net 1311 count rate from the thyroid measured using either a y-ray probe or y-ray camera. 3. The biological half-time of residence of 131I in the thy- roid can be obtained from daily measurements of the 1311</page><page sequence="8">INTERNAL DOSES FROM MEDICAL EXPOSURES 135 activity that remains in the thyroid, using the same y- ray probe, from 1 to 7 days after administration of the activity. In most patients with hyperthyroidism, the bi- ological half-time of residence of 131I in the thyroid is about 20 days, but about 15% of hyperthyroid patients have a more rapid turnover rate because of a small thy- roidal iodine pool, resulting in values of the biological half-time of residence of 131I in the thyroid of about 5 days. In those patients, the level of serum protein-bound 131I can be very high, resulting in high doses to blood and, by extension, to bone marrow. A more complete dosimetric analysis of small-pool hyperthyroidism can be found in Zanzonico et al. (50). In the case of thyroid cancer, the first step in 131I therapy after thyroidectomy is to ablate any remaining normal thy- roid tissue by administration of sufficiently large doses of radioiodine. The administered activity is usually in the range from 1 to 5 GBq. The determination of the activity is derived from the estimation of the thyroid mass, frac- tional thyroid uptake, and biological half-time of residence of 131I in the thyroid, as described above, however, because of its smaller size, the mass of residual normal thyroid tis- sue is more difficult to determine than in patients with hy- perthyroidism. Different factors influencing the treatment of remnants have been reviewed by Hay et al. (51). Radioiodine treatment of metastatic thyroid cancer after the complete removal of normal thyroid tissue by surgery and/or remnant ablation is accomplished in different ways. Most thyroid cancer therapy is administered using formula- based rules with minimum patient-specific dosimetry. Some academic centers with strong dosimetry programs collect detailed information on the uptake and turnover of a test dose to determine the amount of therapy to be administered. Despite the fact that such studies have been conducted for a number of years, there is still little agreement on how best to use the information derived. The argument in favor of obtaining detailed dosimetry data is based on the belief that this information when correlated with observed se- quelae will lead to improved practice guidelines (52). A generally held treatment philosophy by those who do detailed dosimetry is that the tumor dose should be as high as possible while limiting the blood dose to 2 Gy. Briefly, serial time-activity measurements are made of blood, tumor and total-body activity after administration of a tracer dose of about 200 MBq of 131J. The results are used to calculate the absorbed doses in blood, normal organs and tumor (53). The actual therapeutic administered activity is then scaled from those dose levels, keeping in mind that the blood dose should not exceed 2 Gy. After administration of the thera- peutic activity, which is usually in the range from 4 to 20 GBq, serial time-activity measurements are then repeated for blood, tumor and total body. The resulting absorbed doses are then analyzed to determine whether the blood dose limit of 2 Gy has been attained or whether re-treat- ment will be needed if the tumor absorbed dose is substan- tially less than expected. In fact, experience has shown that in individual patients with widely disseminated metastatic thyroid cancer, the therapeutic dose actually absorbed by the tumor is less than would have been estimated from mea- surements after the administration of the tracer dose (54). The explanation is that even diagnostic doses of the mag- nitude used clinically result in sufficient radiation damage (stunning) to diminish uptake of the therapy dose. An ex- cellent review of clinical issues involved in thyroid cancer therapy is presented by Robbins and Schlumberger (55). Various methods have been used to increase lesion uptake, including diets deficient in iodine, TSH administration and more recently the administration of recombinant TSH (56), as well as the use of lithium to prolong retention of 131I in the tumor (57). Improvements in the accuracy of 131I do- simetry have been achieved using high-energy collimators and improved analysis methods (36). Further improvement can be achieved using the PET tracer 124I, which results in improved dosimetry accuracy (58). 131I-Labeled Compounds Many molecules have been labeled with radioactive io- dine, and their biodistribution has been followed by mea- surements in blood and tissue samples as well as by radio- activity measured by external counting probes over the re- gions of the body of interest, and currently by high- resolution imaging devices. Labeled hormones, drugs and receptor targeting agents are used to study the properties of these agents and their role in health and disease. The ability to do repeated studies with one or multiple injections pro- vides the opportunity for dynamic analysis in resting and stressed states; this facilitates the evaluation of pharmaco- kinetics in a noninvasive manner as well as the estimation of parameters describing physiological processes, including physiological reserve. Current medical practice uses 131I- labeled compounds for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. For diagnostic purposes, 1231 is used increasingly because it produces better images while delivering a lower dose to the patient. 1311 is still used as a treatment planning prelude in an effort to plan the amount needed to deliver an adequate therapy dose. 1311 is used in diagnosis and therapy of cancer using drugs that target receptors on the tumor cells. 1311 labeled MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) is used in the therapy of neuroendocrine tumors that are found in imaging studies to have avid receptors for the drug. A number of radioactive antibodies labeled with 1311 Or Other P3-particle- emitting radionuclides or ar-particle-emitting radionuclides are used in the treatment of different cancers. Other iodine- labeled compounds use positron emissions from 124I to pro- vide higher-resolution images and more accurate quantita- tive data for dosimetry studies than can be obtained with 131I for reasons related to the current state of the art in imaging devices. Whenever large doses of 131I-labeled drugs are administered in therapy, potassium iodide (KI) is administered prior to and for several days after administra-</page><page sequence="9">136 BRILL ET AL. tion. When KI is administered prior to 131I intake, this great- ly reduces thyroid uptake and dose to the thyroid. After the administration of 0.74 MBq of 1311 MIBG, the highest organ dose is received in the liver and is about 0.82 mGy. Detailed information on age-dependent dose coeffi- cients for a number of organs and tissues is provided in ICRP Publications 53 (6) and 80 (7). MAIN SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY IN 1311 DOSE ESTIMATES The major contributors to the uncertainty of thyroid dose estimates have been assessed mainly in the framework of environmental studies in which labeled compounds are not considered (59-61). For example, Apostoaei and Miller (59) estimated uncertainties in the radiation dose estimates for ingestion of 131I in a soluble form. They evaluated the variables that can influence the uncertainty of reported dos- es and identified the following important contributors: 1. The "apparent" biological half-time of iodine in the thy- roid-a lognormal distribution with a geometric stan- dard deviation of 1.8 around central values of 15 days for newborns, 20 days for children, 50 days for adoles- cents, and 85 days for adults. 2. The uptake fraction of activity from blood, which was fitted with a log-triangular distribution with central val- ues of 0.45 for newborns, 0.37 for children, 0.35 for adolescents, and 0.25 for adults. 3. The thyroid mass, for which they assigned a lognormal distribution with a geometric standard deviation of 1.5 around central values that varied with the age of the individual between early ages and adulthood. For all ages, the major contributors to thyroid dose were the thyroid mass and the thyroid fractional uptake. Bioki- netic parameters related to release of iodine from blood and from the thyroid were smaller contributors, suggesting that the emphasis on reducing uncertainties should be focused on knowledge of thyroid mass and iodine uptake. Similar findings were reported by Aydogan et al. (62), who iden- tified the thyroid mass as the primary contributor to uncer- tainty in dose coefficients for ingestion of '~'I, with bioki- netic data making a lesser contribution. It should be noted that the available information is the average activity concentration in the measured organs and that there is likely to be a substantial difference between the true distribution within the gland macroscopically and at the cellular level. Heterogeneity causes the greatest prob- lems when estimating dose from ct particles and low-energy electron emitters. Given the high-energy electron emission spectrum from 131I this is less of a problem in general, ex- cept in cases where there is extreme heterogeneity as in nodular goiters and in persons with iodine-deficient diets. Nonuniform uptake of 131I can be seen on autoradiographs (63, 64), with some regions having up to 50 times the av- erage concentration in the gland (13). This could be a sig- nificant problem in correlating absorbed dose in heteroge- neous subregions of the gland in persons (children) in io- dine-deficient areas (65, 66), which could account in part for the increased risk observed in such individuals. RISKS FROM MEDICAL TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS INVOLVING INCORPORATION OF 131I Early experience with medical uses of 131I revealed the high concentration of radioactive iodine in the thyroid gland; this was used in the late 1930s for diagnosis and in the early 1940s for treatment of thyroid disease. With the development of nuclear reactors, it was recognized in the 1950s that 1311 was a fission product that could have dele- terious health implications if released into the environment in large amounts. In fact, 1311I released from the nuclear fuel cycle is now one of the main concerns from peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Absorbed doses from radioactive iso- topes are delivered at much lower dose rates than those from the X and radiation delivered by the atomic bomb, and hence the need for human data on the risk from low- dose-rate radiations was recognized early on. By the 1960s, large numbers of patients with hyperthy- roidism (thyrotoxicosis) had been treated, mostly in major medical centers in the U.S. and other countries. Hyperthy- roidism was treated with radioactive 'l'I (occasionally with 1251), surgery or antithyroid drugs, and since the patients generally lived a normal life span, it was decided that a large group of hyperthyroid patients treated with 131I ther- apy should be studied. Twenty-six institutions, 25 in the United States and one in the United Kingdom, pooled their rosters of treated patients and embarked on a prospective follow-up using the same protocol. Dosimetry data were extracted from the records. All had known amounts of 131I administered (activity ranged from 70 to 600 MBq). Many had received several measurements of thyroid uptake, and a small number had detailed kinetic studies on both diag- nostic and therapy doses. The protocol was finalized in 1962, and the study was continued through 1968. Reports of the first results were based on follow-up of approxi- mately 22,000 patients treated with '"'I and about 14,000 treated surgically or solely with antithyroid drugs. Some patients had multiple treatments for one or more recurrenc- es of the disease. The results of the studies revealed a small increase in leukemia in "'I-treated subjects when compared to age- matched U.S. rates, but the rates in the 131I-treated patients were less than those observed in the surgically treated pa- tients (67). A high rate of hypothyroidism was seen in all groups of treated subjects, regardless of therapy (68); how- ever, there was a strong relationship between the amount of 131I activity and the frequency of hypothyroidism. The study clearly demonstrated the importance of the inclusion of an appropriate comparison group, because without it the small leukemia increase observed would have been attri- buted to the then estimated 50 to 100-mGy marrow dose</page><page sequence="10">INTERNAL DOSES FROM MEDICAL EXPOSURES 137 from 131I rather than to thyrotoxicosis. Additional infor- mation was gathered on the frequency of benign and ma- lignant thyroid neoplasms (69). No evidence of an increase in malignant thyroid tumors was observed when disease observed in the first 5 years of follow-up was excluded. By excluding these 5 years, the co-occurrence of already pres- ent thyroid cancer was not attributed to the 131I therapy. In 1974, 497 nodules were present when the paper by Dobyns et al. was published (69). The charts of these patients were reviewed in the mid-1980s by the physicians at the four largest centers, and more than 95% of the cases were in- stances in which one reviewer noted a nodule, which was not subsequently noted in the patient's chart.2 Due to limited information on the biological turnover of 131I in the subjects in the original thyrotoxicosis therapy study, organ doses could not be estimated, and therefore administered activity was used as a measure of exposure. The amount of activity administered in single doses ranged from &lt;185 MBq to &gt;555 MBq. Assuming 25-50% uptake in adults, and given a mean activity of 330 MBq of 131I administered to the patients who developed leukemia, the bone marrow dose is estimated using ICRP data to lie be- tween 13 and 67 mGy. A later follow-up of cancer mortality was conducted on this same patient population (70). The study revealed that the total number of cancer deaths was close to that expected based on mortality rates in the general population (2950 compared to 2857), but there was a small excess of mortality from cancers of the lung, breast, kidney and thyroid. A def- icit of deaths was noted for cancers of the uterus and the prostate gland. Radioactive iodine was not linked to total cancer deaths or to any specific cancer with the exception of thyroid cancer; however, thyroid cancer risk was not el- evated when the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded. While this study does not provide compelling evidence for an association between 1311 therapy given to adult patients and thyroid cancer mortality, it should be noted that because thyroid cancer is rarely fatal, mortality is not a good measure of the effects of 1311 on the thyroid gland. While a British study of hyperthyroid patients found a small but significant increased risk of thyroid cancer incidence and mortality among 131I-treated patients (71), a Swedish study reported that the risk of thyroid cancer was not significantly elevated 10 or more years after treatment (72, 73). Thyroid cancer risk also has been examined in cohorts of patients receiving diagnostic 1311 examinations (74-77). No significant excess risk of thyroid cancer was demon- strated among patients who were examined for reasons oth- er than a suspected thyroid tumor, even though the mean thyroid doses are about 0.9 Gy. In the most recent follow-ups of hyperthyroid patients, neither leukemia risk nor other malignancies have been sig- nificantly linked to 131I therapy (70, 71), but the doses to organs other than the thyroid are quite low. 1311 is also frequently used as a treatment for thyroid can- cer. The thyroid doses for this therapy are extremely high, with the aim of killing all of the cells in the thyroid tissue. The doses to other organs are generally small. In a follow- up of Swedish thyroid cancer patients treated with 13I, the red bone marrow dose was estimated to be about 251 mGy (73). Leukemia risk has been elevated in some cohorts of thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I (78, 79), but not all (74). To shed more light on the risks from the 131I treatment, a pooled analysis of three European (Sweden, France and Italy) cohorts was conducted (80). The mean administered activity was 6 (0.2-56) GBq. The risk of leukemia was elevated, but it did not reach statistical significance (RR = 1.9; 95% CI = 0.8-3.6). In the pooled analysis, there was also suggestive evidence of an increased risk of cancers of the salivary gland, bone and soft tissue, and uterus. No evidence of genetic effects in the offspring of women treat- ed with 1311 for thyroid cancer has been detected (55), but the recommendation that conception be delayed for 1 year after therapy is still advocated. It is generally agreed that no evidence of significant germ cell damage (such as impaired fertility and increased of birth defects) has been noted among subsequently con- ceived offspring of 131I-treated hyperthyroid patients. None- theless, demonstrable gonadal damage, specifically, tran- siently impaired fertility, may occur occasionally among thyroid cancer patients treated with much larger amounts (greater than 3.7 GBq) of 131I (81, 82). CONCLUSIONS The development and use of radioactive isotopes of iodine has improved medical care substantially. Many clinical ap- plications were an outgrowth of the development of the tech- nology and the biological knowledge it engendered. Concern regarding the safe and effective use of radiation in medicine led to the development of standardized procedures and meth- ods for calibrating the amount of activity administered to patients. This included much attention to quality control of the radionuclides administered, their chemical and radionu- clidic purity, and their stability in the body. Dosimetry systems for intake of radionuclides evolved from simple mathematical models to complex computer- based systems that provide high accuracy. These methods are in routine use in all major medical centers. With these tools, many investigations have led to the publication of high-quality data on radiation dose to patients, to workers, and to the public from environmental releases of many ra- dionuclides. 13'I has received the greatest emphasis because of its unique applications in medicine and its major role in planned and unplanned releases from nuclear power plants and from fallout from weapons testing. 2 A.
