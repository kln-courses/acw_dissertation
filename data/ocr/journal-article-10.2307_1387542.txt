Like a medieval liturgical procession, this parade of contemporary commentators on religion looks all the more impressive for repre- senting factions of a disparate community that might otherwise never cooperate. While sharing a common determination to place the phenomenon of religion within a social-scientific framework, they utterly disagree on how this should be done. Glazier graciously finds a similar degree of merit in each of the articles, but in the absence of a unified theory, all that holds the book together is the editor's wish that anthropology had somehow become one. A more revealing range of perspectives could hardly be hoped for than we find here. The anthro- pology of religion, it seems, has become the repository of nearly every important intellectual tradition since the Reformation. In this review I group the book's articles according to the major intellectual movements of the last two centuries, during which the social sciences were formed. Epistemological questions, it will be seen, preoccupy anthropology as much as they do the sciences. Enlightenment positivism and scientism, to begin, sufficiently abound in the text to please any reductionist. James Lett's essay (Chapter 3), for exam- ple, reads like a leaflet from the French Revolution. According to Lett, science has a mission - an .obligation," in fact - to "proclaim the truth" about the .world of illusion" in all religions. Lett is a relentless drummer in the rhythms of Victor Stenger, Paul Kurtz, Anthony F. C. Wallace, and the like. Aside from the dubious epistemological premises he sets forth and the sweeping generalizations he makes, Lett fails to imagine just what practical effects his marching orders would have for the scores of ethnographers in the field if it were widely understood that anthropology is mainly in the business of exposing universal religious fraud. Near the other end of the book, Michael Winkelman's essay on shamanism (Chapter 15) similarly resounds with the rhetoric of scientific reduction. Winkelman infers from the assumed univer- sality of shamanism that it has its "basis" and "origin" in a common pattern of brain activity and associated altered states of consciousness (ASC). Even if one accepted the broader definition of shamanism that the claim of universality requires, one could plausibly argue, as Joan Townsend does in Chapter 16, that not all shamans experience ecstatic ASC. Does "good theater" yield to Winkelman's analysis as some shamans stage it? And what of ritual-liturgical religious professionals who expressly eschew altered states, like the priest in Mary O'Connor's essay (Chapter 14) who would rather the pilgrims did not go to all their troubles? Stewart Guthrie is another of those who prefer that science explain away religion rather than system- atically observe and describe it (Chapter 18). Guthrie elegantly argues that, in a manner parallel to Pascal's wager, we are disposed to infer human presence when- ever our perceptual experience is uncertain. This anthropomorphic disposition to bet on the possibility with the most important ramifications - the presence of another human being - is apparently wired into the brain and acts as an impulse that religions elaborate. Why they pervasively and needlessly do so, and then adamantly cling to these "illusions," is a question that Guthrie does not address. That chimpanzees are similarly animating the world when they gesture threateningly at thunderstorms seems doubtful to me. Rather than projecting onto apes the human tendency to see intentionality in natural occurrences, would it not be better to assume that fear of loud noises leads to displays of defensive threats? While Guthrie's sugges- tion of parallels to human religious experience among chimps seems gratuitous, it does fill a gap in cognitive evolutionary theory.

Glazier's Handbook has its fair share of ethnographic accounts of "folk" religious settings, which assert anthropology's Boasian interest in the local over the universal, and concrete description over general theory. Jim Birckhead (Chapter 1) opens the volume with a soul-searching account of his fieldwork among American "snake handlers." Although he gradually abandoned framing the behavior he observed in terms used by the popular media or academe, he nonetheless remained unable either to make moral sense of the deaths that the practice occasioned or to participate in the behavior himself. Birckhead is a scholar from a notably skeptical intellectual tradition; he was a fellow traveler taken into the confidence of people who assisted him from their marginal zone of American religion. Yet the locus between skeptic and sympa- thizer may be the best position from which to describe human diversity. By contrast, in her overview of the world of shamanism and the character of shamans, Joan Townsend frankly acknowledges that she and other ethnographers are apprenticing themselves to shamans in their studies (Chapter 16). Furthermore, she claims to have knowledge of shamans' effecting genuine physi- cal cures, even of infants and animals and thus in the absence of belief in the healer's power. Not surpris- ingly, she asserts a "vibrant" functionality to shaman- ism and "remarkable resilience" to neo-shamanistic religion in Western societies. The fact that anthro- pologists like Townsend are attributing instrumental efficacy to the supernatural matrices of ritual behavior is a radical departure from the scientific tradition. Townsend and her associates must make their evidence public. Chapters 5 through 10 of the Handbook focuses on ritual studies in such places as Japan, India, Africa, and North America. Providing a grand overview of contemporary ritual studies are Bobby Alexander (Chapter 5), Mary Evelyn Tucker (Chapter 8), and Madeline Duntley (Chapter 10). The synthetic analysis of these three authors alone is worth the price of the book. The further insights into the performance of religion in India (Chapter 7) and North America (Chapter 9) offered by Peter Claus and John Grim, respectively, are also eloquently presented and subtly developed. In Chapter 13, Todd Lewis puts the Redfieldian dichotomy of Great Traditions versus Little Traditions to rest by showing that Buddhism has never fit into either category. But in Chapter 14, Mary O'Connor resurrects the dichotomy in her study of pilgrimage to Magdalena. Cynthia Keppley Mahmood (Chapter 12) reminds academicians of the dangers of reifying a tra- dition and then studying it only in terms of its own texts. Buddhist interpretations of Hinduism, she cites in illustration, belie the view of Hinduism as a tolerant religion and ultimately encourage us to rethink both traditions. Gregory Starrett (Chapter 11) provides a valuable overview of anthropological research on Islam while pointing out difficulties and important issues that face researchers in this tradition. Melinda Bollar Wagner describes the process by which ethnographers gain an understanding of a cul- ture, stage by stage, as they go into and come out of their fields of work (Chapter 2). She finds confirmation of her own attempt to "strike a balance" between scien- tific data gathering and humanistic understanding in her readers' reports that they cannot tell where she stands in relation to the groups she is studying. Michael Brown (Chapter 4) likewise seems to strive for balance when he observes that magic is a "sensibility," a midpoint between "the purely instrumental and the purely expressive," (130) rather than a failure of reason. To say that religion is a sensibility, a kind of intuition of the cosmos connatural to human beings and phenomenologically irreducible, would go a long way toward keeping the scientific study of the behavior from becoming the dismissal of it, or the avowal of, any particular one. The Age of Romanticism finally turned toward the existential and the phenomenological philosophers. In the place where I least expected it, an anthropologist appears who aspires to transcend the tired but "intractable" burden of the post-Cartesian world: the mind-body dualism. In Chapter 17, Laughlin far exceeds all others in the book in locating the philo- sophical grounds whereby ethnographers can "suspend disbelief' in doing fieldwork with religious practi- tioners, and yet remain scientific in their accounting of it. Laughlin is apparently able to appreciate the neural chemistry of religious experience as associative rather than exclusively causal. The religious practitioner's experience is likewise accorded careful appreciation as evidence of it unfolds before the eyes of the ethnogra- pher. Laughlin realizes that one must assert undue epistemological bias to do more than this. In the end, I was most satisfied with Glazier's Handbook. In revealing the state of the anthropology of religion as it is, warts and all, this volume offers some- thing to delight, and to offend, everyone. Any reader will learn something new from it while being chal- lenged to ponder the familiar in new ways. MARK GRUBER Saint Vincent CoUege Latrobe, Pennsylvania __~</page></plain_text>
