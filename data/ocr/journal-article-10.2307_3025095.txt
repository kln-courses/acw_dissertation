Adaptation in Nature of Everything to its Position in the World. In the universe, from the larva of the butterfly, through man, to the entire system of the universe, all is progress through successive stages of development. Progress through successive stages of development is the order (KoauoS) through which all things must of necessity move. The progress which I would speak of here, is not progress as usually understood, progress in a straight line, it is progress in a circle; starting from a point, it comes back to the same point again. In every species of development there is a culminating period, when every development reaches its highest point of perfection and fulness, which is manifested at the period of its existence by the beauty and perfection which the development attains to at that period. It is the inevitable law of all developments, the tendency of all things after having reached maturity, to decline and to decay. Man and nations, art and nature, are equally subject to this law. There is an expression used by a Greek philosopher, KicvK\Xo avayiKc. It is a law of necessity that all things move in a circle. It is the law of development that all things have a rise, progress, maturity, decline, and decay; all things moving through their cycle of progressive de- velopment. The different geological ages are but cycles of develop- ment; the various extinct fossil animals are evidences of beings run- * Hood's "Cruise of H.M.S. Fawn in 1862."

The seasons undergo their changes in cycles. The earth and planets move in circles ; the eclipses of the moon recur in a periodical cycle. By the precession of the equinoxes, the whole of the equator moves round that of the ecliptic, employing a period or cycle of no less than 25,868 years. According to Sir William Herschel, the sun itself, with the whole solar system, is performing a cycle, moving through space at the rate of 150 millions of miles a year. The history of nations and peoples is but a history of developments, each people having its cycle of development. As the laws which govern the planets in their course are modified by disturbing forces, so the laws of development are modified by climate, species, race, position in the world. There is a distinct and separate development for man considered as the individual man, for man in the aggregate as a people, for man considered as the human race. The development of the individual man rarely ever exceeds the limits of one hundred years; of man as a people, seldom exceeds one thousand. To the development of the human race we can affix no period of limitation; but, considering that the world is now almost entirely discovered and peopled, ancl that there is no spot on the earth where there is any likelihood of another people arising and developing itself into a great nation, we may say that the development of the human race has reached its culminating point, and is now on the wane. The great scheme of nature is a system of gradation and subordina- tion one to another. From the trilobite, which is the earliest form of life, to man, all is gradation from a lower to a higher and more perfeet form of organisation. In the laws of development there are no sudden leaps, each stage must form a stepping stone to the next stage. In the development of the laws of nature and science, each truth is the result of a former truth; each fact is a stepping-stone to the solution of another fact; each thought is the germ of another thought. There is a sequence in all things; one thing grows out of or is evolved from another. As it gives us a high idea of the skill and ingenuity of a watch- maker when he makes a watch which will go on for years without there being any further need of having recourse to his skill and inter? ference, so it ought to give us a lofty conception of a Deity, who has created a world whose system can proceed onwards by the govern? ment and development of his laws alone. And as it would prove want of skill and ingenuity in a watchmaker, who should make a watch which would frequently require his aid, so a constant interposition of</page><page sequence="3">THE HISTORY OF MAN. 175 the Deity in the affairs of the world would be presuming a want of skill and carelessness in the development of those laws which the Divine lawgiver has imposed on the universe. Development of Mind. The progress of the development of the human mind in different ages, climates, and circumstances, is uniform, acting upon the same principle and to the same end. Assuming that principle which is the essence of induction, the con? viction of the universal and permanent uniformity of nature, it follows as a necessary consequence that the actions of man in the aggregate, and the development of the phenomena of the human mind, must share the same laws of order, uniformity, and continuit}', which belong to all parts of the material world. As it is the nature of the human mind to be always uniform in its operations, always consistent in its results, it follows that, when em- ployed upon the same subjects, its results and conclusions are the same. As the Bishop of Natal beautifully expresses it, " The mind of man, in all ages and in all countries, musing on the origin of all things, has been led by a Divine instinct to the same grand conclu? sions." Human nature is one and the same everywhere; the same wants beget the same invention and use of the same necessities to supply those wants; the same ideas arise within the mind of man, suggested by the same objects. As in early childhood our natural instincts are more manifest, so in the earlier periods of human civilisation man's natural instincts are more fully developed. There is an instinct peculiar to the common nature of man, by which man and nations, at each stage of their development, work out independently certain ideas and suggestions peculiar to those stages of development. Man may undergo change of place, climate, and appearance; still the same development of mind takes place, subject to the laws that have operated through all ages. Comte points out three distinct stages of human development?the theological, the metaphysical, the positive. These coincicle with the stages of the development of mind in the individual man. In child? hood all phenomena are explained by authority, or referred to powers which it cannot comprehend. Youth begins to think for itself, and is led to discuss metaphysical entities. Manhood is obliged to acknow- ledge that all phenomena are subject to law. The suggestive principle is awakened by necessity in the mind of man, according as his wants and habits require. This suggestive principle, which is peculiar to our common nature,</page><page sequence="4">176 THOUGHTS AND FACTS CONTRIBUTING TO leads man to invent objects to supply his daily wants ancl require? ments; other objects and forms being suggested as his necessities increase and are more widely extended. Does man want to tear up the soil to prepare it for the reception of grain, he invents the plough. Does he want to cut down timber, or does he require the use of some sharp instrument, the hardness of flint and of metal, and their capa? bility to receive a fine edge, lead him to use those materials for that purpose, and suggests the form of a chisel, a hatchet, or a knife.*' Is he at war with his enemies, with the same materials he forms an arrow, and, to inflict greater injury on his enemy, the shape of a barbed arrow is suggested to him. The softness of clay, and the hardness it acquires when baked in the sun, suggests the idea of making cups, vases, and other utensils of that material, and leads him to invent the potter's wheel. His taste unfolding and the suggestive principle developing itself more ancl more, he shapes other forms, ancl acquires a taste for ornamentation to be applied to these utensils. In the early periods everything suggested was of the simplest form. In the early modes of sepulture the simplest forms were adopted, and were such as would be naturally suggested. The tumulus, which was one of the simplest forms, was adopted in several parts of the world. The cromlech, which is also another simple form, is found all over the world, and is not a characteristic form adopted by any separate people, or indicative of any particular race. The pyramid, too, is a form of sepulture found in countries the most widely apart?in Egypt, in Central America, and in Japan. Words and phrases expressive of similar ideas ancl usages are found in the early development of languages ancl peoples, which have their source in the nature of the human mind and of our sensations ; for the development of the human mind is evolved under much the same rela? tions in regard to external nature. Similar objects make similar im- pressions on the mind, which is one ancl the same everywhere. Dark- ness suggests the idea of death to the reflned Greek, as well as to the barbarous American. When the human mind reaches a certain period of development, certain ideas ancl facts, results of that stage of development, are necessarily evolved. We have an instance in the discovery of Nep- tune. The progress of astronomy hacl reached that stage when the discovery of Neptune as a part of the system of the universe could not but be evolved. Adams and Leverrier, working independently, were led to its discovery. In the progress of science, we also find Newton and Liebnitz developing further previously known scientific facts; discovering the doctrine of fluxions at nearly the same period. Many * Man, as Frankliu defines him, is a tool-making animal.</page><page sequence="5">THE HISTORY OF MAN. 177 ideas and facts in metaphysics and science have been anticipated by the Hindoos and Egyptians. This was the result of the earlier deve? lopment of these nations, they being many centuries in advance of European civilisation. The various myths, legends, fables, and other products of the human mind in different countries, seemingly identical, prove that the spontaneous tendencies of human thought and imagination are similar in all countries. They are the phenomena of the human mind, deve- loping themselves in accordance with laws peculiar to the human mind in its different stages of development. Among the mythological tales of Polynesia we find a great similarity to the fairy legends of Connaught. Nothing can afford a stronger evidence of the uniformity of the operations of instinct and of the suggestive principle in the mind of man, than the striking resemblance of the worked flints to each other in aimost every country where they have been found; they present identical forms, obviously the result of identical intention. The various kinds of aimost identical ornamentation found in widely apart nations without intercommunication, afford a remarkable evi? dence of independent evolution of the human mind, and self-develop- ment among nations. The simplest form of ornamentation, the zig- 2ag, is found wide spread among all nations. It is as naturally sug? gested to the savage in carving his club, as to the Greek artist in painting his vases, when the artistic instinct is awakened and deve? loped in man. As Humboldt remarks, nations of very different descent, when in a similar uncivilised state, having the same disposi? tion to simplify and generalise outlines, and being impelled by inhe? rent mental disposition to form rhythmical repetitions and series, may be led to produce similar signs ancl symbols. The cross, another form of ornamentation, is found in endless varieties in the most widely apart countries. It is also a form naturally suggested to man at any period of his development, for it is merely the intersection of two lines. In the paintings on Egyptian tombs, crosses, with other fancy devices, may be seen figured on the robes of the Rot-ri-n and the llebo, a people dwelling in the vicinity of Mesopotamia, showing, as Sir Gardner Wilkinson remarks, that this very simple device was already in use as early as the fifteenth century before the Christian era. Crosses in endless varieties are found on the Greek vases. Crosses, with other patterns, are figured on the tombs in Phrygia. The cross is also a distinctive sign in several Mexican hieroglyphs. It forms the central ornament of a tablet at the back of an altar at Palenque. Specimens of Peruvian pottery have also been discovered with a row of well-defined Maltese crosses. The fret is aimost uni-</page><page sequence="6">178 THOUGHTS AND FACTS CONTRIBUTING TO versal; it is found in China, in Greece, in Mexico, Central America, and Peru. The wave scroll and the so-called Vitruvian scroll are found figured on Peruvian pottery. Man being a creature of instincts, which are a part of his nature in every clime, and are universal, the same superstitious customs, which are the offspring of these instincts, will crop out in different countries. The belief in ghosts and the evil eye is universal. The same customs to avert the terrors of ghosts and of the evil eye are had recourse to in countries the most unconnected. The missionaries Huc and Gabet were astonished to find an extraordinary resemblance between Popery and Buddhism. In this there was nothing extraordinary, as the features of idol worship are the same in all countries. A coincid- ence of errors is the natural result of the unenlightened stage of man's development, and is as natural as to find similar imperfections, which " flesh is heir to", crop out in man, in nations, however widely apart. The human mind is continually repeating itself. We find a family likeness in all the mental manifestations of the human family. The same physiological phenomena appear generation after generation, century after century. All prophecies, oracles, witchcrafts, miracle- mongers, table-turnings, spirit rappings, are but manifestations of the same human mind in an abnormal or diseased physical condition, these phenomena recurring at certain stages of man's development. Development of Species and Race. Unity in typical structure and in one common nature, intellectual and physical, each species according to its distinct grade of development, is the connecting link between the diverse species of men. Unity in typical structure and physical development is not enough to constitute an unity, or to establish an identity of species. A dog and a man have many things in common with regard to their typical structure. They have eyes, nose, mouth, ears, legs. A dog has reasoning powers, imagination; it shows the same passions with man; it exhibits anger, jealousy, love, generosity, fidelity, is taught by experience; yet no one will say that a dog and a man are of the same species. The different expressions, unity of species, and oneness of the human species, seem to suggest different meanings. The unity of species would seem to imply that the entire human race was descended from one common stock; the oneness of the human species, that each species has many characteristics in common with the other species, and that they share the common instincts peculiar to the human race, and are endowed with a common typical structure, but still that each species has a separate and independent origin adapted to its position in the world, as in the lower animal creation several species share many instincts and distinct attributes in common, but still they are</page><page sequence="7">THE HISTORY OF MAN. 179 distinct and separate species, fitted and adapted to their position in the world. The expressions, however, are used indiscriminately. Unity nv the intellectual and social development in man is the con- necting link between the diverse races of men. In accordance with the great scheme of nature, which is a system of gradation, there must be a gradation of the races of mankind. In corroboration of which we quote the following : " The leading cha? racters of the various races of mankind are simply the representatives of particular stages in the development of the highest Caucasian type. The Negro exhibits permanently the imperfect brow, projecting lower jaw, and slender bent limbs of a Caucasian child some considerable time before the period of its birth. The aboriginal American repre- sents the same child nearer birth. The Mongolian, the same child newly born." Therefore, if each race is a representative of a lower or higher stage of development, it follows as a necessary consequence that there must be a gradation of races from a lower to a higher race. The relative position of each species of the human family must de- pend on its degree of development. Each species is the representa? tive of a stage of development forming a grade in the ascending scale. According to Humboldt, the inhabitants of New Holland and Van Diemen's Land appear to stand in the lowest grade of civilisation. Professor Owen considers the Andaman Islanders to be in the lowest grade. The degree of development any people can attain to depends on the species they belong to. The Malay, the Mongolian, the Negro, can reach a certain stage of development alone, and no further. As proofs of the development of peoples being arrested at a certain stage, we may quote the following. The Sandwich Islanders make progress in the early part of their education, and are so far apt and quick as children of civilised Europeans, but at this point they stop, and seem incapable of acquiring the higher branches of knowledge. Negro children also exhibit the same incapability of progress beyond a cer? tain stage. The great difference between man and man is in the greater or less perfection of his organisation. As there are gradcs of relative perfec- tion, from the Negro to the Caucasian, so there are grades of perfec? tion in the individuals of any separate nation or town, each differing according to the greater or less refinement of organisation. From the uniformity in the law of adaptation of everything in nature to its position in the world, it is evident that the Caucasian and the Negro must have a different origin and be separate races. For the Negro is by his physical constitution adapted to a warm climate, the Caucasian to a mild climate.</page><page sequence="8">180 THOUGHTS AND FACTS CONTRIBUTING TO Is there anything unreasonable in supposing that the same God who created endless varieties of species in the lower animal creation, and assigned them a region of the earth adapted to their physical con- stitution, from the infinitesimal infusoria to the gigantic elephant, could have also created separate ancl distinct species of men, fitted by their physical constitution to their position in the world ? Capability of improvement and power to attain to the highest and most perfect stage of development are the distinctive characteristics of the Caucasian race alone. Bunsen gives the following formula as a basis for some striking results respecting the universal history of man? kind : " The nations who speak the languages reducible to a common centre in High Asia, are the only tribes who hitherto have taken a place in the history of the world." When St. Paul announced to the assembled Athenians that " all nations are of one blood", it must be remembered that this was pro- claimed to the Caucasian race alone, and was meant to the Caucasian race alone as the only race then known. The Mongolian, the Malay, the American, were then unknown. The Negro was totally ignored. Race may be considered as a separate line of growth or develop? ment of one species, as the Saxon or Celtic races are distinct lines of growth of the Caucasian. In the opinion of Muller, " race" is de? rived, not from " radix", as was hitherto supposed, but from the old high German " reiza", line, lineage. It has been said by Waitz (p. 265) that we see one and the same people proceed from barbarism to civilisation, and again relapse from its high state, and its capacities decline ; but the cranial shape remains the same. This is the consequence of the law of development; in spite of cranial shape, peoples must have their rise, progress, maturity and decline ; the law of development must be fulfilled. The Greek cranial shape still remains, but the Greek people have run through their cycle of development. It is the same with the individual man ; however great may be his intellect, and however perfect the form of his head, the law of development must be fulfilled?he must pass through the stages of rise, maturity, and decline. Man in his earliest stage of development was equally naked, both as to body and mind. Like other animals, without experience of the past, without knowledge of the future, he wandered through wilds and forests, guided ancl governed purely by the affections of his nature. In the worcls of Horace, quoted by Sir Charles Lyell, "men in this stage were a dumb ancl filthy herd ; they fought for acorns and lurk- ing places with their nails and fists, then with clubs, and at last with arms, which, taught by experience, they had forged. Man on emerg- ing from this primitive barbarous stage became a nomadic hunter and</page><page sequence="9">THE HISTORY OF MAN. 181 fisher, unacquainted with every art but the imperfect one of fabricat- ing in a rude manner his arms and some household utensils, and of constructing and digging for himself an habitation, dependent on chance and the seasons for the means of satisfying his wants. In this stage the progress of man must have been extremely slow, as we still see evidences of it among the American Indians. As man ad- vances, becoming conscious of the sustenance afforded by the animals he has tamed, and which he has learned to preserve ancl multiply, he becomes a shepherd, but to a certain extent continues a nomad, wan- dering with his flocks wherever pasture or security invites. In the further progress of his development, when no longer content with the fruit and plants which chance throws in his way, he learns to form a stock of them, to collect them around him, to sow, to plant them, to favour their reproduction by the labour of culture, he becomes sta? tionary, and devotes himself to agriculture. The succeeding stage of his development is when, having acquired property in flocks, ancl in land which he has cleared and cultivated, and being anxious to secure quiet possession of what he had gained by his labour, conventions, tacit or expressed, were introduced into society, and became the rule of the actions of individuals, the measure of their claims, and the law of their reciprocal relations. Men experiencing the benefits derived from these, law and government were gradually evolved ancl deve? loped. Law ancl government once established, the progress of the development of man increased rapidly until it reached that mature state when it culminated in the periods of high civilisation in Egypt, in Babylon, Nineveh, India. Pickering remarks that it is a mistake to suppose that the pastoral or nomadic life is a stage in the progressive improvement of society. Pastoral life is as much a stage in the development of man, as chilcl- hood is a stage in the development of the individual man ; many indi? viduals, however, remain in a state of childhood all their life, but this is the result of an arrested development, and of course is an abnormal state. In those widely extended regions which Pickering mentions, where cultivation is impossible, all progress in development is neces? sarily checked. All species and races have their cycles of development. Like the dodo of the Mauritius ancl the apteryx of New Zealand, whose species are now extinct, many races of men have run through their cycle of development, and become extinct. Several races in Europe and in Asia, and several tribes in America, have died out, and have com? pletely passed away. Development of Nations. The history of nations ancl peoples is but a history of developments, each people having its cycle of develop-</page><page sequence="10">182 THOUGIITS AND FACTS CONTRTBUTING TO ment. Egypt, Babylon, Nineveh, having run through their cycle of development, other cycles take their course of development, in Greece and Rome; the same rise, progress, and decay is repeated in Italy. England and France are now in their cycles of development. The sequence of the several stages of development can be as plainly traced in nations as in the individual man. Egypt may be adduced as the rlrst instance of self-tuition and self- development in a nation; for we have no record that Egypt learnt anything from any other nation. Egypt had kings, princes, and a form of government; Egypt had developed the arts and sciences requi? site for the conception and execution of the stupendous monuments and works of art still extant, for many thousand years, when many of the surrounding countries were in a primitive and pastoral state. In India we see the course of progressive development more strongly exemplified; for India, locked in by the Indus and the Himalaya, laying far away and apart, where even the faintest echoes of Greece or Europe could never reach her, ran through its solitary cycle, and worked out its own development alone. India has a literature of poetry and phi? losophy which reaches back to the earliest times, older than Troy and the Iliad, older than the Pentateuch; there were Indian poets before Horner lisped his first song ; there were Indian thinkers and philoso? phers before Thales called water the ?/&gt;%?/ of all things. That nations work out their civilisation independently, and go through their stages of development without connection, is exem? plified also in the self-developed civilisation of Mexico and Peru, where the remains of cities, temples, and vast public works, erected by a people endowed with high intellectual acquirements, can be traced. There have been discovered a system of canals for irrigation, long mining galleries cut in the solid rock in search of tin, lead, and copper; pyramids not unlike those of Egypt; earthenware vases and cups; and manuscripts containing records of their history;?all tes- tifying to a high degree of scientific culture and practical skill. Their calendars also present evidences of native and local origin. Accord? ing to Mr. Fergusson, examples occur in Peru of every intermediate gradation in the style of masonry, precisely corresponding with the gradual progress of art in Latium, or any European country where the Cyclopean or Pelasgic style of building has been found. There is no nation, however barbarous, which does not develope the germs of civilisation. Among the South Sea Islanders, when dis? covered by Cook, the applied sciences, if we may use the term, were not entirely unknown. They had observed something of the motions of the heavenly bodies, and watched with interest their revolutions, in order to apply their knowledge to the division of time. They were not entirely</page><page sequence="11">THE HISTORY OF MAN. 183 deficient in the construction of instruments of husbandry, of war, and of music. Cut off from the influence of European civilisation, and deprived of intercourse with higher grades of mind, we still find the inherent principle of progression exhibiting itself, and the inventive and reasoning powers developed in the attempt to secure means of subsistence.* It is a remarkable fact, that nature in the earliest periods, or, as we may say, in its infanc)r, was more active than in its later years, and produced more gigantic efforts than now. Nations, also, in their earliest periods were more active, produced more wonderful works, and executed structures which outvie in magnitude the boldest efforts of modern genius ; as instances, we can mention the sculptured caves of Ellora, the Etruscan walls of Cortona and Fiesole, the Druidical circle of Stonehenge. When we recollect that these were the first efforts of the human race, made without pattern, designed without exemplar, com- menced and carried out without experience, they cannot but give us a high idea of the energy and intellectual powers of man in the youth- ful stage of his development. As Dr. Wilson observes, "there seems to be an epoch in the early history of man, when what may be styled the megalithic era of art developes itself under the utmost variety of circumstances. It is one of the most characteristic features pertain- ing to the development of human thought in the earliest stages of constructive skill." The age or degree of civilisation any nation has reached, may be inferred from the kinds of poetry, painting, architecture, that prevail at any certain time, which mark the stages of its development. Poetry seems to have taken its origin in a hymn of praise and thanks- giving to the Deity; this is its first stage; then comes the ballad or short mythic poem ; next the epic, which is a descriptive poem ; in another stage the lyric poem is evolved, which is the spontaneous over- flowof powerful feelings, accompanicd by music; next is the tragic poem, which combined a dramatic narrative with lyrical poetry; at a later period came the didactic; the satire argues a declining state of civilisation. The first attempts at painting were representations of animals, which were generally symbolical; then came rude represent? ations of man, which progressed in different stages to its highest per- fection. The same progress and stages of development are manifest in architecture, the styles and the ornaments varying according to the nation where it took its origin. * This view of the civilisation of Mexico, Peru, and the South Sea Islands, must be qualified by considering that the American race can attain to civilisation in a certain degree only, and can never reach the refined and intellectual civilisa? tion which can be attained by the Caucasian race alone.</page><page sequence="12">184 THOUGHTS AND FACTS CONTRIBUTING TO The metre used in the early poetry of nations is peculiar to its stage of development. We find the ballad measure of the early poetry of nations the most remote from one another almost similar. The ballad poems of Spain and Germany contain many Saturnian verses. Indeed, as Macaulay says, there cannot be a more perfect Saturnian line than one which is sung in every English nursery? 11 The queeu was in her parlour eating bread and honey". Yet the author of this line, we may be assured, borrowed nothing from either Naevius or Archilochus. History has been contemptuously called an old almanac. This is but too true; for as the moon, after having fulfilled its synodical period, comes round to the same point, its eclipses occurring in ex- actly the same order again, and an almanac of a past year can be used for the present year, so frequently the actions and events of past years are repeated, ancl history can teach us to follow the sequence and order of recurring events. We find an instance in the history of the French revolution. The sequence of events in the French revo- lution may be placed side by side with those of the English revolu? tion. The stages of the progress of intellectual development were almost similar in England and in France. In France, indeed, the development was later; but, as Buckle says, when the development had fairly begun, the antecedents of its success were among both peoples precisely the same. Development of Early Races. The similarity of the earlier produc- tions of art among different peoples is but the result of the suggestions and inspirations of an universal instinct peculiar to our common nature. Two useful instruments are found amongst early nations the most remote from one another, as the invention and suggestions of neces- sity, without being communicated from any other nation?the plough ancl the potter's wheel. The weapons, tools, instruments, ornamentation, pottery, of each stage of man's development, are almost similar in all countries. The flint implements of the gravel drift found in England, are almost similar to those found at Abbeville, ancl St. Acheul, in France. The stone implements of Denmark, Ireland, France, New Zealand, Mexico, Teneriffe, are almost identical. The pottery of this age is very much akin, the ornamentation on it being also very similar. The tools and weapons of the bronze period in Ireland, Denmark, Italy, America, bear a distinct analogy to one another. The settlements of the bronze period in Switzerland are marked by tools, ornaments, pottery, closely resembling those of the same age in Denmark.</page><page sequence="13">THE IlISTOItY OF MAN. 185 The flint axes found in the gravel drift are evidences of a still earlier development, than the 3tone period, of the suggestive principle in man. According to Mr. Evans, the flint weapons found in con? junction with elephant remains, imbedded in gravel, overlaid by sand and brick earth, present no analogy to the well known implements of the so-called Celtic or stone period. They have every appearance of having been fabricated by another race of men, and are on a much larger scale, as well as of ruder workmanship. They are thus evidences of a much earlier stage of development, and of an age of ruder strength, and of still more infantine skill; perhaps too, of an earlier species of a human-like race, a connecting link between the pithecoid and the human species, of which the Neanderthal skull may afford a specimen. In Mexico and Teneriffe, obsidian has been found in great quantities. Its presence has suggested its use for similar purposes. The Mexicans used obsidian for hatchets, similar to those used by the Gauls and the South Sea Islanders. It was also employed for knives, sword- blades, ete. In like manner, the Guanches (the ancient inhabitants of Teneriffe) fixed splinters of that mineral to the end of their lances. In both countries this variety of lava was employed as an object of ornament. Obsidian, jade, and Lydian stone are, Humboldt re? marks, three minerals, which nations ignorant of the use of copper or iron have in all ages employed for making keen-edged weapons. In studying the manners and customs of savage nations at the present day, and the instruments they use, we find a reflex of the habits and mode of life of our own rude ancestors, and a means of better comprehending the uses some instruments are applied to, and the solution of many things unexplained with regard to their habits and customs. In the early stages of the development of nations, uncultivated minds have rude tastes. Hence there is a remarkable resemblance in the taste for ornament in their early stage. The ornamentation and decorations which are the objects of their taste are aimost similar in the likeness they bear to one another and in their rudeness. In the earliest or barbarous stage we find a fondness for the zigzag meander fret, or such ornament as we find in the clubs of the South Sea Islanders, or in the very early Greek races. Similar designs adorn the common pottery at Maypure, on the banks of the Orinoco ; they ornament the bucklers of the Otaheitan ; the fishing implements of the Esquimaux, and the walls of the Mexican palace of Mitla; for there is a tendency in the mind of man in the infancy of nations to take a sensible pleasure in the symmetric repetition of the same forms, and an inclination to follow a rhythmic order in its rudest essays of vol. n.?NO. vi. o</page><page sequence="14">186 THOUGHTS AND FACTS CONTRTBUTING TO poetry and song, as well as in its earliest attempts at ornament. In the next stage, a taste is evolved for the rude representations of animals, as we see in the early sculptures of Nineveh, and in the Greek and Etruscan vases. In the development of the architecture of the middle ages there is a coincidence of tastes, another cycle of de? velopment beginning its course. In the early period we find the same zigzag moulding, and later the same taste for the rude representations of animals. In several ancient countries we find reminiscences of an earlier race, which seem to have been the primitive agricultural inhabitants of the soil, such as the Aryans in Asia, the Pelasgi in Greece, the Toltecs in Mexico. According to Muller, the Aryans, who were the ancestors of the Indians and Persians, who spoke a language not yet Sanscrit or Greek, but which contained the germs of all, led the life of agricultural nomads. They knew the art of ploughing. They had domesticated the most important animals?the cow, the horse, the sheep, the dog; they were acquainted with the useful metals. The etymological signification of Arya, he adds, seems to be " one who ploughs or tills." The Pelasgi, the aboriginal race in Greece, were famous for their agricultural skill. The Latin words which are expressive of the events or simple relations of a pastoral, agricultural people, such as pater, mater, aratrum, bos, ager, can only be ascribed to the Pelasgic colonisers of Italy. With regard to the Toltecs, Prescott writes that they were instructed in agriculture, and in many of the most useful mechanic arts. In the early periods of Peru, Manco Capac, the Child of the Sun, entered upon his beneficent mis? sion among the rude inhabitants of the country by teaching the men the arts of agriculture. Tacitus also describes the ancient Germans as agricultural nomads. The lake habitations, or, as they are called in Ireland, crannoges, used by the primitive races of men in their early stage of develop? ment, are evidences of man under similar circumstances having re? course to similar expedients. The necessity of security, among the early savage peoples, suggested to man in that state of warfare the expedient of forming his abode or dwelling in lakes at some distance from the shore, thus obtaining security and freedom from attack. These are founcl among peoples widely apart; they were constructed by a Thracian tribe dwelling in Prasias, a small mountain lake of Pceonia, as described by Herodotus. They are found in Switzerland, in Ireland, and among the Papoos of New Guinea. The Swiss lake dwellings are, as Mr. Rawlinson remarks, the work of a race who formed for themselves habitations almost exactly like those which Herodotus describes.</page><page sequence="15">THE HISTORY OF MAN. 187 The so-called raths in different parts of Ireland were, like the enclosures by the Indian tribes, formed for similar purposes of seeurity, and for stores for grain in the early ages in pastoral countries. The so-called raths are always found in wide pasture grounds. Development of Language. Language is the result of progressive development, originating in the attempts of man to express his wants by articulating sounds suggestive of the thing signified. Lan? guage, in its earliest stage of development, was monosyllabic, such as used by the Chinese, and is a form into which human discourse naturally, and as it were spontaneously throws itself. Language in its more complete and grammatical form, or the relation of intelligible sounds to one another, is the result of mind in a more advanced stage of man's development. Language, like other developments of instinct and reason peculiar to man, is evolved independently by the divers races of man. The monosyllabic is the child stage of the development of lan? guage. The Chinese is the child language of the human race. The stages of the progressive development of language are the radical, the agglutinative, and inflectional. Some nations, however, have adhered to, and still retain their language in its earlier stage of development. The Chinese and the Turanians have rigidly retained each their lan? guage in its earlier stage; its normal progress of development was thus arrested. The Chinese language is still in the radical stage, the Turanian in the agglutinative. The inflectional stage, as among the Aryans, is, it is evident, the most perfect stage of the develojnnent of language. To reach this perfect stage, language must pass through the earlier stages of radical and agglutinative; as Muller remarks, we cannot resist the conclusion that what is now inflectional, was formerly agglutinative, and what is now agglutinative was at first radical. The instinctive utterances of man in his earliest stage of develop? ment, when attempting to give articulate expression to his thoughts and feelings, form the primitive roots and germs of language; for in? stance, the root "pa," to feed, is one of those instinctive utterances from which many words may be developed. As a further instance of instinc? tive utterances, forming the same roots in nearly all languages, we may give the words "po" (father) and "me" (mother), in Siamese. As Sir John Bowring remarks, these two sounds, or something approaching them, being the first lispings of infancy, may be found indicating the parental relations in almost every language of the world. The root " ar," which means to plough, to open the soil, is another instance of instinctive utterance forming the germ of many words. The so-called Aryan roots are nothing but the first instinctive utterances of man in the earliest stage of his development, and are con- o 2</page><page sequence="16">188 THOUGHTS AND FACTS CONTEIBUTING TO sequently the germs of language in all countries. The similar con- struction of remote languages is the result of the laws of the human mind, which are similarly developed in man, dwelling however widely apart, and by which, in the process of the construction of language, similar words and forms are independently evolved. For example, a savage owning a horse, to which he gives a name, forms a nomina- tive case. Considering himself as owner of a horse, he forms a geni- tive case. Wishing to give something to eat to his horse, he forms a dative case. Announcing himself as owner of a horse, he says, " I have a horse"; thus he forms an accusative case. A verb may be evolved in a similar manner. Language has its stages of development, its progress, maturity, decline, and extinction. Bunsen remarks that?"We shall take it for granted as a general principle, flowing from a very simple and therefore universal law, that the substantial or particle language is the most ancient possible, and that the relative position and succes- sion of the other languages will have to be made dependent upon its degree of development. The less developed language will have branched off from the original stock at an earlier period than that which presents a higher degree of development. This forms the ascending line of development. When the language has arrived at its culminating point as to its forms, the descending line will begin, which is a gradual decay of those forms. The languages of the emi- grating tribes, if we possess early documents, will show us the state of development of which they are as it were the deposit, and which decide the place they are to occupy in the general scale." Each branch of language represents the stage of development lan? guage has reached. The Chinese or monosyllabic, the Turanian or agglutinative, the Aryan or inflectional, represent the stages of deve? lopment of the Indo-European branch in the ascending scale. In the opinion of Bunsen, the Chamitic, the Chaldee, the Hebrew, are the representatives of the stages of the development of the Semitic branch of language. According to Muller, the Tungusic, the Mongolian, and the Turkic are the stages of development in the ascending scale of the Turanian languages. An important indication of the stage of development a nation has reached is the form of its language, or its modes of expressing words and ideas. The radical form of language as among the Chinese, and the agglutinative as among the Turanians, are proofs of early stages of development. The picture writing of Mexico is an evidence of the Mexican nation being in an early stage of development. That the varieties of language are the result of the independent de-</page><page sequence="17">THE HISTORY OF MAN. 189 velopment of speech in man, we have the confirmatory opinion of Agassiz: his words are?"As for languages, their common structure, and even the analogy in the sounds of different languages, far from indicating a derivation one from another, seem to us rather the neces? sary result of that similarity in the organs of speech which causes them naturally to produce the same sound. Who would now deny that it is as natural for men to speak as it is for a dog to bark, for an ass to bray, for a lion to roar, for a wolf to howl, when we see that no nations are so barbarous, so deprived of all human character, as to be unable to express in language their desires, their fears, their hopes? That there is an instinct or instinctive principle common to the human mind which teaches man to work out languages independently, we may quote a passage from Dr. Wilson, which is to the purpose. " By inflections as truly regulated by the science of grammatical laws as the language in which Plato wrote and Pindar sung, the wild unlettered Indian modifies each root-word or complex word sentence so as to express number, time, quality, or passions, as if guided by an intellectual instinct operating upon the reasoning faculty common to man." Development of Religion. In religion, Fetichism is the lowest and earliest stage of its development. Fetichism is still found among the negroes, where supernatural powers are attributed to inanimate objects, In a further stage, man, experiencing the influence and mastery of the elements ancl the physical powers of nature over his actions, and feeling his weakness and incapability to resist their agencies, was led to propitiate and worship them. Then follows polytheism, when mankind, endowing these powers ancl influences with thoughts, feel? ings, ancl shape like his own, ancl attributing to them a will to do good and evil, was led to worship them as superior beings, and by saerifices to them to obtain their good will and to avert their anger. Hero worship was also a development of this stage. In a later stage monotheism was evolved, attributing all might ancl creative power to one superior anthropomorphic being, such as the Brahma of India, the Osiris of Egypt, the Jehovah of the Jews, the Zeus of the Greeks. Its development proceeded onward, until it culminated in the sublime idea evolved by the Grecian mind of the Deity being the infinite in? telligence {vovs) pervading ancl ruling all things. In the earliest stage of the development of man, adoration of the sun was an aimost universal worship. Its representative, fire, also shared a similar extent of worship. Man, receiving his greatest blessings from the sun, showed his gratitude by the universality of the worship of that luminary. The proudest title assumed by the Pharaohs of Egypt and the Incas of Peru was " offspring of the sun."</page><page sequence="18">190 THOUGHTS AND FACTS CONTRIBUTING TO Fire is the great civiliser. When man learnt to produce fire, he made a great step in his development; from its usefulness and from the benefits derived from it, man in gratitude worshipped it. For the same reason, gratitude for the benefits derived from them, rivers and fountains have been worshipped. The Indian worships the Ganges, the Egyptian worshipped the Nile. Fountains and wells are objects of veneration in many countries. These and other modes of worship are grounded in the instincts of mankind, and are evolved in accordance with the stages of man's intellectual development. In the earlier ages of nations no adequate idea of God is developed but such as would be formed by a child. In the writings of Horner, and the earliest writings of ancient nations, we find no adequate con? ception of the divine nature but what we see in the case of children, diversified here and there by some happy surmise or solitary flash of truth. A purer conception of the Deity was formed in a later stage of development. Anaxagoras was the first among the Greeks who recognised the existence of a supreme intelligence directing and governing all things. The mythology of various nations is nothing but the embodiment or giving human form and shape to the various physical agencies of nature. Such ideas seem to have arisen within the minds of, and have been suggested to, the people of various nations in their primi? tive state, this of course more or less modified by circumstances, such as the land they live in, the climate, the temperament. The mythical origin of mythology would seem to be of later origin than the elementary. The mythical is but the poetical embellishment of the elementary. The mythical is the youth, the elementary, the childhood of the religious development of a nation. The law of adaptation of every thing to its position in the world, is not only evident in the adaptation of the camel to the desert, the whale and the walrus to the northern ocean, but we may also adduce, as a wonderful instance of adaptation in nature, the eyeless fish (Amblyop&gt;sis pellucida) in the mammoth cave of Kentucky. Its eyes are covered by an opaque skin, or are entirely absent. The natural conclusion is, that, from the dark and gloomy habitat of this singular fish, the power of vision being unnecessary, nature, which adapts every living creature to the mode of life assigned to it, has withheld a faculty which would serve no purpose in the economy of its being. The appearance of eyes is preserved in obedience to the law of uni? formity in nature, as paps are in man.</page><page sequence="19">THE HISTORY OF MAN. 191 STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.</page></plain_text>
