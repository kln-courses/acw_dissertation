<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religion in Liberal Education BY ERNEST J. CHAVE in the average college or university, students and faculty might be classified under the following categories relative to their religious beliefs, atti tudes, and habits: 1. Conformists to traditional sectarian patterns. 2. Casual and indifferent. 3. Skeptical, cynical, or hostile. 4. Intellectually liberal, interested in history and psychology of religion. 5. Religiously sensitive, appreciative of spirit ual values generally. 6. Committed to religious causes, concerned with putting ideals into action. The categories are not exclusive but they may serve to direct attention to types of religious be havior or disposition which need to be kept in mind as one considers the kind of religious pro gram which may function adequately on a cam pus. One cannot assume that a list of courses inviting free inquiry and creative thought will appeal to any large proportion of the students, even if suitable faculty could be secured. Only a small percentage of men or women seem to enjoy radical thinking in any field, and perhaps a smaller number are ready to trust their own judgments. Most people are sztis?ed to drift along, merely rationalizing mores to which they have become accustomed. A few are negative, for different reasons, and show their emotional disturbances by hostile criticisms, mockery, or some irrational conduct. There are always some who are not content without action and these are the cru saders for social causes, organizers and joiners, with various degrees of discriminatory understand ing of what they do or should do. Some are mysti cal, contemplative, spiritually sensitive, refined in mind and emotional responses, but with widely differing appreciative consciousness and manner of response. Even conformists vary in their con formity. Probably there is no normative way of being religious. What then shall we do with religion in a liberal educational situation? Shall we provide a rich, stimulating educational opportunity in varied course offerings, well-planned chapel services, and a good range of informal activities and organiza tions, and then administratively at least adopt a laissez-faire attitude? Is there any need for ap praising what goes on, or of trying to integrate religious factors into the total educational pro gram? Is religion to be treated as an intangible variant beyond control or direction, only inviting trouble when subjected to rational educational procedures? In a recent symposium on religion in higher education1 one definite tendency is to avoid any treatment of religion which may arouse controversy. Analytical and descriptive studies are accepted as being in order but one should be cautious in evaluation, and be careful not to arouse any emotional interest or attitudes. In fact one professor boasts that he can deal with religious topics so dispassionately that his pupils will not know whether he is a Catholic or Protestant. Per haps education has no responsibility for helping young people to shape a life philosophy, to feel 1 Symposium edited by E. W. Blakeman, University of Michigan, in Religious Education, March-April 1947. 301</page><page sequence="2">302 The Journal of General Education differences in life investments, and to prepare themselves for effective functioning in a modern world. Perhaps graduates should be sophisticated neutrals without convictions, purposes, or sense of personal-social obligations. Though there is considerable skepticism and cynicism in academic circles regarding education for realization of spiritual values, the writer feels that there is a growing intelligent and appreciative attitude toward possibilities in this field of human development. Many books and articles, confer ences and discussions, in general education are giving attention to spiritual factors,2 to evalu ation of ends and means with respect for personal social enrichment and growth, to the integration of life around basic meanings and goals. Tradi tional religious programs are being re-examined; old assumptions are being questioned; sectarian forms are being transcended; and a pervasive, transforming spirit of religion is in the ascendant. Investigation, exploration, and experimentation are the order of the day. Religion is coming to be thought of as an important, integral part of culture, and a vital element in education. Before we consider proposals for a constructive program of religion in higher education let us briefly review some of the conditions in religion which confront educators who dream of a new day. These conditions are discouraging but per haps no more so than many of the socio-economic conditions which education is slowly changing. The religious picture is not what it should be but it is not by any means a hopeless situation. While shortcomings may be lamented there are clearer visions of what spiritual attainments may be, and how they may be realized, than any "revelation" ever set forth. Insights are deepening, values are expanding, and natural forces and resources prom ise more than supernatural powers were ever asked to perform. Perhaps we should not play on words too much, for it is impossible to know what verbal symbols 2 See publications of the Educational Policies Commission, the John Dewey Society, the American Council on Educa tion, and other individuals and organizations. may include in their varied meanings. To many educated people the word natural is far more com prehensive than the term supernatural, for the former implies an infinite universe, with intricate processes operating in time and space, so extensive that science and mathematics can only suggest possible boundaries. The old supernatural realm and activity seems but a childish fantasy along side the wonders and mysteries of the unfolding natural world. The religionist often seems to speak as if he alone lived with a cosmic consciousness, but can any educated man or woman do less? If a religionist speaks of God, does he go beyond the processes which the scientist explores? Is his sym bol referring to a Power, a Cause, an integrating Value in the universe, for the reality of which the scientist can find no evidence? Has this religionist an intuitive sense that escapes the psychologist* the philosopher, the educationalist? The history and psychology of religion have done much to help us understand the different beliefs and prac tices, and to see the relation of what is called religion to human experiences subsumed under secular names. The fact to be kept in mincj/ is that whatever one thinks, feels, values, or does in one situation is affected by what has happened in other adjustments. There is an organic and psychic unity to all experience. Further, what a na?ve* primitive mind conceives is due to the limitations of sensitivity and meaning which that individual has, and what he describes may be relative to the same general ^situation that a critical educated person discusses in much different terms. The supernaturalist and the naturalist live in the s^me world, but they see and feel it differently and picture it to themselves in quite contrasting forms. One person thinks in terms of direct action of an anthropomorphic deity and another in relation to complex processes of consistent and continuous operations. A philosopher and a theologian may speak and think in abstract language, but most of the common people use concrete imagery, and specific impressions, with few generalized concepts born of critical thought. In all that is said and done under the name of religion we must inter</page><page sequence="3">Religion in Liberal Education 303 pr?t it in relation to the thought and value struc ture of the individual or group involved. Some of the conditions referred to above which confront an educator include the following types of problems. In the "One World" which the United Nations organizations are trying to unify we find that religion seems to present an extreme ly bad set of relationships. The people of the world are organized under many diverse religious organizations, with beliefs and customs in contin ual conflict. The Christian groups have little harmony among themselves, and yet they assume a superiority to the older ethnic faiths. Only a few attempts have been made to get leaders of different religious bodies to confer together, and few writings have sought to bring common under standing or cooperation on any issues. Yet in the United Nations discussions, spiritual interests are as much considered as material. In fact they seem to be supreme at times in the recognition that unless justice prevails, and a higher basis in inter national relations is achieved, devastating wars will inevitably follow. Scientists, radio commen tators, statesmen, editors, speakers and writers of many varied backgrounds are all making contri butions to a world fellowship, and stressing spirit ual values, without any sense of dependence upon statements of organized religion. Again in Amer ica, with its two hundred and fifty sectarian divi sions, we find causes and well-developed move ments which represent spiritual outreaches for better living conditions and nobler personal-social standards, that seem to have little if any relation to any sectarian origin. Religion is a pervasive quality of all life and should not be limited to ecclesiastical customs and stereotyped credal state ments. Theological speculations multiply even in a scientific age, and fine-spun theories are taught as absolute doctrines. Through methods of indoc trination, children develop concepts and attitudes that as adults they find difficulty in treating objectively. Fundamentalists, conservatives, and liberals emotionally defend ideas and formulae for which they frequently have little rational support. Concepts which ought to evoke cooperative think ing and large tolerance for differences of opinion often are the occasion for bitter antipathies. Preachers and teachers reach far back into a dim past to find illustrations of what are called divine manifestations, Christian virtues, and exemplary conduct. Seldom do they use the living present, or the story of history, as a basis for a vital faith and incentive to religious living. The Jesus of history and the Christ of theology are hopelessly confused so that no clear figure is appreciated and no right understanding of life and teaching is possible. In some circles authority for belief and conduct rests in an infallible Pope; in others a church assumes the role of interpreter and law maker; again the Bible becomes the source of norms, meanings being read into or out of its pages to sanction custom and creed; and still oth ers look to science, pragmatism, or experience as their basic support. When one hears a demand for more religion in education one asks "What kind of religion?" What objectives should we have in giving religion a more central place in educa tion? Is there a hope that a study of religion, or sharing in religious activities may make young people religious? If so what do we mean by "religious?" In a recent book the writer has described ten basic types of religious experience, taking a func tional view of religion.3 The purpose is to separ ate the developing characteristics of refined reli gion from the multitude of confusing forms in which it is found. The categories chosen to iden tify these functional factors are stated in a way that makes it possible to recognize degrees of at tainment in growing persons, to appreciate varia tions of achievement in different relationships, and to make plain the conditioning influences on their fulfillment. They have been used as a convenient diagnostic means of evaluating the religious life of an institution. The ten categories are briefly stated, and then illustrations are given of what they mean, or might mean in a college or univer sity situation. It is hoped that this short-analyti 3 A Functional Approach to Religious Education, Uni versity of Chicago Press, 1947.</page><page sequence="4">304 The Journal of General Education cal statement may suggest the larger import of this view of religion. The order of presentation of the ten areas of experience is not important, and there is no claim to comprehensiveness or finality in the analysis. The headings are con venient classifications of types of what are com monly recognized as functional expressions of re ligion. They have been validated in many groups of conservatives and liberals, Protestants, Catho lics, and Jews, and are accepted as identifiable characteristics of religion. The list is as follows: sense of worth, social sensitivity, appreciation of the universe, discrimination of values, responsibili ty and accountability, cooperative fellowship, quest for truth and realization of values, integration of experience into a working philosophy, sense of historical continuity, and group celebration. By sense of worth we mean growing appreci ation of the spiritual possibilities of human life with desire to realize fullness of personal-social capacities. It involves self-respect, worthy ambi tions, and purposeful living. It is the exercise of intelligence, refined emotions, controlled powers, a widening of the gap between human achieve ments and the blind level of animar or mechan istic behavior. On the college campus we find many forces stimulating the growth of this spirit ual quality but there are always depressing and degrading influences which have to be met and conquered. To the degree that institutions of higher education consider individuals and respect personality, religious values are dominant; but to the degree that persons are lost sight of in crowd ed classes, examination tests, content-centered curricula, inadequate housing, exclusive cliques, and other inhuman practices, there is a hard strug gle to attain and maintain sense of worth. Faculty members who have time and interest for people, wise and sympathetic counselors, friendly folks in administrative and routine affairs, all have an affect on the growth of this quality. Some stu dents are badly handicapped when they come to college, and are apologetic for trying to get a place in the sun. Others come with a confident sense of worth and can meet difficulties successfully. Some are awakened to possibilities they never knew in themselves; some are humbled and get a true sense of worth without being debased; some seem frustrated at every turn, never experiencing the thrill of making good. While everyone must find and prove his own worth, both physical and social environment make a difference. There is need for many concrete stimuli to worthful liv ing ? social recognition for conduct that is above the average, expectation of refinement, challenge to worthy citizenship, high standards for academic work, respect by those who are respected. The meaning of spiritual worth must be made explicit and attractive in the classroom as well as in the chapel, by an athletic coach as well as by a pro fessional counselor, in the atmosphere of the cam pus as well as in its published statements. Social sensitivity is a twin and inseparable qual ity, for he who has a true sense of his own worth, and his need for self-realization, will never pur posely handicap another. To love one's neighbor as oneself is a very old religious principle. To help another person to find himself, to release and stim ulate growth in another personality, to appreciate latent human goodness and to bring it into flower, are experiences which work for twofold growth. Sometimes competition, arbitrary demands, social exclusion, inferiority feelings, or other factors make it difficult to be socially sensitive and to live by the Golden Rule. To the degree that a demo cratic spirit prevails on a campus in administra tion, in the classroom, in dormitory life, in ath letics, in opportunities for free discussions, and in general respect for worth when it is shown, social sensitivity will grow; for the soil is good and the climate is right. Exhortation to be consid erate of others, to be kind and loving toward all, does not accomplish much; but in the give and take of campus life where social relationships are considered as of equal importance with studies, the spirit of mutuality and good will is likely to develop favorably. Students who feel the pressure of studies so great that they have to live in a library and always be getting ready for an exam ination, may miss the essential training in social</page><page sequence="5">Religion in Liberal Education 305 adjustment. Snack bars, dances, debates, campus organizations, all kinds of social situations pro vide opportunities for conversation, development of mutual interests, and appreciation of others. But it must be remembered in this quality, as well as in the other nine, attitudes and actions are always affected by precollege experiences and by continuing influences of homes and friends. What ever is done by students to each other, by faculty to students in courteous personal relations, by counselors or occasional speakers in efforts to raise standards of social behavior, growth is a slow and uneven process. Personalities big enough to think of themselves and others at the same time are the products of many stretching exercises and gradual maturation. Appreciation of the universe means living with cosmic perspective, thinking in universal terms, understanding and profiting by the laws and re sources of life's dependable processes. One may use the symbol God, or divine, to recall the creative, integrating, stabilizing forces of the world in which he lives, moves, and has his being, or he may use scientific terms. But the religious attitude is expressed in the way one organizes his life in relation to these stimulating and sustaining forces, not by the way one speaks of the deity. It is much easier to become fluent in use of theo logical language, and conventional religious lan guage, than to deal realistically with the laws and conditions governing human growth. Students need to feel that science, history, literature, art, and all fields of learning, may contribute toward one's appreciation of the universe, and to one's ability to take a significant place in it. Science may rule out prescientific supernatural views of religion, but it should make intelligent people conscious of the powers and resources inherent in the nature of the universe on which they are dependent. History in its varied branches should indicate the lines of most profitable procedure, and reveal some of the secrets of progress. Mod ern philosophy in the light of the testing and retes ting of general principles should give a strong working basis for good living. Instead of religion's being thought of as the fluent dicta of any preach er or teacher, using stereotyped formulae, surely on a college campus there should be larger respect for integrative principles based upon the critical studies of all fields of knowledge. Here, too, one might possibly find appreciation for processes that yet are not reducible to mathematical equations, and perchance for the marvels which have order that a mathematician can describe. There is beauty, wonder, poetry, music, human feeling, that neither words nor art forms can more than suggest. Some courses and extracurricular pro grams might give opportunities for deepening and refining emotional experiences, for creative ex pression, for enrichment of life with more than facts. Whatever is done in conventional services of churches or college chapel, or in informal re ligious groups, to give meaning to man's place in the unfolding scheme of the universe, there should be an underlying recognition among stu dents and faculty that the basic purpose of higher education is to gain such knowledge of the proc esses of the world in which we live that we can live fully and satisfyingly. Every graduate should have a broad horizon, a worthy set of objectives, and a faith that there are adequate resources for the upward climb. His life should reflect a sense of great dimensions in a vast but orderly universe. Discrimination in values and readiness to sacri fice lesser things for greater, are the marks of a maturing personality. By college age one should have felt the plural possibilities of life, and the necessity for the constant exercise of intelligent choice. No one needs to be a mere victim of environment or habit. It is easy to make excuses for a low level of conduct, but there is no reason for looking to some supernatural conversion, or second birth, to give one a new lease on life and a higher attainment. There are always alternative ways of behaving, and if one is to achieve a wor thy personality he must choose, discipline himself, and make good without making excuses. Psychol ogy and sociology reveal the secrets of personal and social spiritual progress as well in studies of current life as in the studies of the scriptures. It</page><page sequence="6">306 The Journal of General Education is not in knowing what Moses or Jesus said or did that is vital to religious living, but learning to weigh up values, to act in the light of careful judgments, and to build up adequate resources for worthy conduct. In college, students should have freedom to make choices, with more expectation than restriction influencing their behavior. They should learn to organize their time, conserve their energies, and distribute their interests, so that they have a maximum of satisfaction out of their var ied activities. In every hour of each day choices are made and spiritual growth is tested ? in a careless or disciplined attitude toward studies, in use of vulgar or refined language, in respectful or unworthy relations with the opposite sex, in selec tion of trashy or stimulating reading, in selfish indulgences or altruistic service. One may give lip service to discrimination, refinement, sacrifice, and idealism, or one may steadily push uphill and get satisfaction out of making the grade. Responsibility and accountability are closely related to the foregoing quality, for they involve the use of freedom. Religion emphasizes the fact that no one can be a law unto himself, that if he is to enjoy freedom he must recognize his obligations to his fellow man and to the larger order of developing life to which he belongs. Man belongs to an interdependent society of persons, and to a universe in which the organic whole is bound together by mutually related parts. One must learn to be trustworthy, and dependable in carrying out all social duties, but responsibility as a spiritual attitude means far more. One must feel his responsibility toward others, in his example and in his influence. The New Testament indict ment of a person "who causeth another to stum ble" is an emphatic statement of this principle. An educated man or woman should be able to assume leadership, to initiate needed changes, to set standards of conduct. The obligation of priv ilege applies again both to individuals and to groups and nations. The ability of the United Nations to function depends upon the willingness of the people of the United States, as well as people of other countries, to accept responsibilities according to resources. College young people need to grapple with the spiritual problems of living at peace with other nations, and also of promoting the democratic way of life as the way of largest freedom for growth of persons. Perhaps a class in political science might awaken a spiritual sense on a broader scale than many sermons. Society waits for educated men and women who will accept the responsibilities of good citizenship. Tn a survey of one large university recently, less than one quarter of the graduates belonged to organizations working for civic betterment, or to those working for any significant social cause. How could a university stimulate and guide this spirit of social responsibility? The next five norms of campus religious life must be dealt with more briefly, but any reader may expand the meanings for himself. Our func tional analysis might be extended to any degree in a review of typical situations and relationships. Cooperative fellowship is a conception of re ligion in relation to group life. It is concerned with the development of homes, schools, churches, businesses, government, and the many other agen cies which operate in modern society. No individ ual can realize the fullness of spiritual life unless the groups to which he belongs are such that respect for personality is the major interest. Christianity has pictured an ideal community and social order as the kingdom of God. For any group to function at its maximum every member must identify himself with the group and seek interests of common concern. Some students are parasites wherever they go. They take what they can and with little gratitude, and they give as little as they are compelled to do. They may have begun the habit at home and they expect others to provide for them without mutual return. Some are able to fellowship with certain people, but not with others. These are hardly big enough persons to have a rich sense of fellowship with people who are different in race, class, nationality, talent, or other characteristic, but whose person alities are most interesting when given release in a significant project. People frequently find</page><page sequence="7">Religion in Liberal Education 307 themselves and discover latent capacities in others, developing true spiritual fellowship, when they tackle difficult tasks together for some urgent human need. Conventional religious groups should have a fellowship of like-minded people, but sometimes a higher spiritual tone may be reached in a group not labeled religious than in one of orthodox pattern. Quest for truth and realization of values is set over against the common presentation of Christian truths, or those of any other faith, as dogmas, authoritarian creeds, the revealed word of God, or some such absolute. The educated man or woman refuses to accept uncritical traditions, dislikes attempts to solve problems by resort to authority, and expects to get his understanding of religion as of every other phase of life by experi ence and growing insight. He doesn't look for supernatural change but studies the laws of the world he lives in and tries to work creatively in a process that respects his worth. Religion for him is a growing insight into the problems and perplexities of life, and an increasing ability to attain desired ends. Integration of experiences into a working philosophy of life is a frank recognition that life presents conflicting and confusing experiences of good and evil which challenge the deepest thought of mature minds. Suffering, death, tragedies, dis illusionments, responsibilities, crises, fears, trou bles of all kinds stimulate reflection. What does life offer? What are the basic principles under girding satisfying living? Shall we meet our prob lems, frustrations, and limitations stoically, with resignation and hopelessness, or is there evidence of something more meaningful and hopeful? The religions of the world, and of the centuries, tell us of conclusions people have reached in the past. Today we review these old working philosophies and add growing insights from any source we can, and formulate new theories for ourselves. The college student is trained to face all the facts when he formulates a theory in the physical or social sciences, and he should do the same in re spect to religious theories. He cannot take the old sentimental song and echo its refrain, "God's in his heaven. All's right with the world." He knows that all is not right with the world, and he has very vague ideas of both God and heaven. One must develop a working set of norms and principles, experiment, and repeatedly revise them as experience and shared insights warrant. Sense of historical continuity is the assurance that we belong to an ancient and honored body of seekers after truth and righteousness. We re evaluate the ideas and values of those who have gone before us, but we could not possibly do as well as we do today in our increasingly complex society if we did not have the wisdom of the past to guide us. Sometimes religious people think of the Bible as the sole treasure from the past with spiritual wisdom, and it is exalted as the one unique revelation of the one God and Father of all mankind. Educated people question that claim today, believing it to be an inadequate view of God, man, and the way of life. The many varied ideas of God in all faiths, in the past and today, and the many different interpretations of a divine way, are but indications of man's continued quest for the ultimates. The Bible is a valuable heri tage, but continuity with the questers of the cen turies gives us a much larger resource than the older generations had. We have the records of his tory, scientific research, literature, art, philosophy, and organized religion, all of which give us data valuable for understanding the nature of the world and of man. Especially we should be thankful for the stories that have been preserved for us of the few men in each generation who have risen above the average in nobility of life and clarity of vision. Group celebrations are manifestations of the overflowing spirit. Religion is a social experience as well as a personal one. It grows by exchange of ideas, by contagion of spirit, by participation in group mores, by association with familiar sym bols and customs. People have always had times, places, and ceremonies to focus attention on pri mary goals and values, to stimulate group-minded ness, and to renew consecration to causes. There is need for meditation, for getting perspective,</page><page sequence="8">308_The Journal of General Education for redefining purposes, for recalling resources. In college, Sundays are frequently times for loaf ing or catching up work, and church holy days are mostly holidays. Stereotyped services to com memorate these events do not appeal to most educated people, and neither time nor ingenuity are used to make them meaningful. Worship practices, including communion or mass, are com monly gestures rather than times of reflection and dedication. On high days in the educational cal endar such as athletic events, homecoming of alumni, Founder's Day, Commencement or Con vocation, there are occasions for exalting the cen tral human values and worthy achievements; but often the celebrations are superficial and boring. There is need for better use of drama, pageantry, music, conferences, exhibits, and other means of arousing interest and concern for something sig nificant. This kind of celebration requires thought and planning, and probably more value comes from the preparation to those who participate, than in the final event to those who merely are spectators. But we cannot expand this further. It is the cumulative experiences of the total college or university life that count in spiritual development. One person finds help in one situation and another in a quite different one. Most gains or losses are unconscious at the time, but count up in the course of the years spent on a campus. It is impossible, and undesirable, to steer the lives of students into fixed procedures. Growth condi tions should be studied and as favorable condi tions developed as resources will permit. But each individual must work out his own program, master his own difficulties, and discover for him self the superior ways of living. There is a definite place for courses in the his tory, psychology, philosophy, and literature of religion, if they are given by scholarly persons who have an interest in religious living. Mere knowledge of the shortcomings of the past will not do much good, but appreciation of the strug gles of mankind through the centuries to get basic meanings and to find a satisfying way of life, is stimulating to continued endeavor. Edu cated persons should know how to evaluate and improve existing conditions. Every instructor should feel a freedom to deal with religious fac tors in the courses he teaches ? not a sentimental harangue, but a due concern for spiritual values in the common adjustments of life. Faculty con ferences should develop wholesome attitudes and intelligent procedures in these incidental ap proaches to religion. Students should expect to deal as thoroughly with conditions which affect the human spirit as with those which are mechan istically described. There is scope for a wide vari ety of informal activities, but no organization once started should be allowed to develop vested interests and perpetuate itself when its continu ation is a waste of effort. Frequent appraisal of activities and programs should be made by student faculty committees, and suggestions made for their enrichment and cultural development. Norms such as the ten given in this paper may be found useful to diagnose and evaluate what is being done. Interaction with leaders in other institu tions may be fruitful if there is keen critical and constructive analysis in such meetings, rather than searching for a bag of tricks to liven up a dead program. In general let the terms religious, and spiritual, be given respectable content, mean ingful and challenging to students and faculty alike; and wherever the terms are used, let them represent up-grade living.</page></plain_text>
