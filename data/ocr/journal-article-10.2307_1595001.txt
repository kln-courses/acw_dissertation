<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASH'ARI AND THE ASH'ARITES IN ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS HISTORY THE ASH'ARITE MOVEMENT AND MUSLIM ORTHODOXY One of our commonly received notions concerning the historical development of Muslim Theology has been that Ash'arism became the orthodoxy of Islam in the 11th century (5th century of the Hijra) (1). This 11th century victory of (1) The first part of this study formed the subject of two communications of varying length delivered at the Annual Meeting of the American Oriental Society in Cambridge, Massachusetts Mass., in April, and at the University of Toronto, in November, 1962.-The following abreviations are used in this article: Daris: Nu'aimI ('Abd al-Qadir), ad-Daris fl tfdrkh al-maddris, ed.

In a study recently published (1), I concluded, among other things, that there was no such victory of Ash'arism in Baghdad. In the present study, I propose that we examine the claims of Ash'arism to orthodox victory after its failure in the 'Abbasid capital. To do this, we must follow the Ash'arite movement to its new rallying point in Damascus. There, we will call upon two witnesses: the 12th century Ibn 'Asakir and the 14th century Subki; both, eminent historians; both from Damascus; and both, fervent Ash'arite propagandists. We could hardly be accused of using witnesses whose testimony would be prejudicial to the Ash'arite cause. What we know of the history of the Ash'arite movement has, in effect, been based primarily on Ibn 'Asakir's Tabyin and Subki's Tabaqat. It is mainly to these two works that we owe the image we now have, in our manuals on Islam and Islamic history, of the development of Muslim theology in the Middle Ages. This image tells a story which may be said to consist of three general stages. In the first stage we have, on one side, the traditionalists, and on the other, the rationalists. The traditionalists rely on faith and shun reason; the rationalists glorify reason and have little use for faith. These two camps are continually at odds. Their perennial quarrels create a cleavage in theo- logical thinking. A period of trouble ensues in which the partisans of reason, with the help of the arm of secular power, persecute the partisans of faith. From this era emerges the figurehead of the great traditionalist Ahmad b. Hanbal, who heroically undergoes the great inquisition known as the mihna (2). Although he heroically survives it, the traditiona- (1) Muslim Institutions. (2) On this mihna, see Walter M. Patton, Ahmed Ibn f-anbal and the Mihna (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1897). 38 G. AMAKDISI</page><page sequence="3">ASH ARi AND TIE ASH'ARITES lists do not triumph; they continue to fight a losing battle. In the second stage we have the dramatic emergence of Ash'ari. At first a Mu'tazilite, Ash'ari turns renegade and joins the traditionalist camp. He brings along with him his rationalist weapons and places them in the service of traditionalism. An ideal situation comes into being: we have the beginnings of solid orthodoxy, with faith henceforth supported by reason. But somehow this solid orthodoxy does not take root. Ash'arl, having earned the wrath and ire of his erstwhile companions, the Mu'tazilite rationalists, does not, for all that, win the esteem and affection of his newly-chosen ones, the traditionalists. Among these, it is said, he is resisted by the "ultra-conservative" hanbalites. And this, in spite of the fact that he had placed himself under the banner of their heroic eponym, Ahmad b. Hanbal.-Ash'ari dies in the first part of the tenth century. A long period of silence follows his death. Then, towards the middle of the eleventh century, we see those who carry his name, the Ash'arites, being pursued, persecuted and dispersed to the four winds. All seems lost. But in the third stage, a sudden and dramatic reappearance is staged by these Ash'arites. Our attention is riveted by two prominent figures, a great theologian and a powerful prime- minister: Ghazzall and Niz5m al-Mulk. It is said that Nizam has a predilection for Ash'arites, because he is a good Shafi'ite. He takes them under his wing. -Ic establishes for them a network of institutions called the Nizamiya Colleges; and to them he turns over the endowed professorial chairs. To the greatest Ash'arite of all, Ghazzall, goes the chair of the greatest college of all, Baghdad's Nizamiya. Now, at last, with the right support and protection, the Ash'arites can breathe freely. And so, as the story goes, they set about propagating their doctrines unhindered. The Mu'tazilites, defeated, receive their coup de grdce, and fade away from the scene. The Hanbalites, though still very much alive, succeed only in making a nuisance of themselves with their die-hard traditionalism. The Ash'arites, however, keep to the middle course between these two extremist groups, and with triumph written all over them, march on as the dominant, largest, school of theology, 39</page><page sequence="4">carrying the banner of orthodoxy, straight through the centuries and down to modern times. This story has many versions. New elements are introduced which modify the details somewhat. But the main plot remains unchanged. The variations all play on the same theme. The images emerging maintain the same general outline. And the outline is clear and simple and sensible. That is why, on the whole, we have been satisfied with it for some time now. Indeed, there seemed to be no reason for not being satisfied. These lines of development which have been sketched correspond to those of other revealed religions; for instance, Christianity., Beginning with faith in the divine revelation, we have fideist traditionalism. Then we have the opposing current of skeptical rationalism. And finally, we have orthodoxy emerge as the sensible middle course between two extremes. To this reasonable explanation of the development of religious thought, there can hardly be any objection. The development itself is normal enough, and the history of thought attests to it. But the history of Islamic thought does not, to my mind, attest to Ash'arism's triumph as the orthodoxy of Islam in the Middle Ages. Ash'arism's alleged triumph in Baghdad in the eleventh century, under the aegis of Nizam al-Mulk, is due to a misreading of history(1). The sources clearly show a struggle, but no triumph. This point is sufficiently clear. After its failure in Baghdad, the Ash'arite movement moved on to Damascus. There, the sources attest once more to a struggle over a period of at least two centuries, and again without triumph. The old sources, I believe, make this point sufficiently clear. At least, this is what I hope to show in the following pages. Origin of the Ash'arile Image Our image of Ash'arism is the twin of that which has served to illustrate Ash'arite works. This should not surprise us. (1) See Muslim Instilutions, esp. pp. 3 and 47. 40 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="5">ASHI'AlI AND TIlE ASIICARITES For, in shaping it, we had followed the model fashioned in the best Ash'arite workshops. It was with the publication of an Ash'arite source(1) that Islamic studies in the field of Muslim theology got off to a serious start. This was more than a century ago. Since that time, Ash'arite sources have continued to attract the major part of our attention for knowledge concerning religious orthodoxy in Islam (2). Two of these source books, heavily relied upon, were written by two heresiographers who assured us that Ash'arism represented the final stage in the development of Muslim orthodoxy (3). These heresiographers happened to be Ash'arites. In affirmation of this Ash'arite axiom, two historians readily supplied us with the data needed in order to trace the historical development of this orthodoxy. These historians also happened to be Ash'arites. As the details of this image were being gradually filled in, one particular detail, of no small consequence, could not be made to fit. This was Ash'ari, eponym of the Ash'arite movement. Ash'arl, as represented by the Ash'arites, fitted well enough into the picture. It was Ash'ari, as we ourselves could see him in works attributed to him (4), who did not fit quite so easily. The Ibdna 'an usul ad-diydna showed him as a pure and simple traditionalist, a true follower of the arch- traditionalist Ahmad b. Hanbal. Here, Ash'ari was too much (1) Shahrastanl's al-Milal wa'n-nihial, translated into German by Theodor Haarbricker, Religionsparleien und Philosophenschulen, 2 vols. (Halle, 1850-1851). (2) Besides Shahrastinl's Milal, we will only cite a few, among others, made available by 1930: Ibn 'Asikir's Tabyin and Subki's Tabaqdl; BaghdadI's Farq bain al-firaq and Usul ad-din; and then those works attributed to Ash'arl himself: al-lbdna 'an uCsl ad-diynria, Isli!san al-khaud fi 'ilm al-kalam, and Maqalal al- islamly[n.

II, 167-332) as one of the key sources on Ash'arite history; see R. J. McCarthy, S. J., The Theology of Ash'arl (Beirut: Imprimerie Catholique, 1953). 41</page><page sequence="6">of a traditionalist to be Ash'arite. And the work entitled Maqalat al-islmityin further strengthened this traditionalist side of Ash'arl. On the other hand, the Istihsan al-khaud f 'ilm al-kalam made him out to be a zealous advocate of kalam, the use of which was the distinguishing mark of the rationalist, arch-enemy of the traditionalist. One of the founders of Islamic studies in the West, Ignaz Goldziher, was the first to be struck by the impact of the Ibana's message. From it he rightly understood that Ash'ari's theological stance was plainly IHanbalite-Traditionalist. And judging this work, rightly or not, to be the final expression of Ash'ari's religious beliefs, he could not help but come to what has since appeared as a drastic conclusion; namely, that Ash'ari had nothing to do with Ash'arite orthodoxy. Goldziher insisted that the credit for this orthodoxy must go not to Ash'ari, but to the Ash'arites (1). According to this view, the Ash'arites were not followers of Ash'ari; they merely came after him. This was indeed an unsettling thought. For how could we continue to talk about Ash'arite orthodoxy, if Ash'ar( had nothing to do with it? Wensinck it was who posed this reasonable question. He posed it because he, in turn, had arrived at a conclusion which was no less unsettling than that of Goldziher. Wensinck had been comparing the Iba,na's Ash'ari with Ash'ari as portrayed by an eminent Ash'arite, Imam al-Haramain al-Juwaini (2). This portrayal, which made of Ash'ari an out and out rationalist, was reinforced by the publication of a new treatise attributed to Ash'arl, the above-mentioned Istihsan (3). Since the Ibana, on the other hand, made of Ash'ari an out and out traditionalist, Wensinck (1) Ignaz Goldziher, Vorlesungen uber den Islam, 2nd ed. Franz Babinger (Heidelberg: C. Winter, 1925), 121; Ignaz Goldziher, Le dogme et la loi de l'Islam, transl. Felix Arin (Paris: P. Geuthner, 1920), 101. (2) A. J. Wensinck, The Muslim Creed (Cambridge University Press, 1932), 92-93. (3) Published in 1905, and excerpted by M. Horten in 1912 (see Die Philoso- phischen Systeme der spekulaliven Theologen im Islam, 623), the work was most likely known to Goldziher who could have discounted its message because he considered the Ibana to be the last work of Ash'arl, representative of his last theological attitude. Horten's book was dedicated to Goldziher. 42 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="7">ASH'ARI AND THE ASII ARITES could not help but ask himself whether Ash'ari was in fact "a man with two faces?" (1) For if we are to take Ash'ari as portrayed in his works and by the Ash'arites, it would be easy to see that Ash'ari either had a "double", or a split personality. No doubt Wensinck's thought was also drastic; but, like Goldziher's thought, it was far from being idle. The surprising thing about it is that it had not been conceived at a much earlier date. For the Ash'arite propagandists themselves had been spreading the idea of a two-way Ash'ari over a period of centuries. Ash'arite Shahrastani (d. 548/1153) ends his outline of the historical development of Muslim orthodoxy with a simple declaration of Ash'ari's two ways (2). Subki (d. 771/1370), perhaps the greatest known Ash'arite propagandist, also speaks of Ash'ari's two ways (3). Thus the disturbing notion of a two-way Ash'arl, finally conceived by Western scholarship, would not have disturbed the Ash'arites in the least. This Ash'arite notion was a "home-grown" product which the Ash'arites had developed over the centuries and hopefully tried to convey to their readers. We can therefore no longer charge such Western scholars as Wensinck with being "out of sympathy" with Ash'ari (4); his disturbing question was only the logical result of the Ash'arite materials he had faithfully studied. The Ash'arites themselves would not have thought him to be out of sympathy with Ash'ari. On the contrary, they would have thought him to be rightly guided and would have hoped that he would only (1) A. J. Wensinck, The Muslim Creed, 91.

("The doctrine of al-KhatIb [al-BaghdadI, d. 463/1071] regarding the divine attributes is that they should be allowed to pass intact (to posterity) just as they came (to us)... This is also Ash'arI's doctrine... Ash'arl has also another doctrine upholding metaphorical interpretation."). (4) See W. Montgomery Watt, Free Will and Predeslinalion in Early Islam (London: Luzac, 1948), 135. 43</page><page sequence="8">make up his mind and answer his own question as to Ash'ari's two faces in the affirmative. No sooner do we see this harmony between Wensinck and the Ash'arites than we begin to have some "disturbing" questions of our own. Why should Ash'arite propagandists wish to cast such dubious light on the eponym of their school? Why do they admit, let alone insist upon, a two-way Ash'ari? After much pondering, hesitation and misgiving, one finally begins to see the light. These Ash'arites are quite serious in their purpose. They have not the slightest desire for us to see in Ash'ari a "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". What they desire us to see in him is a normal man with two profiles, one markedly different from the other, but both constituting the identifica- tion of one and the same thing, in the same manner as the two sides of a coin. But what did the Ash'arites hope to gain by disseminating the image of a two-way Ash'ari? What benefit did they expect to derive and from what source? It is in Ash'arite propaganda, when carefully read in the light of events contempo- rary with it, that the -most reliable answers to these questions may be found. Thus we may learn that the Ash'arites were in need of (1) gaiing legitimacy for their doctrines, (2) in order to be admitted into the ranks of the orthodox, (3) through membership in the Sh5fi'ite school of law. This was not a new scheme originating with the Ash'arites. It was an old one used before them by the Mu'tazilites. Orthodoxy and the Sunnile Schools of Law In order to see why a sunnite school of law was the principal object of Ash'arite propaganda, it is necessary to understand the position occupied by the schools of law in the general scheme of Muslim orthodoxy. This will help us at the same time to understand what determined orthodoxy itself in Islam which, then as now, had no councils or synods to define it. Orthodoxy in Islam represents that which is standard, in the sense that the overwhelming majority in Islam constitutes its 44 G. MIAKDISI</page><page sequence="9">ASHAIARI AND TIIE ASH'ARITES membership (1). It is in this sense that Sunnism (now 90% of Islam) is orthodox. From Sunnism's point of view, Shi'ism (9%) and Kharijism (1%) are heterodox. Sunnite orthodoxy is determined by membership in one of the Sunnite schools of law, all of which follow the sunna (tradition) of the Prophet. This is in contradistinction to the Shi'ites who also admit the authoritative teaching of the Imams. At the time with which we are now concerned, there were five recognized sunnite schools of law: the Hanafite, Malikite, Shafi'ite, IHanbalite and Zahirite (2). The most practical means of determining orthodoxy was membership in one of the Sunnite schools of law. To be a member of a school of law, one had only to adhere to its juridical system. These schools were the guardians of the divine positive law (sharf'a) which embraced both the civil as well as the religious life of the faithful. The rise of institutions of learning in the llth century, as I attempted to show in a recent study (3), was the rise of the colleges of law. The highest recognition was reserved for the professor of law-the jurisconsult. There were no professorial chairs for the other teaching positions (4). And kaldm theo- logians, that is, experts on the science of kalam, did not, as such, have any teaching position whatever. This being the case, each legal system, with its endowed exclusive colleges of law (the masjid, the madrasa), became, as it were, a recruiting center for orthodoxy. There was rivalry among the various legal systems for greater membership. Greater membership led to greater influence in the community; and this influence led, in turn, to greater financial support from those in power who were interested in controlling the masses. (1) Cf. J. Schacht, New Sources for the History of Muhammadan Theology, in Sfudia Islamica, I, 36. (2) The Zahirite School has since become extinct for reasons which will be mentioned in part II of this article. (3) Muslim Inslitulions. (4) Such as that of the Koranic reader, the expert on traditions, the grammarian. These men held lectureships, not professorial chairs, their subjects being subsidiary in relation to the study of law. See Muslim Inslilulions, 11; sec also the endowment charter of the Nizamlya College of Baghdad, op. cil., 37.</page><page sequence="10">The rise of the college of law as the only endowed exclusive institution meant something more than a highly organized recruiting center. It meant that any system of thought, in order to survive, had to be affiliated with one of the schools of law. A theological system, in order to be sanctioned as legiti- mate, to propagate its doctrine, to provide for its perpetuation, had to be adopted by a legal system. Like all theological systems, Ash'arite theology was in need of such adoption. For there were no endowed theological colleges; hence, no recruiting centers for theological systems; hence, also, the "infiltration" of the schools of law by the schools of theology (1). This need was clearly understood by all three major theological systems of the period. Traditionalism was safely and solidly entrenched in every one of the schools of law, with the Hanbalite school acting as spearhead of the movement. From this strong position, traditionalism pitted itself against the other two movements: first, Mu'tazilism, in its efforts to infiltrate the IHanafite school of law; then, Ash'arism, the object of our present concern, in its efforts to infiltrate the Shafi'ite school. Why, one may ask, did the Ash'arites concentrate their efforts on the Shafi'ite school of law? An answer to this question may be arrived at by way of elimination. The Hanafite school was still strongly infiltrated by Mu'tazilism when rationalist Ash'arism sought to make its bid for orthodoxy. The Malikite school was on the wane in Baghdad where, in comparison with the other schools of law, it had not been too strongly represented. Its prospects as a "recruiting center" were almost nil (2). As for the Hanbalite school, not only was it overwhelmingly traditionalist, it was also too insular, concen- trated, as it was, in Baghdad and its environs. The Zahirite school was on the wane, more so than the Malikite; indeed, it was destined to become extinct in the 11th century in Baghdad. (1) We have discussed at length the relationship of the schools of law to the schools of theology in a forthcoming book. (2) Its exclusive institutions of learning, if it had any such institutions in Baghdad, were not prominent. See, in contrast, those of the other schools of law, in Muslim Institutions, 17 if., 23 ff., 26 ff. 46 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="11">ASII ARI AND TIIE ASII'ARITES The Shafi'ite school of law presented the best available opportunities, though these were hindered by a serious draw- back. A major school in Baghdad, it was also broadly represented throughout the eastern caliphate. This broad representation facilitated infiltration, especially outside of Baghdad, particularly in Khurasan. The serious drawback was that the Shafi'ite school was highly traditionalist. By reason of their greater majority in the Muslim community, the Hanafite and Shafi'ite schools, with extensive memberships throughout the lands of the eastern caliphate, presented rationalism with the best opportunities for successful infiltration and, hence, legitimacy. And of these two schools, the Hanafite was the more prone to rationalism, and its element of tradition was weaker. Ash'arism may well have attempted to dislodge Mu'tazilism and take the latter's place in the Hanafite school. Such a reason may have been at the basis of the struggle between Hanafite Mu'tazilites and Shafi'ite Ash'arites in Khurasan, in the first part of the 11th century. Its upshot in 445/1053 was the cursing of Ash'ari publicly from the pulpits by order of the Great Saljuq Tughril Beg, as advised by his minister Kunduri. Both Tughril Beg and Kunduri were Hanafites. However this may be, the Ash'arites, after the advent of Nizam and his Nizamiya Colleges, concentrated their efforts on the Shafi'ite School. Ash'arism's object being legitimacy, any of the four schools could have served the purpose, at least at the start. The ideal situation was the eventual infiltration of all the schools of law. That this was in fact the ambition of the Ash'arite movement is sufficiently clear from the state- ments of the Ash'arite propagandists who not only boasted membership in all four schools, but claimed that all of them, except for ultra-rationalists (Mu'tazilites) and crass anthropo- morphists (their way of designating traditionalist Hanbalites), believed in the Ash'arite creed. But only traditionalism could realistically boast of a significant membership in every school of law. The great struggle which began in the 11th century was not between Ash'arites and Mu'tazilites, nor even between Ash'arites and Hanbalites; it was a struggle of rationalist Ash'arism against the overwhelming traditionalist 47</page><page sequence="12">forces of all sunnite schools of law. That is why, first in Baghdad, and later in Damascus, that stronghold of traditiona- lism which was the Shafi'ite school of law, proved for the Ash'arites a very hard nut to crack. Some Theological Terminology In order to appreciate Ash'arite propaganda adequately, it is necessary to understand some technical terms relative to theology. These terms belong to the sphere of dogmatic theology, not juridical theology. The reason for this is simple enough: law was not a point of contention. For instance, usul al-fiqh (sources or principles of law), fiqh (law), and faqih (jurisconsult), are terms the contents of which are agreed upon by all. Not so the terminology used in theology. To a traditionalist, i. e. a follower of the Pious Ancestors (Salaf), theology is designated by the term usuil ad-din, meaning literally the sources or principles of religion, on the analogy of usul al-fiqh, meaning literally the sources or principles of law, and hence legal theory and methodology. However, another term which came to designate theology is kalam. But this term is reserved by the traditionalist theologian to designate only that type of theology in l indulged in by the rationalist. Whereas the rationalist theologian uses both terms inter- changeably, equating kaldm with usul ad-din, the traditionalist regards usul ad-din as the only legitimate king of theology, and condemns kaldm and its partisans as outside the pale of orthodoxy (1). Anti-kalam literature abounds in the writings of traditionalists. It is directed not merely against the Mu'tazi- lites, but also, and especially, against the Ash'arites (2). (1) The partisan of kaldim is fully aware of tle difference in language usage regarding lkaltin. Cf. below, p. 50 n. 1; ef. also Subkl in his Tabaqad (I, 197), where he refers to Ahl al-lalam as Ahl ad-din (the partisans of religion, the people of religion), on the analogy of usul ad-din, instead of kaldm. He does this on the occasion of one of his frequent attacks against Dhahabi who, says Subkl, criticizes Ahl ad-din. It is quite obvious that DhahabI opposes Ahl al-kalam, not Ahl ad-dln. (2) Few of these works carry the condemnation in the title itself, as, for instance, in the case of the Shfi'ite traditionalist AbC Sulaimfin al-KhattabI al-Bustl 48 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="13">ASH ARI AND TIHE ASH'ARITES 49 To a traditionalist, a legitimate theologian is one who belongs to Ahl al-Hadith, the partisans of tradition, who set themselves against Ahl al-Kalam, the partisans of kaldm, singly designated as mutakallim, that is, a kalam-expert. It is interesting to note, at this point, that the traditionalist has no term with which to designate the single partisan of tradition, as muta- kallim is the single partisan of Ahl al-Kalam. The term muhaddith is not derived from Ahl al-.Hadfih; for muhaddith means a hadifh-expert, an expert on Muslim traditions. Such an expert could be a rationalist or a traditionalist. For this reason, in order to avoid ambiguity, we shall refer to a muhaddith as a traditionist (not necessarily traditionalist, as opposed to rationalist). Thus there is no term for a single partisan of tradition. He may be a jurisconsult (faqih) or a traditionist (muhaddith) who is said to be "of the partisans of tradition" (a traditionalist), as distinguished from the partisans of kaldm (a rationalist). The traditionalist is careful in the use of his terms, for he is anxious to keep a sharp distinction between the domain of traditionalism, which he considers to be legitimate, and the domain of rationalism which, to him, is not. On the other hand, the rationalist uses key terms interchangeably, or associates one set of terms with the other in such fashion as to blurr the lines of demarcation and render them vague. His tactics succeed with the passage of time, to the extent that the clarification of terms becomes a never-ending preoccuptation of the traditionalist. For the traditionalist, knowing his position to be that of the orthodox majority, is jealous and possessive of his heritage and is forever setting up boundaries to keep the rationalist minority (d. 388 HI.), author of al-Ghunya 'an al-kaldm wa-ahlih, "Freedom from need of kaldm and its partisans" (Tabaqdt, II, 218, line 15), or of the Hanbalite mystic, al-Anslrl al-larawl (d. 481 II.), Dhamm al-kaldm, "The Censure of Kaldm", or of the Il.anbalite traditionalist Ibn QudSma (d. 622 II.), Tahrtm an-na;ar fl kulub ahl al-kaldm (G. Makdisi, lbn Qudama's Censure of Speculalive Theology [GMS, N. S. XXIII], London, 1962); but the censure of kaldm is nevertheless an essential part of traditionalist literature, as for instance in other works of Ibn Qudama and in a great number of works by Ibn Taimlya (d. 728 H.) and other traditionalists. 4</page><page sequence="14">out. Whereas the rationalist is forever upsetting these boundaries in order to get himself in (1). What is this kaldm which is censured by the traditionalists? The word itself means "discourse", "speech", "words", and as such it may be applied as a technical term to various things. The famous traditionalist Ibn Taimiya recognizing the ambiguity of the term, tries to make matters clear (2). He first makes a statement as to what kalcm is not. The kaldm which was censured by the Pious Ancestors and the Imams (such as Malik and Ibn Hanbal) was not the discourse of the Qadarites, as claimed by Baihaqi and Ibn 'Asikir who wanted to exculpate their Ash'arite companions. Nor is that kaldm which was censured by the Pious Ancestors the mere use of reasoning (nazar), argumentation (ihlijdj) and disputation (mundzara). It is rather that science which attempts to discourse on matters which are properly articles of faith (3). Thus it is the introduction of such philosophical terms as accident, body, substance, etc., in the articles of belief, and reasoning, argu- menting and disputing with regard to them-this is the kaldm which was censured by the Pions Ancestors. The distinction between a traditionalist and a rationalist may best be illustrated in their respective attitudes with regard to the divine attributes. And this may usefully be done by briefly sketching Shahrastani's account of the historical development of Muslim theology from the time of the Pious (1) It is only when a clarification serves his purpose that the rationalist will insist upon it. As, for instance, in the case of Subkl who, in order to minimize Ghazzali's detrimental statements concerning kalam, is anxious to show that Ghazzali's books on usuil ad-din (dogmatic theology) are not kaldm (speculative, rationalist, theology), "according to tlhe method of the kalam-experts." (See Tabaqdt, IV, 103, lines 18-19). Elsewhere (op. cit., IV, 242, line 12), Subkl, when citing a book on u.sul ad-din, makes it clear that the work is "according to the doctrine of the Pious Ancestors" ('ald maddhab as-salaf) as distinguished from that of the kaldm experts. (Cf. Kashf, I, 977, where the same work is cited). (2) Ibn Taimiya, Iilab anr-nubuwal (Cairo: Munlrlya Press, 1346/1928), 146 ff. (3) Cf. op. cil., 147, line 19: "wa-hadhihi hiya usulu 'd-dini wa'l-lmdn". As for instance the matter of allirniing the existence of the Creator on the basis of the contingency of bodies, and the contingency of bodies on the basis that accidents can exist only in a body and that that which has accidents is of necessity contingent. This, says Ibn Taimiya, does not affrm the existence of God or any other of those articles of faith such as the resurrection, prophethood and the rest. 50 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="15">ASH'ARi AND TIIE ASH'ARITES Ancestors down to Ash'ari (1). This will serve to show how Ash'arite Shahrastani associates Ash'ari with the Pious Ancestors. The Mu'tazilites, who have been called the first rationalists of Islam, denied the divine attributes; thus they were called mu'af!ila, or partisans of ta'Il, meaning the denudation of God of His attributes. The Mu'tazilites were the first users of kaldm. They did away with the divine attributes by the use of metaphorical interpretation (la'wll). The Pious Ancestors, Salaf, who upheld the divine attributes were called sifda[ya, because they affirmed the attributes (ithbdt as-sifda). They opposed and censured kalam and metaphorical interpretation. Some of the Salaf exaggerated their affirmation of the divine attributes and thus fell into anthropomorphism, i. e., lashbih, and were called the mushabbiha, partisans of tashb[h (the ascription of human characteristics to God). Between the extreme of Mu'tazilism's ta'?il by use of la'wLl and anthropomorphism's tashbTh, another group of Pious Ancestors followed what they believed to be the orthodox middle road; i.e., acceptance of the scriptural references to God's attributes as they are, without ta'wTl and without lashbih. Their attitude is described as that of tafwTd, leaving their real meaning to God, or ijrd' and imrdr, letting the scriptural texts pass on intact as they were handed down. Then Shahrastani tells us that such was the attitude of the Pious Ancestors, like Malik, Ibn IHanbal, Sufyan and Dawud al-Isbahani, down to Kullabi, Qalanisi and Muhasibi, and declares that these latter were the first users of kalam among the Pious Ancestors. Shahrastani goes on to say that it is this group of kalam- using Pious Ancestors that Ash'arl joined after leaving the Mu'tazilites. And since that time the term sifadiya was applied to the Ash'arites, as upholders of the divine attributes. Then Shahrastani says that Ash'ari is known to have followed the method of the Pious Ancestors, namely, affirming the (1) See Shahrastanl, Milal, I, 116-119. 51</page><page sequence="16">divine attributes as they are handed down in scripture without running the risk of using ta'wTl. But Shahrastani adds that this is only one of two doctrines ascribed to Ash'ari, the other being the admissibility of ta'wtl (1). This makes Ash'ari the follower of two middle roads: (1) that of the Pious Ancestors who were anxious to avoid two extremes: ta'wfl and tashb[h; and (2) that of the "kalam-using orthodox" who wanted to uphold the divine attributes, against the Mu'tazilites, and uphold the use of ta'wTl in order to avoid falling into tashbTh. The former attitude is regarded by the Ash'arites as being fartq as-salama, the road of salvation, and the latter is regarded by them as being lariq al-hikma, the road of wisdom; both of which roads were travelled by Ash'ari himself. By virtue of Ash'ari's two middle roads, those who followed the one or the other were equally Ash'arite, equally orthodox. Two PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF THE ASH'ARITE STORY Two biographical works have played a major role as sources for the history of the Ash'arite movement. Both were written by Ash'arites. These sources have not been examined as closely as they deserve to be. It is not merely that, being authored by Ash'arites, these sources are biased; traditionalist sources are no less biased in favor of traditionalism. It is rather that these sources have been used mainly for what direct information they could give us on Ash'arism, information which is undeniably valuable for Ash'arite history; they have yet to be used seriously for what indirect information they contain, information which the authors did not set out to convey, but which they could not avoid doing, being themselves a product of their own times. In the mine of information which these sources have been known to represent, there are therefore still some rich veins that lhave yet to be tapped (2). (1) Op. ci!., I, 132. (2) The analyses which follow, far from being exhaustive, are adequate, I believe, for the purpose at hand. 52 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="17">ASH ARI AND THE ASII'ARITES The first source is the Tabyin of Ibn 'Asakir (d. 571 H.) (1); and the second, the Tabaqdl of TSj ad-Din as-Subki (d. 771 H.) (2). Ibn 'Asdkir's Tabyin The first part of the Tabyin is concerned with Ash'ari. A laudatory biographical sketch seeks to establish his greatness on the basis of his noble Arab ancestry and the excellence of his doctrine as that of the middle position. This part takes up more than one-third of the book (153 pages). The second part is taken up with biographical notices of representative Ash'arites, divided into generations of disciples, from the time of Ash'ari down to that of the author: eighty-one Ash'arites in all. This part is equal to the first part. The third part consists of the legitimacy of kaldm and of Ash'arism (30 pages), followed by a refutation of an adversary, Ahwazi (62 pages), and the conclu- sion (5 pages). W. Spitta was the first to make extensive use of the TabyTn of Ibn 'Asakir in his study on Ash'ari (3). Speaking of the Tabyin, he says that the work owes its existence to a fight between the Ash'arite and Mu'tazilite sects. Thus the Tabyin was supposed to be aimed at a Mu'tazilite by the name of Abi 'All al-Ahwazi (4). A. F. Mehren, who was the first to outline the Tabyin as a study on Ash'ari and the Ash'arites, referred to the section on kaldm as a long digression (5). In a book which is supposed (1) Ibn 'Asakir, Taby[n kadhib al-muftari fi md nusiba ild 'l-imam Abl'l-Hasan al-Ash'arl (Damascus: al-Tauflq Press, 1347/1928-9).

J., in The Theology of al-Ash'ari, 145 ff., where in reference to the section on "The Legitimacy of KIaldn" (see op. cit., 183, note 63), the author says that "it seems significant that lbn 'Asakir finds it relevant, and possibly necessary, to devote so much space to the subject." 53</page><page sequence="18">to be a defense of Ash'ari against the false accusation of a Mu'tazilite, a long section in defense of kaldm would not be merely digressive; it would be contrary to the purpose of the author. For the Mu'tazilites were themselves the very founders of kaldm. Why waste time in convincing a Mu'tazilite of its legitimacy? This would have been something on the order of carrying coals to Newcastle. But such was not the case. The adversary, Abu 'All al- Ahwazi, was a Salimite, not a Mu'tazilite. Ibn 'Asakir himself designates him as such in his Tabyin (1). The Hanbalite Ibn Taimiya confirms it in his Minhdj (2). Spitta bases his information concerning the Mu'tazilism of Ahwazi on Ibn 'Asakir's Tabyin, of which he was using a manuscript in the Leipzig University Library (3). It is possible that this manuscript has a lacuna where the author speaks of the Salimism of AhwazI (4), and that Spitta bases the Mu'tazilism of Ahwazl on a text in the Tabyin which refers to another person, 'Ali b. Ahmad al-Baghdadi, whom Ibn 'Asakir designates as a Mu'tazilite (5). The Salimites are known for their hostility against the partisans of kaldm (6). In the light of this fact, the long section devoted by Ibn 'Asakir, in his Tabyin, to the legitimacy of kaldm, is quite understandable and not at all digressive. Nevertheless, Ibn 'Asakir was not primarily interested in refuting Ahwazi, who died in the century previous to his own (7). Ibn 'Asakir was not interested in justifying kaldm in the eyes (1) See Tabyin, 369 (line 5). (2) See Ibn TaimIya, Minhdj as-sunna, III, 66 (lines 4-6). (3) W. Spitta, op. cil., 11; cf. GAL, I, 331.

He was interested in justifying Ash'arism in the eyes of the traditionalists of his own Shafi'ite school of law. Kaalm was the main stumbling block in the way of winning over these Shafi'ites. And Ash'arism, in order to preserve its identity, had first and foremost to preserve kalam. For Ash'arism, without kalam, would be traditionalism pure and simple. Hence Ibn 'Asakir's case for kalam's legitimacy. The proof that the Shafi'ite traditionalists were the main object of Ibn 'Asakir's propaganda efforts can be found in this all-important part of his book (1). The traditionalists, in fighting against kalam, always invoked the dicta of the Pious Ancestors (Salaf) and ancient imams against it (2). It is altogether beside the point whether these dicta were authentic or not. What matters is that they were accepted by the traditionalists as being authentic; and Ibn 'Asakir himself deals with them as such. He does not attempt to show that they are false. Such an attempt, if indeed he entertained it at any moment, would have been disastrous to his cause. One simply does not endear himself to a traditionalist by telling him that his traditions are worthless old wives' tales. Instead, Ibn 'Asakir re-interprets these traditions in an attempt to render them harmless. Now there were many ancient imams to whom such dicta have been attributed, including Shafi'L. But Ibn 'Asakir's principal interest was in Shafi'i. That is why the main part of his re-interpretation efforts is devoted to those traditions attributed to Shafi'i. Also, at the very beginning of this section on the legitimacy of kaldm, Ibn 'Asakir quotes a saying, which must have had a wide currency in his day, to the effect that if no other than Shafi'i had condemned kaldam, Shafi'i's condemnation alone would have been sufficient (3). It is in the countering of this objection to kalad that Ibn"Asakir employs (1) Tabyin, 333 IT. (2) For these Salaf, or ancient imams, see M. Schreiner, "Beitrage zur Geschichte der theologischen Bewegungen im Islam", in ZDMG, LII, 52S8 T., section IV: "Die dogmatischen Ansichten der alten ImAme," to which section many more: names could be added. (3) Tabyin, 333, line 8: "wa-lau lam yadhummahum [i.e. the kaldme-experts] ghairu 'sh-Shdafl'[-rahimahu 'llah-la-kafa." 55</page><page sequence="20">all his skill and ingenuity. But why should Ibn 'Asakir be more concerned about Shafi'i than about the great ancient fathers of Islam? Not merely because he himself was a Shafi'ite, but also, and especially, because those whom he was trying to win over to the Ash'arite cause were Shafi'ites. And if Shafi'i himself had condemned kaldm, true followers of Shafi'i had no business adopting it. Hence the need to prove that Shafi'i had not condemned kaldm. To produce such proof was not an easy matter. For, in order to do so, Ibn 'Asakir, and later Subki, had to discredit the testimony of the great Ghazzali on the subject. Known as an Ash'arite as well as a Shafi'ite, Ghazzali occupied a middle position with respect to the problem of kaldm's legitimacy. He was neither totally for it, nor totally against it. His attitude was that this science should be used with caution, and only by those who can handle it with skill. It was not, however, this view of kaldm which stood in the way of its Ash'arite advocates. Both Ibn 'Asakir and Subki make extensive use of this idea of Ghazzali. One great obstacle standing in the way of Ash'arite kaldm was that Ghazz5al had very plainly listed Shafi'i himself at the head of a list of fathers of Islam who held the view of kaldm's illegitimacy (1). It is a simple enough matter to argue a point against a tradi- tionalist, even a Shafi'ite traditionalist if need be; but it becomes a very delicate matter when those who must be argued against are of one's own school, Ghazzali, highly respected as both an Ash'arite as well as a Shafi'ite. This is where the fine art of allusion is put to use. In the introduction to the Taby[n, Ibn 'Asakir alludes to Ghazzali's work, Iljdm al-'awdmmn 'an 'ilm al-kaldm (The restraining [literally: the reining in] of the common people from the science of kaldm), by saying that Ash'arT, more than anyone else, attached the greatest importance to doing just (1) See Ghazz1a, Ihya' 'ulim ad-dln (Cairo: Mustafa BabI al-HalabI Press, 1358/1939, 4 vols.) Book ii, Section ii, first mas'ala, I, 100, line 26: "wa-ila 't- tahrlmi dhahaba 'sh-Shafi'l wa-Mdlik wa-Ahmad b. ganbal wa-Sufyan [alh-Thaurl] wa-jaml'u Ahl al-hadllh mina 's-Salaf. 56 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="21">ASH ARI AND TIIE ASIIHARITES this. It is therefore to be understood that Ash'ari was already restraining the common people from kaldm long before Ghazzali's time and message. And at the very outset of his section in defense of kalam, Ibn 'Asakir devotes his time to presenting the fathers of Islam, Shafi'i among the first, as in favor of kaldm. We are therefore a long way from a refutation of Salimism or Mu'tazilism. Indeed, the Mu'tazilite founders of kalam could only have cause to rejoice in their graves. They could boast of having fathered the very science which Ibn 'Asakir was now employing himself so zealously in making palatable to Shafi'i's followers. They could even marvel at Ibn 'Asakir's boldly attempted tour de force. For the task which Ibn 'Asakir had set out for himself was not simple. It was no less than the reshaping of the image of the Mu'tazilite rationalist science of kaldm in the minds of his Shafi'ite anti-rationalist colleagues, in such fashion as to make this science appear as though it had come from the ancient fathers themselves. He was making this attempt in face of the centuries-long Shafi'ite tradition against it. But Shafi'ite traditionalists, like all other traditionalists, had too strong, and too long, a memory. If tlicy were impressed with Ibn 'Asakir's eloquence, tlicy were not impressed with his message. His attempt failed. And other lesser stars in the rationalist Ash'arite firmament continued to rise (1), but to no avail. Ash'arism was in need of a powerful champion. But two long centuries had to pass before a worthy successor to Ibn 'Asakir could take up its cause. Subkt's Tabaqat Ibn 'Asakir's Tabyin is Ash'arite propaganda; this is quite obvious. One has only to read the title of the work to see that it is a defense of Ash'ari (2). But it is not as obvious that the (1) Cf. the treatise of al-Qurtubl (d. 672/1272) the title of which is reminiscent of Ibn 'AsSkir's Tabyin: Zajr al-IMuflarl 'ald Abl 'I-Hasan al-Ash'art, quoted by Subkl, in his Tabaqda, II, 288 iT., together with a eulogy of this treatise by Ibn Daqlq al-'Id (d. 702/1302), Tabaqdt, II, 297 Tf.; see GAL, Suppl. I, 490.

With Subki's Tabaqat ash-shafi'iya, the situation is reversed. One reads the title and sees that it is meant for the Shafi'ites (1). But it is not as obvious that it contains an appeal, and that this appeal is on behalf of Ash'arism. Ibn 'Asakir's "defense of Ash'ari" could only attract the attention of Ash'arites; a Shafi'ite had first to read the book before he could see that it was meant for him; and, in the process, he may well have missed the point, for it was a subtle point. That is why Subki, who understood subtleties and the Tabyin very well, thought it wise to drive this subtle point home by advertising to the Shafi'ites that the Tabyin was really meant for them (2). But while fully endorsing the Taby n, Subki had his own ideas on how to approach the problem. Obviously, Ibn 'Asakir had not done the job satisfactorily; at least, not well enough to have obviated the necessity of its being done over again. To Ibn 'Asakir's weapons, he added some of his own, planned his own strategy and moved to new and more familiar grounds. For his own propaganda, Subki chose an unmistakably Shafi'ite medium. He wanted the very title of his book to draw the Shafi'ites' attention. Should a Shafi'ite be so blind as not to see it, he was bound, at some point of his career as a Shafi'ite jurisconsult, to trip over it. After Ibn 'Asakir, Subki is the best known advocate of Ash'arism and, of the two, the better qualified for the task at hand. Ibn 'Asakir was an expert on traditions who belonged to the Shafi'ite school of law. With his authority as a traditionist, he could approach and speak to those in his school who clung to the traditions and resisted the Ash'arite innovation. But Subkl, in addition to being an expert on traditions in his own right, was also a shrewd lawyer. He was equally at ease with those who knew the traditions as with those who knew the law. And law and traditions were the two massive pillars (1) Tabaqdt ash-shafi 'iya. (The classes of Shafi'ite jurisconsults), of which Subkl produced three editions of varying length: great, medium and small (kubra, wusta, sughra). See Kashf, 1099, 1101, and GAL, Suppl. II, 106. (2) See below, p. 59, where SubkI endorses the Tabyin as required reading for the true Shafi'ite jurisconsult. 58 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="23">ASH'ARI AND THE ASHIARITES supporting thegreat edifice of the Shl fi'ite school. Ibn 'Asikir's Taby[n was written principally for the world of traditions in the Shafi'ite school. Subli's Tabaqdl was written for both worlds in that school, the world of law as well as the world of traditions. Subkl himself makes this point very clear. From the start, he describes his book as being a work on history, literature, law and traditions (1). Later he again draws the attention of the reader to this fact (2). And it is also a fact that in his monumental workhe consigns a treasure of literary and historical documents, especially those on law and tradition (3), which make his work a valuable sourcebook for Shafi'ites. Through this medium, Subki could bring about a conviction among Shafi'ites in favor of Ash'arism. Subkl was a capable propagandist and in his monumental work he had ample opportunity to mold the opinions and judgments of the majority of Shafi'ites by playing on their emotional attitudes. His work was no piece of difficult theo- logical reasoning; the story he was writing was principally the story of Shafi'ism. But in it he makes his assertions for Ash'arism1 assertions he never tires of repeating and the cumulative effect of which is undeniably strong. His procedures, which we will examine presently, are many and varied, according to the particular case at hand. When he does not misrepresent unpleasant facts, he reinterprets them. When they are too well-known to be concealed, he mentions them without comment. His adversaries, the Hanbalite-traditionalists, come in for a lot of old name-calling; and the Shafi'ite traditionalists who give him the most trouble are dubbed as Hanbalite sympathizers. In doing this, he hopes to isolate the strong traditionalist elements within the Shafi'ite school, by creating a psychological barrier between them and the Shafi'ites who are yet uncommitted or still capable of changing camps. (1) Tabaql, I, 109. (2) Op. cit., I, 176. (3) Subkl gives a long list of the chains of transmi ters used by him in his work; see Tabaqd1, I, 167 ff. 59</page><page sequence="24">Subki constantly strives to create a favorable attitude on the part of Shafi'iles towards Ash'arite rationalism. In his book, the vocabularies of traditionalism and rationalism are intermingled; the purpose being to render the latter as acceptable as the former by association therewith. For uppermost in Subki's mind is the creation of a new image of theShafi'ite school of law; a school composed of traditionalists and rationalists, a broad-minded school, inclusive of all the religious sciences, especially kaldm, leader among the orthodox schools of law. In contrast thereto he fashions another image wherein he confines his enemies: a motley crew of narrow-minded anthropomorphists, weak-minded traditionalists and so-called scholars, who either parrot traditions they do not understand orfabricate traditions in an attempt to further their narrow ends In this group he ranges the Hanbalites and, with them, those intransigent Shafi'ite traditionalists who not only are too strongly anti- Ash'arite to be won over to the cause, but who do it the greatest harm. Ash'arite propaganda in SubkI's Tabaqdt may be seen in three aspects of his work. First and foremost in his defense of kaldm and Ash'arism as legitimate and representative of orthodoxy; secondly, in his appeal to the Sh5fi'ites on behalf of Ash'arism; and thirdly, in his attack against the anti- Ash'arites, especially those of the Shdfi'ite school, not merely those of other schools. In all of this, Subki was interested in convincing the Safi'ites, members of that school whose history he was in the process of writing Legitimacy of Kalam and of Ash'arism Subki's method of dealing with anti-kaldm traditions is an improvement over that of Ibn 'Asakir. This improvement may be seen in Subki's citation of a tradition attributed to Shafi'i, on the authority of the well-known traditionist Ibn 'Abd al-BaTr (1). The text of the tradition is so clearly and (1) AbQ 'Umar Yfsuf b. 'Abd Allah al-QurtubI (d. 463/1071); see GAL, I, 367-368, Suppl. I, 628-629. 60 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="25">ASI' ARI AND THE ASII'ARITES definitely anti-kalam that one wonders in anticipation how Subki will extract the anti-rationalist venom from it and render it harmless. But Subki has no intention of going into a long- winded and complicated explanation. He merely affirms that such traditions as this one have been related in censure of kaldm. He then also affirms that other traditions have also been related which contradict them (1). Thus, allowed to stand as they are, the two sets of contradictory traditions cancel each other out. Subki then refers the reader, for further details, to Ibn 'Asakir's Tabyin and to his own Man' al-mawdni'; there, the reader will gather that the traditions to believe are the traditions in favor of kaldm (2). Subki will even admit that kaldm is a dangerous science. This he readily and frequently concedes. But he hastens to add that, dangerous though it may be, kaldm is necessary (3). The best thing to do is simply not to begin a discussion, unless an urgent, pressing need calls for it (4). A man has no business plunging into that which does not concern him in the science of kaldm (5). Some people simply are not qualified to do so (6), and therefore should abstain from using it. Only those who are capable of handling it should make use of it when the need calls for it (7). One of the most persistent types of sayings attributed to the Ancestors, especially Shafi'i, is that kaldm should be avoided as a plague. Subki goes along with this. He agrees that the Ancestors did indeed mean to enjoin the faithful from plunging into the submerging waters (khaud) of kaldm. But once the above two criteria, qualification and need, are present, then kaldm must be used by reason of orthodoxy's need for it. Here is one of the ways in which he expresses himself on this point: "discourse in matters of kalam, when necessary, is (1) See Tabaqat, II, 281: "wa-hddhd [=al-hadlfh] wa-amthdluhu mimmd ruwiya fl dhammi 'l-kaldm wa-qad ruwiya md yu'driduh".

(7) MuhasibT, for instance; op. cif., II, 39-40, and Shafil, whom SubkI represents as a highly accomplished expert on kaldm, op. cit., I, 241. 61</page><page sequence="26">obligatory (wajib); whereas holding one's tongue from it, in the absence of need, is meritorious (sunna)" (1). It may be pointed out here that Subkl is addressing himself to Shafi'ite lawyers and that the terms used for obligatory and good are legal terms. An act termed obligatory (wdjib) is one of which the observance is rewarded and the neglect punished; and an act termed meritorious (sunna) is one of which the observance is rewarded, but of which the omission or neglect is neither blamed nor punished. This makes it possible to indulge in kaldm at all times without any harmful effects. It takes the danger out of kalam. The definitions that Subki gives to a mutakallim and to an Ash'arite are very broad. A mutakallim is one who has defended orthodoxy; in the same manner as an Ash'arite is one who has defended Ash'arl. That is why we may find the very fathers of traditionalism themselves included among the mulakallimun in Subki's scheme ; it also explains the presence of traditionalists, some known to be anti-Ash'arite, among the Ash'arites (2). (1) Op. cil., 11, 12: "fa 'l-kalamu f 'l-kaldmi 'inda 'li 'ftiiydji wajibun wa 's-sukflu 'anhu 'inda 'adani 'li 'l hiytTji sutina'. (2) It is easy for Subkl to include undler the denomination of "Ash'arite" those who were strictly traditionalist, followers of the Salaf, the pious ancestors. For he explains that Ash'arl did not really found a new school of thought; he merely took up the beliefs of the Salaf and defended tlem with reasoned arguments. Whoever imitated Ash'arl in the use of proofs, upholding the beliefs of the Salaf, became an Ash'arite. (Tabaqdl, I1, 254-255). An Ash'arite is thus by definition: a follower of Ash'arT, a follower of the Salaf; he is also a user of kalam as a method. Proceeding further (op. cil., II, 255), we find Subkl asking his father ("ash- Shaikh al-Imam", d. 756) why Ibn 'Asakir, in listing the various generations of Ash'arites (in his Tabyin), named so few of them. Iis father told him that Ibn 'Asilkir limited himself to those who were known to have fought in his defense; otherwise, his father continued, it is true that the majority of the learned men of the various schools of law are in agreement with Ash'arl (...ghaliba 'ulamd'i 'I-madhdhibi mna'ahu). Subkl'd father then tells him that he once came across a work by a Mu'tazllite entitled Tabaqdl al-nmu'lazila, the first biographical notice of which was devoted to 'Abd Allah b. Mas'fid (famous Companion of the Prophet; for lis collected traditions see Ahmnad b. l.lanbal, Musnad (6 vols.; Cairo: Maimanlya Press, 1313/1895) I, 374 (line 1.1)-4G6; died 32 or 33/653 or 65.1; sec Encyclopedia of Islam, s. v.). Subkl told his father: if thie Mu'tazilites could do this, the Ash'arites could claim Abf Bakr and 'Umar (first two Caliphs, died, respectively, in the year 131634, and 231644). Subkl's father then tells him that "a man's followers are those who follow him in his body of tenets and profess his doctrines by way of following and imitating, 62 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="27">ASH'ABi AND THE ASH'ARITES The mulakallims are orthodox, according to Subki. He shows this by the way he refers to them as Ahl al-din, a variant of his for Ahl al-kaldm; on the analogy of usul al-dTn, as a variant for usul al-kaldm (1). The mulakallims are those who expose the false boctrines of heretics, and upon whose expositions other rank and rile mulakallims depend, in order to refute the heretics (2). For it is kalam that defeats the mu'tazilites (3). Kaldm complements fiqh, and fiqh, without kaldm, is inadequate for defending and explaining religion (4). By the same token Ash'arites are experts on traditions, law, or kalam, or on all three sciences together (5). Ash'arI is the great defender of orthodoxy (6). Ash'arism not only defends which is more intimate than being in agreement; for there is a great difference between following and being in agreement" ("albd'u 'I-mar'i man dana bi-madh- habihi wa-qdla bi-qaulihi 'aia sabili 'l-muldba'ali wa-li 'qtifa'i 'lladhl huwa akhassu mina 'I-muwafaqa; fa-baina 'I-mulaba'ati wa 'l-muwdfaqati binun 'a;fm." Op. cit., II, 255, lines 14-15). There is, in fact, a Mu'tazilite biographical work, recently published, which cites as the first class (!abaqa) of Mu'tazilites, the first four Caliphs, followed by the "six greats" among the Companions of the Prophet, Ibn Mas'cd being one of them. (See Ahmad b. Yahyi b. al-Murtadid, T'abaqil al-mu'tazila, ed. S. Diwald- Wilzer. Beirut: Imprimerie Catholique, 1961.) While Ibn 'Asakir, inhis Tabyin, and SubkI, in his Tabaqal, do not go this far, they do include in their lists Shffi'ites, such as Abu Ishiq ash-ShirfizI (d. 476 1i.), Abfi 'Umar b. 'Abd al-Barr (d. 463 H.), and AbC Tihir as-SilafI (d. 576 HI.), and other traditionalists who do not rightly belong there. Subkl, in adding names to Ibn 'As5kir's list as Ash'arites who should not have been omitted, goes so far as to include the celebrated Hanbalite, Ab0'l- Wafi' b. 'AqIl (d. 513/1119; see George Makdisi, "Nouveaux details sur l'affaire d'Ibn 'Aqll", in Melanges Louis Massignon [3 vols.; Damascus: Institut Frangais de Damas, 1956-57], III, 91-126) who was one of the foremost foes of Ash'arism in his day, as may be seen in the chronicles and biographical works dealing with the period, as well as in Ibn 'Aqil's own works, extant in manuscript. (See Tabaqdl, II, 258, line 18). (1) Cf. Tabaqat, I, 197. (2) Op. cit., I, 252. (3) Cf. op. cit., II, 51-2. (4) See op. cit., III, 53, Ibn Firak's reason for studying kaldm.

Appeal to Shdfi'ites on Behalf of Ash'arism Lest it be thought that Subki has no respect for the other sciences, especially those held high in the estimation of the traditionalists, it cannot be over-emphasized that he insists on the importance of traditions and law. As mentioned previously, he states this quite plainly in the introduction to his book, describing it as being a work on "traditions, law, history and literature" (2), and later repeats this description in the same terms (3). Then he goes on to show the importance he places upon traditions by quoting two verses of Shafi'i on the importance of this science (4). Further on, he beseeches the carrier of these heavy volumes of his work not to deem them heavy by reason of the copiousness of the traditions they contain, for these traditions are the beauty and brightness of the book and the adornment of its author (5). Subki then (1) In doing so, these converts from Mu'tazilism were only following the supreme example of Ash'arl himself. Subki delights in citing Shafi'ite jurisconsults who were Mu'tazilites and converted to Ash'arism; cf. the case of al-Qaffal ash- Shashi (d. 365 I.), Tabaqdt, II, 177 (lines 3 ff.). As for other Shafi'ites who were Mu'tazilites, or with strong Mu'tazilite tendencies, Subki cites these without comment; cf. the case of MAiwardi (d. 450 H.), op. cit., III, 304 (lines 19 ff.). (2) Op. cit., I, 109 (line 14). (3) Op. cif., I, 176 (line 2). (4) Subkl, preoccupied by the fact that these two verses sing highly in praise of traditions, may have overlooked the fact that they were in censure of kalam. It is, of course, possible that he may have wittingly cited them in hopes of changing their import by the very fact that he himself had endorsed them. But in either case, the danger of interpreting them in censure of kaldm is apparent.-Here are the verses (basit): kullu 'l-'ulumi siwd 'l-Qur'dni mashghalalun ilid 'l-iadilha wa-ill 'l-flqha fl 'd-dini Al-'ilmu mad kdna flhi "qdla: haddalhand..." wa-md siwa dhdka waswdsu 'sh-shaydatni. (All sciences other than tlat of the Koran arc a distraction / Except tradition and knowledge of the religious law / True religious science is that which contains: "he said: So and So lias related to nc..." [=-the beginning of a tradition's chain of transmitters] / All else is but the wicked whispering of devils). See Tabaqdl, I, 157. (5) Op. cit., I, 167 (lines 9 if.). 64 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="29">ASH ARI AND THE ASH 'ARITES gives the chains of transmitters (isndd) of the traditions used in his book. These chains contain the names of the important traditionists, and include a certain number whom Subki will later attack, in another context. These include, among others, the anti-kalam, anti-Ash'arite Ibn Hazm of the Zahirite school of law, Dhahabi of the Shafi'ite school, and Ibn Taimiya of the Hanbalite school; all three of whom are known by their writings to be anti-kaldm, anti-Ash'aritc (1). Subki seizes every opportunity to point out in his biographical notices that some Shafi'ite was a great traditionist as well as a great jurisconsult. But it soon becomes apparent that these men who combined both of these sciences were also mulakallimun. He introduces Abu Bakr b. Ishaq ad-Dab'I as "one of the Im5ms who have united the knowledge of law with that of traditions" (2). The verb united has also the explicit meaning of reconciled, conciliated. But this is not all that this great Shafi'ite scholar has done. On the following page of the biographical notice, we find that his works on law are one of the most decisive proofs of his religious knowledge, "and his works on kaldm none of the doctors of the People of Tradition (Ahl al-Hadith: the Traditionalists) has preceded him to the like of them" (3). Thus great Shafi'ites were, to begin with, traditionists and speculative theologians as well as jurisconsults. Then, the fact of their knowledge of speculative theology was a matter to boast of as much as the fact of their knowledge of law. And finally, the great doctors among the traditionalists not only took up kaldm (unthinkable, for a traditionalist), but vied with one another in the pursuit of it. A familiar saying of the traditionalist jurisconsults, who wished to keep the fledgling students of law away from the study of kaldm, was to warn them that preoccupation with this science, which was censured by the Ancestors and which was involved and complex to boot, would keep them from succeeding in their legal studies. To counter this saying, Subki quotes on (1) For the chains of transmitters, see op. cil., I, 167-169. (2) Op. cil., II, 81 (line 5). (3) Op. cil., II, 82 (lines 10-11) :"wa-musannafaduhu fL 'I-kaldmi lam yasbuqhu ila mithliha alhadun min mashayikhi Ahl al-Hadllh." 5 65</page><page sequence="30">the authority of a distinguisllcd Shafi'ite jurisconsult, Ibn Suraij, the following rejoinder: "I hlave not seen a student of law go into the study of kalim, and succeed, whom law passed beyond and who did not attain the knowledge of kalam." (1). Now this statement may be cited in more ways than one so as to convey an anti-kaldm message. For instance, "I. have not seen a single student of law go into the study of kalam and succeed"; or "I liave seen those who have gone into the study of kaldm whom law passed beyond and who did not attain the knowledge of kaldm". Both of these sayings may be arrived at without the use of any additional words; the first, simply by quoting the first part of the saying, the second by suppressing certain words. It may be thought that some one had altered these anti-kaldm sayings so as to render them favourable to kalndm. But it is just as likely to think that the saying is authentic and had been tampered with to render it harmful to kalaim. Subki was very likely quite aware of both possibi- lities, just as he wanted hlls reader to be aware thlat there were traditions attributed Lo Sllihi'i vliicll were anti-kalrm, and that tliere were others wliich were pro-kalam and contradicted these. The present case is an example of one of the latter, and subtely indicates that Subki believed that these authentic sayings in favor of kaldin supplied unscrupulous traditionists with the raw materials of their fabricated traditions. For Subki has pointed out that the "anthropomorphists", an appellation he applies to the traditionalist Hanbalites, do not hesitate to lie in order to defend their system of thought, nor do they hesitate to tell lies against those who do not follow their system (2). But back to Subkl's quotation wliich had a special message for jurisconsults. The message is that law simply cannot go beyond kaldm (and therefore be superior to it); for it is kaldm which goes beyond law. In the hierarchy of the religious sciences, kaldm occupies a liglher level than law. So that it (1) Op. cil., II, 89 (lines 3-4): "md ra'ailu mina 'I-mulafaqqihali mani 'shlaghala bi 'l-kalimi fa-aflaha yafTiluhu 'l-fiqhti wa-ld yasilu ild ma'rifali 'l-kalam." (2) Op. cit., I, 192-193 (last line of 192 and first two lines of 193). 66 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="31">ASIIHARI AND THE ASII'ARITES is nonsense to say that, in studying kalam, one is in danger of having law pass beyond him, as though law could go beyond kalam! In fact, if the saying be fully understood, to have studied kalam, and succeeded, assumes a prior success in the study of law; so that an unsuccessful student of law could not possibly hope to succeed in kaldm,-he does not have the necessary amount of intelligence. It is therefore quite plain that a mulakallim-jurisconsult is quite an able jurisconsult indeed; not one who just barely made the grade. That Subki presents things in such a light is illustrated in an anecdote which he cites in the biographical notice devoted to the Shafi'ite mulakallim Abi Bakr b. Furak (d. 406 H.). According to this anecdote, Ibn Furak decided to study kalam when he was a student of law in Isbahan. He had heard a tradition the meaning of which he did not know. The tradition was: The stone [=the black stone, or ka'ba, in Mecca] is the right hand of God (1). He went to his teacher of law and asked him the meaning of the tradition but did not receive a satisfactory answer. Someone then sent Iiim to a mulakallim who gave him such an answer. He decided then and there that he had to learn the science of kalam.-Not only does this anecdote serve to illustrate the superiority of kalan over fiqh; it also serves to show that kalam, far from being inimical to tradition, is in fact so intimately familiar with it that it is highly capable of elucidating its mysteries (2). It would therefore behoove every Shafi'ite jurisconsult, who is intellectually qualified, to take up this worthy religious science. Shafi'i himself was highly gifted in the science of kalam; though, of course, he knew of its dangers. Subki illustrates this in an anecdote where Shafi'i is supposed to be warning Muzani against its dangers. At first blush, the anecdote sounds as though it were supporting a traditionalist anti-kalam view. But this is not so, since Shafi'i, after issuing his warning, proceeds later to make use of kalam in order to explain some (1) Cf. Jalal ad-Dln as-Suyutl, al-Jami' as-saghir, ed. M. Muhyl'd-dln 'Abd al- Hamid, 2 vols. (Cairo: HijazI Press, 1352/1933), 1, 516 (nos. 3804-05). (2) Tabaqdt, III, 53 (lines 6 ff.). 67</page><page sequence="32">difficult matters. The message Subki succeeds in giving is that Shafi'i is against the use of kaldm, except in dire need, and then, only by those who can handle it like himself. This naturally means that the number of mulakallimun will always be relatively small, and that the great majority of Shafi'ites will be jurisconsults who, if they cannot aspire to that science and master it, should not stand in the way of those who can (1). Just as Shafi'i was a highly qualified expert on kaldm, Ash'arl, the Imam of orthodox kaldm, was himself a Shafi'ite. This is a point on which Subki strongly insists. He does so on the authority of two other Shafi'ites, who also happen to be Ash'arite doctors of kaldm: Abi Bakr b. Furak (d. 406 H.), in his Tabaqdt al-mulakallimin (2), and Abi Ishaq al-Isfara'ini (d. 418 H.), as cited by Ab Muluhammad al-Juwaini (d. 438 H.; Imam al-Haramain's father) in his Sharh ar-risdla (3). These two Ash'arite mulakallinmun affirm that Ash'ari was a Shafi'ite and studied law under the direction of the Shafi'ite Abui Ishaq al-Marwazi. Some people had said that Ash'ari was a Malikite (4). This is erroneous. The Malikite, explains Subki, was Abu Bakr b. al-Baqillani, an Ash'arite whom SubkI holds in very high regard (5). The Shafi'itc school of law can therefore claim priority in the field of "orthodox" kalam by reason of the Shafi'ism of Ash'arl himself. Thus, as Subki sees it, Shafi'ism and Ash'arism have been inseparable from the start. It was therefore in the Shafi'ite school of law, according to (1) Op. cil., I, 241 (lines 2 ff.). (2) For this work, which is still lost to us, see lCashf, II, 1106. (3) Meaning, perhaps, tile Risdla of Shflfi'T which has had many commentaries, see Kashf, I, 873, where, however, JuwninI is not cited, perhaps because of the lacuna in the text. This work of JuwainT is cited by Subkl again in the notice he devotes to Juwainl (see 7'abaqSl, Ill, 209, line 10), not to be confused with his Tafstr (ibid., lines 19-20), wliicll latter is the work usually cited by the biographers. (4) On1 this, see Tabyin, 117. Incidentally, Ibn 'As5klir points out that Ash'arl was claimed by some as a; MNlikite and by others as a Shafl'ite. Ilis own feeling is that he was neither, and that lie owed allegiance to no particular school, speaking, as he did, for orthodoxy in general. The modern eclitor of the Tabyin, the late Slinikh al-Kautlhar, whose sympathies were clearly Asll'aritc and anti-.lanbalite, believes that Ash'arl was a Ilanafite, basing this on Mas'ud b. Sharba's Kildb al-ta'llm (see 'Abd al-Q5idir b. AbI 'l-Wafa', al-Jawahir al-mudlya, II, 169, and Kashf, 1405; this work is not extant) as copied by later authors. (5) See Tabaqdl, II, 248 (line 17); sec also, op. cit., II, 255 (lines 19 ff.). 68 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="33">ASTHARi AND THE ASII'ARITES Subki, that Ash'arism was born. Since then Ash'arism and Shafi'ism have walked hand in hand, their destinies commingled. History gives proof of this. Witness the times of trouble, especially in 445. Then it was that the Great Saljuqid Tugril Beg, advised by his Mu'tazilite Minister Kundurl and the Mu'tazilites, ordered the public cursing of Ash'ari from the pulpits; thus were treated contemptuously "the Shdfi'ile school in general and the Ash'arites in particular" (1). There can hardly be any doubt that Subki was engaged in Ash'arite propaganda aimed straight at the Shafi'ite school of law. Much more could be given in support of this view from Subki's own work. However, we will confine ourselves to this last and very important reference. Subki, in recommending Ibn 'Asakir's Tabyln to his readers, does so by coining two statements which could be said of this work, a work which he considered to be highly praiseworthy. First, he states that "Every Sunnite who does not have Kitdb al-Tabyin of Ibn 'Asakir lacks knowledge and assurance as to his own good"; and secondly, that "A jurisconsult is not truly a Shafi'ite until he has digested Kitdb al-TabyTn of Ibn 'Asakir". Subki then continues by saying that his professors used to order their students to study the book (2). Such was their advice to their students. In his turn, Subki meant to leave the same kind of advice, including these two statements, to be handed down to orthodox posterity, in general, and to the Shafi'ite one, in particular (3). These statements may be considered as Subki's supreme effort on behalf of Ash'arism. If they have in them a touch (1) Op. cil., III, 86, II, 270 (lines 16-17) and III, 86 (lines 9-10). It is true that those who were mistreated were Shafi'ites, but they were the recipients of such treatment because of their Ash'arism. (2) Op. cit., II, 248 (lines 11 ff.). Cf. Kashf, 342; W. Spitta, Zur Geschichte Abu'l-.Hasan al-As'ati's, II (citing Kashf). (3) The Damascus edition of Ibn 'Asaikir's Tabyin carries only the first statement on the title page, cited by Father R. J. McCarthy, Theology, 146 (English Text); just as the Ash'arite Muhammad Zahid al-KautharI had quoted only the first statement to the editor of the Tabygn, see Tabyin, title page and the first page of "muqaddimal an-ndshir". 69</page><page sequence="34">of emotion and exaggeration, the reason for this may be seen in what Subkl has to say about his Shafi'ite teacher Dhahabi. For Dhahabt too had endorsed Ibn 'Asakir's Tabyin, but not quite in the same manner, nor with the same intentions, nor for the same group of people. Dhahabi endorsed the Ash'arite Tabyitn as good for Ash'arites alone, and this he did in quite a subtle way. In his own biographical notice on Ash'ari, Dhahabi had referred the reader to the Tabytn in the following manner: "He who wishes to go deep into the knowledge of Ash'ari should then stick to Kitab tabyin kadhib al-muflari of Abi'l- Qasim b. 'Asakir". Dhahabi had no such wish, nor did he advocate Ash'arism for any other Shafi'ite. For Dhahabi, master of allusive comment, adds the following prayer of deliverance from such temptation immediately after that specious recommendation: "0 God! Take Thou our soul and cause us to die while in the state of orthodoxy; and cause us to enter into Paradise; and cause our souls to be in a state of rest. We love Thy saints because of Thee; and we hate Thine enemies because of Thee; and we beseech forgiveness on behalf of the rebellious among Thy servants. We act according to the unambiguous verses of Thy Book; and we believe in Its ambiguous verses; and we describe Thee according to Thine own description of Thyself." (1). In this brief prayer, laden with allusions born of centuries of religious polemic, may be found the essence of the traditionalist creed in its unrelenting fight against rationalism; in this case, Ash'arite rationalism. This prayer, as one can well imagine, fairly drives Subkl to the point of desperation (2). Obstacle in the Path of Ash'arism For Subki, Dhahabi was traditionalism incarnate. In him, Subkl saw traditionalism's stubborn resistance against, and crushing impact upon, the progress of Ash'arism. Small (1) Tabaqat, II, 248 (last four lines). (2) See op. cit., II, 248-249. 70 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="35">ASH'ARI AND THE ASIHARITES wonder, then, that Dhahabi should be Subki's enemy. Never- theless, there is good cause for wonderment at the special treatment which Dhahabi receives at the hands of Subki as compared with that accorded all other traditionalists. The re- doutable Zahirite Ibn Hlazm (d. 456 H.),who vehemently censures Ash'arl and Ash'arism, is barely recognized by Subkl (1). The kaldm-censuring HIanbalite mystic Ansari HIarawi (d. 481 H.) is only briefly censured (2). Even Ibn Taimiya (d. 728 H.), whose anti-rationalist polemics shook the very foundations of Ash'arism in Damascus, in the generation just previous to Subkl's, receives the same cursory treatment (3). But Dhahabi was a case all by himself. Not because he was more traditionalist than the others. Not because he was a more formidable polemist. But rather because he was a highly respected Shafi'ite, and therefore a most redoutable obstacle to the progress of Ash'arism within the Shfi'ite school. In his struggle against Dhahabi, Subki had to operate under appalling restrictions. For this was not a case of arousing the 'asabiya, or esprit de corps, of one school against another: both he and his enemy were members of the same Shafi'ite school. This situation imposed terrible restrictions on Subkl, restrictions which Dhahabi did not have when attacking Ash'arism. Subkl was aware of these restrictions and invoked them to keep Shafi'ites, i.e. traditionalist ones, from attacking other Shafi'ites, i.e. Ash'arite-Sh fi'ites. In support of this he cites the traditionalist Ibn 'Abd al-Barr (d. 463 H.) who, in his Kildb al-'ilm, opposes quarrels between men of religious science, the 'ulamd' (4). This could be a reason for the highly developped art of allusion among them (such as is used by Dhahabl) when in disagreement on matters of theology. But the traditionalists had arrived at a good excuse for attacking the Ash'arites and other rationalists. They agreed that the 'ulamd' should be (1) Tabaqdt, I, 43 (line 5); III, 54 (line 15) and 55 (line 6); IV, 10 (line 22). (2) Op. cit., II, 141 (line 22); III, 117 (line 5); IV, 19 (line 20).

The Ash'arites, who were mulakalliman, were thus stripped of their immunity and made easy prey for traditiona- lists. Subki tried to put the mulakallimun back in the ranks of the 'ulama'; but all he could do to support his case, was to cite his own father (1) whose testimony could hardly influence the traditionalists, being himself a mutakallim. Dhahabl was an obstacle which could not be by-passed. His testimony had to be discredited. This, Subki attempted to do from one end of his work to the other, at every opportune moment. He defended the Ash'arites on grounds of defending the truth, implying that Dhahabi had attacked the truth. But this could have little effect on a Dhahabi who was universally considered, in and out of his school, as highly trustworthy. Shafi'ite posterity did not look kindly upon Subki's attack. It showed its disapproval by mentioning, in the biographical notices it devoted to Subki, that Dhahabi was his teacher and that "Dhahabi had mentioned him in al-Mu'jam al-muhlass and had spoken well of him." This was an unusual thing for a master to do with regard to his pupil and indicative of high regard (2). Posterity was to contrast the magnanimity of the master with the later ingratitude of the pupil. Dhahabi was not the only Shafi'ite who stood in the way of Ash'arism. He was only one Shafi'ite among many others in the powerful traditionalist movement within the Shafi'ite school of law. Other anti-Ash'arites had preceeded Dhahabi upon the scene and, before leaving it, they had carefully (1) Tabaqdt, I, 58 (line 20). Subki refers to his father here as ash-Shaikh al- Imam, author of Sharh al-Minhaj. For the author, see GAL, Suppl. II, 102-104, and for his work, see op. cit., Suppl. II, 103, no. 20. This Sharh, or commentary, is on the famous work of Nawawl, entitled Minhdj atl-alibin (op. cil., Suppl. I, 680, no. 1). Subkl's father died (756/1355) before completing the commentary; he had reached as far as the chapter on divorce (!aldq) and had entitled the work al-Iblihdj (rhyming with the original work, al-Minhdj). Subkl's brother, Baha' ad-Din Ahmad (died 773/1371) completed the work. See Kashf, 1873, cf. GAL, Suppl. I, 680. (2) Shadharat, VI, 221 (lines 3-4 from bottom). The Mu'jam al-mukhlas.s is one of the sources of Nu'aiml in ad-Ddris fi tdrikh al-maddris (see index in vol. II, sub verbo Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Qaimaz at-Turkumanl adh-Dhahabl (d. 748 H.), pp. 743-745, passim). 72 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="37">ASH ARi AND TIIE ASII'ARITES registered their thoughts in a number of treatises, theological and historical, urging the Shafi'ite posterity to beware of the Ash'arite menace. It was this posterity that Subki had to discredit, along with his teacher Dhahabi. In the introduction to his work, Subki gives a list of former Shafi'ite biographers (1). This list has been taken as a citation by Subki of his sources (2). But to regard this list as a mere listing of sources is to miss the point completely. It will be remembered that Subki had described his book as one on tradition, law, history and adab-literature (3). In this description, he affirms having given complete justice to each individual biographical notice, according to the method of traditionists and adab writers (4). After praising his work highly (6), he humbly confesses its shortcomings (6), and parti- cularly asks God's forgiveness, as well as that of his readers, for what his pen had perpetrated, meaning by way of matters controversial (7). The stage thus being set, Subki proceeds to enumerate previous !abaqdt writers of the Shafi'ite school. One has only to read this section to understand that the author is dissatisfied with the work that had been done. And the need for a new bio- graphical work on the Shafi'ites becomes obvious. This need must be fulfilled for one or more of the following reasons. Previous biographical works arc not extant; or extant only in abbreviated forms of the originals; or they deal with Shafi'i and a few other Shafi'ites only; or the biographical notices are brief; or they deal with obscure individuals; or they do not limit themselves to Shafi'ites, but treat also of jurisconsults of other schools of law; or, finally, highly important Shafi'ites are passed over in silence (8).

It is, of course, certain that he made use of them; but, by reason of their 73</page><page sequence="38">SubkI's enumeration and analysis of previous works shows a thoroughness worthy of high admiration. But in this enumeration and analysis there is more than meets the eye at first glance. Subki meant to discredit specific works for a specific reason; but nowhere does he say so specifically. His reason, I believe, was that these works, and their likes, did not present the case of Shafi'ite Ash'arism. They did not, because they were written by traditionalists. All traditionalists oppose rationalism. Some do so by passive resistance. A tradi- tionalist biographer of this type would pass over in silence a controversial subject for reasons of prudence. Though he opposes a colleague's ash'arism, he still identifies himself with him as a Shafi'ite. Other traditionalist biographers, because of their militant traditionalism, are actively hostile and pro- vocative. From his list of former biographers, Subki singled out two specific works for special comment. These works were written by Shafi'ites of the highest eminence. For this reason, they could do great harm to the Ash'arite cause in the Shafi'ite school of law. The first of these two works is that of Abui Ishaq al-Shilrzi, Tabaqad al-fuqahd (1). It contains biographies of jurisconsults deficiencies from his own point of view, he supplemented them with other works not mentioned at all in this list, works which supplied him with information on Ash'arite Shafi'ites and the Ash'arite movement. Of these, we will make particular mention of Tdrikh Ntsdbiar by al-I:H.kim an-NIsbfrli (d. 404/914; cf. GAL, Suppl. I, 277, lines 6-7, where Brockelmann mentions that Subkl made use of it;-see Subkl, Tabaqdl, III, 137, line 22, as a source on the Ash'arite Abu Ishiq al-Isfara'ini [d. 418 H.]) and its continuation by Abf 'l-lHasan 'Abd al-Ghafir al-FarIsl (d. 529/1134), entitled as-Siyaq li-lar[kh Nisadbr (GAL, Suppl., I, 623). On Subkl's use of the latter work, see for example, Tabaqdl, III, 131 (where the Siydq is used as a source on Abu 'All al-Manl'I, see Muslim Institutions, 30, n. 1), III, 245 (on the celebrated mystic Abi 'l-QSsim al-Qushairl, d. 465 H., who wrote in defense of Ash'arl following the Salj0qid order to curse the latter in the year 445 H.), IV, 250 (line 15, where the title of the work is given, as-Siyaq; here it is used as a source on the Ash'arite propagandist AbQ Nasr al-QushairI (d. 514 H.) son of Abu 'l-Qasim, just mentioned) and IV, 251 (line 13, same biographical notice), IV, 255 (antepenult; biographical notice on the author 'Abd al-Ghafir, and full title of his work; as-Siydq li-Tdrikh Nisdbur).-Subkl made use of numerous other sources which I have come across in my readings of his six volume work, and none of which are mentioned on page 114 of vol. I. (1) For ShIrazI and his works, see GAL, I, 387, Suppl. I, 669-670; for his role 74 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="39">ASH ARi AND THE ASH'ARITES of all the schools of law up to Shirazi's day. It was not this general coverage that Subki objected to particularly, but rather that Shirazi should have found it necessary to write about all of these people of the different schools, "in spite of the great number of our [Shafi'ite] companions who came after Shaikh Abu Ishaq". By "Shaikh Abu Ishaq", Subki was, of course, not referring to the author himself, Shirazi, whose kunya was also Abu Ishaq, but rather to Abii Ishaq a'-Isfara'ini (d. 418 H.). This Isfara'ini is mentioned in Shirazi's work, but Shirazi had disposed of him in less than two lines, after first bringing out that Isfara'ini was a mutakallim (1). ShirazI thought much more of another Isfara'ini, the jurisconsult whose kunya was Abii Hamid (d. 406 H.), who was at the head of a long line of Shafi'ite jurisconsults in the eleventh century, and who was far from being a mulakallim (2). The other work which Subki singled out for special comment is one which was written by three great Shafi'ite jurisconsults before it was completed. Ibn as-Salah (3) had begun to write it and died before finishing it. Nawawi (4) revised it and added in the early history of the Nizamlya College of Baghdad, see MuAlim Institutions, 32 ff.; for his anti-ash'arism, see his work, Kitdb al-luma' fl uisui al-fiqh (Cairo: $ubaih and Sons Press, 1347/1928-29), 7 (line 13), 8 (line 17), 15 (lines 24 and 26), 18 (line 1), 46 (line 4); see also Ibn Rajab, Tabaqdl al-liandbila (ed.

The Colleges of law which had been under Raft' ad-Din ul-JllI (d. 642/1244) were, after the death of Raft', turned over to Ibn as-Salah who appointed professors to their chairs (op. cit., I, 189).

In illustration of his ascetic nature, it is said of him that he refused to accept the salary due him as incumbent of the professorship and would content himself with what food he received from his father.

This traditionalist ShSfi'ite jurisconsult and traditionist held the professorship of the Ashraflya College of Tradition for a period of 23 years (Ddris, 1, 35). He was succeeded by Subkl's father, T5qI 'd-DIn (d. 756/1355; GAL, II, 86-88, Suppl. 1I, 102-104) who is pointed out by Nu'aiml (Ddris, I, 35) as an expert on kaldm. Among Miizzl's students we find Subkl himself and the traditionalist ShAfi'ite historian, lbn Kathir. (On the latter see H. Laoust, "Ibn Katir historien", in Arabica, 11 (1955), 42-88.) Ibn KathTr was also the son-in-law of Alizzl (see Ibn Kathlr, Biddya, 14, 192; D&amp;,ris, I, 36).

(). Subki's objection to these three Shafi'ites is not so much their omission of some important figures of the Shafi'ite school of law. Such omissions occurred frequently in the biographical works of the day. To point out these omissions is to give a good reason for a more comprehensive biographical work such as his own. Subki's objection is more that of an Ash'arite- Shafi'ite historian against traditionalist historians. Shafi'ite biographical works with an evident traditionalist slant were all too plentiful. Subki intended to remedy this situation by slanting his history writing in the direction of Ash'arism. Throughout his work, Subki pursues his discrediting of traditionalist biographical works, the tabaqad as well as other types. Among those he criticizes we find not only his teacher Dhahabl, but also al-Khatib al-Baghdadi (d. 463 H.) (2), 'Abbadl (d. 458 H.) and Ibn'al-Najjar (d. 643 H.) (3). And he often makes use of one traditionalist historian in order to discredit another such historian (4). jurisconsults of the 5th/llth century, likewise known by the name of Ibn as- Sabbagh, and all from the same family: his father, Abc Tahir b. a$-$abbagh (d. 448/1057, see Tabaqdl, III, 79); his first cousin, paternal side, Aba Ghalib b. as-Sabbagh (d. 492/1099, see op. cit., III, 80); and his nephew, fraternal side, as well as son-in-law, AbC Mansur b. as-Sabbigh (d. 494/1100, see op. cit., III, 34-35). -Abu Nasr b. as-Sabb5gh was the first incumbent of the professorial chair at the Niziamlya College in Baghdad; on his rivalry with Abu Ishaq ash-ShlrAzI for this post, see Muslim Inslilulions, 32 fT.

But the forces of Ash'arism had been on the decline for too long. Subkl looked with nostalgia upon Ibn 'Asakir's time which, in comparison with his own, appeared to him as the golden age of Ash'arism (1). What had happened since that time was not calculated to settle the nerves of an Ash'arite advocate. For two centuries now, the experts on tradition, who were overwhelmingly traditionalist in creed, were in a very strong position. For whereas the science of traditions was heretofore a subsidiary science as taught in the exclusive legal institutions of the schools of law, now it had its own endowed institutions. The very first of these was called Ddr al-HIadTth an-Nuriya, after its founder Nur ad-Din Zanki (d. 569 H.). After Zanki, other men of power and influence followed suit. They had come to appreciate the stature and influence of the traditionists in the Muslim community, as they had already done so in the case of jurisconsults. The first professor of traditions to occupy the chair of the Nuriya was Ibn 'Asaklr (d. 571 H.) who was followed by his son (d. 600 I-.), both of whom were advocates of Asli'arism. But there were not many traditionists who, like them, were Ash'arites. And the Nuriya's last two known professors were among the greatest Shafi'ites of their day: Birzali (d. 739 H.) and Mizzi (d. 742 H.) (2), both of whom were fervent advocates of traditionalism. The advent of the exclusive schools of tradition (ddr al-hadith) eventually brought about a further strengthening of traditiona- lism. Heretofore, each school of law liad its own exclusive institutions wherein its own system of law was taught (masjid, madrasa). It attracted students because it afforded them financial security through scholarship funds derived from the income of its endowment. Law was first and foremost in the curriculum of the law college, and the jurisconsult occupied its one and only chair. Tlie otlier religious or auxiliary sciences (1) Op. cil., IV, 239 (lines 3-4). (2) Ddris, I, 112-113. 78 G. MAKDISI</page><page sequence="43">ASH ARi AND THE ASH'ABITES were of secondary importance. With the advent of the ddr al-hadlih, the expert on traditions comes into a position of importance as did the jurisconsult before him, in the masjid and madrasa. And students could now attend endowed colleges of tradition, where they received scholarship funds. Unlike the colleges of law, the colleges of tradition were unrestricted; for there were no recognized schools (systems) of tradition, as there were of law (Shafi'ite, IHanbalite, etc.). This unrestricted character of the colleges of tradition institutionalized a financially supported teacher-student relationship hitherto known only to the colleges of law. Henceforth, not only could a student study traditions under a professor of a different legal system (this he could already do in the mosques, jdmi' as well as masjid}, but he could also become the disciple and follower of such a professor in the new institution, financially supported as a student, and with an opportunity to become, in turn, a professor of traditions who now had the prestige of a professor of law. But the professor of traditions had an advantage over the professor of law. Whereas the latter belonged to one school of law and taught law to a student body which necessarily belonged to the same school as he did, the professor of traditions could teach a "mixed" student body, i.e. students from the various schools of law. For instance, a professor of traditions who belonged to the Hanbalite school of law, could have Shafi'ite disciples. In this way, HIanbalite traditionalism was able to bolster and strengthen Shafi'ite traditionalism against the common enemy: rationalism. An instance which was most unsettling to Shafi'ite-Ash'arites is the case of Ibn Taimiya (d. 728 H.). This renowned IIanbalite traditionalist was able to influence a long line of Shafi'ites among whom were: Birzali (d. 739 H.), Mizzi (d. 742 H.), Dhahabi (d. 748 H.) and Ibn Kathir (d. 774 H.) (1). (1) Others were: Taj ad-DIn al-FazfrI (d. 690 H.) and Abu 'l-Fath b. Saiyid an-Nas (d. 734. H). Subki deplores Ibn Taimlya's influence upon Birzall, Mizzi, Dhahabl, and their followers (see Tabaqdl, VI, 254, lines 13-15). 79</page><page sequence="44">G. MAKDISI If Ash'arism had triumphed in the middle ages, Ibn 'Asakir would have had no need to appeal to the Shafi'ite traditionalists in the 12th century; nor would Subki have needed to renew the appeal in the 14th; nor would traditionalism have kept on flourishing after it had defeated Ash'arism in Baghdad in the 11th. The very existence of such propaganda as Ibn 'Asakir's and Subki's is a clear indication that the Ash'arites were still struggling for recognition. For these propagandists were not representing ortliodoxy interested in attracting stray sheep to the fold; they were representing a group considered to be outside the limits of orthodoxy and desperately trying to get in. Ash'arites in theology, Ibn 'Asakir and Subki were also two representatives of the important Shlfi'ite school of law in their respective periods. These two Shafi'ites were fervent believers in Ash'arism which lacked nothing but legitimacy. The bid for legitimacy in Baghdad had already failed in the eleventh century, and traditionalism had won the day. The struggle for legitimacy was then transferred to Damascus. In order to succeed, our two Damacenes, Ibn 'Asakir and Subki, had the task of convincing the orthodoxy of their day, an orthodoxy ever clinging tenaciously to the traditionalism of the Ancestors (Salaf), that Ash'arism bore the Ancestors' stamp of approval. Muslim orthodoxy remained unconvinced. And after the "elucidations" of Ibn 'Asakir and Subli, two central problems remained as perplexing as ever; namely, the origins of Ash'arism and its early development.
