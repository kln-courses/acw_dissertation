BRAKHAGE Bureau of Sport F;sheries and Wildlife, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Man and the California Condor. By Ian McMillarl. 1968. E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York. 1968. l91pp.; one map; 28 photographs. $5.95. Ian McMillan is a rancher living in the Salinas Valley Oll the edge of the present range of the California Condor. Since boyhood he and his brother Eban have shared a keen interest in these gigantic birds and the wild and rugged wilderness areas responsible for their survival. In 196&gt;64, they were engaged by the Audubon Society to reappraise the status of the condor to determine what changes might have occurred since the find- ings of Koford in the 1940&gt;s. This book is an interesting account of their field survey, together with an extensive review of the early history of the species and of the many factors involved in the long and rather discouraging campaign to save it from extinction It seems that condors were never abundant, even in prehistoric times. Primitive man captured them for use in ceremonial rituals during which the birds were killed and the skin and feathers retained. Mc- Millan speculates that this intense persecution by man may have been the principal factor in shaping the evolution of the condor so that it can breed successfully only in remote wilderness areas free of human intrusion. In historic times the range of the species has rapidly constricted before the onslaughts of the white man with his guns, poison baits, and bulldozers. Lack of carrion is not considered a factor in the decline of the condor, since dead sheep and cattle occur in the area in abundant supply. Illegal shooting is still the principal factor in reducing the population of condors, but urban sprawl and expanding recreational activities in wilderness areas pose serious threats. The inept administration of the condor refuges by U. S. Forest Service officials, as documented by McMillan, indicates the need for drastic action at the federal level if these birds are to survive. A recent drive to have a dam built in Sespe Canyon, within ie condor refuge, was defeated in 1967, but the forces of &lt;&lt;progress" will no doubt return to this with increasing vigor. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in wildlife and wilderness conser- vation.-GEORGE E. HUDSON, Department of Zoology, Washington State University Pullman. Far more of these birds migrate down the eastern part of the Central Flyway and through the Mississippi Flyway. He also states that most "small" Canadas in the Central Flyway, winter on the Gulf Coast of Texas and Mexico. Many of them do, but an important number also winter in Colorado, Oklahoma, New lHexico, and upstate r s exas. The life history portion of the book is followed by an interesting chapter on the future of Canada geese. Goose managers generally agree that the bird's future is indeed bright. The breeding grounds are lightly stocked and, at the moment, they are not seriously threatened by man The birds have a great ability to survive. Hunting is an important factor) but it is the one most easily controlled by managers. There are serious prob- lems related to distribution and harvest, but these are far more likely to be solved than are the problems created by dwindling or deteriorating habitat. A number of technical errors were found in this chapter. On page 158, the author referred to the "substantial" breeding goose population at Horicon Refuge in Wisconsin, where none exists, and ignored the important nesting flocks at Seney Refuge in M;chigan. In the next paragraph, he suggests that full-winged young geese returned to the Trimble Management Area in Missouri to nest when, in factX they never left. On the following page, he stated that fewer than 30,000 Canadas remained in the Mississippi Valley Population in 1946. The accuracy of inventories in those years was not as great as todaya but most managers agree that the low point in 1946 was Ilear 50,000 birds. These are small errors in an otherwise fine evaluation of the history, status, and future of Canada geese. Perhaps more emphasis should have been placed on the concept of management by populations, and upon some of the more so- phisticated goose management techniques now being used The roll private individuals have played in goose management should have been recognized. The book ends with a brief entry into the field of sub-specific determination. The author has been careful in this area of great disagreement. He identifies in a general way the eleven subspecies recognized by most biologists. The author has bridged the gap which often exists between the scientific writer and the curious reading public. His writing style is personal with- out being anthropomorphic. He communicates ef- fectively and clearly. The book is well organized and well illustrated with 149 excellent photo- graphs. I enjoyed reading it, and recommend it</page></plain_text>
