<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. P. Peerenboom Natural law in the Huang-Lao Boshu I The much-trumpeted discovery of the ancient lost texts of Mawangdui, espe- cially the Huang-Lao Boshua, has contributed an important piece to the puz- zle of the classical Chinese intellectual tradition, making it possible to clarify the relations between the various schools and, in so doing, to challenge tradi- tional categorizations.1 One area which has witnessed renewed interest, and benefitted from the attention, has been early legal thought. The standard portrayal of Chinese jurisprudence has it that Chinese law is, with an allowance for the positive law of what has become known as the Legalist school (Fa Jiab), by and large Confucian natural law. A prominent spokesperson for this view, Joseph Needham, noting the consensus among modern Chinese jurists, declares: The Legalists laid all their emphasis on positive law, which was to be the pure will of the lawgiver. .... As against this the Confucians adhered to the body of ancient custom, usage and ceremonial, which. . . unnumbered generations of Chinese people had instinctively felt to be right-this was the lic, and we may equate it with natural law.2 Needham adds that while in the West "the ideas of natural law (in the juristic sense) and of the laws of nature (in the sense of the natural sciences) go back to a common root," the Chinese natural law tradition did not tap the laws of nature as its source.3 This portrayal is problematic on two accounts: the characterization of Con- fucianism as natural law, and the claim that the early Chinese did not ground natural law in the laws of nature. I will focus primarily on the latter, basing my remarks on Huang-Lao legal theory as represented in the Huang-Lao Boshu. First, however, a few words as to the former may be in order. Confucianism, properly understood as an ethical system which relies on the aesthetic judgment of exemplary persons (jun zid) who create an emergent order from the particular context rather than by appeal to universal ethical principles, cannot be construed as natural law understood in a strict found- ationalist sense.4 To be sure, 'natural law' means different things to different people. The label has been applied to such unlikely bedfellows as Plato, Hamurabi, Mohammed, Aquinas, Hobbes, Kant, Han Fei, and Shang Yang as well as to Confucius. In coming to terms with this slippery concept, many have found it helpful to contrast natural law with legal positivism. A key differentia is that the latter does not require the law to display any necessary relation to moral- ity to be valid. Hart, speaking for the legal positivist, captures the difference in "the simple contention that it is in no sense a necessary truth that laws R. P.

In examining the relation between morality and the law, one must further distinguish between foundational and pragmatic or coherence systems. The objective of the ethical reasoning process on a pragmatic or coherence view is to achieve an equilibrium between one's judgments and one's per- sonally and communally held moral beliefs or intuitions. The aim is to make one's system or web of beliefs (attitudes, interests, goals, and so forth) coherent by bringing one's ethical judgments into line with one's intuitions. Coherence theories are in this sense holistic. To justify one's position, one simply appeals to other beliefs in the web. There are no claims that one's beliefs correspond to objective reality, that one's theory "cuts at the joints of nature," that one's ethical principles correspond to objectively true principles existing in Nature or Platonic Heaven or some other nonhuman realm. Were someone to challenge one's beliefs, one could bring forth arguments and reasons which one believes to be persuasive in hopes of convincing the other person. But there are no guarantees of resolution. The conversation could continue until agreement is reached or break off with the parties agreeing to disagree. As Joel Feinberg, one of the leading exponents of coherence methodology, observes, foundational philosophers are likely to object to this approach: They will find no semblance of a complete moral system, no reduction of moral derivatives to moral primitives, no grounding of ultimate principles in self-evident truths, or in 'the nature of man,' the commandments of God, or the dialectic of history. . . . [One may] appeal... to all kinds of reasons nor- mally produced in practical discourse, from efficiency and utility to fairness, coherence, and human rights. But I make no effort to derive some of these reasons from others, or to rank them in terms of their degree of basicness.7 While coherence theorists look to all kinds of reasons to make their case- from pragmatic considerations of efficiency and utility to intuitions and to contextual considerations such as existing customs and political structures- natural-law theorists seek to base their arguments and their ethical system on firmer foundations. Natural law is often grounded in some ultimate source of value which is beyond further questioning; it is derived from some transcendent order or first principles which determine the human order and are discovered by hu- mans, not created by them to suit their purposes or to bring coherence to their system of beliefs. Natural law, unlike conventional or positive law, is often</page><page sequence="3">311 held to be universal and immutable; it does not change from context to con- text as the particular beliefs, customs, and social institutions change.8 Natural law is often the language of privileged vocabularies, of final vocabularies; it is the language of the Absolute Good, of Inalienable Rights, Divine Command- ments, and Categorical Imperatives. While Confucius believes there is a necessary linkage between law and morality-and hence rejects the minimum-separation thesis and the legal positivism of Hart-he is no foundationalist. He does not, as do many social contractarians since Hobbes, try to build a case for a legal system on the grounds that it is the rational choice given certain axiomatic assumptions about what humans are like by nature.9 Nor does he try to deduce the law from universal principles, either of pure reason or of the moral variety.10 In adjudicating legal claims, something he is loathe to do, Confucius does not appeal to divine commands.1 Nor does he claim, as in the Boshu, that juristic laws express objective laws of nature which the sage has discovered. Rather, the Confucian sage tries to harmonize the law with a particular soci- ety's values, practices, goals, and needs. In striving for an equilibrium among the conflicting interests which will reflect the highest possible degree of social harmony attainable given the particular constraints, the sage has the final word.12 His judgment is the court of last appeal. In this sense, Confucianism is ultimately a "rule of man," not a "rule of law." Legalism, on the other hand, at least that of Shang Yang and Han Fei Zi, is a rule of law. Indeed, their emphasis on public, impartial law can be seen in part as a reaction to the Confucian system, which, in granting the nobility a wide latitude of discretion, fostered an elitist class structure wherein the upper stratum was ruled by li and the lower by penal law.13 Such a concen- tration of power in the upper class was anathema to the Legalist attempt to consolidate power in the hands of the ruler. Some have argued that there is a "close parallel" between the Legalism of Han Fei and the Huang-Lao thought of the Boshu.'4 Yet Huang-Lao, while favoring an empire unified under a central authority and based on a rule of law, does not espouse the positive law of Han Fei and Shang Yang. Law in the Boshu is natural law. The laws governing the social order are not just politi- cally expedient techniques adopted to serve the paramount pragmatic consid- eration of securing and enhancing the autocratic powers of the sovereign, but are grounded in the impersonal and constant, rule-governed natural order. This foundational naturalism differentiates the legal theory of the Boshu from that of Shen Buhai and Shen Dao as well.15 II To demonstrate that the Huang-Lao thought of the Boshu represents natural law grounded in the constant and regular natural order, one must surely come to grips with Needham's argument to the contrary: namely, that the early</page><page sequence="4">312 Peerenboom Chinese did not conceive of the "laws of nature" in a physical-science sense and hence could not turn to the natural order as the basis for natural law. In all due fairness to Needham, he did not have available the Boshu text at the time he made this claim. Nevertheless, his statements are very broad- sweeping, speaking to the premodern Chinese intellectual tradition as a whole. Thus they would, it seems, pertain to all works of that period. Further, and more importantly, Needham does, in characterizing the Chinese tradition as organismic, have an important insight, but one which needs to be clarified and qualified. That the Boshu advances a natural-law theory which Needham believes to be incompatible with an organismic world view need not under- mine the validity of his position as a general characterization.16 It merely suggests that Huang-Lao jurisprudence represents a countercurrent within the history of Chinese intellectual thought. Needham approaches the issue of natural law and laws of nature from the perspective of his larger problematic of scientific development, or the relative lack of it, in China. To summarize his argument, he points out that in many Western traditions, such as Islam and Judaism, natural law and the laws of nature often flow from the same source: a divine lawmaker who made laws for all things to obey. It was not permissible for human law to run contrary to divine law, including the God-given laws of nature. He then states: In so far... as natural law came to be overwhelmingly dominant in China, and positive law reduced to a minimum, one would expect that so different a balance might have had important effects on the development of the formula- tion of the regularities of Nature in the natural sciences ... The stronger the role of natural law, the greater facility there might have been in conceiving of the Laws of Nature as a kind of inescapable natural li in which the whole non-human world concurred.17 China, however, did not develop scientifically. Why not? The reason, he suggests, is that they were not concerned with the laws of nature. He attributes this to the lack of a divine lawmaker, of an "autochtho- nous idea of a supreme being" to act as source for such laws. Further, and less understandably, this is also to account for their not making the move from natural law based on universal ethical principles-the Confucian li on Needham's reading-to natural law based on universal laws of nature.18 Needham is partially correct. The lack of a transcendent deity who lays down the law, thereby establishing a predetermined order with which humans must comply in their social order, is consistent with and encourages an orga- nismic cosmology. Nevertheless, despite the absence of this kind of deity, some Chinese, as Derk Bodde has meticulously demonstrated, did conceive of the laws of nature as transcendent and predetermined in the sense that they determined the cosmic order, including the human order, without being themselves determined by humans or the human order.19 This view underlies</page><page sequence="5">313 the naturalist foundationalism of the Boshu, in which natural law is based on the normatively transcendent, rule-governed natural order. Before defending this claim, however, perhaps I owe at least a few words in response to Needham's broader query as to the lack of scientific development in China, which becomes even more difficult to explain in light of my conten- tion that there were Chinese schools which emphasized the laws of nature. It should be pointed out, firstly, that there was a brief flourishing of scientific activity around the Early Han.20 However, one reason why it did not continue may very well be that the schools which looked on nature in this way did not endure. The Huang-Lao school fell from power during the reign of Han Wu Di. Yin Yang Five Phase thinking, in the sense of causal correlative cosmo- logy, which supported predetermined laws of nature, came under increasing attack during the Han by skeptics such as Wang Chong, and, with the re- emergence of Confucianism during that period, was reinterpreted in a more nonfoundational, mutually determining (tian ren gan yinge) organismic fashion by Dong Zhongshu.21 As pointed out above, Confucian law is not, pace Needham, natural law in a foundationalist sense. Rather than appealing to a predetermined order in the form of abstract, ahistorical, universal ethical principles, Confucianism stresses a dynamic, interactive, emergent sense of order understood as an achievement of harmony in a particular sociohistorical context. This pre- cludes the progression from universal ethical principles to universal laws of nature to natural law. In short, Confucianism sponsors a kind of organismic cosmology, which, as Needham has so painstakingly documented, is not as conducive to scientific development as the dominant Western conception of nature.22 III To make my case, I must demonstrate firstly that the Huang-Lao of the Boshu is, like Legalism, a rule of law, but that, secondly, unlike the latter's positive law, it is natural law grounded in foundational naturalism. The first part is relatively straightforward and unproblematic. The second part will require more work. I begin by showing that the social order is determined by the natural order. I do this by illustrating the central importance of the notion of compliance with the natural order, by citing selected passages which portray the laws of nature as the basis for the social order, and by arguing that the notion of a single, predetermined order supports the Boshu's dominant sociopolitical goal of an empire unified under the central authority of one ruler. I then argue, on the basis of textual evidence which depicts nature in terms of constant, impersonal standards, cycles, and processes, that the author does indeed conceive of nature in terms of predetermined laws, and that this undermines Needham's argument against natural law of the kind</page><page sequence="6">314 Peerenboom advanced in the Boshu.23 Finally, I show how, given the author's epistemolo- gy, it is possible for him to believe not only that general social institutions such as the legal system are grounded in the natural order, but that even specific laws reflect objective laws of nature. Rule of Law That the Boshu represents a rule of law is attested to by the prominent place given to faf (law) in the text.24 The first of the four sections is called Jing Fag, the first subsection is titled "Dao Fah," and the opening line is "Daoi gives rise to the laws."25 So impressed have some scholars been by the importance of fa that they have considered Huang-Lao in general and this work in par- ticular to be part of the Legalist school (Fa Jia).26 Still others, led by Qiu Xigui, have for similar reasons suggested that this text does not represent Huang-Lao Daoism but another school, which should be labeled Dao-Fa Jiai (Daoist-Legalism).27 While maintaining that Huang-Lao is actually something fundamentally different from the Legalism of Shang Yang and Han Fei, I do appreciate the point that law is sufficiently central to the respective systems to consider both Huang-Lao and Legalism rule-of-law philosophies. Indeed, the author of the Boshu states, "as for laws and measures, they are of utmost importance in effecting sociopolitical order. Moreover, where sociopolitical order is realized through laws and measures, it cannot be overturned."28 To this he adds, "in that there is a distinction between right and wrong, use the law to adjudicate between them."29 As with Shang Yang and Han Fei, great emphasis is given to the public dissemination and impartial application of the law.30 However, in the Boshu, impartiality means that the law applies even to the ruler.31 It is not simply a technique to be used by the ruler when expedient. Similarly, because punish- ments are not just tools for manipulating the people to serve the interests of the ruler, they cannot be as harsh as the ruler sees fit.32 They must have an ethical basis; they must be just and in keeping with the severity of the crime.33 Natural Law While there would seem to be little doubt that Huang-Lao represents a rule of law, what evidence do we have for calling it natural law? One clue is the primacy of the natural order over the social order. Some scholars, such as Gao Heng and Dong Zhian, have, on the basis of a few passages isolated from their context, asserted that man is actually the determining factor in that he can conquer or overcome nature.34 The dominant theme, however, is one of compliance on the part of humans with the natural order on pain of disaster, calamity, and the general misfortune pursuant to disorder. For instance, the Boshu, in direct opposition to Gao's and Dong's stance, states:</page><page sequence="7">315 Where one's achievements surpass the natural order, there will be punish- ments and executions. Where one's achievements fall short of the natural order, one will fade away without reputation. Where one's achievements coincide with the natural order, one's reputation will be fully established. As for the principle underlying human affairs: complying with it, one lives; pat- terning oneself on it, one succeeds; opposing it, one dies; deviating from it, [one is left without] reputation.35 The text abounds with phrases which bring out this relation: yin tiank (accord with heaven cum nature),36 yin tian shim (accord with heavenly timeliness/the natural seasons), yin shin (accord with the seasons/timeliness), jin tian ji? (fulfill the limits of the natural order), cheng yi quan heng, can yi tian dangP (weigh according to the standardized scales, align with the benchmark of the natural order), zhong tian liq (hit the principles underlying the natural order dead on), shun si shir (comply with the four seasons), and xun tian changs (follow the constancy of nature). Other phrases underscore the notion of compliance in a more general sense: shun daot (comply with the Way), zhi daou (hold fast to the Way), shun liv (comply with principle), and cha ming liw (investigate names and principles). Viewed from the opposite perspective, the Boshu castigates those who turn their back on the natural order (bei tian zhi daox), who lose or deviate from the Way (shi daoY) or principle (shi liz), who act contrary to or go against principle (ni liaa) or forms (ni xingab). Compliance, then, is the cornerstone to this philosophy. As the Boshu states, "contrariness and compliance are determined on the basis of the same dao but are different in principle. To understand thoroughly compliance and contrariness-this is called the guideline to the Way."37 This compliance en- tails that the social order, in its many dimensions, be based upon a preestab- lished natural order. We get a general statement of how this works in the subsection "Lun": The sun reliably rises and sets; north and south have their boundaries-these are the models for standardization. The moon reliably waxes and wanes; the cycle of advancement and withdrawal has its constancy-these are the models for calculation. The stellar formations have their quantifiable relations; never, moreover, do they deviate from their paths-these are the models for reliability... 38 More specifically, the operation of the government and the implementation of penal law are to be in keeping with the underlying natural processes: To commence governing with civil measures (wenac) and to round it out with military force (wuad) is the way of heaven and earth. For there to be the standard periods of the four seasons is the principle of heaven and earth. For the celestial bodies-the sun, moon, stars and constellations-to have their quantifiable relations is the guideline of heaven and earth. To be productive during three seasons and to harvest and execute during one season is the way of heaven and earth. Timely and determinate, the alternations of the four seasons continue without discrepancy or error.... As for principle in</page><page sequence="8">316 Peerenboom human affairs, it is preserved by acting in accordance with compliance and contrariness.39 The skeletal idea expressed here that the government must comply with the forces of nature is later fleshed out in terms of yin and yang. Many commenta- tors have singled out this grounding of governmental policy in the natural order of yin and yang, reflected in the complementary pairs of wen wu (civil and martial rule) and xing deae (punishments and magnanimity/rewards), as a salient feature of the Boshu.40 One point which has not been given the attention that it deserves, however, is the way in which foundational naturalism, as a metaphysics of a predeter- mined, single order, coincides with and lends support to the political agenda of many philosophers of the period from the late Warring States to the early Han.41 Perhaps the author, in an effort to buttress his political theory calling for a unified empire headed by a single ruler, turned to a metaphysics which would provide the foundations for such a view. At the very least, his found- ational naturalism proves very convenient in supporting the newly arisen landowners' attempts to justify the class differences inherent in his hierar- chical and centralized feudal system. As he puts it, "Heaven and earth have their constant norms;...the nobility and the lowly have their constant positions. "42 The Nature of Nature Before speculating further as to the relation between the author's meta- physics, political ambitions, and conception of law, we must back up a step and make certain that we are in fact dealing with a natural order conceived of in terms of predetermined laws of nature. That humans must comply with the natural order indicates that the natural order has a certain normative pri- macy, but what is the nature of this order? The portrait of nature painted by the Boshu is one of constancy. Nature has, as we have seen, its perpetual cycles, permanent processes, unchanging patterns, and fixed standards. The determinate character of the natural order is attested to by the author's previous statement that "heaven and earth have their constant norms. .. ." Elsewhere he adds that there is a constant way (heng daoaf) to heaven and earth, metaphorically depicts heaven as the con- stant trunk and earth as the branches, and says that the operations of the natural order are regular and reliable.43 Nature is, moreover, impersonal. In a statement redolent of Lao Zi and Xun Zi, he declares: "Heaven and earth are impartial; the four seasons continue unceasingly."44 To be sure, the author also speaks of tian sending down punishments, cala- mities, disasters, and the like, leading many to claim that tian is an anthro- pomorphic heaven similar, some go so far as to say, to Confucius' tian.45 But this statement of the Boshu's position, in addition to contradicting the de-</page><page sequence="9">317 scription of nature as impersonal, misses the fundamental thrust of the text as a whole. Disaster occurs not because an anthropomorphic heaven wills it, but be- cause there is an objective, proper order which is predetermined by the natu- ral order. Failure to comply with the natural order leads to disorder and even- tually misfortune. But this, for the Boshu, is not the result of some mysterious interaction between humans and heaven. Quite the contrary. It is an entirely understandable and commonplace result. Humans might temporarily be able to gain the upper hand over nature, but in the long run they will suffer for their abuses of the environment and the proper natural order. If, during a drought, one for commercial purposes diverts water from a lake to a river, a short-term financial gain might be won but in the end the damage to the ecosystem may be such that on balance one loses. Similarly, if a strongman uses his control of the military to serve his own interests to the detriment of the people, he may benefit for a while, but, as the text states, the people will eventually rebel. And "even though they may not be able to succeed for the moment, they are certain to do so by the time of their descendants."46 One need not, then, take the author's statements about tian sending down disasters as being any more indicative of an anthropomorphic conception of nature than the mundane comments of people today that "mother nature" is responsible for the latest natural disaster. The use of such seemingly anthro- pomorphic language need not entail an anthropomorphic world view. It is nothing more than a fafon de parler. We gain a better understanding of the text by paying less attention to such conventional phrases and more to the notion of compliance and what this tells us about the Boshu's conception of nature and law. Needham's Argument Reconsidered Viewed from the Boshu's perspective requiring compliance with a constant, impersonal natural order underlying the social order, Needham's objection that there are no laws of nature in the sense necessary to support natural law cannot be sustained. He argues that, given the organismic character of Chinese cosmology, although "law could not be said to be in non-human Nature... the laws of human society should be modelled on non-human Nature."47 While agreeing that the social order is based on the natural order, we must, in light of the above analysis of the Boshu, take issue with the first part of his statement. There are laws of nature. Nature is regular and reliable and guided by constant norms. It seems that Needham feels compelled to deny the status of laws of nature to any Chinese conception of the constant forces and principles of nature because of a confusion as to the relationship between these laws and organis- mic cosmology. He seems to think the existence of the former precludes the latter.</page><page sequence="10">318 Peerenboom He denies, for instance, the existence of the laws of nature in Chinese thought on the grounds that humans, as part of the cosmos, are not governed from outside but must obey the "internal necessity" of their own natures "in accordance with their positions in the greater patterns (organisms) of which they are a part."48 But Needham's metaphorical distinction between laws being in things or in nature, and hence external to things, is misleading here. The issue is not one of internality or externality but of conceptual primacy. To the extent that the natural order is primary, which is to say it requires compliance on the part of humans, one could, perhaps, say it is im- posed on humans "from outside." That is, it can be looked on as a transcen- dent order in the sense elaborated by Hall and Ames: "A principle, A, is transcendent with respect to that, B, which it serves as principle if the mean- ing or import of B cannot be fully analyzed and explained without recourse to A, but the reverse is not true."49 On this score, the Judeo-Christian concep- tion of God, Aristotle's Unmoved Mover, and Plato's Forms, as well as the Huang-Lao conception of nature as a predetermined order in which the social order is grounded, are all transcendent. It is helpful, however, to draw a further distinction between transcendence in a strong sense (chao jueah) and in a weak sense (chao yueai). The former suggests a radical ontological disparity or separation. The creatio ex nihilo cosmogonic paradigm of Genesis, in which God, ontologically distinct and temporally prior to the world, creates the world out of nothing, is perhaps the clearest example. The interpretation of Plato's Forms as external, existing in some ontologically independent realm, would be another instance of the strong sense, while the reading of Aristotle's universals as indwelling, internal to phenomena, though still teleologically predetermining, would be an exam- ple of the weak sense.50 Huang-Lao advances transcendence of the weak sense. In that it does not, therefore, entail a radical ontological separation between the source of the determining order and the human realm which complies with this order, it can still be construed in terms of an organismic cosmology. The order is certainly not derived from a deity outside of the system as a whole. Yet neither is it the interactive organismic cosmology of Confucius in which humans participate in defining the social and natural orders (the latter most notable with Dong Zhongshu); that is, we do not have in the Boshu a cosmology in which hu- mans are responsible for the creation and achievement of a social order which emerges out of their own aesthetic judgment rather than in accordance with preestablished principles. Nevertheless, this does not preclude one from look- ing at Huang-Lao as a variation of the tian ren he yiai notion where this is understood to embrace any kind of organicism, including a weak transcen- dent one.51 This distinction vitiates Needham's basic objection that natural law cannot for the Chinese be grounded in the laws of nature because their organismic</page><page sequence="11">319 world view prohibited such a conception. Indeed, to the extent that one can appreciate the wisdom of complying with nature in a broad sense, the Boshu's position that law as a general social institution is to be grounded in the objec- tive laws of nature may very well seem eminently reasonable. Certainly one would not want to pass laws requiring us to disobey the laws of nature. Closer examination, however, might give one pause. What does it mean to claim that a given legal system, much less specific laws, are grounded in objective laws of nature? Is this not, as critics of natural law since Bentham have claimed, just "nonsense on stilts?" After all, do we not ultimately need to rely on human interpretation? Surely the laws of nature do not just present themselves to us in a straightforward way or else many scientists would be out of business. It does not seem possible to get beyond the human perspective to some Archimedean point from which one can access the natural order and verify that one's theory "cuts at the joints" of nature. Even were that pos- sible, few if any would allow that one could then ipso facto read off from the face of the laws of nature the proper juristic laws. Fortunately, the Boshu does attempt to provide us with an epistemological account of this process. Though one may not find it convincing, it is instruc- tive to consider in that it not only further substantiates the claim that we are dealing with a foundational naturalism but provides as well one more impor- tant way of differentiating Huang-Lao from other schools. The Epistemology of the Boshu The basic epistemological method can be summarized as a progression from XUal to jingam to wu sian to shenao (or shen mingap) to jian zhi bu huoaq: that is, one proceeds from "emptiness" through "tranquility" to "elimination of per- sonal bias" and to "spiritual-like intuitive clarity,"52 which consists of the "apprehension and understanding without confusion" of the natural order, that is, the objective laws of nature variously cashed out in terms of dao, li, xing ming, or fa.53 The result is that one is able to wu weias, comply with the natural order, make punishments match the benchmark of heaven/nature, know the origins of fortune and misfortune, ensure that names correspond to reality, and so forth. In short, one will be able to govern properly. Thus the Boshu states:54 Where there is tranquility, there is equanimity; where there is equanimity, there is peace; where there is peace, there is purity; where there is purity, there is focus on the essence; where there is focus on the essence, there will be gnostic intuition (shen). The zenith of utmost gnostic intuition is to apprehend and understand (jian zhi) without confusion (53: 51b-52a). To thoroughly investigate names and principles as well as the beginning and the end is called penetrating the principle. Only where one, being fair-minded and without personal bias, is not deluded in his apprehension and understand- ing, will he know how to get on with business. Consequently, the one who</page><page sequence="12">320 Peerenboom holds fast to dao in overseeing the empire will perceive the correct way and the principle to be followed. Hence he is able to judge the crooked and the straight, the beginning and the end, as well as to accord with names and thoroughly penetrate the principle. In regard to law specifically, the Boshu promotes the same methodology: "Where one is empty, tranquil, and listens attentively, he takes the law as the tally."55 It is interesting, in light of the attempt by Wang and Chang to recast Han Fei Zi as a Huang-Lao Daoist, to contrast his epistemology with that of the Boshu. Han Fei, in attacking the notion that one can escape one's perspective and access the laws of nature from some Archimedean point by becoming empty and tranquil, shows that his concern lies not with the epistemological foundations of law but with its political utility: I think, however, that the philosophy of tranquility and quietude is a useless notion and the doctrine of indistinctness and mysteriousness a lawless theory. .... Those who make much of non-assertive action (wu wei) and the avoidance of reflective thought (wu siat) as constituting emptiness say it is because their intentions are in this way not controlled by anything. For this reason, those who lack techniques take wu wei and wu si to be emptiness. But to be sure those who think of emptiness in this way never forget emptiness and are thus controlled by the whole process of becoming empty. "Emptiness" means that one's intentions are not controlled by anything. Now, to be controlled by the whole business about becoming empty is not emptiness. The wu weiing of one who is empty does not make of wu wei a constant norm. Where one does not turn wu wei into a constant norm, one is empty .... 56 Han Fei is, firstly, adamant in rejecting the Boshu's epistemology of empti- ness. He believes that we are inevitably bound to our human perspectives, and that in dealing with the world what we need is an understanding of prac- tical techniques of control. Wu wei is one such political expedient, not some mysterious process of meditative self-negation and enlightenment. It consists, for Han Fei, of hands-off management by the ruler, who assigns the details of the daily operations of the government to his ministers.57 Secondly, it is worth observing how Han Fei's distaste for all constant norms coincides with his pragmatic view of law as a tool of the ruler: laws should not be taken as fixed principles but must be alterable where doing so is calculated to be to the ruler's advantage: The law regulates what one does. What one does dictates what one gains. When laws once promulgated are found to be problematic, one must estimate their costs. If one finds what is to be done can be accomplished, he enacts them. If he finds the accomplishment involves losses, he estimates the losses. If he finds gain will exceed losses, he goes ahead with them. For there are in this world neither laws without drawbacks nor gains without losses.58</page><page sequence="13">321 Though Han Fei advocates a rule of law, it is a rule of positive law designed not to accord with laws of nature but to serve the interests of the ruler. IV In the Shi Ji, Sima Qian comments that Shen Dao "studied the techniques of Huang-Lao and Dao De (Daoism)," and that the doctrines of Shen Buhai are "based on Huang-Lao and give prominence to xing mingau."59 Of course, Han Fei is also said to have, in his studies, "returned to Huang-Lao as the source."60 Given the difference between the Han Fei's positive law and Huang-Lao's natural law, we must take Sima Qian's assessments with a grain of salt. Thus, while it is helpful to inquire as to the similarities between Shen Dao, Shen Buhai, and Huang-Lao which might have led Sima Qian to associ- ate them, it will not do to close our eyes to the differences in the respective philosophies. Kanaya Osamu, in a noteworthy article, argues that one must differentiate the Li Kui-Shang Yang-Han Fei line of Legalism associated with Qin Shi Huang Di and the San Jin-Qin area from that of the Dao-Fa Jia scholars of Qi.61 The latter includes the works of Shen Dao, Shen Buhai, parts of the Guan Zi, four chapters of the Han Fei Zi, and Huang-Lao. Although there is room for discussion as to which chapters of which text belong where, I agree that this basic distinction is necessary. I would merely add that more work needs to be done in further distinguishing the various legal philosophies, especially those of the latter group. The foundational naturalism of the Boshu could be useful in this regard. For instance, Shen Dao and the author of the Boshu hold many ideas in common: government is a rule of law; laws are impartial; appointments are made on the basis of ability rather than personal relations; duties are clear and do not overlap; one person is responsible for one post; nature is imper- sonal; ruler and minister have their own duties and yet still cooperate; and government is for the sake of the people rather than the ruler alone. Signif- icantly, the last two points indicate that Shen Dao is, as Kanaya suggests, aligned with Huang-Lao as opposed to Han Fei and Shang Yang. However, one does well to avoid overstating the immediate similarities. The primary motivation in advocating a rule of law for Shen Dao seems to be his distrust of a rule of man, especially one which concentrates power in the hands of a single person. For him, law will insure impartiality: "Of the accom- plishments of law, none is greater than the inhibition of private interests."62 So concerned is he with possible abuses of power that he argues "even if the laws are not good, they are still preferable to no laws at all."63 This is not at all in keeping with Huang- Lao's notion of law as an expression of the objec- tive natural order discovered by the sage. But then Shen Dao flatly denies that this is even possible: "Laws do not come down from heaven; they do not</page><page sequence="14">322 Peerenboom rise up out of the earth. They come from humans and simply coincide with their intentions."64 In the end, we can understand Xun Zi's summary assess- ment that "Shen Dao exalted fa (law) but had no fa"-no law or method-as saying that law for Shen Dao had no foundations.65 Shen Buhai, like Shen Dao, shares many traits with Huang-Lao, the most important being that he distances himself from Shang Yang and Han Fei in not construing the relationship of ruler to his ministers and people as antago- nistic. Moreover, he must be considered, even acknowledging Creel's point that he does not emphasize fa, an advocate of a rule of law as opposed to a rule of man. He repeatedly warns against the display of discretionary powers on the part of the ruler, advising him to hide behind the technique of an impartial matching of his officials' titles or stipulated duties (xing) with their actual performances (ming). In contrast to the author of the Boshu, Shen Buhai comes across in the last word, as Creel insightfully observes, as a pragmatic administrator. He never attempts to delineate the ethical or natural foundations for law but simply offers it as a useful means for ensuring a smooth-running government serving the interests of the people as well as the ruler. His technique of xing ming is not tied to metaphysical grounds via an epistemological project like that of the Boshu, but rather is much more limited in scope, constituting one more political tool for the ruler.66 v In sum, Huang-Lao's Boshu, while advocating a rule of law compatible with an organismic cosmology, is unique in that it supports a natural law grounded in the natural order. That it is a rule of law differentiates it from Confucian- ism, which, in extending wide discretionary latitude to the sage who must balance the many disparate concerns in light of his best judgment, is best understood as a rule of man.67 Yet at the same time, Huang-Lao does have a place for the sage. Instead of relying on his own judgment, however, he is the one who eliminates all personal biases and thereby, or so it is argued, apprehends the objective laws of nature. That law in the Boshu is natural law differentiates it from the positive law of Shang Yang and Han Fei, as well as from the legal philosophies of Shen Dao and Shen Buhai. Though we do well to distinguish the latter two from the former two, this does not entitle us to conflate them simplistically with the Boshu as Huang-Lao. There has been a tendency since the discovery of the Mawangdui texts to make of "Huang-Lao" a dustbin by sweeping too much into it. Rather than robbing a useful term of its classificatory power by calling the Guan Zi, Huai Nan Zi, Lu Shi Chun Qiu, He Guan Zi, and so on all Huang-Lao, we would do ourselves a service, enhancing conceptual clarity and our understanding of the Chinese intellectual tradition in the process, by first laying out the distin-</page><page sequence="15">323 guishing traits of Huang-Lao thought.68 In examining early Chinese legal thought from the perspective of the Boshu text, I have attempted to take a step in that direction by pointing out how the notion of a single objective order not only underlies the author's political agenda of centralized govern- ment, an empire unified under a single ruler, but supports as well the found- ational naturalism which is the cornerstone of the Boshu's theory of natural law. NOTES 1. For an English introduction to the Mawangdui material, see Michael Loewe, "Manuscripts Found Recently in China," T'oung Pao 63, nos. 2-3 (1978): 99-136; and Jeffrey Riegel, "A Summary of Some Recent Wenwu and Kaogu Articles," Early China (1975): 10-15. Some Sino- logists, led by Tang Lan, believe the text I refer to as Huang-Lao Boshu (Silk manuscripts of Huang-Lao) is the Huang Di Si Jing (Four classics of the Yellow Emperor) noted in the Han bibliography Yi Wen Zhi (see Tang Lan, "Mawangdui chutu Lao Zi yiben juanqian guyishu de yanjiu" (Research on the lost ancient text preceding the Lao Zi B discovered at Mawangdui), Kaogu xuebao 1 (1975): 7-38). Tang's arguments, while suggestive, are far from conclusive (cf. Zhang Weihua, "Xihan chunian Huang-Lao zhengzhi sixiang" (The political philosophy of the Early Western Han Huang-Lao school), Zhongguo shehui kexue 5 (1981): 199-208). Rather than leap to any hasty conclusions, I will simply refer to the text as the Huang-Lao Boshu. 2.

My comments as to the appropriateness of the characterization of Confucianism as natural law are limited to pre-Han Confucian thought and primarily to the ideas expressed in the Analects.

John Finnis, a modern natural law advocate and apologist, contends that no natural law theory need maintain that an unjust law is not a law, adding that this is but a subordinate theorem in every natural law theory he knows of. See his Natural Law and Natural Rights (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), p. 351. 7. Feinberg, Harm to Others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 18. 8. This is, of course, Aristotle's distinction. See Nichomachean Ethics V: 7, 1134b18-20. Whether or not Aristotle is indeed a natural- or protonatural-law theorist remains contested. For an argument that he is, see W. von Leyden, Aristotle on Equality and Justice (London: Macmil- lan, 1985); for an opposing view, see D. N. Schroeder, "Aristotle on Law," Polis 4 (1981): 17-31. 9. Interestingly, Hobbes' notion that "law, properly, is the word of him that by right hath command over others," also serves as a departure point for the legal positivism of Austin and others. Indeed, this illustrates one of the shortcomings of Hobbes' theory: one can, by reasoning from the state of nature and the human condition to the need for a social contract, justify not only Hobbes' absolute monarchy but Rousseau's democracy. For a discussion of the natural-law side of Hobbes, see Theodore Benditt, Law as Rule and Principle (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1978); for the positivist side, see Carl J. Friedrich, The Philosophy of Law in Historical Perspective (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958), pp. 84-91.

For an extensive and compelling critique of li as universal principles, see David L. Hall and Roger T. Ames, Thinking Through Confucius (Albany: SUNY Press, 1987), who argue that Confucianism is best interpreted as a pragmatic, aesthetic order rather than a rational, logical order. See also Peerenboom, "Confucian Justice: Achieving a Humane State," International Philosophical Quarterly (1990). 11. Analects 12:13. 12. With its emphasis on equilibrium, Confucius' coherence methodology is more akin to Dworkin's theory of constructive interpretation than the natural-law tradition; see Ronald Dwor- kin, Law's Empire (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1986). 13. Cf. Li Ji 1:35a: "The li do not reach down to the common people; penal law does not reach up to the great officials." 14. Hsiao-po Wang and Leo Chang provide perhaps the most thoroughgoing account of Han Fei, and to a lesser extent Shang Yang, as something more than a legal positivist. They not only argue that for both Legalism and Confucianism "ethics and politics constituted an integrated whole," but portray Han Fei in much the same way I depict the author of the Boshu, contending that he supported natural law grounded in the objective laws of nature; see their Philosophical Foundations of Han Fei's Political Theory (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1986); see also Cheng Chung-ying, "Metaphysics of Tao and Dialectics of Fa," Journal of Chinese Philosophy 10 (1983): 251-284. Wang and Chang base their reading of Han Fei's thought as grounded in Lao Zi's Daoism primarily on five chapters-Yu Lao, Jie Lao, Zhu Dao, Yang Quan, and Da Ti. The authenticity of these chapters, particularly the first four, has long been questioned by many scholars. See Rong Zaozu, Han Fei Zi kaozheng (Taibei: Tailian Guofeng Publishing, 1972); Kimura Eiichi, Hoka shiso no kenkyt (Tokyo: Kobundo, 1944); Hu Shi, Zhongguo gudai zhexueshi (Taibei: Shang Wu, 1961). However, since it is always difficult to prove conclusively what is spurious and what is not, I offer two different lines of attack. First, even if these passages are authentic, they are inconsistent with the basic thrust of Han Fei's philosophy and should be regarded as an attempt to steal a little respect for his philosophy by piggybacking on the reputation of Daoism. Secondly, as I show below, even in the chapters where Han Fei is allegedly most Daoist, he still differs significantly from the author of the Boshu on issues such as epistemology, indicating that he is a legal positivist and not a natural-law theorist. 15. 'Naturalism' is a much abused term. In contending that Huang-Lao espouses a foundation- al naturalism, I intend the following. First, as a naturalism, Huang-Lao privileges the natural order: the natural order has normative priority. It is taken to be the highest value or realm of highest value. Second, and correlate to the first, the human-social order must be consistent and compatible with the natural order rather than nature and the natural order being subservient to the whims and needs of humans. Third, humans are conceived of as part of the cosmic natural order understood as an organic or holistic system or ecosystem. In the language of Huang-Lao, daoi as the cosmic natural order embraces both the way of humans (ren zhi daoaw) as well as that of nonhuman nature (tian zhi daoax). 16. Roger Ames has recently called into question the appropriateness of the organismic metaphor as a characterization of Chinese philosophy on the grounds that it (1) entails a sense of wholeness that is typical of many Western cosmogonic traditions but which is absent in the self- generative cosmologies of pre-Qin China, (2) imparts a potentiality/actuality distinction that obviates the sui generis character and unduly restricts the creativity of the particular, and, most importantly, (3) conjures up images of Aristotelian teleology and the notion of a progressive and steady advance toward a predetermined perfection (Ames, "The Focus Field Self in Classical Confucianism" (Unpublished manuscript)). While Ames' criticisms serve notice that one must take care in employing the organism metaphor-indeed, any metaphor, particularly one laden with philosophical associations from an alternative tradition-they do not require its abandon- ment. Its continued use may be justified in that it does bring out the contrast between the holistic world view of much of Chinese philosophy in which the natural order embraces both humans and nonhuman nature and a dualistic view in which humans and nature are juxtaposed. Even the</page><page sequence="17">325 Boshu, though different in many respects from many pre-Qin philosophies, advances a holistic, organismic view of the natural order. As we shall see, it is possible, contra Needham, to advance a natural-law theory grounded in an organismic natural order. 17. Needham, Science and Civilisation, pp. 214-215. 18. Commenting on the reemergence of Confucianism in the Han, Needham states, "Law again became, as Duyvendak says, firmly embedded in ethics, and successive emperors. . jus- tified their mandates by invoking natural law, i.e. norms of behavior universally considered moral-in fact, li-and not positive law" (Science and Civilisation, p. 214). 19. Bodde has provided textual evidence for a conception of the laws of nature in the physical- science in the writings of Mo Zi, Dong Zhongshu, Ge Hong, the Guan Zi, the Huai Nan Zi, and the Lu Shi Chun Qiu. See Bodde, "Evidence," and also "Chinese 'Laws of Nature,' a Reconsid- eration," Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 39 (1979): 139-156. For a clarification of transcend- ence, see below. 20. See Peerenboom, "Han Dynasty Cosmology: The Emergence of Naturalism," Asian Cul- ture Quarterly 16 (1988): 13-40. 21. For a discussion of correlative thinking in China and the shift around 300 B.c. to causal correlative cosmologies in which the forces underlying and structuring nature become understood in terms of materialistic qi, see A. C. Graham, Yin-Yang and the Nature of Correlative Thinking (Singapore: Institute of East Asian Philosophies, 1986). 22. I would, however, have to demonstrate at least two more points. First, that post-Han Confucian law is, like the pre-Han law of Confucius, not natural law in the foundationalist sense. Of course, to the extent that this helps explain the lack of development of science in China, I am in a much more advantageous position than Needham, who can only fall back on the absence of a transcendent deity to account for this. Secondly, I would need to argue that other significant strains in the Chinese intellectual tradition, such as Daoism and Buddhism, were either organis- mic in Needham's sense and hence did not foster scientific development, or provide some alterna- tive explanation. This must await another forum. 23. I will, for stylistic reasons, refer to the author rather than the author(s). While several scholars have expressed reservations as to the early assessment of Tang Lan and Long Hui that it is one text by a single author, the consensus appears to be that it is a conceptually unified work. See Tang, "Mawangdui chutu Lao Zi," pp. 7-38; Long Hui, "Mawangdui chutu 'Lao Zi' yiben- qian guyishu tanyuan" (A philological study of the lost ancient treatise before the Lao Zi 'A' manuscript unearthed at Mawangdui), Kaogu xuebao (1975): 23-32; and also Tu Wei-ming, "The 'Thought of Huang-Lao': A Reflection of the Lao Tzu and Huang Ti Texts in the Silk Manuscript of Ma-wang-tui," Journal of Asian Studies 39 (1979): 103. For a summary, see Uchiyama Toshihiko, "Maotai bosho Keih6, Jadaiky6, Sho, Dogen shoko" (A brief study of the silk manuscripts unearthed at Mawangdui-Jing Fa, Shi Da Jing, Cheng, and Dao Yuan), Tohogaku 56 (1978): 1-16. It should be pointed out that I have deliberately based my analysis primarily on the Jing Fa section of the text to avoid the issue of this being a single text by one author, a single text by several authors but edited by one person, a single text in the sense of a unified thought system though written by others, or a collection of different pieces by different authors. 24. The term fa has a wide range of meanings in Chinese, from model to standard to law. One could make a case for all of these readings in the Boshu. One might contend, as James Sellman has pointed out to me, that I have simply begged the hermeneutical question by translating fa as 'law' in that in many (perhaps all) of the passages I cite, fa could arguably be rendered in a broader sense than 'law'. To do so, however, would entail a radically different reading of the text than I offer. We can evaluate the relative merits of the various interpretations once they are produced. In the mean- time, that there exists a continuum of possible meanings does not prevent one from opting for the more specific reading when it fits the context better in light of one's overall reading of the text while simultaneously according with the way we use 'model', 'standard', and 'law' in English. There is no reason to privilege a priori the broader meaning. Of course, one must remain sensi- tive to the connotations of the original Chinese word and not assume when reading 'law' that it is isomorphic with fa. In any event, the distinction between law, standard, and model tends to</page><page sequence="18">326 Peerenboom collapse on my reading because specific juristic laws are consistent with and an expression of the moral standards of the natural order. 25.

See Tang Lan, "Mawangdui chutu Lao Zi." The debate as to whether the text belongs to Legalism or Daoism was influenced, however, by the internal politics of the PRC during the "Cultural Revolution."

Both Saiki and Qiu take the Boshu as part of 'Dao-Fa Jia' and not Huang-Lao. Saiki, however, believes that the Boshu and Dao-Fa Jia represent mainstream Daoism of the Early Han while Qiu believes that that honor goes to Huang-Lao. 28. Boshu 47:20a-b. 29. Boshu 58:74b. 30.

Tian', always a difficult word to translate, is, as I will show below, the constant, imperson- al, natural tian of Lao Zi and Xun Zi. Heaven, however, at times reads better in the context. Rather than torturing the English, I suggest that one simply keep in mind when seeing "heaven" that we are talking about the natural order. 37. Boshu 51:41b-42a. 38. Boshu 53:49b-50a. 39.

The latter in particular points out how the emphasis on the complementarity of wen and wu, xing and de not only contrasts with the harsh Legalism of Shang Yang and Han Fei, but coincides with the sociopolitical conditions of the Early Han when Huang-Lao flourished at court. 41. Several articles, however, are suggestive in this regard. See, in particular, Tian Changwu, "Zaitan Huang-Lao"; Cheng Wu, "Hanchu Huang-Lao"; and Zhong Zhaopeng, "Huang-Lao Boshu de zhexue sixiang" (The philosophical thought of the Huang-Lao Boshu), Wen wu 2 (1978): 63-68. There is still great difference of opinion as to the dating of the Huang-Lao school in general and this text in particular. The initial dating of mid-Warring States was given by Tang Lan and by those who followed him. See Tang Lan, "Mawangdui chutu Lao Zi"; Long Hui, "Mawangdui chutu 'Lao Zi"'; Xu Kangsheng, "Lueshuo Huang-Lao"; and Jan Yun-hui, "Tao Yuan or Tao:</page><page sequence="19">327 The Origin," Journal of Chinese Philosophy 7 (1980): 195. But this dating has been seriously questioned and seems to have lost favor. While evidence found in the tomb plus the avoidance of certain taboo words marks the lower limit as early in the second century B.c., there remains much debate within these broad parameters. For those who see it as late Warring States, see Ge Ron- jing, "Shilun Huang-Lao Boshu de dao he wu wei sixiang" (On Huang-Lao Boshu's thought of dao and wu wei), Zhongguo zhexueshi yenjiu (1981): 53; Zhong Zhaopeng, "Huang-Lao Boshu"; and Gao Heng and Dong Zhian, "'Shi Da Jing' chulun."

Asano argues that there are three sources for Huang-Lao natural law: the objec- tive natural order, the dao of Lao Zi, and an anthropomorphic deity (shang diag or tian). Saiki ("Maotai hakusho") sees the Boshu tian as being similar to the anthropomorphic Confucian tian. 46. Boshu 82:159a. 47. Needham, Science and Civilisation, p. 549. 48. Ibid., p. 562. 49. Hall and Ames, Thinking Through Confucius, p. 13. 50. Some Platonists, Terry Penner among them, have questioned the soundness of this distinc- tion. Penner argues that to talk of Aristotle's universals as immanent, as residing "in" things, while Plato's Forms exist "separately" somewhat "out there" in Platonic Heaven, is to speak just as metaphorically in either case. He suggests that the notion of "transcendence" or "separate- ness" be taken in a nonspatial way and to indicate a logical or epistemological difference between particular things and universals: they are separate in thought. See his Ascent From Nominalism, (Boston: D. Reidel, 1987), pp. 97, 118-121. Similarly, I do not simply want to trade in Need- ham's spatial metaphor for a temporal one. The notion of laws of nature being "prior," or "pre- determining," is meant to indicate a logical or conceptual relationship, not a physically temporal one. That is, within the author's thought system, the natural order is conceived of as determining the social order; it has a normative priority as the foundation upon which the social order is constructed. 51. One could, I suppose, refuse it the anachronistic label tian ren he yi on the grounds that the essence of that conception is not simply organicism but nonfoundationalism; to count as tian ren he yi, it would have to be nonfoundationalist organicism, in which the order is not predetermined in accordance with universal principles or laws of nature but emerges as an interaction between humans and their environment. Personally, I see no reason to limit the scope of the term in this fashion. As it stands, it is a perfectly useful concept for capturing an important insight into the general character of Chinese thought as opposed to certain Western cosmologies. One can always further qualify the term, speaking, for example, of a Dong Zhongshu tian ren gan ying variety or Confucius' yiak-based type. 52. Benjamin Schwartz has insightfully described this intuitive clarity as a synoptic or gnostic intuition. His characterization is particularly apt: that it is a kind of intuition captures the direct- ness of Huang-Lao knowledge and the inner certainty that accompanies it; that it is synoptic intuition marks the breadth of scope of the sage's understanding; that it is gnostic intuition affirms the sage's ability to fathom the unfathomable. See Schwartz, The World of Thought in Ancient China (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1985), p. 249. 53. Cf. Xu Kansheng, "Lueshuo Huang-Lao," and Tu Wei-ming, "Thought of Huang-Lao,"</page><page sequence="20">328 Peerenboom pp. 104-105.

To the extent that penal law (xingav) does have a place within Confucius' system, and the li can be considered law in a broad sense, one might characterize Confucius not as a natural-law advocate but as a Dworkinian constructure interpretation proponent (see note 12 above). 68. Wu Guang, Huang-Lao zhi xue tong lun, does attempt to draw some distinctions between these groups. However, he is not totally successful.
