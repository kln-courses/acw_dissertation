<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY KATHARINE M. BANHAM BRIDGES1 INTRODUCTION In the following paper, the writer attempts to put forth a point of view re- garding the primary drives or instincts and their ontogenesis during infancy. It is based upon the results of close observation of infant behaviour considered in the light of various current theories presented in the literature. A list of some of the works from which material or suggestions have been drawn is appended at the end of the article. It would be impossible to give a complete set of re- ferences both for economy of space and because of the difficulty of tracing the number of casual inferences and indirect sources of information which go to form a composite viewpoint. The writer acknowledges appreciatively, however, all such contributions. The expression "primary drives" is here used to refer to those mental proces- ses which are ordinarily termed "instincts" or "instinctive tendencies" in the older text-books of psychology. They are response potentialities which are com- mon to the human race and which gradually manifest themselves in the course of individual development. It was previously thought that these behaviour tenden- cies were inherited. In fact the term "instinct" was often defined as an inher- ited tendency to behave in a certain general way under specified general condi- tions. The word was indifferently used to denote either the predisposition to act or the behaviour pattern in which this potential urge manifested itself. Recent studies of child and animal life have shown how even so-called instinc- tive behaviour undergoes processes of development and change of form in response to environmental conditions. Birds, for example, have been kept north during the migration season by giving them artificial sun-ray treatment. Thus, the in- stincts are no longer considered to be inherited as fully matured reaction pat- terns; they are acquired adaptive responses. Although many psychologists have come to regard instincts as universal habits rather than innate patterns of response, yet they postulate certain inheritable "urges" or "drives" which determine the formation of these general habits. The writer wishes to suggest, on the basis of infant behaviour studies, that the "drives" themselves are ontogenetically developed. Thus, the term "primary drive" is adopted to substitute that of "instinct" in this article, in order to avoid the implication of inheritance either of behav- iour pattern or tendency. But since instinctive behaviour undergoes a process of orderly development and maturation regardless of wide variations in conditions, the possibility of inherited predispositions to respond is not entirely dismiss- ed. Further study of foetal life, however, may reveal the fact that apparently inherited, general behaviour tendencies are pre-natal acquisitions. In previous publications, the writer has endeavoured to show how in the course of individual development emotional behaviour seems to resolve itself into defin- ite patterns, by processes of differentiation, integration, and specialization. Instinctive drives were seen to play an important r6le in this patterning. Con- tinued studies of infant behaviour reveal further that these instinctive drives themselves are adaptive responses to common conditions in the environment. They also go through a defining process of individuation and organization, and they appear in characteristic forms at successive age-levels during early childhood. In emotional behaviour the individual undergoes processes of self-modification and internal adjustment in response to overwhelming external conditions; whereas 1 Assiatant Professor of Psyohology, MoGill University, Montreal, 40</page><page sequence="2">BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY 41 in instinctive behaviour the adapting organism makes attempts to modify the en- vironment to accord with internal conditions. The "primary drives" are response tendencies acquired in relation to common qualities of ordinary recurring situations. They manifest themselves in general patterns of behaviour, which include such specific skills as biting, hitting, pulling or running. And they follow the same laws of growth, maturation, and individuation as do these specialized act~vities. The ordinary names of the dif- ferent instincts refer variously to the type of provoking situation, the nature of the behaviour, or the inferred probable goal of activity. For instance, the hunger instinct takes its name from the stimulating circumstance of gastric nus- cular contraction, pugnacity refers to aggressive behaviour, while escape is the goal of another instinctive response. Possibly the use of the term "drive" in- stead of "instinct" in psychology might result in a more systematic naming of these action tendencies, according to the form of the behaviour trend rather than the provocative cause or the end result. The objectives of instinctive behaviour, for instance personal security or retaliation, provide powerful motives both for intellectual and motor activity. But these goals are not necessarily predetermined. They are rather the effec- tive end-results of previous neuro-muscular activity. Protection of the young, for example, is not a determining cause of maternal behaviour, but rather an end observable from outside. The individual may or may not be fully conscious of the goal or purpose of his instinctive behaviour. He is aware usually of an indefinite "urge" accompanying his behaviour "set" or actual activity in res- ponse to certain frequently recurring common attributes of environmental condi- tions. Any acquired habit is a "drive" to some extent, a potentiality to act in a certain way under appropriate stimulation. The distinguishing features of the habits grouped as "instincts" are their universality, their primacy in ontogen- etic development, and their potency as drives. This potency is determined by continued internal stimulation from organic activity, by the repeated occurrence of common factors in all environmental conditions, by the totality of the organ- ismic response, by the satisfying adequacy of the resulting effect of previous !imilar behaviour, and by the early establishment of these general behaviour trends in childhood. The general conditions, or qualifying attributes, of the environment which arouse these primary drives can be found upon analytical examination of the tot- al situation to which the individual is responding, including both internal bodi- ly and external conditions. Super-ordinate concept names may then be selected to designate these general types of situation. In a similar way, the final goal of instinctive behaviour is an inferred generalization based on the comparative study of numerous specific reactions. The same processes of abstract analysis and generalization applied to the behaviour itself reveal the common features, the conceptual names for which distinguish the different drives. OBSERVATIONAL DATA In order to obtain first-hand information with regard to the nature and devel- opment of the primary drives, these dominating forces in human behaviour, a ser- ies of minute observations were carried out by the writer in two foundling hos- pitals in Montreal. In one institution twenty-four infants between the ages of two weeks and twelve months were observed one morning a week for four months. In the other hospital, forty-eight babies between two and eighteen months of age were observed three hours a week at different times of the day, for a period of six months. In this case, there were three children of each monthly age-level under observation. There were an equal number of boys and girls in each of the two groups. The</page><page sequence="3">42 BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY babies were all in good health, and they were drawn from eleven different nation- al origins. More than half of the mothers were English-speaking Canadians and the others were chiefly of Jewish nationality, originally from Poland or Russia. A further series of weekly observations were made on two groups of older chil- dren in one of these institutions during a period of three months. One was a group of twenty-five girls between three and six years of age, and the other of thirty boys between four and six years, all in good health. The observational records collected during previous studies of the social and emotional behaviour of infants and pre-school children were also consulted for evidence of the growth of primary drives. In analyzing the observational data, temporal factors as well as spatial fac- tors in the situations were taken into account. For instance, the length of time since feeding, since sleeping or since the child's posture had been chang- ed, were considered as important as the mere fact of the arrival of food or a strange visitor. The nature of the child's behaviour was studied in relation to the many aspects of the provocative situations and to the achieved ends. Gene- ralizations were then made with regard to situational qualities, frequent behav- iour responses, and apparent objectives. The main criteria accepted for the "primary drives" were: (1) primary in or- der of genetic appearance of the behaviour pattern; (2) invariability of general type of response upon recurrence of the situation; (3) frequency of occurrence, and duration of the behaviour; (4) universality of the response in all groups of children studied; (5) continuance of the behaviour throughout the age-range ob- served; (6) and to some extent the dominance of the drive in the presence of counter stimulation. Since in this study the writer was only concerned with general behaviour trends, actual numbers of specific responses like arm-extension or head-turning were not counted. Only round figures in time and frequency were compared. Also, in applying the criteria the writer was obliged to make certain minor exceptions when qualifying circumstances were present, especially with regard to the criter- ion of dominance. For instance, the social smile stimulus was a dominating fac- tor over the food stimulus in determining the response of a three-month-old baby who had Just been fed. Three to four hours after feeding-time, mere social ap- proach might cause mouth opening for anticipated food instead of a smile. The drive that dominated under certain conditions or at a particular age was found to be subsidiary in importance on another occasion or age-level. Thus, the follow- ing statement with regard to the development of the major drives is based upon a general consideration of the infant behaviour observed together with reports and opinions of other writers. THE ONTOGENESIS OF THE PRIIARY DRIVES The law of survival operating in the human being takes the form of organismic adaptation both in behaviour and body structure. Processes of growth or expan- sion and development or differentiation take place until a certain optimum is reached. This is determined by internal and external limiting conditions. Along with the processes of growth and development there is also occurring a gradual synthesizing, an eliminating of parts and retrenching. It seems that during in- fancy the growth factors are dominant, while in old age the retrenching processes gain the upper hand. The one basic drive would appear to be that of individual survival, an urge to live as a totality. The earliest responses of the -infant are complete bodily reactions to any specific stimulation. The parts of the total response may not be well-organized to meet particular requirements, but the infant reacts as a whole, moving head, hands, body and legs. The new-born child behaves in such a way as to prolong its life and safeguard its integrity. This it does not only by</page><page sequence="4">BRIDGES: PRINARY DRIVES IN INFANCY 43 expansive movements and increased differentiation of response, but also by elimi- nating unsuitable activity and curtailment of energy expenditure. There seems to be no need to postulate other basal or original drives in addi- tion to the urge for survival. Jung, for instance, has suggested the existence of a regressive tendency to account for disintegrative mental processes, forget- ting and lethargy. Freud, also, has invented a "death instinct" to explain hos- tility and self-punishment in later childhood. But these phenomena are all forms of defensive behaviour, protective in effect, and can be shown to be ex- pressions of the great impulsion for life. Patterns of behaviour become established as response tendencies on account of their adaptive value for life. The satisfactory outcome in comprehensive adjust- ment determines their potency as drives for further action. The accomplishment of this satisfactory adaptation becomes for the individual a part of the total situation-response experience. Upon recurrent stimulation, the memory or sub- conscious expectancy of gratification is then an integral part of the determin- ing situation. Thus, the "idea" of the end becomes the motive for action, and its apparent cause. There is an "object-set" to all the major drives as well as to specific reactions. Reflexes are developed as part of the more general adaptive responses. Cog- hill (12) in his studies of foetal behaviour, has shown that a ten-week-old foe- tus moves body and legs when the eyelid is touched, whereas at birth the response has already become narrowed down to the specific blink reflex. He says "all re- flexes emerge as partial or local patterns within an expanding or growing total pattern that normally is from the beginning perfectly integrated." The writer would prefer to substitute "unified" for the word "integrated" in reference to the total foetal response. "Integrated" would apply better to the gradually or- ganized and specialized behaviour of the more highly adapted child or adult. Reflexes may thus be regarded as pre-natally acquired specific habits, and are but parts of the more general patterns of response called instinctive. Then, the various instincts themselves are particular forms of expression of the biolog- ical urge for survival of organismic integrity. It seems that the individual is constantly seeking something outside of itself to complete itself, and giving something out from itself to relieve itself, while temporary states of equili- brium or of suspended activity occur. General exercise and rest are the first noticeable forms of infant behaviour; and these involve sensory exploration and utilization of the environment. Due to the convenience of circumstances and certain pre-natally acquired reflexes for material intake and elimination, the appetitive drives of breathing and feeding develop immediately after birth. They take on specific form as the result of diminution of useless activity and as they come to have direct reference to the end result which is found by experience to relieve organic tension most satis- factorily. These appetitive drives are determined at first more by internal stimulation through enteroceptors and proprioceptors than externally through the exteroceptors. Later in the infant's development, from the age of two or three months, the sight of food prompts sucking and feeding activity. Curiosity is a drive which makes its appearance very early, during the first and second month of life. Indeed it may be regarded as the explorative and seeking part of all adaptive activity. The shift of attention of the infant from a distant object to a near-by person and thence to a rattling sound or to his own hand are signs of enquiring curiosity or intelligent versatility. As the infant develops his curiosity becomes specific; he watches people's faces, plays with his toes, peers into boxes and later runs in and out of rooms. Curi- osity is like memory, it is an attribute of general intelligence. Yet, just as a person acquires a good memory for this or that type of thing, so an individual may develop strong curiosity or interest in specific materials or subjects of</page><page sequence="5">44 BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY study. It implies incomplete perceptual grasp of a situation and sufficient pre- vious satisfaction to cause repeated attack or further attentive examination. The sense of incompleteness of perceptual grasp or comprehension may be due to the fact that the individual's activity is directed to a remoter end than the one attained, involving greater diversity and complexity of behaviour. The older the child or the more intelligent, the more distant his objective, that is the more extensive the experience required to attain it. At any age it would seem that the more intelligent child has greater power of differentiation of sense data. He responds to partial stimuli and is quickly satisfied with the result of each action insofar as it is a step in a total, more inclusive process of comprehen- sion. His liberated attention then turns to another aspect of the perceptual problem. He is inquisitive and curious. Practical exploitation of the environ- ment follows close upon successful exploration, as part of the general process of adaptive growth in behaviour. Again the bright child soon tires of easy sol- utions and tackles ever more difficult problems leading to remoter ends. The dull child, on the other hand, is motivated by nearer goals and his behav- iour is less versatile. The halo of satisfaction due to some partial success glows, so to speak, over the total behaviour, and he repeats the whole response including mistakes and unnecessary movements over and over again. The dull child, moreover, has a labile attention due to lack of organization of behaviour trends. He turns from one object to another as a result of fortuitous external stimulation. This lability can be distinguished from the alertness of an intelli- gent child whose attention shifts in a more orderly pattern in pursuit of unified interests. The stereotyped behaviour under slightly differing stimulation of the stupid child may also be contrasted with the varied repetition of the bright one. Repetition of successful responses involving memory is a feature of all adap- tive behaviour. It is an important factor in the establishment of the primary drives and in the development of socialized behaviour. Out of this repetitive tendency in the social situation grows the drive to imitate and mimic. The in- fant at first repeats his own pleasing activities; mouthing, fist-sucking, fin- ger play and vocalizing. The sight or sound of his own behaviour becomes con- nected with the specific responses. Later, similar sounds and the sight of oth- ers behaving in the same way prompt the infant to respond in like manner. The imitation is by no means perfect at first. Increasing social approval and per- sonal satisfaction determine the gradual perfection of imitative behaviour, while non-effective reactions are slowly eliminated. From eighteen months of age on through the pre-school period and later childhood the tendency to imitate gathers strength, fostered by social pressure and formal education. In exploring, expanding, searching, the child may pass over or crush things in his way. A successful knock-out blow releases more neuro-muscular energy, which he spends in further exploration or in repetition of the destructive behav- iour. In the case of the dull child this quickly achieved simple satisfaction becomes an end in itself, and destructive behaviour may be prolonged over an in- definite period. The intelligent child is less easily satisfied, the destruction for him was merely a way of overcoming an obstacle to his perceptual growth. It may have been only partially successful because the loss or destruction of the object of interest brought disappointment and a further check to his endeavours. On the other hand, along with social approval, it may have created new problems to be solved and opened up new vistas to be thus pleasantly explored. Bed- clothes, for instance, are first fingered curiously and pulled by the three- month-old, kicked by the five-month-old, and pushed away by the seven-month-old that he may examine his toes. The overcoming of obstructive obstacles is a stepping-stone in behaviour de- velopment and comes to be one of the primary drives. The child repeats those surpassing or crushing performances which are successful in part at least in</page><page sequence="6">BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY 45 changing environmental conditions to meet his needs. Pushing the crib bars which confine his movements the infant slides, and sliding makes further exploration possible. Thus, incidental to discovering new kinesthetic, cutaneous, visual or audi- tory perceptions, the child learns the advantage of resisting obstructions. A tendency to resist or oppose intervention soon develops, at first directed against obtrusive objects and later against interfering persons. Within a few weeks after birth slight resistance to pressure is offered by head, shoulders and arms. By four months of age an infant will push a little with his feet. And by five or six months he not only presses with hands and feet, but he begins to show some social resistance. Between one and two years of age a strong tend- ency to contrariness develops. This weapon the child may wield to considerable personal advantage. By counter attacks, in the social situation, the eighteen-month-old often suc- ceeds in overcoming intervention and achieves his end. For instance, an infant will recapture his toy after hitting the child who took it away from him. He may strike so hard as to cause violent vocal protest and hitting in return, partly through imitation but mostly in opposition. The child then becomes so "intrigied" or attracted by this new-found way of controlling the social situa- tion, that he is deterred from his original objective in favour of "getting-ev- enn. Varied exploration leads to the discovery of numerous means of revenge. For example, one foundling infant of sixteen months quietly sat on a much stron- er child of about the same age, who kept pushing hin over or grabbing whatever he was holding. The drive to "get-even" is expressive in part of the fundamental tendencies for balance and compensatory action, though it is mainly a social form of the op- positional tendency. Revengeful behaviour is so often successful in obtaining social recognition and control that a powerful "get-even" tendency is common in pre-school children who have developed a strong drive for self-assertion. The latter is generally the result either of continual frustration, or the pleasing flattery of excessive attention. In exaggerated form, then, the vengeful tend- ency becomes rather a drive to "get more than even" and dominate the situation. Genetically speaking, the urge for survival shows itself upon birth first as a drive for exploration, for increase and differentiation of sensory experience. Finding obstacles the infant opposes them. In so doing, he discovers further experiential possibilities and satisfying adaptations. Either he overcomes the obstructions or he utilizes them in his progressive growth and adventurous recon- noitering. Each stage in his procedure serves as a basis for the next. Repeat- ing successful performances on subsequent occasions, the child comes to develop a strong utilitarian drive for adaptive exploitation of parts of his environment. The four-month-old baby fingers his dress, the six-month-old pulls and sucks it, while the nine-month-old draws it over his face to shield himself from the gaze of a stranger. Dropping small objects, tearing paper, and other easy forms of destructive activity are indulged in during the latter half of the first year. Such behav- iour usually succeeds in exploiting both the material and social environment at the same time. It is not until about one year of age that constructive perform- ances make their appearance. At this age the infant combines two objects for his use. He rattles a stick in a tin can, scribbles on a hard surface with a pencil, and builds a tower with two blocks. He creates something and becomes aware of himself as the producing agent. Attending to his product he modifies and im- proves upon it, Thus, the creative urge for construction has its beginnings. It is about this age that the child shows interest in his own excreta. Quite probably he regards them as creative products, comparable to his scribbled lines or block tower.</page><page sequence="7">46 BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY Returning to the new-born baby again, some experiences may be so intense and overwhelming as to cause emotional shock. Internal visceral adjustments are made, including increased glandular activity. More nervous energy is thereby liberated and many varied patterns of actions are innervated. There results a mutual blocking of motor responses and a temporary suspension of activity. Some general reactions follow, and whatever behaviour serves to reduce the stimulus is the one repeatedly favoured. This is usually a retreating reaction or contin- ued immobility. Thus, a tendency to avoid obnoxious stimuli begins to develop. It makes its appearance almost immediately after birth, as does the tendency to oppose mechanical resistance. Opposing negative reactions and avoidance are both patterns of behaviour involving biologically protective reflexes acquired in the pre-natal period. One of the earliest signs of withdrawal is that from painful stimull within the first month. Three or four months later the infant turns his head and squirms to avoid glaring lights or being fed unsweetened, lumpy food. Besides living in a world of inanimate objects, the baby's environment from birth is also a social one including people. Along with food, comfort and warmth, the child is provided with an animated pantomime and social attention. Certain of the infant's reactions result in attracting or prolonging this entertaining attention. These responses tend to be repeated, and the child comes to seek at- tention. In so doing he influences and partially controls the movements of oth- ers. This further advantage results in the development of a strong drive for social recognition. At first the infant explores tactually, olfactorily, and visually his human contacts like any others. Moving persons as such are singled out by him for special observation within the first few weeks. By two months of age his gaze follows a person's face. At three months he turns his head towards the sound of a human voice; and by four months he coos and kicks delightedly at any social ap- proach. He laughs and smiles in playful response, and cries when the attentive person leaves him. The five-month-old repeats his own vocalizations and movements; and gradually he discovers himself as the cause of these phenomena. About this time he begins to resist social interference with his activities. He stiffens and thrusts out his foot if it is held, and hesitates in responding to the playful approach of a stranger. He is becoming an autonomous individual; and for the next few months he explores the inanimate world and develops manipulative and locomotive skills, at times quite heedless of the social factors in his surroundings. Later, between nine and ten months, repeating his own perceived movements and those of others, the infant discovers the social approbation and practical advan- tages that follow imitation. Mimicking then becomes a pastime and a tool for personal control of social and other events. He echoes sounds in his vocaliza- tion, then syllabic speech. And so, from one year onward he rapidly acquires a drive for vocal communication. His social dependence and subservience is again highly noticeable. In a few months' time, however, he recoils from too much so- cial control; and by the age of eighteen months he is the contrary little run- away familiar to all nurseries. Thus, the social drives develop from aimless exploration to appreciative ac- quiescence. Then follow definite attention-seeking and social responsiveness around four months of age. Resistance against interference, withdrawal from strangers, and personal assertion develop next, followed by imitation and social cooperation before the age of one year. Preferences for certain individuals later become noticeable, and obstinate social resistance is characteristic behav- lour of the two-year-old. At three years of age the child begins to show powers of social organization. He arranges dramatic play, for instance, with one or two children or a grown-up, In such behaviour his social suggestibility and affability are combined with, and</page><page sequence="8">BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY 47 even subordinate to, a drive for self-assertion. Thus, ascendancy and "leader- ship" are but outgrowths of the general tendency to exploit and utilize parts of the environment, operating in a social setting. Further socialization takes place during the pre-school years when the child adapts his own ends to accord with others' wishes; and so in pleasing himself he comes to serve the needs of others. This is the beginning of the drive for so- cial altruism. In one of the foundling hospitals, for instance, during the rest period, a four-year-old boy who was ordinarily rather timid risked the stern reprimand of the attendant by leaving his place to help another boy struggling to fasten his suspenders. He was the last straggler from the wash-room, and the children were not allowed to lie down till they had fastened their buttons. During the sociable, submissive and imitative one to two-year period, the child does not seem to differentiate clearly as yet between the self and the others. He responds to their situations as well as his own; for instance, he may cry for the other child's hurt, or at a threatening blow directed against his nurse. He treats his doll or his favourite playmate as though they were himself, by patting, feeding, dressing, and so forth. The child apparently i- dentifies himself with familiar persons as a sort of extended ego, and resists the intrusion of strangers. Between two and three the child's own personality seems to become isolatea. He sets himself in opposition to others and shows social independence of conduct. But between three and four years of age the child learns some of the benefits of combined activity and social cobperation in little games of house or storekeep- ing. Then it is that the growing individual seems to adopt, or co-opt others into temporary groups of two or three. The child's behaviour with the adopted friend would suggest that there is still considerable personal identification. If the playmate is older he is patient and acquiescent in his company; and if younger he helps, teaches and protects him. Here is the first sign of maternal protectiveness, a drive which may owe part of its strength to this identification of the self with the members of the fami- liar and friendly social set. Even animals may protect their offspring as part of themselves. It is well-known that as soon as young animals show signs of in- dependent activity, the mother leaves them to take care of themselves and shows little further interest in them. Not only does the pre-school child identify his best friends with himself, but he also behaves at times as if he were they. As Susan Isaacs has pointed out, he projects or introjects himself into their situation and dramatises his behaviour accordingly. In so doing he shows clearly that by this age he can dif- ferentiate between himself and the other, although his socially functioning ego may include him. One of the most helpful ways of studying the nature and rela- tive strengths of a child's own drives is by watching how he treats his dolls or playmates with whom he identifies himself. He treats them as he is accustomed to be treated, and has them do what he wants to do. In the same way the r6le that he selects to act is expressive of his own drives and ambitions, even if it is merely to squirm along the ground like an alligator. Less favoured members of the social environment and strangers may have pro- jected upon them the child's own behaviour tendencies which are usually met with reprimand and checks. The child treats them as if they were the "bad" part of himself, and scolds, punishes, or shuns them. Again, observation of the way children behave with regard to those they dislike gives further clue to their own drives and behaviour conflicts. Any person and even the rag-doll may be treated with favour or disfavour at different times, dependent upon recent events which have encouraged, checked, or handicapped the child. He may identify him- self in his actions with the constraining authority and scold or impede the other self-surrogate. Or, he may emulate the behaviour of the object of his affection-</page><page sequence="9">48 BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY ate attachment in flattering pantomime. Here we see among children at so early an age the origin of the social scapegoat and hero. There is no sex difference noticeable in this self-projection and personal identification in the social behaviour of the child. Boys have their doll at- tachments, and boss or protect smaller children just as do the girls. Both sexes of infants show a preference for mothers and nurses among the adults, on account of the comforting treatment received from them. In the foundling hospitals the children could not have Oedipus or Electra complexes, as they were always tended by nurses in uniform. The resident physician, also in a white coat, would only visit the infants occasionally. The nurses no doubt showed preferential treat- ment towards the babies, according to their temperaments, and some received more attention than others. But every child was the favourite or special care of somebody. Sex differences in behaviour and preference for companions are mainly social- ly determined. The behaviour and remarks of adults versed in local traditions influence and encourage certain types of comportment among the children. This influence is greater in some family circles than others, and may begin to oper- ate during the socially suggestible one to two-year age period. Sex attachments, however, are of secondary and minor importance to the general personal-utility motive of the growing child. The sex instinct, so-called, can hardly be regard- ed as a primary drive in early childhood, for it does not show signs of being a dominant motive force in behaviour till around the age of puberty, or even later. It is generally agreed that boys are on the whole more boisterous in their play activities than girls. In a pre-school group girls may be seen to play together, drawn by common interests in less energetic games. Bigger boys may show, solicitation and considerate attention towards the smaller girls. But this is probably because the younger girls in a nursery group are apt to be the weak- er members most requiring assistance. If the smallest in the group happen to be little boys, they receive similar care and consideration. The same protective drive operates in both sexes. Though, when it is manifested by boys it is often taken for sexual interest, and, as expressed by girls it is called maternal in- stinct. Just as in primitive races the women, the slaves and the "underdogs" show the most compassion towards one another, so in a group of pre-school children, the girls and the more delicate boys are apt to show greater sympathy and kindness in their behaviour. Again this is not an original sex difference but rather a matter of relative strength of constitution and difference in experience. Ro- bust girls may be very bossy and rough in their protective behaviour. Children who are often ill may understand better the suffering of others. But, on account of their weakness and the pleasant pampering they generally receive, they are apt to be exacting in their social demands and indifferent to the needs of others. Maturing infants in their gradual discovery of the world about them in their exploitation of its possibilities to facilitate living, become slowly aware of themselves in action as causal agents. In waving their arms and sucking their fists they see and feel their hands. Later they hear their own voices and find their toes. Different local motor functions develop at more or less definite regular stages during the first two years of an infant's life. Gesell and Biihler, among others, have charted these phases of maturation very carefully; and have shown how such orderly development of behaviour depends on the effect of gravity, position, contact stimuli, light, sound, and internal organic stimulation. The attentive interest and primary drives of the infant, therefore, concern certain types of object and forms of motor activity at different age levels in conformity with this process of maturation. The one-month-old baby sucks his fist and gazes at distant objects, the three-month-old plays with his hands, the four- month-old laughs and kicks on social stimulation, and so forth. Psychoanalysts</page><page sequence="10">BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY 49 have suggested that children go through phases of oral eroticism, then anal ero- ticism and narcissism in the course of their instinctive or "libidinal" develop- ment. Certainly children mouth and suck objects continually during the first ten months of their lives. But this is only one mode of their activity in exploring the environment. Lips are well supplied with tactile end-organs, and all parts of the feeding process are associated with the gratification of hunger. These actions, moreover, are often repeated. Later, between one and two years of age usually, when the child is less deve- loped in clothing, he becomes aware of his own eliminative processes. At the same time he is being socially trained. His attention is drawn to the elimina- tive functions; and he discovers more of his own creative powers and means of exploiting the environment, for example, by incontinence or retention. Besides appreciating the newly differentiated sensations and perceptions, the infant quickly learns to utilize these additional methods of attracting other's atten- tion and making the social environment respond to his bidding. This phase &amp;-ad- ually passes when the child runs about and discovers ever further and further possibilities. The egotistical and often stubborn two or three-year-old is very busy exploit- ing his own capacities as a creative and controlling agent. He may be said to be narcissistic; he may be even called auto-erotic and auto-sexual, for often about this time he explores and manipulates his own genitalia. But these terms only refer to a limited aspect of the child's development at this period. Des- pite his self-absorption and obstinacy, he is very socially dependent and sensi- tive. He displays his productive play achievements continually for attention and approval. He mimics speech and manners, and takes especial delight in hit- ting, dragging things, and making a noise. To talk of certain "erotic" phases in infancy, namely the oral, anal, and auto-erotic, as if these were fundamental drives expressed later in many specific forms of behaviour, seems to be rather misleading. Comparative studies of in- fants show that orally directed attention and behaviour is only one aspect of the adaptive activity of the human organism. One might just as well speak of the "arm-eroticism" of the four-month-old during the period of gesticulating and ab- ortive attempts at grasping., One might equally well prefer to the babbling of the seven-month-old as "ear eroticism" or "vocal eroticism". The same argument would apply to the exaggeration of the importance of certain other aspects of in- fant learning in the extensive application of such expressions as "anal erotic" and "auto erotic". To be sure, an obstinate child, one in conflict with his social environment, may utilize his power to withold the evacuation of faeces as a means of control- ling the authorities in charge of him. But he will also refuse to take off his shoes, follow the offending adult when out for a walk, or eat his food at meal- time. "Anal fixation", so-called, may well be an expression of obstinacy and thus a symptom of social maladjustment. But it can hardly be said to be the primary cause of the latter. Emotional disturbance, due to social conflict and inhibition of action, may produce such temporarzy functional disorders as consti- pation or diarrhoea, according to immediate conditions and the physiological constitution of the child. These can become fixated as habits depending upon recurrence of circumstances and the usefulness of the purpose served. They are not primary motives but specific aspects of social and personal adjustment to physiological and climatic conditions and local conveniences. The psychoanalytic term "fixation" is a concept of general significance which can be applied to the establishment of certain strong habits or stereotypies. Dependent upon favourable accruing results, upon the recurrence of situations, lack of discrimination, and inability to explore further in a certain direction, a child may develop a repetitive tendency for some particular behaviour form, such as scattering toys about or chewing the paint off them. Stereotyped behav-</page><page sequence="11">50 BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY lour or habit fixations are often indicative of extreme conflict and opposition, or lack of native capacity to explore and adjust. They may also, however, be personally satisfying adjustments to relatively unchanging circumstances. The highly intelligent child cannot repeat indefinitely. Other interests, held in abeyance by the one activity, divert the child's attention and modify his re- action, Neurotic, emotional children, mostly under social stress, and the intel- lectually dull children go on repeating inadequate attacks upon a problem. In so doing they learn by hard knocks to differentiate, and they gather additional emotional energy to strive, to explore further and develop. Intelligent neuro- tics show little variations in their behaviour within a general pattern, while the stupid child's stereotypies are inflexible and specific. Biting, which is quite a common reaction of two and three-year-olds, is re- garded by psychoanalysts as expressive of the second oral phase of a child's in- stinctive development. He derives pleasure from biting rather than sucking, and may even bite his companions. This is taken to be a hostile social reaction and indicative of a fundamental motive of hostility. Freud, moreover, proposes the existence of a "death instinct" towards self-annihilation to account for this hostile motive. The "death wish" is projected outward on to some surrogate ob- ject or person, whom the child treats in an aggressive and antagonistic manner. Close observation of infant and pre-school behaviour, however, suggests that biting on the part of a baby under a year may be a friendly act. It is but a variation of his generally appreciative exploration, in which he pokes, pulls, licks or tears attractive objects. Biting other people may prove to be an effec- tive way of ordering the environment to further immediate ends, until deterred by severe social disapprobation. As mentioned previously, the two to three-year- old is passing through a socially refractory age, and he may hit upon biting as a temporary measure for getting his own way. One sixteen-month-old infant in the hospital bit and pulled the hair of another the same age, who repeatedly took his toys. Pugnacity or aggressiveness is a strongly developed tendency towards social opposition, probably largely based upon early frustration of activity. It also depends upon robustness of health, muscular energy, and limitation in variety of interests. During the process of social training, it is quite possible that a child may become disappointed in his own conduct and ability to conform to adult standards. His disagreeable behaviour offends others and in so doing it thwarts his own socially determined ambitions. He hits out, consequently, in opposition to the restraining authority and also against himself whom he introjects into the other person. A child's hostile behaviour may thus sometimes be an expres- sion of self-criticism. He "punishes" both himself and the other offending per- son in imitation of adult teaching methods. In civilized countries, where there is much social discipline and formal ed- ucation, children may develop a "sense of guilt", to use a psychoanalytic term, beginning about the pre-school period. It is an awareness of an internal con- flict between drives for personal gratification and the avoidance of social dis- approval. A frequent solution of this conflict is in actual or phantasied self- punishment., By punishing or depriving himself of enjoyment the child incidental- ly becomes the emulated authority, while he continues to get satisfaction from his "guilty" or naughty behaviour. Hostile behaviour, whether directed outward upon the community or against the self, is always an expression of the primary tendency to oppose frustration. It is determined by the primal urge for individual growth and survival. The recent psychoanalytic theory, on the contrary, holds that there is an original "death instinct", a drive for self-annihilation which manifests itself through the "punishment phantasy" and in all hostile behaviour. Antagonistic reactions are all supposed to be directed against the self masquerading in the other person. This seems to the writer to be a complete reversal of the order of things.</page><page sequence="12">BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY 51 Pugnacious behaviour is a sign of life; and any partially gratifying phantasy there may be accompanying it is rather that of death or destruction of the of- fender. Even suicidal behaviour may be explained as an extravagant, and incidentally inadequate, expression of the life impulse. Firstly, it is most common during adolescence when the urge for living is strong and when social adaptations are still in the process of formation. The youth in his growing ambition identifies himself idealistically with the social group and adopts its standards of conduct. Childish behaviour tendencies assert themselves, impeding his progress. His glands are active, and he works up an emotional fury against the tiresome and tabooed tendencies in himself. Then, he may do violence to himself In angry revenge, and at the same time to force the attention of the social world upon such an awkward and apparently insignificant person. Other cases of self-destruction may be partly defensive in aim. An individ- ual may be so shocked and overwhelmed by difficulties, material and social, as to be emotionally inhibited in his behaviour. He reacts by recoiling from soc- ial influence; and suicide may be an ultimate retreat from danger. Again, this is a paradoxical manifestation of the drive for self-protection and individual survival. Any of the numerous forms of "masochistic" behavior, self-sacrifice and ab- negation can be shown similarly to be specific expressions of the life impulse. They are kinds of social adaptation in which the individual identifies himself with the group, the ideal "cause", or the person inflicting injury. The drive for expansive growth and for safe protection is manifested by parents in patient care of their offspring, their newer selves. Even the motherly little four-year- old, who suffers deprivation of her toys and painful slaps from the younger child in her charge, is gaining adaptive control of the situation. In serving temporal- ly she insures dependence of the little one and greater power of dominance for herself. At the same time she fondly enjoys the indulgent freedom and vigi- lant protection accorded to the younger child as if it were for herself. Acts of retention seem at first to be rest pauses in the struggle for contin- ued existence. The child holds on to the objective obtained before striving and exploring beyond. This may be just a stopping place, such as one step in a flight of stairs, or an actual toy object that the child coveted. Under one year of age babies rarely cling to anything for more than a few minutes. But the runabout child, between one and two and a half years, holds tenaciously to his toy animal and defends it from all claimants. Such strong possessiveness is determined in part by a conservative tendency to remain in a satisfactory posi- tion and avoid undue expenditure of energy; but it is also an expression of the drive for balance and personal integrity. The rest allows other interests to come into force and direct behaviour; and processes of organization and action planning or thought go on during this time. Furthermore, the anthropomorphic infant seems to introject himself into the object of his choice. He apparently regards it either as a replica of himself or as an appendage; and for this reason he guards it as vigorously as he would defend himself. The year-old child is learning to use objects as tools. A stick is useful as the prolongation of an arm. So here is another factor in possessiveness, the clinging to any means of extending the possibilities of ex- ploiting the environment. Playmates or friendly grown persons may be annexed and utilized in the same way. Collecting small objects is a behaviour trend which makes its appearance us- ually during the pre-school years, and is doubtless another manifestation of ego- expansion and the drive to control the environment. It was noticed in one found* ling hospital, where the children under two years of age had a variety of play- things, that the younger ones sought objects of any kind chiefly for their mani-</page><page sequence="13">52 BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY pulative potentialities. The older ones selected and clung to objects with pleasant familiar associations, things that were of "historical" value to them. Thus, acquisitive behaviour might be regarded as a manifestation of the drive to preserve personal integrity and continuity, in holding the past to the present for future development. In the other foundling hospital, observations were made on the behaviour of a group of three to six-year-old children, devoid of play materials, when leaves torn from a book were scattered among them. All the children tried to claim as many as they could, and several struggled or fought for possession. After a few minutes an optimum balance was reached. The more persistent and the older had the larger collections. Then the children treated the material according to the relative strengths of their more individual drives, and their general maturity level. Some put the papers in a heap and sat on them. Some tore them into little pieces. Others spread them on benches with edges touching together; and one or two pretended to read from the pages in mimic pantomime of adults. Similar behaviour was shown on another occasion when handfuls of rags were distributed. The smaller children held the bundles firmly in their hands and carried them about. Some tied pieces together into long strings. One made a skipping rope, two made crowns, and two others belts. Some sat and smoothed out the material; while the oldest dressed herself in pieces knotted together. According to Charlotte Biihler's observations, pre-school children under six collect any sort of material merely for possession. From seven years onwards they collect things which can be put to practical purposes, and the collections of adolescents are made for ideal ends. At each stage the objects are first chosen for their subjective value and later for more objective and social value, The writer, however, found infants amassing small objects even under the age of two years; while grasping one or two single objects is a common reaction after the age of six months. Some degree of selection was evidenced in the very earl- iest collections, depending apparently upon portability, brightness of colour, sound-producing properties, and general manipulative possibilities. Sometimes the behaviour of the three-year-olds towards their temporary possessions suggest- ed that they had some symbolical representational value, signifying a person or a whole social event. At other times the objects were exploited as tools or building materials, use often being found for them after they were collected. In the foundling hospital experiment, the children who hoarded or merely clung to their materials were the younger or the relatively quiet and inactive ones of the pre-school group. The older and the more lively investigated the possibili- ties of their new possessions and put them to use. Timid children were afraid to display their pieces of stuff for fear of having them taken. Conservative be- haviour may thus be an outcome of relative weakness and a sense of insecurity. The lack of drive involved may also be due to mental dullness and inflexibility and to temporary satisfaction in the attainment of an immediate end. Both in their exploration of the inanimate world and in their social reactions, the foundling children manifested waves of expansiveness followed by periods of retirement and self-absorption or active independence, The three-month-old be- came increasingly interested both in things that moved and in people. The seven- month-old manipulated objects but showed less interest in people. The eleven- month-old sought company again and was socially suggestible; while the eighteen- month-old would run away from the group or escape from the room, when possible, to investigate beyond. Inhibited, shy behaviour, with bent head and adverted gaze was acquired by some children during one of the socially resistant phases, that is, around seven, eighteen or thirty months of age; and it was preserved as a means of holding at- tention during the periods of greater sociability. Such bashfulness appeared to be an attempt at adjustment to satisfy two somewhat incompatible drives: that</page><page sequence="14">BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY 53 for special attention fostered by social dependence, and the contrary drive to dominate rather than be controlled by the social environment. This awkward, shy behaviour was gradually modified as it proved to be inconvenient or even a social handicap. In the case of highly suggestible children of pre-school age, retirement to a corner or bashful immobility seemed to be less a desire for attention than a con- servative, defensive reaction against undue social stimulation and exploitation. In fact, it was a simple avoidance response to escape attention and reduce the overwhelming social influence. The same sensitive children were less shy in a small group of five or six than in larger groups of twenty or thirty. The drives of universal importance in motivating behaviour developed in vary- ing amounts of strength in different children. Although "physical energy," or- ganic functioning, and native learning capacities had much to do with this; yet fortuitous arrangement of circumstances and the recurrence of events were seen to be powerful determining factors. One rosy-cheeked boy, who was a favourite among the nurses, had more practice than others in learning to walk and speak and operate the rocking chair. He developed a strong drive for domination both of the hospital attendants and the other children. He was persistently aggres- sive when thwarted, and by the age of eighteen months he succeeded in damaging several pieces of rurniture through bumping it with his rocker. Other children, due to their own peculiar circumstances, developed a cautious- ness in behaviour, hesitating and retreating from the slightest difficulty. Cer- tain children were acquisitive and grasping, possibly because of some unexpected or intense satisfaction thus derived. Moreover, the strength of a drive, such as that for possession, for social seclusion, or for leadership, was found upon an- alytical study to be due very often to "over-determination". The behaviour serv- ed several purposes and was the outcome of the amalgamation of two or more pri- mary impulsions. Some of the more powerful drives developed during infancy showed periods of recurrent dominance in childhood. For example, sociability, contrariness, ag- gression, altruistic kindness and conservative possessiveness showed recurrent waves of dominance; but each time the behaviour took a slightly different form and had reference to different classes of objects or specific persons. Such periodic variations did not appear quite at the same age-levels for all children, although there was considerable correspondence. They could no doubt be accounted for by factors of general growth and maturation, organic and climatic changes, health, social customs, and the primary urge for balance and integrity. In all probability, recurrence in the dominant strength of certain drives might be traced throughout the whole life span. The same order in development of the more specific behaviour tendencies was not followed invariably by all the infants under observation, due to experiential differences. But again, there was much similarity which could be attributed to the known orderliness of maturation during the first two years, and to the homo- geneity in all children's environments. Only the fundamental urge for living is the same for every child. The adaptive forms in which it expresses itself must perforce vary with individual experience. CONCLUSION Primo vivere. The human organism's first and most fundamental behaviour drive is to extend and prolong its life and to preserve its individual integrity. This involves sensory discrimination and differentiation of response so as to effect environmental adaptation. Such reactions begin even before birth. Growth and useful coSrdinatlon of response take place concurrently. But, according to the environmental conditions encountered, these adaptive reactions take various forms.</page><page sequence="15">54 BRIDGES; PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY The infant at birth shows a tendency towards expansive exploration among mild and slowly changing stimulus patterns. He has already, also, a tendency to ar- restation of movement upon sudden extensive change or intense sensory impact. Accumulated experience makes of this reaction a drive to avoid the obnoxious and whatever threatens personal security. Explorative curiosity grows apace in all sensory fields during the first few weeks, from scents and surfaces to persons, small objects and voices. Integra- tive perception and manipulative exploitation are going on at the same time. Physiological rhythms and appetitive intake and excretion are productive of the fundamental drives for functional balance, for breathing, feeding, eliminat- ing, exercise and repose. Postural adjustment to gravity, based again upon muscle elasticity and reciprocal action, is the earliest form of a general tend- ency to compensatory reactions. This shows later in swaying movements, artistic symmetry in construction, and in moral judgment. Obstacles to infant activity are met with resistance. This opposing reaction develops into negativism or contrariness at frustration in the sccial situation. Augmented by assertiveness it becomes aggression. Counter-attacks lead to the development of a tendency to revenge or "get-even." Advantageous rest pauses between explorations, or attacks on problems, result in the establishment of a conservative tendency to retain hold. Objects first actively grasped, then conservatively held, come to be amassed as possessions. These are utilized mechanically; or they are given symbolic significance at least by the pre-school age, and treated dramatically as human surrogates. Ac- quisitiveness and possessiveness added to social antagonism can become stealing and hoarding. Repetition of successfully adaptive behaviour in recurrent situations develops into imitation in the social setting. The tendency to imitate together with al- ternating assertion and submission constitute the drive for amicable social reci- procity. Acquiescent social behaviour or submissiveness is based upon associated drives for appetite gratification and security, together with the growth drive for self- expansion. Assertiveness is at once an expression of the tendency to compensa- tory behaviour in a social situation in order to preserve individual independ- ence of action, and a form of exploitation of the social environment. Altruistic behaviour develops from a useful combination of submissiveness and assertion; while maternal protective behaviour is a later development of self-protection through personal identification. All of the above-mentioned fundamental drives develop within the first two years, excepting social altruism and protectiveness which are usually acquired between the third and fourth year. The primary drives become further differen- tiated and directed towards varying specific ends with increasing age. Combina- tions also continue to occur, the samie objective serving as a goal and means of gratification for several basic drives. Sexual attractions and impulsions com- plicate social behaviour during later childhood and adolescence, increasing the strength and specificity of social responses. Then follows the urge to propag- ate stimulated partly by increased genital activity, and expressing in yet an- other form the search for means of extending and prolonging life. Innumerable individual variations develop both in behaviour-form and object-set of the de- rived drives; but these all have their bases in the general adaptive responses acquired in the first and second year of life. Appended below is a schematic outline, indicating the sequence of development of the primary drives from birth to the end of the pre-school period of child- hood.</page><page sequence="16">BRIDGES: PRIMARY DRIVES IN INFANCY 55 SCHEMATIC OUTLINE OF THE ONTOGENESIS OF THE PRIMARY DRIVES Before Birth The original, fundamental drive for individual survival operates through har- monious and economic adaption, involving principles of growth, differentiation, conservation, balance, elimination or reduction, and co6rdination. Birth to One Month General and special behaviour tendencies relative to environmental conditions evolve in a more or less definite order. Rhythmic exercise and rest, appetitive drives of breathing and feeding, sensory exploration, counter-action and compen- sation, avoidance, and utilization or exploitation all develop during the first month. One to Three Months Before the third month drives for tactual, visual and auditory curiosity, manipulation, postural adjustment, and sociability develop. Three to Six Months Tendencies towards acquisition, vocalization, assertion, shy retreat, and so- cial submission make their appearance. Six to Twelve Months Drives for hostile aggression, imitation, destruction, and possession develop. Twelve to Twenty-four Months The drives for locomotion, creative construction, vocal communication, obstin- ate resistance, revenge, flight, and social compassion become evolved, Two to Five Years During the pre-school period tendencies towards social simulation and dissi- mulation develop involving processes of introjection and projection. Rivalry, collecting, protectiveness, and an urge for justice also make their appearance. REFERENCES (1) Allen, A. H. B.: Pleasure and instinct. New York, Harcourt, Brace, 1930. (2) Babson, R.
