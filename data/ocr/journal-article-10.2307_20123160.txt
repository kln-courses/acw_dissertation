<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE REVIEW DF METAPHYSICS A Philosophical Quarterly Volume III, 2 DECEMBER 1949 Number 10 PHILOSOPHY AND HISTORY I The problem of history and the problem of writing history have come to interpenetrate so closely that the "task of the historian" is the customary, almost the instinctive, point of departure for the theoretical analysis of history. This attempt to project the philosophical problem of history from the ground of the theoretical problems of historiography is the essence of the broad movement called "historicism" and reaches its most complete expression in "absolute historicism" in which phi losophy is resolved without residue into the methodology of historiography. From the point of view of the euristic conditions of a philosophical problem of history no point of departure could be less promising. The historistic program, as a matter of fact, constitutes a fallacy of perspective which, persisted in, must render the formulation, to say nothing of the resolution, of a genuine philosophical problem of history impossible. The theoretical problems of historiography derive chiefly from an ambiguity at the heart of the historian's task; historio graphy is uncertain as to its own theoretical character, that is, its character and status as a mode of knowing. On the one hand, historiography is oriented wholly toward the concrete, toward its rich and inexhaustible determination in quality; [119]</page><page sequence="2">120 A. Robert Caponigri moreover, the concrete toward which it is oriented, is not stat uesque, substantively plural and fixed, but fluid, dynamic, con tinuous. Such concretion can be fixed and rendered for ex pression and communication only in narration, in images, there fore; as a consequence, written history appears in its own self-consciousness, that is to historiography, most immediately as art. The subsumption of history under the general concept of art as a form of knowing, however, is attended by insuper able difficulties. Chief among these is the fact that the concrete to which history, that is, written history, is addressed is the existent concrete; but the images of art, patently, are unsuscept ible of the character of existence, save obliquely and typically. The forms of art, its images, are structures of pure quality, devoid of any determination of real and unreal, of any deter mination of existence, while the images of history are images of the real. But the character of existence cannot be intrinsic to any image, it cannot be simply a quality among qualities; it is rather the determination of quality to actuality which it does not possess simply as quality. The character of existence can not consequently pertain to the images of history as images but must accede to them by a further theoretical act beyond that by which the image is evoked. This further act can only be logical. Existence must enjoy the status of logical predicate, not of esthetic quality. This consideration alters profoundly history's own con ception of its theoretical character. If the characteristic of the image of history, that is, existence, pertains to it not as image, but in virtue of a further theoretical, logical act, history must be considered in its most intimate character to be, not art, but science. Its constitutive principle must be a logical act, a judg ment, and its operative principle, the concept, specifically, the "concept" of existence, which will appear in its constitutive judgment as logical predicate, and the subject of which must be the historical image. The intimate structure of history, con sequently, is logical. Yet insuperable difficulties would seem to attend this conclusion also. On the one hand the status of</page><page sequence="3">Philosophy and History 121 existence as a logical predicate is highly suspect, while on the other the character of its logical reference the image is ob scure. The appearance of existence as logical predicate would seem to involve its characterization as an essence, for logical predication consists precisely in the essential characterization of images. The reduction of existence to the state of an essence, however, nullifies the whole force of the logical persuasion of history; for essence assigns to the image merely a further formal characterization, and not actuality of its constitutive qualitative structure. The logical reference of existence to the image would consequently be purely formal and extrinsic, and not an intrinsic determination of the image to its actuality such as is demanded by the characteristic nature of the historical concrete. This tension within historiography, this bivalence, as it were, of written history toward concretion in the image on the one hand and on the other toward the abstraction and formality of the logical act or judgment; this intimately contradictory aspiration toward the status at once of art and of science, is the root of all its theoretical difficulties. Programatically, it can surrender neither of these prerogatives, yet logically cannot retain both. It can surrender its claim to logical struc ture only at the price of retirement from the theatre of the sciences into that realm of pure quality, innocent of any distinction of real and unreal, of any intimate character of existence, which would seem to be the realm of art. It can relinquish its claim to the status of art only at the price of the surrender of its precious and characteristic concretion, of fall ing into a dualism of allegory, or finally of retreating into a geometric method in which its only distinction from the ab straction of mathematics would be the peculiar ineptitude of its symbols. The deliverance of historiography from this theoretical quandary does not appear imminent, nor would its occurrence justify the program of historicism, that is, furnish an adequate basis for the projection of the philosophical problem of history.</page><page sequence="4">122 A. Robert Caponigri Rather the whole historiographie problem, when made the focus of the theoretical analysis of history, distorts and obscures the structure of the philosophical problem and must continue to do so until reassigned to the periphery of that analysis. Two indications of this fact, deriving directly from the theoretical quandary already noted, are especially persuasive. The first is the terminal estheticism which historiography can accept with serenity as proper to written history but which has no place in the philosophical concept of history. This estheticism is accepted by Croce, for example, when he writes without ambiguity that written history is contemplation. The basis of the contempla tive theory of written history is, obviously, its necessary orienta tion toward the image. Its inconsonance with a philosophical con cept of history is patent. History in its actuality is the theatre not of contemplation but of action; its intimate structure, con sequently, must be not esthetic but ethical. Somewhere within the ethical structure of history the contemplative moment of historiography must indeed find its place, but it cannot indicate or delineate the form of history. This terminal estheticism of historiography harbors a second element still more fatal to the projection of the phi losophical problem of history. This is the violent disorientation of the logical moment or act. In the process of giving logical structure to history, the concept was subordinated to the image as but one more formal determinant. In fact, however, the orientation of the concept and of the logical act is not toward the image as pure intuition but toward action, that is, toward the solicitation of actuality. The inner dynamic of the idea is not toward the determination of the image but toward the determination of the will in decision, not, therefore, back upon the self and an initial dream state, but outward upon nature and the real to be actualized, upon history as the public domain of existence. It is at this point also, that the proper relationship between the philosophical problem of history and the theoretical problems of historiography begin to appear. For once it is understood that the orientation of the logical act of the the oretical moment in general, is toward action, and not back upon</page><page sequence="5">Philosophy and History 123 itself or one of its immanent moments, it also becomes clear that the existence proper to historical reality is the term of economic and of ethical action and not of mere logical pre dication. The existence proper to the image of historiography is a derived, not a primary, existence. Historicism, consequently, that is, the attempt to project the philosophical problem of history from the ground of the theoretical problems of historiography, especially in the form of a theory of the historical judgment as the formal deter mination of the image to existence falls short of the minimal euristic demands of the philosophical problem of history, be cause the result of this effort is to throw the logical act back upon the realm of pure intuition rather than forward upon the theatre of action and decision. II The perspective fallacy of historicism has exercised a dominant, but not undisputed, sway over the theoretical aspects of history; it has been challenged at its most vital point by the philosophy of history. While the program of historicism has been the projection of the philosophical problem of history from the ground of the theoretical problems of historiography, the philosophy of history has consistently maintained the character of history as an order primarily of existence, not of knowing, and consequently that the writing of history must itself be predicated, either overtly or covertly, upon antecedent principles. These principles it has been the concern of the phi losophy of history to discover or to formulate, not simply as the preambles to historiography but rather as autonomous speculative concerns. Thus that complexus of theories which pass collectively under the title of philosophy of history would seem to possess a certain superiority over historicism because it is oriented toward history as a realm of existence and mean ing and is not inclined to confuse that realm with the specific problem of our knowledge of it. Nevertheless, the philosophy of</page><page sequence="6">124 A. Robert Caponigri history has in its turn consistently assumed fallacious points of view which wholely dissipate this advantage. Specifically, the philosophy of history has consistently fallen into a dual fallacy of reduction; on the one hand it has sought to reduce the concept of history to the concept of nature, on the other to the concept of spirit; in either case, of course, with the same concern, to secure history as a realm of meaning and existence. Overtly this fallacy has appeared principally in gnoseological form, that is, in answer to the question of the conditions of meaning in history and has, consequently, con sisted precisely in the attempt to bring history as a theatre of meaning within the limits of the gnoseological aspects of nature and spirit; in either case the thesis has been the same: history will have been established as a theatre of meaning, if the con ditions of meaning defined in the concepts of nature and spirit respectively can be shown to prevail in its case also. Since the order of meaning scarcely possesses autonomy, however, but tends consistently to revert to more primitive ontological terms, the overt gnoseological form of this fallacy conceals an onto logical substructure, that is, an ontological identification of history with nature or spirit. Basically, however, the fallacy is phenomenological, that is, it rests upon a phenomenological confusion of the order of history with nature and spirit. For purposes of criticism it is sufficient to restrict attention to the overt form of the fallacy, though it is clear that a euristic construction of the philosophical problem of history must extend and indeed take its point of departure in the problems which this overt form conceals. The attempt to bring history under the concept of nature as a theatre of meaning follows two chief lines. The first is the attempt to establish history as a theatre of causality in the gnoseological sense or dimension of this principle; the second, the attempt to fix history as an order of objects, to establish the objectivity of history on the same lines as the objectivity of nature. In both these procedures the phenomenological con fusion and the ontological identification of which mention has been made hover menacingly in the background.</page><page sequence="7">Philosophy and History 125 The naturalistic principle of causality is in the first instance an existential principle; that is, the primary reference of the principle of causality within the concept of nature is to existential natural process. The principle becomes a principle of meaning, in addition to and as a consequence of its existential character, when its primary terms are translated into terms of logical inference, and the necessity which constitutes its most intimate character is recognized to be logical necessity. This translation achieves the transformation of the blind interplay of the brute forces of nature into a theatre of meaning, significant, intellig ible and even intentional in its own right. To express this more concretely, we grasp the meaning of events and processes of nature only to the degree to which we grasp the logical, as distinct from the merely existential, necessity of their inter relation, only to the extent, that is, to which the existential ceases to appear simply as given. So clear is this to naturalistic theory that even to say that "a" is the cause of "b" in natural process is to profess the power to infer "b" from an adequate knowledge of "a" even in the absence of the existential process itself, so that the inferential structure "if a, then b", "if b, then a", becomes the classical type formula for the significent pene tration of natural process. The whole meaning of causality and of nature itself is translatable into this type formula, so that to have meaning in nature is nothing else than to fullfill this inferential structure. The nub of this thesis for the philosophical problem of history is the manner in which this translation from the exis tential to the logical level actually takes place. The form of this translation is fatal for history, or, more precisely, for a naturalistic philosophy of history. Logical necessity emerges from existential nexus only by the generalization of causes; as a consequence, in the order of natural causes, the force of in ference, that is, of logical necessity, decreases as the existential instance is approached and conversely increases as the system of inference recedes from the immediacy of the instance. This process rests upon a double abstraction, qualitative and tem poral. The necessity involved in logical inference between</page><page sequence="8">126 A. Robert Caponigri cause and effect is timeless or, more precisely, rests upon a temporal abstraction; to grasp the meaning of natural process in terms of causal inference is precisely to refer the temporal apparition of existential relations to a temporal principle. Thus the time factor, although as a matter of fact actually consti tutive and determinative of natural existential process, is lo gically irrelevant or tangential and does not enter into the inter pretable meaning of the process. That natural event "x", struc tualized causally into the existential stasis "a" and antithesis "b" and logically into the form "a therefore b" transpired at time "t" is not part of the meaning of intelligibility of "x"; and this even in view of the fact that natural causal process trans pires wholly in time so that existentially to be in nature is to be in time. Causality as a principle of logical necessity and consequently of meaning is thus general with respect to the distribution of natural process in time. Similarly, the logical necessity of the naturalistic prin ciple of causality rests upon abstraction from the qualitative richness of existence. The quantification of all causal relations becomes the condition of their logical structure. The richness of the qualitative world, in Hegel's powerful phrase, we take upon ourselves and relegate to a realm of pure subjectivity, that is to a world of existential but non-logical relationship. These strategies to which naturalism has in the past been put in order to translate mere events into intelligible causal relations according to a rule of logical inference have occasioned considerable perturbation among naturalists themselves. They contain the seeds of the formalization of science which has been proceeding relentlessly for centuries. When applied to the interpretation of historical process, they appear clearly self defeating. Time and qualitative determination are not the ac cidents, but the intimate substance of historical transaction. The detemporalization and qualitative impoverishment of his torical process annihilates it, rather than renders it meaningful or intelligible. The general causes of which the naturalist can speak and with which he can rest content within the purview of</page><page sequence="9">Philosophy and History 127 his preoccupations, clearly possess no logical force in history pre cisely because it is the temporal and qualitative dimensions of the historical event and process which demand clarification. The historical process is totally concretion, temporally and qualitatively and as a theatre of meaning cannot leave these conditions of concretion behind. If general causes are operative in history under the guise of natural factors they operate, as Turgot pointed out long ago, only through conscious concre tion, that is through the human spirit, as it is~4tself temporally and qualitatively distributed. Any attempt to construct the gnoseological theory of history on the basis of logical necessity as it is developed in the concept of nature has the result only of distorting the intimate structure of history and of trans lating its qualitatively rich and temporally distributed drama into the pale dialectic of abstractions on the grey field of an eternity which is history's negation, not its fulfilment. The fallacy of reductive naturalism appears again in the philosophy of history under the guise of the problem of the objectivity of history. The import of the fallacy from this point of view is that historical events and processes, from the gnose ological point of view, occupy the same transcendent referen ces as do the objects of natural science and that, consequently, the canon for meaning in history must be identical with that of a realistic naturalism, namely, the conformity of idea with object. The root of the fallacy in this respect is clearly the imitative theory of knowledge to which naturalism, in its own area quite rightly no doubt, is committed. The extension of this theory to the area of history on the basis of mere analogy is a clear case of a phenomenological confusion which erupts on the gnoseological level. It is phenomenologically impossible to reduce the historical event or form; it is consequently at this level that the fallacy of historical objectivity must be met. The assertion of the phenomenological incommensurabi lity of historical and natural forms appears readily compre hensible in the light of almost any chance example; the work of art is especially impressive in this respect. For that the work</page><page sequence="10">128 A. Robert Caponigri of art in its precise character as art is not a natural form nor its existential conditions those of natural objects or events is patent. Conversely, the history of esthetics from Aristotle for ward illustrate again and again the impasse into which all attempts to deal with the work of art naturalistically, that is, as an object, are forced. Such attempts result in the annihila tion of the work of art in precisely its artistic character and its replacement with some naturalistic substitute such as a psychology, an ideology, an economics or a sociology of art. What is here illustrated by the case of the work of art is more generally true of all historical forms. Essentially in commensurable with natural forms, historical forms resist reduc tion to natural at the phenomeological level. Their confusion with such forms results in the pseudo-problem of the objecti vity of history and the second form of the naturalistic philoso phy of history. The reductive fallacy appears again in the philosophy of history in the subsumption of history under the concept of spirit. In this subsumption it is asserted that the conditions of mean ing in history are reducible to the conditions of meaning in the concept of spirit. Formally, this reduction of history to spirit is identical with the naturalistic form of this fallacy but has arisen in dialectical opposition to the naturalistic form. The attempt to subsume history under the concept of spirit has been motivated by the desire to preserve history from those contradictions into which the naturalistic fallacy plunges it; its result, however, is to expose history to new dangers and difficulties no easier, perhaps even more difficult, to disengage. The concept of spirit is rooted in the rich humanistic tra dition of western thought. Specifically, it arose in answer to man's need to articulate his sense of transcendence over the necessities and fatalities of nature. Consequently, it has pro gressively defined itself in the terms in which that transcendence most vividly impresses itself upon him, namely liberty and consciousness. Just as the dynamic of naturalism has been toward the darkness of utter necessity, so the dynamic of the</page><page sequence="11">Philosophy and History 129 self-definition of spirit has been in the direction of creative self-conscious idea, a dynamism which may easily override the humanism in which it has its origins. Spirit has its initial moment of self-definition in the rejec tion of the imitative theory of knowledge so identified with naturalism. Spirit first enunciated itself in the history of thought in the assertion of the creative character of thought, of the identity of subject and object; this assertion arose when first it was sensed that nature is spirit's own shadow which in its initial ingenuousness it mistakes for substance. The creative character of thought carries with it the identification of mean ing as the self-discovery of spirit in its free generation of forms. For this reason, spiritualistic attitudes have assigned a high gnoseological value to art, for it is in art that they discover the cell of all significance. Art is the stumbling block of natura lism, but it is the keystone of spiritualism. The final enunciation of spirit is freedom or liberty, which is synonymous with creati vity itself. By it man, idea, reality are released from nature's dark necessities, from its bondage, from its inevitabilities. Over against nature, in terms of its own freedom and creativity, spirit may write large the meaning of life in terms which at every point give the lie to the dark deliverances of natural necessity. In its initial rejection of nature, whose processes are de ployed through time and constitute the substance of time, the tendency of spirit is to reject time and process along with nature and to retreat into the recesses of undifferentiated unity and self-identity. This is the plotinian moment of transcendent absolutism and in a certain sense would seem to constitute the ultimate self-enunciation of spirit. Actually, however, this is the contradiction of spirit. This negation of time and process within spirit is intimately contradicted by human spirit. Man as spirit is conscious of transcending nature not absolutely, but relatively, not out of time, but in time, in a word, not by the transcendence, but in the creation of history. Thus it is that the conception of history as a realm of meaning in terms of the transcendence of spirit over nature</page><page sequence="12">130 A. Robert Caponigri emerges. History is the substance of that transcendence; it is the transformation which spirit works in the bosom of nature and in response to the challenging limitations and necessities of nature. Nature on every hand presses upon man with its necessities, its fatalities, its inevitabilities, defining in an iron ring of circumstance the limits of meaning; but the necessi ties of nature are the death of spirit. At every point, conse quently, spirit counters the definition of nature by the genera tion of its proper forms of self-consciousness which, in the words of Paul, transmute death into victory. Thus history as a realm of meaning emerges as the enunciations of self-con scious spirit in defiance of the necessities and limitations of nature. Over against brute power, spirit defines right and polity is born. Over against the commotion and the unilatera lity of passion, spirit defines the ideal, and serene art is born bringing with it the transformation of passion itself into joy in the beautiful. Thus every element in the phenomenology of history, that tight complexus of conscious forms which resist with all their inward power reduction to nature and compose the historical awareness of man: laws, arts, social institutions, takes on significance as the progressive self-enunciations of spirit in the face of nature. Conversely, spirit finds its own concrete reality and definition precisely in these forms, for the transcendence of spirit over nature is but a waking dream until translated into these historical concretions. History in this way becomes not merely an order of meaning generated by spirit but the concrete definition of spirit and its substance; for spirit lives and is actual only in those moments of the con crete transcendence of nature: in the just deed and law, in the well wrought form of art, in the aspiration toward life absolute and unconditioned. Finally this transcendence is rendered complete by the dissolution of nature into the negative moment of spirit, into the realization by spirit that it defines itself not over against the substance of a real world standing over against it in self-sufficient subsistence, but over against its own non-being. Nature having been thus swallowed up in his tory, history becomes the inward process whereby spirit sue</page><page sequence="13">Philosophy and History 131 cessively transcends not nature, but itself, in every moment of its concretion. The deployment of spirit through time is the condition of its self transcendence and not a limit imposed by a dark and alien power. It is in this last and extreme enunciation, logically implicit in the concept of spirit when that concept is detached from its humanistic moorings, that the fallacy of the reduction of history to spirit becomes apparent. For with the resolution of nature into spirit, the rationale of spirit itself disappears and with it the possibility of significent history. For with the dissipation of nature the laws by which spirit deploys itself into absolute history lose their freedom and take on a character of necessity indistinguishible from the necessities of nature. The freedom which is the essence of spirit is realized in the transcendence of nature and without nature as a real and sub sistent point d'appui loses its specific character. Its temporal process, history, becomes indistinguishible from natural process. This is the reason why in the history of thought the hard bolus of natural necessity has tended to reassert itself in the bosom of all spiritualisms which lose their humanistic cast and the concrete reason why the reduction of historical process to the self-articulation of spirit is destructive of history alike as a realm of meaning and of form. Ill These considerations would seem to make one fact trans parently clear: heretofore the formulation of the philosophical problem of history has foundered upon the rocks of alien sup position. Successive and often repeated attempts to formulate this problem, now on suppositions proper to historiography, again on those proper to the concept of nature, and finally on grounds of the concept spirit have proved uniformly self defeating. As a consequence, disengagement from these alien suppositions becomes the first euristic condition for the phi losophical problem of history.</page><page sequence="14">132 A. Robert Caponigri Such disengagement would at first appear to be a negative dialectical process; as a fact, however, it can be accomplished finally only by a positive enunciation of the supposition proper to the problem of history. This positive disengagement must consist in the formulation of euristic canons which will on the one hand prevent the intrusion of alien supposition into the formulation of the problem and on the other describe the fun damental lineaments of the autonomous concept of history, by making clear the basic material supposition within which the problem of history arises. A further euristic condition is suggested by the reflection that alien suppositions have entered the formulation of the phi losophical problem of history invariably at the phenomenological level. They have gained access and plausibility because of the confusion which has always existed in even the descriptive account of historical forms. Here the power of analogy has been overwhelming and precisely because it has proven so fruitful in the history of thought in other respects has out weighed the otherwise clear necessity for an unambiguous des criptive disengagement of historical forms. That historical struc tures or forms are not forms of nature or spirit would appear easily comprehensible; as a matter of fact, however, the dis tinction is not readily granted, or if granted, is immediately nullified. As a consequence, the primary euristic condition of the philosophical problem of history is further refined: a canon which operates for the unambiguous discernment of historical from other forms at the descriptive or phenomenological level. To this end, a bulwark must first of all be erected against the overpowering solicitation of analogy. This bulwark is readily provided by a canon of irreducibility. Such a canon might well be formulated in something of the following man ner: the characterization of the phenomena of history, of histo rical forms in their descriptive aspects, may bear an analogous, but only an analogous relation in denotation and connotation of terms to the characterization of any other order of pheno mena, such, for example, as those of nature, or of spirit; further,</page><page sequence="15">Philosophy and History 133 where possible this analogy should be one only of simple pro portionality. In this manner, any reduction of historical forms to non-historical even at the descriptive level becomes impos sible, while the powerful aid of analogy is still retained. The force of this canon must be to preclude those fallacies which result in the explanation of history in terms borrowed from other theatres of discourse and other structures of meaning. Nevertheless, the canon of irreducibility is but a negative rule, for it provides no basis for the positive characterization of historical structures even at the descriptive levels, save perhaps by a system of residues. It must be complemented by a positive canon of equal or greater force, which might secure the char acterization of historical forms in positive terms. Such a canon is to be found in the time-form relationship. Abstractly, and in the character of a descriptive rule, the time-form canon may thus be stated: those forms belong to history whose characterization demands the inclusion of the time factor not as extrinsic and formal, but as intrinsic and constitutive. The force of this canon is readily seen as it operates to enforce and re-enforce the canon of irreducibility with respect to the phenomena of nature. The unambiguous character of natural form is timelessness; or, more accurately, time enters natural form as extrinsic and formal, not as intrinsic and consti tutive. Processes of nature, consequently, which are subject only to the law of indefinite repeatability are clearly excluded from the order of historical phenomena, while a positive crite rion for the descriptive and constitutive time, is provided. The canon is seen to operate with equal force in the direction of the clear distinction of the phenomena of history from those of spirit. It is obviously most doubtful whether deployment through time is an essential dimension of con sciousness as such; an assertion that it must be, might well represent a persistent anthropomorphism. For while it is true that human consciousness is subject to a dialectic and thus is intimately constituted of time-form, this can be taken to mean</page><page sequence="16">134 A. Robert Caponigri only that man belongs to history (or more accurately, that history belongs to man) and that to the degree to which spirit is characterizable absolutely in terms of consciousness, time is not an absolute character of spirit. In a word, humanistic spiritualism may perhaps be abortive, and human history cannot exhaust the concept of spirit. However, it is not thus abstractly and dialectically, that the time-form canon is finally justified. Rather, its power is revealed as an instrument for the erection of a concrete pheno menology of history. Conformity to the time-form canon is the single infallible note of historical structures and by this note the concrete content of history is unambiguously identified. By this canon the area or field of historical forms is irreducibly distinguished on the one hand from the forms of nature and on the other from those of spirit, from absolute or transcendent ideas or essences. Nevertheless, this power as an instrument for the descriptive phenomenology of history, does not exhaust the time-form canon; it is further the chief instrument for the analysis of the concrete content of the field of historical forms. The employment of the time-form canon as an analytic rather than merely as a descriptive instrument, brings into focus a further dimension of the philosophical problem: the gnoseological. As an instrument of analysis, the time-form canon is directed toward the isolation of the primary consti tive principle of historical structures. The immediate result of this application is the conclusion that form in historical struc tures is primarily a category of meaning or intention. Historical forms, civil institutions, for example, art, or the sciences them selves, regarded even abstractly are opaque to any penetration or comprehension save in terms of meaning or intention. They resist, on the one hand, treatment as objects of contemplation, that is as eternal ideas or essenses, and on the other hand, dynamic and pragmatic analysis. The structure of Roman civil law, or of a concrete work of art, resists, on the one hand, con templative construction, for in neither can the mind rest as in the absolute idea either of justice or of beauty; equally on the</page><page sequence="17">Philosophy and History 135 other hand do they resist a pragmatic or practicalistic con struction, for both are theoretical discernments, not structures of power. They respond only to analysis as structures of mean ing or intent; structures in which theoretical discernment passes over into dynamic and practical transformation of a material. The peculiar character of historical forms as structures of meaning or intent is the entrance of time into the constitution of these structures precisely as intentional and significant. Unlike natural forms as structures of meaning, the forms of history demand deployment through time as the absolute con dition of significance. The ideal discernment which is an intrinsic principle of the historical form is such that it demands time as the theatre of its significance. It is never an instantial and self contained intuition whose subsequent deployment is tautolo gical. When reduced to such intuition, the ideal discernment of time-form becomes sterilely abstract and self-denying. Witness is born to this truth by the fallacy of primitivism as well as by the complementary fallacy of utopianism; both, while pre tending to be historical interpretations, actually constitute the negation of the time element of historical form and hence of history itself. History then as the province of time-form immediately involves the first speculative question of the philosophical problem of history, namely, the character and conditions of meaning in time. This, frankly, is a problem with which western thought has dealt only obliquely. Its initial gnoseological insight has held the conditions of meaning to be timeless, and western thought has been faithful to this insight. When confronted with the problem of meaning and time in any of its aspects it has tended to adopt a strategy of reduction resolving the time aspect into some form of continuity of generality. The gnoseology of time-form is not, however the ultimate question involved in the phenomenology of history; behind it lies the ontology of historical forms. Meaning is a medial term; its anchors are in the forms of being, and it demands conversion into these terms. The problem of historical existence, that is,</page><page sequence="18">136 A. Robert Caponigri the problem of the existential conditions and implications of time-form structures of meaning, looms as the terminal question of the philosophical problem of history. The concrete form of this problem is the relation between thought and action, be tween meaning and existence, between intent and decision. For it would seem immediately evident that the only term which can relate meaning to existence or, more properly, which can fulfill meaning in existence is will or decision. These consequently would seem to constitute the three pivotal questions about which the complex philosophical problem of history must be constructed. It is in terms of these questions alone that the philosophical problem of history can be formu lated without the intrusion of nullifying alien suppositions. It is along the lines of the solution of these questions that speculative penetration of historical actuality may be hoped for, and the actualization of the desire for a fresh rapprochement between history and philosophy so keenly felt by contemporary culture may be secured.
