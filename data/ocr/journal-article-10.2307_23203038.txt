<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZADKINE'S WIT: HOMAGE TO PA UL ELUARD Avigdor W. G. Poseq Comedy is usually associated with verbal puns, epigrams, funny pictures, and carica tures, but sculpture, which more easily co habits with memorials and sublime monu ments, is seldom used as a vehicle for wit. Jokes, like idioms, do not translate well, and their transposition to another medium often degenerates into nonsense. Since sculptural equivalents of witty metaphors are especially difficult, few sculptors have been interested in attempting it. Cubist and Surrealist endeavors to treat sculpture as concrete poetry have some times resulted in absurdities that, even though they are incidental rather than delib erate, represent a special category of hu mor. To illustrate, let us consider the statue Poet, which Ossip Zadkine created in 1952-1953 in homage to his friend, French poet Paul Eluard, then recently deceased. If we expect a dignified memorial, we are due for a surprise, for Zadkine portrays Eluard as an outlandish human-sized mannequin composed of seemingly unrelated elements. The head has two faces; the torso is a dis carded piece of machinery; the upper limbs are cast from tree trunks and branches, some of which are sprouting twigs; the legs seem to be hewn out of inorganic matter, and one foot has the shape of a mechanical gadget while the other is a monstrous bird's claw. Each part is also densely covered with engraved writing (Fig. I).1 One can appreciate Zadkine's wish to honor the avant-garde poet with a modernistic monu ment, but at first sight the bizarre statue could be mistaken for an oversized Pinoc chio.2 The contrast between the statue's physical reality and its solemn purpose seems like deliberate persiflage. But there is more to this figure than meets the eye. We may start with its marionettelike structure. In a famous study of the causes of laughter, Bergson notes the burlesque effect of comparing persons to mechanical and inanimate objects. He claims that the child's spontaneous delight in movable gadgets and the adult's pleasure in automa tion and automata are similar to artifices suggesting the "mechanization of life."3 Bergson explains that the reaction to a substitution of the artificial for the natural, or even a mere suggestion of such meta morphosis, is comparable to that aroused by caricatural distortions.4 The effect also corresponds to the twisting of meaning re sulting from the frivolous understanding of verbal metaphors, pretending that figurative expressions mean precisely what they say.5 Such incongruities are not restricted to the literary genre. If one assumes a reference to facts, even simple, everyday phrases—" So and-so flourishes" or "droops" or "has lost heart" or "has acted like a robot"— seem like jokes. The literal illustration of such metaphors visually, as in cartoons or comics, is even more ridiculous. This effect may be discerned in ostensibly nonhumor ous portraits: it is only thanks to habit that we fail to respond to the absurdity of a person being portrayed on a flat piece of paper or by stone. However, the replace ment of conventional artistic media by an other technique—for example, an assem</page><page sequence="2">32 Fig. 1 0. Zadkine, Poet: Homage to Paul Eluard. 1952-1935. Bronze. The Hebrew University, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem blage of machine parts—highlights the paradox of identifying a human being with a lifeless thing. The effect is especially sug gestive when, as in the case of Zadkine's Poet, a bizarre mannequin purports to rep resent a distinguished individual. The composite structure of the Poet brings to mind Arcimboldo's fantastic por traits, composed of assorted mechanical and vegetative elements or of everyday objects that seem to convey witty visual puns. For instance, Librarian is portrayed as a man made of books. Arcimboldo's proto-Surrealistic idiom reflects the con temporary interest in Egyptian hiero glyphic, which at that time was thought to be a secret, rcbuslike script.6 The purpose of some of Arcimboldo's works have been shown to be that of paying solemn homage to his patrons at the imperial courts of Prague and Vienna. The personification of Fire, composed of firearms, glorifies the power of the Austrian artillery (Fig. 2).7 Only when the political message is forgot ten can such pictures be seen as humorous capricci. Zadkine's Poet, densely inscribed with quotations from Eluard's writings, also seems like a rebus. Like Arcimboldo's alle gory, the statue is subject to quid pro quo. The tribute to Eluard turns into farce; its ambiguity is a result of the literal rendering of verbal metaphors. The figure, meant to convey the idea that Eluard is a "man of poetry," can also be understood as an ironic comment that "poetry makes the poet." Eluard's vocation is indicated by his at tributes. In his hand, he holds some written pages and a large instrument evoking the classical lyre of Orpheus. However, since this instrument is only half a lyre, it seems like a witty adaptation of the mythic poet</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2 G. Arcimboldo, Fire. c. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna musician s attribute to a later-day poet was not a musician.8 Although Eluard also was celebrated as a great lover, he was a poet of his time. His political message is documented by the texts engraved on the statue. The eye is drawn to the word "Liberte" ("Freedom") inscribed on the leaflet that the figure holds in his hand. It is the title and the key word of Eluard's most famous poem, written during the German occupation to bolster the French morale and clandestinely dropped as leaflets from British airplanes. Expressing his passionate longing for freedom, Eluard says that he inscribes it "on the attuned flesh, on the forehead ... on each hand stretched out."9 By engraving these lines on the Poet, Zadkine pretends that Eluard meant precisely what he said. Other verses are taken from Eluard's autobiographical poem "Mes heures" ("My Hours"), where, in describing the earlier phases of his career, he says that he was "a man, and a rock, and was a rock in man, man in rock ... a bird in the air, and space in the bird"; but finally he became a tree—along his branches the leaves are now reborn—and his way is crowned in sunny happiness.10 The allusion to wayfaring is reflected in the fact that, in contradiction to the conventional concept of a memorial as a timeless and essentially static monument, the Poet is walking. The suggestion of peri patetic movement was adapted from Rodin's Man Walking and Saint John the Baptist.11 The latter statue was also the prototype of the Poet's rhetorical gesture, suggesting that Eluard was the precursor of</page><page sequence="4">34 freedom. But the stiff, mechanical rendering of the gesture assumes the trappings of comic parody. The metaphorical ambivalence of Eluard's self-presentation as "rock in man, man in rock" must have reminded Zadkine of the ambiguity of Epstein's anthropomor phic Rock Drill (Fig. 3).12 Zadkine prob ably saw this remarkable objet trouve, consisting of a discarded pneumatic drill whose motor has been removed, when it was first shown in London in 1913. In emulating the robotlike effect, Zadkine may have wished to define Eluard as a poet of the Machine Age, but the result also sug gests additional meanings. Epstein pre sented the Rock Drill as a Frankensteinian monster into which modern man has trans formed himself. The critics went even fur ther, observing that since Rock Drill had no motor, the work was an allegory of dehu manization, a metaphor of the incapacity to feel.13 This idea may also be applied to Zadkine's Poet, whose hollow breast con tains no heart. The motif evoking the saying that the body is a machine and the heart is a motor conveys the idea of the deadening of poetic inspiration. In view of the reference on the leaflet to the wartime suffering, the empty breast may be seen as a consequence of political oppression; but it could also be understood as an allusion to Eluard's un happy love and the loss of his beloved Gala, who deserted him for Salvador Dali. Zadkine s method of pretending that ver bal expressions mean what they say is evi dent in his rendering of Eluard's image of the leaves reborn along his branches—he shows new twigs shooting out of the wooden members of the Poet's body. The allegory of self-renewal, which in this con text is identified with the liberation of France, may be traced to the biblical tree of Jesse. But its literal rendering in the com Fig. 3 J. Epstein, Rock Drill. 1913. Bronze. Tate Gallery, London posite statue has a comic effect, made even more incongruous by the fact that the walking man-tree seems uprooted from its native habitat.14 Another literal interpretation of a poetic metaphor—in this case, Eluard's saying that before he became a tree he was a bird—may be discerned in the Poet's foot, which is shaped like a bird's claw. The hybrid anatomy evokes the composite Mesopotamian demons—half man, half bird15—which, in the guise of winged grif fins, were later adopted as iconographic symbols of Christ's nature, both human and divine.16 Zadkine forwent the wings, but his Poet also conveys a duality. The juxtaposi</page><page sequence="5">35 tion of the bird's talon with the mechanical foot was probably meant to show that Eluard combined heaven-given poetic inspi ration with modem realities. However, in medieval and in popular iconography, the talon is a traditional attribute of the devil.17 The claw-footed Poet, curiously reminis cent of the demonization of Orpheus in Christian lore,18 may be understood as a witty allusion to the devilish seductiveness of Eluard's poetry and perhaps even of Eluard himself I could add observations on the farcical results of Zadkine's transposition of poetic idioms, but I must also note that the comic effect of the statue is not restricted to the translation of verbal metaphors. The com posite figure also shows some humorous aspects specific to its own medium. One of them is the fact that the Surrealist style that Zadkine employed in this work was origi nally devised to liberate sculpture from its subservience to literature. Here, the non realist forms are combined with poetic writings. Even more incongruous is the as semblage structure of the Poet's body. The technique of creating works of art out of objets trouves is a device by which modern sculptors stress the nonrepresentational character of their compositions. But in Zadkine, the components are cast from nature, and, therefore, the statue exhibits the most exacting type of sculptural imita tion. However, the mimetic rendering of the objects is compromised by the fantastic effect of the figure as a whole. Although vaguely anthropomorphic, it is not lifelike, the Poet's head, which allegedly bears some resemblance to Eluard, shows a curious combination of profile and frontal views. The comic effect of this portrait derives not only from the strange physiognomical de formation or from the possible idiomatic implications of the "double face," but from the fact that the combination of en face and profile is a well-known graphic device that Cubist painters employ in planar represen tation of tridimensional objects. To a per son familiar with modern art, the use of the Cubist formula in a fully three-dimensional statue seems like a sophisticated "in"-joke. Although the vehicle and content of sculptural wit in certain cases may be spe cific to that medium, sculptural jokes are no less funny than conventional comic genres. Thus, not only may sculpture be a suitable vehicle for banter, but a careful analysis of the ostensibly serious works of contempo rary sculpture may in some cases reveal un expected—and partially unintentional—far cical contents.
