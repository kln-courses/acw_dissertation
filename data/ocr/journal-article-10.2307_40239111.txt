<plain_text><page sequence="1">"We are not made for revelation": Letters to Francis Bacon in the Postscript to J. M. Coetzee's Elizabeth Costello Dirk Klopper The postscript follows the signature of the letter or the text of the book. As an addition to a communication that has already taken place, it gestures to the inconclusiveness of the writing, its failure of closure. It is an afterthought that paradoxically draws attention to itself, simultaneously marking and transgressing the limits of language. While peripheral to the body of the already written text, it is rendered emphatic precisely through this very separation, where, from beyond the margins, it fills a gap, accentuates a point, provides a new angle, a fresh observation, opening up the text to further elaboration.1 In J. M. Coetzee's Elizabeth Costello, the paradox of the postscript is incorporated into the meaning of the work itself. Anterior to and excluded from the narrative, it speaks to the issues raised in the narrative from another place. The narrative concerns the fictional writer Elizabeth Costello in her role as public intellectual, delivering lectures, conducting seminars, giving interviews. Throughout the eight lessons that are structured around these various engagements, Costello pronounces on a range of questions, including the mode of literary representation and the task of the writer, the subject as simultaneously embodied and transcendent, and the relation between truth and desire. In the opening paragraphs of the first lesson, "Realism," the third person narrator draws attention to the fictional status of the work through his explicit references to characterisation and plot as bridging devices into the narrative world. Once this narrative world has been put in place, the self- reflexive references to fictional devices are abandoned and the narrative subsequently sustains the illusion that it describes an actual person, deals English in Africa 35 No. 2 (October 2008): 1 19-132</page><page sequence="2">120 DIRK KLOPPER with real-life experiences and issues, and is set in geographically identifiable locations. In other words, the narrative projects the illusion of realism. It is only in the concluding lesson, "At the Gate," that the narrative again makes explicit its fictional status, when Elizabeth Costello finds herself written into a literary context and is called upon to provide an account of herself as writer. Allowed a glimpse through the gate to what, presumably, lies on the other side of her fictional life, she sees only bright light, the unimaginable beyond, devoid of distinguishing features. In short, the narrative pursues the real even as it discloses its own fictiveness. Much of its concern, in fact, is with what is real and how the real may be accessed in language, given that language steps back from the real in order to provide a representation of it. As intimated by the title of the first lesson, the narrative approaches the problematic of language through the notion of realism, but it also approaches this problematic, less obviously perhaps, through the notion of allegory. If realism is the subject of the first lesson, then allegory is the mode of the last lesson, which adapts to its own purpose Kafka's parable "Before the Law." The narrative thus begins with realism and ends with allegory. The full significance of the notions of realism and allegory to the problematic of language only emerges, however, in the postscript. On the face of it, the postscript is not part of the narrative of Elizabeth Costello. It takes the form of a letter written by a Lady Elizabeth Chandos to Francis Bacon on 11 September 1603, as follow-up to an earlier letter written by her husband Lord Chandos. It is a postscript in the strict sense of the term as addition or a sequel to an existing letter. Nevertheless, the postscript is anomalous in having been written not by the author of the first letter, the husband, but by the wife, who writes on behalf of the husband and without his knowledge, usurping his prerogative and depriving him, if not of his authority, then at least of having the last word. Moreover, it is an addition not to one but to two texts. It is a postscript to the narrative of Elizabeth Costello, and the name that appears at the end of the letter, Elizabeth C, indicates an obvious correspondence with the name Elizabeth C (ostello). But it is also a sequel to the letter of Lord Chandos, an excerpt of which is provided as basis for it. Elizabeth Costello steps out of the text in which she has been written in the third person to write a postscript to a narrative that has been about her. Yet the first person persona she adopts is not her own as Elizabeth Costello but that of Elizabeth Chandos, who writes a postscript to a letter her husband Lord Chandos had written. In so doing, Costello repeats a narrative strategy she had employed in her celebrated novel The House on Eccles Street, where she had written a sequel to Joyce's Ulysses from the point of Molly Bloom,</page><page sequence="3">LETTERS TO FRANCIS BACON 1 2 1 liberated from the house to which Joyce had confined her. In the postscript she gives voice to another silent partner, the wife of Lord Chandos, while simultaneously distancing herself from the narrative to which she herself had been confined by her author. The Lady Chandos letter responds to an epistolary fiction by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, "The letter of Lord Chandos to Lord Bacon," published in 1902. While the latter is a fictional letter, its citation in Elizabeth Costello is not to an imaginary object but to an actual letter that has an existence independent of the text in which it is cited. The fictional Elizabeth Costello assumes the voice of a fictional Lady Chandos in providing a sequel to a fictional letter purported to have been written on 22 August 1603 by a fictional Lord Chandos to the real Francis Bacon, but which was in fact written in 1902 by the real Hofmannsthal to the literati of his day. The effect of these referential displacements is to set up a dizzying play in which an object, the Lord Chandos letter referred to in the postscript, is both a fiction and a real item in the world. Hofmannsthal' s "Letter" announces itself as "the letter Philip, Lord Chandos, younger son of the Earl of Bath, wrote to Francis Bacon, later Baron Verulam, Viscount St. Albans, apologizing for his complete abandonment of literary activity" (Hofmannsthal I).2 In it, Lord Chandos explains that he has relinquished literature because he has lost faith in the generalising and abstracting qualities of language, and that he has come instead to value the authenticity and fullness of immediate sensual experience. Critics have identified Hofmannsthal's "Letter" as a key statement that proclaims modernism's crisis of language.3 Inasmuch as Costello's "Letter of Lady Chandos" is a postscript to the "Letter of Lord Chandos," it is also a postscript, then, to modernism. Engaging with this crisis of language, and drawing into its ambit the issues of embodiment and transcendence, realism and allegory, the very issues addressed by the lessons in the novel, the postscript is an afterthought but also an underwriting, providing belated insight into how the narrative itself constitutes an engagement with modernism. The excerpt provided in Elizabeth Costello of the Lord Chandos letter describes an experience where ordinary phenomena, a dog or a tree or a stone, reveal themselves with extraordinary fullness of what Chandos calls "love" and "meaning" (Coetzee 226). In her letter, Lady Chandos refers to this experience of intensified feeling and heightened meaning as an "affliction" (227), a mental torment that destabilises the relation between self and world. Significantly, she does not contest the experience itself. Whereas Chandos embraces ecstatic being, even though he acknowledges this state as a "malady" that renders thought and speech inoperable</page><page sequence="4">122 DIRK KLOPPER (Hofmannsthal 1), his wife rejects ecstatic being, even though she acknowledges the pleasures of this state. Lady Chandos does not question either the premise or the validity of ecstatic being. Her concern lies with its effects. She experiences the ecstasy along with her husband, and recognises the way in which its sheer excess breaks free of the constraints of language. But this is exactly the problem. For her, such freedom from the stabilising relations of language is interminable torment. Hence her appeal to Francis Bacon, because he is said to select his words and set them in place and build judgements "as a mason builds a wall with bricks" (Coetzee 230). This pragmatic use of language, as an instrument to perform operations in the real world, to create fixed and durable locations for human habitation, is precisely what, for Lady Chandos, is lacking in the ecstatic experience. Critics have tended to attribute the significance of Francis Bacon in the Chandos letters to his standing as early proponent of a scientific world view fundamentally at odds with the literary imagination.4 But this argument is too simplistic in its opposition of science and literature. It overlooks the fact that the Lord Chandos letter responds to Bacon's approval of the literary "projects" his friend Chandos had entertained in the past and his solicitude concerning Chandos's current withdrawal from literary activity. The choice of Bacon as recipient of these letters is interesting not because his philosophical position excludes the literary imagination but because his philosophical position has both scientific and literary consequences. He inhabits an historical period in which the divisions between domains of knowledge had not yet come to assume irreconcilable points of view.5 The figuration of Francis Bacon in these letters cannot simply be reduced, then, to a foil against which Hofmannsthal's opposing argument is directed. His position is more complex than this and speaks directly to the problematic of language addressed in the letters. While it is true that Bacon advocates a form of inductive scientific reasoning, which proceeds from empirical observation of nature to the elaboration of axioms and laws, he arrives at this method precisely because he acknowledges the limitations of intellectual knowledge, encapsulated in what he calls the four "idols" of perceptual illusion, personal bias, dogmatic authority, and linguistic confusion (Honderich 75). In other words, he seeks a form of understanding that is true to experience itself, one that begins with the particular instance as basis of the general conception, an approach which is not necessarily incompatible with the literary. In fact, it could be argued that from the Renaissance onwards there have been writers who have explicitly endeavoured to produce a form of understanding that is as close as possible to experience, periodically renouncing the habits of literary convention to get at the thing itself. This is true of Wordsworth the romanticist as much as</page><page sequence="5">LETTERS TO FRANCIS BACON 1 23 it is of Woolf the modernist. If we are going to argue that the scientific and the literary are diametrically opposed modes of knowledge, then we need to be more discerning about the scientific and literary paradigms employed to substantiate this argument.6 Francis Bacon is a sceptic, putting in doubt received forms of knowledge, testing ideas against the evidence of the senses, evincing suspicion of the deceptions of language. His friend Chandos simply exhibits an extreme form of this attitude, invoking doubt about the efficacy of any existing language whatsoever. This renders him unable "to think or to speak of anything coherently," while providing access, he says, to a "mysterious, wordless, and boundless ecstasy" (Hofmannsthal 5). In other words, the doubt from which Lord Chandos suffers leaves him incapable of using conventional language as an organizing and integrating system of relations: "For me everything disintegrated into parts, those parts again into parts; no longer would anything let itself be encompassed by one idea" (3). This loss of ability to contain experience in language and subject it to a unifying idea indicates a failure of conceptualisation, of abstraction, of generalisation. Nevertheless, this failure of conceptualisation enables Chandos to respond directly and intimately to phenomena themselves: "To me, then, it is as though my body consists of nought but ciphers which give me the key to everything; or as if we could enter into a new and hopeful relationship with the whole of exist- ence if only we begin to think with the heart" (4). It is not so much that language has been lost, but that it has ceased to categorise and structure the world in a particular way. The potential to symbolise remains, but the symbols are now indeterminate, seeking to take in the whole of existence and to open up multiple significations. While Bacon turns to experience to stabilise meaning, Chandos finds in experience an open-ended meaning. For Chandos, thinking and symbolisation have come to emanate directly from the body, from the sensation of concrete experience rather than from intellectual abstraction. Bodily sensations have themselves taken on a signifying function, and what the body signifies offers an intuitive relation with the world, a relation that is premised on feeling and empathy, and that begins, as Chandos puts it, when we "think with the heart." Chandos uses the word "ciphers" to denote these signifying markers of the body. A cipher is at once a zero, a nothing, a nonentity, as well as a secret mode of writing. It is simultaneously less than a conventional signifier, emptied of signification, and more than a conventional signifier, reaching beyond the limits of language. Chandos describes his relationship with the world as "ecstatic," which carries the sense of exalted feeling but also of excess, of mental disorder or alienation, of stepping out of and standing alongside the self. His description</page><page sequence="6">124 DIRK KLOPPER denotes an ambivalent kind of joy, an uneasy kind of thinking with the heart in a language that promises plenitude, seems to embody the totality of phenomena, to allow for a relationship of sympathetic identification and unification with the world, the real world in the fullness of its creation, the substantial world, but which has the insubstantiality, in fact, of a spell of some kind, a possession or psychic imaginary: "As soon, however, as this strange enchantment falls from me, I find myself confused; wherein this harmony transcending me and the entire world consisted, and how it made itself known to me, I could present in sensible words as little as I could say anything precise about the inner movements of my intestines or a congestion of my blood" (4). The transcendent "harmony" is an "enchantment" that cannot be presented in "sensible words," meaning words that are reasonable but also words that have the substance of sensory apprehension. There is a curious paradox here. A surfeit of sensory experience, a sensory overflow in which the most "casual object" presents itself with intense sensation (3), leads to spiritual apprehension of transcendental harmony, but this spiritual apprehension is not able to be represented in sensible words, in the language of the senses. At stake is the relationship between sensory experience and conceptual understanding, and the role of language in establishing this relation. Bacon's inductive method is intended to eliminate incertitude by establishing conceptual understanding on the basis of empirical observation, attaching words, as derivatives of concepts, to things. Chandos is not an anti- empiricist but a radical empiricist.7 He finds himself immersed in sensory apprehension, overwhelmed by sensation, invaded by things, unable to step back to form a stable connection between the thing and the verbal concept that would represent it. Instead, the thing connects with other things. Sensation does not lead to a sensible word but to a sensation of other things. The sensations connect with themselves rather than with words that might represent them. This state of being, where one thing leads to another is able to be represented only through a kind of endless displacement, an infinitude of associations, where the ground, the substance, the firm footing of realist representation falls away, dissolves, disintegrates, so that representation never fixes itself in a stable sign. This, at least, is Lady Chandos's experience of her husband's "affliction," an affliction that has now become her affliction. The term she uses to describe her experience is "rapture," to be seized and carried off, to be transported out of the boundaries of self. In this state of disassociation from a conventional self fixed by the stable reference points of language, "soul and body," she says "are one." When her husband "speaks" to her and</page><page sequence="7">LETTERS TO FRANCIS BACON 125 presses "into" her "what are no longer words but flaming swords," she is ready "to burst out in the tongues of angels" (Coetzee 228). Her purpose in writing to Francis Bacon is not, however, to celebrate these raptures but to seek refuge from them. "We are not made for revelation," she says, "where all is allegory," where we say "one thing always for another," and "words give way beneath [our] feet like rotting boards." In response to her husband's claim that during his epiphanies "even a negligible creature, a dog, a rat, a beetle" presses toward him "with such fullness, such presence of love," that everything has life and meaning, Lady Chandos, echoing his words, complains that we cannot live in such a state, where "each creature is key to all other creatures," where "rats and dogs and beetles" crawl through us "day and night," and "we interpenetrate and are interpenetrated" by "Presences of the Infinite" (228-29). Lady Chandos picks up on the vertiginous movement of a language no longer anchored in the stable world of realism, where sign and referent are fixed, and subject and object are clearly differentiated. Where there is neither stabilisation of signification nor clear articulation of the subject, it becomes difficult to distinguish between what is real and what is fantasy. It is as if the abandonment of realism as such, the language of realism, leads to loss of reality. In his letter, Chandos describes a loss of the ability to construct abstractions, and the abstraction he is most evidently incapable of constructing is reality itself. He is immersed, instead, in an undifferentiated real. Because nothing is more real than the real of the body, he likens his inability to represent his experience of the world to his inability to represent his bodily experience. He is, he says, as incapable of presenting his intimations of the harmony of all things in "sensible words" as he is of saying anything precise about "the inner movements of [his] intestines" or "a congestion of [his] blood." It is as if his mind, not the abstracting mind but the sensory imagination, compelled him, he says, to view all things "from an uncanny closeness" (Hofmannsthal 3). The closer he gets to phenomena the more they disintegrate, refusing to yield to the "simplifying eye of habit" and to be "encompassed by one idea" (3). That which is most uncannily close is the body, in its ecstasy, its falling apart. The integrity of the self is maintained by its distance from objects of consciousness. When this distance collapses, the self disintegrates in ecstatic dissolution and the body disaggregates into its various components.8 Chandos ends his letter by invoking a language beyond existing languages, a language whose words are unknown to him. This is the language in which things in themselves, inanimate things, speak to him, and wherein he says he may one day have to "justify" himself before "an</page><page sequence="8">126 DIRK KLOPPER unknown judge" (5). He is not talking about a language that abstracts the material world, not a language about the material world, but the language of the material world, what the material world itself signifies. While Chandos anticipates his having to justify himself in this language, it is Elizabeth Costello who is actually confronted with having to justify herself before an unknown judge in the final lesson of the novel, "At the Gate," where she similarly invokes the sublime of the thing itself, its otherness, its opacity. At first she resists having, as required, to state her belief, arguing that, as "secretary to the invisible" a writer suspends belief (Coetzee 199). Finally, however, she announces that she does, in fact, have a belief, a belief in the frogs of the mudflats of Dulgannon, that appear after rain and dig themselves deeply underground in the dry season, insignificant creatures, some as small as a finger nail, going through a life cycle of death and resurrection that may seem allegorical, "but to the frogs themselves," she says, "it is no allegory, it is the thing itself, the only thing" (217). To have a belief in something is not the same as speaking its language. Costello does not presume to speak the language of frogs. Her belief does not lie in language but in the real beyond language, in the thing itself, of which she cannot speak except in a displaced way, through allegory. The thing itself remains invisible, incapable of direct apprehension in words. Like Chandos, Costello accepts that her understanding is allegorical, but unlike Chandos, Costello, who is not given to ecstasy, does not claim access to a medium of thought "more immediate, more liquid, more glowing than words." She, too, is afflicted with an awareness of what Chandos calls "the monstrous fate" of creatures, such as the rat he imagines "baring its fangs" at the void, and beyond the void, at infinity (Hofmannsthal 4); she, too, is spoken to by creatures, addressed in a language she struggles to comprehend; she, too, seeks to "think with the heart." But the language she uses to perform this thinking is not an unknown language; it is the language of convention, the language of realism and of allegory, literary language.9 Lord Chandos resists the limits of language, seeks a place outside these limits, a place beyond the everyday context of relationship with others and world, a divine intimacy and sympathetic accord with things. Lady Chandos recoils from this uncanny closeness in favour of a more homely accommodation in the world where things are merely things rather than presences of the infinite, and where they can be identified as such by sensible words. Although Elizabeth Costello is ostensibly author of the Lady Chandos letter, and writes Lady Chandos into existence, there is no reason to assume that the persona of Lady Chandos represents her own views. Or if the persona does indeed represent her views, then Costello is using the</page><page sequence="9">LETTERS TO FRANCIS BACON 127 opportunity to offer a critical perspective on the views attributed to her in the narrative in which she has been written. In the narrative, Costello shares with Chandos the aspiration towards a language of the body, a language that connects us with things that are of the same substance as the body, brute material things, and, like Chandos, suggests that this language of the body is the closest we can get to a kind of divine language that connects us with all of creation. Unlike Chandos, however, she does not reject literary language in favour of wordless ecstasy. Her medium of communication is this language and her very being is a literary construct.10 The issue for her is how this language connects the human with the nonhuman, or, more accurately, the kind of relation literary language establishes between these different orders of being. It is in this context that she invokes Kafka's story "Report to an Academy" in the first lesson, when she raises the question of realism in her acceptance speech at Altona College on receiving the Stowe Award. Costello's son John is puzzled by her reference to Kafka, whose writing doesn't accord with his sense of realism, which has to do, he says, with "smelly underwear" and "people picking their noses" (Coetzee 32). She responds: No, Kafka didn't write about people picking their noses. But Kafka had time to wonder where and how his poor educated ape was going to find a mate. And what it was going to be like when he was left in the dark with the bewildered, half-tamed female that his keepers eventually produced for his use. Kafka's ape is embedded in life. It is the embeddedness that is important, not the life itself. His ape is embedded as we are embedded, you in me, I in you. That ape is followed through to the end, to the bitter, unsayable end, whether or not there are traces left on the page. Kafka stays awake during the gaps when we are sleeping. That is where Kafka fits in. (32) For John, the discussion with his mother concerns "the claims of realism versus the claims of idealism" (33). If the term "allegory" is substituted for the term "idealism," which is a more strictly literary rendering of the appropriate frame of reference, then the discussion can be seen to revolve around the relationship between realism and allegory. What puzzles John is precisely that his mother uses an allegorical text such as Kafka's "Report to the Academy" to speak about realism. Is the allegory being used to debunk realism or to underscore it?</page><page sequence="10">128 DIRK KLOPPER Costello appears to be trying to articulate a position beyond the binary opposition between realism and allegory. On the one hand, her commentary on Kafka's story illustrates the way in which the "word-mirror" of nineteenth-century realism has been shattered, resulting in a kind of endless allegorical displacement of meaning. About this she has no regrets, saying that the word-mirror kind of realism "looks to us like an illusion now, one of those illusions sustained only by the concentrated gaze of everyone in the room," which shatters as soon as the concentrated gaze is removed (19-20). In this understanding, realism is a function of habit, of conventional links between words and things, and these established meanings no longer have valency. On the other hand, however, as evident in her observation that "Kafka's ape is embedded in life," she seeks to recover a form of realism that has a different focus, a form of realism that concerns not life as much as embeddedness. "It is the embeddedness that is important, not the life itself," she says. In other words, the lesson to be learnt from realism concerns the relational dimension of experience, the attention given to the connections between things rather than the idea of the thing. Realism is not comfortable, says Costello, with ideas. For realism, she says, "ideas have no autonomous existence, can exist only in things" (9). She wishes to retain the materialist premise of realism, the embeddedness of ideas, and to dispense with the abstractions of idealism, which is why she has Kafka's allegory inhabited by realism. This is the obverse of her argument that realism is inhabited by allegory. In terms of the logic she seems to be exploring here, realism and allegory are not in an oppositional relationship but in a dialectical relationship. Each inhabits the other. There can be no choice, ultimately, between materialism and idealism, between experience and language, between sensation and thought. The multiplicity of being in the world, the endless displacement of being that characterise a consciousness fully open to experience, necessarily coheres around and is held in check by the idea of being, the differentiation and stabilisation of the relation between self and world.11 Traditionally, "allegory" denotes a form of narrative in which a literal meaning is accompanied by a figurative meaning. It derives from the Greek albs ('other') and agoreuein ('speak out'). The literal story carries with it another story, about something other than what is actually being said, which it manages to speak out through a series of linked metaphors. While each metaphor is singularly embedded in sense-experience, taken together, as elements of a larger narrative structure, the metaphors tend towards abstract conceptualisation. Allegory allows, then, for the coexistence of a heterogeneous materiality and an idealised meaning. It begins with sensory experience which is then enhanced to the point of vision.</page><page sequence="11">LETTERS TO FRANCIS BACON 129 It becomes possible now to see in what manner allegory enables sympathetic understanding between human and nonhuman, as indeed it does between human and human.12 Within the allegorical mode, different orders of being are accommodated within a syncretic whole. The heterogeneous materiality, the diverse forms of sensory and biological experience, the varied cultural contexts, the allusions, all these can be combined and interpreted in more than one way, can be read differently. The heterogeneous form is inherently ambiguous and polysémie. Kafka's allegory of the ape can mean many things. What is important is not what the story means, says Costello, but the embeddedness of the ape in life. We understand the ape because we, too, are embedded. This is not to say we understand its apeness, its otherness. What we understand, rather, is this embeddedness, the fact that, like us, the ape is embodied and has relations with life through the body. The relations we understand the ape to have are constituted by the act of reading, by the participation of the reader in the construction of these relations. When we consider allegory, we are dealing as much, then, with the question of reading as we are with the question of writing, the question of allegories of reading, of reading itself as allegory.13 Lord Chandos, alert to the point of conceptual confusion to the multiplicity of experience, where one thing leads always to another, finds himself in an allegorical world where there is no closure. Unlike Lord Chandos, the reader, having immersed himself in the rapturous experience of reading, comes to his senses and reflects on the significance of the experience in a somewhat more detached and sober mood. This move from experience to interpretation has an unavoidably reductive effect, tying the word to the thing, abstracting out of these multiple significations patterns of meaning governed by the conventions of the given discursive context, bringing closure. As Lady Chandos points out, we, the subjects of post-Renaissance modernity, are not made for revelation. We are unable to sustain revelation, to live permanently in a state of revelation, permanently outside of ourselves, endlessly displaced. We are no longer made for such anthropomorphic living, taking into ourselves the being of others and other orders of being. Precisely because we are no longer enchanted by the world we have power over it. Horkheimer and Adorno have shown how this abstracting power, this totalitarian domination, has led to a utilitarian administration of life in which the experiential capacity of the body has diminished (207). They attribute this contemporary paucity of being to the empirical thinking inaugurated by Francis Bacon. If Bacon is at fault, this lies in his belief that there exists the possibility of a language that is capable of capturing experience directly and regulating experience in a way that</page><page sequence="12">130 DIRKKLOPPER benefits human endeavour in the world. The postscript to Elizabeth Costello suggests that the solution does not lie in a re-enchantment of the world. This option is not available to us from our present historical location. What is available, though, is a re-imagining of the world from within the abstractions given to us by language, rather than from some place beyond language, for what lies beyond language is more language, the afterthought of language. We now know that there is an unavoidable limit to language, that language is characterised by the mechanism of the limit. Language differentiates and establishes relations between phenomena, and thus operates on the basis of a boundary. The boundary does not inhere in phenomena themselves. It is not a natural boundary but a conventional boundary, a boundary established by convention, which is why boundaries can change and phenomena can present themselves differently. Elizabeth Costello enjoins us to consider what we have made of language and what it has made of us. At a pedagogical level, it asks us to think about how our access to language positions us in relation to other beings, to reflect on the hierarchies of beings we have created in language and sustain through language, and to contemplate what it would require from language to renegotiate these relations. At a performative level, it stages the limits of language by drawing attention to its fictional status, by having its protagonist step outside the narrative to respond to her construction by the narrative, and by providing a postscript that itself destabilises reference in responding to the modernist crisis of language. Elizabeth Costello demonstrates that we have only language by means of which to engage with the question of language. There is no stepping outside language to transcend its limits. Any determination in language requires a subjection to the limits of language. At best we can step outside a particular discursive formation (the narrative) into another discursive formation (the postscript), thereby redrawing the boundary and creating another determination. This finitude, this occupation of a horizon of determination, is paradoxically the very condition of infinitude, of an endless constitution and reconstitution of the experience of being in the world, an experience that contains the possibility of realism and allegory, fixity and displacement, familiarity and otherness, self-possession and self-transcendence.

Wordsworth does not so much reject empiricism as engage with it, assimilating its sensationalist premise even as he drives this premise to a different conclusion, seeing the life of the senses as the basis of spiritual vision, for example in "Tintern Abbey." In To the Lighthouse, Woolf likewise takes as point of departure the sensational basis of consciousness, portraying consciousness as a texture of endlessly reconstructed experience based on memory traces. 7. Radical empiricism leads paradoxically to dissociation from the world as there is no guarantee that sensation in fact conforms with what lies out there. 8. My argument here draws on Jacques Lacan's distinctions between the Real, the Imaginary and the Symbolic in "The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis." 9. Gareth Cornwell has written incisively on realism and on allegory in relation to Coetzee. However, he treats them as separate concerns whereas I've tried here to treat them as interrelated concerns.

While this observation is compelling, it does suggest that a kind of ecstatic movement outside the self is necessary, and that loss of self is therefore the price to pay for the sympathetic imagination. I am trying to find a way here of arriving at an understanding of the operation of the sympathetic imagination that does not require a psychotic breakdown, such as Lord Chandos experiences, but allows for a stepping outside the self while retaining the self as necessary point of reference or anchor, resulting not in a collapse of phenomena into one another but a relation between them.</page><page sequence="14">132 DIRK KLOPPER 13. Derek Attridge has written eloquently about allegories of writing and reading in "Against Allegory: Waiting for the Barbarians and Life &amp; Times of Michael K" In his understanding, allegory approximates to ideology, where the novel is made to conform to a pre-existing structure of meaning. By contrast, I am concerned specifically with the indeterminacy of allegory. Nevertheless, Attridge's observations on the literal and the allegorical intersect in interesting ways with the problematic I am exploring here around realism and allegory, especially his emphasis on the event of reading, the experience of the text.
