Plant to thank for doing an extensive analysis of Zora Neale Hurston's unpublished manuscript, Herod the Great, a novel that would have depicted the life and times of a man who supposedly ordered the deaths of many children in an effort to kill the Christ-child, as the Gospel of Matthew records.1 Plant's fortitude in taking Hurston's Herod seriously is remarkable, especially given the critical pronounce- ments of prominent scholars. As Robert E. Hemenway claims, Herod indicates that late Hurston (1949-1960) was "a talent in ruins/' because the "manuscript suffers from poor characterization, pedantic scholarship, and inconsistent style" (345). Carla Kaplan not only accepts Hemenway' s assessment, but also extends his critique to the letters about the projected work: "It is hard to imagine how Hurston could not have known there were problems with the Herod book. Even her letters about it seem dull compared to others" (Hurston, Letters 602). To counter such uncharitable judgments, Plant skillfully illustrates how Hurston's Herod is an extension and amplification of ideas found in her earlier works, specifically Moses, Man of the Mountain. If Hurston's Moses challenges the Old Testament version of the ancient Hebrew leader by suggesting that Moses was actually an Egyptian, Hurston's Herod challenges the New Testament version of the baby-murdering tyrant by suggesting that he was actually a forerunner of Christ. Therefore, according to Plant, Moses and Herod are great works because they intelligently and honestly portray the ideal human - "Herod, like Moses, was representative of Hurston's ideal individual" (Zora 138) - and convincingly challenge accepted versions of history: "Hurston was audacious in her heroic conception of King Herod. She certainly had to be self-reliant given the seemingly universal condemnation of this man. Original in thought, she had to be bold in spirit as she created a work that defied history" (Zora 142). In essence, Plant exposes the faulty assumptions that allowed Hemenway and Kaplan to dismiss Hurston's late work. Quoting a fragment of an undated letter, Plant rightly dem- onstrates that, rather than trying to appeal to a sympathetic audience, Hurston ultimately desired "to add to the store of human knowledge and permanent literature" (Plant, Zora 140; Kaplan 838), a situation that oftentimes placed her at odds with editors and readers. Therefore, instead of judging the work on the basis of its appeal to the readers and edi- tors of Hurston's day, Plant urges us to determine the value of Herod on the basis of its contribution to the history of ideas and the evolution of aesthetics. Publishing one of the introductions to Hurston's Herod, I contend, will not only dem- onstrate that Plant's valuation of Hurston's late work is in large measure right, but it will also enable us to make sense of some of Hurston's earlier work. The Herod manuscript was Callaloo 34.1 (2011) 101-120</page><page sequence="3">CALLALOO never completed, and what we have of it has suffered both water and fire damage, espe- cially the last thirty pages. Undamaged, however, are four introductions, and the version I have selected for publication is a combination of Introduction С and Introduction D.2 It was Hurston's objectives regarding Herod as articulated most clearly in her letters about the work that have guided my selection. There are four main reasons why Hurston wanted to write a book about Herod. First, she believes that the New Testament representation (Matthew 2:1-23) was a horrid distortion. By presenting Herod "against the back-drop of his time and customs" (Introduction С 1), Hurston holds that she can give readers "the real, the historical Herod, instead of the deliberately folklore Herod" (Preface В 1) of the Bible. Second, Hurston argues that an accurate depiction of Herod would ultimately expose the dominant view of Christianity, which claims that Jesus Christ is God, as both historically false and politically dangerous. Third, Hurston asserts that an accurate representation of Herod and his age would render the anti-Semitism of the twentieth century, specifically as Hitler and the Nazis conceive it, incoherent. Finally, Hurston contends that the story of Herod and his times would shed considerable light on the dominant model of racism in the twentieth-century West.3 Before turning to the introductions, let me briefly discuss two recent scholarly devel- opments that now make it possible for us to really understand and appreciate Hurston's work on Herod. Starting in the nineteenth century, it was assumed that secularization was underway in the West. Ludwig Feuerbach' s analysis of anthropomorphism, Max Weber's depiction of the disenchantment of the world, Sigmund Freud's characterization of re- ligion as an illusion /delusion, Benedict Anderson's description of the emerging secular nation-state, Steve Bruce' s representation of relativism as the modern age's dominant cognitive style - all of these theories seemingly indicated that secularization was an ir- reversible inevitability.4 Recent scholars have started not only to expose the limitations of secularization theory, as do Vincent P. Pecora, Tracy Fessenden, Michael Allen Gillespie, and Pericles Lewis, but also to question its legitimacy altogether, for as Callum G. Brown claims, "Secularisation theory is now a narrative in crisis" (30), a view shared by William E. Connolly, who asserts: "The historical modus vivendi called secularism is coming apart at the seams" (19).5 That Hurston understood as early as the 1940s what scholars are only starting to ac- cept in recent years is clear when she claims in 1942 that "two thousand years have gone by and all the Western World uses the sign of the Cross" (Dust 246) to justify its intrusive and invasive political agenda. It is because the twentieth-century West is Christian, and em- phatically not secular, that Hurston considers the Herod story of such importance. As she claims in Preface B, a study of the life of Herod is important "[f]or many valid reasons, the first being that the West, whose every nation, professes Christianity" (1), is the logical product of events that took place in Herod's day. She makes this point directly in a letter to the editor, Burroughs Mitchell: "the LIFE OF HEROD THE GREAT is not really the story of a man, but of a movement which has ended up in Christianity on one hand, and as the basis of Western civilization on the other" (Letters 665). What, in part, has accounted for the radical reassessment of secularization is the burgeon- ing body of scholarship about Hitler and the Nazis. As early as 1938, with the publication of Erich Voegelin's Political Religions, scholars interpreted National Socialism in terms of secularization. To put this in Voegelin's words: "the secularisation of life, which the con- 102</page><page sequence="4">CALLALOO cept of humanism brought with it, is precisely the soil in which anti-Christian religious movements such as National Socialism could grow" (3). This secularization approach led prominent scholars to characterize the National Socialist attack on the Jews as either irre- ligious or anti-Christian. For instance, in Dialectic of Enlightenment, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, when discussing the Nazis' attack on Jews, claim that "[t]he nationalist brand of anti-Semitism ignores religious considerations/' because "[t]he nationalists real- ize that men have long since ceased to bother about their eternal salvation" (176). In The Origins of Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt aggressively pursues a secular interpretation of the rise of fascism in Germany, arguing that the anti-Semitism of Hitler and the Nazis is based on "a secular nineteenth-century ideology" that is distinct from traditional "religious Jew-hatred" (xi).6 Thus, Doris L. Bergen was right in 1996 to claim that scholars almost invariably "present Nazism as a thoroughly secular phenomenon" (9). Starting in the 1990s, however, there was a massive shift in Holocaust scholarship, which has posed a serious challenge to the secularization hypothesis. In Twisted Cross, Bergen clearly documents the degree to which an overwhelming number of German Christians considered their faith to be consistent with National Socialism and thus explains why so many Christians supported Hitler and the Nazis. In Constantinos Sword, James Carroll draws a clear line of connection between Christian theology and the Nazi pogroms against Jews, though he stops short of concluding that Hitler and / or the Nazis were Christian. But in the dauntingly well-researched book The Holy Reich, Richard Steigmann-Gall convinc- ingly demonstrates that Hitler and many Nazis believed that "Christianity is at the center of Nazi social thought" (46), and, thus, played a crucial role in setting the stage for the Final Solution.7 Most recently, Kevin P. Spicer takes a close look at the numerous Catho- lic priests who actively supported the Nazis in Hitler's Priests, while Susannah Heschel examines the degree to which many in Germany treated "Nazism as the very fulfillment of Christianity" (17) in The Aryan Jesus. As I intend to argue in the rest of this essay, what motivated Hurston to write Herod the Great was her conviction that the West, including Nazi Germany, had adopted a specific version of Christianity that not only justified but also necessitated the negation of Judaism and the Jew.8 Hemenway (343) and Plant (Zora 134), when discussing the Herod manuscript, certainly discuss Hurston' s unambiguous denunciation of anti-Semitism, but they do not examine the degree to which Hurston understood modern anti-Semitism as primarily based on Christianity. The reason why, one suspects, has something to do with a certain sensitivity to American readers, who tend to be Christian, and this is precisely one of the reasons why Hurston feared the publication of " Tnrod. As she claims in a letter to Max Eastman, if her interpretation of Herod and the First ^ ~^ ВСЕ are right, then her novel would undermine Christ's uniqueness, underscore Christ ^ _, :^hness, and ultimately be "de- structive of the divinity of Christ" (Letters 737). Given that r r novel would be published in the Christian West, it should come as no surprise that she .sked Eastman: "Now, would you dare to do the book if you were in my place?" (Letters 737). It is perhaps the contro- versial content that led editors such as Mitchell (Scribner's) and David McKay (Harper Brothers) to reject Herod.9 It was in the early 1940s that Hurston started to question the logic of the Herod story (as articulated in Matthew 2) as well as to suggest that the anti-Semitism of Hitler and the Nazis had its origins in a specific interpretation of Christ. While Hurston does not discuss 103</page><page sequence="5">CALLALOO Hitler in any of the introductions to the Herod manuscript, she does mention him in a lengthy passage from a bowdlerized chapter ("Seeing the World as It Is") of Dust Tracks on a Road (1942), that first suggests her interest in and concern with the Herod story, and in a letter to Carl Van Vechten, where she indicates for the first time her intention to write a book about Herod. For instance, in the bowdlerized chapter from Dust Tracks, Hurston notes some gaps and inconsistencies in the Herod story of the Bible.10 But instead of working through the logic of those gaps and inconsistencies, Hurston turns her attention to Christians, who, she claims, have "slaughtered] more innocents in one night than" Herod's "soldiers ever saw" (245). At this point, she specifically has Jewish victims in mind, for as she claims in the next sentence: "Those Jews who would not accept Christianity look very bad in the New Testament" (245-46). But this model of persecution, she continues, was not merely a thing of the past, for she then claims that "two thousand years have gone by and all the Western World [still] uses the sign of the Cross" (246) to enact its political agenda. After setting up this model, Hurston shifts her focus to the Germans, and specifically "Hitler's crime" (251). Reading this chapter, it is difficult to understand how Hurston can go from Herod to Christian anti-Semitism to Hitler. But Hurston's letters about and introductions to Herod clarify her logic. After the Crucifixion, a number of people claimed that Christ's birth signified a com- plete rupture with Jews and Judaism. As Hurston says in a letter to William Bradford Huie: "It is ironical that immediately upon the death of Christ, His so-called followers, not understanding Him, went back to the primitive fears and demonology, and looked upon Herod as an enemy of religion, and concocted a bogeyman of him" (Letters 710). The most egregious example of this process of demonization can be found in Matthew 2, where Herod is portrayed as a baby-murdering tyrant. No doubt, Hurston considers the New Testament representation of Herod to be a flagrant distortion. That Hurston considered the Bible to be a profoundly flawed document is not difficult to illustrate. For example, in the bowdlerized chapter, Hurston explains how the ancient Hebrews of the Old Testament effectively demonized the Canaanites in order to justify getting rid of them (Dust Tracks 245). But her portrayal of this demonizing process in the Old Testament is merely a prelude to her discussion of the New Testament's subtler techniques: "The New Testament is not quite so frank [as the Old Testament], but it is equally biased. Paul and the disciples set up a New Order in Palestine after the death of Jesus, but the Jews gave it nothing but their shoulder-blades. So now the Orthodox Jew became a manifest enemy of right" (Dust Tracks 245). On the surface, Hurston's motivation for debunking the New Testament is to expose the representation of Herod as flawed and even false, for as she claims in a letter by quoting an unspecified source: "scholars state that there is no historical basis for the legend of the slaughter of the innocents by Herod" (Letters 729). Indeed, given surviving documents about Herod, Hurston insists that "there is NO historical background for the story in Mat- thew 2, that Herod butchered those children" (Letters 737). Hurston draws this conclusion because Herod, while a Roman, adopted an Essene-based religious philosophy, which would have precluded such barbarous action: "So the doctrine of brotherly love, God the father of all mankind equally, and not just the Jews, gained ground in his [Herod's] reign" (Letters 733). In essence, the picture of Herod in Matthew 2 is in irreconcilable conflict with what we know about Herod's personal character, religious orientation, and political philosophy. 104</page><page sequence="6">CALLALOO If Hurston' s characterization of Herod sounds similar to certain versions of Christ, this is no mistake. Hurston actually considers Jesus to be the logical product of the Essenes' religious philosophy, and this is the real scandal at the core of Hurston's work on Christian and political history. Indeed, "Herod the Great," Hurston claims in a letter to Mitchell, "had a great influence in preparing the way for Him [Christ]" (Letters 703). In a 1955 letter, she claims that "Herod lent his aid to the movement out of which Christianity evolved/' Therefore, Hurston concludes: "When you review the tenets of the Essenes, that third philosophical sect in Palestine, you will find that everything Christ did or said, according to the Four Gospels was straight from it. Other things tend to confirm that both Jesus Christ and John the Baptist were Essenes" [Letters 732-33). This is something that traditional Chris- tianity could not admit or acknowledge. The traditional view holds that Christ emerged sui generis and, therefore, His being marks a decisive rupture with all previous cultural, religious, and philosophical traditions. But for Hurston, the exact opposite was the case: A "New concept of God and His relationship to man which had been working like a yeast in Palestine for 300 years [was] emerging, formulated at last as what is now known as Christianity. It was a movement totally within the Jewish people NOT A SUDDEN AND MIRACULOUS HAPPENING AS IS TOLD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT" (Letters 737). What really motivated Hurston to reject the sui generis Christ, and this is her primary motivation for debunking the New Testament, is that the Christian conception of divinity institutes a type of representation that leads necessarily and inevitably to a racist-based politics, a Christian politics that reached its apex in the twentieth century. We see this form of representation most clearly in the way Christians characterize the Jews, according to Hurston. To make Christ and Christianity totally original, completely separate from Jews and Judaism, early Christians had to essentialize the Jews. Instead of noting the radical differences between Sadducees, Pharisees, and Essenes, early Christians lumped them all together as the Jews. In the introductions to Herod, Hurston differentiates the various Jewish sects of the day. Here is her depiction in Introduction A: Three Jewish philosophical sects - Pharisees, Sadducees and Essenes were all in flourishing existence for at least two centuries before Herod was born. They came into being through the impact of Greek thought on Judea. Flavius Josephus, himself a Pharisee, the Pharisees were "kin" to the Stoics; the Sadducees were of the persuasion of the Greek pragmatists. These Sadducees, unlike the Pharisees and Essenes, denied that there was such a thing as arbitrary fate, but insisted that things came about through cause and effect. Therefore, men by their own attitudes and actions, controlled their own fate. Though Persian religious concepts influenced Jewish thought con- siderably during those seventy years, the Sadducees utterly rejected the Persian concept of life after death. (5) Of the three sects, the Essenes were the ones to have the most decisive influence on Christ and Christianity. To quote Hurston: "Sublimated through Jewish monotheism, the contract- minded and avenging Jehovah emerges as the loving, understanding, tender Father of the Essenes and later, Christianity" (Introduction A 5). Given the logic of Hurston's portrayal of the period, the sui generis argument about Christ only works if Christians totally reject the major influence the Jewish sect of the Essenes (and specifically Herod) had in deter- 105</page><page sequence="7">CALLALOO mining Christ's character and theology. But demonizing Herod, the Essenes, and the Jews is precisely what early Christians did. The way early Christians were able to distance Christ and Christianity from the primary force that brought both into being was to subsume the various religious sects of the time under the single rubric of the Jews. In a passage that Hurston struggled in the various introductions to get exactly right, she says: That brings up the observation of the strange and hard-to-explain attitude of the Christian world towards Jewish cultural develop- ment. It seems to be determined to make the Jews, "God's peculiar treasure," untruthfully and unnecessarily peculiar by omission. Nowhere in our Sunday School literature are the Jews presented as bound by the same natural laws of evolution of social progress as compels others. No, just as the rude tribesmen appeared at Sinai receiving the Law, so Christian children are left to conceive of them in the First Century ВС and even at the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in 70 AD. Not like a growing, changing living entity, but like a pressed flower between the leaves of the Bible. One has only to look at the Jews in one's own community to see that this is not, nor could ever have been true. (Introduction D 6) The Christian representation of the Jews ignores the "natural laws of evolution of social progress that compels others." Therefore, instead of acknowledging many different Jewish sects and traditions, early Christians claimed that there are only the Jews, and instead of acknowledging that Jews evolve from one age to the next, Christians represented them as eternally the same, crushed "like a pressed flower between the leaves of the Bible."11 To underscore the absurdity of the Christian propensity to use the biblical representa- tion of the Jews from the Sinai Theophany to understand contemporary Jews, Hurston asks her reader to reflect on the way present-day Nordics are represented: "Nobody now would assume that the present-day progressive Nordic was identical with his ancestors" (Introduction D 6). To understand the nature of Hurston's critique, it is important to note that she identifies three separate modes of representation in her work on Herod. First, there is the anthro- pological way, which represents people on the basis of the "natural laws of evolution." According to this system, ethnic groups evolve over the ages, so what a people was in one age will differ considerably in the next. Moreover, with the introduction of compet- ing ideas, ethnic groups will fragment, thus leading to schisms and factions such as the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes. Second, there is the biblical way of representing the anti-Christian (the Jew), which incarcerates people within an archetype. This form of representation takes something that is living (a people) and crushes it between the Bible's pages, thereby preserving the static image for future generations but only by prohibiting the evolution, growth, and change of the people represented. According to this logic, if the Jews are of their father, who is the devil, as Christ claims in the Gospel of John (8:44), then that is what they will be for all eternity. Also, it refuses to acknowledge differences and contradictions among various groups of people. Given the nature of this model, it would seem that only non-Christians are incarcer- ated within the biblical text, for when Hurston refers to "the present-day progressive 106</page><page sequence="8">CALLALOO Nordic[s]/r whom Hurston considers to be typically Christian, she implies that they grow and evolve. But there is a third mode of representation, another biblical form, which ap- plies only to Christians. This is the sui generis version of representation, which holds that Christ and his followers transcend the "natural laws of evolution/' According to the logic of this model, Christ was not the logical product of his age. It is not possible to identify or define the cultural, political, or intellectual forces that brought Christ into being, for his divine origin transcends the mundane causality implicit in the "natural laws of evolution." Therefore, Christ was "A SUDDEN AND MIRACULOUS HAPPENING," which had no antecedent causes. In like manner, Christians, who become Christian only insofar as they are born again in Christ, differ from Jews because they have the capacity to transcend the natural laws of evolution. So while Jews are incarcerated within a biblical image that prohibits growth and change, Christians are incarcerated within a biblical image of sui generis transcendence. As such, anti-Christians (Jews) defy the natural laws of evolution by never changing or growing, while Christians defy the natural laws of evolution by transcending them altogether. As an anthropologist, Hurston not only favored the form of representation that is pre- mised on the natural laws of evolution, but she also rejected the model of representation that trapped anti-Christians (Jews) in a biblical image of deadly stasis as well as Christians in a biblical image oí sui generis transcendence. Her motivation for this rejection was not just that the biblical form of representation is incoherent and obsolete. Rather, it was that the biblical model is politically destructive. Indeed, Hurston believed that the biblical model produced the racist political agenda of the dominant nations in the twentieth-century West, which explains why National Socialists came to power. That Hurston specifically had Hitler in mind when she thought of twentieth-century biblical representation is clear from the first letter she wrote about the Herod manuscript. Written to Van Vechten in 1945, Hurston faults "the Christian world," which "reads the Bible with their [sic] prejudices, and not with their eyes" (Letters 529). This, she argues, is most clearly illustrated through the representation of the Jews. Rejecting the traditional view which holds that Jews are people who blindly accepted Moses' "new religion," Hurston suggests that many Jews rebelled against Moses, an argument that she makes in a number of the introductions to Herod.12 Unfortunately, she continues, the stories of the rebel Jews were never heard, not simply because of the dictatorial tyranny of Moses and his disciples - "Arbitrarily, he [Moses] places his stooge, Aaron, his family and tribe over the people forever" (Letters 530) - but also because of the totalitarian hegemony of Christianity. She makes this point about contemporary Christianity numerous times in the letter, but the most significant references echo the claims she makes in the Herod introductions. For instance, after referencing the horrible suffering the Jews experienced, Hurston specifies the present situation. She criticizes what contemporary Gentiles are being "taught in Sunday Schools," for those lessons function to justify "our present-day prejudices" against Jews, but she also confesses that, like many Christians of her day, she had been "taught of the evil ways of the Jews." Indeed, "[s]o evil" were the Jews, according to those lessons, "that God just had to do away with them. They are meant to be kicked around" (Letters 532). This personal experience in the Sunday School Hurston considers more than just an isolated event. It reflects a mass movement among contemporary Christians to demonize Jews and to justify their suffering, which is why she claims in the bowdlerized chapter 107</page><page sequence="9">CALLALOO that "[t]o this day, the names of Pharisee and Sadducee are synonymous with hypocrite and crook to ninety-nine and a half percent of the Christian world" (Dust Tracks 245). After explaining to Van Vechten what she hopes to accomplish in her new book, to demonstrate that many post-Moses and pre-Christ Jews, the very Jews who paved the way for Christ, were "fighting for all those things which other people hold sacred and conducing to the rights and dignity of man" (Letters 530), she notes the irony of the contemporary Christian representation of the Jews: We gloat over our own Reformation and freedom from the domination of the Catholic Church when it had and exercised temporal power, yet our Sunday School lessons teach us to regard the same instincts in the Jews as evil, thus justifying any evil &amp; suffering that they have had and further that any imposed upon them at present or in the future as being what they have coming to them for "disobedience to God." (Letters 530-31) By doing a project of massive historical excavation, Hurston hopes to set "forth the suf- ferings of the muted people" (531). But this leads her to draw a clear line of connection between the sufferings of post-Moses-and-pre-Christ Jews and twentieth-century Jews: "Was there ever a more helpless or pathetic picture of terror and death before Hitler?" (531), she queries. In essence, Hurston establishes parallels that explain not just why so many post-Moses-and-pre-Christ Jews suffered, but also why so many contemporary Jews "at present or in the future" suffer. Drawing this line of connection, she suggests, would function as an explicit indictment of contemporary Christianity, for it "is a terrible picture and equal to what has gone on in our Christian lands under the Popes &amp; Preachers" (531). In the bowdlerized chapter from Dust Tracks, she specifically claims that "two thousand years have gone by and all the Western World [still] uses the sign of the Cross" (246) to justify its horrid treatment of the Jews. Just so that there is no confusion about the perpe- trators she has in mind, Hurston, writing in 1941, specifies the Germans: "The Germans have now conquered the French and the French wonder how those Germans can be so lacking in soul. But the Germans open their blue eyes in amazement. Why, nothing could be more reasonable and just" (247). It should come as no surprise that Hurston mentions "Hitler's crime" (Dust Tracks 251) only a few pages later. Is the link that Hurston establishes between the New Testament representation of Herod and "Hitler's crime" justified? This is the question that I intend to answer in the remain- ing pages of this essay. In recent years, scholars have been increasingly demonstrating that Hitler and the Nazis considered themselves and their movement to be Christian, but there has been a failure to define the precise nature of their version of Christianity. As I will demonstrate, it was Immanuel Kant who provided Hitler and the Nazis with their distinctive version of Christianity, which I refer to as Christian idealism. That Kant ex- erted considerable influence on the Nazis is clear from Adolf Eichmann's remarks during a police examination before his 1961 trial in Jerusalem. Eichmann "declared with great emphasis that he had lived his whole life according to Kant's moral precepts, and espe- cially according to a Kantian definition of duty" (Arendt, Eichmann 135-36). 13 Eichmann was no anomaly, for as Alfred Rosenberg, editor of the official Nazi newspaper Völkischer Beobachter and a prominent ideological and political leader within the Nazi Party, claims: 108</page><page sequence="10">CALLALOO "Kanťs words" about "the starry heavens above us and the moral law within us" (an allusion to the conclusion of Critique of Practical Reason) are so popular among Germans that they are in danger of being "reduced to triviality" (197). It is Kanťs extensive influ- ence on the Nazis that has led Charles W. Mills to conclude: "the embarrassing fact for the white West (which doubtless explains its concealment) is that their most important moral theorist [Kant] of the past three hundred years is also the foundational theorist in the modern period of the division between Herrenvolk and Untermenschen, persons and subpersons, upon which Nazi theory would later draw" (72). 14 That Kant would be considered one of the primary influences on National Socialism should come as no surprise, for the ideological architects of Nazi ideology (Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Dietrich Eckart, and Rosenberg) explicitly credit Kant with formulating a coherent Christian theology that could be used as the basis and foundation for National Socialism, and it is this Christian theology that has specifically inflected the writings of Hitler and many prominent Nazis as well as the Party Program. Let me briefly define the nature of that theology. According to Kant, the physical universe is governed by the mechanistic laws of natural necessity, which are temporally conditioned and spatially limited. Thus, determinism rules the day. The only way to rise above determinism is to behave as an autonomous moral agent, something a person achieves either by resisting the pleasures of the flesh or by transcending environmental conditioning. Put simply, freedom is the marker of being a morally autonomous agent, and by freedom, Kant means the ability to determine the environment rather than being determined by it. Within Kanťs framework, for a faith to qualify as a "true religion" (Religion 79), it must be based on a universal moral law, which inspires believers to experience freedom. This approach to religion had devastating consequences for Judaism and Jews. According to Kant, "of all the public religions which have ever existed, the Christian alone is moral" (Religion 47), and this is the case, because Christianity consists "not in dogmas and rites but in the heart's disposition to fulfill all human duties as divine commands" (Religion 79). Kant defines Christianity most clearly by contrasting it with Judaism, which never rises to the level of a religion, because it is steeped in the sensuous (that which is empirically determined by the mechanistic laws of natural necessity) rather than the intelligible (that which transcends the mechanistic laws of natural necessity) world: The Jewish faith was, in its original form, a collection of mere statu- tory laws upon which was established a political organization; for whatever moral additions were then or later appended to it in no way whatever belong to Judaism as such. Judaism is really not a religion at all but merely a union of a number of people who, since they belonged to a particular stock, formed themselves into a com- monwealth under purely political laws, and not into a church; nay, it was intended to be merely an earthly state so that, were it possibly to be dismembered through adverse circumstances, there would still remain to it (as part of its very essence) the political faith in its reestablishment (with the advent of the Messiah) (Religion 116). For Kant, nothing in Judaism inspires believers to behave as autonomous moral agents, because the faith is based on the Ten Commandments ("statutory laws"), which ultimately 109</page><page sequence="11">CALLALOO lead to "mechanical worship" (Religion 118), a blind obedience to a pre-given Law. In es- sence, Kant is saying that Judaism is a purely materialistic faith (hence, not a religion), because it is based on a principle of mechanical obedience rather than an autonomous moral and /or intellectual faculty. This explains why Christianity should be understood as "completely forsaking the Judaism from which it sprang" (Religion 118). Chamberlain, who wrote a 900-page book on Kant, published The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century in 1899, a work that was hailed "as the 'gospel of the Nazi move- ment'" according to William Shirer (159). Shirer notes that Chamberlain was extolled as "the 'spiritual founder' of National Socialist Germany" (158), and on September 5, 1925, "the Nazi Völkischer Beobachter'' celebrated Chamberlain's seventieth birthday "with five columns of encomiums" (159). As for the publication and distribution of Foundations, it "sold more than a quarter of a million copies" (156) by 1938. Given Chamberlain's com- prehensive vision of religion, politics, and Germany, Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century (note the allusion in the title to Chamberlain's Foundations), "hailed him as a pioneer and spiritual forerunner and viewed himself as Chamberlain's true successor" (Field 1). In 1923, Joseph Goebbels read The Foundations, and when he met Chamberlain in 1926, he indicates in his diary how important Chamberlain was to National Socialism by referring to him as a "spiritual father," dubbing him a "Trail blazer, pioneer!" (83). It should, therefore, come as no surprise that Roderick Stackelberg, author of a major study about the influence of idealism on the Nazis, argues that "The Foundations prophetically anticipated the coming of the Third Reich" (131). More significant, however, are the interactions between Chamberlain and Hitler. Geof- frey Field notes that Hitler "read the Foundations, Chamberlain's biography of Wagner, and some of the war pamphlets" (452). But more important for Hitler's stature as well as his sense of himself was Chamberlain's public endorsement. After only a couple meet- ings, Chamberlain, who "had never before aligned himself so wholeheartedly with any political figure" (Field 436), told Hitler in a letter: "you have transformed the state of my soul" (Field 437). Not only did his letter bolster the Nazi party, for when "Chamberlain became the first person of national and even international reputation as a writer to align himself with the Nazi movement" (Field 438), it affirmed Hitler's sense of himself as the destined leader of Germany. Indeed, after receiving word of the letter, members at the Nazi Party headquarters in Munich were euphoric, and Hitler was so giddy that he was supposedly "like a child" (Field 438). The most significant links between Chamberlain and Hitler relate to their theology. Ac- cording to Chamberlain, Jesus' s divinity as well as his message are only comprehensible through the lens of Kant's moral philosophy.15 Teutonic Christians are not at the mercy of selfish inclination, the mechanistic universe, or the historical past. They can transcend the world of sense (empirical world) and inhabit the intelligible world, something that is possible because "freedom is the intellectual basis of the whole Germanic nature" (Cham- berlain 1.547). It is this capacity for freedom that distinguishes humans from animals, for as Chamberlain claims, a being becomes more than animal when "he discovers in himself what Kant calls 'the spontaneity of freedom/ something utterly unmechanical and anti- mechanical" (11.480). By stark contrast, the Jew lacks freedom, because he is solely gov- erned by materialism: "Wherever the Semitic spirit has breathed, we shall meet with this materialism" (1.422). This explains why Judaism is "the most materialistic - yes, assuredly 110</page><page sequence="12">CALLALOO the most materialistic - religion in the world" (1.234) and why "the revelation of Christ has no significance for the Jew!" (1.336). Instead of seeing God as an apolitical being that transcends material concerns, Chamberlain argues that "[t]he relation of the Jews to their God is from the first political" (1.232), a view that leads Chamberlain to pose the following question: "how then was it possible to let our judgment be so befogged as to consider the Jews a religious people?" (1.217). If religion is based on idealism, and Christ incarnates idealism, then Christ and Christianity would implicitly negate Judaism: "Whoever wishes to see the revelation of Christ must passionately tear this darkest of veil from his eyes. His advent is not the perfecting of the Jewish religion but its negation" (1.221). 16 When Hitler refers to himself and National Socialism as Christian, it is as a Christian idealist. That Hitler claimed that the Nazi party is based on Christianity is simply a mat- ter of historical fact. As he says in one of his first speeches after coming to power: "it is Christians and not international atheists who now stand at the head of Germany" (My New Order 148; 15 Feb. 1933). In a 1934 speech, Hitler specified the nature of the Nazi Party's Christian orientation by claiming that " [t]he National Socialist State professes its allegiance to positive Christianity" (Speeches 385; 17 Aug. 1934). Given its commitment to positive Christianity, Hitler claims that the Nazi Party "stands on the ground of a real Christian- ity," because it is based on "Christian principles" (Speeches 386, 387; 26 Aug. 1934). Even as late as 1945, Hitler insists that "God the Almighty has made our nation. By defending its existence we are defending His work" ("Text" 4). Central to Hitler's Christian conception of the political is the view that Christ embodies idealism. Like Kant and Chamberlain, Hitler claims that the "Jew cannot possess a religious institution" because "he lacks idealism in any form" (Mein 306). Indeed, in Mein Kampf, Hitler claims that idealism "alone created the concept of man" (299), and since Jews lack "the idealistic attitude" (301), they are either the lowest form of human on the great chain of being or they do not qualify as humans in the strict sense of the word. Based on this lack of idealism, Hitler argues that Jews cannot create first a religion and second a state, and the ordering here is important. Without religious idealism, a people could experience state-like formations coming into being, but that people could not create a lasting state. So when Hitler claims that "the Jews are members of a people and not of a 'religion'" (Mein 306), an assertion that bears a striking resemblance to Kant's proclamation that "Judaism is really not a religion at all but merely a union of a number of people," he is also imply- ing that they cannot form a lasting state, because they lack the capacity for freedom, the prerequisite for forming a legitimate polity. According to the logic of this model, so long as materialist Jews are present, Christian idealism cannot come to fruition, and since a lasting and legitimate nation-state can only come into being if it is based on Christian idealism, this means that tolerating the presence of the Jew would undermine the very formation and foundation of the state. Therefore, true Christianity, which is the only legitimate basis for the body politic, entails the negation of the materialist Jew. As Hitler concludes in Mein Kampf: the Jew's "life is only of this world," and, therefore, "alien to true Christianity" (307). Given Hitler's view of Christian idealism, it should come as no surprise that he believes that he must wage a war against the materialistic Jew: "by defending myself against the ]ew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord" (Mein 65). Understanding the distinctive nature of Christianity that Hitler and the Nazis ad- opted sheds considerable light on point 24 of the National Socialist Party Program, part 111</page><page sequence="13">CALLALOO of which reads: "The party as such represents the standpoint of a positive Christianity, without tying itself to a particular confession. It fights the spirit of Jewish materialism within us and without us" (qtd. in Steigmann-Gall 14). When the author of point 24 claims that the Nazis, who explicitly say that they subscribe to positive Christianity, must fight against the "Jewish materialistic spirit within and around us," he is presupposing a view of Christ as the incarnation of a Kantian Christian idealism that stands in direct opposi- tion to Jewish materialism. Since religion, not race, is the focus of point 24, the opposite of Jewish-materialism would be Christian-idealism, not German-idealism. The logic im- plicit in point 24 could be stated thus: Jews, as materialists, are totally determined by the mechanistic laws of natural necessity, which is why they stand in deadly opposition to Christ and Christianity. Within this framework, Christians, as idealists, can transcend the mechanistic laws of natural necessity, and consequently, if they want to make Germany a Christian nation, then they have no alternative but to negate "the spirit of Jewish material- ism within us and without us." For Hitler and the Nazis, this Christian idealism /Jewish materialism binary comes directly from the New Testament, and specifically Christ. For instance, in an essay titled Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin: A Dialogue between Adolf Hitler and Me, Dietrich Eckart, an early Nazi ideologue and a man to whom Hitler dedicated Mein Kampf - among the heroes of National Socialism, Hitler asserts in his concluding dedication, Eckart was "one of the best, who devoted his life to the awakening of his, our people, in his writing and his thoughts and finally in his deeds" (687) - has his Hitler persona argue that one of the problems plaguing contemporary culture is a misunderstanding of Christ: "Christ was not so tolerant. With a whip he put a stop to the business of the 'children of the devil/ even though he had said, 'Love your enemy'!" (35). Hitler alludes to this same scriptural passage in both his April 12, 1922 speech - "In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison" (19-20) - as well as in Mein Kampf - "His [the Jew's] life is only of this world, and his spirit is inwardly as alien to true Christianity as his nature two thousand years previous was to the great founder of the new doctrine. Of course, the latter made no secret of his attitude toward the Jewish people, and when necessary he even took to the whip to drive from the temple of the Lord this adversary of all humanity" (307). The true Christ was anti-Jewish, which Eckart' s Hitler confirms by quoting John 8:44, in which Jews are described as being of their "father the devil." In Goebbels's 1929 novel Michael, the title character, who is loosely based on Goebbels, uses the New Testament in exactly the same way as Hitler and Eckart. Michael claims that "[t]he German quest for God is not to be separated from Christ." This quest for God, Michael continues, is not just something that the Germans need for their own personal well-being; it is essential for the life of the nation, for "[a] nation without religion is like a man without breath" (120). Central to Michael's view of Christianity is his conviction that Christ, in his very being, is the exact opposite of the Jew: "Christ is the genius of love, as such the most diametrical opposite of Judaism, which is the incarnation of hate" (65). Thus, Michael concludes that "Christ is the first great enemy of the Jews" (65). Not surprisingly, Michael, like Hitler and Eckart, references the scriptural passage about the money changers in order to justify his anti-Semitic version of Christ: "Christ is harsh and 112</page><page sequence="14">CALLALOO relentless. He drives the Jewish money-changers out of the temple" (39). What is most significant is that, once Christ and the Jew were scripturally pitted against each other as mortal enemies, neither Christians nor Jews could escape from this deadly dynamic: "The Jew is the lie personified. When he crucified Christ, he crucified everlasting truth for the first time in history. This was repeated dozens of times during the next twenty centuries as is being repeated again today" (65-66). What the Christian and the Jew were two thousand years ago is what they are today, and the source for this view is the Bible. Julius Streicher, editor of Der Stürmer, published from 1923 through 1945 articles and images in his newspaper that most clearly and crudely articulated the theological basis of the Nazis' Christian anti-Semitic politics. This newspaper enjoyed enormous support among Germans, for as Streicher's biographer, Randall L. Bytwerk, claims: Der Stürmer "had been one of the most widely circulated papers in Germany, the one paper Hitler himself claimed to read from cover to cover" (1-2). Given the paper's success, Heinrich Himmler claimed that in the future, "it will be said that Julius Streicher and his weekly newspaper the Stürmer were responsible for a good part of the education about the en- emy [the Jew] of mankind" (qtd. in Bytwerk 171). Himmler was not alone in holding this view, for as Bytwerk claims: "The minister of finance under Hitler, Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, concluded that Streicher had exerted 'an influence on Germany than can only be compared with that of Goebbels' s propaganda'" (172). While there are literally hundreds of images from Der Stürmer that articulate the Christian anti-Semitic agenda of the Nazi Party, one from an April 1930 issue best pictures Hitler's Christian view. In this image, Christ is pictured whipping the Jews, thus underscoring the Nazi view that Christ and Christianity entail the negation of the Jew.17 Worth noting is that Eckart, Hitler, Goebbels, and Streicher ultimately use the Bible exactly as Hurston claims, that is, in order to define the Jew in both the past and the pres- ent as essentially the same. In other words, the Jew is not a being that evolves; rather, the Jew "has been there since the beginning of history" (Eckart 5), doing his damage behind the scenes. Eckart's Hitler arrives at this conclusion on the basis of his interpretation of the Old Testament, which clearly depicts the immutable nature of "that eternal mischief- maker, the Jew" (Eckart 17). After doing a brief analysis of Joshua and Isaiah, Eckart's Hitler draws the following conclusion: "'And in all eternity nothing will change/ he [Hitler] proceeded, 'so far as the attitude of the Jews toward our kings and our leaders is concerned. To destroy them is their eternal aim, and when they can't accomplish this by force, they will use cunning'" (Eckart 16). The Jews' propensity to undermine govern- ments has specifically impacted Christian nations, for as Eckart's Hitler says of the Jews: "And the game they're playing today, they have been at for two thousand years" (21). What the Jew was two thousand years ago is what he is today, which is why Hitler, after alluding to the New Testament passage about Christ taking the whip, draws the following conclusion: "How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison to-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before in the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice" (Speeches 20). The battle Hitler is fighting in the present is the same one Christ fought two-thousand years ago, which indicates the degree to which both Jews and Christians have been pressed like crushed flowers between the leaves of the Bible. 113</page><page sequence="15">CALLALOO An image from an April 1930 issue of the weekly German newspaper Der Stürmer. What I am ultimately trying to demonstrate is that Hurston accurately portrayed the Christian political theology that gave birth to the National Socialist attack on the Jews. Kant, Chamberlain, Eckart, Rosenberg, Goebbels, Streicher, and Hitler all picture Jews as mindless automatons, who blindly follow the Mosaic Law and therefore stand in stark contrast to Christ and His sui generis Law of the spirit, which is based on the freedom to determine the environment rather than be determined by it. Hurston describes the image of the Jew that most twentieth-century Christians would adopt: "long before the arrival of the first century ВС the practice of Judaism had become mechanical and rigid, the priest- hood cynical and cold, and this consequent mechanical adherence to ancient form was the direct parent of the morality of the Pharisees which Christ so persistently denounced" (Introduction A 4). This is the Christian picture of the Jews, not only as they were in the 114</page><page sequence="16">CALLALOO past, but also as they are in the present, which is why Hurston suggests that the Jews have been crushed like a flower between the leaves of the Bible, and it is this view of the Jew that Kant and Chamberlain used in order to formulate a coherent Christian political agenda, which Eckart, Streicher, Rosenberg, the Party Program, Hitler, and Goebbels used to lay the foundation for National Socialism. Hurston' s work on Herod is radical enough, but it becomes even more so when we take into account claims that she makes in the bowdlerized chapter from Dust Tracks and her essay, "What White Publishers Won't Print/' In the bowdlerized chapter, Hurston notes how New Testament theology functioned to displace Jews as the Chosen People. After examining how the ancient Hebrews formulated a Chosen People theology in order to justify dominating and even exterminating Canaanites, she then examines how Christians internalized this Chosen People theology in order to justify their violation of Jews. Hur- ston' s point is not simply that the early church was anti-Semitic; she is trying to explain the contemporary political situation, which is why she claims that "two thousand years have gone by and all the Western World uses the sign of the Cross, and it is evident that the Jews are not the only ones who do not accept it" (Dust Tracks 245-46). Two thousand years later and Christianity's Chosen People theology, Hurston suggests, is now the Western world's basis and foundation for subjugating and violating Jews and many others. Hur- ston's vagueness about the Jews not being "the only ones" who fail to accept Christianity should not be seen as intellectual sloppiness on her part. She is suggesting that, in order to understand the demonization of various minorities in the twentieth century, we need to examine the originary source for this demonization, which is the Christian depiction of the Jew. Put differently, the model that early Christians developed in order to justify their violation of the Jews is the same model that twentieth-century Christians use to violate contemporary Jews and many others. She incisively defines the nature of this model in her 1950 essay, "What White Publish- ers Won't Print." In this essay, Hurston argues that there is an insidious dynamic between publishers and readers, which explains "the lack of literature about the higher emotions and love life of upper-class Negroes and the minorities in general" (170). "Publishing houses," Hurston rightly notes, "are in business to make money" (170), but they are con- strained by "the subconscious of the majority" (172), which has been structured on the assumption "that all non- Anglo-Saxons are uncomplicated stereotypes" (170). Therefore, to ensure profit, American publishers only print books that portray minorities as "figures mounted" on a wall, composed "of bent wires without insides at all" (170). Given the publishing houses' tendency to print only books that ignore "the internal life of educated minorities" (170), Hurston, with characteristic wit, offers a sophisticated interpretation of this behavior by referring to the situation in the United States as "THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF UNNATURAL HISTORY" (170). If natural history charts the evolution of species and beings by strategically exposing their various stages of development, history in the United States should be considered unnatural, because it ignores the complex evolu- tion of non- Anglo-Saxons by reifying them into "uncomplicated stereotypes." Minorities, and Hurston specifies blacks and Jews in her essay, are defined in relation to "unnatural history." Therefore, when Anglo-Saxons look at the non- Anglo-Saxon, they do not see a being that is subject to the "natural laws of evolution." They see a static being that tran- scends time and space - just as the Sinai-Theophany Jew is exactly the same as the modern 115</page><page sequence="17">CALLALOO German Jew, so too is the Kongo Kingdom black of the fifteenth century exactly the same as the Chicago black of the twentieth century. While Hurston in her "White Publishers" essay does not identify Christianity as the source for the "unnatural history" that would become natural for twentieth-century Chris- tian nations, she does make that argument in the bowdlerized chapter from Dust Tracks as well as the Herod manuscript, two works that white publishers wouldn't print. It is tempting, of course, to suggest that white publishers wouldn't print those works because Hurston identified the basis and foundation for twentieth-century political racism, which is the Christian myth that Jesus Christ is God. Without the myth of Christ's sui generis origins, the "unnatural history" that traps Jews and others within a static biblical image of an uncomplicated stereotype as well as Christians within a dynamic biblical image of sui generis transcendence would be incoherent. According to Hurston, therefore, the time after Christ's death marks a decisive moment in history (or "unnatural history," as the case may be), because an important choice had to be made. Either a reasonable Christian religion could have come into being, one that would have honestly acknowledged its intellectual, political, and philosophical precursors and thereby rendered unnecessary a politics of distortion and misrepresentation ("unnatural history"), or an unrealistic Christian religion could have come into being, one that would have portrayed itself in terms of a sui generis transcendence ("A SUDDEN AND MIRACU- LOUS HAPPENING AS IS TOLD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT"), which necessitates a misrepresentation of Jews and others in order to justify its divine (non-human) origins and character. In choosing the latter, Christians crushed Jews (Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes) between the leaves of the Bible, thus preventing Christians from seeing Jews as people subject to the laws of natural evolution. In like manner, this sui generis version of Christ and Christianity duped Christians into believing that they, like Christ, stand above other people and nations because of their capacity to transcend the natural laws of evolu- tion. More than anything else, the choice of early Christians incarcerated later Christians within a conceptual model that is not only untrue and incoherent but also politically de- structive, according to Hurston. And it is this model that led twentieth-century Christians to demonize not just Jews but also many others. Therefore, in her Herod manuscript, Hurston offers readers more than just a new inter- pretation of the specific version of Christianity that gave birth to Hitler and the Nazis. She offers a more accurate picture of the age. Scholars in Hurston's day would have probably dismissed her work as charmingly uninformed, because they subscribed to two separate myths: that secularization was well underway and that National Socialism was a secular and, therefore, anti-Christian political movement. But now that scholars are finally expos- ing these two ideas as unfounded, Hurston's Herod manuscript is not merely proving to be much more relevant. It is actually proving to be right.

Plant briefly mentions Herod in Every Tub Must Sit on Its Own Bottom (36, 164), but it is in Zora Neale Hurston: A Biography of the Spirit that she does an extensive analysis of the manuscript (133-62). 2. Hurston wrote four introductions and three prefaces to her Herod manuscript, and none of these have been published. When I refer to the page number in a preface or an introduction, I am using the page number that is at the top of Hurston's original typewritten manuscript housed in the University of Florida's Smathers library. 3. In a foreword to Moses, Man of the Mountain, Deborah E. McDowell rightly claims that Hurston had Hitler and the Nazis in mind as she was working on the essays that examined twentieth-century anti-Semitism. 4. For an extensive analysis of Feuerbach's theories about anthropomorphism, see The Essence of Christianity. Weber introduces his theory of secularization in his essay, "Science as a Vocation." Freud formulates an incisive critique of religion in his 1921 book, Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, but it was in his 1927 book, The Future of an Illusion, and in his 1930 book, Civilization and Its Discontents, that he defined religion as an illusion and delusion. For a discussion of Anderson's secularization approach to the emerging nation state, see Imagined Communities. And for the most spirited defense of traditional secularization theory, see Bruce's God is Dead: Secularization in the West. 5. Black writers, in particular, have been rejecting the secularization hypothesis for some time. For instance, in an early unpublished lecture version of his 1957 book White Man, Listen!, Richard Wright claims: "The Mid-Twentieth Century finds more active religion on earth than at any time since 1455! This is a startling fact and I do not think that it has been sufficiently weighed, studied, and appreciated" (qtd. in Lackey, "Sacred" 61). In The Fire Next Time, James Baldwin claims that the major struggle for twentieth-century writers is to examine "the historical role of Christianity in the realm of power - that is, politics" (45). Not surprisingly, Baldwin suggests that Christianity informed the Nazis' political agenda, which is why he claims that "the fact of the Third Reich alone makes obsolete forever any question of Christian superiority" (52). Kwame Anthony Appiah argues in In My Father's House that "[secularization seems hardly to be proceeding: religions grow in all parts of the world; more than ninety percent of North Americans still avow some sort of theism" (145). Ap- piah concedes that secularization may have occurred in the "world of the higher academy and a few islands of its influence" (145), but as for everyday citizens, secularization has simply not occurred. For an extended discussion of the reasons why so many black writers rejected the secularization hypothesis, see my essay, "The Sacred Imagined Nation: Challenging the Modernist Secularization Hypothesis." 6. Many contemporary scholars continue to approach Hitler and the Nazis through the lens ot secu- larization. For instance, see Theodore Ziolkowski's Modes of Faith, Charles Taylor's A Secular Age, and Richard Weikart's From Darwin to Hitler. 7. Obviously, there have been many writers who have noted before 1990 the role Christianity has played in making the Holocaust possible. For instance, in a moment of clear frustration, Eli Wiesel fumes in a 1977 lecture: "If I want to understand, and never will, why my people turned into victims, into perfect victims, somebody will have to understand or try to understand why all the killers were Christians, bad Christians surely, but Christians" (17). In The Destruction of the European Jews (1961), Raul Hilberg begins his study by comparing and contrasting important Christian documents and Nazi anti-Jewish measures (1-17). In both The Cunning of History (1975) and After Auschwitz (1966), Richard L. Rubenstein examines the degree to which Christianity made Auschwitz possible. Recent scholars such as Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, Philippe Burrin, James Waller, and Kevin Spicer have made important contributions to our understanding of the extensive role Christianity played in creating the conditions for the Holocaust to occur. 8. There has been much confusion when discussing Hitler's and the Nazis' Christian conception of the political, which derives mainly from the tendency to treat Christianity as an ahistorical transcendental signifier. For instance, Burrin rightly notes that the Nazis' "German nationalism has been infused by Christian religiosity" (33), but he later refers to the Nazis' Christianity as a "pseudo-Christian religiosity" (38). The problem is this: Hitler claims that what distinguishes National Socialism is its commitment to "true Christianity," as I will discuss later in this essay. As a scholar, instead of claim- ing that I have epistemological access to true Christianity, and then assessing Hitler's and the Nazis' Christianity in relation to that true concept, I argue that we, as scholars, should resist the impulse to analyze Hitler and the Nazis in relation to a transcendental signifier such as true Christianity, and instead, we should define Christianity as Hitler and the Nazis understood it. In my estimation, 117</page><page sequence="19">CALLALOO Christian idealism best articulates the version of Christianity that Hitler and many Nazis take as a given. 9. Kaplan (Hurston, Letters 602) and Plant (Zora 161) discuss the editors' rejections of the Herod manu- script. 10. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. speculates in an appendix to Dust Tracks why Hurston's chapter was not in- cluded: "Obviously written prior to December 7, 1941, the chapter contains too many anti- American statements to be published after Pearl Harbor" (212). In the conclusion to this essay, I will suggest another reason for its exclusion. 11. In Anti-Semite and Jew, Jean-Paul Sartre examines the degree to which the Jew is denned in the West as a "metaphysical essence" (38), which prohibits Jews from growing and evolving. He, like Hurston, goes on to claim that "it is no exaggeration to say that it is the Christians who have created the Jew" (68). 12. Hurston was extremely critical of Moses, which she indicates most clearly when she refers to him as a "dictator" (530) in a letter to Van Vechten. For a more extensive analysis of Hurston's vicious critique of Moses, see my forthcoming essay, "Moses, Man of Oppression: A Twentieth-Century African- American Critique of Western Theocracy," which will be published in issue 43.4 of African American Review. 13. Arendt s response to Eichmann s claim is very telling: This was outrageous, on the face of it, and also incomprehensible, since Kant's moral philosophy is so closely bound up with man's faculty of judgment, which rules out blind obedience" (136). Arendt's contemptuous dismissal of Eichmann's assertion about Kant and her subsequent defense of Kant's moral philosophy (136-37) reflect the unfortunate trend among scholars. Instead of rigorously analyzing Eichmann's logic in relation to Kant's moral philosophy, scholars have casually dismissed such assertions as ignorant, incoherent, and /or absurd. The result has been a failure to understand some of the crucial intellectual sources of National Socialism. Fortunately, recent scholars have started to examine more carefully the rela- tionship between Kant and the Nazis, as I will indicate. 14. Scholars have been increasingly examining the degree to which Kant laid the groundwork for the Final Solution. In Act and Idea in the Nazi Genocide, Berel Lang argues that there can "be found in Kant, or, more broadly, in the Enlightenment, certain conceptual or ideological origins of Nazi genocide" (168). In German Idealism and the Jew, Michael Mack examines the anti-Semitic road from Kant to Hitler through the lens of German idealism. In an attempt to understand the "connection between eighteenth-century aesthetics and twentieth-century genocide" (1170), Karen Feldman does a close analysis of Kant's and Schiller's theories of the sublime. While I am in general agreement with the impulse animating the work of Mills, Lang, Mack, and Feldman, I offer a different approach to the Nazi appropriation of Kant's work. Indeed, I would say that it is impossible to understand Kant's anti-Semitism without taking into account his specific view of Christ and Christianity. 15. For the most extensive analyses of Kant s influence on Chamberlain's thinking, see Field 278-316; Stackelberg 132-44. 16. That Jews are trapped in the mechanistic world of the senses, that their relationship to God is ex- clusively political, and that Christianity supersedes Judaism through freedom - Chamberlain lifted each of these ideas from Kant's book, Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone (116-20). 1 7. This image was published in the April 1930 issue of Der Stürmer (number 16). Since all Nazi-supported organizations were abolished after World War II, there is no one who can give me permission to publish this image. WORKS CITED Anderson, Benedict.
