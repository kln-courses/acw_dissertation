<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael A. Bryson Empty Lots and Secret Places: Leonard Dubkin's Exploration of Urban Nature in Chicago It's an easy place to miss- a modest triangle of urban parkland merely a quarter-acre or so in size, bordered by a street, an alley, and an imposingly tall concrete wall of Chicago's elevated train line. When I first visited it in March 2007, a few large, leafless trees arched overhead, hinting of summer shade they would soon provide. The grass began to display signs of spring's green exuberance, and the long El trains rumbling by formed a dramatic linear contrast to the expansive sky. In a city of grandly scaled public parks and a glorious 25-mile lakefront, even native Chicagoans possessing street savvy and an eye for nature can overlook the presence of such a small, undistinguished park. For nearly four years, I lived within six blocks of that humble wedge of open space in the Chicago neighborhood of Rogers Park, yet I have no memory of ever seeing or walking through it. In retro- spect, my missing it seems emblematic of how the natural landscape can become an invisible presence in the city milieu. This patch of green, christened "Dubkin Park" by the city in 1974, will never qualify as an aesthetic jewel within the Chicago park system. With only a few scattered benches and no playground or exercise equipment, it's not a suitable haven for recreation or fitness. But Dubkin Park is an excellent place to contemplate urban nature. It inspires us to ask questions about the environmental history (and future) of Chicago and other large cities, as well as to muse upon the Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 18.1 (Winter 2011) Advance Access publication February 16, 2011 doi:10.1093/isle/isql21 Â© The Author(s) 2011 .

The reasons for this include its plain-ness, small scale, and constructed identity, all of which are representative of nature in urban environments in general. Another reason: its namesake, Leonard Dubkin (1905-72), an urban naturalist and Chicago writer who immersed himself in Chicago's natural history long before the recent rediscovery of urban environments by literary critics and nature writers. Like the park that commemorates him, Dubkin has been easy to overlook. Although he penned several books on nature in the city, wrote a widely read nature column for Lerner Newspapers in Chicago for many years, and published frequently in major national newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and New York Times , Dubkin today is a virtual unknown.1 Yet the recent resurgence of interest in the environmental issues and history of urban areas in general and the Chicago region in par- ticular makes Dubkin's work important. His writings are a rich his- torical document of urban nature as well as a detailed exploration of one person's engagement with the "wild" elements of the city: plants, birds, insects, mammals, and various representatives of the human population. Dubkin has much to say not just to Chicagoans interested in their city's environment or to aficionados of nature writing, but to all who are engaged in the conservation, preservation, restoration, and representation of urban nature. He speaks, as well, to city and suburban dwellers who feel alienated from an idealized nature they imagine exists only "out there," away from urban sprawl and conges- tion. Dubkin's essays and books extol the value of the commonplace and mundane for exploring biological adaptation and ecological com- plexity, illustrate the rewards of patient observation of and direct experience with natural phenomena, and explore the inescapable interconnection of humanity and nature in the urban landscape. This essay identifies key elements of Dubkin's representation of urban nature and analyzes some revealing tensions in his discourse. For one, Dubkin embraces familiar forms of nature even as he values "secret places" in the city and the glimpses into the wild such settings afford; for another, the antagonistic nature/culture opposition implied in his articulation of wilderness in the city is ultimately undercut by his insistence on acknowledging the human presence in and impact upon urban nature. Finally, I discuss the relevance of Dubkin's work to the burgeoning urban environmental movement called "Chicago Wilderness."</page><page sequence="3">Empty Lots and Secret Places 49 Negotiating the Urban Turn While of late there has been an "urban turn" in the broad arena of environmental studies- particularly within the practice of ecocriti- cism and the genre of nature writing- ecologists, physical and cul- tural geographers, and environmental historians have been studying city environments for quite some time. Several illustrative studies among this wide-ranging, multidisciplinary work, in fact, center on Chicago. Representative texts include Henry Chandler Cowles' land- mark ecological study, The Plant Societies of Chicago and Vicinity (1901); Harold Mayer and Richard Wades' illustrated history Chicago : Growth of a Metropolis (1969); William Cronon's influential environ- mental/economic history of Chicago, Nature's Metropolis (1991); Joel Greenberg's comprehensive regional work A Natural History of the Chicago Region (2004); and John Hudson's recent synthesis Chicago : A Geography of the City and Its Region (2006). Despite a longstanding critical tradition focusing on literature of the city- exemplified by Carlo Rotella's portraits of Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York in October Cities (1998)- ecocritical studies have only much more recently come to view the urban land- scape as a productive site of inquiry.2 Michael Bennett argues that ecocriticism's intellectual and geographic roots in rural and "wild" environments "tends to engage in a form of wilderness fetishism . . . that disables it from offering a useful analysis of urban environ- ments" (33). Bennett advocates the application of "social ecocriti- cism"- a braided stream of cultural critique and critical theory that "reject [s] mainstream ecocriticism's focus on the genres of nature writing and pastoral" and instead highlights the "complex inter- actions between political choices, socio-economic structures, and . . . densely-populated ecosystems" (31-2). His essay seeks to reinvigor- ate ecocritical discourse and challenge the essentialist opposition of nature and culture inherent in the overlooking of urban environ- ments. It's also, I would suggest, an implicit plea to seek out and recover authors, texts, and ideas that explore the history and character of urban nature.3 Evolution of an Urban Nature Writer One such writer was Leonard Dubkin, who until his death in 1972 explored everyday nature within parks and forest preserves, empty lots, the industrialized riverfront, patches of open land between housing developments, tenement slums, dank underground pas- sages, railroad embankments, and sidewalk cracks. From his</page><page sequence="4">50 ISLE observations of these places, Dubkin created a fascinating discourse of urban nature that is singular in Chicago's literary history as well as relevant to contemporary efforts in re-imagining how nature func- tions (and might flourish) in the environment of cities. Dubkin was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1905. Two years later his family emigrated to the United States and soon settled on the near West Side of Chicago, an area of the city that served as a portal for Jewish immigrants, particularly those of Eastern-European ancestry. One of seven children, young Leonard cultivated an interest in the natural world from the time he was nine, and spent a great deal of time exploring the city's remnant natural areas he would later recall as some of his "secret places." Though he left school before finishing eighth grade so he could work (at jobs like cleaning out taverns and selling newspapers) to help support his family, Dubkin nevertheless found time to collect plant and animal specimens, write down his observations in a journal, and cultivate an ambition to become a naturalist.4 Though his formal education was cut short, and he never became a professional scientist as he once fantasized, Dubkin was as much enthralled by science as he was by nature itself, and from an early age steeped himself in the writings of naturalists, especially Darwin. Consequently, Dubkin always grounded his observations of the natural world in his extensive reading of both popular and technical scientific literature, which he accessed in the diverse collections of Chicago's public libraries- his substitute for a university experience. In contrast, Dubkin's literary ambitions were much more fully rea- lized. As a journalist, Dubkin worked for several papers penning nature columns over the course of his life, including a youthful gig with the Chicago Daily News and a brief stint later at the Chicago Tribune. From the late 1950s onward, he was a fixture at Lerner Newspapers in Chicago as a news reporter and nature writer. His popular and long-running "Birds and Bees" column contained folksy yet scientifically informed observations on urban nature, and enjoyed a dedicated readership throughout the city. Most significantly, Dubkin produced a string of meditative and observation-rich books on various aspects of Chicago's natural history, starting with The Murmur of Wings in 1944 and ending in 1972 with My Secret Places. Dubkin also maintained friendships and regular correspondence with important writers, naturalists, and scientists of his day, includ- ing Ben Hecht, Nelson Algren, Rachel Carson, and Loren Eiseley. In fact, it is Eiseley who penned what might be the most eloquent tribute to Dubkin's skill and significance as a city-based naturalist-</page><page sequence="5">Empty Lots and Secret Places 51 writer. In a 1972 letter to Dubkin he included a carbon copy of a draft dust-jacket blurb for Dubkin's final book, My Secret Places : Mr. Dubkin has no parallel as the naturalist of the city and its environs. An able and expert journalist, he has the heart and eye of a child. It is this which convinces those of us lost in adult affairs that there is still truly a hidden place between the last billboard and the viaduct, a place as worthy of preservation as a forest. In such spots a rare human gentleness can sometimes be nurtured. Leonard Dubkin is a graduate of that kind of innocent back lot school which Americans are close to losing forever. His work is not only readable, it is utterly sincere.5 Himself a longtime resident of Philadelphia's suburbs, Eiseley recog- nized not just the singularity of Dubkin's unique perspective and lit- erary ability but also the value of Dubkin's lifelong efforts to bring the neglected yet fascinating manifestations of urban nature to light. Nature Familiar: Exploring the Commonplace Eiseley's comments signal a major theme of Dubkin's work: his exploration of commonplace nature within everyday urban environ- ments. In The Natural History of a Yard (1955), an intimate and reveal- ing account of three years' worth of observations of the city's natural history, Dubkin focuses on the small fenced lawn fronting his north- side apartment building in Chicago. Here, with his young daughter Pauline, Dubkin uncovers the surprising possibilities of urban natural history for revealing insights about plant-animal interactions; the be- havioral ecology of insects, birds, and mammals; anthropomorphism and the scientific attitude toward nature; and the varied and conflict- ing attitude of humans toward the neglected and sometimes vilified manifestations of urban nature. The Natural History of a Yard celebrates the variety and resilience of nature in the challenging city environ- ment and inspires our latent capacity to recognize and appreciate the common examples of wildlife amidst the city's concrete edifices and hurrying human masses. Dubkin provides a forthright and instructive "credo" in the book's introduction: It seems to me that people are forever traveling great distances, and journeying to strange countries, to see things that, if they only knew it, exist beside their own doorstep. The common animals, birds and insects that</page><page sequence="6">52 ISLE are found in a little yard in the city are as fascinating to watch, and as fruitful in affording the careful observer a glimpse into some of the mysteries of nature, as are the rare and uncommon creatures of some far-off land. Whether one goes to nature for truth, or for beauty, for knowledge or for relaxation, these things can be found in a yard in the city as well as in a tropical jungle, for they exist in the common, simple, everyday things all about us, as well as in the rare and exotic. (6) Notable here is the argument that commonplace nature- the familiar (and, implicitly, unloved species)- holds as much interest and value as the charismatic nature displayed in exotic locales. This interest has both intellectual appeal ("truth") for those who seek to learn about, say, animal behavior, ecological adaptations, predator-prey relation- ships, or other "mysteries of nature," and aesthetic appeal ("beauty") for those in search of repose and reflection in communion with the natural world. Dubkin accomplishes this by dint of exceptionally patient or serendipitous observations, and sometimes through simple yet cleverly contrived experimentation. Consider, for example, his observations of birds from the vantage point of the yard. Lying on their backs underneath a mature American elm, Dubkin and Pauline note the presence of a screech owl nest high up in the trunk of the tree. The discovery has the feel of an illicit secret, for although Dubkin is aware that screech owls are not rare in urban areas, he did "not believe there was anyone in our building who even suspected that there were owls in our yard" (23). Pauline, however, innocently reveals their presence to a key character of the narrative, Emil, the custodian and groundskeeper for the build- ing. Emil tolerates Dubkin and Pauline's presence in the yard; but he fails to understand and appreciate their keen interest in the yard's natural history, and he immediately perceives the owl as a potential nuisance and threat. Dubkin thus uses Emil as a stand-in for main- stream (and, he would argue, blinkered) views of nature in the city. Dubkin's embrace of the familiar and commonplace is echoed in recent years by the naturalist- writer Robert Michael Pyle, who argues in "The Extinction of Experience" that our lack of familiarity with home landscapes and their native biota can arrest the development of one's appreciation for nature. While Pyle emphasizes the critical problem of local extinctions- specifically, the elimination of locally native species- he also recognizes more generally the value of urban open space for allowing people to come into contact with all kinds of organisms, even the ostensibly "weedy species" of non-native</page><page sequence="7">Empty Lots and Secret Places 53 colonizers. In his Aurora, Colorado, childhood, "unofficial country- side-vacant lots aplenty, a neglected so-called park where weeds had their way, yesterday's farms, and the endless open ground of the High Line Canal looping off east and west"- provided the foun- dation of his education in natural history (Pyle 264-5). For Pyle, as for Dubkin writing four decades earlier, commonplace nature close at hand in the urban landscape is a place where familiarity can be culti- vated and nurtured- even in less than pristine or ecologically degraded landscapes. The Magic of Secret Places Another twist in Dubkin's representation of urban nature is suggested by his front yard as well as the other corners of the city he calls his "secret places"- pockets of green space that exist in out of the way locations or persist in plain view of busy, densely populated areas of the city. His relation of secret and surprising locations serves both to reveal the hidden cityscape to the reader and inspire revel- atory insights about urban nature. Instead of exploring a formal parkland, Dubkin would engage in a detailed and sustained look at, say, a patch of grass- a project that demonstrates both the power of close observation as well as the sur- prising variety and ecological complexity of these artificially main- tained outdoor carpets. After a discussion of the sexual and asexual reproductive strategies of grass in The Natural History of a Yard, he experiences "a sudden revelation; one looks at an object one has seen a thousand times before, perhaps from a new angle or in a different light, and it is a new thing, its shape and form have been myster- iously transformed, and one wonders why one never really saw it before" (108). Dubkin speculates about the possible presence of other plant species in the apparently monocultural lawn of blue grass so carefully maintained by Emil's mowing, fertilizing, and seeding, and "for the first time in my life I actually looked at the grass; I examined each blade in an area of about a square foot, looked between the stems and close to the ground under the blades. And, to my utter astonishment, in half an hour I discovered, growing within that square foot, fifty-two different kinds of plants" (109). The lawn's surprising botanical diversity inspires a later exper- iment, in which Dubkin attempts to determine to what extent this varied assemblage of species is caused by the presence of different seeds already in the blue grass seed mix, or by wind-borne coloniza- tion from other plants in the vicinity. He plants the blue grass seed indoors the next spring, and observes only blue grass shoots emerge;</page><page sequence="8">54 ISLE then, after placing the plant box outside on his fifth-story apartment's balcony, "there were eighteen plants besides the grass growing in the box, and, if a cold spell had not come along just then, I am sure there would have been more" (152-3). The result is, on one level, an empirical verification of the reproductive prowess of various plant species in highly disturbed, artificial landscapes such as cities. On another, it is cause for meditation on the limitations of human control of these landscapes, since the composition of species in any given yard is due as much to "the laws of chance and the survival of the fittest" as to the ministrations of human cultivators (153). Further, it aptly demonstrates how we can deceive ourselves into perceiving uniformity and similarity within a world of varied unpredictability. Here and elsewhere, Dubkin evokes the yard's value as an obser- vational outpost as well as a repository of surprising biological diver- sity and activity, if only one takes time to look closely. The moment is reminiscent of the views of E. O. Wilson, who in the opening chapter of The Future of Life draws our attention not just to the tremendous biodiversity in, say, rainforest ecosystems, but also to the biologically rich and varied world of the temperate forest floor, where he finds dozens of invertebrate species moving through the soil underneath a decomposing log. Even- or especially- in the city, this microcosmic perspective is an important means of perceiving nature's diversity and abundance. As the poet Gary Snyder argues, "Wildness is not limited to the two percent formal wilderness areas. Shifting scales, it is everywhere. . . . Exquisite complex beings in their energy webs inhabiting the fertile corners of the urban world in accord with the rules of wild systems, the visible hardy stalks and stems of vacant lots and railroads, the persistent raccoon squads" (30).6 Sanctuary in the City Urban nature serves another important function in Dubkin's writ- ings: that of sanctuary from the noise, confusion, and anxiety of city life- stresses that Dubkin in his persona as wandering urban natural- ist felt acutely. This idea is most dramatically worked out in 1953's Wolf Point: An Adventure in History. Envisioning Chicago's nature as a sacred space of refuge and mystical experience, Wolf Point maps the wilderness identity of the river's edge from the time of prehistory to the era of French exploration to the days of nineteenth-century settle- ment to Dubkin's own experience in the mid-twentieth century. Like the other "secret places" in Dubkin's work, the undeveloped land around Wolf Point is many things simultaneously: a repository of plant and animal life; a human refuge from the noise, activity, and</page><page sequence="9">Empty Lots and Secret Places 55 stress of the city's pulsing landscape; a haven for direct personal contact with nature; a portal into Chicago's environmental and cul- tural history; and a prime example of "wildness" within the trans- formed and abused urban landscape. In the opening chapter, set in Chicago's downtown, Dubkin describes a short ramble from his office at the nearby Merchandise Mart to the banks of the Chicago River, where he discovers a pathway that provides access to (for him) an undiscovered world within the city's heart: As I stepped cautiously down the side of the embank- ment, turning my head to look from side to side, my eyes opened wide in amazement at what I saw. Here was a whole new unsuspected world, as unbelievable as though I should suddenly come upon a dense tropi- cal jungle while walking in the Loop. Small cottonwood trees grew here and there on either side of the path, the embankment was obscured by the foliage of hundreds of sumac bushes, and between the sumacs and the river, a distance of only three or four feet, there was spread a solid carpet of wildflowers, of weeds and little bushes and vines and creepers. . . . How beautiful all this was, and how wonderful to come upon it so unex- pectedly, to find here in the midst of the city a little spot that was wild and untouched by civilization, and teemed with natural beauty. (14-5) This passage illustrates Dubkin's eye for detail, to be sure- but it also stresses the uniqueness of this biological refuge within the heart of Chicago, a place where vegetation as well as bird and insect life dom- inate the landscape and capture the attention of an attuned observer. Dubkin (perhaps knowingly) overstates things when he suggests that this green strip at Wolf Point is "untouched by civilization," but the riotous vegetation and animal presence there contrast so strongly with the concrete embankments across the river, the soaring Loop buildings, and the noisy roads and elevated train tracks that the place seems wild by comparison. More importantly, Wolf Point represents a human sanctuary "invisible from up above, [so] that no one on the other side of the embankment could possibly guess that such a place existed here" (18). Such concealment is part of the value of the place as an escape, a portal away from the world of work and human intercourse, of noise and the exchange of money. Moreover, "just as this place was invisible from any other part of the city, the city itself was invisible</page><page sequence="10">56 ISLE when one was sitting here. Its sights and its sounds and its smells and its hustle and bustle were as distant and as imperceptible as though I had traveled for hours to get away from them" (18-9). It is this dual sense of invisibility that defines this ultimate in city refuges- a place where sound is muted, where the pace of life slows to a crawl, where nature commands one's attention: Set in the midst of a big city, at the foot of the largest commercial building in the world, surrounded by tall buildings and traffic-clogged streets, here was a secluded spot where things moved at a leisurely pace, like some undiscovered bit of land beside a forgotten river. No sound of screeching brakes or auto horns, of roaring trucks or policemen's whistles, outraged the still air that carried only the gurgling of the river, the shrilling of insects and the chirping of sparrows. It was true that across the river every ten minutes or so the silence exploded as a locomotive shot out of the tunnel and puffed across the empty space toward some build- ings in the distance; but this sound did not seem to profane the stillness, it was like hearing the far off chug- ging of a train from some quiet spot in the country. (19) This representation constitutes an urban pastoral landscape- not the bucolic middle ground between city and wilderness that we tra- ditionally characterize as cultivated rural land, but a relatively tran- quil place of repose within the urban matrix that provides the illusion of the country by virtue of its immediate contrast with the built environment that surrounds it. Note, though, the important qualification here- -the noise of the train which "exploded" onto the scene across the river, a verb choice which signals something more harsh than a friendly train whistle- and the way such an intrusion impacts Dubkin's assessment of the scene. Unlike, say, Thoreau, who found the sound of the nineteenth century locomotive a disturbing sign of technology's trespass onto and reshaping of nature,7 Dubkin interprets the train noise as a benign element of the urban pastoral landscape, yet another part of the nostalgic illusion of a country setting in the heart of the city. But if Wolf Point presents an alternative version of the American (urban) pastoral, it also exhorts us to contemplate the jarring possi- bility of seeing "wilderness" in the city. Dubkin describes the area adjacent to this pathway as "a trackless, pathless wilderness of little trees and bushes and high plants that would be as difficult to get through as the thick undergrowth in a jungle, and where a single</page><page sequence="11">Empty Lots and Secret Places 57 false step might send one splashing into the river" (15-6). This is one of the very few times in his six books when Dubkin explicitly uses the word "wilderness"- here the term refers to a place unexplored and unmarked by human presence, one that is inherently difficult to traverse and fraught with danger. Another important dimension of this urban wilderness is the vibrant plant and animal activity it sup- ports-here is a place to observe and marvel at the wild, unloved weeds that would have been pulled up immediately, if they had happened to sprout anywhere else in the city, in garden or lawn or back yard. But here they found a fertile soil and freedom from mankind, and their only enemies were the other plants that vied with them for root space under the ground and a place in the sun above, and the insects that devoured their leaves. Here beside the river the natural conditions of existence held sway, as they had before man came to the earth. (31) Consider how Dubkin's mid-twentieth-century conception of what constitutes "natural conditions" differs from that of contemporary ecological restoration, which emphasizes the importance of native flora and fauna (and conversely, the threat of non-natives) to the environmental quality of a region. The related practices of habitat conservation and ecological restoration stress the presence and abun- dance of native plants as a sign of a healthy landscape (and thus a true "remnant" of the area's ecological heritage). In contrast, non- native plants are a tangible sign of disturbance and human encroach- ment, of a cultural reshaping of the land.8 Dubkin's assessment of this tiny fragment of wilderness, though, draws no distinction between native and non-native species. He views the seemingly unfettered competition among plants and animals, predator and prey, as indicative of a thriving wild nature where, he believes, evolution can run its "natural" course. To be sure, this logic is somewhat misleading, as the entire river ecosystem sur- rounding Wolf Point- including the directional flow of the river itself, which was reversed around 1900- has been dramatically altered by sustained human intervention. Consequently, the residents of Wolf Point are not isolated relics of a past wilderness but rather inhabitants of an altered landscape. Nevertheless, it is the interplay of life, the energetic biodiversity of a place that is the result of efficient reproductive strategies, that impresses Dubkin in this urban sanctu- ary and grants it a "wild" quality.</page><page sequence="12">58 ISLE People Are Nature, Too The representation of urban nature as remnant wilderness and spiritual sanctuary, as Dubkin portrays it in Wolf Point , draws from and reinforces the centuries-old opposition between civilization and wilderness that continues to shape popular assumptions about nature in cities. In such a formulation, the city as built (unnatural) environ- ment represents the antithesis of wilderness (pristine nature). Surprisingly, though, another thread in Dubkin's portrait of nature in the city- his integration of humans within the urban landscape- serves to partially deconstruct this dichotomy. The tension, then, between upholding and undermining the city /nature ideological divide both provides an important interpretative lens for reading Dubkin's urban natural histories and anticipates the later critiques of scholars who have interrogated wilderness as a cultural construct.9 This thread is prominent in Dubkin's last book, My Secret Places, which is simultaneously a historical tour of Dubkin's favorite Chicago sanctuaries and a rueful reflection on the erosion of urban nature. Dubkin here enumerates a depressing litany of the city's eco- logical problems: loss of biodiversity; isolation of residents from the lakefront; pervasive air and water pollution; decimation of the region's American elms by Dutch elm disease; and loss of open space to rampant, unplanned development. In doing so, he provides an ecological version of the narrative of "decline" one literary critic traces within the physical and social land- scapes of Chicago and other cities during the post- WWII era (Rotella 26-7, 38-9). Dubkin thus articulates two tensions- ecological rich- ness vs. degradation, and nature vs. civilization- that had long pro- vided thematic structure to his writings about Chicago. It is only in My Secret Places , though, published ten years after Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and informed by the burgeoning environmental move- ment of the 1960s, that these tensions are manifest within a forceful critique of human arrogance and the technological control of nature: So it is that mankind serves notice to nature- to all the creatures large and small that share this planet with us. Be beautiful, be interesting, be wild, we say to them, but keep your distance, do not, even unwittingly, inter- fere with our lives or our plans or our comings and goings. If you do, we will exterminate you, we will eliminate you completely from the earth. . . . We have DDT, we have the atom bomb, and we have become past masters in the art of destructiveness. (45-7)</page><page sequence="13">Empty Lots and Secret Places 59 This passage is telling in its evocation of ostensibly "wild" creatures such as rabbits, pigeons, and squirrels. From an urban ecology per- spective, they are recognizable symbols of domesticated nature in urban areas- common species that can adapt readily to the human presence and carve out a successful existence in the built landscape. But for Dubkin, the important issues are the scale of possible control enabled by tools such as chemical pesticides, and a human relation to the natural world characterized by arrogance and the specter of potential violence. In this new world, regrettably, humanity decides what kind of nature will be privileged to exist, and where. Yet this pessimistic vision is tempered by Dubkin's own sustained engagement with urban nature, one which not only values the dis- covery and exploration of nature in unlikely or unpromising locations, but also dramatizes the integration of the city's human inhabitants with its natural history. My Secret Places , consequently, is also a book about people as well as geography, for it is rife with char- acters-some intriguing, others shadowy, a few sympathetic to the narrator's iconoclastic view on the urban landscape. The most com- pelling of these is the unnamed vagrant who temporarily dwells in a small vacant parcel on the city's far north side. In the chapter, "The Empty Lot," Dubkin recounts how he once came upon an unex- pected green oasis: a small meadow bordered by two sets of railroad tracks and concealed from the street by a large billboard. During his lunch breaks, he sits there observing the plants, insects, and birds, contemplating their ecological adaptations and evolutionary signifi- cance. Yet he also finds evidence of human occupancy: "under the tree [in the lot] was a blanket, spread out as though someone had recently lain on it and near the edge of the blanket was an empty bottle which had contained some sort of cheap wine. Someone slept here at night, perhaps a tramp, probably a wino" (125). The narrator here reveals a degree of uneasiness, a latent fear of the unknown human element and its potential for violence: "Would he be danger- ous? I wondered. If he should come here some day at noon and find me sitting on the embankment, would he assail me with a knife or club, or throw rocks at me?" (135-6). Thus we see two competing manifestations of urban nature in this chapter of My Secret Places- the empty lot as nature sanctuary, a zone of peaceful contemplation and observation; and the empty lot as a vagrant's home, a site of imminent danger. Yet the portrayal of the alleged wino squatter is mitigated by Dubkin's feelings of measured kinship, as signaled most poignantly in the chapter's conclusion:</page><page sequence="14">60 ISLE It grew cold toward the end of October, and I knew that I could not come much longer to the field. . . . One day ... I was surprised to see that the blanket no longer lay on the ground. The man who had slept there at night throughout the summer had gone somewhere else. I felt a keen sense of disappointment to think that I had never seen him, never said hello to him, never asked him how he liked sleeping there. What was it like here at night, I wondered, with the stars overhead, the moon in the sky? (146) Despite never meeting and often fearing this shadowy figure, who is known to the narrator only indirectly through his meager leavings, Dubkin feels his apparent departure as a significant loss, one compar- able to (though not as ecologically significant as) the various environ- mental losses he catalogues in the book's final chapter- the alteration or eradication of his long-cherished "secret places." The invisible human presence in the meadow sharply illustrates the paradox of humanity's relationship to nature in the city. At once responsible for the developed landscape's transformation and toxification, the human species is also a threat to itself, both real and perceived: in this wilder- ness of empty lots, the most dangerous animals in the urban jungle are people. 0 Yet, Dubkin holds out the possibility of humans making positive connections- not just with the land, but with each other- and thereby suggests the humanizing influence of urban nature. Dubkin reiterates this theme in ironic fashion in the book's conclud- ing chapter, which shifts from the past to a contemporary revisiting of "the various secret places I had known, to see how they were getting along. It would be like a journey backward in time; it would be like reliving my life" (159). The results of the journey are devastating. The quiet pond teeming with birds, frogs, and snakes at the edge of the city has become the site of a housing project and town dump; Northerly Island, a vacant area ideal for observing birds and insects in isolation, is now a busy, noisy airport. Dubkin discovers to his dismay that "all my secret places . . . were polluted or built up or eroded" (172). And the empty lot he once shared with the shadowy vagrant? Nothing had been built there, nothing had been torn down. But as I looked more closely my spirits sank. The plants had died and were lying on the ground, and the little trees were bare of leaves. What could have caused this? ... I looked close to the ground, but could not see a single insect, and there were no birds there. (168)</page><page sequence="15">Empty Lots and Secret Places 61 The scene is reminiscent of the opening images of Carson's Silent Spring , a book Dubkin admired, in its chilling evocation of the death of nature. As Dubkin writes: "There had been butterflies fluttering in the air and sipping nectar from flowers, dragonflies and hornets had zoomed about, and spiders and beetles and caterpillars had moved everywhere on the ground. What could have happened to the place to cause it to become a dead world?" (169). He finds out in a most unlikely fashion. Stopping at a gas station across the street from the formerly vibrant meadow he discovered ten years before, Dubkin improbably discovers that the attendant on duty is the very same man who had slept in the empty lot ten years earlier, who relates that the railroad's program of DDT-based mosquito control had eradicated through an ecological chain reaction the plant and animal life from the patch of open space. The anecdote allows Dubkin to make the important point about the vulnerability of the eco- logical fabric to pesticides like DDT, which remain in the soil for years and have ripple effects on the biota of a landscape beyond their immediate targets. This resolution, such as it is, also implicitly com- ments on the human-nature relation in the urban landscape. The mys- terious tramp known only by the markings of his presence is originally an ambiguous yet unsettling symbol of threat to the narra- tor, a manifestation of how humanity itself creates a dangerous form of wilderness in the city. In a surprising twist, the tramp is later revealed to be a kindred spirit, one who joins the narrator in rueful regret over the chemical poisoning of the city's precious green space. In this scene, then, it's not the presence of individual humans that vio- lates nature, but rather the faceless, industrialized, chemical control of the urban environment carried on by the human social machine. Dubkin and "Chicago Wilderness" I cannot help but think about Dubkin Park- its small and humble stature, its unheralded place in an ordinary public neighborhood- when musing upon the legacy of Leonard Dubkin's life and work. There is much more to that legacy, ultimately, than that little park, fitting though it may be in its expression of the man's character and message. Dubkin created a landscape of ideas about the pleasures and possibilities of encountering nature within urban space. Just as importantly, he presaged many of the values and methods of an ambitious environmental movement currently afoot in his hometown, a phenomenon evocatively called "Chicago Wilderness" that has become a powerful force in the region's current conservation, restor- ation, planning, and environmental advocacy efforts.</page><page sequence="16">62 ISLE This seemingly oxymoronic yet catchy phrase has multiple mean- ings that resonate geographically, scientifically, politically, and philo- sophically. It refers to the variety of protected lands and natural areas within the region, as well as the biodiversity that exists within those territories; a broad-based coalition of environmental organizations, from grassroots groups to universities to museums to nonprofits, that advocate for environmental education, research, and public policy; and a general audience magazine, Chicago Wilderness , that publishes regional environmental news, nature photography, travel and recrea- tions tips, and environmental journalism. But beyond these major referents, the concept of Chicago Wilderness encompasses additional meanings. It embraces the notion of human ecology, in the dual sense that people are recognized to be not just an important component of urban ecosystems, but also an instrumental force in conserving, restoring, and (as in Dubkin's case) documenting the landscape. It provides a political and rhetorical fra- mework for doing scientific research, developing policy, fostering education and public outreach, and undertaking conservation and restoration work.11 By including a diverse array of stakeholders in these processes (scientists, politicians, educators, entrepreneurs, stu- dents, and citizen volunteers), the activity of Chicago Wilderness breaks down the barriers between professional and amateur, young and old, and city and suburb. Most importantly- and of greatest rel- evance to Dubkin's lifelong project of representing Chicago's natural history- it undercuts the false dichotomy between "city" and "nature" by redefining the wild as an inherent property of urban nature, rather than something antithetical to the city environment. This redefinition has, among other properties, a Utopian bent in its rhetorical expression of the organization's driving purpose. According to the Chicago Region Biodiversity Council's 1999 Biodiversity Recovery Plan , Chicago Wilderness aims to create the "world's first bioreserve, a metropolitan area where people live in harmony with rare and valuable nature" (6). Also telling is the rheto- ric of another document, which notes that Chicago Wilderness strives to "reconnect a landless urban population with the pulse of nature," a process in which "human communities reclaim a cultural tradition of restoring, protecting, and managing our natural communities" (Muskovits et al. 154). Both passages highlight some key themes embedded in this notion of urban wilderness. In one respect, it is a repository of biodiversity; specifically, of local (native) plants, animals, and their associated habitats. In another, the urban wilder- ness must function as a point of contact between humans and the natural landscape- wilderness thus promotes a socio-cultural benefit</page><page sequence="17">Empty Lots and Secret Places 63 to urban denizens who are otherwise "landless." In still another sense, it is implicitly acknowledged that this wilderness is not "natural," but constructed- the product of scientific management/ restoration, political protection, and artistic representation. As such, it constitutes nature that would not exist and thrive without human intervention and maintenance, actions that fundamentally are not new but rather representative of "cultural tradition."12 Dubkin Park, as one such constructed space, is neither a showcase of native flora nor an ecologically significant restoration site. It does not measurably add to the city's total acreage of open space. It's obscure to the point of absurdity, as many of the residents within even a quarter-mile radius of the park probably don't even know it's there. (I didn't.) But Dubkin Park- a kind of "secret place" in the Chicago landscape- is nevertheless a powerful testament to the importance and complex identity of urban nature. Small, commonplace, and hemmed in by urban infrastructure, Dubkin Park inspires us to think about the char- acter and future of nature in the city. Quietly, it demonstrates that the future of urban nature is coupled with that of city dwellers them- selves, folks who recognize the value of green space to their daily lives even if they can't necessarily articulate the difference between a tallgrass prairie and an oak savanna. Likewise, it is hard to think of a person more dedicated to the prop- osition of attaching value to urban nature than naturalist-writer Leonard Dubkin. Whether in the discovery of tucked away natural treasures or in the celebration of everyday nature, Dubkin's observation of urban wildlife and ecological processes were marked by scientific understanding and a humble acknowledgment of the human need for communing with the land and the creatures within it. And while he valued the benefits and pleasures of solitude and rued the careless environmental damage wrought by his fellow city dwellers, his writ- ings are evidence that the human presence is a vital part of the city landscape- and that efforts to reclaim and, in some cases, reconstruct nature in the city must take human action and desire into account. Notes 1. Emblematic of this benign neglect is Dubkin's exclusion from Carlo Rotella's otherwise excellent October Cities (1998), which devotes its first four chapters to Nelson Algren and numerous other twentieth-century Chicago writers. A notable exception is Dubkin's inclusion in two recent anthologies: Terrell Dixon's City Wilds (2002) and Joel Greenberg's Of Prairie, Woods, and Water (2008).</page><page sequence="18">64 ISLE 2.

Eiseley's letter is part of the extensive manuscript collection of Dubkin's writings- including letters, journals, newspaper columns, book reviews, book manuscripts, fiction, poetry, and unpublished manuscripts- main- tained by Pauline Dubkin Yearwood. 6. This is not to suggest that Wilson and Snyder (or Dubkin, for that matter) deny the importance of protecting and conserving large tracts of natural lands. In fact, the criticality of such large-scale conservation efforts is a key part of Wilson's argument in The Future of Life. 7. In The Machine in the Garden, a study of American pastoralism's relation to technology, Leo Marx describes this kind of scene as an archetypal moment when technology intrudes upon the meditation of the "pastoral dream" (14-5), a "metaphoric design which recurs everywhere in our literature" (16). 8. An empirical study that assesses ecosystem health in terms of the pres- ence and abundance of native plant species is Karen Glennemeier's "The State of Our Grasslands" (2006). 9. See the first chapter of John Rennie Short's Imagined Country (1991), William Cronon's essay "The Trouble with Wilderness" (1996), and the first two chapters in Roderick Nash's Wilderness and the American Mind (1967). 10. Using a version of the "social ecocriticism" advocated by Bennett as well as insights from Short, philosopher Andrew Light assesses the relation- ship between the specter of violence and the idea of "urban wilderness" in various literary and cultural representations of the city, past and present. 11. See Muskovitz et al. as well as the online publication Chicago Wilderness Journal. 12. The notion of wilderness as a cultural construct is introduced in great depth in Nash and critiqued within a more contemporary context in Cronon's "The Trouble with Wilderness." While Cronon does not develop a full-blown theory about urban wilderness here, he notes the importance of seeing the wild in "home" landscapes- whether agricultural, suburban, or urban- that are at once more familiar and less pristine.
