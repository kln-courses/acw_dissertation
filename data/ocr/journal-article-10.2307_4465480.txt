<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEW IN THE LITERATURE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT* By ISAAC EISENSTEIN BARZILAY I. Introduction THE INTEREST of the leaders of the Enlightenment in Jews and Judaism of the past far overshadowed their concern with the Jews of their own time. In their zealous struggle against old ways of life and an antiquated Weltanschauung the Jew and his culture were singled out as a main target;1 in their vision of a brighter future, he was ignored. According to the men of the Enlightenment, the Jew represented the epitome of fanaticism and religious zeal. A good example is Diderot's censure of Moses for the spirit of religious fanaticism in the world. It was because of their obstinate allegiance to the Mosaic Law and because of his belief that this allegiance was incompatible with the new spirit of the age that Diderot condemned the Jews of his time. 2 Voltaire expressed in his own sarcastic manner his readiness "to sit down at one table and share his meal with a *The period covered by the Enlightenment has been somewhat extended in this article. Though chronologically Herder and Goethe belong to early romanticism, because of the identity of their views on the contemporary Jew with those current in the literature of the Enlightenment, their inclusion in the later period was deemed justifiable.

Religious tolerance was undoubtedly one of the leading ideals of the age. With few exceptions, however, 6 its scope was restricted to Christians only. The allegiance of the Jew to his Torah cannot, however, be considered the sole reason for the attitude of the Enlightenment toward him. More basic reasons must be sought in the conditions of Jewish existence in central and western Europe during the eighteenth century. The restoration of communities of Jews in England, Prussia and France did not reflect a changed attitude toward them. Thanks to the temporary rule of the Puritans and to prevailing mercantilist policies, a small number of Jews was permitted to settle in England. These policies also explain the admission of a handful of Jews to Prussia, and the semi-official toleration extended to the Portuguese Jews in southern France. Most of the West, however, remained closed to the Jews. This was the situation in France (except in annexed Alsace-Lorraine, where severe admission restrictions remained in full force) and in the Germanies. 7 The expansion of trade and industry, however, led governments and rulers to look more favorably upon Jews with wealth and financial skill. It is significant, in this connection, that the secularized and worldly Sephardic- Portuguese element predominated in the new Jewish settlements in central and western Europe. Thus, the Jews with whom the standard bearers of the 3 Voltaire, "Tolerance," Oeuvres, XX, pp. 525-26. 4 Herder, Johann Gottfried, "Bekehrung der Juden," Herders saemtliche Werke, herausgegeben von Bernhard Suphan XXIV, (Berlin 1883), pp. 61-75. 6 D'Holbach, P.

Some also were abreast of current develop- ments in the sciences. The presence in the West of rich, worldly and, to use Herder's expression, "humanized" Jews undoubtedly heightened the urgency of solving the problem of their emancipation. When John Toland advocated Jewish naturalization in England early in the century, he was influenced mainly by the financial achievements and cultural standing of the Sephardic Jews whose participation in civic life he considered to be in the best interests of England. 8 On the other hand, the concentration of the masses of Jewry in Eastern Europe became an important factor in shaping the views of eighteenth century thinkers. As Eastern European Jews moved westward in increasingly larger numbers, fear of onrushing waves of these immigrants was reflected in various governmental enactments and in the polemical literature of the time. 9 Thus, at the end of the century, when the problem of Jewish eman- cipation became a subject of public discussion, its opponents, who were mainly Germans, emphasized the great social, psychological and even racial differences between Jews and non-Jews, which they believed unbridgeable. The Germans, closer to the habitat of the East European masses, were aware of the unique character of Jewish life and culture. Goethe's fear of Jewish emancipation may have been the result of his direct encounter with German Jews, particularly those of the Frankfurt Ghetto. 10 Consequently, attitudes 8 Cf. Picciotto, James, Sketches of Anglo-Jewish History (London 1875), p. 56 ff.; Baron, History, II, pp. 180 ff. For Toland, see Toland, Reasonsfor Naturalizing the Jews in Great Britain and Ireland on the Same Foot With all Other Nations, Containing also Defense of the Jews Against all Vulgar Prejudices in all Countries (London 1714). 9 The fear of an influx of Jews was strongly emphasized by the opponents of the "Jew Bill" of 1753 in England and in many clauses of the Lettres Patentes (1784). Cf. Hyamson, op. cit., pp. 220-21; Anchel, R., op. cit., chap. viii. "Nous sommes environnes des Juifs," was a common phrase in the Cahiers from Alsace. Some even believed "que la province contient plus de cinquante a soixante mille families Juives." Cf. Liber, M., "Les Juifs et le convocation des etats g6neraux, 1789," Revue des Etudes Juives [=REJ], LXIV [1912], pp. 92 ff., cf. also Szajkowski, Z., op. cit., pp. 28-9. Frederick II enacted many laws to restrict the Jewish population of Prussia. See Dohm, Christian Wilhelm, Ueber die buergerliche Verbesserung der Juden, I (Berlin 1781), pp. 9-22; Freund, I., op. cit., chap. ii. Throughout the 18th century there was a marked tendency to exaggerate the number of Jews. Toland wrote in 1718 "that .... the Jews .... at this day are .... more numerous than either the Spaniards (for instance) or the French." "Appendix Concerning Two Problems," in Nazarenus (London 1718). Diderot estimated the number of Jews in Amsterdam in the second half of the 18th century at more than one hundred thousand. Oeuvres, XVII, p. 432. At the end of the 17th century J. Basnage believed that "there are still near three millions of people who profess this religion" (The History of the Jews from Jesus Christ to the Present Time [= History], translated by Th. Taylor [London 1708], p. 748). Some eighty years later Abbe Henri Gregoire estimated their number at four and a half million. (Essai sur la regeneration physique, morale et politique des Juifs [Metz 1789], p. 52). Their high natural increase, he pointed out, created a problem which required immediate attention (ibid., pp. 60-66). Fear of an increased Jewish population in Germany was also displayed by some of Dohm's correspondents who emphasized "die schrecklichsten Greuel die daraus enstehen muessten" (Dohm, op. cit., pp. 145-46). 10 Describing the humanitarian spirit of the 18th century, Goethe remarked: "Die Duldsamkeit</page><page sequence="4">246 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES toward Jewish emancipation during the eighteenth century were largely determined by the geographical location of the Jews to whom attention was directed. Emancipation's apologists pointed to the great role played by Jews in the economic development of Holland, Leghorn, Prussia, etc., but their opponents pointed to the economic straitjacket allegedly imposed by the segregated Jews of eastern Europe upon their homelands, to the detriment of the native population. II. Positive Aspects of the Enlightenment Three positive aspects of the Enlightenment helped produce a new attitude toward the Jews and ultimately led to their emancipation. These were: (1) The universal-humanitarian mood of the age; (2) the mechanical inorganic theory of the state; and (3) the utilitarian point of view prevalent in the political thought of the time. The social philosophy of this age embraced the welfare of the individual as well as that of society at large. The innate equality of man was the creed of the time, and the perfectibility and happiness of the individual motivated social changes. Society at large was envisioned as constantly improving and steadily advancing to higher forms. Nations were regarded as a means toward this advancement. 12 "Our hopes as to the future condition of the human species," wrote the Marquis de Condorcet, "may be reduced to three points; the destruction of inequality between different nations, the progress of equality in one and the same nation, and lastly the real improvement of man." 13 Notwithstanding his role in the formulation of a philosophy of national- ism, 14 the deepest expression of this spirit of universal humanitarianism was given by Johann Gottfried Herder, who believed that it was the outstanding der Religionsparteien gegen einander ward nicht bloss gelehrt sondern ausgeuebt, und mit einem noch grosseren Einfluss war die buergerliche Verfassung bedroht, als man Duldsamkeit gegen die Juden .... der gutmuethigen Zeit anzuempfehlen bemueht war" (Dichtung und Wahrheit, in Goethes Werke, 55 vols., XXVIII [Weimar 1887-1918], p. 190). On another occasion, Goethe opposed Jewish emancipation on religious grounds: "In diesem Sinne, den man vielleicht pedantisch nennen mag, aber doch als folgenrecht anerkennen muss, dulden wir keinen Juden unter uns, denn wie sollten wir ihm den Antheil an der hoechsten Kultur vergoennen, deren Ursprung und Herkommen er verlaeugnet" (Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre, in Werke, XXV, p. 210).

To him humanitarianism was the development in the course of time of the best innate qualities in man, a process governed by the same natural laws as the whole universe. "One and the same law," he wrote in his Ideen, "rules the whole universe, beginning with the various systems of suns and ending with the tiniest actions of man." 16 In the universe as a whole, Herder per- ceived a tendency toward ever greater harmony so that destructive elements were gradually subdued. Likewise, he believed that in human history, the innate goodness of man steadily reduced destructive elements so that "ac- cording to the laws of their inner nature, the rule of reason among human beings must constantly expand and promote an enduring humanitarianism." He believed the progress of the human race was assured with the mere passage of time. 16 That the lofty humanism of the age strongly influenced its political thought and directly promoted Jewish emancipation, is indicated by two lesser known works of the period. The first is A Letter to the Right Honourable Sir Thomas Chitty, Lord Mayor of London, by an "anonymous merchant of London," written in connection with the heated debate about the Jew Bill of 1753.17 The second is Abb6 Gregoire's prize essay written in 1786-87 on the subject posed by the Academy of Metz: "How to make the Jews more useful and more happy in France."'8 The Letter was a plea, chiefly on utilitarian grounds, for a more liberal policy of immigration into England, including the free admission of non-Christians, Mohammedans, and espe- cially Jews. However, the universal-cosmopolitan point of view was not overlooked. In our conception of man we should always accustom ourselves to look on the human race, however scattered and dispersed, as one and the same grand republic of which God is the common father, amongst which equity, generosity and humanity ought ever to prevail. Each .country should not be considered as independent of others, but the human race - as one indivisible one - we should not be limited to the love of our countries only, or the love of the Protestants only - this is a narrow, selfish and contracted principle. The Englishman's heart should be more enlarged by an universal friendship and confidence between man and man and between nation and nation.19 The supernational concept of the state was upheld by Gregoire in his Essai. In reply to Michaelis' assertion that Jews could by no means acquire patriotic virtues, 20 Gregoire wrote: Demagogues have forever extolled the loyalty of subjects to their native land and sovereign. Actually, one only needs to observe people in various countries to realize that the real motiva- 16 Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit [=Ideen] (Leipzig 1812), p. 248. 16 Ibid., pp. 246-48. 17 A Letter to the Right Honourable Sir Thomas Chitty, Lord Mayor of London [ =A Letter] (London 1760). 18 Gregoire, Henri, Essai sur la regeneration physique, morale et politique des Juifs (Metz 1789). 19 A Letter ..., p. 55.

As long as they dwell in their homes securely and enjoy the fruits of their labor in peace without being crushed by taxation or despotism, they are content. Beyond these considerations, the government and sovereign are none of their concern. True, they may be familiar with the word 'patriotism' but it connotes nothing to them.21 Like Locke and Tindal22 almost a century earlier, Gregoire did not put any emphasis on the emotional element in the relation of the individual to the state, an element that was to come to the foreground with the rise of nationalism. Hence he was convinced that, once emancipated, the Jews "will become attached to the state by ties of pleasure, security, liberty and a life of ease." 23 With the exception of Rousseau, 24 the state, almost to the eve of the French Revolution, was thought of as a technical and mechanical rather than organic unity, resulting chiefly from mutual interests and needs. To Locke, the commonwealth was merely "a society of men constituted for the procuring, preserving and advancing of their own civil interests." 25 With the spiritual interests and needs of the individual the state as such had nothing to do. They were deemed the concern of the individual alone. "The care of everyman's soul belongs unto himself and is to be left unto himself." 26 The state was thus considered a mere instrument its inhabitants maintained to safeguard their natural rights. The logical implication of such a view was primarily to deny the ruler the power of imposing any dogma on the people. The idea of a Christian state, Locke and Tindal asserted, not only contradicts the Gospel but the basic idea of the state itself. In short: "There is absolutely no such thing as a Christian Commonwealth." 27 The practical application of this theory required the separation of church and state, the exercise of tolerance and the grant of civil rights to members of all denominations. "Neither pagan, nor Mohammedan, nor Jew ought to be excluded from the civil rights of the Commonwealth because of his religion." 28 To the cosmopolitan humanitarianism of the eighteenth century and the prevailing concept of the supernational character of the state, a third factor must be added, namely, the utilitarian point of view. During the Enlightenment the functional nature of truth in science, religion and met- aphysics was strongly emphasized. 29 This criterion of utility prevailed also in 21 Gregoire, op. cit., p. 109. 22 Tindal, Matthew, An Essay Concerning the Power of the Magistrate and the Rights of Mankind in Matter of Religion (London 1679).

Since the state was considered necessary to the individual for the pursuit of his welfare and happiness, its development became a primary aim. Agriculture was held in the highest esteem and believed to constitute the basis for a country's strength and riches; 30 however, the vital role of commerce and industry was gradually understood. In connection with this more balanced view arose a new principle which emphasized the direct relationship between the welfare of a state and the size of its population. Throughout the literature of the eighteenth century this doctrine repeatedly stressed that the greatest asset of a state was a large population. Every workingman is a real source of riches and power. "We all know," wrote John Toland in 1714, "that numbers of people are the true riches and powers of any country." 31 Hence the plea of the anonymous merchant of London for a more liberal policy of immigration to England. "The real strength, power and riches of all kingdoms of the world," he wrote, "will depend on the number of inhabitants, and on that only .... all countries thinly populated must and ever will be poor ... it is the number of inhabitants only that can render a place great and powerful." 32 This argument was further elaborated in the early eighties of the eighteenth century by Dohm,33 and later by Gregoire34 and Mirabeau,35 for central and western Europe then experienced a manpower shortage. The territorial expansion of England and France on the other side of the Atlantic and in the Indies, and the imperial wars in which they became involved, were a great drain on their populations. Men were needed to man the ships, to fight the wars and to increase agricultural and industrial output. Further- more, the relative peace that prevailed in the western part of the continent during most of the century, coupled with the progress of science and technology, turned men's minds to economic expansion and growth. The more liberal policies toward the Jews, which became apparent in Europe at this time, tied in with the current stress upon the vital importance of increasing the population to meet the needs of the ever expanding economy. Hence statesmen and intellectuals urged the removal of all restrictions from the Jewish population and the admission of new Jewish settlers. Jewish 30 See, for instance, Dohm, op. cit. II, p. 155: "Auch ich halte es fuer eine ausgemachte Wahrheit, dass der Staat nur aus denen bestehe, welche das Eigenthum des Landes, in dem er errichtet ist, besitzen oder Rechte an dasselbe erworben haben. Land ist das sicherste und dauernste Eigenthum, daher erscheinen dessen Besitzer vorzueglich als die wichtigsten, ersten und bleibendsten Buerger."

"They are disseminated," Joseph Addison wrote of them in 1712, "through all the trading parts of the world, that they are become the instruments by which mankind are knit together by a general correspondence. They are the pegs and nails in a great building, which, though they are but little valued in themselves, are absolutely necessary to keep the whole frame together." 37 To Toland they were the "brokers of the world," who "whithersoever they come, create business as well as manage it." 38 Montesquieu reiterated this opinion almost verbatim. "Throughout the world," he wrote, "wherever there is money there are Jews." 3 9 To the Jews of the Middle Ages Montes- quieu credited the invention of the Bill of Exchange as a means of safeguard- ing their effects in face of the constant threat of expulsion.40 This great service of the Jews to international trade was also acknowledged by Gregoire, who, with specific reference to France, added that "it is again to the Jews that we are indebted for the establishment of the banks at Bayonne and Bordeaux." 41 The great importance the French government attached to the economic activities of the Jews in southern France during the first half of the eighteenth century was well indicated in the reply of Cardinal Fleury to the merchants of Bordeaux, who had requested the abrogation of the privileges of the Jews in that town. "We rather wish," the Cardinal answered them, "they could be indulged with more and larger privileges, that thereby greater numbers might be invited to leave other countries and settle in France with their families and effects." 42 Even Diderot, who was by no means friendly toward the Jews, remarked in his Voyage de Hollande (1733), that "the Jewish refugees in Holland, by their example, taught the Dutch to form establish- ments along the coast of Berbery and the Levant." 43 In this context mention may be made of the warm reception given by government officials in Messina to the group headed by Rabbi Iayyim Ibn 'Attar on their way to Palestine in 1740.44 In the same year the Jews were officially invited to settle in Naples. 45 Historical confirmation was abundant that the Jews were an important s6 Toland, op. cit., pp. 13-14; Dohm, op. cit., p. 93. a7 Spectator, no. 495, quoted in A Letter, Appendix, p. 5. 38 Toland, op. cit., p. 14. 39 Lettres Persanes, Texte etabli et present6 par hlie Carcasonne (Paris 1929), Lettre Ix. 40 Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws, op. cit., I. pp. 364-65. 41 Gregoire, op. cit., p. 83. 42 A Lettre, pp. 43-44. 4 Oeuvres, XVII, p. 397. 44 Cf., Mann, Jacob, "Massa'am shel Rabbi Hayyim Ibn 'Attar va-Havurato le-Ere;.

The decline of Spain and Portugal followed the expulsion of the Jews, the persecution of the Marranos and the expulsion of the Moors, while the flourishing of "the paltry fisher-town of Leghorn," Holland, England and Prussia seemed, to some extent at least, attributable to an opposite policy. These facts were repeatedly pointed out as clear proof of the high value of the Jew in a country's economic life. 46 III. Negative Aspects of the Enlightenment The Enlightenment itself was a movement restricted to a small fraction of the European people. Its ideas and aspirations were the possession of the intellectual elite alone. But even among them ill-will toward the Jew was far more common than goodwill. The masses of the people in the villages and towns held tenaciously to their deep-seated hostility to the Jews. This was clear from their behavior in the assemblies which followed the passing of the Jew Bill of 1753.47 Some thirty-five years later in France, during the local assemblies that preceded the convocation of the National Assembly, the masses instructed their delegates to extend the restrictive regulations of 1784 to bar the Jews from gaining power and increasing their numbers; to put an end to their exploitation of the peasants or to expel them from the country. 48 These urban masses throughout the century filled to capacity the newly established playhouses and acclaimed with enthusiasm any play in which the character of "a stupid ... avaricious ... cowardly ... villainous ... foppish ... boastful ... amorous ... and licentious" Jew was presented. 49 Rarely did the writers of fiction and drama during the age of Enlightenment present a benevolent and human Jew. The few plays in England that did give favorable portrayals of the Jew met with failure.5 ? A similar situation also prevailed in Germany, where Gellert's benevolent Jew51 remained for a long time a solitary figure, imitated perhaps only by Lessing's traveler in his Juden (1749).52 46 Toland, op. cit., pp. 6, 42; A Letter, pp. 43, 63-64; also, Appendix, p. 4; Montesquieu, Lettres Persanes, Lettre Ix. 47 "Such an abominable spirit is raging against them," wrote Thomas Herring, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1753, "that I expect in a little time they will be massacred."

In one of his "humanitarian" statements on the Jews, Voltaire suggested that they should not be burned.53 Rousseau demanded toleration for "all religions that tolerate others as long as their dogmas contain nothing contrary to the duties of citizenship." 54 Toleration of the Jews on utilitarian and humanitarian grounds was also urged by Motesquieu, who pointed out the negative economic results of intolerance. 55 Herder also expressed his dis- satisfaction with intolerance, which produced degrading and inhuman measures against the Jews. 56 Goethe too prayed for the day when mutual tolerance would prevail and wipe out prejudice and hate. 57 All this, however, was mere lip service. The idea of emancipation did not occur to any of these writers. Even the anonymous Letter, which pleaded for an increased immigra- tion of Jews into England and their naturalization, made it quite explicit that "in all respects relating to trade," they should be put "on the same footing as the old inhabitants," but in no other way. "That none of them be permitted to be of His Majesty's privy council or a member of either house of parliament, or to hold any office or place of trust either civil or military under the government - all these should be reserved for the old inhab- itants." 58 The plea of some of the Enlightened for a more liberal attitude toward the Jews reflected, in most cases, a regard for a principle rather than an actual change of heart toward them. The age of Enlightenment was one in which deep-seated emotions and attitudes were often swept aside in the name of the lofty principles of reason. In its desire to inaugurate a new era in the history of mankind, the En- lightenment could not, without violating its own principles, ignore the Jews completely. The emergence of a new attitude toward them clearly marked a victory of reason over passion and prejudice, but this victory was never complete. In the final analysis, reason and emotions were still irreconcilable. Even devoted friends of the Jews such as Dohm, Mirabeau and Gregoire made it clear that theirs was merely a plea for a new experiment in a new historical setting; an experiment whose success or failure depended on the Jews to an even greater extent than on the Christians. They took this liberal stand in the hope that, as a result, a new type of Jew would emrgee, ready to abandon his Jewishness for the sake of becoming integrated in society.

They all considered him degraded and his role in society perni- cious. Ill-will toward him was displayed by all, even by his friends. IV. Jewish Uniqueness - the Cause of Enmity This almost universal, negative attitude toward the eighteenth century Jew needs further scrutiny. Its main source must be sought in the basic fact that the Jews, in spite of their having been Europeans for so many centuries, were still considered, even by themselves, to be utter strangers. "The Jews," wrote Gregoire in his prize essay, "are scattered everywhere, they have struck roots, however, nowhere.... In London he is not an Englishman, nor is he Dutch at the Hague, nor French in Metz. They are a state within a state." 59 They were strangers in many ways. Culturally, most of them had been living in utter isolation from the rest of European society; economically, their occupations were generally concentrated in trade and finance. Their religion and national hopes further widened the gulf between them and Christian society. Cultural Isolation Jewish culture, generally identified with the Talmud as interpreted by the rabbis, was held in contempt by current writers. The Talmud itself was inaccessible to most Christian theologians and scholars of the age. Their opinions on it were based mainly on Eisenmenger's Entdecktes Judenthum, which was largely drawn from the polemics of Jewish converts of Christian Spain. Another source was the history of Basnage from which Diderot copied his article "Les Juifs" for the Encyclopedia. 60 Michaelis, though aware of the unreliability of Eisenmenger, praised his book and consulted it frequently. 61 No matter what sources were consulted, the picture of the Jews and Judaism was greatly distorted. They sought a counterpart to Christian theology in Judaism, and made the Aggadah their main source of reference. The uncouth imagery frequently encountered in some of the Aggadoth and Midrashim was taken out of context, and what was only a product of the popular mind, became the foundation on which a "Philosophy of Judaism" was erected. The variety of legends woven around such Biblical stories as the Creation, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, angels and heroes, was thus turned into a source for the portrayal of Jewish "creeds" which were presented as the 69 Gregoire, op. cit., p. 110. 6 o Compare, for instance, Diderot's opinion on the Talmud and the rabbis with that of Basnage. See "Jugement sur le Talmud," in "Juifs," Oeuvres, XV, pp. 362-68 and Basnage, "The Gemarists and Talmudists," op. cit., pp. 170 ff. 61 Dohm, op. cit., II, pp. 38-41.</page><page sequence="12">254 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES essence of the Jew's Weltanschauung. 62 Though a monotheism, Judaism was characterized as anthropomorphic in its concept of God,63 pervaded with belief in demons, spirits, 64 and talismans, 65 and a most fanatic and hate- laden religion. It was chiefly the Talmud and the rabbinical interpretations which these writers believed taught Jews to harbor contempt and hate toward Christians and Christianity: 66 "to steal the goods of Christians, to regard them as savage beasts, to push them in a precipice .... to kill them with impunity and to utter every morning the most horrible imprecations against them." 67 While the voluminousness and inaccessibility of the Talmud at times evoked awe and admiration among Christians,68 contempt for the rabbis was general and their abuse a common feature in the writings of the age. "One can hardly find two among them," wrote Montesquieu who knew so little of them, "who have the least common sense." 69 In the opinion of Gregoire, they were fanatic, narrow and ignorant, and were to blame for the low cultural and moral state of the Jews. "Instead of expanding the horizons of the human spirit, they have consecrated its errors and declared as dogmas the false offspring of a delirious imagination." 70 He thought it a good idea to present Jewish customs and ceremonies in a ridiculous light in an attempt to weaken the hold of rabbinism. 71 Dohm attributed "the extreme inclination of the people for the abstract, their love for usury, cheating," and many "of their other faults," to the casuistry of the rabbis. 72 Goethe greatly enjoyed the caricature of a rabbi presented by Wilhelm Meister: Nobody ever portrayed the caricature of a rabbi better than he. The fanatic zeal, the repulsive enthusiasm, the wild gesticulations, the confused murmuring, the piercing outcries, the effeminate movements, the sudden ups and downs of exaltation and the queerness of an ancient nonsense - all these he grasped so acutely that the presentation of this distasteful scene could make happy every man of taste as long as it lasted. 73 Another aspect of rabbinical Judaism which was sharply censured in Enlightenment literature, as evidence of Jewish separateness, was the use of Yiddish. In the sixth letter of his reply "to some objections" raised by "Jewish correspondents," Voltaire begged them not to reproach him for having little love for them. 62 Cf. mainly Basnage, op. cit., Books II, III; Diderot, Oeuvres, XV, pp. 362 ff. 63 Op. cit., XV, pp. 378-81. 64 Ibid., pp. 386 ff. 65 Montesquieu, Lettres Persanes, Lettre cxliii. 66 Basnage, op. cit., p. 468. 67 Diderot, Oeuvres, XV, p. 365. 68 Ibid., p. 366. 69 Melanges inedits, publies par le baron de Montesquieu (Bordeaux 1892), p. 140. 70 Gregoire, op. cit., p. 173. 71 Ibid., p. 187. 72 Dohm, op. cit., I, p. 97. 73 Goethe, Werke, LII, pp. 267-68.</page><page sequence="13">The Jew in Enlightenment Literature 255 I love you so much that I would like you all to be in Jerusalem in place of the Turks who are devastating your country. There, you will cultivate this unfortunate desert as you did before .... you will be able to transform your territory as the Provencales have transformed theirs. There, you will carry on at ease and repose your detestable chant in your detestable Jargon.7 4 Among the first clauses of the Toleranz Patent of Joseph II of Austria of the year 1781, was "the removal of their national language from usage in con- tracts, bills, commercial books, documents, with the only exception of the prayerbook." 75 A few years later, this example was emulated by Louis XVI in his Lettres Patentes of July 10, 1784.76 Gregoire also looked forward to the day, when "this kind of dialect, the German-Hebrew-Rabbinical Jargon, which is current among German Jews and understood only by them, will be extirpated.... This dialect is used only to spread ignorance or to conceal their knavery." 77 "There is something pathetic in the Judensprache," Goethe observed; 7 8 he described it, however, as naseweises Nestquaeckelchen79 and considered it the vehicle of a fanatic and anti-Christian rabbinism.80 The anti-"Jargon" campaign of the Berlin Maskilim8' may thus be traced, to some extent at least, to the influence of the European Enlightenment. Views on Economic Pursuits Even such staunch supporters of the Jews as Toland, Dohm, Gregoire and Mirabeau, though acknowledging their financial abilities and impor- tance, could not altogether ignore the prevalent opinion thatJewish economic dealings were essentially unproductive. As long as the economic behavior of the Jews remained unchanged, Gregoire contended, a more liberal policy toward Jewish immigration was unjustifiable despite the desperate shortage of manpower in western and central Europe.82 Herder also believed that it was in the interest of the states concerned to restrain the economic activities of the Jews. 3 Should the English Naturalization Bill pass, its opponents argued, the Jews "would deluge the country with brokers, usurers and beggars .... the rich Jews would purchase lands .... and thus influence the constitution of the Church.... They would rob the natives of their birthright .... disgrace 74 Voltaire, Oeuvres, XIX, pp. 528-29. 76 Pribram, Alfred Francis, Urkunden zur Geschichte der Juden in Wien, I (Wien und Leipzig 1918), pp. 440-43.

They would acquire so much wealth and consequently also power .... that Judaism would become the fashionable religion of the land." 84 The allegedly pernicious results of the financial dealings of the Jews were also emphasized in the Cahiers de doleance from Alsace-Lorraine and in the anti-Jewish campaign launched during the first year of the Revolution.85 Were the Jews to be emancipated, their opponents in the Germanies objected, they would buy all the land, dispossess the Germans, and in the course of a few generations become the sole masters of the country. 8 6 A similar opinion was held by Herder who stated that emancipation of the Jews would result in their gaining full control of German economic life, "with the landowners the Canaanites, serving them as manufacturers."87 Except for his regard for the Bible as a great cultural monument, Herder's views on the Jews were generally as negative as those of Voltaire. Like Voltaire, he also considered Jewish proclivities to usury and brokerage an innate trait traceable to Biblical times. "For thousands of years," he wrote, "since their emergence on the stage of history, the Jews were a parasitic growth on the stem of other nations, a race of cunning brokers all over the earth. They have caused great evil to many ill-organized states, by retarding the free and natural economic development of their indigenous population." 8 8 The example of Holland, he further argued, should not be followed by such European nations as Poland, Germany, Hungary, Italy and France, since none of these lands is or "can be an Amsterdam." 89 Goethe regarded the Jews as nomads, constantly at war with sedentary European society and living off the spoils. Though impressed by their agility, mobility, agressiveness and stubborn persistence, he ascribed these attributes to the Jewish drive "to grab the purse (Beutel)" of non-Jews. Their economic dealings were responsible for qualities distinguishing them from other Eu- ropeans. Thus, as a people, they were far more vivacious, energetic and dynamic than others. 90 Similar observations, with a clear racial undertone, are found in preacher Schwager's notes on Dohm's book. Their vivaciousness is much greater than ours.... Their manners and customs are so different from ours that it is hard to conceive that they could change to such an extent that they would integrate in our society.... Their temperament is suitable perhaps for a commercial state; 84 Hyamson, op. cit., pp. 220-21. 85 Liber, M., op. cit., pp. 194 ff.; see also Dubnow, op. cit., VIII, chap. i. 86 Dohm, op. cit., II, p. 46; see also Schwager's notes to Dohm, ibid., pp. 89-111. 87 Herder, Werke, XXIV, p. 74. 88 Herder, "Hebraeer," in Ideen, 2nd ed.

A quiet, retired and sedentary life seems hardly suitable for their fiery nature. Schwager concludes with the following racist note: "By his hair and physiognomy the Jew clearly shows how great the difference is between him and us .... no less is also the spiritual distance that separates us." 9 The Jews' Alleged Immorality The indictment of the Jews on economic grounds was usually accompanied by a moral indictment. From Basnage to Dohm, in drama, novels and polemical pamphlets, the same charges of cheating, stealing, robbing, extor- tion, etc., were levelled against them. Eisenmenger in his Entdecktes Judenthum and Voltaire were most responsible for spreading these charges. Many other authors of the eighteenth century also displayed a marked tendency to hurl abuse at the Jews. In fiction the Jew was treated as illiberally as in drama. It is sufficient to mention Pope's scathing satire on Edmund Curll, Defoe's odious Israelite in Roxana, the licentious Jews in Smollett's early novels, Richardson's Jewish libertine in Sir Charles Grandison and Fanny Burney's money lenders in Cecilia.92 The low opinion of the morality of the Jews among all classes in the Germanies can be observed in Lessing's Juden,93 and later in the remarks of Dohm's correspondents. 94 Incidental references to Jews were less frequent in the drama and fiction of France than in the same forms in England and Germany,95 but this omission was compensated in the more serious writings of the Enlightenment. Diderot deserves at least some mention here because of his derogatory allusions to Jews in his Le neveu de Rameau and Voyage de Hollande. 96 Besides attributing to Jews ruthless usury, greediness for money and hatred for Christians, the writers of the eighteenth century added to the catalogue of 9' Dohm, op. cit., II, pp. 98-100. 92 Van der Veen, op. cit., pp. 266-67. 93 Lessing, Gotthold Ephraim, Saemtliche Schriften, ed.

One finds in Rameau two more references to the Jew of the time. In one of them Rameau tells a strange story: how a Jew was cheated of his money by a "renegade of Avignon" and burned by the Inquisition (Ibid., p. 296). In the other Diderot introduces a sexually dissolute Jew. In Voyage De Hollande, Diderot divides the Jews of Amsterdam into "shaven" and "bearded." About the latter he remarks: "II faut se tenir sur ses gardes avec les barbus, qui ne sont pas infiniment scrupuleux," Oeuvres, XVII, p. 432. In Lessing's Juden, the two robbers who attacked the traveller considered it best to disguise their identity by putting on Jewish-looking beards.</page><page sequence="16">258 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES vices cowardice and sexual dissoluteness. Not only were they described as designers on the purse of the Gentiles, but also on the virtue and innocence of Christian women.9 7 "Zionist" Tendencies Another criticism of the Jews during the eighteenth century was based on their national hope of returning to Zion. If we may judge from the references to this subject in the writings of the age, these national aspirations were widely diffused among the Jews of the time and exerted great influence upon them. Such was the observation of Basnage,98 Toland,99 David Hartley, 100 Diderot, 10 Voltaire, 02 Herder, 103 and Michaelis. 104 More remarkable, however, is the fact that these hopes were shared by many Christians of the time. This was the case particularly in England, where they originated in a humanitarian and religious mysticism.105 Among the first to give expression to those hopes was Toland. In a small pamphlet, written in 1718, he praised the Mosaic Law, and asserted that such a law would have made a "government immortal" had it ever been fully implemented. He further noted that "the Jews continue still a distinct people from all other, both as to their race and religion." The conclusion he drew was: that, as the Jews known at this day, and who are dispersed over Europe, Asia and Africa, with some few in America, are found by good calculation to be more numerous than either the Spaniards (for example) or the French: so if they ever happen to be resettled in Palestine upon their original foundation, which is not at all impossible, they will then, by reason of their excellent constitution be much more populous, rich and powerful than any other nation now in the world. I would have you consider whether it be not both the interest and duty of Chris- tians to assist them in regaining their country, o6 In support of his belief in the future restoration of the Jews, Hartley cited: the preservation of the Jewish people with their distinct way of life in spite of oppression and persecution; their adherence to Hebrew as "an 97 Basnage pointed out that one of the causes of Christian hatred of the Jews was their moral looseness: "They love," he wrote, "fair women though they be Christians.... They are as fond of money as beauty" (History, Book VI, p. 467). This accusation recurs frequently in the literature of the eighteenth century. Cf.

"A period of time," he wrote, "will come when this people shall be restored and reestablished in their own land and country, and enjoy a degree of dominion and power, more potent and considerable than any other kingdom or nation in the world." 108 Those who were ardent believers in the future restoration of the Jews also pleaded for their admission into England as naturalized citizens. Jewish national aspirations did not appear to these Gentiles to conflict with their partial emancipation. A friendlier attitude to Jews was advocated precisely because of this anticipated restoration. 109 The regular principles of secular politics, these writers implied, should not be applied to the Jews in whose past history they perceived the guiding hand of Providence. On the Continent, the attitude toward Jewish national aspirations was different. Even before the Revolution, the concept of the nationalist state was gaining acceptance. I10 When Dohm ventilated the problem of Jewish emancipation in the early eighties, it was on nationalist grounds that opposi- tion developed. How can the Jews, argued Michaelis, demand civil rights when they still cherish and revere their Mosaic Law and hope to return to Palestine? 1' Even Dohm and Gregoire could not ignore this argument; however, they did not attach too much importance to Jewish national hopes. Recalling Mendelssohn's view on this problem, 12 Dohm pointed out that these hopes were rather of a spiritual-mystical nature and basically no different from the Christians belief in the Second Coming. "3 Gregoire reiterated Mendelssohn's view on the expected return to Palestine: In times of suffering, when misfortune weighs heavily on the Jew, when trembling he eats his bread of affliction, he sighs perhaps for the Messiah.... His coming, however, would be less welcome to our Israelite if the humaneness of the people would allow him to breathe in peace and live happily in his home ... Very often do the advantages of the present life make one forget the promises of the future. In his senses, the Jew is not in any way different from us. 107 Observations, pp. 386-87. 108 A Letter, Appendix, p. 48. 109 Ibid., p. 39. 110 Cf.

National aspirations were incompatible with the demand for political rights and indicative of Jewish separatism. Palestine, he remarked somewhat facetiously, was too small a country for such an active and energetic people as the Jews. They would be willing to return there only if, along with the country, they received the whole Mittelhandel of the old and new world. 115 The destiny of the Jews, he concluded, lay in Christian Europe and hence but one course was open to them: complete adjustment to it, difficult as the experience might prove for both sides. Herder expressed this thought in a metaphor borrowed from the rabbis: Weeping, Esau and Israel cling to each other. The kiss is painful to both of them; they cannot, however, tear themselves apart. 11 V. Conclusion The age of the Enlightenment marks the beginning of a new era in Jewish-Christian relations. Against the background of an emerging belief in the equality of man and the importance of education and environment as forces molding the individual, a new attempt was made to analyze the underlying causes of the centuries-old hatred of the Jew as well as to under- stand the Jew of the time and his unique way of life. 117 Social thinkers, for the first time, examined the Christian world to seek an explanation of the genesis of the Jewish problem. It was Christian Europe, in whose soil the Jewish personality had long been nurtured, that was held responsible for negative characteristics attributed to the Jew. Such char- acteristics were regarded not as innate but as the natural result of historical circumstances. The conviction was expressed that under different circum- stances, the Jewish personality would necessarily be altered. 118 The "liberals," among whom were Dohm, Gregoire and Mirabeau, 114 Gregoire, op. cit., pp. 111-12. 115 Herder, Werke, XXIV, pp. 66-67. 1l6 Ibid., p. 67. 117 For Germany, cf.

The "liberals" were opposed by Michaelis, Schwager and other "cor- respondents" of Dohm in the Germanies, as well as by the reactionary group in the National Assembly of France. Citing the cultural isolation of the Jew, his adherence to his religion, customs and traditions, in face of many hard- ships and persecutions, they declared that the Jews were an exception to the rule that human nature was subject to change. 119 A third view was supported by Voltaire, Herder and Goethe, among others. While opposing the emancipation of the Jew on the ground that it would constitute a grave danger to the buergerliche Verfassung 20 and under- mine the national economy,l21 these men expressed their belief in the ultimate integration of the Jew in civil society. They regarded reforms within Jewry, along social, cultural and economic lines, as prerequisites for such an integration. Only then would the Jews become "equal partners .... in the common culture of humanity." 122 This view, which may be termed condi- tional emancipation, was for all practical purposes meaningless. The ideals of reason, humanitarianism and tolerance won. Governments began to institute more liberal policies toward the Jews, and the Jews of Western Europe, in turn, to modify their way of life in harmony with the Zeitgeist of the eighteenth century. 119 Cf.
