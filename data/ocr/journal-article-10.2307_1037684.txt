If still another reviewer may borrow Isaiah Berlin's popular metaphor, we may liken Professor Etzioni to the fox who knows many things and is interested in all of them. He has scurried through the rec- ord of our times, and its countless interpre- tations, as his footnotes amply testify. At some point in his prowling he came upon a concept worthy to be the one big thing known by a hedgehog. The big thing has been turned into a big book. The handi- work is still the fox's. We are offered, along with many other enlightenments, es- says on macro-sociology, an exposition of the languages of societal analysis, some re- flections on power and alienation, and an imposing statement on inauthenticity. The industrious fox allows us a glimpse of The Active Society from time to time, and we see that it might be a big thing, but we cannot be quite sure what it is. Maybe it is a vision of an inevitable future, maybe it is a happy option which an enlightened people might choose among other available goals. In the flicker of our present bewil- derments it is more likely to remain a concept on a social science blackboard. Written in the forbidding vernacular of the social science theorist, The Active Society is a book not likely to be opened by ac- tivists. Nevertheless, The Active Society is a big thing which deserves a better introduction to a world in varying stages of despair. Occasionally imparting conviction, it states the case for optimism, and offers directions to a self-renewing Utopia. As it stands, the book deserves attention and transla- tion into terms which movers and shakers can use. Support for optimism about human affairs is hard to find in our age of alarm. Etzioni's idea of The Active Society emerges from a two by two classification matrix in which the variables of social control and consensus-building mechanisms are matched in maximum and minimum values for each. These two variables are the components of what the author insists on calling "societal guidance." It becomes possible to derive four forms of societal guidance for our consideration. There is the passive society, as found in the unde- veloped nations, low on both control and consensus-building. The overmanaged so- ciety, high in control, low in consensus- building is, of course, the totalitarian state. Reversing the values for the two com- ponents of guidance, we obtain the drifting society, mobilized only in extreme crises, as in the large and established democracies of the West. This leaves a fourth cell, a little like the blanks we used to see on Mendeleyev's Periodic Table of the Ele- ments, a challenge for synthesis. High in control, high in consensus-building mecha-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK DEPARTMENT 223 nisms, it is a vacant cell, although the au- thor thinks that Scandinavia and Israel come close to filling it. Unfortunately, he draws little from the examples of either to animate his text. The cell is still vacant, still a goal which societies might choose and attain. It is The Active Society. Etzioni labors long and hard at the con- struction of a theory of societal self-control. The mental picture remaining with the reader at the end of his own labors is that of an encrmous and unmanageable dia- gram in which the sweating, shouting, muddle-headed nature of the human race is circumscribed in cells with which soci- etal guidance can deal. Thus Etzioni's in- teresting ideas about compliance structures are brought forth as clues for the social engineer in regard to how the shouts of the alienated can be transformed into the zeal of the committed. It is useful to be shown that the response to coercion is alienation, whereas the response to normative control is commitment. But in a vast, pluralistic society, with fiercely competing norms, co- ercion is seen by many as the only means to social survival. It is significant that the examples of The Active Society, which Etzi- oni offers, come from Israel and Sweden, not from the United States, Russia, Great Britain or France. Early in the context, we learn that The Active Society "knows itself, is committed to moving toward a fuller realization of its values, . . . commands the levers that such transformation required, and is able to set limits on its capacity for self-alteration-- lest it become self-mutilation." It is the at- tribution of a capacity for knowing, com- mitting, and commanding to a society which accounts for Etzioni's inability to convey a believable picture of his pragmatic Utopia. For in these latter sixties, how can we think of societies as entities which know, commit, and command? It is not enough to argue, as Etzioni seems to do, that when consensus is fully built all members of a society know together. Even in the most highly educated societies, consensus is not built by individual knowing decisions by each member. Surely anthropomorphism should be as obsolete in macro-sociology as it is in theology. If Etzioni, as a hedgehog, verges on the socially mystical, in his role as a fox he is more rigorous. Explicit statements are made in the first pages about the nature of the society toward which he would lead us. He accepts the technology of the age, rec- ognizes its meance to freedom, and sees The Active Society as one which keeps technol- ogy in its place as a servant to man rather than as his savior. He scorns the neo- anarchists who would fragment society into tribes in the hope that by ridding us of controls we would be freed from oppres- sion. What he seeks is a responsive soci- ety, one in which leadership anticipates and responds to the aspirations and values of the community. The responsive society measures its success by the reduction of inauthenticity, the condition in which the appearance of responsiveness by societal leadership belies indifference and thereby produces alienation. Macro-sociology is an unlovely term for an apparatus of exciting ideas and knowl- edge. By its application, the tasks of achieving responsiveness and reducing ali- enation can be brought into conceptual be- ing. In Etzioni's hands, macro-sociology is well equipped for the production of flow- charts and block diagrams for societal guidance. It remains to be seen whether either concepts or diagrams will suffice to counteract bureaucratic man's propensity for converting means into ends. This ig- noble alchemy has blighted many a more modest scheme. Etzioni's diagrams are made for soaring, but office-bound flesh, and blood is prone to fatigue. This reviewer also wonders faint-heart- edly whether the blank cell in that matrix of societal guidance is blank for good rea- sons. Perhaps in the nature of man high control and effective mechanisms of con- sensus-building are compatible only briefly, and only in crisis situations of the utmost gravity. If this ephemeral achievement is all that can be expected of The Active So- ciety we still have much to gain in trying for it. To build consensus through building responsiveness will surely reduce conflict from its present level of screaming con- frontation. Those of us who can still contemplate a future with greater satisfactions for more people will be grateful to Professor Etzioni</page><page sequence="3">224 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY for what he has done with the notions of responsiveness, inauthenticity, and aliena- tion. If he could transform these notions into a schedule for action, there will be many-including this reviewer-who will wish to join him in a rational flight from the chaos with which so many other social critics threaten us so convincingly.
