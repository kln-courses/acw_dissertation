<plain_text><page sequence="1">Modern Theology and the Heart of Christ Gerard O'Hanlon The story goes that a Redemptorist editor of the magazine Reality, on enquiring once of an old woman in the West of Ireland why she was switching her allegiance to the Messenger, was met with the reply 'Sure I can pray at least to the Sacred Heart, it's very hard to pray to Reality' ! The story indicates something of the widespread popularity which devotion to the Sacred Heart has enjoyed traditionally in Ireland, as indeed elsewhere in the world. It may also give us pause to consider some of the reasons for the difficulties which attend the devotion at present. In what follows I propose to outline some ways in which modern theology offers a reappraisal of the traditional devotion to the Sacred Heart. FUNDAMENTAL THEOLOGY - A 'SPIRITUAL CHRISTOLOGY' Fundamental or foundational theology examines the basis of our faith and the theological discourse which expresses it. Develop ments in this area of modern theology lay great stress on the cen trality of religious experience, with a new openness to a theological discourse that is metaphorical, narrative and symbolic - as well as conceptual. This new openness to symbolic discourse in fundamental theology leads to a 'spiritual Christology' (Ratzinger)1 and is clearly relevant to the theology of the heart of Christ. I would make the following observations in this respect. First, it is clear that historically, especially in its seventeenth-century manifestation to which we are chiefly indebted, devotion to the Sacred Heart met a real need in the life of Roman Catholics. At a time when theology (reason) and spirituality (feelings) were effectively isolated from one another, and with the Enlightenment stress on reason and its downgrading of faith, this devotion helped to make God present and visible in a world that was becoming increasingly secularized. Secondly, we in our own time still need to find authentic sym 1. See J. Ratzinger, Behold the Pierced One, San Francisco, 1986 (tr), passim. Gerard O'Hanlon is an Irish Jesuit.

This need to make contact with the deeper dimensions of reality is expressed in the secular sphere at present in a reaction to a kind of knowing and loving that is technologically informed, that stresses control and utility, that is instrumental in character.2 This adverse reaction is not surprising in an age when science on its own cannot answer the questions posed by the threat of nuclear holocaust and the millions who starve in our world. This need for contact with the transcendent dimension of reality goes deeper than intellectual assent to the existence of God. It requires symbolic expression in order to touch us at the centre of our beings and so enlighten and transform daily life. In this context Donal Murray notes that in Ireland 'the impoverishment of popular devotion and the simplification of liturgical rites have given rise to a certain loss of the religious sym bolism and insight which surrounded the Mass'.3 He appeals to writers and artists, heirs to a very rich Irish tradition, to help us recreate the sense of the presence of God in the world. Thirdly there is the leading question of whether or not devotion to the Sacred Heart, with its acknowledged historical success, can still fulfil this need for symbol which exists today. Rahner, Arrupe and Ratzinger all argue that it can.4 They all presuppose that for this to happen a theological reappraisal of the content of the devotion must be undertaken. But the basis for their confidence lies beyond intellectual content, in the symbolic power of the word 'heart' to convey what is central about humankind and God in a way which no other words, concrete or abstract, can do. However the matter cannot rest there. All three are themselves aware that for various reasons there is a great deal of resistance in modern times to this 'natural' symbol. Much of this resistance may be attributed to the legacy of the recent past, and in this respect it may be said that the devotion has become a victim of its own suc cess. A predominantly anti-intellectual notion of heart in the eigh teenth century led in the nineteenth century to an emotionalistic devotion in which sentimentality arguably replaced a more deeply rooted feeling.5 This found expression in artistic representations of 2.

Arrupe in particular is very aware of the way in which many have become indifferent or even have a sub conscious aversion to the devotion, considering it anachronistic and in bad taste. He clearly does not share this repugnance himself and is confident that the allergic reaction will pass, but he notes its roots in outmoded devotional practices', tawdry and inartistic representations, and Certain exaggerations and manifestations of aff ectivity'. Of course it is notoriously difficult to argue about taste, and in any case bad taste may not be the final arbiter in such matters. Nonetheless I think we have a duty to respond to the chal lenge to engage in intelligent discourse about God, and our symbols ought to reflect this. We do need to avoid elitism of course; but equally there is need to guard against a patronizing attitude towards the Simple faithful'. This attitude, with a kind of inverted snobbery, fails to distinguish between what is simplistic and what is simple, and so is unable to purify what appeals to popular taste. I would suggest that apart from these considerations of history which bear on reception of the Sacred Heart devotion today there is a certain new literal-mindedness in the twentieth century, due to our saturation with television and film images, which is resistant to the deeper effects of symbols. In particular it would seem that the 'heart' symbol has been trivialized and debased in service of a very superficial notion of romantic love, to such an extent that it may no longer be presumed to evoke what is deepest and most central in human beings. This combination of historical legacy and present difficulty means that devotion to the Sacred Heart is presented with a problem that is as much a matter of culture as it is of theology. Precisely because symbols are supra-rational we must recognize that we cannot argue people into accepting them. Sensibilities differ and change,6 there is a correct subjectivity at work in the choice of symbols. In this sense I believe it is insufficient to argue like Arrupe that the contemporary resistance is irrational. Rather what is required would seem to be more understanding of the way symbols work, of how to create new ones or of how to adapt and redirect old ones to suit new times in a way which conveys the substance of the original symbol. Arrupe is surely correct however in arguing that if the symbolic power of the Sacred Heart is to be renewed it can only happen if it is given a content more in line with some of the findings of modern theology. It is to this content that we now turn. 6. See Paul VI, Marialis Cultus, 1974, Introduction.</page><page sequence="4">MODERN THEOLOGY AND THE HEART OF CHRIST 81 IN THE LIFE OF THE TRINITY First then the Sacred Heart clearly refers us to the significance of the humanity of Christ.7 It is through this humanity that the possibility of our own humanity is revealed to us and realized for us. As man, and centrally as man who died on the Cross, Jesus, who is also God, is our mediator with God and source of our par ticipation in the divine life. His continuing and permanent resur rected humanity in heaven indicates that our own dignity lies not in a denial but in a transformation of our humanity. Very con cretely the humanity of Jesus is expressed by the sensitivity of his heart - like us in all things, including suffering - so that we may be very realistic in ascribing to him the normal human intellectual operations and so on. The heart as unity of our intellectual, voli tional and affective dimensions is then a good symbol of the humanity of Christ. This shift in theological perspective towards a focus on the humanity of Christ would seem to harmonize well with devotion to the Sacred Heart. I would caution however that, for some, devo tion to the Sacred Heart assumes an exaggerated life of its own in a way that fails to see the connections with the human Jesus and with God. Stories about people becoming blocked in directed retreats because the Scripture readings proposed for prayer talked all about the Yahweh or Jesus, and never about the Sacred Heart, are not just apochryphal! Secondly the heart of Christ expresses the person of Christ, and in particular the inner meaning of his person which is love. It is here that modern theology has most to contribute. It does so by noting first how the love of Jesus is directed primarily and ultimately to his Father. Jesus is the 'man for others' because he is first and last for the Father in the Holy Spirit. The human heart of Jesus sym bolizes his divine love within the Trinity, a dimension of the devo tion that has been neglected in the past.8 We are directed here to the great mystery that the absolute God is love through the distinc tions of personal relations, in a way which combines unity and diversity and is the basic paradigm and condition of possibility of all created existence. This love is revealed in Christ's Incarnation and Cross to be kenotic, i.e. it involves self-emptying, a selflessness that gives itself to all and especially to those in most need. The implications for us are vast - to be a person is now defined as to be in relation; and in relation to Christ we meet not only the Father and the Spirit, but all others with whom Christ is in communion by being human. Furthermore the normative way of responding to Christ's love is through love of these others, especially those who 7. See Rahner, T.L, 3, 35-46 especially. 8. See Rahner, T.L, 3, 35-46, 337; Ratzinger, 13 f.</page><page sequence="5">82 THE FURROW are most needy (Mt. 25), with all the personal and structural dimen sions that this involves. This is a loving response which is made even in situations when by all human calculations there is no hope that love will effect any visible transformation. This then is what grace is about, what participation in the trinitarian life entails. The heart of Christ expresses that enormous love of God for all of us, especially those who are poor. It expresses the fact that it is the warmth of this love which gives meaning to human history and allows us to rejoice in life even when there is sorrow. Thirdly - and moving beyond traditional Sacred Heart devotion - this notion of the heart of Jesus which suffers out of love introduces us to the possibility of considering something like suffer ing to be present in God himself. Great caution is needed here to avoid an anthropomorphic reduction of God. Nonetheless modern theology has tried to find a way to understand the passionate God of Scripture in categories which are more suitable than the Stoic influenced idea of impassibility (apatheia). Ratzinger9 (with Galot, von Balthasar, Moltmann, Maritain and many others) speaks of something like suffering in God as a perfection of love. Balthasar is careful to say that this speech is analogous and that it refers to something very mysterious in God. Nonetheless this is a very important development. I would caution however that some for mulations of a suffering God reduce God to being human in a way which destroys both divine transcendence and, with it, our confidence in the final meaning and victory of love in the world. One can make a God of suffering in such a way that a cult of suffer ing develops, justifying false theologies of the Cross and a passivity that ultimately cloaks one's own egoism.10 Doctrinally I would guess that this is the area which has caused most problems for prospective devotees of the Sacred Heart in our modern context. Is not God's love unconditional, and if so how can there be any question of reparation? I note first that while this is a controverted area in modern theological debate the value of reparation is retained by most protagonists in the debate. In dif ferent ways theologians stress God's fidelity to the created order, to the justice which is due to all, and so within the unconditional love of God they suggest the appropriateness of reparation as indicating that in a world of evil and injustice the forgiveness of love does not come cheaply. In this context Christ's own suffering reveals the identification of God with all victims of sin, so that the 'complaints' of the Sacred Heart are in fact for our benefit. Secondly, Rahner stresses the value of works of supererogation as 9. See Ratzinger, op. cit., 54-60. 10. See Arrupe, op. cit., 86, 125-131.</page><page sequence="6">MODERN THEOLOGY AND THE HEART OF CHRIST 83 well as prayers offered in reparation. Such 'works' might well include something like the self-denying spirit of the Pioneers. How ever it would also be very much in Rahner's mind to extend this notion to include all good works, especially those which aim to make this world a better, more just place. We are back once again to the notion that the test of our love for God is how we love others in the world. This social work - the betterment of the world at a 'horizontal' level - is very much in evidence in the likes of Fr Cullen the nineteenth-century founder of the Pioneers, who worked with prisoners and the homeless. It may however have been lost sight of in a more 'vertical', eschatological approach to reparation in the traditional Sacred Heart devotion. Thirdly, and crucially, Rahner notes that any voluntary works of self-sacrifice are really only secondary to, and preparatory for, the particular share in Christ's cross that the Father has decreed for each of us. It is in obedience to this mission of the Father that the chief value of our suffering lies (as it did for Christ). This entails an attention to discernment. It also means, as Rahner several times cautions, that a great deal of discretion and prudence needs to be exercised in this whole area. This is so because individuals may be excessively prone to a kind of neurotic masochism, Rahner's 'sacrificial souls', and be too passively mournful with regard to Christian suffering without realizing that its ultimate goal is joyful transformation. Rahner clearly believes that a wrong focus on reparation can lead to excessive self-examination and self-mastery, where the focus shifts from God to the self who now has some con trol over God, forgetful that all value comes from God in the first place. SOME COMMENTS I have three related comments to make by way of critical observa tion on the foregoing. First, mainly due to the historical form of the devotion to which we are heirs, I do think that there is a very real problem for many in our culture at the level of the message conveyed by the image of the Sacred Heart. In the theatre in Ireland an image of the Sacred Heart is often code for a traditional ethos of sin, guilt and mistrust of the body that is antipathetic to our age. But more generally and centrally the spiritualized, soulful-looking Jesus of traditional Sacred Heart representations is, I would submit, an inaccurate and damaging interpretation of Mt 11, 28-30: 'for I am gentle and humble in heart'. What is proposed in this representation is a sub missive model of humanity that shuns any kind of anger or asser tiveness. This is in harmony with the lovable but harmless figure implied by the well-known banner 'God bless the Sacred Heart!',</page><page sequence="7">84 THE FURROW but is false to the scriptural person of Christ.' It is a dangerous model for Christians who have psychological difficulties with their own aggression and anger. Theologically too it is a mis-reading of our creaturehood - relationality and dependence on God mean that we become more, not less, real and ourselves, gifted children called to a free and adult relationship with God (friends, not servants) in which a relative autonomy and personal responsibility are to be exercised. This again is the trinitarian model of love, in which 'otherness' is valued, and we must be consistent in applying it to our own lives. Rahner goes so far as to suggest that this excessively submissive T am a worm and no man' attitude towards God is in fact a form of false pride. It is so because in recognizing that I am not the Absolute I refuse to be satisfied with my reality as creature and to give God praise for it. Secondly, this failure to trust in God (and so in ourselves) in an adult way can manifest itself in a religious fundamentalism, a desire for an infantile sort of security which the Sacred Heart devo tion may appear to satisfy. Of course it is true that we are all of us always dependent on God. We live filially, in the security of being loved by our Father in heaven, and there are dimensions of beauty, mystery and wonder in this truth to which devotion to the Sacred Heart is sensitive. However an uncritical hankering after a peaceful life is not scriptural. As expressed in a popular devotion it may at worst degenerate into superstition, and at best into a form of individual piety that pays attention to the problems of the world only through the words of prayer and rarely through the deeds of love. When this happens mystery is being used as an avoidance of reality, a flight from the world, instead of a deeper contact with it. The chevalier-like other-worldly image of the Sacred Heart may lead to a reassurance that homes and lives are safe, but it may be a reassurance that owes more to a superstitious and magical seeking after 'signs and wonders' than to any intimacy with the real Christ and any acceptance of the vagaries of our human hearts. Thirdly, in the light of these two comments and of the earlier outline, I suggest a principal way in which the devotion to the Sacred Heart may become more viable in our modern context. It would seem that the doctrinal reappraisal, with its emphasis on our participation in the trinitarian life and its effects on human history, harmonizes well with the notion that our culture needs to be transformed rather than simply denied. Creation and the Incarna tion mean that God is immanent in our world. This is God whose transcendence or otherness is manifested chiefly as transforming love, with a preferential regard for the neediest. The effects of this love are anticipated now, if realized fully only at the end of history, while similarly reparation to this love has consequences for this life</page><page sequence="8">MODERN THEOLOGY AND THE HEART OF CHRIST 85 as well as the next. With this kind of theological perspective the devotion to the Sacred Heart may be fully inserted in the service of faith, of which the promotion of justice is an integral part. With this perspective too one avoids the excesses of what Arrupe refers to as a 'reductive horizontalism or an unicarnate verticalism', while one speaks to modern women and men at the centre of their con cerns. This would mean an attempt to use popular devotions in a way which promotes critical questions, awareness and change with regard to society at large. In particular it would mean using the devotion to the Sacred Heart in a way which inspires us to be conscientized with regard to the unjust situations and structures which characterize our world. Since this devotion has been particu larly popular among those who are less well-off, there would seem to be a special value and opportunity here in purifying it in a way which avoids the extremes of spiritual reductionism or social activism. This would of course mean quite a radical shift in the traditional meaning of the Sacred Heart symbol, analogous perhaps to a possible shift in the symbolic meaning of the Irish tricolour from being anti-British to something more positively native. It would involve a re-education of very basic feelings and associations.</page></plain_text>
