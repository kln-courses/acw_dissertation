<plain_text><page sequence="1">Max Esser's "Bakundu Fetishes" UTE M. ROSCHENTHALER ife-size sculptures from the forest region of southwestern Cameroon are rare in museums of the Western world. Sally Chilver and I came across such sculptures during our research on Max Esser, a German entrepreneur from Cologne, who established large cocoa plantations around Mount Cameroon in the 1890s (Chilver &amp; Roschenthaler, forth- coming). The carvings are reproduced in his book An der Westkiiste Afrikas: Wirt- schaftliche und Jagd-Streifziige (1898) with the caption "Fetishes from Bulo N'Guti" 76 (Fig. 1). Chilver spurred me on to trace their present location-not an easy task. Although Esser himself describes the sculptures as "Bakundu fetishes," the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart, where I eventually found three of them, classified them as "Bali" art. Neither attribution, however, seemed correct. But before ad- dressing the question of provenance, let us turn to the few facts that can be gleaned from Esser's account. Max Esser acquired the four sculptures in 1896, on an exploratory trip to Came- roon along the "Bali Road" from Douala on the coast to the kingdom of Bali in the Grassfields to the north. The aim of that trip was to convince the king of Bali to sign a contract that would send young Bali men to the coast to work on Esser's proposed plantations. The German busi- nessman had a sense for valuable objects, as he came from a family of lawyers who were interested in art. However, like many occasional collectors of ethnographic items during that time, he did not feel it neces- sary to provide details about where he first saw the sculptures or information about their use, or even their local names. He regarded them simply as trophies. In his book, Esser offers only a brief mention of This page: 1. Four sculptures collected by Max Esser in 1896 in southwest Cameroon. From Esser's An der Westkuste Afrikas (1898:112). Esser called these "Bakundu fetishes," but the Linden-Museum, Stuttgart, which acquired the two smaller life-sized figures and the decorated board in 1899, had classified them as "Bali." Both attributions are incorrect. The whereabouts of the largest figure are unknown. Opposite page: Left: 2. Male figure. Bafaw, Cameroon. Wood, 139cm (55"). Linden-Museum, Stuttgart, inv. no. 3.393.

At Ikiliwindi (according to him the largest "Bakundu" village) in southwestern Cameroon, the chief sold him "his very artistic fetish in exchange for an accordion, which, since this new god was able to speak, seemed to him a far more appropriate object of devotion..." (all translations in this article are mine). The next day, in a village that Esser called Bulo N'Guti, he exchanged some goods for three "man-high fetishes" after "lengthy negotiations" with the chief and the local "sorcerer." Esser describes the sculptures: "They incude a man and a woman, both life-size and fully naked, and between them a broad board with carvings: these depict heads of human beings and animals surrounded by flowers, hearts, squares, balls, and bones-signs whose interpreta- tion I must leave to the experts" (Figs. 2-4). So far, however, the experts have not said much about them. Sculptures of this size do not seem to be in use today. Most Bakundu carvings are no taller than thirty centimeters (Valentin 1972). The largest of Esser's "fetishes"- the one from Ikiliwindi that is not in the Stuttgart museum-must have been more than two meters high. The photograph in An der Westkiiste Afrikas shows a cylinder extending upward from its head that could well have been part of a pillar. But did Esser really acquire his sculp- tures in Bakundu villages? The decorated board, for example, includes elements seen in Bafaw sculptures, such as the diamond- shaped frame around the upper head. Bulo N'Guti, where Esser collected it, is not found on moder maps. Its name today is Kurume, a Bafaw village in the Southwest Province. Bulo mbu N'Guti refers to a title given chiefs and "big men" of one of the Bafaw dans (Dundas 1922; personal com- munication, Nfon Epie, Kurume, March 1999). Ikiliwindi, where Esser acquired the largest figure, is also a Bafaw village. Esser and other early explorers described Bulo N'Guti as Bakundu, a term for the entire area around Kumba in the South- west Province, as the first missionaries were stationed at a Bakundu village (Bohn- er 1898:376). It is quite possible that the Linden-Museum's classification of Esser's sculptures as Bali art was due to contem- porary opinion which held that the art of the Grassfields was more prestigious than that of the forest (Fowler 1997:73). The two smaller figures from "Bulo N'Guti" and the small stools photographed with the other sculptures Esser collected are indeed remi- niscent of simpler Grassfields styles. I know of only two other comparably sized figures from the so-called Bakundu area. One, in the Berlin Museum fur Volkerkunde, was displayed in the exhibi- tion "Africa: The Art of a Continent" 4.

Shrine of the Ngbe or Ejagham leopard society with decorated stone pillar. Ajaman village, Came- roon, December 1998. Photo: Ute R6schenthaler. These stone pillars are kept in meeting halls, as are decorated basalt pillars found among peo- ples of southwest Cameroon. (Phillips 1996:348), and is quite well known through various publications (see Krieger 1978, pl. 145; Sydow 1954: fig. 49D; Beumers &amp; Koloss 1992:308). This male statue, 1.72 meters tall, was collected in 1899 by the German colonial officer L. Conradt in a vil- lage called Bonge, probably Bakundu. The right half of its body is painted brown, the left white. Its head is surrounded by a dia- mond-shaped frame resembling that on Esser's board sculpture and some other Bafaw sculptures (see Krieger 1978: pl. 155). Heinrich Balz (1992:308-9) and Keith Nicklin (1995/1996:348) have suggested that the raised right hand possibly was pointing at something with a spear, now missing. This seems to be true of Esser's sculpture from Ikiliwindi as well, though the gesture is difficult to reconstruct since its right hand is broken off. The second similar sculpture reached the Basel Mission Museum in 1898 (Gardi 1994: fig. 8). The Presbyterian missionary Nathanael Lauffer acquired it from the Balong village of Ndo in exchange for the presence of a Christian teacher and a pile of goods (Gardi 1994:20-22). The statue is huge-approximately two meters high- and served as a pillar of the village meeting hall. Its body was painted in black, red, and green stripes. Called Dikoki, it wore a skirt of cloth and held a staff with both hands. The accounts of early German explor- ers, missionaries, and colonial officers in the 1880s and 1890s suggest that large sculptures like those collected by Max Esser were widespread in the area around Kumba, where they were seen in community halls or "fetish houses" of the Bakundu, Ngolo, Balong, and Bafaw (Zintgraff 1895; Hutter 1902; Wurm 1904:5-6). Some of the anthropomorphic images were part of the main pillar, and others were freestanding statues. Stefan Rogozinsky even saw one in a jumping pose in front of the main column inside a chief's house (1884:134). The larger fig- ures were often surrounded by smaller sculptures and additional items of magic use, such as snail shells, rat tails, and dried bird heads (Buchner 1914:268-69). There were also pillars of basalt, painted in squares, with a face and a cap on top. Shrines with decorated stone pillars are associated with the Ngbe (leopard) soci- ety of the Ejagham to the northwest. The Ejagham also keep them in their meeting halls (Figs. 5, 6). The German officer Lessner (1904) reproduced a decorated board of the Ngolo which resembles the one Esser col- lected. Such boards were also used in the Djengu association by the Duala and the winter 1999 ? atrican arts Bakwiri to the south. The symbols on the board served as mnemonic devices dur- ing initiation (Ittmann 1957; for more details on the early accounts see R6schen- thaler, in press). The early German visitors usually men- tioned three "fetish houses" in a village, each house apparently associated with one or more cult agencies or women's and men's associations that were abun- dant among the abovementioned peo- ples. The associations enabled a person to gain titles and status; the cult agencies protected the village. Both were repre- sented by masked dancers and sculptures of various sizes called ekale or njimbiri (Bohner 1898; personal communication, Balong elders, Mukonye, March 1999). During my most recent fieldwork in Ejagham country in 1998-99, I made a short trip to the area where Esser had col- lected the sculptures. The chiefs and elders of Bafaw, Balong, and Bakundu villages to whom I showed photographs of the life- size sculptures seemed surprised to learn that they had been collected in their com- munities. They assured me that they had never seen such large carvings themselves. Bakundu chiefs still own smaller sculp- tures, mosungusungu, which are in the pos- session of titleholders of the Basungo society. Most of the chiefs immediately rec- ognized some similarity to Grassfields works. Chief Ekale of Ikiliwindi suggest- ed that Bafaw carvers used to imitate Grassfields art forms which represented authority, and that other peoples commis- sioned their sculptures from them. Today there are no carvers among the Bafaw. Chief Ewane II of the Balong village of Mundame suggested that the chiefs of various ethnic groups used to exchange sculptures as valuable objects and diplo- matic gifts. As Ian Fowler notes (1997:73), the place of acquisition and the prove- nance of an artwork or any other example of material culture are not necessarily identical. Esser acquired his sculptures in Bafaw villages. Villages in the area not only exchanged art objects, but bought and resold entire associations. Thus, cult agencies and associations disseminated 79 ------ ir i</page><page sequence="5">together with their objects across ethnic boundaries and throughout the entire area, from the coast of Calabar and Douala up to the Grassfields. It is hardly surprising that chiefs today appear to know so little about these works. Before the turn of the century, missionar- ies and German colonial officers were al- ready reporting the disappearance of the large sculptures in this area. H. Bohner (in Gardi 1994:33) wrote that during their first visits in Balong villages, he and his fellow Basel missionaries were allowed to have a look at the statues and even touch them, but there was no way to acquire one. Eugen Zintgraff, too, tried in vain to buy such a figure in the Balong village of Baduma (1895:83). The growing influence of the Christian Mission, however, and the local popula- tion's desire for fashionable European 80 goods led to a trade in art objects which could be called the "commodification of the fetishes." The Basel missionaries ascribed the beginning of this process to a few baptized Africans who courageously deposited their objects with them in 1895. A few years later, the colonial officer Conradt arrested several of the most influential "fetish priests" at Kumba, ac- cusing them of planning to attack him and to incite the local population against cooperation with the German station. Bohner writes that as a result of this inci- dent, still more people brought their sculptures to him. He kept the most in- teresting ones for himself and burned the rest (Bohner 1998:383; Lauffer 1998). Under similar circumstances the mission- ary Lauffer acquired the sculpture called Dikoki in the Balong village of Ndo for the Basel Museum. 6.

According to the missionaries, people sold their sculptures, at first secretly. Soon individual owners began doing so publicly, as did the secret societies as a whole. A trader would then sell the works at Douala. From there, they found their way to Europe (Bohner 1898:382). Missionaries' assessment of this turn of events was euphemistic. Although some sculptures could be ritually removed and later renewed, the influence of the mis- sionaries was not without detrimental impact on the artistic production of the local population. All these developments occurred around the time of Max Esser's journey. Returning to Europe, Esser began to set up his cocoa plantations. He also began giv- ing lectures at various renowned learned societies on the colonies, among them the Verein fur Handelsgeographie in Stutt- gart. Shortly afterward, in 1897, Graf von Linden, a member of that association and the founder of the Linden-Museum, wrote Esser, asking him to donate his collection to the king of Wiirttemberg, for exhibition in the museum. Esser answered one year later, enclosing a copy of his newly pub- lished book and promising to send his large "fetishes" and a collection of pipes and arms. After receiving these works, von Linden conveyed the king's apprecia- tion and suggested that Esser also donate the rest of his collection, especially the fig- ure from Ikiliwindi, more Bali pipes, and Bali women's spears. Promised a decora- tion from the king, Esser sent these objects in January 1899. The entry books of the Linden-Museum record 210 items from the Esser collection. Most of them are small objects from Bali: 75 pieces of jewelry and horns filled with substances, several musical instruments, helmets and caps, knives, swords and whips, men's and women's spears, bas- kets and fur bags, 74 decorated clay pipes, and 38 women's "garments"-tiny woven aromatic grass skirts bound around the waist and embellished with a colorful peacock-like decoration at the back. Today, however, barely half the collection remains in Stuttgart, mainly because of damage suffered in the Second World War, and an earlier policy that allowed ex- changes with other museums. The figure from Ikiliwindi, the largest of the four sculptures and one of the objects Graf von Linden had specifically solicited, is not in the museum, nor is it mentioned in the entry lists. In his letter accompanying the second donation, Esser regretted that "the fetish of Ikiliwindi had been stolen on the way to Europe and despite all endeavors to this day has not been recovered."
