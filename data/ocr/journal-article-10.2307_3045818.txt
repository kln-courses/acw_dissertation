Pp. 419; 20 color ills., 299 black-and-white ills. $90 Despite Thomas Cole's importance in the history of American painting, Ellwood Parry's 1988 book (released in 1989) constitutes the first full-length, scholarly study of the artist and his work. Until Parry's monograph, the standard sources on Cole were William Dunlap's account in his 1834 History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States, Henry C. Tuckerman's biography in his 1847 Artist-Life: or, Sketches of American Painters, Louis L. Noble's 1853 The Life and Works of Thomas Cole, and Howard S. Merritt's 1969 catalogue for the Cole exhibition at the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester.' The publication of two, essentially popular, biographies of Cole-by Matthew Baigell (1981) and Earl A. Powell (1990)2-as well as the planning of a major Cole exhibition by the National Museum of American Art for 1994 are clear indications of Cole's growing reputation and an increased desire, on the part of the general public, to know more about him. Parry's scholarly reexamination of Cole's work developed as an enlargement and reconsideration of his 1970 Ph.D. dissertation, "Thomas Cole's The Course of Empire: A Study in Serial Imagery." The book begins not with Cole himself but, rather, with Cole's list of pictures that he had completed in 1825. In that year, Cole's career as a successful artist effectively started when three more-established artists-John Trumbull, William Dunlap, and Asher B. Durand- "discovered" some of his landscapes in the hands of a New York dealer. They not only admired these scenes from along the Hudson River, but they also purchased three of them and, by announcing the fact publicly, gave a boost to the younger artist's reputation. From this point on, the book is organized as a chronological treatment, within eight chapters, of Cole's known paintings, with consideration of such matters as the different versions and their buyers, their exhibition and the public response, and Cole's related travels as he propelled his career forward and developed schemes for increased recognition. The better part of a chapter each is devoted to his two famous series, The Course of Empire and The Voyage of Life; and his third, large series-equally ambitious but unfin- ished-The Cross and the World, forms the centerpiece of the final chapter. The author treats this last series as a culmination, poten- tially superior even to the two better-known series. In an epilogue, Parry discusses the immediate aftermath of Cole's death in 1848 at age forty-seven, the plans for a commemorative exhibition, and finally Cole's present reputation. The catalogue of the 1848 Memo- rial Exhibition as well as a chronology of Cole's life appear in appendixes. Throughout the book, the author maintains his focus on the paintings rather than the artist in an attempt to establish their precise chronology and, in many cases, their pictorial precedents. Part of this research has already been published by the author in several important articles pertaining to some of the earlier paint- ings, so that, in general but not always, it is in considering the later 'H.S. Merritt, Thomas Cole, exh. cat., Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester, Rochester, 1969. 2 M. Baigell, Thomas Cole, New York, 1981, and E.A. Powell, Thomas Cole, New York, 1990. works that the book provides its freshest contributions. The more engaging discussions revolve, perhaps inevitably, around Cole's unusual serial paintings. Parry's diligent use of documentation, often from Cole's surviving correspondence and historical newspaper commentary, forms the solid core of the book. With strong documentary support and a thorough knowledge of the period, he repeatedly makes convincing formal and iconographic connections. In a few cases, however, where he has ferreted out a visual source, the match is not persuasive, at least to this reader, and can perhaps be explained otherwise. See, for example, the discussions of the primitive huts and the running figure in The Course of Empire: The Savage State (pp. 154-158); the composition in Study for the Voyage of Life: Manhood and the guardian angel in Figure Study for the Voyage of Life: Childhood (pp. 233-234). In the latter instance, a classical face, a slightly downward gaze, and legs following the almost ubiquitous, classical contrapposto pose are all that link Cole's angel in his Figure Study with its proposed source, the angel in Washington Allston's The Angel Releasing Saint Peter From Prison. Seen at different angles, the figures do not closely correspond and, in fact, they diverge with regard to body type, hair length, wing shape, details of costume, and the pose of the upper body. Parry, as he himself says, is attracted to the challenge of tracing pictorial motifs (p. 15), but the search seems somewhat forced at times. Another example of what appears to be overzealousness in using this approach occurs in the case of Prometheus in Cole's large painting of Prometheus Bound. Cole describes Prometheus on the label affixed to the reverse of the painting as "attached to the mountain in the manner of one crucified," and indeed the vertical pose that Cole used resembles the traditional one of Christ on the Cross in scenes where Christ is shown from the side. But Parry finds the "closest pictorial precedent" for this posture in an 1823 lithograph after Gericault's Mazeppa where Mazeppa is shown in a more bow-like, and therefore dissimilar, position against the back of a horse (p. 329). Cole might easily instead have hired a village model to approximate the pose of the crucified Christ as the basis for his figure (such live models appear to be mentioned in reference to another painting in ajournal entry of 1843 on p. 280). The most difficult iconographic problem, without doubt, con- cerns Cole's small oil painting of a gigantic, populated goblet set down within a mountainous landscape. He entitled the work Titan's Goblet. The image itself does not agree with either an earlier interpretation that it is a representation of the Yggdrasil myth or with Parry's suggestion that it stems from a passage in Vitruvius about an architect who once suggested that Mount Athos be carved into the figure of a man holding a city in one hand and a huge cup, containing all the collected streams of the mountain, in the other (pp. 138-139). Cole's depiction apparently derives from fanciful drawings that he had made about a year earlier, of fountains and basins overgrown with vegetation,3 but, given his propensity for allegory, the more developed painting probably represents a sym- bolic interaction between the two, tiny civilizations that are shown: one an Arcadian ideal, supported by the upright goblet; and the 3 See E.C.

The reader might become bothered by this as well as by the strictly chronological, rather than conceptual, organization, which results sometimes in a sacrifice of the logical flow of narration. Possibly the worst example is an interruption of an enlightening discussion of Cole's progress on the Voyage of Life series with a ten-page digression on extraneous paintings and Cole's venture into architecture (pp. 241-251). This book comes on the heels of some rather provocative challenges to traditional interpretations of Cole and his work: semiological and psychoanalytical discussions of some of Cole's paintings by Bryan Wolf in his 1982 Romantic Re-Vision,5 which Parry mentions and discards (p. 57); and a more conventionally accept- able argument, which Parry does not address, probing the motiva- tions of Cole and a few of his Federalist patrons, in Alan Wallach's 1981 article, "Thomas Cole and the Aristocracy," in Arts Magazine.6 Prompted by these efforts and others, if by nothing else, Parry might have paid more attention to interpretation and thereby have provided us with a more developed account of the artist. Although one learns much about Cole's paintings, one leaves Parry's book without the impression that one really knows Cole. The opportunity to establish a sense of the man is partly precluded by the fact that the text does not cover Cole's early formative years. This includes those he spent as an engraver's assistant in England and as a painter of theatrical scenery in Ohio. Parry says in the preface that his treatment of this period will be published elsewhere (p. 14), but a subsequent footnote tells the reader that this part of Cole's life has already been published separately as a section in the 1986 Corcoran Gallery exhibition catalogue, Views and Visions.7 There are additional opportunities, which are overlooked, for interpreting Cole within the time frame of the book. One of Cole's most intriguing and telling statements, made in 1838, is that "I never succeed in painting scenes, however beautiful, immediately on returning from them [.] I must wait for Time to draw a veil over the common details" (p. 201). This sounds very like the recommen- dation of Sir Joshua Reynolds, in his second and ninth discourses, and the method described by Washington Allston, whom Cole had met in 1828, in his published novel Monaldi. Parry lets this rather rich confession pass and uses the letter in which it appeared to confirm that Cole was then working on certain paintings. Other fascinating quotations with wider implications that might be developed in the future include Cole's description in 1826 of a wooded area southwest of Albany in anthropomorphic terms: "The hemlock with its grey mossy head . . . arms over the trees [like a] patriarch blessing his children . . . some trees intertwining their branches with others as though in affection.... The young support- ing the aged" (p. 31); and Henry Tuckerman's 1867 response to Cole's highly contrived and sentimental The Hunter's Return as "altogether a beautiful and most authentic illustration of American life and nature" (p. 311). In the epilogue, Parry disagrees with a recent "pejorative reading" of Cole's art as "transitional" to luminism. He sees "evidence, however faint, of luminist tendencies" in the light that appears in some of Cole's late work and therefore denies that Cole is merely transitional. There is difficulty here in that luminism, as a category, is a 20th-century invention that has had a flexible definition. If it is 4 For another interpretation-one that is well argued-see H.A.

Cole's dramatic use of light in Parry's late examples surely developed from the concept of the sublime as defined by Edmund Burke. Parry's book makes a number of significant contributions, such as its correction of the common assumption that Cole's American scenes were the ones that were consistently preferred by the picture-buying public (pp. 204-205). As a compendium of careful archival research, this book will unquestionably be used as the basis for further scholarship, but it also leaves much to be done in the way of both a full catalogue raisonn6 and a more thorough exploration of how Cole relates to his contemporaries.

Pp. 375; 16 color pls., 553 ills. The characterization of the arts as "visual" serves to obscure the simple and important fact that the long tradition of Western painting descending from Greek classicism has been more or less explicitly optical. It has been optical in two ways. First, the perennial goal of the imitation of appearances has been achieved primarily by showing the surfaces of recognizable forms as if they were surfaces in light and therefore in space. Such imitation is optical in the sense that, whatever else it might do, its elements are light, dark, and color, shown as if from a more or less definite point of view, as appearances to the eye. The familiar features of modeling and highlights-the constituents of the "heritage of Apelles"-are optical in this basic and culturally specific sense. Light and shadow imply sources of light with respect to forms and also imply the geometrically regular behavior of light, since shadows are cast and light sources are reflected in predictable ways. This leads to the second meaning of the optical. Western painting has also developed at least in parallel to an intermittently developing tradition of optics, which, if perhaps less well known than the histories of physics, biology, or astronomy, has nonetheless been foundational for Western science in general. Western optics is based upon the premise that the relation of sight and its objects may be described geometrically and that this description allows us to explain why things do not appear to us as they "really" are, why objects of the same size appear smaller at a distance (because they are under a smaller angle of vision), or why round coins appear to be ovals (because they form a base nonperpendicular to the point of sight at the vertex of the visual angle.) Optics thus began as the paradoxical science of appearances. On the one hand, it explained appearances away by demonstrating that things are not really as they seem (or that they really are not as they seem); on the other hand, however, optics also provided constructions for appearances themselves, and thus might assist in fooling the eye, of deceiving Pliny's famous birds, or even great painters themselves. Western painters not only understood the forms they represented to be primarily optical, they also organized these forms in ways consistent with geometric optics, showing ground lines as sloping ground planes, and edges perpendicular to the surface as recessive diagonals, refining the foreshortened drawing corollary to their optical enterprise. Once again, these features of Western painting hardly seem extraordinary, and their historical appearance is usually attributed to observation, or to the study of nature. But again it may be suggested that a fundamental conception of painting as optical provided the deeper framework for these equally fundamental (and simple) devices of representation, devices that in their exploration and adaptation by painters might contribute to the understanding of the discipline of optics, just as the investiga-</page></plain_text>
