<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Volume 45, Number 2, April 2008 THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN Lenn Goodman J ohn Rawls is widely credited with restor ing normative discourse in politics. This might mean that his example freed theorists once too timid to buck the positivist tide that ran so strong in first two thirds of the twentieth century. Or perhaps, that his work liberated us from the machiavellian equation of realism with realpolitik that often attached to the idea of value free social science in the teaching of politics, history, and law. If so, there's some truth in the claim. Rawls did help make normative claims respectable where they had been shunned. He must share the credit, of course, with Watergate, which provoked widespread calls for a new infusion of moral concerns into politics, and especially for the teaching of morality to our leaders and professionals. Such spirited calls exter nalized the infamy, ducking any admission that Watergate, like so many other scandals, was not just a violation of the ethos but also an ugly caricature of it-spit and image of the moral notion long modeled in the Lone Ranger's forays into villains' safes and of fices, that conscientious subterfuge is fine, if it stays sub rosa-the subtext, perhaps, in Kissinger's teaching that in politics principles mean nothing without effectiveness. The Vienna Circle, their influence grown immense by mid-century, in the efflores cence of scientistic optimism, shunned the language of morals. They had seen it carried off by extremist ideologues to misty meta physical heights, and restored, deflowered and enchained, a handmaid to dubious and dangerous causes. Positivism seemed clearer and cleaner. Others, in the wake of those pur ists, found pragmatism more down to earth. Utilitarianism, at least, was naturalistic and forward looking; and Marxism, if one could trust its claims and ignore the noises off from the dungeons and the gulag, looked scientific and progressive, the wave of the future. Even before Nazi commandants stood in the dock trying to hide their faces behind a pasteboard dossier tagged "My Station and its Duties," duty had been marked a four letter word. In the flood of war works that philosophers turned out during or soon after the Second World War-T. D. Weldon's Vocabulary of Politics, William McGovern's From Luther to Hitler, Karl Popper's The Open Society and its Enemies, and many others-absolutism was damned as the root of totalitarianism. Absolutism meant, among many other things, the belief that there is any objective difference between right and wrong. Philosophers in the positivist tradition, with an aw-shucks twang, a tug at the forelock or swipe at the cowlick, said that democracy was just their prejudice. Jurists like Chaim 81</page><page sequence="2">82 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Perelman, Hans Kelsen, and H. L. A. Hart, in other accents, said much the same. Law was a system of rules, a nest of rhetorical ploys, or a bed of performatives, its givens a matter of choice-or chance. That posture survives even today, in Rorty's dismissal of philosophy and his free confes sion that his own constitutional preferences are just his biases. It survives as well in the charge that George W. Bush and the neo cons force too black-and-white a vision of good and evil. And indeed, in Rawls's own appeals to tradition and bracketing of what he calls comprehensive-that is, religious or metaphysical-doctrines. Yet, Rawls did help free us from the commonplace ban on normative talk in politics. He did this, almost magically, without seeming to appeal to a comprehensive doctrine himself, or to violate Hume's strictures against pulling an ought from a high silk hat full of is-es. He did it, in fact, by telling a story. Of course Rawls's quieter colleague Harvey Mansfield deserves some of the credit for finding the moral subtext, an appeal to civic virtue, that Spinoza had sensed in Machiavel li's politics.2 But the work of another Harvard colleague, Robert Nozick, amply attests to Rawls's success in breaking the positivist spell. For Nozick answered Rawls's claims about redistribution by appeal to the moral authority of possession: What right, he asked, in Anarchy, State, and Utopia, has the state, or anyone, to take what is mine to aid some one else? That moral question has a moral answer: Spinoza's answer that private means and private sympathy fall short of meeting pressing human needs. And one could go further, by pressing Maimonides' thesis, that the highest charity (a facet of justice in the Mosaic canon3) comes to life when we aid others to self-sufficiency. Spinoza does not presume, with Rawls, that any unequal distribution is unfair unless it benefits the least advantaged. He does, however, cast a safety net; and Maimonides puts the spring and bounce into that net. But Nozick's moral appeal shows how fully the worm has turned from the days when philosophers called normative discourse nonsense and rarely or barely restrained themselves from branding it nasty nonsense as well-the days when "That's a value judgment" was a conversa tion stopper. Rawls's story is about a social contract. He shields it from Humean attack by frequent reminders that the contract is imaginary, the story a fantasy. Imagine, he proposes, a group of rational persons meeting to choose the rules by which they will be governed.4 They must make their choices under a veil of ignorance, not knowing what roles they will play in the new society, not even what talents, skills, or preferences they will bring with them on the day they come to birth as citizens.5 With no idea whether they will be rich or poor, wise or simple, artistic or prosaic-indeed, no no tion of their values beyond what Rawls thinks implicit in the bare idea of rationality itself, a disposition to pursue one's own interests and define those interests for oneself-they would choose a mode of governance, Rawls argues, that would safeguard their liberties, allowing them to continue to make choices in the future. And, in parceling out goods and ills, they would choose a system that maximized equality and that countenanced only those inequalities that would benefit the least advantaged among them.6 For, despite the veil, they seem well schooled in Pareto's equilibria and disequilibria. Further, Rawls argues, rational choosers would assign lexi cal priority to the first of his two principles over the second-so that formal rights would always trump material entitlements.7 What the thought experiment reveals, by Rawls's account, is what we would call justice: Justice as Fairness, as he labels the concept his scenario is meant to capture. That was the title of the 1955 article in which he broached his idea, preserved in the title of the volume that offered his final restatement of it</page><page sequence="3">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 83 in 2001. By then an estimated million words had been written about the thesis famously elaborated in A Theory of Justice, which aims to situate Rawls's claims in the literature of political philosophy and to answer and anticipate rejoinders from many quarters, while detailing the terms and conditions by which the theory could be implemented in practice. The results of the thought experiment, Rawls urges, tally with tradition-with Aris totle, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant-and with ''our intuitive conviction of the primacy of justice."8 The appeal, of course, whether to intuition or tradition, was to the idea of the social contract, since ancient times a power ful test of political legitimacy, and in early modem times a powerful fumigant against the divine right of kings.9 But the dissipation of monarchy robs the contract idea of some of its early revolutionary pungency, just as voting practices (including initiative, referendum, and recall) bring the idea of consent down from the mythic empyrean into the realm of prosaic and sometimes tarnished political practice. Rawls's appeal to shared ideas of justice is not meant to reduce his account to a mere analysis of usage.10 He was making normative claims. Yet he rested those claims on a seem ingly empiric premise: that the principles his thought experiment was meant to distill from the welter of notions about justice would be recognized by rational persons as the prin ciples that rational persons would choose in the conditions he specifies."1 So the thought experiment depends for its credibility on its hearers' acceptance of its verisimilitude. Hanna Pitkin seeks to parse the empiric and normative components of Rawls's counterfac tuals by taking an elementary confusion as her springboard: The proper question about a social contract, she explains, is not what anyone has consented to but rather what one ought to consent to. That might seem to run the quest for justice into a circle. Surely one ought to consent only to what is just. But lest the question of justice be left hanging, Pitkin supplies a test to be met by a just government: "whether its actions are in accord with the authority a hypothetical group of rational men in a state of nature would have (had) to give any government they were founding."12 That may seem more perspicuous. But it passes off the substantive questions onto the concepts of rationality and nature. Rawls defers to an economist's notion of rational choice to give pith to his idea of rationality. It's important to his case that the rationality in his model present a relatively thin profile. Just as Kant strove to derive the end-in-itself formulation of the categorical imperative from the more strictly formal universal-law formulation, and just as Lon Fuller sought to derive normativity from the logic of the idea of law, Rawls hopes to unpack the idea of rationality to yield the far richer and thicker idea of justice that he offers for recognition as our own. But, to the extent that the appeal is empirical in its claims about what we can and will identify as justice, the argument does fall afoul of Hume's critique-and of G. E. Moore's open question method. We are fallible, after all, and might be badly mistaken about justice. The point is not just academic, and Rawls's reference to tradition helps make that clear. For past theorists, and common folk as well, have accepted many practices and conditions that now seem manifestly unjust. It's quite possible, by the same token, that much that we accept today might seem grossly unjust to our successors. Yet, insofar as the argument is analytic, it becomes trivial, leaving every thing to rest on what we mean by 'rational' and whom we intend by 'we.' 13 Rawls was criticized on many grounds. Popularly, for his redistribution claims, which looked to many supporters and critics like a belated campaign manifesto for George McGovern. But philosophically, the word 'ra tional' lay at the heart of the trouble. If choos</page><page sequence="4">84 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY ers under the veil of ignorance are rational enough to prosecute their own interests and interested enough to preserve their liberties and pursue entitlements (typically, material goods and the means to secure them), how are they not rational enough to imagine that other goods might mean more to them (once their worth was known), more than property or possessions-perhaps more than power, or liberty itself?'4 Hadn't Rawls packed his idea of rationality with personal values and familiar preferences, while excluding values that he thought irrelevant but that others might cherish?"5 Among the many values to which Rawls's rational founders are blinkered: anarchy, adventure, beauty, candor, change, charity, creativity, dignity, discipline, domination, domesticity, dynasty, elan, energy, entertain ment, ethnicity, fertility, filial piety, grandeur, gratitude, health, holiness, honor, idealism, knowledge, love, militarism, nobility, novelty, obedience, piety, propriety, purity, quarrel someness, revolution, risk, ritual, science, self-sacrifice, style, victory, virtue, virtuosity, wisdom, xenophobia, youth, and zeal. I could instance many more, each with countless foci, degrees and rival interpretations. Rawls may see such values as mere lifestyle preferences, choices that his liberalism makes possible. But for those who make aestheticism, dan dyism, or eroticism, paramount, even above liberty, what is deemed choice worthy is not a lifestyle but a life. Is it right even to con cede the letter J to Rawls, when the Jains, the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Jews are not allowed toframe a way of life but only to take their orderly places within the system Rawls's choosers have established? Many people in the course of history have spumed Patrick Henry's noble thought (and Nathan Hale's noble gesture) by preferring life to liberty. Many have traded liberty for security-often in the 1950s bourgeois sense. Many still do. Others have sacrificed life or liberty for the sake of their children, or for reputation, comradeship, or a cause. Rawls can say that his founders privilege liberty pre cisely so that they can remain free to choose among the many values they may confront. He can even say that goods are valued (at least in part) for making choices feasible. But those who sacrifice their own interests for those of others, or for a principle, or in defense of symbols or ideas they deem holy, do not fit well into the model of rational choice that structures Rawls's argument. And how is sheer rationality supposed to set liberty above all other goods when a chooser who knew his preferences might have valued honor or national pride ahead of liberty? As Thomas Nagel puts it, "Why should the parties in the original position be prepared to commit themselves to principles that may frustrate or contravene their deepest convictions, just because they are deprived of knowledge of those convictions?"'16 What Rawls wishes to do ... is to provide an Archimedian point, as he calls it, from which choice is possible without unfairness to any of the fuller conceptions of the good that lead people to differ. A theory of the good is pre supposed, but it is ostensibly neutral between divergent particular conceptions, and supplies a least common denominator on which a choice in the original position can be based without unfairness to any of the parties.'7 And yet, as Nagel argues, Rawls's version of neutrality stands as much in need of jus tification as any other value."8 Rawls thinks justice, of his sort, uncontroversial in ways that other goods are not. But "the suppres sion of knowledge required" to achieve the unanimity Rawls seeks at the founding of a just society does not affect all choosers sym metrically. It is unfair, in particular, to those who hold a good life to be readily achievable only in certain well-defined types of social structure, or only in a society that works concertedly for the realization of certain higher human capacities and the suppression of baser</page><page sequence="5">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 85 ones, or only given certain types of economic relations. 19 One effect is to discount "conceptions of the good that depend heavily on the relation between one's own position and that of oth ers."20 Rawls will worry about the harm some practices might have on the self-esteem of prospective citizens in his projected regime. But practices that might enhance their self esteem find no similar concern. For the veil of ignorance, as Rawls weaves it, screens (until some later time, to be pursued by pri vate means) the myriad paths of excellence so central to human motivation-whether the excellence in question (the merit, fame, skill, or holiness to be pursued) is a personal goal or an aspiration for one's offspring, or even for unknown and unnamed compatriots, or the human race. The bias is invisible to Rawls, since he projects his own assumptions about equality and invidiousness onto the rationality of his primary choosers. So even neutrality, in Rawls's scheme, is not neutral. Nor is liberty, or reason. What counts as reason here is flexibility. That cre ates an interesting iridescence, as the colors of liberty shift from the game theorist's choice about making choices to the nobler principle that men are sometimes asked to die for-and may choose to give their lives for-the liberty that ranks higher not in order of abstraction but in substantive worth, enriched and inter preted by the image and content of the life its exercise will purchase. There does seem to be something of a bait-and-switch at work here, between the decision theorist's liberty of Rawls's premise and the lexically privileged liberty of his conclusion. We do see what Rawls is after: No one, he hopes, will be trapped by untutored choices. But there is one exception: Every one of Rawls's choosers is trapped in a liberal soci ety. There is no value to which liberty itself can be sacrificed. That's a welcome outcome for many, perhaps most of us, depending on what exactly liberty turns out to mean. But it's not the choice of others, who might prefer discipline or duty. Rawls leaves such persons free to choose their own way within the so ciety that (ex hypothesi) they have chosen. But they are not free to construct a value system for themselves. But isn't it in the act of setting our own priorities, deciding what to value, that we are at our most fully human and our most fully free? There's a paradox in Rawls's argument here: By making liberty paramount, he's recognized the human need to build a value system for oneself, much as every human builds a language system in the dialectic between emerging personhood and one's social and cultural environment. But he has closed, in some cases permanently, some of the choices that a chooser might have valued. It might be said that the society extruded from Rawls's thought experiment is too va nilla. But that criticism, helpful in one way, is misleading in another. It's misleading because vanilla is a flavor, not neutral or transparent, as Rawls presumes his model regime to be. Indeed, some of what Rawls's social con tractors might opt for can be pretty florid, not bland at all. Do Rawls's choosers allow group marriage or group sex, for example? Some people make that a basic part of liberty. Others judge it degrading, meretricious and exploitative. Here the imagery of flavors can be helpful: Liberty comes in many savors. The idea needs to be interpreted before we can say just where to place it in our priorities. But that's the work of culture, just the sort of backgrounding and heritage that the veil of ignorance was meant to abstract from. I'm interested in cultures-intellectually, because their protean diversity and change ability can test and teach our more abstract, decontextualized value suppositions; and morally, because cultures articulate the values we live by, not just the ones we talk about. I'm particularly interested, as a participant and an exponent, in exploring and defining the cul</page><page sequence="6">86 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY ture I've called Mosaic Liberalism, because I find in that heritage some very concrete ways of celebrating and protecting the human person. Liberty is clearly a part of that cul ture, not alien to it. But liberty in the abstract does look a little too pale to offer the kind of protections I think persons need to thrive and flourish. Liberty in the abstract doesn't tell me whether incest is a sound or unsound human choice. But almost all human cultures do. And the biblical tradition does, with particular viv idness, when it draws a penumbra of privacy around the human person, creating a zone of protection in which an emergent personality, much invested in an emergent sexuality, can take shape and seek self-definition. Liberty in the abstract doesn't tell me that I have a sacred obligation to treat my fellow human being with the same regard that I would hope others would accord to me. Mosaic liberal ism, and its daughter traditions, do espouse that ideal, and they seek to institute it in the formation of character and the construction of laws and institutions, not excluding some of the institutions that Rawls ascribes, I think wishfully, to the game theoretic choices of his mythic, primal choosers.2" When Rawls privileges his idea of liberty, even over equality, that ranking is treated as an entailment of rationality itself. So ratio nality has been assigned a material content. Sheer instrumental reason would know noth ing and care less for the values Rawls's model makes paramount. It would not know whether to prefer flexibility and social mobility to stability and generational continuity. It's only by equivocating on 'reason,' taking it now in an abstract and later in a more concrete sense, infused with his own preferences, that Rawls can move his blindfolded manikins from sheer self-interest to a selfless dedication to liberty as a principle, and on to equality as liberty's servant. How else, if not by sheer projection, swathed in the name of rationality, could Rawls expect to know what might be chosen behind the veil of ignorance? Does liberty tell us whether Roe v. Wade should be upheld, overturned, or qualified? Whether gay marriage should be counte nanced by the state? I'd argue that it answers such questions only under specific, histori cally and culturally conditioned interpreta tions. That was true, we need to recall, even of the far more central civil rights abridged by the Dred Scott decision or the "separate but equal rulings" that preceded Brown v. Board of Education. The Torah knows how to rule on the question of fugitive slaves: They are not to be returned (Deuteronomy 23:16). It does not need to ask, as Taney's court was asked, whether a slave's deserts give him legal standing. It does not hesitate to ban the shunning of Egyptians, and gives, as its reason: "because you were a stranger in his land" (Deuteronomy 23:8). In more formal terms, that would be a non sequitur. It needs the context of an ethos to become an argument. In one such context, the ethos of pride and self-assertion, just the opposite inference would be made. But in a moral context anchored in regard for the human person, the argument goes through and is generalized and enlarged: When a stranger sojourneth with you in your land, you shall not wrong him (lo' tonu 'oto). As the homeborn shall the stranger be who sojourneth with you. Thou shalt love him as thyself. For you were strangers in the land of Egypt. (Leviticus 19:33; cf. Exodus 22:20, 23:9, Deuteronomy 27:19) The reference here is historical, at once citing and framing cultural norms, dissolving doubt and ambiguity. But Dred Scott and Plessy v Ferguson were both argued and decided on libertarian grounds, informed by presump tions within the culture of the justices and the Court, presumptions not fully explicit in the rulings, as to the relative standing of property rights and states rights vis a vis mere claims in the name of equality, human dignity, and indeed, civil standing.</page><page sequence="7">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 87 Individuals and cultures have set quite a variety of goods high in the constellation of values. Whole lives and cultures may look at times as if built around pursuit of one or two of these, much as Plato pictures Cretan laws as designed for war (Laws I 625-26). Think of Che Guevara's leaving Cuba in search of perpetual revolution.22 Would that quest seem irrational from behind a veil of ignorance? Che and his ilk might not sit down to draw up plans of the sort that Rawls's choosers proj ect. But Che and others like him are always making plans, and even laws. It's just the Rawlsian "once for all" that they reject. The constant for them is revolution, and when the patina wears off the revolutionary icon, and the charisma that grows out of the barrel of an AK-47 is routinized, what results is the Mexi can oxymoron, institutional revolution. But that sort of corruption is not the rebels' goal. They value instability. Even Jefferson spoke fondly, albeit not presciently, of the need for blood to water liberty's tree. Evidently there's more than one idea of rationality. History itself may educate that notion-as it taught Hobbes and Thucydides in one way, Burke and John Quincy Adams in another, Robespi erre in a third, Emma Goldman in a fourth. But without history, the names for liberty in any language are just words. Did Aristotle give equality the same weight Rawls did? Did Hume, when he called the pursuit of equality "extremely pernicious"?23 Aristotle saw reciprocity as a basic political need.24 But understanding was the aim of life, a good in itself and a guide to reasoned living. And the life of reason, as he saw it, demands a leisure that only slaves make possible. Aristotle clearly prefers a world where some are slaves, that others may live fully human lives, to a world where all must descend to menial endeavors. Automata, he reasons, would obviate that hard choice. But these he does not have, and the sabbatarian plan, that all should enjoy some modicum of peace and contemplation, is foreign to him. I say that Sabbaths humanize and can even divinize our lives.25 Rawls would find their institution parochial, and its enforcement, a violation of basic liberties. So which does reason deem more basic, the right to rest or the right to self-exploitation? Rawls is ill equipt to answer such a question, and he has the same problem when facing Aristotle. Is Aristotle irrational because his values about freedom and slavery sort out differently from ours? That's a strange call. A pretty heavy charge for the skinny notion of rationality we started out with. We should differ with Aristotle about slavery. But when we do, I think it's over our priorities, not his rationality. We need to have a notion of the inestimable worth and dignity of the human person. But that is not provided by an abstract idea of liberty. On the contrary, it's part of what that idea is abstractedfrom. It's just the sort of thing that Rawls would like to get away from. Like his positivist predecessors, he still deems any notion of a human telos, no matter how open ended, parochial, metaphysical, biased, religious, prejudicial-bad ethics rooted in bad anthro pology. And why is the anthropology bad? Because it's normative, not value free. All contextually embedded norms, it is assumed, all norms anchored in positive ideas about the ultimate character of things or persons, God or nature, are biased. But clearly it's a mistake to ban or block from our normative, formative ethical and constitutional discourse all talk of human nature and its manifold potentials. If we legislate, it's for human beings, not abstract algorithms, even if they are said to dictate specific sorts of abstract choices. That's why I see wisdom, in the Torah's opening its legislative narrative with a cosmological prelude that views creation as a good in itself and a gift to humankind, and that boldly addresses individuals of the two human sexes, to instruct them (Genesis 2:18-24) that they are not alien to each other,</page><page sequence="8">88 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY but of one flesh and meant to be loyal to each other, even above loyalties to parents. Culture counts, and not least when it comes to norms about gender and the family. Why, as the late Susan Okin asked, and as Jane English asked before her, does the rational ity of the choosers in Rawls's original posi tion fail to penetrate to the inner workings of the family, to demand sufficient justice there, when the ground rules of civic life are marked out?26 Are familial relations somehow less than basic? The classic assumption of (secular) liberalism has long been that marital and filial relations lay a cultural veneer over the tacit dependencies and explicit contracts that structure human interactions-which are thus construed, whiggishly, in commercial and civic terms. The familial is private, and therefore (so the notion goes), no proper sphere for the purview of public policy. As Jean Elshtain writes: By failing to come up with a vocabulary rich enough to account for the centrality of the social relationships of the family, even as they "depoliticized" these relationships, the think ers within the liberal tradition adopted a set of assumptions which required the "setting aside of the fundamental facts of birth, childhood, parenthood, old age, and death."27 The outlook Elshtain calls liberal here is very much that of Rawls. But it is hardly a dictate of uninstructed reason.28 I think the humanistic traditions of monotheism, which underwrite the liberal dispensation (even when elided by it), touch a deeper sinew of the truth. Their rival premise is that the family is molecular to any social structure. So the protection of privacy and of emergent personality, afforded, say, by laws against incest (which classical liberalism has such difficulty justifying, or even explaining), far from being merely ornamental, is critical to the construction of the very personhood upon which any liberal society depends for its life29-critical even to the primacy of dignity (without which liberty is an empty sham). If the veil of ignorance obscures the parameters by which Rawls's choosers will define the sanctity of marriage and mark out the boundaries of equity and excess between partners, if it does not identify what counts as a person, let alone create a penumbra of presumptions to protect and define personal dignity, it has not afforded the tools needed to conceptualize liberty, let alone exercise it. But it can allow for such determinations only by permitting some light from outside sources, colored in various ways, to penetrate the fabric of the veil. In that case, the rationality is no mere formal exercise of self-regard ing choice but the work of a material value scheme infused with higher notions of choice and self and dignity than formal rationality unaided can afford. One chink in Rawls'armor, then, was the sense that he had freighted his idea of ratio nality with the very principles it was meant to yield, while clutching and stretching the veil of ignorance, to exclude unwanted values. But beyond this, the Rawlsian virtual contract, like any contract, tends to slight the many interests that might be underrated by its sig natories: Future generations and the unborn, the comatose and gravely ill or compromised, foreigners and would be immigrants, outlaws, outsiders, and outliers. The compactors might pledge to guard such interests and sincerely mean to. But the premise does not demand that of them, and it's hardly clear that the veil allows them the empathy that would demand. Do they even know what their attitudes will be about promise keeping-let alone about outsiders, infants, or the unborn? What about animals and plants-individu als, species, and ecosystems? Rawls comes to expect his choosers to safeguard such things. His argument: The protection of territory and its environmental integrity, in perpetuity, is the real reason for the institution of property. Rawlsian choosers would know that owner less land or goods will only deteriorate.30 So the veil of ignorance is sheer enough for them</page><page sequence="9">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 89 to read the pages of Garrett Hardin's "Trag edy of the Commons" through its tissue. But that yields only instrumental values. What about intrinsic worth? And what about the disputes between those who give primacy to sentience versus those put the highest store in biodiversity? Can that be negotiated behind a veil of ignorance?3" Rawls thinks he knows what rationality would fix as a basic starting point for a so ciety. But even in the few decades since his first sketch, popular attitudes have shifted and diverged widely. On almost any issue, some have found Rawls's minima far too demand ing; others, far too slight. As his book aged, its scheme began to look more parochial and less like a theory or anything normative at all, more like a position paper from a narrowly constructed "we" with only the blurriest awareness of ideals beyond their own. Pluralism is what many critics felt Rawls had slighted, diversity in the values that might evoke human energies, the plethora of claims above, beneath and beyond those that the planners of his embryo Republic made paramount. Pressed by feminists and communitarians, ecologists and libertar ians, Rawls added caveats and codicils to his model, transforming his Lockean lean-to into a cavernous train station. In Political Liberalism he sought to acknowledge the role of communities and subcultures, while assuring the secularity of his state by build ing secularism into its ethos. He banned from all public deliberations in a democracy any appeal to religious or metaphysical values or ideas-the two kinds strapped together under the rubric of comprehensive doctrines.32 Lib eralism, of course, was nothing of the kind, as if it bore not a single gene or meme from its past, had never been a half-secularized ideal or harbored any project of becoming an all embracing way of life.33 Here Rawls's liberalism bites its tail, promulgating, in the name of liberty, a rule as brittle and repressive as any proposed by the prelates and princes of the seventeenth century. The patent target of Rawls's stric tures was religious opposition to abortion. But his general ban on public discourse that makes any appeal to comprehensive doctrines sweeps up many an act of advocacy for causes Rawls might have found more sympathetic. By a Pickwickian fiat he assigns the word 'political' exclusively to the secular dimen sions of civic life. Yet many a civic ideal springs from a "comprehensive doctrine." Not least, the broad, humanistic idea of hu manity itself, which informs the notion of human flourishing with affirmations of the preciousness of human beings and their plans and projects. The Mosaic Liberalism of which I have written is just one tile in the world's mosaic of essays at the construction of such a humanistic culture. Its pluralist credentials are of long standing and hard won.34 Before signing on to Rawls's strictures we need to ask ourselves whether we are content that the only arguments to be pled in behalf of public libraries, public education, public parks, or public art must appeal to purely instrumental goods. Good schools, on that account, make good citizens or useful em ployees. Good education is not their goal. Still less is fostering the emergence of good persons, free and thoughtful, independent minded, sensitive human beings. That's too parochial. Can liberals consistently reject the Aristo telian idea, taken up by many religions and ideologies, that public institutions exist for the humanization of human life? Doesn't rejection of that widely shared (but hardly a priori) idea have the effect of privatizing every effort toward the public good? Without some idea of human worth and some way of fleshing out that idea with open-minded, open-ended visions of the varieties of hu man fulfillment, isn't public policy at risk of laying all the good that states and societies can achieve at the feet of some diffuse or impersonal end, like profit-if it does not</page><page sequence="10">90 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY succumb, piecemeal, to the sensate but now sacrosanct campaigns of hucksters and dema gogues, with their glittering array of goods and services and ersatz ideals, from conquest and xenophobia, to order and eugenics? Rawls's nod toward community conjures in my mind the image of the Tongan chil dren I once saw performing dances of their archipelago. Squatting on tapa mats, they ran through the prescribed hand gestures, closely watched by their bespectacled ministers, who held well worn leatherbound Bibles in their hands. Authentic enough to be what they were, the dances kept alive no steps or body movements but seemed to echo some now forgotten ritual. They were deracinated hulas. The cultures Rawls permits, stripped of any public savor of faith or philosophy, bear the same faint if telling scent of naphtha and formaldehyde. That odor follows when Rawls moves to the international arena and proposes a new league, not of nations but of liberal and non-liberal but "decent" peoples, whose representatives come together, chattering in their many languages, bearing the trappings of their cultures, the memories and histories of national trauma-perhaps even wearing their colorful costumes-although naked of all comprehensive doctrines. The strains of Disney's "It's a Small World After All" fill the hall. The "Ode to Joy" might seem too culture-bound. The delegates crowd together, greeting one another, and trying to fathom how Poles or Hungarians, or Jews, can recall the traumas (and glories?) of their past with out thought of their religious heritage. Peoples, Rawls argues, are the proper sub jects of this new meeting, on the anniversary of the first "original position" that chalked out the plans for domestic liberal society. The participants face off, in the missionary position. The veil of ignorance unfolds once again, shrouding them from each other and even from themselves, as pious couples were once urged to place a bed sheet between them when making love, with only a narrow slit for transmittal of the requisite fluids, and mini mal exchange of passion or perception. Peoples are the constituents here rather than states, since states, Rawls argues, bear the ugly legacy of the claim to sovereignty and capricious warfare. The ghost of Clausewitz is summoned up, to warn off any lingering statists. Peoples, it seems, are like individuals, in that "they also see themselves as self-au thenticating sources of claims, and capable of taking responsibility for their ends."35 "Peoples (as opposed to states) have a definite moral nature."36 That (like the presumptive innocence of the accused), would seem to make peoples innocent, where states are not. Yet any moral nature has at least two sides: Peoples can rise up on their hind legs and af firm their sovereignty. The Lockean model of political legitimation is founded on that fact. And peoples too can commit grave wrongs and crimes, including genocide, as the case of the Hutus, among many others, so hid eously attests.37 As George Schultz recently reminded us, it was the breakdown of the state that loosed the warlords of Somalia and Afghanistan. And al-Qa'ida hatches its acts of ethnic and sectarian hatred in the pacific spaces created by the civility of the states it seeks to infest and destroy; but it operates overtly in the crannies and potholes of the state system.38 Rawls is anthropomorphic and romantic about peoples, assigning them not only cultures and languages but personalities and beliefs.39 He apologizes for ignoring the most salient fact about the geography of peoples today, their dispersion in a thousand places and circumstances. Calling his more homo geneous images a simplification needed for the sake of analysis, he follows Mazzini's wishful ethnography, giving each people its land, large or small, rich or poor in resources and population-as if no people had ever been exiled or dispossessed.</page><page sequence="11">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 91 The veil of ignorance now casts its pall over these peoples' representatives (no talk of how they are chosen, just of their faithfulness to the abstract interests of their constituents), and the contractual work of the original posi tion is recycled, inter-ethnically. Their rules of engagement are laid out in ignorance of which land and resources each people will receive. No thought here of any linkage of a people to its land or soil-Finland or the Balkans, Armenia, Uganda, Birobidzhan, all distributed by lot. Recall those board games of diplomacy that political science students used to play, before computer games shifted the emphasis from strategy to speed. But now the object of the game, at least for Rawls, is to show his critics that liberal societies can live in peace, first with one another and then with non-liberal ones. Not that the millennium has come. Rather the aim is to show that Rawls has not utterly neglected to look beyond the borders of a single state or to consider ideals and ways of life quite different from those he held self-evident in the original original position. Rawls's thesis, then, is self-regard ing: that he has made room for what he calls "a reasonable pluralism." Rawls evinces earnestness and tests the re alism of his model repeatedly by challenging his reader to see that the terms on offer are "what you and I, here and now" would accept as fair.40 One can almost hear the challenge issued, in lecture or tutorial. The aim is to situate the scheme in our actual world. But as the stipulations mount up, we are hemmed in by what proves to be a mathematical model, the facts governed increasingly by ad hoc postulates. Rawls labels his schematic world "a realistic utopia"-realistic because it has workable rules and peoples stably committed to the standards they grew up with; utopian, because the primacy of rights is preserved and everyone gets the goods necessary for effective exercise of those rights. By utopian, then, Rawls means ideal. But if we turn to a more classic definition, Spinoza's thesis (1TP I 1) that a system is utopian if it presupposes the transformation of human nature, we have to ask how Rawls knows that generations will grow up loyal to the values they were raised in, when history so often frustrates that hope-when even Plato, sometimes read as the arch-utopian, finds seeds of instability within his own Republic, not in its principles of course, but in the ac cidents of history that permit their decay?4' How can Rawls know that his world is stable, if not by fiat?42 And if he can gain stability, satisfaction and homogeneity, by postulate, why not world peace as well? Rawls's intent is to derive the reign of peace from the satisfaction that the peoples in his projected Society of Peoples will feel in the arrangements he proposes: The idea of a reasonably just society of well-or dered peoples will not have an important place in a theory of international politics until such peoples exist and have learned to coordinate the actions of their governments in wider forms of political, economic and social cooperation. Thus the postulate. But, from that, utopia: When that happens, as I believe, following Kant, it will, the society of these peoples will form a group of satisfied peoples. As I shall maintain, in view of their fundamental interests being satisfied, they will have no reason to go to war with one another. The familiar motives for war would be absent: such peoples do not seek to convert others to their religions, nor to conquer greater territory, nor to wield political power over another people.43 That sounds nice. But to Rawls's interlocutors it raised the specter of Auschwitz.44 Why so? Well, in part, perhaps, because Germany was on the mend, a rising democratic, constitu tional society, when its people turned to Hitler as their savior and made the Jewish people the race enemy, a threat to the Volk and to the human race at large, to be obliterated at all costs. Can we safely say that democracies do not make war when the imperial democracies</page><page sequence="12">92 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY of ancient Athens and modern Britain set out so doggedly for hegemony-when John Stuart Mill made himself an apologist for the Opium War? Can we honestly say that satis fied peoples do not make war when Belgium raped the Congo, when our own United States made war with Mexico and Spain, when a burgeoning China swallowed Tibet, when Italy overran Ethiopia, and a modernizing Japan conquered Manchuria and made com mon cause with the Axis?45 To the living memory of the Holocaust, Rawls responds not as if he saw a challenge to moral complacency but as if the chal lenge were purely to his rhetoric. He pays lip service to the uniqueness of the Shoah,46 an empty gesture as one looks back over the century of Armenian, Serbian, Cambodian, and Rwandan genocides-as empty as the perfunctory nod in the direction of the Mid dle Passage in Rawls's mention of historic travails.47 The real problem with Rawls's optimism here is that his postulate stands too close to the posits it is built on. But he masks that logical difficulty in the fire and smoke of a two-page tirade against religion: Hitler used religion in his war against the Jews and made religious claims for the ultimacy of his Reich. So the fault lay not in the liberal regime on whose carcass he feasted, nor in the German people who elected him and cheered him, and followed his orders into battle, nor in the league of satisfied nations that made their separate peace and acquiesced in Hitler's gobbling of lesser nations as he led a prosperous, learned, industrial, and cultured society into the abyss of barbarism. No, the fault lay in religion. Yet appeals to religion were just one of Hitler's many political tools. Stalin, who killed millions more than Hitler did, was no friend of religion, but its bitter, if pragmatic, enemy. And the Cambodians perpetrated a self-genocide not yet brought to justice-if there could ever be such a judg ment-with no color of religion, unless the term is defined persuasively to make any act of ultimate brutality religious for the zeal brought to the slaughter. But that would make Rawls's charge tautologous, again betraying the formalism of his argument. The facts of history do not support Rawls's realist pretensions. On the contrary. Stalin made his own separate peace with Hitler, shared with him in dismembering Poland, and was ready to keep the peace, had Hitler not invaded. Chamberlain was eager to look away, in the name of peace, in denial of the Nazi menace, and in sympathy with its seeming counterweight to Bolshevism. The Austrians, as a people, welcomed Hitler. The French, in large numbers, collaborated with him. Japan and Italy rushed to his side, anticipating spoils they did not need. Spain, a poorer and more pious country, sat out the war-and missed the reconstruction. Rawls's fulminations against religion allow him to vent and blow off steam. But the smokescreen is too thin and wispy to erase the charge that his promises of peace are sustained only by a tissue of wishes. He envisions a world rebuilt to his design, where war, starvation, oppression, genocide, and persecution have vanished at a wave of the philosopher's wand. That world is the work of arbitrary postulates and their posited effects. But it would take a more astute political scientist and a wiser and more catholic statesman than Rawls to produce anything like the promised reality. The real test Rawls gives his model, beyond his tutorial challenge, is his vignette of a Mus lim people which he names Kazanistan: This people48 satisfies the criteria for decent hierarchical peoples I set forth: Kazanistan is not aggressive against other peoples and accepts and follows the Law of Peoples; it honors and respects human rights; and its basic structure contains a decent consultation hierarchy.49 Shades of the Woody Allen character who goes hunting for the pro-peace, pro-choice branch of the Catholic Church. Would a prim er of Islamic theology be relevant here?</page><page sequence="13">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 93 I've devoted over forty years to the study of Islam, as it is, as it has been, and as its most ardent followers have wished it to be. I've particularly tracked the philosophers, scientists, and humanists of Islam who have struggled to give definition and critical cred ibility to the Islamic legacy. In chronicling some of their finest works, my hope in part has been that non-Muslims will see a more open face of Islamic culture than militants, extremists, and irredentists have shown. And in part it has been that greater access to their own tradition's riches will inspire and empower committed Muslims to build on the achievements of some of the greatest minds and souls the world has known.50 My hope has been and remains that Islam will be one of the tesserae in that mosaic of human, humane, and humanistic civilizations. But much work needs to be done on that front, by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. One cannot misrepresent the facts. Islamic theol ogy and legal theory do not join together in clear and unison to acknowledge the ultimacy of secular authority and do not promote the treatment of other faiths with the honor and respect Rawls hopes for. That is the ideal that Abdulaziz Sachedina has argued for, finding firm footings for constitutional democracy, pluralism, and a secular state in the founding documents of Islam.5" But traditional Islam has not abandoned the expansionism and tri umphalism linked with the idea of jihad, and the Islamic militants who have pushed those values to the extreme have found widespread sympathy among the Muslim masses and sup port among the wealthy and powerful.52 Generically jihad means "concerted effort" or "struggle." The greater jihad, in the spiritu al sources, is the struggle for self-mastery. But that usage is metaphoric, like the secularized metaphoric usage of "crusade" in the West. Construed as an obligation of Islamic law, jihad is a corollary of Islamic universality. It means warfare in behalf of Islam. Christians, Jews, and some other groups are to be toler ated in Muslim domains, although subject to special imposts and disabilities, since the Qur'an pretty clearly seems to demand their subjugation and abasement: Do battle with those People of the Book who believe not in God and the Last Day and forbid not what God and his Messenger have forbidden and follow not the true religion-until they pay the tribute tax out of hand and are humbled. The Jews call Uzayr (Ezra) God's son, and the Christians call Christ God's son, their words, imitating the words of the unbelievers of old. God slay them! They are utterly perverse. (Qur'an 9:29-30) Ideally, such commands to warfare and the curses that go with them would be histori cized, set into the context of long bygone battles and pogroms. Ideally the call to struggle would be sublimated, understood spiritually, as it has often been understood in Sufi traditions, as an effort to overcome one's own baser impulses. Ideally the role and standing of non-Muslims would be rethought, and the concept of the dhimmis, the protected but clearly subordinate status assigned to subject populations of tolerated monotheistic minority communities would be given an honorable burial. But these are tasks for Muslim jurists and theologians, as is the work of reconceptualizing the invidious tribute tax and the Qur'anic pronouncement that God made Jews and Christians into apes and swine (5:60; cf. 2:65, 7:166). Part of what today's Muslim theologians and jurists must confront is the fact that the classical norms deny even the alternative of the tribute tax to most pagans-although there were important historical exceptions to the rule, in the case, for example, of the so-called Sabians. But re vised versions of these concepts have not yet been widely adopted by the Muslim masses or elites. And jihad, as framed in the sources, proclaimed by many a Muslim jurist today, and sustained by many a donor, public and private, has yet to be revised to the standards Rawls hoped for.</page><page sequence="14">94 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY All but two rather minor Sharia authorities of the classic age held jihad to be aggressive and expansionist. One of those two excep tions, a jurist named al-Thawri, softened the obligation of aggressive warfare in behalf of Islam to a recommendation; another, the celebrated essayist al-Jahiz, followed him. The modernist Ahmadiyya sect reject jihad, as do Bahais. But orthodox Muslims deem the Ahmadiyya heretics and the Bahais infidels and apostates. The former are persecuted; and in Iran Bahais have been executed for their faith as recently as 1998. In the Sharia jihad is a public obligation (fard kifaya), by which the Islamic integrity of a state is judged-although most Shiites (except the Zaydis) suspend the prosecution ofjihad until apocalyptic times. The religious obligation becomes personal (fard ayn) when a Muslim population reaches the critical mass necessary to prosecute the war, as ordained by the proper authorities. There is an open ing for mitigation of these rules, should vic tory be impossible. So one could envision a Muslim polity foreswearing jihad de facto, if it deemed world domination impracticable in a global society that is perforce diverse. But that decision would be open to rebuke and even reprisal from more zealous quarters. In theory, as Tyan writes, [t]he duty of the djihad exists as long as the universal domination of Islam has not been at tained. "Until the day of the resurrection," and "Until the end of the world," say the maxims. Peace with non-Muslim nations is, therefore, a provisional state of affairs only. And summing up: The djihad has principally an offensive char acter... There is at the present time a thesis, of a wholly apologetic character, according to which Islam relies for its expansion exclusively upon persuasion and other peaceful means, and the djihad is only authorized in cases of "self defense" and of "support owed to a defenceless ally or brother." Disregarding entirely the pre vious doctrine and historical tradition, as well as the texts of the Qur' n and the sunna on the basis of which it was formulated, but claiming, even so, to remain within the bounds of strict orthodoxy, this thesis takes into account only those early texts which state the contrary.53 Such heterodoxy, of course, is welcome, when it maps public policy and is not sheer window dressing. Perhaps in time the work of Muslim jurists and theologians will shift the ground of orthodoxy. That will mean what the jurists call (in language tellingly cognate with the word jihad) reopening the gates of ijtihad, legal creativity, making rather than following all too familiar historical precedent. But reform is not accomplished by apologet ics any more than by well wishing bystanders. It demands the efforts (and self-mastery) of Muslims whose learning and commitment earn them recognition as authorities. I am privileged to know a few such scholars. They do not live for the most part in countries with a majority Muslim population, and they com mand no mass following. Perhaps one day their time will come, but Islam as yet has no Erasmus or Thomas More.s4 So is Kazanistan faithful to the ideals of its Muslim populace, to their historic vision and sense of mission? Does it exact the statutory Sharia penalties on the bodies of thieves, adulterers, homosexuals, and fornicators? Does its commitment to human rights and gender equity part company with the Prophet on polygamy, and with widespread and au thoritative understandings of the sunnah on cliterodectomy, purdah, and the veil? Are its people Muslims only in faith-a strange locution in Islamic parlance?55 Is their Islam recognizable by any other Muslim populace? Or is it just another fictive construct; and is Kazanistan one of those children's dioramas, like "Christmas around the World" that shows how Christmas is celebrated in Turkey, Israel, Japan, and China? "If all societies were required to be lib eral," Rawls writes, "then the idea of po litical liberalism would fail to express due</page><page sequence="15">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 95 toleration."56 Wouldn't that be the height of illiberality? The question is, how far can Rawls's liberal society go in tolerating non liberal societies, before imposing sanctions to push for a change in their ways? Here Rawls faces a dilemma, much like the one he faced (or failed to face) with his hands off policy towards the family, only now writ large: If other societies choose to violate our principles, do we interfere or let them be? Is it more illiberal to interfere or to abdicate responsibility? That, perhaps, is the deepest question Rawls's life's work on justice failed to address: the classic question of the rights of the individual vis 'a vis the group, and echo ing that, of groups vis a vis society at large. Turning from the parochial or domestic to the international sphere does not obviate but only intensifies such questions: If oppression or even neglect by states or by communities bleeds through the protective membranes of individuality or privacy, group autonomy or national sovereignty, when does the flow of blood or suffering become sufficient morally to demand action to stanch it-when, and by whom may or must it be stanched. The veil of ignorance does not answer that question but only obscures it. And I will not attempt a comprehensive answer here. I will only say that there are human needs and rights which the countervailing concern of respect for cultural autonomy or national sovereignty, or even (as with Rawls) minimal or presump tive "decency" are do not permit us to leave untended. The default option, de facto, among liberal as among other states-and peoples-not an entailment of liberalism but a pragmatic choice, is too often a laisser faire that finds (selective) exceptions to its hands-off rule when the abuses start looking too outrageous. But the pragmatic barriers to interference, even domestically, have been pretty high. And internationally (unless national sovereignty or self-interest was at stake) they've been even higher. The United States did not act against slavery domestically until secession had led to war. We still do next to nothing about slavery overseas. We did nothing to stop the Holocaust but closed our doors to the refugees and sloughed off the Nazi enormity against humanity as an internal German mat ter-although the mass killing of Jews began in countries Hitler had invaded. Indeed, we did not enter the war when Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, or Britain was attacked but only after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Sov ereignty gave a free pass to genocide. Rawls believes he knows how to identify "decent non-liberal peoples." Such peoples would respect human rights. Their states would be open to consultation (albeit hier archical rather than democratic, as in liberal societies). Their governments would accept dissent and reply pertinently and respectfully to queries about the law as interpreted by the judiciary. "Dissenters may not be dismissed as simply incompetent or lacking in under standing."57 A decent hierarchical society, like a liberal society, would be "well ordered," but on "associationist" or corporate lines. It is "decent" in that it forswears aggressive aims and oppressive means,58 secures hu man rights for all its members (life, liberty, equality before the law), imposes bona fide duties on its people (as members of groups), and can justify a sincere belief by judges and other officials that the law aims for a common good. It is not a slave society. But it is not individualist. It is communal (even fascist or soviet?) in organization. Class or clan or caste, confession or sect, union, party, or firm, tribe or ethnic group have their spokesmen in the corridors and forums of power, each representing the interests of his constituents as he sees those interests. How exactly this comports with the sustenance of human rights (especially for equal opportu nity) is not made exactly clear. Hierarchical societies, after all, are notoriously riven with nepotism, cronyism, special preferments, and the kind of sexism that feminists call</page><page sequence="16">96 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY patriarchy. Oppression may be subtler and ag gression more oblique than Rawls's standards will detect. But he hopes he has sketched a system that would relax the tension between the liberal impulse to intervene when human rights are trodden underfoot and the counter vailing impulse to let things go, so often and so strongly seconded by pragmatic interests in the way of trade (cheap labor and natural resources, ready markets, lax environmental, safety or child labor standards) and eagerness to avoid foreign entanglements (isolationism, pacifism, apathy toward the alien other). Mo saic liberalism bridles at such concessions, as does any authentic liberalism. In all Rawls has used the fiction of the original position three times: first to found the liberal society of his preference, then to relate to one another the societies he calls liberal, and finally to relate those societies to "decent," non-liberal ones.59 What keeps the non-liberal societies stable and their members loyal is a shared commitment to common goals or distinctive priorities that all can see pursued by the local institutions. Group representation, Rawls reasons, would func tion here, on Hegel's principles, to broaden the people's interests beyond their atomic individuality.60 So even a state religion might wield ultimate authority in some spheres. But not in foreign relations, nor domestically if that breached freedom of conscience. Does this mean that special imposts and imposi tions will not be levied from non-adherents of the state religion? that its clergy will not be privileged? that theologians and canon jurists who dispute its precepts will not be defrocked or disempowered-forced to dissolve their marriages, as has been done in Egypt to a dissenting Islamic scholar? Does it mean that no protest will be heard in persecuted minorities' behalf from states abroad? Rawls waffles. His basic answer is that a reasonable state need not befully reasonable, as perfect freedom of conscience might require.6' In Kazanistan, he tells us (while conceding that it does not exist), the law does not separate "church" from state. Only Muslims may hold higher office, although (contrary to traditional Islamic practice) non-Muslims do serve in the military, even as high officers. By sustaining basic human rights-corpo rate consultation, reforms for women-even special representation for formerly oppressed groups-shunning mass murder, slavery and serfdom, Kazanistan merits toleration by liberal societies worldwide. Can a society that privileges one confession and affords only corporate representation ef fectively guarantee even these rights? Rawls replies that ex hypothesi Kazanistan can.62 So the weight of history and culture do not destabilize the model. At stake is hypothetical acceptance of a hypothetical society, differ ent from Rawls's own ideal, but not enough to arouse deep concerns-at least not among the hypothetical subscribers to his three hy pothetical agreements. What exactly have they agreed to toler ate? Discrimination, certainly. Principle is squeezed to create the space Rawls wants to open, between the fully reasonable and the fully unreasonable. That can mean over looking quite an array of abuses. The veil of ignorance may have blocked the view. So casuistry is left to decide what to say or do about the lax pursuit of honor killings, dowry murders, loan sharking, child marriage, child prostitution, procurement, drug trafficking, or corporate sponsorship of terrorism. Is a society "decent" when it does not make war but uses its embassies to sponsor mosques and preachers who advocate the destruction of all secular and non-Muslim governments? From Bangkok to Bangladesh, Colombia, Afghani stan, China, Japan, Ireland, Honduras, and Saudi Arabia, none of this is mere theory. In countenancing an established religion, Rawls asks only that any decent society respect freedom of conscience enough to al low emigration. Will that license discrimina tion, strengthen the hand of bigots, entrench</page><page sequence="17">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 97 uniformity? Will it corrupt the clerics, as religious establishment historically tends to do, degrading the national ethos in turn? A pretty high degree of homogeneity was built into Rawls's model from the outset. But given the invidiousness to be tolerated, Rawls's postulates of convenience harden into norms, ratcheting ever tighter against the rib cage of anyone who gasps for a breath of life in an open society. Time was when colonists were ready to take up arms rather than pay a few pence tax on their tea, unless their voices were to be heard. Time was when people risked and gave their lives for the right of others to sit in the front seats of a bus or learn in integrated schools, or eat at an integrated lunch counter. That was in keeping with the demands of Mosaic liberalism. But to see that we humans do gasp for breath and stretch for even a glimpse of an open society demands a pretty concrete notion of human nature. As elements in a comprehensive doctrine, such notions, it would seem, have no place in public discourse, let alone foreign policy deliberations in the imagined society Rawls built. An onlooker troubled by, say, polygamy, or arbitrary divorce, or child abuse among his neighbors had best remain silent. Decent peoples, Rawls tells us, do not tolerate outlaw states. They impose sanc tions on those who wage aggressive wars or violate basic human rights.63 But sanctions, de facto, are often political in intent and coun terproductive in effect. They are also often ineffective."' And which rights are basic is itself a delicate question-one that the people of Kazanistan might judge quite differently from their global neighbors. Respect means giving room to their standards and not press ing one's own. So does one keep quiet about forced sterilization or sex selection by abor tion or infanticide? What about the burning of churches or Jewish community centers by unknown arsonists whom the government seems powerless or unwilling to capture or to name? It's a little unclear. What about the well fed militias in Darfur, who burn and kill, rape and terrorize the members of an ethnically and credally different population, while the government of Sudan claims to know nothing of how these militias are fed and clothed and armed? Is failure to protect a helpless population from depredations or starvation a violation of their civil rights? Is passive, or acquiescent, or unacknowledged genocide again an internal matter that a lib eral society had best overlook? Which rights are basic is a question that's tough to settle without reference to some sort of "compre hensive doctrine." By wielding the lash of public opinion, Rawls hopes, the Society of Peoples will be able to create lasting peace. That lash, it seems, is spared (selectively?) for "decent peoples." But it remains a powerful deterrent: "Even outlaw regimes are not altogether in different to this kind of criticism."65 Granted. But the response is not always the desired reform. It can be disinformation, manipula tion, bribery, coopting of journalists, scholars, and opinion makers, as long practiced by the Soviets, and Mao, and mimicked by Saddam. "Gradually, over time, then," Rawls writes, "well-ordered peoples may pressure outlaw regimes to change their ways."66 Gradually. And, once these efforts fail, after millions perish, as they did in Cambodia and Rwanda, and now are perishing in their thousands in Sudan, Rawls holds in reserve the flacid rod of sanctions! If overt aggression leads to war, Rawls reasons, then (but only then) defense is jus tified, on terms that lead him to yet another abstraction or crystallization, the image of the statesman: "There is no office of states man, as there is of president, or chancellor, or prime minister. Rather, the statesman is an ideal, like that of the truthful or virtuous individual."67 Rawls explains: "The ideal of the statesman is suggested by the saying: the politician looks to the next election, the statesman to the next generation." That's</page><page sequence="18">98 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY what I call a sayism, words that sound like they're saying something because they echo profoundly, but in fact say precious little. This one (pace Rawls) might seem to leave out Lincoln, at least at certain stages in his career. But it would not exclude Mao, or Stalin, or even Hitler from the ranks of statesmen. For each of them worried little about elections but demanded sacrifices of his people and many others-always with a view to the next generation and others yet to come, far into the future. The statesman is supposed to make the heavy decisions about loosing the dogs of war, civilian casualties, and the like. A leader's standing as a statesman, then, de pends in the last analysis on later judgments, when the smoke and dust have settled and the wounded have been healed or buried. Then history is supposed to judge whether it was all worthwhile. But such judgments can rarely claim more than the benefit of hindsight. The more immediate decisions were made in the heat of battle, when some bits of information were much fresher and richer and others not yet known, but danger was pressing. Later judgments may lean toward the Wertfrei; but almost never are they dispassionate or un tinged by political persuasions, the memory of earlier or ancient battles, and the fear or yen for those yet to come. Rawls ends his discussion by turning from war to peace and the duties of liberal societies toward "burdened" societies, which lack the political culture to become well ordered.68 Aided by some good sense from Amartya Sen, which he acknowledges, he notes that not every burdened society is poor, nor ev ery well-ordered society rich. Sen finds in Bengal, Ethiopia, the Sahel, and Bangladesh that poor distribution rather than inadequate supply is the chief cause of famine. And, in keeping with the insights of Barbara Ward, whom he does not cite, Rawls argues that population pressure (he rejects the tenden tious language of "overpopulation") is best relieved by enhanced rights and educational opportunities for women.69 Generalizing, Rawls argues that any so ciety, except, perhaps, for a few "marginal cases" like the Arctic Eskimos, has sufficient resources to become well ordered: The Law of Peoples assumes that every society has in its population a sufficient array of hu man capabilities, each in sufficient number so that the society has enough potential human resources to realize just institutions.70 If so, why does Rawls's model ordain so high a degree of homogeneity in his hypothetical cultures? The idea that all cultures have the resources to generate not only change but also openness and even justice, is, I think, Rawls's really powerful positive claim, as against the relativists' notion that seems to tug at his sleeve, the notion that some societies or cul tures are ill suited for the sort of institutions that we deem just in our own case.7" But here the question returns as to who "we" are and what we want, collectively and individually, as a matter of personal choice or shared values. Rawls is naturally eager to defend his now famous theses from the charge that they are nothing more than products of cultural bias. The Law of Peoples, he insists, is not ethnocentric: We must always start from where we now are. ... The objectivity of that law surely depends not on its time, place, or culture of origin, but on whether it satisfies the criterion of reciprocity and belongs to the public reason of the Society of liberal and decent Peoples.72 This, Rawls insists, it does: "It asks of other societies only what they can reasonably grant without submitting to a position of inferior ity or domination." So reciprocity now takes the place of principle, and we can glimpse the real price Rawls pays for caricaturing religion as dogmatism and oppression: Trade relations and mutual backscratching become the guarantors of human liberty and dignity internationally. The sheer notion of rights,</page><page sequence="19">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 99 with its roots in religious tradition and meta physical reflection is too parochial, too much a part of the "quest for certainty" to continue in the role that brought the institutional pro tection of liberty to the plane of national and international law. Rawls's law of nations, he insists "does not require decent societies to abandon or modify their religious institutions and adopt liberal ones."73 Well, yes and no. Rawls expects liberal societies to find non liberal societies tolerable-but only insofar as they adopt the liberal principles he finds criti cal.74 His Kazanistan has abandoned many Islamic values, including some deemed cen tral by mainstream Muslim authorities. I do not dispute the worth of some of the reforms Rawls imagines. But many a Muslim jurist would; and some of the practices his model seems ready to overlook remain intolerable. The failure of his filter to catch them mea sures not their worth but the coarse tolerances built into the thought experiment by its rather diffuse bias in behalf of pluralism. Some practices will simply not be scrutinized. The attainment of justice, whether in Is lamic societies or elsewhere, will demand much creative work by progressive leaders and thinkers-including, of course, theo logians and philosophers-and much soul searching-from China and Myanmar to Beirut and Damascus. But, with all the good will in the world, Rawls's tolerance for cor poratism, like his intolerance for theology in public deliberations, might have the effect of impeding some of that work. The reforms Rawls posits, and others be sides, remain on the world's agenda. Some of his desiderata will remain contested or prob lematic. For learning, after all, on an intercul tural as on an interpersonal plane, is always a two-way street-or a multilane interchange. The discovery and implementation of the principles of justice is a sustained dialectic that commands the heights in human history. The dialectic is both intellectual and practical. It demands both sweat and imagination, and blood and tears. It is not the work of formal fiats, and its goal is not gained by the mere positing of its proposed conditions, along with the postulation of their adequacy. Should desirable transformations be achieved within and among the nations of the world, whether in continuity with Rawls's pieties or with others more familiar in situ, the moral acceptance won by the new societies thus brought to birth will be owing not to the catholicity of Rawls's concessions, and still less to any veil, fictive or pragmatic, but to the creativity of the leaders and thinkers of those societies, and the insight and enlightenment of their people and those with whom they interact in an increasingly interdependent world. The great weakness in Rawls's model for the relations of liberal states with hierarchi cal, burdened, and challenged societies lies in the possibility that efforts toward tact and toleration can shore up the strength and give heart to the brutality of repressive regimes. The problem is far more real in practice than in the more controlled environment of an artificial model. To espouse high ideals is a great responsibility for anyone, and all the more so for a powerful state. One always runs the risk that someone will take one's words seriously and strive to live by them. We hear now that some of the students at Tiananmen Square in 1989 were carrying copies of Rawls's A Theory of Justice when they shed their blood and risked their lives, standing unarmed before a column of tanks, building an effigy to the ideal of liberty. The cries of those courageous young Chinese were not heeded then, and have not been heeded since, as the survivors of the massacre at Tianan men continue to languish in prison, in exile, or under the watchful eye of a Communist Party that has shed all pretence of its former programs and exists now mainly to sustain its own dominance. The sacrifices of those who spent years in solitary confinement or reeducation remain, in a very practical sense,</page><page sequence="20">100 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY ignored by the world's self-proclaimed liberal democracies. As the memory of Tiananmen fades (young people in China today profess utter ignorance of the events of 1989), and networks as well as athletes let the glow of Olympic gold diffuse the images of Tibetan pain, and Bur mese jade and Sudan oil muffle the voices of suppressed and violated peoples, the United States still basks in nostalgia for the libera tive efforts of the Allies at Normandy, and the great moments when allied troops marched beneath the Arc de Triomphe and threw open the gates of the Nazi death camps. The nos talgia and pride seem undiminished (and are perhaps enhanced, being safely focused on the past) by today's self-laceration over the American initiative for the liberation of Iraq,75 and anger over the strategy of preemption. Some of the pride and some of the guilt may be exaggerated. At the very least it must be said that America was years late in answering Hitler's overt threats, years that increased war casualties and raised the civilian toll, espe cially in the death camps, many fold. It's here that Rawls's ideal of statesmanship finds its greatest pertinence. The statesman must judge what powers deserve alliance and which forces merit enmity or suspicion. She must judge where sanctions will work, and where military action might matter more, where peaceful diplomacy can achieve what war cannot, where allies count (and can be counted on) and where they would set a stumbling block in the path of peacemaking, sacrificing success, or (as at Yalta) giving over large populations and decades of slav ery for entire nations, for the preservation of an alliance. The democratic statesman must discriminate tolerable from intolerable abuses and find a way to lead a polity rightly averse to the risk of war, so as not to emulate America's empty espousal of democratic ideals for Eastern Europe in the 1940s, for East Germany, Hungary, and Poland in the 1950s, for Czechoslovakia in the 1960s-an espousal backed up, when push came to shove, mainly by hand wringing. Often the critical task for the democratic statesman in the international arena, if critical tasks have anything to do with critical moments and statesmanship has anything to do with leader ship, is to find a way of rousing a democratic polity from complacency in the assumption that the blessings of democracy are relevant only to themselves. For even more than they seek legitimacy dictators and tyrants seek, and constantly test for, acquiescence. Finding a statesman whose ideals come alive not just in prideful, periclean rhetoric but in effectual and prudent action has always been the great issue for democracies. It remains so today and will to remain so long into the future.76 Vanderbilt University NOTES My thanks to Robert Talisse, Amy Eckert, John Lachs, Henry Teloh, and Richard McGregor for their helpful suggestions. 1. Ralph Barton Perry's Our Side is Right (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1942) is a notable exception, since Perry turns his principle that value is the object of any interest into a stern condemnation of tyranny: "If 'right' is to be used as the predicate of a sentence which is true or false, then 'right' must have a meaning. In spite of the moral skepticism which has run riot in the world during the last century there is little disagreement as to what that meaning is. The right act is the act that best satisfies all claims as they are viewed by a disinterested and sympathetic bystander" (12). Totalitarian regimes are in the wrong, since they systematically deny the legitimate claims of persons. Perry forth rightly condemns moral relativism, branding the view that "all moral convictions are equally right" as a "way of weakening men's moral convictions. Liberals, he observes, are "extremely vulnerable" to the</page><page sequence="21">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 101 notion that one must "respect the other man's belief even though it be a belief in slavery and intolerance." Thus, Perry warns, "the more pure and scrupulous the liberal is the more sure can he be counted on to befriend the enemies of liberalism. And once these are morally befriended, and their code is given an equal standing with our own, it becomes ridiculous to fight them on moral grounds. There may still be other things to fight about, such as life, property, and territory, but the moral motivation is gone" (10). The "muddle," Perry writes, "For muddle it is" stems "from a failure to distinguish between a moral difference and a merely emotional difference. There is a moral difference between ourselves and the nazis because we believe that freedom is right, and they believe that slavery is right." These wise words still resonate today and apply not only to relations with the lineal descendants of the Nazis. 2. See Spinoza, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus 5.7, trans. Samuel Shirley in the Complete Works (Indianapolis: Hackett, 2002), p. 700. 3. See L. E. Goodman, "Mosaic Liberalism," Judaism, vol. 52 (2003), pp. 21-38. 4. In Rawls's words: "the principles that free and rational persons would accept in an initial position of equality as defining the fundamental terms of their association." A Theory of Justice (Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press, 1971), p. 11. Rawls confines the choice here to "basic" principles but affords the choosers no decisive grounds for identifying what will count as basic. That, it seems to me, is where Plato begins his constructive account in the Republic, by asking how one can or should adjudicate among competing goods. 5. Rawls tacitly assumes that rational choosers would show bias towards others like themselves. That assumption, of course, is not grounded in the idea of rationality. Rational people might find it advantageous to be led by others brighter than they are. Or they might prefer to leave the burdens of public service to those least like themselves and perhaps lesser equipt than they are to pursue higher (or lower?) aims than those of political leadership. Much depends on what values the choosers hold. The idea of rationality alone does not perspicuously answer that question. 6. Some have argued that Rawls's standard goes too far, others that it does not go far enough. Rawls can answer only that those who differ do not adequately understand what rationality would require. Unless the dispute is to devolve into a controversy over definitions, Rawls needs to make his definition of 'rational' explicitly stipulative, exposing the extent to which his argument is suppositious. 7. Yet the priority of liberty over life is clearly no analytic matter. Nor does it become a deductive lead pipe cinch even with the assumption of a rational advantage in keeping one's options open. For people can disagree about this?as many did, prominently, a generation ago, in the "better-Red-than-dead" debate, and as many, less vocally, still do. Indeed, there is no obvious material advantage in Rawls's prioritization?not for ego. When people are called on to risk or sacrifice their lives for the liberty of others, much will depend on the extent and kind of their identification with those in whose name the sacrifice is asked. The members of a society or community might compact together to take risks and make sacrifices in one another's behalf. But liberty is not the only good for which we humans frame such (typically tacit) compacts. To make liberty their only ultimate concern is to beg the question. 8. Rawls, Law of Peoples, pp. 4, 10-11. 9. Rawls seeks to dispel the mythic aura of the contract idea by speaking not of actual but of virtual consent. But, as I argued in On Justice (updated edition: Oxford: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2008), pp. 9-23, consent, whether actual or virtual, is a good index of justice but neither necessary nor sufficient as its criterion. 10.

Reflective equilibrium is supposed to bring us ever closer to the truth. But that hope trades on the assumption that reflection is invariably/ultimately progressive and that social interactions, invari ably/ultimately promote consensus. But social interactions may promote polarization, and consensus may foster dogma. The word 'reflective' is supposed to forestall such bad outcomes. But that means entrusting the case to persuasive definitions. 14. As I asked in On Justice (p. 18), "how would those who know nothing of their own values and have no experience of the testing of liberty against rival urgings and exigencies understand liberty? By what standards and with what reservations would sacrifices in behalf of liberty be recognized and rewarded?" 15. Rawls equates rationality with a certain form of egoism. As Amy Eckert points out, his original choosers "do not take an interest in each other's interests." Their rationality does have have goals, but narrow ones, like those that accountants take for granted in preparing tax returns. Does the original posi tion leave room, then, for a life based on the Buddhist teaching that all suffering stems from attachment and that liberation is won only by overcoming desire? Or for ascetics who take the goods of appetite to be evils? Or Stoics, who seek indifference to all externals? Rawls can say that such persons are free to pursue their ideals in the new society. But how, in ignorance of the attitudes they might later hold, can they frame a society that is not inimical, in the very principles of its operation, to the core values that they may come to hold?so inimical as to exclude or drastically marginalize the life they hope to pursue and share with their families, communities and children? Rationality does not rule out such choices, unless packed with biases unknown to choosers who are ignorant of their own values and beliefs. 16. Thomas Nagel, "Rawls on Justice," in Reading Rawls, ed.

See also Goodman, In Defense of Truth: A Pluralistic Approach (Amherst, N.Y.: Humanity Press, 2001), chap. 9, "Moral, Religious, and Hypostatic Truth." 22. Rawls's deliberators "must decide once and for all what is to count among them as just and unjust" (A Theory of Justice, p. 12). That stricture may be intended to suggest that they would preserve much openness to change. But the basic principles are to be inviolable: "Being first virtues of human activi ties, truth and justice are uncompromising" (p. 4). To those, from Dewey to Che, who hold change itself sacrosanct, the very idea of fixed basic principles may be anathema. Would it be irrational for someone who did not know if that would be his paramount value to reject all basic principles? 23. Russell Hardin (Vanderbilt Lecture, March 14,2004) argues that Hume would have embraced equal ity had he known how effectual governments could become and thus conquered his fears that equality was inevitably a "leveling down." Perhaps. But I suspect that Hume loathed equality as an enemy of excellence. Clearly he saw it as unstable if attained?and corrosive even in the offing: "historians, and even common sense, may inform us, that, however specious these ideas of perfect equality may seem, they are really, at bottom, impracticable; and were they not so, would be extremely pernicious to hu man society. Render possessions ever so equal, men's different degrees of art, care, and industry will immediately break that equality. Or if you check these virtues, you reduce society to the most extreme</page><page sequence="23">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 103 indigence; and instead of preventing want and beggary in a few, render it unavoidable to the whole community. The most rigorous inquisition too is requisite to watch every inequality on its first appear ance; and the most severe jurisdiction, to punish and redress it. But besides, that so much authority must soon degenerate into tyranny, and be exerted with great partialities; who can possibly be possessed of it, in such a situation as is here supposed? Perfect equality of possessions, destroying all subordination, weakens extremely the authority of magistracy, and must reduce all power nearly to a level, as well as property." Enquiry, Section 3. Part 2, ?5 = ed. Nidditch, p. 194. Hume has less difficulty with the idea that men would or should die for king and country than with appeals for liberty and equality. Hume cared no more for rationality than for equality, unless rationality were understood quite differently from the way it was by most of his contemporaries. Among the many who have hated the very idea of equality, Nietzsche perhaps takes pride of place. But he also, in his own way, would have dug his heels in not just at Rawls's version of rationality but at his deference to rationality from the outset?in place, let's say, of passion. 24. Aristotle, Nicomachaean Ethics V 4-5, esp. 1132b 32-1133a 5. 25. The Mosaic law treats the Sabbath as a cardinal principle, basic to the purposes of that law. Yet it concerns issues that Rawls's choosers might never have addressed and that Rawls himself finds entirely inappropriate to their deliberations. 26. Susan Okin, in a lecture delivered at Vanderbilt University, February 9, 2004, only a few weeks before her death, and citing work by Jane English published in the 1970s; Okin's text is now published as "Justice and Gender: An Unfinished Debate," Fordham Law Review, vol. 72 (2004), pp. 1537-1567. At the outset of A Theory of Justice (p. 8), Rawls stipulated that his principles "may not work for the rules and practices of private associations or for those of less than comprehensive social groups. They may be irrelevant for the various informal conventions and customs of everyday life; they may not elu cidate the justice, or perhaps better, the fairness of voluntary cooperative arrangements or procedures for making contractual agreements." Applied to the family, the admission seemed damning, since it glossed over so much that is of vital concern in core human relationships. Rawls responds to Okin's concerns in Law of Peoples, p. 158, but he still seemed to her to exempt the family from central concerns of justice. 27.

What is in play behind the veil of ignorance is practical reason. Can practical reason take cognizance of intrinsic worth?without invoking any "comprehensive doctrine"? Yet without some anchor point of intrinsic worth, instrumental value is valueless. As the use of the word 'environment' suggests, Rawls's story appeals implicitly to the intrinsic worth of human life at least. But what counts as preservation, what value is assigned to biodiversity, how human habitation and quality of life are balanced with non human needs are questions left unanswered in the original position. Understandably, since they raise basic value questions obscured by the veil of ignorance. Yet many would find such questions too basic to be left undecided before, say, basic property rights are defined. 32. See L. E. Goodman, "Naked in the Public Square," forthcoming in Theology in the Liberal State, ed. L. Kaplan (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2008).</page><page sequence="24">104 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY 33. For the roots of Liberalism, see, e.g., C. L. Becker, The Heavenly City of the Eighteenth Century French Philosophers (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2003 [first published 1932]). For liberalism as a way of life, e.g., see John Dewey, The Public and its Problems (Athens, Oh.: Swallow Press, 1991 [first published 1927]). 34. See Goodman, Judaism, Human Rights and Human Values (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), chap. 5, "The Rights and Wrongs of Nations." 35. Rawls, Law of Peoples, p. 34. 36. Ibid. Amy Eckert explains Rawls's intent: "Where states enjoy unrestricted sovereignty, peoples enjoy limited sovereignty, by virtue of their acceptance of limitations on the right to wage war and on the treatment of their own citizens." But Rawls's position here is fraught with difficulties: First, it reverses the grounds on which Locke's arguments win limitations on the sovereignty of states, by vesting the ultimate appeal in the peoples at whose behest and in whose interests those states are empowered to serve. Second, it ignores the penchant for self-serving found in every state and people. For it is rare, as Thucydides was probably not the first to observe, for a state or a people to admit that its wars were anything but defensive of its rights and interests?even rarer to acknowledge mistreatment of its own. The Soviet Union, and East Germany, North Korea and Zimbabwe have held out all that they did as in the service of the people. 37. Glossing Rawls in "Rawls on International Justice: A Defense," Political Theory, vol. 32 (2004), pp. 291-319, David Reidy stresses that peoples, for Rawls, are "corporate moral persons." He draws the corollary (p. 297, cf. p. 303) that Rawls's '"outlaw states' may qualify as corporate agents, but will not qualify as corporate moral agents," and therefore, that "Liberal democratic peoples need not theorize the demands of international justice with these states in mind." For "[a] people is always a system of social cooperation aimed at and justified by reference to the good of its members.... There is no place for slavery or servitude within a people. And the subsistence and security interests of all are secure." All false if meant descriptively; Pickwickian, if offered stipulatively. In a note (p. 315, n. 17), Reidy presses further: "Outlaw states are the corporate body politic analogue not to the domestic individual criminal who possesses the capacity to be reasonable but fails to perfectly realize it (and who is therefore owed justice in punishment), but rather to the sociopath who fails to possess the capacity to be reasonable to the requisite minimum degree and is thus properly quarantined and offered appropriate forms of care." Yet peoples do exercise moral agency, and states may be evil, not just demented. They may hold, and exercise, vicious notions of what reason dictates. (The same is true, I suspect, of some sociopaths: they too may be guilty and not merely sick.) 38. George Schultz, Kissinger Lecture, Library of Congress, Spring, 2004, excerpted in the Wall Street Journal, March 29, 2004. 39. Rawls even assumes that liberal peoples are eager to extend justice to others. Sometimes. As Nathan Sharansky observes: "Democratic leaders need peace to survive. Because democracies have to reflect the will of their people, democratic leaders choose appeasement, because anything is preferable to war. ... This is democracy's great strength as well as its great weakness." Interview in The Weekly Standard, June 21, 2004. 40. Rawls, Law of Peoples, e.g., p. 32. 41. Plato, Republic VIII 545-546. 42. Rawls postulates an overlapping consensus to secure the stability he assumes: The adherents of diverse comprehensive doctrines support the basic practices and principles of a liberal society, albeit for diverse reasons. No single comprehensive doctrine, Rawls assumes, can gain unanimous support without oppression. But political liberalism can. If the worry is that some people might object to basic practices and principles that Rawls deems liberal, he stipulates that those who constitute the populace of a liberal society would not. Once again everything becomes stipulative, and the thought experiment</page><page sequence="25">THE ROAD TO KAZANISTAN / 105 pretty largely loses its heuristic value: Liberal principles are those that liberal people would agree to, and we know that they would do so, because they are liberal people. 43. Rawls, Law of Peoples, p. 19. Rawls follows Sen here, and a long if unacknowledged line of mes sianic thinking. As I argued in On Justice (chap. 5), messianism avoids utopianism (in Spinoza's sense) only by fostering laws and practices that promote the transformation of human relations and thus the transformation of human character. Rawls has put the cart before the horse, presuming the very trans formation that his utopia requires. He provides no means to that transformation, no road for his cart to travel. His strictures on comprehensive doctrines in public fora make it unlikely that he can build one. 44. Rawls, Law of Peoples, pp. 19-20. 45. Rawls assumes that democracies do not make war on one another, and even non-democratic societ ies will be at peace in his world, since "satisfied peoples" do not make war. Yet, as Ed Santurri points out, Niebuhr could conceive of "a global democratic empire." For the "conditions that made democracy possible domestically, might not obtain internationally." As for Rawls's non-democratic peoples, their rejection of aggression is purely stipulative. 46. Rawls, Law of Peoples, p. 19 47. Ibid., p. 34. 48. By rights, a "-stan" should be a country. The glitch may be an artifact of an earlier phase in Rawls's text, before his decision to speak of peoples rather than nations, states, or lands. 49. Rawls, Law of Peoples, p. 5. 50. See L. E.

Liberal societies, Rawls urges, recognize the fact of change and seek to encourage it. "They do not, in any case stifle such change, as withholding respect from decent peoples might well do" (Law of Peoples, p. 61). True. But it's blaming the messenger to lay the stifling of change to those who faithfully report its difficulties?which barbs do not erase. 55.

Rawls, Law of Peoples p. 59. 57. Ibid., p. 61. 58. Ibid., pp. 68-69. 59. Two international gatherings are proposed by Rawls: one in which the representatives of liberal peoples hammer out the terms of their relations, and a second, in which other, non-liberal but "decent" peoples are invited to join, on terms of mutual toleration. This means, as Amy Eckert points out, that the non-liberal societies have no part in setting the rules of engagement. They determine, through their spokesmen, only whether they wish to sign on. Liberal values are thus privileged in the planning?prob ably not through conscious bias on Rawls's part (despite his patronizing language) but because the original question he faced was how to incorporate in his thinking societies and ideals different from his own. His answer: on terms acceptable to him.</page><page sequence="26">106 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY 60. Rawls, Law of Peoples, pp. 72-73. 61. Ibid., p. 74. 62. Ibid., p. 79. 63. Ibid., pp. 80-81. 64. Saddam lived with sanctions for years, and the United Nations officials charged with their humane implementation profited hugely from unlawful kickbacks drawn from the Oil for Food program. Sanc tions also may be deemed a casus belli by the nations sanctioned. 65. Rawls, Law of Peoples, pp. 93. 66. Ibid., p. 93. 67. Ibid., p. 97. 68. Eckert notices an oblique effect of the asymmetry Rawls has built in to the third and final use of the veil of ignorance: The delegates of liberal societies, knowing who they are and knowing the facts (as Rawls conceives them) of political economy, will conceive themselves the likely donors when the new difference principle is framed. Does this bias the choice Rawls imputes to them, to limit aid to what is needed to remove economic barriers to the construction of just or decent political and social institutions? Some might ask more, and others less. Rawls, by now, has clearly left Garrett Hardin behind. There is no trace here of Hardin's inhumane and racially tainted notions of rationality on lifeboat earth. But what is the proper measure of aid? I would answer in Maimonidean terms: what is needed to foster self-sufficiency in an emerging economy. It is not helpful to undercut or undermine local industry and agriculture. Nor is it culturally arrogant or intrusive to ensure that aid flows to its developmental, educational, and humanitarian beneficiaries, and not to numbered bank accounts that bankroll the repressive system perhaps long implicated in making a society burdened to begin with. 69. Rawls, Law of Peoples, p. 109. Cf. Barbara Ward, The Interplay of East and West, the Beatty Lec tures (London: Allen and Unwin, 1957). 70. Rawls, Law of Peoples, p. 119. 71. Rawls undercuts this strength of his by his tendency to think of others as more uniform than they really are. As Diane Perpich asks, "Isn't this a standard mistake we make, when we talk about those we deem 'other'? That is, we assume that the rich diversity of our 'own' culture is somehow lacking in theirs and that we can understand who 'they' are by understanding one dominant strain of their tradi tion" (personal communication, April 6, 2004). Indeed, this is what I call "essentializing the exotic and typifying the extreme." Rawls mitigates the problem by allowing for change within non-liberal societies. One worry is that change need not take the course he hopes for. Certainly few observers of Islamic societies in the 1960s expected the rise of militant, salafist pan-Islamism. Most widely expected and predicted was the gradual withering of religious devotion and the increasing rise of nationalist or socialist movements. 72. Rawls, Law of Peoples, p. 121. 73. Ibid., p. 121. 74. Rawls is prepared to predict that his negotiators will tolerate what he finds tolerable and will draw the line against what he finds intolerable. But here, as with his first use of the veil of ignorance, more norma tive weight is shifted to the definition of reason than any mere definition should be expected to bear. 75. I've been asked to spell out the role of Mosaic liberalism in this essay, and I have endeavored to do so. But I see no finer paradigm of what that liberalism calls for than the memory of how the exponents of the Mosaic ideal cheered the reunification of Germany, and welcomed the freeing of Afghanistan and the liberation of Iraq.</page></plain_text>
