<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nietzsche and Ventriloquism David Goldblatt One claim of this paper will be that Nietzsche's idea of interpreting the world, a central element for his perspectivist epistemology, is to give voice to it. It is to will the world vocalities, which are only our own often previously untapped voices-projections of ourselves offering readings of meaningful world items. These voices, according to Nietzsche, are most aesthetically interesting as they are distanced from our range of commonplace voices, a range considerable in itself. In order to help facilitate this Nietzschean theme I am introducing the low-art of show-biz ventriloquism as a paradigm that helps to express this idea of conversational exchange between two voice sources, which turn out to be just one source talking to itself. I hope to show in Nietzsche's work a tendency to value the activity of engaging in conversation with untalking entities, animate and inanimate alike. Like all paradigms ventriloquism's application runs stronger in some places, weaker in others. I shall begin the first section by briefly characterizing some of its relevant features.1 I Although ventriloquism is an ancient art and has had many forms and variations throughout its history I am choosing as a paradigm one particular instantiation from Western show business and I will maintain that that act is typical or representative, in important respects, of what we have come to think when we think of ventriloquism. The ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and the dummy Charlie McCarthy perform as two antithetical personalities, two voices conversationally engaged. 1.

McCarthy's voice is necessarily different from Bergen's but, if such a generalization can be made at all, it is also contingently different from the usual range of voices heard in everyday parlance. Bergen's demeanor is polite and calm, and his language is always formal and appropriate, while McCarthy is slangy, rude, unbridled and smart- alecky, always disrespectful. It is an act that came out of American vaudeville and reached its peak, somewhat ironically, on radio where the Charlie McCarthy Show was a prime-time national pastime. Edgar Bergen performs alone. What he does can be described as talking to or at least talking with himself. He throws his voice (a metaphor appropriately inappropriate) so that it appears as if he is talking to someone else but, as virtually no one in their audience believes he is, it is an illusion without deception. Indeed, one of the points of the act, the fun of it, is to know that Bergen is alone while understanding that two people are talking. The voice of McCarthy is Bergen's voice but it not a voice Bergen would have used, I suspect, had there not just been this ventriloqual possibility, the institution of ventriloquism if you will, presenting itself as an opportunity for another voice of Bergen's to make itself present. So the dummy, an inanimate object afterall, is not only identified (given another or special identification by Bergen), but also Bergen is identified by the dummy. Charlie, without Bergen, is silent but, as a body with face, he is not lacking meaningful features. What one marvels at when praising Bergen is his ability to convincingly sustain another voice, turn it off and on at will, and efface himself as speaker while simultaneously present himself as listener. He does this, but only in part, by trying not to move his lips while speaking, achieving difference or distance between himself and Charlie. No matter how well he performs he fools no one, and if he did it would undermine one of the premises of the act and undercut one form of appreciation by his audience. Against the background of show business comedy, there is something playful and childish about Bergen's ventriloqual act, although there have been other presentations of ventriloquism that present uglier, less good-natured manifestations that are made all the more horrible, I believe, by abusing such an innocent performance type. I am claiming that there is a certain ventriloqual tendency in Nietzsche and that many of the features of the Bergen/McCarthy paradigm are also located throughout Nietzsche's writings. That is the argument I will develop below.</page><page sequence="3">Nietzsche and Ventriloquism 421 n In The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche says, "At bottom the aesthetic phenomenon is quite simple: all one needs in order to be a poet is... to live surrounded by hosts of spirits. To be a dramatist all one needs is the urge to transform oneself and speak out of strange bodies and souls/' He then says, "What happens in the dramatic chorus is the primary dramatic phenomenon: projecting oneself outside oneself and then acting as though one had really entered another body, another character. . . what we have here is the individual effacing himself through entering a strange being."2 In his notebooks Nietzsche generalizes his emphasis upon voice projection by comparing the philosopher with the dramatic artist. The philosopher, he says, "...tries to permit all the sounds of the world to resonate within himself and to present this total sound outside himself by means of concepts: expanding himself to the macrocosm while, at the same time, maintaining reflective circumspection-like the actor or dramatic poet who transforms himself and at the same time retains his circumspection so that he can project himself outwards."3 Like the ventriloquist, the philosopher/artist throws his voice outward, a voice which is at the same time not his ordinary voice. This voice projection is the occasion for a transformation of an ordinary self to another self, which is nothing but its outward appearance as voice. The idea of projecting oneself outward and locating oneself in other entities calls into play the unreified idea of self that Nietzsche wrestles with throughout his writings, and it is an idea I will come to later on. But it is clearly a Heraclitean self that Nietzsche endorses-a volatile self whose relationship with the world is constantly blurred and whose identity is co-opted by its vocalized projections. Nietzsche's discussion of tragedy etymologically suggests the song of the goat, the goat-like satyr, an early, other, musical voice. Nietzsche's well-known idea is that intoxicated festival participants, by dropping individual differences, triggered the appearance of Dionysus by vocalizing as a unity. Such a move was meant to unleash our own repressed animality and hence our affinity with untamed nature. This break with our usual alienated selves led to the un-individuated chorus that characterized early Greek tragedy. On Nietzsche's view, before the diluted demise of tragedy, artistic tendency was a foil for the status quo 2. Friedrich Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy, trans.

What Nietzsche bemoans in the age of Socrates is the extent to which tragedy lost the self-splitting ecstacy of the festivals and became allied with the "bourgeois mediocrity in which Euripides placed all his political hopes/'4 Nietzsche points to the Dionysian festival as the contextual opportunity to drop the traditional will which is tautologically tied to everyday aims and purposes. Since the will is unreified for Nietzsche, it is only through daily projects that the will comes into being in the first place-the will exists only as its role is manifested in intentional projects. This necessary connection between interested will and goal is an idea Nietzsche gets from Schopenhauer, but one he subsequently expands to meet the needs of artists, philosophers and other attempters.5 I shall return to this theme later. The ventriloquist like Bergen presents himself as a quotidian voice projecting a speech relatively strange in content and in style, i.e., in non-Bergenian manner, onto the dummy Charlie, while effacing himself as speaker and presenting himself as listener of his own voice as if it came from outside. The Birth of Tragedy is an early work. But the "advice" Nietzsche gives to dramatists in The Birth of Tragedy he echoes throughout his works to those types he believes will break status quo boundaries, those who exhibit a willingness to resist civic concerns and comforts, and those who grasp the extent to which their recognition of the world is their own invention. The artist and the philosopher (as Nietzsche idealizes them) are two such creative types, and Nietzsche often attributes to them ventriloqual insights and powers, portraying them as approaching the world in ventriloqual terms. In Beyond Good and Evil , for example, the philosopher "...is a man who constantly experiences, sees, hears, suspects, hopes and dreams extraordinary things; who is struck by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside, from above and below... a storm pregnant with new lightnings.... A philosopher; alas, a being who often runs away from himself- but whose curiosity always makes him 'come to himself' again."6 If projecting a strangely speaking self to another being suggests the trade of the ventriloquist, there are, too, analogies in The Birth of Tragedy to the artist as dummy. For it is precisely when the "spell of 4. BT, p. 71. 5. Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil , trans. Walter Kaufmann (New York, 1966), p. 52; hereafter BGE. 6. BGE , p. 230.</page><page sequence="5">Nietzsche and Ventriloquism 423 individuation" is broken, when the will is emptied, that the festival participant becomes a "medium," an open and passive conduit for the forces of nature which Nietzsche sometimes spoke of as an Original Oneness. He says, "...to the extent that the subject is an artist he is already delivered from individual will and has become a medium through which the True Subject celebrates His redemption in illusion. . . (W)e have every right to view ourselves as esthetic projections of the veritable creator and derive such dignity as we possess from our status as artworks."7 Here, at the intersection of artwork, artist and also audience, the festival participant, in "forgetting" the self of polis life, satisfies conditions necessary for forces he/she does not understand to consciously surface and manifest themselves. Here, such forces, like Freud's libido, are projected through ourselves as the ventriloquist's voice is projected through the dummy. As the artist uses pigments or flutes, as the ventriloquist uses another voice, so Nietzsche conceives that Nature henceforth uses human bodies, resistant to their own animality, as sites for the realization of natural forces. Although Nietzsche later dropped an archetypical Oneness as a source of rapturous voice, the artist/dummy analogue (the artist as medium for the passage of things artistic) remained in his writing when addressing matters of the will. Here, Nietzsche's will is not synonymous with, and is sometimes held in contrast to, intention. "We immoralists have the suspicion that what is of value in an action is precisely what is unintentional in it, while everything about it that is intentional, everything about it that can be seen, known, 'conscious,' still belongs to its surface and skin-which, like every skin, betrays something but conceals even more.... (I)ntention is only a sign and symptom that still requires interpretation-moreover a sign that means too much and therefore, taken by itself alone, almost nothing."8 If the ventriloquist is to be understood as a controlling or at least intentional figure, the dummy is the medium for another voice, one different from the ventriloquist's yet a voice of the ventriloquist. I will try to explain the relationship between voice and will later on. But for now it is enough to note that the philosopher/artist is one who directs other voices but also one who opens him/herself to allow nonquotidian voices to be given form and structure. All of art may be connected with willing and all artwork may be connected with the artist. But art is not necessarily connected with the 7. BT, pp. 41-42. 8. BGE, p. 44.</page><page sequence="6">424 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques artist's intentions, and if it were, it might reveal almost nothing about the works it consciously voices. The artist may be in the worst position to interpret his/her own intentions. The interpretation of the subject by the subject, then, is not necessarily a better epistemological project than the interpretation of the subject's object. In this context, Nietzsche's ambivalence toward Socrates can be reflected in Socrates' attitude of dismissal toward the rhapsode Ion who, out of his (everyday) mind performs ecstatically as a blessed medium for the voice of a god but knows nothing of his own art. Ill In an atypical notebook entry which he entitles, "Oedipus/ Soliloquy of the Last Philosopher," Nietzsche writes about an intense loneliness that forces the philosopher to talk with himself: No one talks to me other than myself, and my voice comes to me as the voice of a dying man! Let me associate for but one hour more with you, dear voice, with you, the last trace of memory of all human happiness. With you I escape loneliness through self- delusion and lie myself into multiplicity and love. For my heart. . . cannot bear the shudder of the loneliest loneliness and so it forces me to speak as if I were two persons.9 There is uncharacteristic pity if not self-pity in the above passage, emotion bordering on narcissism. But Nietzsche's writings tend to embrace al oneness, even solitude as loneliness. Indeed, Nietzsche usually sees his artists and philosophers in a distinctly advantageous, if sometimes forced position, in riding (like the American cowboy with a dummy of a sidekick) solo through the herd. Even in solitude, Nietzsche warns, "the voice of the herd will still be audible in you." Oedipus, we recall, was always one identity too many, always only a trace of his real self. In Nietzsche's Oedipus' soliloquy he tends to view talking to oneself as the kind of last resort belonging to individuals marginalized by society. But elsewhere in Nietzsche's writings, talking to another self, in another voice, is characteristic of, if not essential for, creative activity. Any characterization of the ventriloquist as merely alone would be incomplete in some significant sense. Nevertheless, the ventriloquist is 9. PT, p. 33.</page><page sequence="7">Nietzsche and Ventriloquism 425 alone, and being alone, approaches a kind of ideal condition for the artist and philosopher type in Nietzsche's writings. Although this Nietzschean idea, in Zarathustra and elsewhere, is well recognized, it is not clear just what it means or what would constitute an exhaustive set of reasons for Nietzsche's motivation. His claim here may be a contingent one, given the rarity of such individuals-since everyday life is overwhelming, its contentment nearly irresistible, its desire for acceptance powerful, and its conceptual range so narrow-all of which are detrimental for creative self-overcoming. In any case, philosophical and artistic imagination must not be seduced and eventually destroyed by the institutional contingencies of everyday life, a process in which we merely learn the voices already incorporated and incorporating such lives, rather than attempting to conceive new ones in ourselves and project them onto the world. What I wish to emphasize here, however, is that solitude is the optimum situation for hearing the untapped voices of the self. Such untapped voices just are constituents of our selves (our other selves), and solitude lubricates their articulation, undisturbed by the traditional, repetitive noise of the crowd. As Nietzsche says in The Gay Science, "In solitude: Those who live alone do not speak too loud nor write too loud, for they fear the hollow echo- the critique of the nymph Echo. And all voices sound different in solitude."10 But these possible self- articulations, in the hands of the artist, the philosopher and other attempters, are projected onto the world in nonquotidian ways, anchored to objects of our own conception that arise in our attempts to understand the given world. The world then, for the artist, is only the occasion for such articulation, locating the voice in the world, the voice which is only another formulated manifestation of self. It is the artist interpreting the world. It is not entirely unlike what we do in dreams. But in dreams the illusion that the creation is uncreated lacks conviction. In one of his aphorisms Nietzsche says, "When we are awake, we do what we do in dreams. We invent the person with whom we associate and immediately forget it."11 The philosopher and the artist do what we all must do and what all dreamers do, but in contrast, do it in ways that break the limits of commonplace proprieties. This is sometimes isolating, if not alienating. Although being alone may paradigmatically display the hermit (Zarathustra leaving town and heading for the mountains), being alone does not preclude having encounters (alone in 10. Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science, trans. Walter Kaufmann (New York, 1966), p. 203; hereafter GS. 11. BGE, p. 88.</page><page sequence="8">426 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques the crowd or in the presence of others), as we also see in Zarathustra's case. But Nietzsche believes that those genuine encounters the philosopher has are often the self-conscious attribution of self-identities to those we encounter, those beings in the world who now take on voices that have only been made up. IV The self for Nietzsche is unreified and unfixed. It is creator and creature. Nietzsche often stresses the value, for some, of recognizing the self's stranger possibilities and actualizing them. The philosopher and artist can express these selves in action by linking them to objects, e.g. novels, paintings and so forth. There, in texts/works, is the localization of the selves' other voices, where the concepts of style and genius already await them. The works both are and are not the self that originated them. "I am one thing," Nietzsche says, "my creations are another."12 Yet in his Ecce Homo his remarks about the diversity of his writing styles draws a close link between his various styles and the numerous possibilities that, in part, constitute the self. 3 Nietzsche says, "To communicate a state, an inner tension of pathos by means of signs, including the tempo of these signs, -that is the meaning of every style; and in view of the fact that the multiplicity of inner states in me is enormous, I am capable of many kinds of style-in short, the most multifarious art of style that any man has ever had at his disposal."14 As Heidegger says about Nietzsche's idea of art: "Art belongs to a realm where we find ourselves--we are the very realm. Art does not belong to regions which we ourselves are not, and which therefore remain foreign to us, regions such as nature."15 Heidegger's remarks certainly need qualification. Nature is foreign to us as thing-in-itself. But Nietzsche's attitude toward Nature is very like his view of art: both are anthropomorphisms (the very idea of Nature as well as what we have come to call the natural world). I will return to this last point later on. 12. Friedrich Nietzsche, "Why I Write Such Excellent Books," in Ecce Homo , trans. Anthony M. Ludovici (New York, 1964), p. 55; hereafter EH. 13.

The interpreting self is also subject to interpretation and is only its articulated possibilities and actualities. Nietzsche says "... thinking is something dependent upon human option and does not touch the thing itself/'16 All thinking is vocality. Articulated thought comes to us with characteristics akin to those of speech. In terms of voice, the traditional self arrests the development of new vocal possibilities. The artist, on the other hand, overflows with other, stranger voices, constituent of the revelation of possible selves. Nietzsche often describes the artist as overfull, the self spilling into the world because it must expand. Just as the will "is above all something complicated, something which is a unit only as a word,"17 so too the artist is less simple than one might suppose. In the Will to Power Nietzsche notes of painters, "No one is simply a painter; all archaeologists, psychologists, theatrical producers of this or that recollection or theory.... are full and overfull of general ideas."18 But as Heidegger warns us, "...the feeling of plenitude does not suggest an inexhaustible stockpile of inner events. It means above all an attunement which is so disposed that nothing is foreign to it, nothing too much for it, which is open to everything and ready to tackle anything..."19 (This remark of Heidegger's about nothing being foreign to the artist must be juxtaposed to his above claim that Nature is). The will can express a self, can be a measure of that self, but sometimes from sources unfamiliar to the self itself. "We are always strangers to ourselves," Nietzsche says in the Genealogy. And in Twilight of the Idols, in high rhetorical style, he asks, "What? Art thou looking for something? Thou wouldest fain multiply thyself tenfold, a hundredfold? Thou seekest followers? Seek ciphers."20 Art is a paradigm way of being in which strange selves come to be articulated in the artist's interplay with the world. In his Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks, Nietzsche comments with approval about the Heraclitean interplay of selves in the conflation between world and self: "For what he here invented is a rarity even in the sphere of mystic incredibilities and 16.

'The world is the game Zeus plays/ or, expressed more concretely, 'of the fire with itself. This is the only sense in which the one is at the same time the many.'"21 Similarly, the ventriloquist's activity reflects both unity and diversity, playing in the spirit of the Heraclitean game. The ventriloquist is engaged in an exchange or interplay of voices with himself, but in an invented voice not his own which is attributed to that part of the world which he/she has vocally invented. Nietzsche says, "Philosophy is a form of artistic invention."22 Artworks, at least, are inventions that say something on their own. But even anonymous artworks are understood as they are in connection with those inventors who gave voice to them. Nietzsche sometimes saw the object of artistic or philosophical invention as something other, even something personally oppositional. Here in a passage anticipating the claims of Foucault, Barthes and others about the independence of work and author, Nietzsche says, ...everything great, whether a work or a deed, once it is completed, turns immediately against its author. The very fact that he is its author makes him weak at this time. He can endure his deed. He can no longer look it full in the face. To have something at one's back which one could never have willed, something to which the knot of human destiny is attached-and to be forced thenceforward to bear it on one's shoulders! Why it almost crushes one. The rancor of greatness! A somewhat different experience is the uncanny silence that reigns about one."23 The image of bearing a work upon one's shoulders recalls the Dwarf on the shoulders of Zarathustra. For the ventriloquist the dummy is usually on knees, not shoulders, but in most cases, certainly in Bergen's case, there is an oppositional relationship between dummy and ventriloquist-- the dummy saying the words in tones of voice that the ventriloquist never would, words that gain a certain independence from Bergen's "real" life. But this just is Bergen's life and he is just saying the dummy's words if only in an extraordinary way. Art is the real work of the artist and he or she just does empower those objects worked upon. 21. Friedrich Nietzsche, Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks , trans.

EH, p. 105.</page><page sequence="11">Nietzsche and Ventriloquism 429 "Art is will to power," Nietzsche says, as an artwork is always in some sense territorialized by the artist, as the character of a work simultaneously takes on an independence from the character of the artist while remaining, in a sense, the artist's possession. In interpretation there is territoriality. And willing interprets. Nietzsche says, "All meaning is will to power,"24 and "The will to power interprets.... In fact, interpretation is itself a means of becoming master of something."25 V Nietzsche recognizes the anthropomorphic nature of knowing. "For the plant, the whole world is a plant; for us, it is human."26 Rather than adopt skepticism or continue along the misguided path of searching for an approach to some nonanthropomorphic world- version, he embraces anthropomorphism. Some reasons for this, such as the unavailability of the thing-in-itself and his reading of the knowledge drive as will to power, are often discussed in Nietzschean literature. But beyond anthropomorphism, Nietzsche also claims that there is a personal aspect to knowledge and encourages those "higher types" to open themselves to their imposition of individualistic personality upon objects without being restrained by any need for truth or accuracy. "Art depends upon the inexactitude of sight. Similarly in the case of the ear: art depends upon a similar inaccuracy re: rhythm, temperament, etc."27 Philosophical work as well as artistic work is personal: "In the philosopher... there is nothing whatever that is impersonal...." Hence, Nietzsche's Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks purports to be an account of the history of ancient Greek philosophy as an expression of personalities. He says that even wholly erroneous philosophical systems "always have one incontrovertible point: personal mood, color." In his introduction to that work he expresses his quest for philosophical personality in terms of sound : "I am going to emphasize only that point of each of their systems which constitutes a slice of personality and hence belongs to that incontrovertible, non-debatable evidence which it is the task of history to preserve. It is meant to be a beginning, by means of 24. WP, p. 323. 25. WP, p. 342. 26. PT, p. 105. 27. PT, p. 20.</page><page sequence="12">430 Historical Reflections /Reflexions Historiques a comparative approach, toward the recovery and re-creation of certain ancient names, so that the polyphony of Greek nature at long last may resound once more."28 In this respect he offers an objection to the general enterprise of science as effacing the person of the scientist. One technique for such leaving-behind-the-person is to unify science (and hence knowledge in general) as a monolithic, uniform voice. That voice- authoritative, male, serious- does not reflect a gay science, as Nietzsche puts it, and as a single voice it puts itself forward wrongly, as an exclusive voice. But it is not an uncreated voice, arising as it does from imagination and representing only one of the possibilities of style that are part of knowledge-seeking. VI In a passage apt for ventriloqual analogy but provocative even for him, Nietzsche says, "He who knows not how to plant his will in things at least endows them with some meaning: that is to say, he believes that a will is already present in them. (A principle of faith.)"29 It is an approach reminiscent of Nietzsche's characterization of pre-Socratic Greek philosophy: "The Greeks, among whom Thales stood out so suddenly, were the very opposite of realists, in that they believed only in the reality of men and gods, looking upon all of nature as but a disguise, a masquerade, or a metamorphosis of these god-men."30 Our own age foregrounds Thales' materialism while tending to repress his idea that spirits are in all things. In any case, I take Nietzsche's remarks to mean that there are those who do know how to plant their wills in things and those who do not recognize their wills in things but who nevertheless attribute meanings to things as if those meanings were independent of willing. As meanings are the articulations of wills, the idea of wills as endowers of meaning at least contains the idea of the projection of voices. Sometimes Nietzsche is quite specific about how this works and here I will mention briefly the importance Nietzsche gives to metaphor in this transference or transplantation of will. Others, like Arthur Danto, have written about and recognized the centrality of 28. PTG, pp. 23-24. 29 . 77, p. 3. 30. PTG , p. 41.</page><page sequence="13">Nietzsche and Ventriloquism 431 metaphor in Nietzsche's writings and its role as microcosm for works of art. The idea of projection or transfer is at the heart of the importance Nietzsche attributes to metaphor as a simultaneous use of a stale concept and a creation of new reality. Here Nietzsche expresses his view of a relation between metaphor and sense perception: "Our sense perceptions are based, not upon unconscious inferences, but upon tropes. The primal procedure is to seek out some likeness between one thing and another, to identify like with like."32 Metaphorical transference is all any philosopher considers when worrying about sense-perception. "What the philosopher is seeking is not the truth but the metamorphosis of the world into men."33 Here Nietzsche clearly means fresh metaphor as we usually do in our discussion of metaphor. For Nietzsche the important contrast is between fresh and stale metaphor rather than that between the metaphorical and the literal. Fresh or new additions to the language do not simply give us common characteristics that a traditional and new use share, but new tones, colorings or moods that must accompany the projection embodying an object with meaning by willing it voice. This in turn allows us to understand or, better, experience it in a new way, perhaps even one that will generate hosts of new connections, scenarios, ways of seeing or hearing what the object says (can mean) to us. Eventually, the metaphor may appear to be a condition of the world as its projection shares the fate of all becoming: it grows old. When metaphors grow old, they gain an apparent independence from the will that first projected them, taking on a character of their own (the way Charlie takes on a character of his own). Such a process of self-projection is at once a coming to know the world, coming to know ourselves, and an act of creation. (In that respect it is not entirely unlike Collingwood's concept of expression as coming to know individuated emotion.) In the Genealogy, for example, when Nietzsche announces that we must remain strangers to ourselves- must mistake ourselves-he says that some men are seekers of knowledge but the problem (or rather one problem) is that even they do 31. See for example Danto's Transfiguration of the Commonplace (Cambridge, MA, 1981) or his earlier Nietzsche as Philosopher (New York, 1965). 32. PT, pp. 48-49. 33. PT, p. 52.</page><page sequence="14">432 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques not listen. "When it come to such matters, our heart is simply not in it~ we don't even lend our ear."34 I noted earlier that were the will only intentionally conceived projections interpreting the world, it would be like the ventriloquist giving voice to objects external to our traditionally conceived selves. But since the will is not to be identified with our intentionally conceived ideas but rather also includes those drives and forces which will always remain unknown to us, we are also, epistemologically, in the position of the dummy-a transit or medium for forces moving through our conscious selves, like Plato's Ion assuming the role of dummy for the god's voice. The artist and philosopher must do both: conceive of ideas which are not already part of the culture and open him/herself up to ideas which are products of drives and forces he/she does not yet understand. The articulation of these forces (something like the imposition of Apollinian elements upon the Dionysian) results in vocalized thoughts, voices, if you will, which are not to be confused with things-in- themselves. Is there a real Charlie McCarthy? Well, yes. It is exactly the McCarthy Bergen has created. Could he have created it entirely independent of our culture? No, but it is a voice of Bergen's not heard before. It is Bergen overflowing into the world. If Bergen speaks strange voices it sets Bergen apart and gives Bergen a new identity as well. As Heidegger has told us the artist is the origin of the artwork, and the artwork is the origin of the artist. That Bergen has given voice to this dummy at all is an odd thing. But Bergen just is an artist. The whole act, the whole tradition of show business, not unlike art, is ambiguously placed in everyday life. Activities like Duchamp's projecting "In Advance of the Broken Arm" upon a commonplace object, according to Danto's conception, embody it with new meaning. Even if new meaning is a theoretical constituency of the object, we must articulate it vocally with humor or irony, sarcasm or disdain, flirtation or arrogance, intentional ambiguity, tongue-in- cheek, the way Duchamp's project does all of these, as two perceptually indiscernible inscriptions or linguistic strings can take on different meanings if phonetically varied. 34.

Although he does not, in those first remarks, engage the sun in conversation, Zarathustra later speaks to and with animals as well as the many figures that do not seem to be partaking in the world of insurance and dry goods that make up the town from which Zarathustra has long been a part, but more recently apart. I am suggesting a reading of Zarathustra that would interpret Zarathustra's conversational encounters with others as conversations with himself-each encounter deserving an analysis in this respect that I will not do in this paper. Seeing others as aspects of ourselves is not unlike Nietzsche reminding us elsewhere that the master-slave duality can be understood as parts of a single soul or that we dream up our encounters as we make up our dreams. Somewhat cryptically Nietzsche says, "The whole of Zarathustra might perhaps be classified under the rubric of music. At all events, the essential condition of its production was a second birth within me of the art of hearing/'35 Nietzsche's fascination with music and musicians, in all phases of his work from The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music on, is well known. For Nietzsche, music, I suggest, is something like another voice and one not belonging to the conversation of everyday life. But Nietzsche's reference to an art of hearing may well be this art of listening to one's encounters in the world, which is also listening to oneself. When Zarathustra begins his descent he warns, "But the worst enemy you can encounter will always be you; you lie in wait for yourself in caves and woods."36 And it is in caves and woods that Zarathustra finds his conversants. Could Zarathustra have created his own conversants, the companions that offer the occasions of his speech? "Companions the creator once sought, and children of this hope; and behold, it turned out that he could not find them, unless he first created them himself."37 And though Zarathustra spends his time "outside," i.e., not indoors, Zarathustra suggests that he could never be outside himself: "For me- how should there be any outside - myself. There is no outside. But all sounds make us forget this; how lovely it is that there are sounds." The dwarf that Zarathustra encounters cautions, "...every 35. EH, p. 97. 36.

Sentenced to yourself and to your stoning-O Zarathustra, far indeed have you thrown the stone, but it will fall back on yourself." When the dwarf climbs on Zarathustra's shoulders, like Nietzsche's works mentioned earlier, Zarathustra says ambiguously "Dwarf! It is you or I," which he repeats again a bit later. About the friend he expresses again the primacy of the duality of self just as one would think the friend a welcome party: "I and me are always too deep in conversation: how could one stand that if there were no friend? For the hermit the friend is always the third person... What is the face of your friend anyway? It is your own face in a rough and imperfect mirror."38 Gary Shapiro offers a similar reading of Zarathustra's encounters: "Zarathustra's animals, his snake and his eagle, are aspects of himself, his cleverness and pride. When Zarathustra discourses with animals... he is moving within the circuit of self-contained language."39 Shapiro considers this part of an ironic movement, "to leave part of himself through deception." Zarathustra does more than implant metaphors. By implanting or transplanting wills through metaphor Nietzsche has found a way to open those metaphors to conversation without leaving their circumscribed domains of extended meaning. The embodying of meaning is both will to power and imagination. It is the way the artist listens to the world with or without a traditional artifact. But the artist qua artist is never without a dummy. For the dummy is the license for projecting the self, for implanting wills, for letting other voices speak and for speaking ourselves into the world. VIII I am interested in the idea of voice, which is central to the ventriloquist, in part to emphasize its frequency of appearance in Nietzsche's work. As noted above changes in vocality with respect to the same linguistic string can yield different meanings and generate very different language games. But I am primarily interested in vocality as it can be utilized in understanding our aesthetic response-response to artifacts or to anything else. It is vocality that gives objects of meaning their aura. Henry Staten says this very well and I am attending to voice in Nietzsche for reasons similar to those addressed by him in his book, 38. Z, p. 55. 39. Gary Shapiro, Nietzschean Narratives (Bloomingtori, IN, 1989), p. 102.</page><page sequence="17">Nietzsche and Ventriloquism 435 Nietzsche's Voice . Staten likes the power of the idea of voice for several reasons. Here he mentions one: I use the figure of voice. . .because I want to exploit the metaphoric resources this figure opens, above all that of tone or tonality. Tone is just as much a property of the written text as grammar and figuration, though it is a more fugitive and less formalizable property, and it is in the tone of a voice/text that the libidinal forces motivating utterance are most clearly revealed, even against the will of the speaker/writer. This is most true when the speaker/writer attempts the most difficult rhetorical circumstances. The crucial point is that libidinal forces too are textual; perhaps they are the text in its totality and concreteness, and all our other textual categories are their analytical decomposition.40 Although there is much to say in Nietzsche about voices spoken aloud or then spoken to oneself, I also slip, happily, into a more extended use of 'voice/ I do this metaphorizing because I think it is valuable to think of artworks as vocalizations of ourselves in voices other than our ordinary ones. In this sense paintings are other voices as much as poems (more obviously) are. Miss Marchmont, a character of a certain derision in Virginia Woolf's Jacob's Room , had the "philosophy that colour is sound-or, perhaps, it has something to do with music." But given the coincidental vocabularies, soft and loud, for example, that we use for each, Miss Marchmont's belief gains a bit of insight if not credibility. We do, in any case, ask, "What does this painting say (to you)?" as well as "What is the artist saying here?" But I also believe that it is a Nietzschean idea that when we talk to the world the world talks back. Artists and philosophers talk to the world and listen even when they are only there alone and it is only them talking to themselves or opening themselves to the world in the inventive self-projection of their articulated projects. 40.
