<plain_text><page sequence="1">JIM ATON Southern U tah State College An Interview with Barry Lopez Barry Lopez was born in Port Chester, New York on January 6, 1945. He spent his early years in southern California before, in his words, "it became a caricature of itself." At age eleven his family moved from rural San Fernando Valley back east to Manhattan. Lopez attended Jesuit schools there, then went on to Notre Dame University to study English, history and drama. A few summers in between he worked on a ranch in Wyoming. Lopez graduated cum laude with an A.B. in 1966, worked for part of the year as a sales representative for New American Library and married Sandra Landers, a bookwright, in 1967. He returned to his alma mater, where he completed an M.A.T. in 1968. Shortly thereafter Lopez moved west and entered an M.F.A. pro- gram at the University of Oregon, studying folklore and journalism from 1969-70. At that point, however, he "was more interested in writing than going to school," so he settled in an Oregon logging community and began writing full time. From 1968 to 1971 Lopez worked for I1 he New York Times as a stringer writing feature articles, and he has done the same for The Washing- ton Post since 1970. Although fiction, folklore and natural history essays had been Lopez's interest from the beginning, his first widely published pieces were articles in Popular Science in the early 70s. In the mid-70s, though, Lopez's work began appearing in national publications like Harper's , Audubon , Science , Outside , and North American Review . He continues to publish in these magazines. His first published book, Desert Notes , came in 1976, followed rapidly by four others: Giving Birth To Thunder , Sleeping With His Daughter (1977), Of Wolves and Men (1978), River Notes (1979), and Winter Count (1981). The wolf book, as he calls it, won the John Burroughs Medal for best book on natural history and gained for Lopez international attention.</page><page sequence="2">4 Western American Literature Lopez continues to live in Oregon with his wife Sandra. They have no children. His latest book, Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape , will appear in the spring of 1986. This interview took place in May, 1984 in Cedar City, Utah, and in July, 1984 at Lopez's home in Oregon. Atom Let's begin by talking about western American literature. Is there something different about it, or characteristic? Lopez: My general sense is that landscape plays a more important and more discernible role in western American fiction than it does in eastern American fiction. When I think of eastern fiction, I think of a contention of minds, a novel or a short story that is largely a psychological confronta- tion, without reference to things outside a man-made world. The reference might be to what's going on in a room, or to driving a car, or to a railroad station: to things that people have made. That's one way of seeing, and I think it grows out of a European sensibility. The European writing I know rarely recognizes a power in the land that corresponds to a power of being, while one of the things that distin- guishes American literature, especially in the West, is that you expect to see the land turn up in a powerful or a mysterious or an affecting way. It's possible, of course, to create a piece of literature that is only a confrontation between a human being and the land. I had a classical education, in an eastern private school, and I value that education enormously. I went to Europe for three months when I was 21 to see the places I'd studied, the touchstones of my education. But then I came back to America. I had grown up in southern California before it became a caricature of itself, and I wanted to come back out west. I'd be happy for the rest of my life to just try to elucidate what it is that is North America. Obviously, then, something that's very much on my mind is: what is going to be the North American contribution in literature? To my mind what North American literature is really about is the relationship between human beings and landscape. One of the things that's very striking about a novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude is that the book is impossible to understand without understanding the land. This is more often the case I think with South American than North American literature. The mystery of the land is very much a part of that literature. So it's curious to me that certain critical minds can be so enamoured of Latin American literature, yet miss the same elements that are part of the literature of their own country.</page><page sequence="3">Jim At on 5 Another thing that is remarkable to me is a kind of defensiveness about western American literature, trying to make people notice what's being written out here. Drawing out the spiritual power of the land - this is not something you have to be living in Utah or Oregon or Montana to write well about. It's a frame of mind. The incorporation of the land like this into mainstream American fiction is something I think is growing. People should not worry about getting a handful of people in the East to understand this. Atom In American fiction some of the best evocations of landscape have traditionally turned up in hunting stories. Which do you think are the best of those hunting stories? Lopez : I don't know. I read The Bear long ago and I am about to reread the story. When I think about hunting I am more drawn to read Laurens van der Post's The Heart of the Hunter or The Lost World of the Kalahari - the two books are linked. Or Richard Nelson's Hunters of The Northern Ice. Or even J. A. Baker's The Peregrine. I grew up reading the hunting stories of Hemingway and Melville. I probably read Moby Dick five times before I was 18. That was a very important book for me and of course it's a seminal part of American literature. What could more powerfully describe the range of the relation- ship between landscape and human beings? It's a virtuoso performance. Aton : About your own books: in the Coyote stories ( Giving Birth To Thunder) y taking oral stories and turning them into written stories, what kinds of problems did you have in recording them? Did you get them from textual or oral sources? Did you use a tape recorder? Lopez : That was the first book that I wrote. I was fascinated by the character. I read many collections of Trickster stories and saw that some- thing was missing - to me. I read the predictable things: Paul Radin's work, Stith Thompson, and back issues of the Journal of American Folk- lore , The American Museum of Natural History Bulletin Anthropological Papers , Folklore , and things like the papers of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition - the different sources in which the stories were recorded. And sort of working from my own background in reading in Native American thought and things that I trusted and was guided to by Barre Toelken, a scholar in this area, I tried to get a grip on how the stories might have been told. I made no pretension, I had no presumption of doing anything in a scholarly way. I just wanted the stories to come alive and to see them more widely circulated. I think probably nothing I've ever done in my life did</page><page sequence="4">6 Western American Literature I fool with more at the end. I nearly drove myself crazy with the Trickster stories, because I was never completely satisfied with the syntax. I was always feeling intimidated by the heritage I was dealing with. I was reluctant to go off in certain directions. But to directly answer the questions: no, I did not use any tape recordings. My contact with native people telling Trickster stories at that time was pretty much in passing. Virtually all of the work was library work, then trying to understand how this material might have been mistranslated to begin with, and then going back and working in these areas. I would still like to go back and really grapple with that character. I was just feeling my way with those first stories, trying to work out rhythms and translations and mixes of stories. I wanted to convey different parts of the character. I was not interested in a collection full of stories about how Coyote, for example, indulges himself sexually. That's a very narrow understanding of Coyote, as somebody who's only foolish, who's always eating too much and what not. There's much more going on there. And we were talking about this earlier: if one were to project interest- ing directions in which to see American literature go, certainly somebody could write a very powerful novel about contemporary Coyote. It could be something very American. Aton : Non-fictional coyotes certainly have created controversy in the West between ranchers and environmentalists. How would you convince a stockman that he needs predators (wolves, coyotes, etc.) and that it's in his best interests to help preserve them? Lopez: I think I probably wouldn't. If I sat down with a stockman on his ranch I would like to know what he thinks about the land he lives on, where he came from, what his family is like, whether he plans to move on. I would ask: what are his attachments to the land? What does he know about animals, the animals he's raising and the animals indigenous to the region? What does he know about the plants? I don't mean this in an antagonistic way. I would just be ingenuously curious about what he was. Then I would understand somehow whether what I know about predator- prey relationships or about eagles, coyotes or wolves would be of genuine interest to him or would provide him with a point of illumination. In writing non-fiction, where I'm traveling to a place, I take tre- mendous pleasure in trying to find a way of making it come alive for someone who has never been there, but not in telling him what he should think about it.</page><page sequence="5">Jim Aton 7 So far as my own life is concerned I do try - I'm as impatient and as arrogant on certain points as anyone else - to remind myself to be tolerant of other views. When I'm writing, I'm even more aware of that, of making part of the story an atmosphere of tolerance. If you put me in the position of trying to convince a stockman to let predators live, I'd probably want to bring him around to that point of view, but I'd want to be sure that he got there on his own, not because I said he should do that. Aton : In River Notes you seem to use names sparingly - of people and places. Was this a deliberate strategy and if so why? Lopez: It's easier in some situations to create a nameless country than to use the names already established. For stories like those in Winter Count , I'm perfectly comfortable using identifiable places, although even there I tend to work in a rough locale like Nebraska and then make up the names of towns. As far as a deliberate strategy is concerned, this is a complicated ques- tion. A story grows out of you with an order largely its own. It's not really amenable to strategy. Strategy is not something that comes into play in the first draft of a story. Many writers have spoken about this and I concur: I believe that a story is received by a writer. Now, I don't think of the story as an errant soul looking for a repository ; it comes out of somewhere deep inside of you and you alone. But when a story comes, its order is largely established. I think sometimes the reason you finally abandon a story is because you're incapable of working with its logic, or you decide its logic or order is not good. Where strategy does come into play, to some extent, is in a second part of the story - in revision. There you're trying to sharpen the language and point up the surfaces, if you will, as if you were looking at the story as a region, as a geographical entity. You're trying to bring a certain striking scale, for example, to the elements in a story. And in all that work in revi- sion there is some strategy. But even there I would say that's probably not the right word to use. The reason for that is: strategy brings in the notion of guile or didacticism, and those things have no place, as far as I'm con- cerned, in the writing of stories. If you're trying to make a point with a story, you're not really writing a story. You're doing something else. My interest in a story is to illuminate a set of circumstances that bring some understanding of human life, enough at least so that a reader can identify with it and draw some vague sense of hope or sustenance or deep</page><page sequence="6">8 Western American Literature feeling and in some way be revived. So "strategy" is not a good word for me in talking about stories. Atom You spoke earlier about the sense of wonder the landscape inspires and I think of de Crenir and the disciple-like Seurat in "Restora- tion." They seem not to have had it, but the young narrator at least has a potential for feeling it. Lopez: The narrator, who is such a young man, is about to make the same mistake de Crenir made, which is to become so wrapped up in books that he loses contact with the source. He's a young man, but all of us have that capacity to become wrapped up in things. You know, this just sud- denly occurred to me, that part of what that story is about is the conflict of authority, the authority that resides in a book and the authority in the pronghorn antelope. Atom Obviously in your work you recognize both - the authority of science (the book) and the authority of antelope. How do you strike that balance? Lopez : It occurs to me that it's very simple - I hope I'm not fooling myself. You want to find out something so you go to the people who know. I have great regard for this tool that is the scientific method. I have great regard for discipline and rigor applied in areas that are mysterious. For example, one might ask, what is that animal doing ? No one can say, but you can find ways to talk about it. And one of the ways are the method- ologies of field biology. I think in the hands of bright men and women these are good tools for illumination. You can learn a lot about animals this way, but I also think that there are other ways to learn. The question is not which is the right method, but rather which is the disciplined mind and which is the mind making things up. I think that part of the value of education is to realize that no matter what metaphor you use as the principal tool to make your own inquiries into the mysterious nature of life - human life or the life of a Lapland longspur, of a Fremont cottonwood, whatever you look at - that life will remain fundamentally mysterious. What tools will work to elucidate that object? That's where my fondness for science comes in. A ton : How does a person writing about nature - a scientist or a poet - avoid anthropomorphism? Is it possible or only possible to a degree? Lopez : I don't know that anthropomorphism has such negative con- notations for me. It means something that is neither negative nor positive and that is the attribution or the granting of human attributes to animals -</page><page sequence="7">Jim At on 9 consciousness, conscience, compassion, desire, hope, dreams. I don't see anything wrong with that. This is a very old human tradition. I think, however, that there are at least two approaches to this. Some human cultures have no difficulty at all in imagining that animals are innately, really, compassionate, and have dreams and are conscious in the way human beings are conscious or in a similar way, that they are separate but parallel societies. A second approach, generally the approach of our culture, is one full of abstractions. We move through all these abstractions with the help of metaphors and symbols. And we write stories in which symbolic animals act out human roles or have human attributes. I think of gross examples like Animal Farm or Aesop's Fables. They're parts of our literature that incorporate thinking animals. But I'm not interested in an argument - I would walk away - about whether the animals in these stories are actually thinking or not. That seems to be someone examining things with entirely the wrong kind of eye. We are trying to understand ourselves here. Anthropomorphism in science, however, is a difficulty. Science purports to be telling a completely objec- tive truth (of course it doesn't, it's a conceit), and anthropomorphism can create problems with objectivity. Since the value of science is its objectivity, it is important to try to maintain at least a semblance of objective order. We have certain ways to explain the way a tree grows, why the sky is blue, how wolves hunt caribou. We're able to explain to an extent some of these things. But in the end they are mysteries, and I think it is one of the strengths of human wisdom to protect mystery, to not live in a universe where everything is amenable to equations and answers. The answers don't always serve as well as the questions, and unresolved mystery serves us very well. As long as you approach animals with regard, with respect, with a sense that there is a mystery there that you need to confront, then you needn't be concerned with anthropomorphism. It's a concept you can dispense with. Atom In Of Wolves and Men you speak about the preponderance of male metaphors in natural history writing due to the large numbers of males in science. Do we merely need more women researching and writing about natural history or is the problem much larger than that? Lopez : Well, the problem of course is much larger. The simple way to look at this is as follows. Natural history is a science and its goal is to illuminate certain entities and the relationship between those entities - with animals, vegetation, the mineral world or whatever. But natural history is mostly posing questions, and the answers are very hard to come by</page><page sequence="8">10 Western American Literature and extremely hard to generalize about. So I think the intelligent mind would say we should be asking a wide range of good questions and they should come from different parts of the culture. Particularly with wildlife research into the lives of large predatory animals like the polar bear, or a mountain lion, or a wolf or wolverine : in the past the questions have been asked only by men. For reasons neither good nor bad, men ask certain kinds of questions because of the way they grew up, because they have a background in certain areas. They feel comfortable in these areas, so they pose questions in those areas where they are apt to get a good leg up on an answer. Women do the same thing but they're not invited to ask questions very often. The way graduate programs are organized, for example, and the way things go in the scientific world, make it more difficult for women to get into these areas. Maybe they're not interested. That's a possibility. Men aren't going to ask all the good questions. We desperately need to know what other segments of our culture have to say. The same of course is true in regard to aboriginal peoples. Just because they don't subscribe to our kind of science, or they don't have a duplicate taxonomy in natural history - they organize things in different ways - I think it's quite foolish to say they don't know what they are talking about or that they intentionally lie or they don't pay attention. If you've spent time with aboriginal, hunt- ing peoples you've got to be a complete idiot to think that they have been able to survive by not knowing what they're doing. They may not know what we want to know. They may know something else, but the chances are very good if you have patience and tolerance you will be able to discern some of the answers to your own questions by listening to what they have to say. Atom The old myth was that aboriginal cultures were barbaric. Now critics of Western civilization often say that because we have created nuclear weapons, despoiled much of the landscape, and so on, that we are the barbaric ones. How would you view that? Lopez : Every culture has a capacity for barbarism, even those that we lionize or isolate in an idyllic past. Today we talk about American Indians or one culture or another being the one we should all aspire to imitate. This isn't helpful. There is an interesting phrase about Polar Eskimos that's used by a man named Jean Malaurie in a book called The Last Kings of Thüle : "the politics of revenge." He was talking about something that is unfortunately an aspect of native-Anglo relationships in the Arctic. When native peoples</page><page sequence="9">Jim Aton 1 1 feel pressured by Anglos - governing bodies, bureaucrats or whatever - in the area which we call wildlife management, they can create havoc by killing, say, a lot of caribou. This creates a tremendous problem, but some Eskimos enjoy doing it. So Malaurie calls it "the politics of revenge." In other words, the Eskimo is saying, "For so many years you have embar- rassed me and constrained me, made my life horrible. Now I have dis- covered a political way to get the sympathy of the environmental movement or liberals directed against you for daring to criticize me, and I can do anything I want - even something barbaric. And you will be trapped." So you can't simply, across the board, support a culture or a race because you think they do something right. You must make individual judgments about individual people and ask how responsible they were in a situation, not what race they were. Nobody has some genetic endowment that allows him to understand something. Every once in a while in my travels I meet someone who is extremely insightful in this area. I remember once I was stunned by a man named George Noongwook, a Yupik Eskimo living on St. Lawrence Island, in a village called Savoonga. I was there to do a story about walrus hunting. George and I were sitting in his house at a table like this, but instead of a tape recorder it was peanut butter, ammunition and snowmobile parts spread out on the table. The signs of a hunting man and a hunting culture were all over the place. I didn't want to be overbearing, so the conversation was informal, about the trajectory of a .22/250 and so on. Finally I asked a question about a certain kind of hostility on the part of Eskimo hunters and the reason for this. He said, "Are you familiar with the theories of Abraham Maslow?" Just out of the blue, over the peanut butter and ammunition. And I said no. So he spoke about "self actualization," and I thought later, "My God, here is a man who is a good hunter, keeping his family alive on an island in the middle of the Bering Sea and he has also read Abraham Maslow." Now this to me would be a good mind to have around to talk about damn near anything. And occasionally you run into somebody like that. That's what I mean, you've got to be very careful about this business of race. I feel the same way about my own people. I think of the penetrat- ing insight of Darwin, for example, into the relationship of time and biology. We should be proud of that. We could be proud of cathedral architecture. I think Western civilization could have quit right there and said they'd made a major contribution - the creation of a tangible theology. It's an</page><page sequence="10">1 2 Western American Literature awesome, an absolutely awesome focus of mystical, intellectual and physical energy that is the cathedral. Atom You've told me that you're not directly involved in the environ- mental movement. Nevertheless I wonder what you think of the newest group on the scene, Earth First !? Lopez : I have admiration for them because I think certain people in Earth First ! lead with their hearts and call into question this terrible busi- ness of compromise: I'll give you 3 nuclear bombs if you give me 500,000 acres in this wilderness area, or something like that. This is the work of the devil and I think the unadulterated, forthright, no-compromise, saying- what-you-believe stance that Earth First ! takes is admirable. A ton: Do you find in the environmental movement expressions of ego that trouble you? Lopez: Oh, of course. A lot of environmentalists want to own the land in the same way timber barons do. It's just a different kind of owner- ship. And I think it's something you have to be careful with. Nobody can own the land. You know that clichéd line about the older man standing with the young man on the promontory and indicating the landscape with a broad sweep of his hand and saying, "Someday, son, this will all be yours"? The way I think of that line is, "Someday, son, all of this will belong to nobody." Maybe by some miracle we will evolve in such a way that it will not be necessary to own everything. Obviously I am very sympathetic to some of the egotistical expressions in the environmental movement. They're fighting from the downhill posi- tion. The power of the ego is not something to be trifled with, or to be denigrated. I think particularly of being in the Arctic where if you didn't have an assertive ego you'd be dead. I feel very strongly about that. Certainly this isn't as true in cultures that aren't hunting cultures. And certainly people should rein their egos in. But my God, there is a time for the expression of ego. To be a principled individual you must have an ego of some sort. Aton : What about ego and writing? Lopez : To write is an enormous act of ego. But I think you must also be aware of a responsibility that is there. If you're going to speak strongly, you'd better have something strong and important to say. And if you do exert your ego like this, I think you should find some way in your work to help other people realize in themselves the dignity of their own egos. I think nothing makes me feel better, for example at a reading, than</page><page sequence="11">JimAton 13 to see in someone's face as he walks out that he has a greater regard for himself. That's just something that pleases me. I have traditional ideas, maybe some idiosyncratic ones, about stories. I think there is a therapeutic aspect to story. And it's something for the writer to consider. It's hard for writers today to find their way around this business of the cult of the personality, of being caught up in yourself and losing your work. Right after the wolf book came out I happened to meet Peter Matthiessen, whose work I admire very much. We were talking about how important anonymity can be in doing field work for a non-fiction book, and, because I think he is someone who has dealt well with this dilemma, I asked his advice. Atom What did he say about this? Lopez: It had to do with false humility. The problem you face if your work is respected, as I see it at least, is that you must continue to main- tain in your writing a sense of naivete and innocence, even to cultivate a sense of yourself as the one who doesn't know. As long as you do, you don't run the risk of writing the story as though you were the expert. The authority will always be with the subject. And I believe that is important because I believe in the authority of the landscape. I think if you can cultivate a sense of naivete and don't lose as an adult the capacity for wonder Well, any of us can become cynical, inarticulate with pessimism. It's important to me, though, to go into a story with a capa- city for wonder, where I know I can derive something "wonder-full" and then bring this into the story so that a reader can feel it and say, "I am an adult. I have a family, I pay bills, I live in a world of chicanery and subter- fuge and atomic weaponry and inhumanity and round-heeled politicians and garrulous, insipid television personalities, but still I have wonder. I have been brought to a state of wonder by contact with something in a story." I'm going to jump sideways here to finish this business of talking with Matthiessen and about how a writer works. How do you, at the same time you're trying to cultivate a sense of naivete, respond to someone who comes up and says, "I have regard for your work. I take what you say seriously"? When we were talking about it, the way it came out for me was in a visual image - looking squarely at something I'm writing about and feeling somebody here, to the side, looking at me. Not scrutinizing; the gaze is a reminder to live up to what you believe in, the responsibility of the writer to tell the truth, to not compromise what you're doing in order</page><page sequence="12">14 Western American Literature to get some advantage. That's the tension out of which work comes, Matthiessen said, and I think he's correct. Atom I have a poet friend who makes a pretty strong and convincing argument for poetry as the "highest" form of writing. How would you, as a prose writer who often writes for magazines, react to that? Lopez : The distinction I make is between good and bad work. If some- one is a bad poet I cannot understand why you would want to read him over a good magazine writer. I don't understand why the admonition instead is not to take advantage of a good mind wherever you find it. To inculcate students with the notion that all magazine writing - popular magazine writing - is no good. . . . Well, some popular magazines publish a lot of rubbish, but to generalize here is to lose what is good. When I pick up a magazine I hope to read about a subject I'm interested in that has been addressed by somebody with the integrity and skills of, say, a John McPhee: a skill with organization, a patience with interviewing, a gift for expression, for syntax, an ear for idiomatic locution - a pleasing writer to read. It's up to you as a reader to discern among magazines, to express gratification when you come on a good piece. I think it's important, too, to call magazines down, especially in the area of natural history where some people feel free to manipulate or disregard, or to toy with. I don't like to see people make use of animals and landscape for their own ends. Atom I've read many of your magazine pieces that I thought were first rate. Are you thinking of collecting those in a book? Lopez: Actually I have not thought much about it because it seemed presumptuous to me. But this past year several people have mentioned doing this and I've gone back and looked and I think that a collection of good work is possible. I think there are certain pieces I would include. I am very fond of the Anasazi piece in Outside , "Searching for Ancestors." There's a piece in Science 82 called "The Lives of Seals," about the difficulty of killing an animal to learn about it. I think of "A Presentation of Whales" in Harper's about four years ago, another piece in Outside , "A Staging of Snow Geese," and a couple of other articles, an essay in Parabola and an essay in Harper's about narrative and landscape. Some go back a ways. So possibly there's work here that would hold together. I feel very strongly about a collection holding together. You're asking for somebody's time when they read, and if you're going to do that you must have organized it in a certain way.</page><page sequence="13">JimAton 15 Atom Could you describe your writing habits? Lopez : My regular habit of writing is to keep a journal, which I have kept every day since I was 19 years old. These are exercises which remind me of the central concerns of my life, which are language and the metaphor I'm most comfortable with, natural history: the land, the landscape itself, its presence, its bearing. Depending on the sort of piece I'm working on, my time of writing unfolds differently. On a shorter piece I try to work through a first draft entirely in one sitting. I consider that important. Of course it's impossible to do this with longer pieces. So I break those up. But still I tend to work, as much as I can, without interruption, even on long pieces. My habit is to write 4000 or 5000 words a day, then the same amount the next day and the next day, until I'm finished with a section or chapter of a large nonfiction book. For example, the wolf book is broken into four sections. After a long period of preparation, I wrote each one out completely over a period of five days at the rate of about 5000 words per day. That sounds like an enormous output and perhaps it is, but it was the culmination of a great deal of thought, I hope, and preparation, and also I was working from an outline. Although I wrote the book entirely in long hand, other pieces I might work on at the typewriter. Book reviews, for example, I more often do at the typewriter. In fact, there's not much now I do in longhand. Over the years my habits have changed and I'm pretty comfortable now at the type- writer, even during long silences, just sitting there. Atom Are you a "putter-inner" or deleter? Lopez : I find in my work I don't throw away much of a first draft. I do revise repeatedly. I go through a piece six or eight or ten times, what- ever it takes to bring it to a finished point. Also I'm not one to tinker with a story after it's published. I try to find a point at which it's released and it is what it is. Both its success and failure are there and sometimes the failures become obvious to me later, but I'm not inclined to go back and try to revise it. I'm more interested in the work I'm doing than in work I've already done. I tend to proceed almost word by word, even with very long pieces. I pay a great deal of attention to the language I'm using, to the words, the sounds and word placement in the sentences. People sometimes refer to me as a poet, but of course I'm not a poet. I think they do that because they recognize in the prose an attention to the details of the language. But, again, every type of writer should be thinking along these lines.</page><page sequence="14">16 Western American Literature So a lot of very careful revision goes on after a draft is down. I don't tend to add very much or drop very much with a short story. On longer pieces that can change. With the wolf book I think the first draft was 100,000 words and the final draft was about 80,000 words. I took out a lot of material that was just extraneous or slowed the manuscript down too much. Aton : Earlier in our conversation you mentioned the phrase, "the authority of landscape." Could you elaborate on what you mean by that? Lopez : I find a kind of subtle wisdom inherent in landscape. By land- scape I mean the complete lay of the land - the animals that are there, the trees, the vegetation, the quality of the soils, the drainage pattern of water, the annual cycle of temperature, the kinds of precipitation, the sounds common to the region. For example, where I'm sitting now I hear the Swainson's Thrush, but I'm not very likely to hear thunder. I don't live in a region where lightning is very apparent because of the height of the trees; and also we just don't have thunderstorms as one would have, say, in Nebraska. So all these elements come together, in my mind, in a coher- ent way. I think if you can really see the land, if you can lose your sense of wishing it to be what you want it to be, if you can strip yourself of the desire to order and to name and see the land entirely for itself, you see in the relationship of all its elements the face of God. And that's why I say the landscape has an authority. Laurens van der Post, a writer I mentioned earlier, has a keen attach- ment to a place, Africa, and a tremendous compassion for people, particu- larly the people of the Kalahari Desert. He once used the phrase, "the pattern that we call God." I thought that was a wonderfully ecumenical way to express what many of us feel about the world outside ourselves, that there is a pattern we call God, from which all creation derives, which is creation. The authority of the land resides, too, in the unmanipulated quality of its relationships. These relationships have been shaped by evolution. When you look upon them they are neither good nor bad. They are. If you pay close attention you can discern patterns, and perhaps subconsciously those are the patterns of story, stories indigenous to a certain region. I think that certain confused states of the human soul can be understood better by contrasting them or comparing them with various orders visible in the land. Some of this order is discernible to us. We have a nomenclature, we have our taxonomies organized according to a certain frame of mind. We have</page><page sequence="15">JimAton 17 a science of ecology that allows us to put all the named things in some kind of grand order. But a lot that goes on out there is invisible to us. Some of it's visible to science, some of it's visible to mystics, some of it's visible to local inhabitants, but much of it is unreachable, uncontainable. I think of it as having authority because its order is, at least in some places, still innate. It's a part of what we call "God." It is the face of God. an ifvr A TI-"1 CAPRA PRESS -J ifvr HIA A TI-"1 takes pride in presenting I a T T a XT I two bestsellers from the THE a T T iAJN a XT 1940s by Lillian Bos Ross.
