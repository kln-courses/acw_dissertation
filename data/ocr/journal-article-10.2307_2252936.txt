<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mental Activity and Passivity IRVING THALBERG I. What baffles me. The general question I want to dwell upon was incisively formulated, then set aside, by Richard Wollheim. Almost a decade ago, he wondered if there is any way . .. of determining the passivity or otherwise of our inner life, apart, that is, from how it strikes us ... [M]uch of the time our feelings, our emotions, our inclina- tions are as fluctuating or as imperious as if they were not totally under our control. We are elated: we are dejected: we get angry, and then our anger gives place to a feeling of absurdity: . . . we see a stranger . .. who is poor or crippled, and we feel guilt: someone does something wrong or foolish, and we are unaccountably transported by laughter. . ., and then, as unaccountably, we are thrown down (I968, p. 227; see his I967-8, pp. I7, 23f.). Before I look for non-arbitrary criteria to settle philosophically troublesome cases, I should avert some likely misunderstandings. First with regard to my blanket expression 'mental event': I deploy it to cover quite heterogeneous happenings, states, con- ditions, changes and processes. Among such events would be aching, itching, phantasizing, problem-solving, worrying, hoping, deciding. Obviously I must not prejudge our central issue- namely, whether the human being who figures in these events is a doer or something else. So initially I choose a non-committal term, and only assume that mental goings-on 'occur'. As for the ontological status of these events, I will stay clear of the dispute between materialists and mind-body dualists. I leave it open whether the events I discuss could be identical with certain physical happenings-with brain processes, for example. Plainly I would be favouring dualists if I took the adjective 'mental' to mean 'non-physical' or 'immaterial'-whatever those terms mean. Therefore I disavow that semantical hypothesis, and I delineate the class of mental occurrences by means of examples similar to those I gave already. Nothing I say about them should be taken to imply that they are, or that they are not, physical as well. 376</page><page sequence="2">MENTAL ACTIVITY AND PASSIVITY 377 My concept of activity or action is equally open-textured. Clenching one's fist is an instance. Exertion, or hustle and bustle, is not necessary for activity. Suppose that a game of hide-and-go- seek is in progress at a children's birthday party. A girl holds perfectly still behind the curtains. That is also doing something. I assume that individuals who are passive in an event can be either victims or bystanders. The contrast I envisage here is between situations of the following kinds: (i) There is a cloud- burst, and an unfortunate stroller gets drenched by the rain. (ii) Another person is safely indoors, watching the deluge help- lessly-or perhaps sleeping right through it. The victim of the downpour is passive in being soaked, even though he (or she) is dashing wildly for shelter. The observer may start frantically closing windows; nevertheless, as far as the storm is concerned, he (or she) is passive. Whatever the victim does, it has no effect upon his being drenched. Similarly, an observer's action has no influence upon the rain falling around him. Incidentally, these examples reveal that we must specify carefully what event, or what aspect of an event, we have in mind when we say that a participant takes a passive role. Rarely is anyone totally passive. The victim of the downpour is passive inasmuch as he is drenched by it. The bystander is passive with regard to the rainstorm. As we saw in both situations, passivity is defined by reference to the inefficacy of his acts. In the case of victimization, a further element is that the occurrence consists in some natural force or personal agency acting upon the victim. Some human events fall into none of the categories we have mentioned. When I digest my lunch, this is not an act. Nor am I a victim or a bystander of my digestive processes. I hope this explication will avert confusion regarding my key terms. I should also forestall a grumble against my whole inquiry: Am I not simply inviting gratuitous speculation about the status of mental events? What philosophical significance does it have if such occurrences do, or do not, fit into our standard pigeon- holes? My reply will occupy the next three sections. I will show what the stakes are, by cataloguing some live disputes and some appealing doctrines in the philosophy of mind, especially in action theory, all of which turn upon unargued, perhaps unwar- ranted, assumptions about the typing of various mental occur- rences. For brevity, I deal only with rudimentary examples. The more complex cases, where an inanimate object or another person</page><page sequence="3">378 IRVING THALBERG: frightens us, motivates us, or inflicts pain on us, seem to me exceedingly tricky. My hunch is that such cases might span-just as wide a range as do examples of overt behaviour which results from some person or thing acting upon us. But we have enough puzzles without taking on that issue. 2. Categorizing the mental antecedents of action. Countless philo- sophers and legal theorists define an action as a contraction of our muscles, or a motion or stillness of our body, which has resulted from certain mental goings-on: episodes of volition, perhaps; or bouts of desiring and believing, wanting, practical reasoning and the like. By contrast, a few writers prefer to define action, not as the effect of some psychological occurrence of this kind, but as a compound event: the corporeal happening, plus its mental antecedent. A variant of this latter theory is Roderick Chisholm's view that action consists of the bodily occurrence, together with a display of 'agent causation' by Which the person makes his brain and limbs react (Chisholm, I966, pp. I7, 2I, 23, 29). Similarly, Arthur Danto sees action as an overt bodily 'event which is done', along with the presumably mental 'doing of the event' (I973, pp. 39, 44, 47, 63, 7I-78, I I9). Finally, some metaphysicians deny that corporeal happenings are even part of action; their belief is that a deed only, or primarily, consists of a volitional event. Thus H. A. Prichard insisted that 'to act is really to will something', and that 'a human action ... is an activity of willing some change' (I949, pp. I90, I92). Prichard's latter-day follower, Hugh McCann, defends a nearly identical thesis, viz., that the bodily actions of men typically involve a mental action of volition or willing, and that such mental acts are, in at least one important sense, the basic actions we perform when we do things like raise an arm.. . (I974, p. 45I). While a causal theorist appears to be defining action in non- action terms-as a 'bodily movement'-Prichard and McCann seem to be proposing a different kind of reduction. They do not want to eliminate action concepts. Rather, they want to compress the seeming variety of actions into just one 'basic' type: 'an activity of willing'. I am unsure what sort of reduction Chisholm and Danto are trying to achieve. That is immaterial, however. The interesting activity-passivity question about all these doctrines is whether the kind of mental event that each postulates</page><page sequence="4">MJENTAL ACTIVITY AND PASSIVITY 379 is itself an action. Specifically: have Prichard or McCann demon- strated that volitional events are always things we do? If they have, then neither a causal theorist, nor Chisholm and Danto, can possibly reduce action to something else. At most, a causal theorist will have defined physical deeds as the effects of mental capers; and Chisholm and Danto will have only equated bodily action with a mixture of mental action and physiological happening. We will try to make some headway with this enigma in section 5. For the moment we should notice another problem in action theory regarding the active ar passive nature of mental events. This one was noticed by Donald Davidson. He would like to give a causal definition of what it is to be able, or free, to perform an action of some type. Davidson considers it 'natural to say that a person can do something (or is free to do it) if all that is required, if he is to do it, is that he will [or choose, or try, etc.] to do it' (I972, p. I39). But Davidson thinks Chisholm (I964, pp. 20-25) has spotted a major defect in any causal definition of someone's ability or freedom to act which has this conditional form. The hitch is that the mental event we nominate-willing, choosing, trying-may itself appear to be 'an act distinct from doing' whatever it is that an agent is free to do; consequently, Davidson says: 'the' question would then arise [whether] an agent is free to will', choose or try (1972, p. I39). More precisely, the conditional statement we quoted may be true, because if a man were to [will], choose or try to perform some action, then he would perform that action, [but] nevertheless he' might be unable to [will,] choose or try, in which case, he couldn't perform the action (p. I43f.)1 Our difficulty is that the conditional statement is supposed to define an agent's power to act; yet the statement is true in circum- stances where he seems to lack that power. So this kind of defini- tion fails. Davidson offers one 'hope for the causal analysis' of freedom to act. We should find states or events . .. which are not themselves actions or events about which the question whether the agent can perform them can intelligibly be raised. The most eligible I When I continue to refer to the same work, I shall not repeat its date of publication, but shall only give the page numbers.</page><page sequence="5">380 IRVING THALBERG: such states or events are the beliefs and desires. . . [whose] propositional expressions provide an account of the reasons the agent had in acting (p. I47). Unfortunately, Davidson furnishes no evidence for his assertion that 'beliefs and desires' are never actions, and that we cannot meaningfully ask if someone is able to perform them. Furthermore, another well-known theorist of freedom, who appears to be working with an equally causal template, emphatically assigns some desires to the 'active' basket. Harry Frankfurt's thesis is that 'a person is active with respect to his own desires when he identifies with them... Without such identification the- person is a passive bystander to his desires and to what he does' (I975, p. I2I; see his I97I and I972). Elsewhere Frankfurt extends his distinction to 'intellectual processes' and 'passions' generally: Turning one's mind in a certain direction, or deliberating systematically about a problem, are activities in which a person himself engages. But to some of the thoughts that occur in our minds ... we are mere passive bystanders.... [There are] passions with respect to which we are active and [others] with respect to which we are passive (I976, pp.240 f.). Ultimately, however, Frankfurt confesses himself unable to spell out what he means when he says that someone 'identifies with' a desire, thought or passion (I976, pp.245-5I; see I975, p. I2I). Frankfurt's perplexities about 'identification' are not our topic. The activity-passivity problem for us is whether we can find rational grounds to accept Davidson's claim that one's desires are never actions, or Frankfurt's belief that sometimes 'a person is active with respect to his own desires'. But instead of replying straightaway to this and our previous question about the mental antecedents of action, we should briefly register two 'passivity' riddles. 3. Is emotion passive? Recall how traditional faculty psychologists used to split up the person into Reason, Will and Passion or Emotion. Presumably desire got squeezed into the latter com- partment. At any rate, the consensus was that an individual does his thinking and willing, but somehow undergoes his terrors,</page><page sequence="6">MENTAL ACTIVITY AND PASSIVITY 38I worries, rages, hankerings and appetites. His emotions and desires seemed to operate like surging flood-waters, ferocious winds, uncontrollable flames, unruly saddle-horses, or citizens rebelling against their government. The guiding idea is that they overpower us, and tug or propel us along with them. The quotation from Wollheim that I began with reflects this traditional imagery, when we are said to be 'unaccountably transported' by mirth, and 'as unaccountably ... thrown down'. My concern is not stylistic and antiquarian, however. What interests me is that some very astute philosophers of mind cling to fragments of this picture of emotion. Richard Peters, for example, believes that we typically deploy the term 'emotion' and its derivatives . . . when we speak of judgments being disturbed, clouded or warped by emotion, of people being not properly in control of their emotions, being subject to gusts of emotion, being emotionally per- turbed. The suggestion in such cases is always that some- thing comes over people . .. Emotions, like the weather, come over (I96I-2, pp. II9f.). He concludes: 'We naturally use the term "emotional" and its derivatives to pick out our passivity' (I96I-2, pp. II9-I2I). Richard Taylor expounds a similar thesis in an ethics book. He argues: One can do certain things ... but emotions can only ... be 'suffered' . . . One can ... move his limbs, voluntarily, or even pursue a certain train of thought, voluntarily; but one can in no similar way feel elation or dejection . . . [O]ne could be commanded ... to swing his arms (an action) but could not intelligibly be commanded to love or hate (passions) (I97ob, p. 24I). The upshot is that 'Love and compassion are passions, not actions, are therefore subject to nor rule or command, and can in no way be represented in terms of duties or moral obligations' (p. 252). A few philosophers dissent from this 'passivity' account of emotion. Most recently, Robert Solomon has championed a theory which he claims to derive from Kant, Scheler and Sartre, to the effect 'that our emotions are interpretive judgments . . . con- stitutive interpretations of the world. . .' (I977, p. 46). Solomon</page><page sequence="7">382 IRVING THALBERG: emphasizes that 'we make judgments' of this and all other types (I977, p. 47). He explains: ... by 'judgment', I do not necessarily mean 'deliberative judgment'. Many judgments ... are made without delibera- tion. (One might call such judgments 'spontaneous' as long as 'spontaneity' isn't confused with 'passivity'.) But ... many emotions are deliberative judgments. We literally 'work ourselves up' to anger or love ... but whether delibera- tive or 'spontaneous', getting angry or 'falling in' love are things that we do ... (p. 46). The only non-active aspects of emotion that Solomon counten- ances are the 'physiological reaction, the pumping of adrenalin, . . . for example, with the resultant sensations and feelings'; but he denies that there is anything 'essential to the emotion about them'; for 'the emotion is the judgment . . . Intense feelings are the effect of intense emotions, not their essence' (p. 47). As previously, we will not explore details of the 'passivity' account by Peters and Taylor, or Solomon's contrary outlook. Instead, we should ask exactly what these rival theorists are asserting. What could count in favour of, or against their views? For instance, on the 'passivity' hypothesis, what sort of thing might 'come over people' who are anxious or ashamed? What does Taylor mean when he says that emotions are 'suffered'? Generally, what is supposed to act upon us, and in what manner, when we have emotions? As for Solomon's 'active' thesis, evidently it should be supported by an argument which shows that judging is always a mental performance. Solomon offers no proof of this; but luckily the volition theorist McCann does attempt to demonstrate that all thinking-hence judgmental thinking-is an activity (see section 5). Before we plunge into those issues, however, we should take note of our second activity-passivity conundrum. 4. Is our unconscious mental life passive? This riddle is about the status of those occurrences that depth-psychologists call 'uncon- scious primary processes'. Peters himself suggests that there are 'affinities' between his theory of emotion and some key Freudian doctrines (I96I-2, p. I29). For instance, Peters believes his own passivity model would explain [defective or faulty] actions gnrd performances (e.g., characteristic errors and distortions</page><page sequence="8">MENTAL ACTIVITY AND PASSIVITY 383 of thought, perception and memory, motor slips and break- downs) and goings-on like dreaming and hysteria which do not rank as performances or actions at all (p. I33). Here is Peters' view of unconscious repression and projection: In repression the traumatic experience just passes out of the sufferer's mind; he does not wittingly put it out of his mind. Similarly a man who projects his fears on to something does not wittingly rig his environment. He just comes to see the world under an aspect such as that of threat. The phenomena ... are indubitably mental ... but fall into the category of passivity (p. I3I). Once again, I think the wisest policy would be to set out what it might mean to assert than an individual is passive with regard to the unconscious occurrences postulated by Freud. Peters' examples merely present us as not active: not purposely expelling a traumatic memory from our minds, not intentionally making our environment seem threatening. But it is question-begging to infer from our non-activity that we must be passive in these cases. The problem before us, after all, is to decide if it makes sense to speak of either passivity or activity of people with respect to mental events. So from the premise that we are not active in repression or projection, it is illegitimate to conclude that we are passive. Have we any independent reasons to suppose that unconscious processes like repression and projection 'fall into the category of passivity'? For what it is worth, my impression is that Freud himself rarely classifies unconscious phenomena in this way. One positive example I found is in an early work of his. There, Freud seems uncertain what to make of the violent symptoms displayed by a hysteria sufferer: 'someone in a state which bears all the signs of a painful affect . . . weeping, screaming and raging'. But Freud speculates that 'a process is going on in him of which these physical phenomena are the appropriate expression'. At that point, Freud speaks of the patient as 'overcome by an affect about whose cause he asserts that he knows nothing', while nevertheless 'behaving as though he does know it' (see Strachey, I953-74, III, p. I9; first emphasis added). I believe that usually Freud does not see us as 'overcome'. Characteristically, he regards both aberrant and so-called normal</page><page sequence="9">384 IRVING THALBERG: states of mind as situations of dynamic conflict. The tension he envisages is either between quasi-physical ite-ms and forms of 'energy' lurking within the 'mental apparatus' (XIV, p. I75), or else among anthropomorphic 'thought-constructing agencies' (V, p. 676). The person is not a party to these conflicts. Rather, accord- ing to later Freudian theory, within each person is an ego, which 'has ... the task of representing the external world to the id', and of dealing with the id's 'instinctual needs'. Freud compares the 'ego's relation to the id .. . with that of a rider to his horse ... [O]ften ... the rider is obliged to guide the horse along the path by which it itself wants to go' (XXII, pp. 75, 73' 77)- When, 'following the dictates of its super-ego', the ego repressively denies 'motor discharge' to an 'instinctual impulse' from the id, trouble may ensue. The impulse may create 'for itself substitutive grati- fication (a symptom . . .)', which the ego again attempts to stifle, 'and all this together produces the clinical picture of a neurosis . . (XIX, pp. Isof.). Notice, however, that the person, not his ego, becomes neurotic-as a result of discord, of which he is uncon- scious, between his ego and its concitoyens. The person is not pas- sively acted upon by an 'instinctual impulse' or by a dictatorial super-ego. Only the ego suffers this fate. At least this seems to be Freud's view of mental activity and passivity. He appears to be implying that the person in whom unconscious primary processes occur is neither active nor passive toward them. Only the denizens of his mental apparatus might be so depicted. But even if my exegesis is correct, our philosophical question is still open. It should read, in Wollheim's phraseology: Have we 'any way . . . of determining the passivity or otherwise of our inner life' when primary processes are unfolding? In other words: Are we, or some of the forces and agencies within us, either victims or bystanders? Now that we have seen how similar problems crop up regarding the mental events which figure in theories of action, freedom and emotion, it is time to look for answers. I start with the most impassioned and detailed argument I have come across for an 'active' account of cognition. 5. Thinking: a paradigm case of mental activity? McCann, the volition theorist I alluded to in section a, has the simplest reply to all our questions. If you work through his table-thumping dialectics, you will realize that he sees all mental occurrences as activities. His suggestion is that it is 'preferable to speak of most</page><page sequence="10">MENTAL ACTIVITY AND PASSIVITY 385 mental behavior as action' (1974, p. 473). But he fails to delineate a single case of mental non-action; and the only psychical occur- rence he examines at length-thinking and its alleged volitional species-he declares repeatedly to be active. Consequently I read his 'most' as 'all'. The cornerstone of McCann's argument is his analysis of what he calls 'bodily actions' into a pair of component events: a 'result' and a 'bringing about' of the 'result'. In McCann's technical idiom, a 'result' of any kind of overt act is an event of some type which must take place, because of the way we define that kind of act. Now in ordinary speech the result of your jogging today might be perspiration or loss of weight. But these would not be (results' in McCann's book, since it is logically possible for some-. one to run without sweating or losing weight. In McCann's lexicon, the requisite motion of your legs would be a 'result' of your jogging. So obviously his 'results' are not among the effects of our deeds. Your jogging does not cause agitation of your legs; you would not be jogging at all if they were motionless. As for the other element of your 'bodily actions', your 'bringing about', McCann takes it to be the willing of a 'change or sequence of changes' (pp. 467ff.). Although your 'bodily action' of jogging does not cause the 'result' of jogging (leg motion), McCann assumes that your volitional 'bringing about' of this 'result' does causally engender it. How does this 'result'/'bringing about' analysis help bolster an 'active' theory of volitional and other forms of thinking, such as Solomon's affective judging? McCann uses it to argue, first, that an episode of 'bringing about' cannot be decomposed into a 'result' plus a further 'bringing about'; and secondly, that thinking is a 'bringing about'. Consequently, 'bringing about' generally lacks a 'result' of its own, in McCann's sense of that term, and thinking in particular has no 'result'. This is crucial: McCann is denying, in effect, that there is any type of mental event-what many writers would call a 'thought process'-which must occur, because of the way we define 'thinking', whenever cognition takes place. From a commonsense standpoint, it would seem that we either do, or do not, initiate any particular episode of cognition. McCann wants to eliminate the latter alternative. He shows his hand when he consider the familiar distinction between cases where a thought occurs to me by happenstance, and cases where I think of something I3</page><page sequence="11">386 IRVING THALBIERG' deliberately. For example, the thought of the number i might occur to me as part of a reverie about my first day in school . . ., or I might think of i purposely, in constructing [an] . . . example (p. 464). McCann's treatment of this dichotomy is so perplexing that I shall have to quote most of it. He asserts: while these examples do illustrate a need for a distinction between two types of thinking, they do not undermine the claim that thinking does not have a result, for the distinction [we need] is not to be drawn in those terms. The word 'thought' . . . can mean either the actual process of thinking of some content. . . or the content itself [here, the number i]. Now since the content is not an event and so cannot be brought about, the only sense that can be attached to the claim that I bring about my thought of i in the second example is that I bring about my thinking of I ... [What] is brought about can only be the action itself ... ... [W]hat occurs to me [in the first case] is only the number, not my thinking of it, and the case could as well be described as one in which I come to the thought of i, which sounds a good deal less passive (pp. 464f.). McCann goes on to remind us that 'volition too is thought: and hence not possessed of a result' (p. 466). But is his reasoning plausible? It would be a digression to ask how the number one could occur to me without my thinking of it. The major flaw of McCann's argument is more obvious. He has simply refused to face the tough cases for a mental 'activist': thoughts which we say are haunting us, tormenting us, distracting us, of which we cannot seem to rid ourselves. McCann also ignores the volitional analogues of such apparently non-active thinking: insistent urges which seem to spring up within us and to escape our control. These impulses and longings appear alien, inasmuch as they conflict with what we suppose ourselves to really want to do. However they should be described, McCann says nothing to prove them akin to his favoured acts of will. Instead, he tendentiously rules that 'there is no difference between an act of volition occurring on my part [i.e., within me] and my performing such an act' (p. 466, my italics). But isn't the question whether such mental occurrences invariably amount to acts? In another passage,</page><page sequence="12">MENTAL ACTIVITY AND PASSIVITY 387 McCann once more tries to eliminate the possibility of a 'difference' between those volitional goings-on which are deeds and those which are mere processes within us. His edict reads: 'The only thing that can count as a process . . . when volition takes place is the volitional act itself . . . [and] no other mode of thought is quite like it' (p. 468). In particular, he denies that wanting and wishing resemble willing (p. 468). Plainly, the defect of McCann's reasoning, as exemplified by the lengthy quotations I have given, is that it merely asserts and re-affirms his 'active' thesis about cognition and other mental occurrences. Some earlier writings by Richard Taylor should have provoked McCann to offer more of an argument. For Taylor's contrary intuition is that there exists 'a clear difference between the thoughts that merely occur within me and those which are within my control' (I966, p. 58). Taylor's examples of 'entirely passive' cognition are 'dreams, reveries, and thoughts that are simply evoked by eternal stimuli' (p. I55). At the end of section i, I foreswore discussion of the latter sort of phenomena. But I agree with Taylor that externally evoked 'thoughts' are initially plausible examples. So are dreaming and fantasizing. In contrast to McCann, Taylor attempts to spell out what he means by 'control' and its absence. One mark of the former is that if it 'were ... not for my actively thinking' certain thoughts, 'they would be most unlikely to occur at all' (p. 59). Along the same lines, Taylor might have added that one characteristic of the morbid, disgusting, distressing or otherwise unwelcome thoughts which seem to plague me at times, or to 'merely occur within me', is that they are equally 'unlikely' to vanish when I try to focus on pleasanter topics instead. Here are the main situations imagined by Taylor to illustrate psychic passivity and activity. First, suppose I have a luncheon appointment for tomorrow with a man whose name ('Shilling') has eluded me for several days. If the name 'just comes to mind suddenly, unsought, when I am entirely preoccupied with other things', then this cognitive event seems not to be anything I did (197oa, p. 273). Similarly, if another person asks me, out of the blue, 'Are you lunching with Shilling?', Taylor believes that 'his utterance . . . would simply cause the name to occur to me', and in Taylor's opinion I am passive (p. 273). In Taylor's active case, the thinker is aware that the missing name has some connection with British currency; therefore he goes over the names of British</page><page sequence="13">388 IRVING THALBERG: coins, with the express purpose of unblocking his recalcitrant memory. No doubt McCann would accept this illustration of mental doing; but he failed to provide us any reasons to dismiss its seemingly 'passive' counterparts. Since our objective has been to find criteria with which to classify various mental events, we should ask if it is possible to derive such criteria from Taylor's discussion. I am afraid not. Taylor's examples themselves seem to presuppose that sometimes my thinking is under my command, and other times uncontrollable. When Taylor describes himself as 'entirely preoccupied with other things', that sounds like active cogitation-which is interrupted when the elusive name 'just comes to mind'. In Taylor's other 'passive' example, we have to make the contrary assumption that I am not actively seeking clues to the name at the moment when somebody's question 'simply cause[s] the name to occur to me'. If we leave out this assumption, the case may not seem altogether passive. On the other side, Taylor's story of 'active' remembering clearly involves the further mental activity of silently reviewing the names of English coins. For his part, Taylor concedes that 'there is no good, non- question-begging analysis' of what it is, in general, to do something (I966, p. I53). He admits: it is difficult to see how thinking can [sometimes] be an act, but ... it is no more difficult than seeing how just raising one's arm . .. can be an act. The metaphysical peculiarities [sic] are not produced by regarding thought as an activity; they are only duplicated . . . (I97oa, p. 28z). Perhaps, but with regard to mental passivity, I suspect we face 'metaphysical peculiarities' which do not surround overt passive behaviour. More of that shortly. For now we should draw an important negative conclusion, which bears on our problems about the mental events which figure in analyses of action and freedom: We have not yet discovered rational grounds to assert that an episode of thinking, or any other psychological occurrence, is under one's control-something one does. We certainly cannot adopt the procedure of some causal theorists who define an overt action as the bodily result of such mental events as wanting, think- ing, desire and belief, or whatever. A theory of overt action might stop there. But if we are interested in mental acts, we would immediately focus upon the causal theorist's favoured mental</page><page sequence="14">MENTAL ACTIVITY AND PASSIVITY 389 event-for instance, wanting. We would surely ask: Is wanting an act? If so, what makes it one? If the causal theorist of mental action says that wanting-in general, or in a particular case- is something we do, then his pattern of analysis requires him to postulate yet another antecedent or simultaneous episode of hankering after the ground-level episode of wanting; and so on ad infinitum. On the other hand, if he denies that wanting is an act, we will inquire how such a mental occurrence can transmute its mental or bodily effects into actions. If an episode of wanting is not under control, not something we do, how can it extend our mastery to its mental or physical products? Plainly, neither McCann's line of reasoning, nor a variant of the causal analysis, has elucidated our notion of mental activity. I doubt that we will fare any better with the other side of this dichotomy. 6. What might mental passivity be like? So far we have mostly toyed with cases of some natural force acting upon people, or simply 'acting' while bystanders gape helplessly. In our search for mental equivalents of victimization and bystanding, we should avoid the side-issue of whether natural forces can be said to act. Hence we might profitably shift to a fresh example. Imagine that a kidnapper is whisking his (or her) prey into a getaway car. The victim's change of location-from sidewalk to automobile-is principally an effect of the gangster's energetic pummelling and shoving. But except for stimulating the eyes and ears of by- standers, the kidnapper's skullduggery does not causally influence the situation of people who are merely on hand. As we said earlier, they qualify as bystanders whether or not they pay attention to the incident that unfolds before them, and regardless whether they react with fear, indignation, or total indifference. Their passivity consists in the fact that they do nothing to aid or impede the abductor. They do not facilitate his task, for instance by opening the car door-or by joining him and participating as fellow kidnappers in the abduction. As we remarked initially, neither a victim nor a bystander has to be totally supine; he must only not contribute causally to the event at issue. If the concept of mental passivity is to make sense, we must specify counterparts for all or most of these elements. But can we? Take the passivity of someone who is acted upon. What, in the psychical realm, might 'come over' us, in the way a kidnapper</page><page sequence="15">390 IRVING THALBERG: pounces upon us, and rain soaks us? It is fairly plain how kid- nappers and rain bring about various changes in their victim's situation. But even if we postulate internal forces and agencies within us-floods of emotion, a lusty id, a puritanical super- ego-we have no inkling how they might affect us. At most we could meaningfully talk of the effects they have on each other; and then we must ignore their modus operandi. The upshot is that we have no more than a model for the way items within a person may victimize each other. We have not clarified what it might be for anything to 'come over' the person himself or herself. Do we fare better with the other kind of passivity, which requires only that the person be around when events occur? This is surely what Frankfurt was alluding to in the passage I quoted in section 2, when he said that if an individual does not identify himself 'with the desire that moves him', he remains 'a passive bystander to his desires and to what he does'. Similarly, when we postulate some unconscious primary mental process going on within people, we easily picture them as ignorant or inattentive bystanders. Nevertheless overt and internal bystanding are not obviously comparable. We said, for instance, that the passive witness of a kidnapping is someone who fails to intervene. However, we can imagine him doing so, or attempting to. Now suppose we cast ourselves in the role of spectator to the emotions, ambitions and unconscious urges that flood our mind. What would it be like for us to interfere, rather than gape or turn away? We need a contrast between merely being present, as opposed to entering the fray. If internal bystanding does not rule out this or any other active kind of opposite, what does it amount to? This is a minor, and perhaps non-fatal obscurity of our account. There is a more fundamental defect to our bystanding model of mental passivity-and to any victimization model par dessus le march'. To illustrate, suppose we are bystanders, or even victims, when embarrassment, rage, lust or an 'instinctual impulse' rushes through our mind. What could it possibly mean to say that these happenings constitute our shame, our fury, our craving, much less our 'instinctual impulse'? The bystanding model is useless, and so is the imagery of being acted upon. The reason for this is clear. Suppose that Jane is drenched by a cloudburst or spirited away by mnobsters. We would never say that this was Jane's downpour of Jane's kidnapping. Unless some malicious trickster made the rain fall upon Jane, these events have no author or owner at all.</page><page sequence="16">MENTAL ACTIVITY AND PASSIVITY 39I You certainly would not attribute the storm to witnesses. The abduction, as well, has nothing to do with casual gawkers. From a legal standpoint, it is only the gangster's misdeed. Generally, it would seem, we cannot attribute an event to individuals whose role in it is passive. We cannot identify it as the victim's or the bystander's, in the way we can declare that an active participant is its author. This reasoning carries over directly to the 'passive' account of emotions and unconscious processes. If I am either a victim or a bystander of these mental occurrences, what -could it mean to call them 'mine'? I just happen to be in their way or in their vicinity. Speaking vaguely: they do not reflect me, or display my character- traits, in the manner that those events do in which I am active. It would be a sheer coincidence that I happen to be overcome by these emotions and unconscious processes. And if you suppose that I unwittingly seek them out, as an accident-prone individual sets things up so that he will be injured, you are departing from the passivity model of emotions and unconscious processes. I conclude that neither the victimization nor the bystanding accounts make sense of these central aspects of our mental lives. 7. Verdicts. In sections 2, 3 and 4, we saw that there are bona fide and well-entrenched problems about the status of certain psycho- logical occurrences. The events, and doctrines regarding their active or passive nature, are prominent in theories of action generally, and free action particularly, as well as in accounts of emotion and hypotheses concerning unconscious processes. We sifted out two groups of specific questions from the ongoing debates in these areas. The first group of questions had to do with alleged cases of mental activity, the second with cases of seeming passivity. In section 5, we examined the most promising argument on record for the view that we do our thinking, our willing and pre- sumably kindred things like judging. Ultimately we decided that it provides us no convincing reason to classify any psychological episode as active. Nor did we find ourselves able to derive criteria from the usually accepted kind of examples. We attempted to contrive our own account of mental passivity in section 6, but again encountered difficulty. It remains obscure what it would be like for someone to be either a victim or a bystander of his (or her) emotions and unconscious processes.</page><page sequence="17">392 IRVING THALBERG: By way of summary, I shall set out first the 'activity' questions we focused on, then those about passivity, together with our considered verdicts. I begin with the most extreme theses about psychological events that we came across: (Ia) Should we, following McCann's suggestion, regard all 'mental behaviour', or at least all thinking, 'as action'? No, since we were unpersuaded by McCann's attack upon the commonsense distinction between thinking which I initiate, and a thought which merely 'occurs to me'. Furthermore, his demonstration that thinking is always an act turned out to be a rather brazen defini- tional maneuvre, which met none of the difficult cases. (Jb) Is volition or willing always an action, never a mere process within us-as Prichard, McCann, and even Davidson suppose? Only McCann tried to prove this, in the course of his argument that thinking is active. However, neither his general reasoning, nor his contention that 'there is no difference between an act of volition occurring on my part, and my performing such an act', seemed decisive-or even relevant. (Ic) Is Frankfurt warranted in supposing a person is 'active with respect to his own desires', as well as his intellectual processes and his passions, 'when he identifies with them'? No, because Frankfurt himself quite rightly concedes that his 'notion of identi- fication is . .. a bit mystifying', and that he is 'uncertain how to go about explicating it' (I975, p. I2I). Consequently we should not expect his approach to settle these issues. (Id) Is Davidson right in maintaining the negative thesis that desire is never an action 'about which the question whether the agent can perform' it may be raised? One snag to his position is that it presupposes the very contrast we are challenging, between episodes of desire and other mental events-Davidson mentions willing, trying and choosing-which he takes to be actions. A more serious difficulty is that Davidson makes no effort to prove -that we cannot 'intelligibly' ask if an agent is capable of desiring such-and-such. The question does not sound especially non- sensical-albeit a deeper analysis might show that it is. (Je) Can we safely assume that Chisholm's 'immanent causation', and Danto's 'doing' of a bodily event, are not forms of mental activity? Again the issue is unresolved. Therefore we risk cir- cularity if we define overt action as physical happenings plus the agent's immanent causing, or 'doing' of those happenings. Needless to say, we incur the same risk if we adopt the eternally popular</page><page sequence="18">MENTAL ACTIVITY AND PASSIVITY 393 causal theory, and define actions as certain muscular or bodily goings-on which result from practical reasoning, desire and belief, or whatever; as noted, we lack proof that these mental events are not themselves actions. (Ila) Turning to the other pole of our dichotomy, should we regard ourselves as the passive victims of our emotions and uncon- scious primary process? In this instance, we can go a little beyond our previous conclusions of 'not proven'. The 'passivity' thesis in question seemed empty, since we could suggest nothing in the mental arena which might act upon us, in the clear-cut way that kidnappers act upon their prey. (Ilb) Could someone be passive toward his emotions and un- conscious processes in the way that an oblivious or an observant bystander is passive during a catastrophe? This is more plausible on its face than the victimization model of passivity. Nevertheless there are obscurities to it. Unlike a spectator during an abduction, we do not seem to have the option of abandoning our passive stance and getting involved; for what would it be like for us either to help or to hinder the depredations of our moods and our unconscious processes? Moreover, if we have a merely bystanding relationship to our emotions and unconscious processes, we shall be at a loss to explain what makes them 'ours'. (IJc) Should we agree with the handful of philosophers who reject any kind of 'passivity' doctrine, and consider emotions to be judgments that we actively 'make'? The principal contemporary defender of this account, Robert Solomon, offers no proof; and the general arguments for mental activity, by McCann and by Frankfurt, are no more conclusive about emotion than they are about thinking and desire. So this question is up in the air. (Ild) Could our ego, or some other dramatis persona of Freudian theory, serve either as passive victim, or as passive bystander, while our emotions and our id run wild? These hypotheses are not empty, at least if we see emotion psychoanalytically, as some kind of psychic force or energy operating within our mental apparatus. Conceivably, this psychic current might act upon our ego and other terrified denizens. Alternatively, they could look on or turn away while it operates. As bystanders, our ego and other agencies would have the option of entering the fray. Of course, the difficulty registered at the end of section 6 would re- main: it would be unclear what makes rampaging emotions and unconscious processes 'ours'. Still this, conjecture is the most</page><page sequence="19">394 IRVING THALBERG: meaningful of those we have surveyed about mental activity and its opposite. Overall, we discovered no 'way ... of determining the passivity or otherwise of our inner life'. The only small hope is that psycho- analytical researchers will eventually reveal which items act on which others, and how they achieve their effects; or which items stand by, and what options for involvement these bystanders have. By contrast with this uncertainty about the status of psychological occurrences, we can decide readily in many overt situations. For example, an alpinist is near the top of a slope; shortly thereafter he (or she) is at the bottom. If his rapid descent was principally caused by a rush of falling snow, then he was passively acted upon. If the main cause was his own leaping from one foot to another, then he had an active role in his change of altitude. What qualifies his leaping as overt action? Here we can go along with causal theorists, and say that this bodily event results from the hiker's wanting to leap. Then we can refuse to classify the wanting. Or we can connect leaping with various concepts and social practices which only concern overt action, never victimiza- tion, bystanding or mere occurrences like digestion. For instance, young people gradually learn to hop and jump. Ballet dancers are trained to leap, and receive praise for doing so gracefully, or censure for clumsiness. There are correct and incorrect methods for high jumping and broad jumping. We can practice these methods. An athlete may be held responsible by his or her coach and team-mates for a particular leap. People have or lack the ability, opportunity, means and right to leap at a given time-say to parachute while an aeroplane is in flight. We understand how injuries and fatigue affect our ability to leap. On the linguistic side, you can meaningfully order a sky-diver to leap. None of these things hold true of victims. With bystanding there are some exceptions to this asymmetry. The imperative, 'Don't get in- volved, just observe what happens !' is intelligible; so is 'Don't get involved, and don't pay any attention to what happens !'. People do have opportunity and authority to be present during certain occurrences-surgical operations, for example. Otherwise, it makes no better sense to order someone to be kidnapped than to digest his lunch. It is absurd to suppose that injuries spoil one's ability to be kidnapped or to be present at some occurrence. And so on for learning, training methods, rehearsing, and the like.</page><page sequence="20">MENTAL ACTIVITY AND PASSIVITY 395 I admit that these are only rustic marks of overt activity and passivity. They are neither comprehensive nor immune to counter- examples. However, for the supposed mental analogues of doing, undergoing and merely being present, we lack even such rough- and-ready criteria. So until we encounter more compelling arguments for this distinction within the psychological realm, I think we would avoid gratuitous mysteries if we confine activity and passivity to the physical world.
