<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. [These Notes (by various hands) do not exclude Critical Notices later onb.] Natural Inheritance. By FRANCIS GALTON, F.R.S. London: Manmillan &amp; Co., 1889. Pp. x., 259. "The inquiry of which this book is the result relates to the inheritance of ordinary qualities by successive generations of a people, and it is carried on by more refined and searching methods than those usually employed. It is based on the fact that the characteristics of any popu- lation which lives in harmony with its environment remain statistically identical during successive generatioiis. It was easy to see in a vague way that an equation admitted of being based on this fact; also that the equation might serve to suggest a theory of descent, while no theory of descent that failed to satisfy it could possibly be true. A large part of the book is occupied in putting this equation into working order; in the course of which operation numerous obstacles had to be confronted in turns, and then to be either evaded or overcome. The final result was that the higher methods of statistics, which consist in applications of the law of Frequency of Error, were found to be eminently suitable for expressing the course of heredity. By their aid the desired equation was thrown into an exact form, and-it became easy to compare its various consequences, obtained through calculation, with the observed facts. In all cases the results proved to be consistent. The nearness of the various degrees of kinship was incidentally determined with numerical precision, as well as the average contribution from the personality of each ancestor to the total heritage of the child, as distinguished from what he might transmit in a latent form. Much insight was also ob- tained into the proportion between the latent and the personal elements in each individual. In the preliminary chapters relating to the pro- cesses of heredity, new light was thrown on the tendency of some elements to become blended in descent, and in others to be mutually exclusive; also on primary and secondary orders of typical stability; on the infertility of mixed types, and on numerous other topics." Critical Notice will follow. Letters of David Hume to William Strahan. Now first edited with Notes, Index, &amp;c., by G. BIRKBECK HILL, D.C.L., Pembroke College. Ox- ford: Clarendon Press, 1888. Pp. lv., 386. This collection of Letters from Hume to the printer of his works from 1756 onwards - saved from dispersion by Lord Rosebery's purchase-is edited with the same singular care, almost exhaustiveness, that Dr. Birkbeck Hill has before brought to bear on Boswell's Johnson. The Letters, over 80 in all, are treated in consonance with a notion of Hume's own that "every book should be as complete as possible and should never refer for anything material to other books". Libraries would assume a different aspect if the rule were universally followed; but it is very well that it has been observed in the present case. The amount of illustrative matter, as interesting as it is pertinent, presented with the Letters, renders the volume the first indispensable supplement to our knowledge of the great sceptic that has appeared since Burton's Life and Correspondence of D. H. in 1846. It is the man or the man-of-</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 287 letters, far more than the philosopher, upon whom additional light is thrown; for the philosophical works, except the Dialogues on Natural Religion, had all appeared before Hume came into relation with the worthy and intelligent Strahan. We get, however, most curious indica- tions of his unremitting anxiety, till within a few days of his death, to make as perfect as possible the general collection of Essays with which from 1757 he incorporated his two philosophical Enquiries (that super- seded for himself all that he had done in his youthful T-eatise). Other- wise the Letters disclose a good deal that is new about the posthumous publication of the Dialogques on Natural Religion. Dr. Hill, by subjoining various letters from Adam Smith and others (some of them not before published), can hardly have left anything to be added to the story of Hume's dying concern for that work of his maturest powers. While there is so much to thank the editor for, one muist note in him a curious disposition to insinuate things to Hume's disadvantage, and, in parti- cular, to magnify the import of the sweet-tempered philosopher's solitary lapse from perfect equanimity (away from the ground of politics or national feeling) throughout a correspondence of twenty years. Life of John Stuart Mill. By W. L. COURTNEY. (" Great Writers.") London: Walter Scott, 1889. Pp. 194, xii. This short Life adds nothing to what was already known of Mill, but is conceived on the whole in a notably appreciative spirit. It ought to have the effect of 'sending the reader back to Prof. Bain's John Stuart Mill (1882), which, with the same author's James Mill, supplies to Mr. Court- ney most of the personal facts that he knows outside of Mill's Autobio- graphy. He makes, however, effective use besides of the interesting par- ticulars regarding Mill to be found in Caroline Fox's Journals and Letters, and extracts are given from a striking judgment by Mr. Gladstone (written for this Life) on Mill's parliamentary career. Where Mr. Court- ney, who has before occupied himself with Mill's philosophy (see MIND iv. 421), chiefly fails is in familiarity with its sources. For example, if he is one of " those who have read Hartley's Observations on lMan " (p. 21), he must have a little forgotten it, when remarking on James Mill's Analysis in comparison with it; and, at page 77, there is the old want of discrimi- nation, when Mill appears to be connected as much with Hume as with Hartley. One other point may be noticed. Mr. Courtney does not omit to mention, after Prof. Bain, the article on Whately's Logic in the West- minister Review of 1828, but seems not to know it at first hand. It gives more evidence of advance towards Mill's well-known positions of fifteen years later than appears in Prof. Bain's references to it, and it has always seemed strange to the present writer that it is wholly passed over by Mill himself in the Autobiography when he marks the stages in the develop- ment of his logical views. If ever a selection of Mill's earlier papers, excluded from the Dissertations and Discussions, is made and published, it should especially include this Whately article. On Truth: A Systematic Inquiry by ST. GEORGE MIVART, Ph.D., M.D., F.R.S. London:, Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co., 1889. Pp. x., 580. "This work is a futidamental scientific inquiry, written in plain language, concerning the grounds of all assent, and the relations which subsist between the world and the human mind. It also contains a review of conceptions deemed by the author probable or evidently true respect- ing the essential natures of the various existences revealed to us by the senses and the intellect. It is an inquiry which necessarily touches upon many popuilar and scientific beliefs, and it lays down a foundation, based</page><page sequence="3">288 NEW BOOKS. upon natural science alone, for the systematic regulation of conduct." Its five sections are entitled-Fundamental Facts and Principles, Idealism, Man, The World, Science. Critical Notice will ^ low. The Philosophy of Mysticismz. By CAARL DU PREL, Dr. Phil. Translated from the German by C. C. MASSEY. 2 vols. London: George Redway, 1889. Pp. xxviii., 332, 316. This is a carefully executed and well annotated translation of a remarkable attempt to give. "mysticism" an experimental basis. The facts to which the author appeals are those of dream and of " somnam- bulism "-under which term is included " artificial somnambulism," or hypnotism. Of two classes of these facts he gives especially full accounts-which have an interest independent of the theories founded on them--in vol. i., ch. 5 (" Dream a Physician," pp. 191-332), and vol. ii., ch. 1 (" The Faculty of Memory," pp. 1-115). He has collected heie -(1) cases of direct knowledge by " sonmambulists " of the processes of organic life in themselves or others, and examples of their power over these processes, either direct by " natural sanative " action or indirect by the prescription of appropriate remedies revealed in dream; (2) cases of exalted memory in dream and allied states, and of " alternating con- sciousness ". The conclusion he draws from the reports accumulated is that in somnambbulism and deep sleep the " threshold of sensibility " is displaced; those vegetative processes, for example, that are "uncon- scious " in waking life becoming conscious in the state of dream. The dreams of "deepened or exalted sleep" have not the irrational and incoherent character of ordinary dreams. " All the irrational part" of dreams " derives from the participation of the organ which is active in waking life, while all the rational is due to the freedom of the dream- organ from disturbance ". Observation of somnambulists shows that there is present to them in dream the memory of their waking life, although, as a rule, they do not remember their dream-life on waking. The dream-life, then, is " higher " than the waking life, since it goes beyond it and includes it. And this is so not merely in the case of somnambulists, but generally. Somnambulists only differ from other persons in manifesting with exceptional evidence what exists in all cases. The heightened memory in dream, for example, is a fact that all may verify who ever chance to remember their " deep" dreams. The explanation of the facts, according to th-e author, can only be found in a doctrine of dual personality. Man is to be regarded as a single " sub- ject" including two different "persons," the higher person of exalted sleep and of the mystical states generally, and the lower person of waking life. The limited circle of consciousness of the person of waking life is divided by the "psycho-physical threshold" from the life that we call " unconscious " but that is unconscious neither for the " person " of dream nor at any time for the real " subject ". Organic processes for "the transcendental Ego lying beneath the psycho - physical threshold " are all in the full light of consciousness. In the " mystical" modes of consciousness-all of which are in essence " somnambulic "- there are to be seen "-' germinal indications and psychical beginnings" prophetic of new powers that man will acquire in the course of bio- logical evolution. That there are such indications we are led to expeat by "Darwinism". The. new powers, however, are powers that the same individual will have the use of in the future, not simply, as in the ordinary " Darwinian " view, powers to be acquired for the benefit of " the race ". The present life has been taken on by " the transcendental Ego" in order to acquire experience that is preserved in memory for</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 289 some future mode of personal existence. The author leaves it some- what doubtful what- are the physiological relations of "the transcen- dental Ego ". On the one hand, he identifies " the transcendental Sub- ject " with "the organising principle in us," and many of the facts suggest to him that, " as waking consciousness proceeds parallel with corresponding changes of the senses and brain, so the transcendental- psychological functions seem to be parallel with corresponding changes in the ganglionic system ". On the other hand, he places the same subject at the ground of those " mystical" states in which the life of the senses is suppressed; and, as the translator points out, his general theory requires that the subject should be only partially " immersed " in the physical organism. He has evidently not fully decided in his own mind whether any well-authenticated facts necessitate the assump- tion of a consciousness without physiological correlate, or whether this assumption is absolutely required by his theory. If he is arguing, as he claims to be, on the ground of a " monistic doctrine of the soul," then there is need of more proof than he gives that -the most characteristic cases of "ecstasy " on the one hand, and of the "natural sanative power" of the organism in the hypnotic state on the other, can have precisely the same physiological explanation. Another point on which the translator makes some acute remarks is the author's attempt to find Kantian support for his mysticism. To an argument from the Kantian point of view, the translator-who occupies generally the position of a disciple--objects that the distinction between two worlds of subjeQtive experience, even though one of them be called "mystical," cannot be identified with Kant's distinction between the phenomenon and the thing-in-itself. While only seeking confirmation and not proof of his doctrine in the Kantian philosophy, the author lays some stress on coincidences of parts of his own system with Kant's " intuitive" antici- pations of " modern mysticism," and has edited the psychological section of the little-known Vorlesungen iiber Metaphysik (see below, p. 300) with a view to the support of his positions. Social Progress. An Essay by DANIEL GREENLEAF THOMPSON, Author of A System of Psychology, The Problem of Evil, The Religious Sentiments of the Human Mind, &amp;c. Londoni: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1889. Pp. xix., 161. The aulthor continues the series of his works noticed in MIND (for the last, see vol. xiii. 285) by an essay on " Social Progress ". The result of the essay is very well given in the following passage: " Social Progress is only made in the direction of obtaining the most perfect liberty. The most complete individual happiness is the ultimate desideratum; but this can in, no way be secured but through the perfection of Social Liberty. The latter is even necessary for the perfection of individual freedom. To realise such ideals of liberty there must be law, because only through law can there be security. Nor can security be perfect except there be equality of rights. These, in turn, cannot be main- tained if there be great inequality of power. And, in fine, none of these conditions can be completely developed save through the universal prevalence in humanity of that disposition and character by which one finds his happiness and welfare in .the happiness and welfare of his fellow-men." In his preface Mr. Thompson gives an interesting account of the development of his thought and of the " plan of life " which he long since formed, and which he has been able to combine with a legal career. It will not be without interest to students generally, he rightly thinks, " to note that it is possible for a man who during alU the 19</page><page sequence="5">290 NEW BOOKS. period has been also devoted to the study and practice of an exacting profession to carry out for twenty years a systematic plan of philo- sophical study, writing and publication ". The First Principles of Knowledge. By JOHN RICKABY, S.J. (" Manuals of Catholic Philosophy.") London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1888. Pp. xii., 412. Another volume of the "Manuals of Catholic Philosophy" follows the ethical volume mentioned in the last number of MIND. The author, after a reference to Mill and Prof. Bain on the necessity of a " material logic," proceeds to the following explanation of the purpose of the present manual: "Little as the modern representatives of the School- men are satisfied, either with the spirit of Mr. Mill's demand, or with the mode of his own response to it, they have deemed it well worth while, not indeed to change the old Logic, but to add to it a new book. The newly-added part of Logic, often called Material, Applied or Critical, takes for its special purpose to defend the objective reality of thought. It is thus an assertion of a form of realism, as against idealism, and is called in this book the "Philosophy of Certitude". For the whole question comes to this: What reasonable account can be given of man's claim to have real certainty about things ? What are the ultimate grounds for holding that man may regard his knowledge about objects as tndoubtedly correct? Scientifically to draw out the account here demanded is a work appositely described by the title, The First Prin- ciples of Knowledge." In Part i. (" The Nature of Certitude in general," pp. 1-247), the Scholastic definition of "truth of intellect" as "the conformity of thought to thing" is defended against the modern doc- trines opposed to it. Part ii. ("Special Treatment of Certitude," pp. 249-396) discusses successively the questions of "The Trustworthiness of the Senses," "Objectivity of Ideas, whether singular or universal," "Exaggerated Realism, Nominalism and Conceptualism," "Conscious- ness," "Memory," "Belief in Human Testimony," "Belief in Divine Testimony ". Having in the body of the work contrasted the illogical character and want of system of modern philosophies with the logical and systematic completeness of Scholasticism, the author in his last chapter balances his assertion of "the prerogatives of reason," which have so far been "put higher than this sceptical age is inclined to allow," by an assertion of the superior claims of " supernatural faith," to the production of which " reason alone is inadequate ". Logic. By RICHARD F. CLARKE, S.J. (" Manuals of Catholic Philosophy.") London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1889. Pp. xix., 497. Deductive Logic. By ST. GEORGE STOCK, M.A., Pembroke College, Oxford. London: Longmaans, Green &amp; Co., 1888. Pp. xi., 356. These two students' manuals-:of interest from their different points of view-are reserved for comparative Critical Notice; as in the present No. (p. 271, above) Father Rickaby's Moral Philosophy has been set beside the American man-aal of President E. G. Robinson. Father Clarke is editor of the whole " Stonyhurst Series " of Catholic manuals, which is to include a Natural Theology, a Psychology and a General Metaphysics, beyond the three volumes already published. Father Rickaby's First Principles of Knowledge (see previous note) will not be overlooked in con- nexion with his colleague's Logic.</page><page sequence="6">NEW :BOOKS. 291 Darwinigm and Politics. By DAVID G. RITCHIE, M.A., Fellow and Tutor of Jesus College, Oxford. London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1889. Pp. 101. "There can be no doubt," the author says, " that the formule of Evolution do supply an apparent justification to the defenders of un- restricted laissezfaire and to the champions, more or less consistent and thorough-going, of existing inequalities of race, class and sex, and a plausible weapon of attack against those who look to sonmething better than slavery or competition as the basis of human society." He accord- ingly criticises the formule in question-namely, "heredity" and "the survival of the fittest "-with a view to showing that, properly under- stood, they do not condemn the pursuit of a social ideal differing from that of "the aristocratic Conservative " or of " the laissez faire Radical ". His contentions, reduced to their simplest form, are (1) that the struggle for existence is not simply a physical struggle, but, in human society, is also a struggle among ideas; (2) that for the human race the influence of social institutions and of education must be taken account of over and above the influence of physical heredity. This last especially is of course an important truth to insist on against anyone who should maintain that the formulae of " survival of the fittest " and " heredity" are, either sepa- rately or together, perfectly adequate to the explanation and regulation of all social activities; but it must be said that Mr. Ritchie's applications of it to the criticism of scientific ideas are not always successful. A good deal of the argument on the subject of heredity for example (pp. 51-69) seems to be irrelevant whatever conclusion we are expected to draw. Having first tried to minimise the importance of heredity by citing the opinions of naturalists who disbelieve in the transmission of acquired characters, the author quotes from Mr. Galton a passage to the effect that " there is a definite limit to the muscular [and intellectual] power of every man, which he cannot by any education or exertion overpass " (pp. 61-2), and goes on to say, " If this is the dictum of science, it might seem for a moment to deal a fatal blow to the aspirations of democracy ". He then proceeds to argue that under existing social conditions there are obstacles not recognised by Mr. Galton to the free unfolding of innate powers. Now if this argument is directed against Mr. Galton's position as to the inequality of inherited aptitudes, it in no way touches it. If on the other hand it is only directed against the " too contented acquiescence in existing social arrangements " to which " Mr. Galton seems to lend countenance," what is the point of the previous argument that " the doctrine of heredity " may be nothing more than " the survival of a very ancient superstition"? (p. 51). The force of Mr. Ritchie's criticisms is in some places difficult to see because of the uncertainty in which he leaves us as to the precise nature of his social ideal. There seems, for ex- ample, a notable inconsistency between pages 85-7 and 88-9. First it is implied that in politics, but not in the family, " the patriarchal stage of social evolution" is already transcended. Then, at p. 89, it is said- " The family ideal of the State may be difficult of attainment, but, as an ideal, it is better than the policeman theory. It would mean the moralisation of politics." The Elements of Mental and Moral Science as applied to Teachinq. By W. C. COUPLAND, M.A., D.Sc., Author of The Spirit of Goethe's Faust, Translator of Hartmann's Philosophie des Unbewussten. London: Joseph Hughes, 1889. Pp. 103. "The design of this booklet," the author says, "is to familiarise teachers with the idea of the close relationship subsisting between</page><page sequence="7">292 NEW BOOKS. Science of Mind in general and Science of Education in particular. In so brief a treatment there is no pretence, of course, of surveying the entire field; in fact, I have merely written a short essay, calling atten- tion, in my own way, to certain aspects of the subject, in the hope of leading some with elevated conceptions of the scholastic profession to engage in a thorough study of the Science and Philosophy of Education." Points to be noted in the author's treatment are his division of minds into the " subjective," " sensuous " and " objective " types (p. 33), and, on the practical side, his views that "the last stage of the educational process consists in the calling into play one supreme motive, pleasure in the exercise of original power," and that "it is by the discipline of the natural consequences of action that the true conscience is formed ". Corona: The Bright Side of the Universe. Studies in Optimism. By F. T. MOTT, F.R.G.S. London: Williams &amp; Norgate; Leicester: J. and T. Spencer, 1888. Pp. vii., 190. A rhapsodical development, partly in prose and partly in verse, of a theory called "the force-wave theory," which, "without denying the reality of matter, makes the existence of mind independent of it and superior to it, and opens up a scientific possibility of a future life ". Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. Part xiii. London: Trtibner &amp; Co., 1888. Pp. 271-397. Besides an address from the president, Prof. H. Sidgwick, and two other short papers-"Connexion of Hypnotism with the Subjective Phenomena of Spiritualism " (anonymous), "Experiments in Thought- transference," by M. Dessoir-this Part contains a very careful and candid examination by Mrs. H. Sidgwick (pp. 288-354) of the "Evidence for Premonitions " which the Society has so far obtained. Her conclu- sion is that, though she thinks " no one will deny that some at least of the dreams are, as reported, if not premonitory, at least very remarkable coincidences,"-yet, all things considered, she does not think "the possi- bility of supernormal prevision should be accepted even as 'a working hypothesis' by the scientific world," as she herself considers "telepathy ought to be accepted ". In a "Supplement," which will henceforth consist of " papers not strictly included within the transactions of the Society," Mr. F. W. H. Myers gives a reasoned account of what he calls "Experiments on Strata of Personality" by Profs. Pierre Janet and J. Liegeois, also a brilliant and incisive estimate of " The Work of Edmund Gurney in Experimental Psychology ". The writer of the obituary notice of the lamented Gurney in MIND No. 52 seizes this occasion to say that, soon after writing, he became satisfied that it was a mistake to suppose that Gurney's strength had been broken down by the ardour of his Psychical Research work. A Brief History of Greek Philosophy. By B. C. BURT, M.A., formerly Fellow, and Fellow by Courtesy, m the Johns Hopkins University. Boston: Ginn &amp; Co., 1889. Pp. xiv., 296. "Most of the works treating of the subject of which this volume treats axe learned and extensive, overwhelming the general reader, and even the student, almost, with a sense of the superabundant wealth of the ancient thought in particular, and the world's thought in general. It is hoped that the present work will render accessible in convenient form and quantities some of the noblest portions of the intellectual wealth of Greece. An attempt is here made not merely to expound and elucidate,</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 5293 but also to present in theirhistorical connexion, and give a just estimate of the validity of, the leading standpoints and categories of Greek thinking. Much reading and not a little original study have been given to the task." The history' seems to be careful and accurate; but the author's references, both in the bibliographical list given at the beginning "For the convenience of the student," and throughout, are exclusively to English books' and translations. L'Jicriture et le Caractere. Par J. CRuIPIEUX-JAMIN. Precede d'une Preface de M. le Dr. PAUL HELOT. Avec 146 figures dans le texte. Paris: F. Alcan, 1888. Pp. 313. The principle of M. Crepieux-Jamin's work is " the identification of handwriting with mimetics ". Handwriting is to be regarded as " com- posed of a number of little gestures ". Since the gestures of writing, like those of expression generally, are physiological movements, proportioned, as regards exte#t, constancy and energy, to corresponding " psychological movements, they may become the ground for inferences to character. "IPrenons pour exemple l'ecriture rapide. II nous repugne de penser qu'une serie de traits rapides puissent etre form6s habituellement par un esprit mou, une nature flegmatique. Nos mouvements sont des reponses A l'excitation cdr-4brale; s'ils sont forts, c'est que le moteur a de la puis- sance; s'ils sont vifs, c'est que le moteur est anime d'un mouvement rapide. Une ecriture rapide repond A une vive excitation nerveuse, elle doit 8tre rapportee A un etat psychologique comportant cette excitation: conception rapide, vivacite ou precipitation accidentelle." "Graphology," the author claims, is thus " based on physiology, demonstrated by the experimental ;nethod ". His results are curious and interesting, whether all of them can be held to be established by strict scientific method or not. The subject is treated under the principal heads of " general " and " special " signs (formation of particular letters, &amp;c.), and of resultants (inference of character from combinations of " signs "). Some pages are devoted to handwriting in disease (pp. 252-300) and to " the origins of graphology" (pp. 17-44), among the precursors of which Leibniz is rightly referred to. (The want of clearness the author complains of in the passage cited from Leibniziana at p. 24, it may be remarked, is due to a mistranslation.) Etudes de Science reelle. Par J. PUITSAGE. L'Instinct et l'Intelligence. De la Responsabilite. Discussion philosophique. Mons: H. Man- ceaux; Paris: F. Alean; Bruxelles: A. Manceaux, 1888. Pp. 360. Belief in anthropomorphic deities, on which social order rested in the past, having lost its power, and modern materialism being incompatible with the ideas of justice and responsibility, the only means of averting the anarchy that threatens modern society (based, as it is, on force and not on right) is a philosophical doctrine equally opposed to materialism and to " deism ". The chief positions of this doctrine, as set' forth by the author, are the impersonality of the moral order and the eternity of the soul. Human intelligence is the result of the union of the organism with an "iimmaterial' individuality ". From the "real sensibility " of man is to be distinguished animal " instinct," which is purely " a result of the organism". Responsibility implies freedom of the will. Man's free-will consists in his capability of choosing between " purely physio- logical impulses? and " obligations of the moral order"; and this depends on his possession of a principle of "real sensibility," immaterial, un- created and indestructible. "It may with certainty be affirmed that</page><page sequence="9">294 NEW BOOKS. future society will be established neither on the basis of materialism nor on that of an anthropomorphism of whatever kind: its bai-s will be real science, that which demonstrates scientifically the immateriality of the feeling of existence, the liberty of actions, the in?ontestability of right and of -eternal impersonal justice." Etudes sur Ic6 Raison. Par F&amp;LIx CELLARIER. Paris: F. Alcan, 1889. Pp. 279. These " Studies-" are preliminary to a more extensive work-; the author's final aim being " to constitute the definitive theory of know- ledge ". "If we have been fortunate in our efforts, we have obtained an immense result. for we possess henceforth, for knowledge, a larger and more unshakable basis than the minimurm quid inconcussumr of Descartes, his famous Cogito ergo sum. This basis is the absolute affirmation of absolute being by the ego; we do not add: and consequently the existence of that being, for that would be a pure tautology." From the affirmation of absolute beingtflow certain "rational ideas," divided into-Ideas repre- senting realities (Ideas of (1) being, (2) substance, (3) cause); Ideas representing attributes (Ideas of (1) infinite, (2)- unity, identity, im- mutability, (3) good, true, beautiful); Ideas representing relations (Ideas of (1) time, (2) space). Against Kant the author concludes that " all judgments a priori are analytical, ahd give us knowledge that we draw really from the rational ideas in which, though in an obscure manner, they are contained ". The difference of this conclusion from Kant's he explains by the difference of his point of departure. " Kant does not admit that we know the infinite as we know the finite; for our part, on the contrary, we believe that we attain absolute being, as we attain relative being, by a concrete knowledge." To found thetknowledge of the absolute on a concrete fact of knowledge presents the difficulty that this fact must imply "' an infinite intelligence ". " But can an infinite intelligence be found in a finite being ?" To this the author replies by a distinction between "essence" and "existence ". The essence of finite existences is infinite. Since the infinite is necessarily one, there is only one essence, although there are "many diverse existences ". Consequently, there is only one single reason, " absolute, immutable, infinite, since reason is an attribute of the essence, and not of the existence, which does but manifest it ". Essai sur la Mehthode en Me'taphysique. Par PAUL DUBUc, Ancien 4leve de l'Ecole normale supdrieure, Agrege de philosophie, Docteur es- lettres. Paris: F. Alcan, 1887. Pp. 310. The author divides the problem of metaphysics into -the three- tradi- tional ones of " cosmology," " rational psychology7 andi-- " rtianal theology," and each of these again into the questions of " existence " and of " essence ". He sets himself to show, against those members of the "positive," "psychological" and "critical" schools who deny the possibility of a metaphysics distinct from science, that these problems all necessarily present themselves, that they cannot be perfectly solved by scientific methods, and that, with the aid of a philosophical method on which henceforth agreement ought to be possible, they may all be solved in the sense of " spiritualigm ". First, agailnst those who (with Comte) admit no philosophy beyond a synthesis of the objective sciences, he shows that science points beyond itself to the question of the exist- ence of real material objects, and that for the solution of, this neither the experimental nqor the mathematical method will suffice. Next he proceeds to the consideration of "the subjective met4od," of psycho-</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 295 logists. This, he concludes, is sufficient by itself to solve the questions of the existence. and essence of the soul.- The testimony of conscious- ness both proves infallibly the existence of a soul that is essentially active, and enables us to assign to it the attributes of causality, sub- stantiality, finality, upiity, identity and liberty. The subjective method, however, leaves unsolved the cosmological and theological problems. The theological problem, or the question of the absolute, is to be solved by the " critical " method, which, although hitherto used chiefly for the destruction of metaphysics, can found as well as destroy. For a positive solution of the question of the absolute in accordance with " critical" method, the author finds hints in Mr. Spencer's position maintained against Hamilton. The same method; he proceeds to argue, justifies us in defining the essence of the absolute in terms of personality, though it is to be admitted that the definition can never be adequate. Philosophy is able to decide positively the question of the existence of the world by the consideration that matter is "impenetrable " for spirit; but it has to leave the question of the " essence " of objects to science. Objective science can determine the phenomenal but not the inner nature of matter; and this remains finally inaccessible to all methods. In the end, therefore, metaphysics, " first philosophy" or "the science of being " retains " rational psychology " and " rational theology " wholly for itself, investigating the former by the " subjective" and the latter by a speculative development of the "critical" method, while it leaves cos- mology-except so far as the mere existence of the world is concerned -to the experimental and mathematical sciences. La Morale d'Aristote. Par Mme. JULES FAVRE (nde VELTEN). Paris: F. Alcan, 1889. Pp. 388. A selection of translated extracts from Aristotle, with introductory expositions, on the same plan as La Morale des Stofciens and La Morale de Socrate (see MIND xiii. 136, 616). The main divisions under which the extracts are arranged are-Part i., "Virtue"; Part ii., "The indi- vidual and social Virtues " ; Part iii., " The Affections Part iv., c. i. "God," c. ii. " The Soul," c. iii. " Education ". La Morale, I'Art et la Religion d'apre's Guyau. Par ALFRED FOUILL9E. Avec portrait de Guyau. Paris: Alcan, 1889. Pp. 200. "The future of morals, of art, of religion,-three of the greatest pre- occupations of our time,-such is the object of this volume. Starting from the ideas of a philosopher, too early dead, who excited universal sympathies in England as in France, the author rises to considerations of perfectly general reach. The dominant idea which Guyau developed in a series of important works is the expansion of life as common principle di art, of morals and of religion. According to Guyau,--and this is the generating conception of his whole system,--life, well under- stood, involves in its very intensity a principle of natural expansion, of fecundity, of generosity, which morals, art and metaphysics manifest under three diverse forms. In the first part of his book M. Fouillee examines this idea in its application to art, where it appears to him a necessary corrective of the Spencerian theory that makes of art a kind of play. To bring out this, he examines the Vers d'utn Philosophe, in which Guyau himself applied his e-sthetic doctrines to poetry. The second part sets in relief th e new elements brought by Guyau to the ethics of evolution, as'well as the principal objections he himself made against contemporary English moralists. The third Part has reference to the -futtire of religion and of metaphysics, which again, for Guyau,</page><page sequence="11">296 NEW BOOKS. attach themselves to the very sources of life, because they constitute the adaptation of the individual to the universal life, to universal or cosmical society." Critical Notice will follow. E. CARO, de l'Academie Fran9aise. Philosophie et Philosophs. Paris: Hachette, 1888. Pp. 423. Of these collected papers by M. Caro, written at various times within the last twenty years or more, only the first (" Comment les Dogmes finissent et comment ils renaissent," pp. 1-60) treats directly of " Philo- sophy " apart from " Philosophers ". The rest of the book consists of essays on the life and work of Theodore Jouffroy and Frdddric Ozanam; a study of "Mme. Swetchine: son r6le et son influence dans la soci6td fran9aise "; and reviews of works by Cousin, Simon, Ravaisson, Gratry, Jourdain, Saisse^t and Wallon. The essays are representative work of an independent member of the Spiritualist school. MAURICE DE LA SIZERANNE. Les Aveugles par un Aveugle. Avec une Preface de M. le Comte d'HAuSSONVILLE, de l'Academie Fran9aise. Paris: Hachette, 1889. Pp. xviii., 176. This interestingly written little book is by an author who, having lost his sight (nearly twenty years sinice) at the age of nine, has come to occupy himself specially with the education and technical instruction of the blind, and with the diffusion among the general public of an interest in their lot. The parts into which M. de la Sizeranne's book is divided are--(1) Psychology of the Blind, (2) Valentin Haiuy and his Work, (3) Schools of the Blind, (4) The Blind in Society. The psychology is to a greater extent drawn from observation than from introspection; it being the author's aim to impress on his readers that there is no general jntellectual and moral psychology of the blind, who differ from one another in as many ways as those who see; but from observation he is able to point out some characteristics depending on the special acuteness acquired by the senses of hearing, touch and smell. With the develop- ment of the sense of hearing he would associate the special feeling for music and poetry often found in the blind. He himself-the son of a painter, and brought up in his father's studio-has always retained a specially strong interest in pictorial imagery (pp. 32-3). Le Sens de la Vie. Par EDOUARD ROD. Paris: Perrin, 1889. Pp. 313. This is a very readable philosophical romance, which may perhaps best be described as a study of the ideal sceptic (tinged with pessimism), who arrives at no fixed intellectual belief of any kind, but who lives exactly as other people do. In four Books, entitled " Marriage," "Paternity," " Altruism,' " Religion," the experiences of the hero's life, with the emotions and reflections they arouse, are described in imaginary autobiographic form. He has incipient tendencies to various modern enthusiasms, but can give himself up wholly to none of them; finds that by an act of will it would be quite possible to acquire a religious faith, but that he does not after all desire to have one; and as the end of his reflections thinks of constructing a philosophical system to be entitled "JIllusionism," with " Dilettantism" for its practical outcome, but con- chides that it is better to leave it unwritten; in the meantime finding enduring satisfaction only in the domestic affections, yet never quite content to become absorbed in these.</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS,. 297 ,Sur la Composition des Sensations et la Formation de la Notion d'Espace. Par L. DE LA RIVE. Gen6ve: H. Georg, 1888. Pp. 99. An attempt at a mathematical theory of the formation of " the notion of' space ". In the author's view, " a notion of space might result from the exercise of any one of the senses ". " The tactile and visual sensa- tions, however, have a dominant importance in the psychological opera- tion in question, because the exercise of those two senses is accompanied by voluntary movements of a precise kind." For the foundation of the mathematico - psychological theory proposed, colour is taken as "a variable and continuous quantity"; " three variables of coloured sensa- tion" are assumed, viz., (1) tone of saturated colour, (2) degree of saturation, (3) intensity; Young's theory of the three elements of "specific colour" is adopted. "Consciousness of voluntary movement" is resolved into three elements (p. 54), and its mathematical theory worked out separately. Having developed mathematica4l theories of the " composition " of sensations of colour and sensations of " motor-effort," the author goes on to "the notion of spherical space" and to the separate study of " monocular visual space " (pp. 76-89) and of " tactile space" (pp. 89-99). The latter, he finds, " possesses all the elements of extension. Whilst monocular visual space localises the luminous sources along the directions of angular space without assigning to them a distance from the centre, tactile space localises the causes of contact, along the variable directions from a centre, and by the superposition of a second muscular activity, according to variable distances from this centre." Prof. GIOVANNI CESCA. La Religione della Filosofia scientiftca. Padova: Drucker e Senigaglia, 1889. Pp. 42. Scientific philosophy, while excluding every form of theology, does not ;exclude religion; for religion contains, besides theology, another element, "the moral ideal," which has gone on increasing in importance as theology has declined. The future religion of scientific philosophy will be " the moral religion of humanity ". Le Degenerazioni umane. Di GIUSEPPE SERGI. Milano: Fratelli Dumo- lard, 1889. Pp. 228. The author, having in his earlier chapters studied, on scientific lines, the various forms of " human degeneration "-such as insanity, crimini- nality and the various forms of "parasitism "-discusses in his last chapter the means of social "regeneration ". These he finds to be chiefly two-education, especially of the character, and repression. " The protection of the weak" is to be carried out by society within certain limits determined by its effect on the community as a whole. There is no objection to hygienic measures, for example, or to provision against accidents. On the other hand, those forms of " sentimental altruism " that augment the numbers of the degenerate are to be avoided, and there should be no question at all as to " the protection of the bad ". " It is not the bad that we must protect but the good, that which is sound; the bad we must resolutely eliminate." Mf. ANGELO VACCARO. Geitesi e Funzione delle Leggi Penali. Ricerche Sociologiche. Roma: Fratelli Bocca, 1889. Pp. 238. The author criticises at great length the doctrines 'of the new Italian school of Criminologists as to the origin and nature of crime, and attacks their theory of punishment. His own opinion is that the criminals that are anthropologically " degenerate," having been created by the injustice of society, ought to be treated with special tenderness.</page><page sequence="13">298 NEW BOOKS.

Thinking that what Sociology most needs at present is criticism, the author here examines -impartially and with very extensive knowledge of the literature of the subject-its assumptions, its results, and its position in relation to the other sciences. Sociology, he finds, although in a rudimentary or rather tentative stage, still exists as a definite branch of scientific inquiry. No one group of phenomena, however, has been shown to be the determining factor of social movement. Not even Comte's view that assigns predominance to intellectual factors can be accepted, though it has a far higher degree of probability than the doctrine that gives economical organisation the determining influence. Sociology must; be distinguished from the practical sciences-ethics, politics, &amp;c. Among the theoretical sciences it is "autonomous and distinct," alike from biology and psychology; the "differential cha- racter" of human social life being the special kind of continuity de- scribed under the name of "history ". On this depends the practical function of sociology. The law of social evolution, once definitely known, will become a guide to action by making clear how and within what limits the ideal of society can be realised. Der Ursprung der Sittlichkeit. Von HUGO MtdNSTERBERG. Freiburg i. B.: J. C. B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1889. Pp. 120. The answer which the writer-following Prof. WJundt-gives to the question of "the origin of morality" is that morality is developed out of "4 customs." which imply commands of society to the individual. The office of the "moral reformer " is to bring out the relative importance of social commands; in other words, to make explicit the relations they already bear to one another implicitly in the consciousness of the society in which he lives. In the struggle for existence those societies are selected for survival whose commands, as developed, are best adapted to the self-preservation of the community. The customs out of which morality arises are at first "morally indifferent". Morality appears when the individual obeys a command of the " collective will" simply because it is a command, aind in opposition to personal inclinations that would lead him to disobey it. When inclinations become perfectly adapted to ethical commands, morality, as a separate thing, disappears. Kant therefore rightly held that only actions done from the mere sense of duty have ethical value. But if an action done from inclination is "morally indifferent" (in this resembling the customs out of which morality arose), it is not therefore less praiseworthy than a "moral" action. For morality has its value-not, as Kant held, in itself, but-as a meains to " perfection," that is, to the attainment of an ideal of civilisa- tion towards which humanity is actually moving but which it will never reach; and it is only one means to this end. Its -function isa chiefly negative, being to suppress actions that prevent man from attaining perfection. Accordingly, "the immoral is in every case worse than the morally indifferent, but the moral is by no means always better than the morally indifferent". Positively--that is, for progress-good actions done out of inclination are of more value than good actions done simply out of regard for the moral law; and in the course of development, both "ontogenetic " and "phylogenetic " strictly moral actions are constantly passing into the class of morally indifferent actions, to the advantage of the race in its progress towards a fuller civilisation.</page><page sequence="14">NEW- BOOKS. 299 Logik.

This second edition of vol. i. of Prof. Sigwart's Logik (vol. ii. of which was reviewed, on the appearance of tlle first edition, by Mr. Venn in MIND iv. 426) is extended from the first by 65 pp. The author has sought to profit by the criticisms that have appeared in the fifteen years since the publication' of the first edition (1873), and by the -new work that has been done in the theory of logic, but, as before, has aimed at reducing references as much' as possible and at the avoidance of contro- versy on points of detail.

The present " Psychological Studies " are remarkable for the same combination of sound psychological knowledge with delicacy of original observation. The! first two-on " Character" and " Feeling" (Gemiuth) -treat of the -volitional and emotional types of mind; the first being regarded as distinctively masculine, the second as distinctively feminine. The rest treat of-'Sympathy" (in its forms of " Mitleid " and " Mit- freude"), "ZEsthetic Feeling," " Sleep and the nocturnal life of the Soul " (including hallucinations, hypnotic and other, as well as the phenomena of normal sleep), "Sensations in general," "Compulsory Colour-sensations " (Fechner's " Zwangsmassige Farbenempfindungen").

Stuttgart: J. G. Cotta, 1889. Pp. xiii., 608. The author here continues his history of modern ethics, of which the first volume, bringing the history down to the end of the 18th century, was reviewed in MIND viii. 295. In this second volume he deals with ethical philosophy in Germany (bk. i., pp. 3-290), France (bk. ii., pp. 292-394), and England (bk. iii., pp. 397-494) during the present century, beginning in the case of Germany with 'a chapter on Kant. The notes and references, which, as before, are brought to the end of the volume, extend over pp. 495-698. Critical Notice will follow. Lose Bldtter aGc&amp;u Kants N(litcase. Mitgetheilt. von RUDOLi 'REIcKE. Erstes Heft. Konigsberg: F. Beyer, 1889. Pp. 302. This first set of Loose Leaves from K&lt;ant's Re'mains has already appeared in the Altpreussische Monatsschrift (1887-88). Their provenacve is from two sources: that of the smaller number (pp. 1-59) from a purchase made by the K6nigsberg library at a bazaar at Dantzic in 1878, tlhat of the far larger amount from various collectiong (long before acquired by the same library), which about 1838 were more or less arranged by Schubert (joint editor of Kant's works) in thirteen bundles, with titles describing their contents. Omitting some letters, to be otherwise made public, the editor of these fragments, Dr. Reicke, now gives, carefully edited, from the Dantzic group, Kant's notes on topics such as reality,</page><page sequence="15">300 NEW BOOKS. happiness, analytical and synthetical propositions, and other points familiar to the readers of the two Kritiken (Pure. and Practical Reason). The papers from the more extensive collection (of which this present instalment gives only four out of the total thirteen bundles, viz., those numbered A to D) cover nearly the whole of Kant's literarv career. Those of A are mainly mathematical in content: they comprise some papers from the years 1755-63, as well as some from the period 1789-93. 'The three other bundles (of which D is the bulkiest) are chiefly in reference to the critical period 1783-96, though a few belong to an earlier date. Several of those from C belong to the preliminary sketches for published essays, e.g., the polemic against Eberhard and Schiller. The general drift of the contents of bundle D appears from the recur- ring heading, " Wider den. Idealism": they refer to the change of front, if not of doctrine, which Kant made between the first and second editions of his areat work. There are also fragments of an essay on optimism, probably as early as 1754. Besides the biographical interest of these notes, scattered on casual pieces of paper, backs of letters, and the like, they are obviously valuable indications in many cases of the points to which Kant attached special imlportanlce. IMMANUEL KANT'S Vorlesungem iiber Psychologie. Mit einer Einleitung: "Kant's mystische Weltanschauung ". Herausgegeben von Dr. CARL DU PREL. Leipzig: Ernst Guinthers Verlag, 1889. Pp. lxiv., 96. Dr. du Prel, as melntioned above, p. 289, edits these lectures on Psycho- logy-which form-1 part of Kant's VorlesuMige? iiber Mlletaphylsik, first pub- lished in 1821-with a view to confirming the mystical doctrine for which he believes that he has alreadv found an inductive basis. The psychology of the Vcrlesungen, he seeks to show, puts Kant's Trdume ein's Geisterselher s in a new light, giving this a turn decidedly favourable to mysticism. Kant's general philosophy, besides, leaves a place open for a mystical doctrine. "The thought of Kant that the perceptible world is olnly the phenomenon of a for us unknown thing-in-itself, that space and time are only forms of our knowledge, is eminently mystical, and so far one can certainly call Kant a mystic." This, it may be said, is to give the term a somewhat extended sense; but Dr. du Prel cer- tainly proves that Kant refused to deny dogmatically the possibility of the classes of phenomena-including ghosts--to which " modern mysti- cism "' appeals. "The earthly life"-thus the editor expresses his own mystical doctrine--" is only the dream of a transcendental subject"' (p. xlix.). Rather curiouisly, in his last two pages he insists on the danger of mnixing up the two kinds of experience, the " transcendental" and that of ordinary life. Since the " transcendental subject " has assumled a newv persolnality for the sake of the discipline that is to be gained by temliporary forgetfulness of the antenatal life, and by new mlodes of experience, mixture of antenatal memories with earthly life would frustrate the purpose it had in incarnating itself. Trhe mystical doctrine of the soul, therefore, while it has a high theoretical value and important ethical applications, is not to be allowed to pass into " practi- cal mysticism " (pp. lxiii.-lxiv.).

This treatise on ethics, with the outlines of a social and political philosophy, though called a system, is only such in the general sense of</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. .301 a connected and consistent discussion of the main topics of moral inquiry. A short indication of its contents may be given. After an introduction (pp. 1-17) explaining the author's view of the province and methods of ethics (midway between the field of absolute morality and the direction of individual conduct), Book i. (pp. 23-167) presents a summary but highly instructive sketch, first of the dominant ideas of the -,aim and essence of life, held respectively by the Greeks, the early Christians, and the modern civilised world; and secondly, of the main steps in the development of moral theory taken by the Greek, the medieval, and the modern systems. Book ii., following on this historical survey, discusses (pp. 171-366) questions of principle, the meaning of the cardinal ideas on which ethical argum'ent turns. Such are good and evil, the supreme good or chief end of man, duty and conscience, egoism and altruism, virtue and happiness, and free-will. It includes a special chapter (pp. 218-257) in examination of the arguments for the creed of Pessimism. The governing tendency of this part of the work is its effort to reconcile ideality of aim and tone with a sound realism founded on the critical treatment of experimental data. Book iii. (pp. 369-373), which gives an exposition of the aspects of the moral life, roughly classed under the heads of the individualistic and social virtues (and duties), is full of fine observation and wise suggestion for conduct. Beginning with those fundamental duties to self which, as self-control and reasonableness, constitute the elements of all higher morality, it sets forward what are the things needful to realise the best of life for a being with bodily wants (involving permanent economic means) no less than intellectual; and then deals with the sense of honour, adding a short chapter on the moral aspects of suicide. The social virtues give title to the discussion of benevolence, justice, charity and truthfulness-of which the last is especially full and interesting. Book iv. (pp. 577-861) is devoted to social and political problems. These are considered under the four forms of the common or collective life, viz., the family, social friendship, economical society, and the State. In the third of these divisions (treating of the structure of the social system and its economic bases) there is an ample and fair-minded examination (pp.,698-791) of Socialistic reform-theories and of the Socialist-democratic struggle in Germany. Critical Notice will follow. Naturforschuwng und Schule. Eine Zuriickweisung der Angriffe Preyers auf das Gymnasium vom Standpunkte der Entwicklungslehre. Von Dr. H. VAIHINGER, a. o. Professor der Philosophie an der Uni- versitat Halle. Koln u. Leipzig: Albert Ahn, 1889. Pp. xii., 54. "Superficial occupation with natural science," the author writes at the end of the preface to this reprinted Address (delivered originally before a scientific audience, and now enriched with very copious notes), " may lead to the imdervaluing of classical antiquity; but deeper penetration into nature leads, back to antiquity." His aim has been to show, by arguments based on the principles of physiological psychology and on the theory of evolution, that humanistic'culture such as is given in the classical Gymnasia must remain permanently the basis of higher educa- tion. He starts from the biological law of the parallelism of " phylo- geny " and " ontogeny ". According. to the view that regards biology as the foundation of psychology, this law,'he proceeds to argue, should be applicable to mind as well as to the physical organism. Its psycho- logical application is evidently this -that the development of the individual mind is a recapitulation of human history. This a priori extension of the law of the parallelism of' ontogenetic and phylogenetic</page><page sequence="17">302 NEW BOOKS. development is confirmed empirically by observation of individual minds. The pedagogical inference from it is that the individual can only be raised normally to the level that' humanity has now attained if his education is made to follow the stages of the education of the race, that is, the stages of historical development. Now the stages of the history of European civilisation are-(1) the Groeco-Roman world, (2) the "C Christian Teutonic " middle ages, (3) the modern world. In modern European education, therefore, the classical languages and literature should come first; then modern languages and the part of their literature that has its basis in the medieval world; while the characteristic product of the modern world, natural science, with its search for exact knowledge of causes, should be introduced last of all. The evo- lutionary law on which he bases his theory is to be received, according to the author, as in part a confirmation of the doctrine of those pedagogical writers who have held that education should follow the course indicated by nature, and in part as a means of giving-with the aid of the philo- sophy of history-a greater precision to that doctrine. In his appeal to the authorities, from Aristotle onwards, who have stated in some form the precept that the educator should "follow nature," he finds especially strong support among the scientific authorities. Prof. Huxley and Mr. Spencer, in particular, supply him with sentences which-taken along with his historical view-can be quoted with peculiar effectiveness (pp. 8-9). While contending for the permanence of the classical basis of education, Dr. Vaihinger does not propose to leave the Gymnasium exactly as it is, but suggests several reforms, such as greater attention to physical training and to English literature, the dropping of com- pulsory writing of Latin essays, and the introduction, in the later stages, of more mathematics and natural science. His arguments all deserve attentive study. Beitrage zu den Tlveorieen des Syllogismus und der Induktion. Von Dr. OTTO SEIFFERT. Breslau: Brehmer &amp; Minuth, 1888. Pp. 49. The author examines the theories of the syllogism and of induction put forth by Mill, Jevons, Sigwart, Erdmann, &amp;c., with a view to arriving at a theory of his own. In his theory of the syllogism he lays stress on its mediating function. This, he contends, rescues it from the charge of being a mere petitio principii (pp. 14-16). For " in the syllogism the validity of one, but only of one premiss, is conditioned by the validity of the conclusion" (p. 16). In his theory of induction he seeks to dis- tinguish, from the deductive element that is invariably a constituent of the inductive reasonings of developed thought (p. 38), a purely inductive element, the essential character of which is that every new particular case gives additional probability to the general conclusion (p. 44).

The general purpose of the work of which this is the first part is identical with that of the author's criticism of Du Bois-Reymond noticed in MIND xi. 138. The present volume is intended to bring about " a complete reconciliation," so far at least as ontology is concerned, " of knowledge with (religious, old Christian) faith, of reason with revelation, of philosophy with (genuine, true) theology -Die Welt- und Lebensanschauung Friedrich Ueberwegs in seinen gesam,melten p7ilosop1isc1-kritischen Abhcandlungen. Nebst einer biographisch. historischen Einleitung von Dr. MORITZ BRASCH. Leipzig: Gustav Engel, 1889. Pp. xlvi., 476.</page><page sequence="18">NEW, BOOKS. 803 Dr. Brasch has here collected Ueberweg's scattered philosophical writings, and has furnished them with an Introduction (pp. xi.-xlvi.- "Friedrich Ueberweg, his life, his writings and his philosophical im- portance ") in which the various influences under which he came, the, general nature of his final conclusions, and his attitude towards the controversies of the time, political, religious and philosophical, are very well described. The collection is full of interest and shows well the many-sidedness of Ueberweg's mind. The papers are brought under the heads of "Logic, Theory of Knowledge and Metaphysics" (pp. 1-260), " Mathematics, Philosophy of Nature and Psychology " (pp. 263- 349), and "Ethics" (pp. 353-438); two " Philosophical Addresses " being added in an appendix (pp. 441-476), -which treat respectively of the historical place of Jacobi in German philosophy, and of -the idea of destiny in Schiller. At the end of the first series is reprinted a "C Controversy on the principles of the Berkeleyan Phenomenalism " between Ueberweg on one side and the late Dr. Collyns Simon and two German champions of Berkeley on the other. This extends over pp. 87-260. There are several papers dealing more or less directly with Kant. Ueberweg shared the tendency of his day to return from the later German philosophies to the Kantian criticism of knowledge, but was not content to remain simply a Kantian. The critical philosophy he held to be not a settled result but a " stage of transition" to same new doctrine. The doctrine of "ideal-realism" by which he himself sought to mediate between the mechanical and the idealistic doctrines of later German philosophy shows signs of the influence exercised over him by Aristotle and Leibniz as well as by modern scientific ideas; its most noteworthy point being the view of nature as consisting in a continuous "' scale of beings " from mechanical forces up to man. Ueberweg's ethical papers aim at the fusion of Aristotelian with Kantian ethics. The first stage of this fusion he finds in the ethics of Herbart. Kant's " formal " and Aristotle's " material " principle are to be reconciled finally in a doctrine that places the ethical "form " in certain relations to one another of its "matter"-that is, of the " goods " that are ethical ends. The " goods " consist, as Aristotle taught, in certain human activities, and these may be arranged in a scale according to their rank. The formal principle of morality is that the highest of two ends-its accomplishment being supposed possible for the individual- is to be chosen. The morality of the individual, however, does not depend on the rank of the activity chosen, but on the disposition (Gesinnung) in choosing. All activities may be equal in moral rank if the disposition in choosing them is the same. It is this that Kant had in view in his doctrine of the categorical imperative. Spinozca's Entwicklungsqcang, besonders ncach seinen Briefen geschildert. Von Dr. phil. A. BALTZER. Kiel: Lipsius &amp; Tischer, 1888. Pp. 169. The author seeks to trace the development of Spinoza's thought by means of reference to his correspondence and to the circumstances of the time. It is on the point that there is a traceable development that he lays stress rather than on any important new conclusions in matters of detail which he believes he has arrived at. By means of the Letters he thinks it can be shown that numerous alterations suggested by the criticisms of friends were made in the Ethics, the final "redaction " of which probably dates from 1675. Again, in Spinoza's political doctrine he traces an influence of the circumstances and events of the time; the object here being to show that Spinoza was not absolutely a " solitary " thinker, but was in contact with political life. When, however, for this</page><page sequence="19">304 NEW BOOKS. he supposes that Spinoza may have come into personal contact with Hobbes, he not only has no evidence to produce, but goes straight in the teeth of well-known facts. And his other supposition that Spinoza replies to Leibniz (still at the journeyman stage), in propositions of bk. i. of the Ethics, is surely idle enough. Francis Bacon und seine geschichtliche Stellung. Ein analytischer Versuch von Dr. HANS HEUSSLER, O. Prof. der Philosophie an der Universitait Basel. Breslau: W. Koebner, 1889. Pp. 199. The author, having been led to acquire a very intimate knowledge of Bacon, has arrived at the conclusion that it is an error to represent him as in a special sense the founder of modern empirical philosophy; his view of things being in reality nmarked by a strongly rationalistic ten- dency. This he seeks to bring out by comparison with points in the doctrines of " the three great rationalists of the 17th century "- Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz (pp. 134-7). Points of contact are also found between Bacon and Kant (pp. 138-9). Bacon, the auithor of course allows, was not exclusively a rationalist; but if stress were. to be laid on resemblances with particular thinkers, then, he thinks, modern rationalism might just as easily be traced to Bacon's writings as modern empiricism. What he really did was to announ-ce eloquently the typical modern view of nature, and not the specially rationalistic or empiristic side of this view. The exposition-which touches upon most of the controverted points as to Bacon's life and character, moral and intel- lectual-is both fluently written and very copiously illustrated with notes and references (pp. 140-199), which show familiarity with the most recent literature.
