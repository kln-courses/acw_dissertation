<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Elizabeth Bloch-Smith: Judahite Burial Practices and Beliefs about the Dead (JSOT/ASOR Monograph Series 7), JSOT Press, Sheffield, 1992. 314 pages and nine tables, 32 line drawings. $70.00. This work, originally an Oriental Institute dissertation, examines some 850 burials, mostly in the Judaean highlands, with the purpose of using archaeological data to illuminate religious beliefs and practices that are only dimly reflected in the biblical texts. In this sense, E. Bloch-Smith's work is an important addition to the small, but growing, literature on Israelite-Judaean popular or folk religion. There have been other treatments of conceptions of death and afterlife in the Hebrew Bible, including several recent dissertations, but none, as the author rightly argues, that take full advantage of the archaeological evidence. Chapter 1 (pp. 25-62) develops a typology and pattern of distribution of Iron Age burial types. Basic types include: 1) simple; 2) cist; 3) jar burial; 4) anthropoid coffin; 5) bathtub coffin; 6) cave, chamber, or shaft; 7) arcosolia and bench; and 8) cremation. Bloch-Smith suggests that the population of Iron Age Palestine was by no means homogeneous and that the diversity and distribution of burial types reflects 'different cultural groups' (p. 55). For instance, cremation burials ? a Phoenician custom ? are found only along the coast, and (with one exception) only in the late eighth to early sixth centuries B.CE. Although previous studies have implied much more homogeneity in Iron Age tombs, Bloch-Smith's more detailed analysis seems convincing to me. If confirmed, it would be one of the best examples to date of the singular ability of archaeology to supplement and even correct the picture of ancient Israel yielded by texts of the Hebrew Bible alone. In Chapter 2 ('Burial Contents'; pp. 63-108), the author confirms what several scholars (including this reviewer) have long suggested: that burials, like many other aspects of Canaanite material culture, continue in the LB tradition until the end of the eleventh century B.CE. From the tenth century B.CE. on, newer styles of tombs produce a variety of artifacts, including food remains; typical Iron Age ceramic assemblages (no special pattern of types discernible); jewellery; stamp seals and scarabs; Eye-of-Horus, Bes and other faience amulets; toggle-pins, fibulae, rings, bangles, mirrors, combs, cosmetic palettes, and other items connected with personal adornment; gaming pieces; metal tools and implements of various kinds; terracotta models of furnishings; and both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines. Among the latter there are numerous examples of the so-called 'Astarte' or dea nutrix pillar-base figurines. Bloch-Smith develops a useful typology of several different categories, but concludes that all are basically connected in some way with the cult of the Mother Goddess in ancient Israel, predominantly Asherah. These female figurines with exaggerated breasts function to invoke 'sympathetic magical powers', not on behalf of the dead, but the living ? especially to guarantee the survival of infants (p. 98). Demographic considerations are also addressed in Chapter 2, but human skeletal remains are often too badly scattered or too poorly preserved (or carelessly excavated and published) to shed much light. Chapter 3 (pp. 109-132) surveys the pertinent biblical texts thoroughly and competently, examining terms designating the dead; descriptions of interment; visible markers of tombs; the presumed power of the dead; customs such as 'feeding the dead'; and prohibitions of cults of the dead. Bloch-Smith shows that until about the eighth century B.CE. there was indeed a considerable popular cult of the dead, which was later suppressed under prophetic and reform movements. 131</page><page sequence="2">132 REVIEWS The dead ? once considered 'el?h?m or 'divine ones' ? were then eclipsed. Rather than following B. Lang's notion of a 'Yahweh-alone' movement, Bloch-Smith argues for a far more complex historical and socio-economic explanation, involving particularly the centralization of power in the hands of the Jerusalem priesthood. However, one wonders to what extent the text describing the Josianic reform, for instance, is propaganda, rather than historical fact. Although Bloch-Smith does not draw this conclusion, it seems to this reviewer that here again it is later texts, especially the late redactions of the Dtr. and 'schools', that have tended to downplay or even edit out references to earlier Israelite-Judaean religious practices, with the result that many such passages now appear rather enigmatic. It should be pointed out that only archaeology (including, of course, any extra-biblical texts that it may produce) can possibly illuminate such passages. A symposium on monotheism in ancient Israel, which took place at Bern in January 1993, made it clear how the discoveries at Kh. el-Q?m and Kuntillet 'Ajr?d are revolutionizing our understanding of actual religions in ancient Israel. In Chapter 4 ('Summary and Con clusions'; pp. 133-151), the author contends that throughout the Iron Age, in both popular and official or State-sponsored religion, the cult of the dead, honouring quasi-divine ancestors, was a prominent feature, despite misgivings in a few prophetic or priestly circles. An exceedingly valuable appendix ('Catalogue of Iron Age Burials'; pp. 152-245) presents much of the raw data in condensed form. The illustrations consist of eight plates of line drawings (Figs. 1-14) and 18 distribution maps. There are very few weaknesses in Bloch Smith's study. One might wish that she had pursued some of the models forwarded in the socio-anthropological literature on mortuary practices that she cites briefly in her Introduction (pp. 15-23), because this would have given her work a wider audience. A clearer definition of the concept of popular religion, now growing in currency, would have been helpful; and she too modestly refrains from making her own significant contribution here more explicit. Finally, I would have welcomed her observations on whether the cult of the dead appealed largely to women, as C. Meyers and P. Bird have argued cogently that many aspects of popular religion in ancient Israel did. These comments notwithstanding, it is clear that ?. Bloch-Smith's work is a landmark study. It is not only an exhaustive and authoritative analysis of the archaeological data by an archaeologist, but also a competent, judicious and balanced synthesis with all the relevant biblical data. A few additional recent works on popular religion are noteworthy: S.B. Ackerman: Under Every Green Tree, Popular Religion in Sixth-Century Judah (Atlanta, G A, 1992); R. Albertz: Religionsgeschichte Israels in alttestamentlicher Zeit (G?ttingen, 1992); O. Keel and C. Uehlinger: G?ttinnen, G?tter und Gottessymbole, Neue Ertkentnisse zur Aufgrund bislang unterschlossener ikonographischer Quellen (Freiburg, 1992). William G. Dever</page></plain_text>
