INTRODUCTION In taking up and elaborating upon John Wansbrough's insistence that emergent Islam be seen as a continuation of the Near Eastern Semitic monotheistic tradition, 1 Gerald R. Hawting makes an important observation: That Islam is indeed related to Judaism and Christianity as part of the Middle Eastern, Abra- hamic or Semitic tradition of monotheism seems so obvious and is so often said that it might be wondered why it was thought necessary to repeat it. The reason is that although it is often said, acceptance of Islam as a representative of the monotheist religious tradition is not always accom- panied by willingness to think through the implications of the statement (emphasis added).2 Although both Muslim tradition and Western scholarship articulate a recognition of Islam's place within the Semitic monotheistic tradition, there is not only often an unwillingness to embrace the implications of this recognition, there is also in practice the tendency to distance Islam from that tradition.3 This is particularly the case regarding the Islamic Gotteslehre. Islam is often viewed as the religion par excellence of divine transcendence.4 God is khilãf al-'alam - "the absolute divergence from the world" - and this characteristically Islamic doctrine of mukhãlafa, "(divine) otherness," precludes divine corporeality and anthropo- morphism.5 But such a model of divine transcendence is Hellenistic, not Semitic.6 The Abbreviations below follow the conventions of The Anchor Bible Dictionary and the Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition. 1 .

Bernhard W. Anderson [Philadelphia, 1984], 29). Daniel Boyarín, "The Eye in the Torah: Ocular Desire in Midrashic Hermeneutic," Critical Inquiry 16 (1990): 553 argues that "only under Hellenic influence do Jewish cultures exhibit any anxiety about the corporeality or visibility of God; the biblical and Rabbinic religions were quite free of such influences and anxieties" (emphasis original). 7.

Pritchard, "The Gods and Their Symbols," in idem, The Ancient Near East in Pictures Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton, 1954), 160-85; Stephen Herbert Langdon, Semitic Mythology (Boston, 1931). While theriomorphic representation of the divine is met with in all periods of religious history in the ANE, it does not seem to be the case that belief in anthropomorphism succeeded an earlier belief in theriomorphism. Already in 1939, Johannes Hemple ("Die Grenzen des Anthropomorphismus Jahwes im Alten Testament," ZAW 57 [1939]: 75) was able to dismiss this "naiven entwicklungsgeschichtlichen Auffassung . . . , daß etwa regelmäßig der Therio- morphismus dem Anthropomorphismus habe vorausgehen müssen." In fact, he pointed out "keine Aufeinanderfolge des Therio- und Anthropomorphismus klar nachweisbar ist." Henri Frankfort has pointed out that such a theory of Stufenfolge "ignores the fact that the earliest divine statues which have been preserved represent the god Min in human shape. Conversely, we find to the very end of Egypt's independence that gods were believed to be manifest in animals." See Ancient Egyptian Religion: An Interpretation (New York, 1948, 1961), 11.

But the latter, as Fazlur Rahman has pointed out, "does not emerge from the Qur5an, but from later theological development in Islam." 14 This "later theological development" included the appropriation of Hellenistic concepts and terms in order to in- terpret the Qur'an and the Sunna, particularly the statements about God.15 Early Islam was, among other things, clearly a formulation of ancient Near Eastern mythological tradition. 16 11.

Whether called Yahweh or Elohim, God the Father or Allah, it is the selfsame deity who created the world out of nothing."19 What then is the relation between the transcendently anthropomorphic Yahweh- Elohim and the incorporeal Allah? It will be argued here that at an earlier period Islam possessed a tradition of "transcendent anthropomorphism" similar in many ways to that articulated in ANE and biblical sources. Through the mediation of hellenistically-influenced schools such as the Muctazila, Greek- inspired notions of divine transcendence would eventually characterize all of Islam, Sunni and Shici alike.20 But while the triumph in Shicism was achieved by the third/ninth cen- 1965), 426-36; Geo Widengren, Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and His Ascension (King and Saviour 5) (Uppsala, 1955). Though ancient Arabia is sometimes thought of as religiously isolated from the ANE, archeological and epi- graphic evidence for North and South Arabia indicates otherwise. As relatively scant as this evidence is, nevertheless it clearly shows pre-Islamic Arabia to have been within the "mythological orbit" of the Near East, particularly in terms of motifs of the gods. For example, motifs associated with the cult of baetyls; the motif of the deity and his three hypostatic daughters; the motif of the winged disk and its tauroform compliment; the divine triad; and the motif of the anthropomorphic god surrounded by his divine assembly, all characteristic of the ANE mythic tradition, were part of the Arabian mythic tradition as well.

Sherman Jackson has pointed out that in early Muslim debates over the divine attributes Rationalist groups such as the Muctazila privileged Aristotelian-Neoplatonic logic and motifs while Traditionalists rejected them, at least ostensibly.22 It thus should come as no surprise that it is in traditionalist Sunnism that this ancient Semitic transcendent anthropomorphism survived well into the sixth/twelfth cen- tury.23 We will first document this ANE/biblical tradition of transcendent anthropomorphism and then explore its resonances in Islamic tradition. 2. THE BODY DIVINE IN ANCIENT TRADITION In ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean tradition the divine body was thought to be so sublime it bordered on the non-body.24 One of the distinguishing characteristics of this body divine is its dangerously luminous and fiery nature. The body of the gods shines with such an intense brilliance that no human eye can bear it. Its splendor is blinding ... if the god chooses to be seen in all his majesty, only the tiniest bit of the splendor of the god's size, stature, beauty and radiance can be allowed to filter through, and this already enough to strike the spectator with thambos, stupefaction, to plunge him into a state of reverential fear. . . .25 This "awe-inspiring luminosity" of the deities is in Akkadian termed pulhu melammû (Sum. ní.me.lám), an hendiadys meaning "fear, glory."26 This, as A. Leo Oppenheim told us in a seminal article, denotes a dazzling aureole or nimbus surrounding a divinity.27 The pulhu or puluhtu is often described as a supernatural garment of fire and flame.28 The ancient G.

Cassin, the melammû is better understood as the expression of a vital force in the form of pulsating light.32 Thus, pulhu melammû is the terrible epiphanic glory of the gods.33 Its radiance overwhelmed enemies on the battlefield:34 "The awe-inspiring splendor of Assur, my Lord, overwhelmed the men"; "the effulgence of his surpassing glory consumed them."35 Even deities seek shelter from the radiant splendor of the greater gods: "O my Lady (Inanna), the Anunna, the great gods,/Fluttering like bats fly off before you to clefts [in the rock],/ They who dare not walk [?] in your terrible glance, who dare not proceed before your ter- rible countenance."36 Theirs is "[a] body invisible in its radiation, a face that cannot be seen directly."37 To catch a glimpse of a deity could mean death for a human onlooker, because the mortal constitu- tion is unable to bear it.38 In order to be seen when such is desired or necessary, or in order to intervene directly in human affairs, the gods must conceal their divine forms.39 Conceal- ment is achieved either by veiling - enveloping the divine body in a mist, fog or cloud to become invisible40 - or by some sort of divine metamorphosis.41 This latter is usually done by reducing the divine size and splendor and taking on the appearance of a mortal human.42 29.

Yah weh has a body, clearly anthropomorphic, but too holy for human eyes . . . Yahweh's body was believed to be incommensurate with mundane human existence: it has a different degree of being than human bodies ... It is a transcendent anthropomorphism not in form but in its effect, approachable only by the most holy, and absent in material form in the cult . . . The body of God was defined in Israelite culture as both like and unlike that of humans.44 No doubt the signature feature of this Israelite transcendent anthropomorphism is a bril- liant luminosity that is the morphic manifestation of God's signature holiness.45 It is for this reason, we are given to understand, that humans cannot see God. Not because God is invis- ible, but because humans are unholy, and unholy beings are in great danger in the immediate presence of God's consuming, morphic holiness.46 This divine body is also characterized by a divine substance (rûaK) antithetical to mortal flesh (bãsãr).41 In the biblical canon this luminous divine body has been called in some sources his TOD, kãbôd.4* In the priestly material (P and Ezekiel) in particular, mrp TDD (kãbôd 43. Van der Toorn, "God (1)," 36 If.: "The Israelite concept of God shares many traits with the beliefs of its neighbors. The most fundamental correspondence concerns the anthropomorphic nature ascribed to God. God's anthropomorphism is external ... as well as internal (also called anthropopathism) . . . God's qualities are human qualities, yet purified from imperfection and amplified to superhuman dimensions. Sincerity and reliability are human virtues - even if only God is wholly sincere and reliable. Strength, too, is not the exclusive prerogative of God; he is merely incomparably stronger than humans or animals. In view of the passages dwelling upon the con- trast between God and man, the thesis of God's anthropomorphism should be modified in this sense that God is more than human. Though man has been created in the image of God . . . there is a huge difference of degree - yet not of nature. In this respect the view found in the Hebrew Bible does not radically differ from the conviction con- cerning the similarity between gods and humans in the Babylonian Atrahasis myth. God has human form, but not human size. In visions, God proves to be so high and exalted that the earthly temple can barely contain the fringes of his mantel (Isa. 6:1). Gates have to lift their heads when God enters Jerusalem (Ps. 24:7,9). In addition to his physical size (which transcends even the highest heaven, 1 Kgs 8:27), God surpasses humans in such aspects as wisdom (Job 32:13) and power (Ezek 28:9). His divine superiority also has a moral side: God excels in righteous- ness (Job 4:17; 9:2; 25:4), faithfulness (e.g., Deut 32:4), and other moral qualities." 44.

Also, p. 206: "The substance of the gods is of precious metals rather than "flesh," and so that word basar (flesh) is the only one among the many Hebrew words for body and its parts that is never applied to God, and is frequently contrasted to Yhwh as the very symbol of all that is mortal."

Peake (Oxford, 1925), 367: "Yahweh's body is shaped like man's, but its substance is not flesh but 'spirit,' and spirit seen as a blaze of light. It is true that the imageless worship of prophetic religion repudiates the making of any likeness of God, and no form was seen in the storm-theophany of Sinai (Deut. iv. 12). But it is one thing to shrink from the vision of the form, and another to deny that a form exists, though a form wrought out of rwac/z-substance."

Walther Eichrodt, Theology of the Old Testament, 2 vols. (Philadelphia, 1961), 2: 32 understood P's kãbôd to be "a formless brightness of light" and Julian Morgenstern, "Biblical Theophanies," ZA 25 (1911): 154 assumed that the kebhod Jahwe of P, other than being "something like fire" enveloped in the "cloud of Jahwe," has "no particular shape." But these claims are based on the false assumption that P's theology is anti-anthropomorphist, an assump- tion that is to be rejected. Weinfeld, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School, 200f. is surely correct: "Corporeal representation of the Deity in the Priestly document found its clearest expression in the conception of the 'Glory of God', against which the book of Deuteronomy promulgated its doctrine of 'God's Name'. The underlying imagery of the concept of God's Glory, 'the kabod of Yahweh," embedded in Priestly tradition is drawn from corporeal and not abstract terms"; Smith, Early History of God, 144 (= idem, Origins, 90): "The use of demut, "likeness," and selem, "image," in Genesis 1:26-28 presupposes the vision of the anthropomorphic god . . . Genesis 1 achieves the opposite effect of Ezekiel 1:26. While Ezekiel 1:26 conveys the prophet's vision of Yahweh in the likeness of the human person, Genesis 1 presents a vision of the human person in the likeness of the divine." See also Elliot R.

The priest-prophet sees God seated on a glorious throne: and seated above the likeness of a throne was something that seemed like a human form. Upward from what appeared like the loins I saw something like gleaming amber, something that looked like fire enclosed all around; and downward from what looked like the loins I saw something that looked like fire, and there was splendor all around. Like a bow in a cloud on a rainy day, such was the appearance of the splendor all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh (1:26-27, the New Oxford Annotated Bible translation). After this "emotional" description loaded with qualifiers, indicating that the prophet was searching for the right words to describe the undescribable,56 Ezekiel falls to the ground in a faint.57 Yahweh is here seen as an enthroned, transcendent anthropos (Ezek 1:1- 28).58 Ezekiel's vision of the deity is at once the most transcendent and the most anthropomorphic of the entire Bible. As Rimmon Kasher observes, "there is perhaps no other biblical prophet whose God is so corporeal as Ezekiel. Anthropomorphism did not, of course, originate with Ezekiel; the Bible offers many anthropomorphic descriptions of the Deity. . . . The prophet Ezekiel belongs to this general biblical tradition and in fact amplifies it."59 On the other hand Daniel I. Block notes that Ezekiel's vision of God is the height of divine transcen- dence as well: Two features of the image are especially significant. First, Ezekiel recognizes the form to be that of a human being ('ãdãm). Second, this was no ordinary man. What appeared to be his upper body radiated with the brilliance of amber (hasmal); his lower body seemed enveloped in a dazzling fiery glow as well. . . . With respect to force and awesomeness, no theophany in the entire OT matches Ezekiel's inaugural vision ... the vision proclaims the transcendent glory of God. Everything about the apparition proclaims his glory: the dazzling brilliance of the entire rightly said that Ezek. 1:26 is the theological prelude to the locus classicus for the imago doctrine in Gen. 1:26 ... nevertheless at the same time an infinite difference and distance is tacitly recognized - first in the matter of mere stature, for Israel conceived Jahweh as gigantic (Mie. I. 3ff.; Is. LXIII. Iff.; Ps. XXIV. 9), but also different and dis- tant as regards quality, for the kãbõd which man has cannot, of course, be remotely compared with the fiery, in- tensely radiant light which is the nature of Jahweh . . . Jahweh himself was conceived as man."

Everything about the vision cries "Glory!" (cf. Ps. 29:9), even the prophet's frustrating search for adequate forms of expression. . . . Everything about the vision is in the superlative mode. God is alone above the platform, removed from all creatures, and stunning in his radiance.60 This biblical transcendent anthropomorphism had a long afterlife in post-biblical Jewish (especially apocalyptic and mystical/esoteric61), Christian,62 and, it will be argued, Islamic traditions. 3. THE PROBLEM OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN ISLAMIC HISTORIOGRAPHY And argue not with the People of the Book except by what is best, save such of them as act unjustly. But say: We believe in that which has been revealed to us and to you, and our God and your God is One (ilãhunã wa-ilãhukum wãhid), and to Him we submit. (Surat al- cAnkabut [29]:46) It is our claim that Islam, as a formulation of the ANE/Semitic tradition, once possessed a similar tradition of transcendent anthropomorphism. Now, "transcendent anthropomorphism" presupposes, of course, anthropomorphism and most Muslim scholars assure us that Islam does not countenance this. Nevertheless, the subject was hotly debated in early Islam. James Pavlin has argued that the "major theological controversies in Islam . . . revolve(d) around the nature of God and His Attributes"63 and, according to Richard C. Martin, "the problems of anthropomorphism and corporealism lay at the heart of the disputes about God in Islamic 60. The Book ofEzekiel: Chapters 1-24 (Grand Rapids, Mich., 1997), 104, 106, 108. 61.

With only a little ingenuity in one-sidedness an absolutely anthropomorphic deity could be put together, or a practically pantheistic, or a coldly and aloofly rationalistic (deity)."66 The Sunna, as Daniel Gimaret noted, "ne se borne pas à reprendre ceux, encore relativement vagues et abstraits, du Coran, elle les amplifie, les précise, les concretize."67 A Quranic hand becomes a palm with five fingers and fingertips in the Sunna, etc.68 How is this imagery to be understood? Literally? Metaphorically? This question at times occupied center stage in the theological debate. The real issue, of course, was the authority of scripture.69 Studies treating Islamic anthropomorphism and the debates surrounding it are relatively few.70 Nor do Western scholars agree on the place of anthropomorphism in the history of Islamic thought. Views range, for example, from the extremes of Helmut Ritter, who claimed that for Muslim orthodoxy the idea of an anthropomorphic deity was nothing less than "ein 64.

While the former term literally refers to man's "form" (morphë), it more often than not is made to bear the burden of signifying all ascriptions of human likeness to God. Thus, human emotions, thoughts, and actions, properly anthropopathisms and anthro- popoiesis, are subsumed under the designation anthropomorphism. Because Homeric an- thropomorphism with its repugnant acting deities is usually the standard and no consideration is given to the idea of an "ethical anthropomorphism," the net effect of this subsumption, if you will, is that discussion of the alleged "form" of God, the main point of the term "anthro- pomorphism," is often de-emphasized or assumed to be a non-issue:73 certainly the scrip- tures could not have really meant to depict God "as a disarmingly familiar figure who acts in ways that often seem improbable for a divinity if not outrightly inappropriate."74 But at least the biblical tradition of transcendent anthropomorphism, articulated as it is in the con- text of an ethical monotheism, should caution us with regard to this line of reasoning. It is, I believe, because of this uncritical and inappropriate conflation of anthropomorphism and tashbih that an accurate account of Islam's theological struggle over the issue of God's attributes has yet to be written. 3.1. Tashbih versus 'Anthropomorphism" The verbal form sh-b-h means literally "to liken (s.o. or s.th. to s.o/th. else)," thus shibh "similar to," shabah "likeness, resemblance," and tashbih "assimilation/making similar." This term is not used in the Qur'an except once, in reference to the death of Jesus (4:157). Nevertheless Muslim theologians of all eras and persuasions were unanimous in regarding tashbih, that is to say, "likening God to creation," as condemnable. The problem is that in many cases tashbih does not mean, and should not be translated as, "anthropomorphism"; some of Islam's, we would say "crudest," anthropomorphists have been as adamant against tashbih as the anti-anthropomorphists.75 In fact, taking the history of Islamic discourse on the issue into consideration, it is desirable that scholars discontinue the ready translation of tashbih by anthropomorphism, as such a practice inhibits our understanding of the nuances involved in the discussion. Take, for example, Ahmad b. Hanbal (d. 241/855), the "patron saint of the traditionalists" and the Shibboleth of Sunni orthodoxy.76 We have elsewhere demonstrated that Ibn Hanbal quite unequivocally was an anthropomorphist in the strict sense: he was adamant about God's anthropoid form.77 To deny it is tantamount to kufr.7S Ibn Hanbal was, if you will, "a true 71.

Yet he disavowed tashbih in no uncertain terms: God's anthropo- morphism is not "like" that of man. When asked about the statements of the mushabbiha or likeners Ibn Hanbal is said to have replied: "He who says 'sight like my sight, hand like my hand, foot like my foot,' he likens God to His creation, and this limits Him, and this is evil speech which I do not like."79 It is also reported that he was asked: "Is our Lord not similar to anything from His creation (and) does one not compare Him to anything from His creation?" to which he replied, "Yes, there is nothing like Him (nacm, laysa ka-mithlihi shay'in [Q 42: II])."80 It is, rather, the radically anti- anthropomorphist Jahmiyya who are the true mushabbiha}1 In a telling remark Ibn Hanbal accuses the Jahmiyya of tashbih for likening God to man by denying that His speech was eternal: You have, by this assertion, likened Allah to His creatures for, according to your belief, there was a time when He did not speak. So are the sons of men, who could not speak until He created speech for them. This is kufr and tashbih together. Far be it from Allah! We say the opposite: Allah was always the speaker when He wished. We do not maintain that He was without speech until He created it; nor do we say that He was without knowledge until He created it; nor do we say that He was without power, light or might until He created them for Himself.82 Contrary to God's creatures, which had to wait for Him to create their speech, God was never without this ability. While both God and man speak with a real voice,83 God had His speech from eternity. Thus it is the Jahmiyya who are guilty of tashbih or likening God to His creation. The Muctazilite Abu 1-Husayn al-Khayyãt, in his Kitãb al-Intisãr, even labeled Jahm b. Safwãn (d. 128/746), the eponymous founder of the Jahmiyya, "the imam of the mushabbiha."*4 His sin was apparently that he likened God's knowledge of things to man's by his claim that God knows things only after those things come into existence. There is no way one could translate mushabbih here as "anthropomorphist." As Daniel Gimaret points out, "ce qui caractérise les gahmiyya, c'est fondamentalement . . . leur antianthropomor- phisme."85 Jahm could not tolerate the embodied God of his traditionalist contemporaries.86 None would thus accuse him of anthropomorphism - assimilation maybe, anthropomorphism (stricto sensu) impossible. This highlights the point we are making: the term tashbih is vague and nuanced enough as to preclude any ready translation as "anthropomorphism." One could not only disavow tashbih while affirming an anthropoid form for God, as with Ibn Hanbal, but one could also disavow the latter and still be guilty of the former, as with Jahm. In light of this, how are we to understand Strothmann's claim that "Ahmad b. Hanbal has become the great orthodox authority against tashbih"^7 Is Strothmann claiming Ibn Hanbal as an authority against assimilating God to man, which the Imam indeed seems to have been; 79.

The latter claim, which seems to be Strothmann's intent, is untenable in light of our review of the sources testifying to Ibn Hanbal's creed.88 But it is in Henri Laoust's article on Ibn Hanbal in the Encyclopaedia of Islam where the dangers of an uncritical rendering of tashbïh is most clearly illustrated. Laoust noted: Ibn Hanbal . . . rejects the negative theology {ta'tïl) of the D[ahmiyya and their allegorizing exegesis (ta'wïl) of the Kur'an and of tradition, and no less emphatically rejects the anthro- pomorphism {tashbïh) of the Mushabbiha, amongst whom he includes ... the Djahmiyya as unconscious anthropomorphists.89 We should clearly see here the inappropriateness of conflating tashbïh and anthropomor- phism. Ibn Hanbal affirmed the latter (i.e., anthropomorphism), but rejected the former {tashbïh)', and he accused the Jahmiyya of the former {tashbïh), but not of the latter (an- thropomorphism). This is not to say that tashbïh never has the meaning of anthropo- morphism in the sources. It certainly does. But this has to be determined by the context.90 3.2. There is nothing like Him? At the heart of this semantic issue is the nature and degree of the "likeness" posited or prohibited: absolute likeness vs. only relative likeness. Taqï 1-Dïn Ahmad Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) argued that the term tashbïh can denote a properly acknowledgeable degree of likeness between Creator and created (i.e., relative likeness), and it can also denote an improper degree of similarity (absolute likeness) whose disavowal is mandatory.91 This nuance is most clearly articulated by the Hanafì qadï Ibn Abi l-cIzz (d. 792/1390) in his Sharh al-cAqïda al-tahãwiyya. Ibn Abi l-cIzz begins by noting that the term tashbïh had be- come with the people "rather vague" {lafz mujmal).92 He, too, suggests that there is an improper tashbïh prohibited by the QurDan wherein an identity is posited between Creator and created, and a proper or allowable tashbïh wherein only a general or limited correspon- dence is posited. Whoever denies the latter is as guilty as he who affirms the former: It is clear . . . that the Creator and the created are similar in some respects and differ in others {ittifãquhumã min wajhi wa-ikhtilãfuhumã min wajh). And whoever denies what is common between them is a negator and is surely mistaken. On the other hand, whoever makes them homogeneous {mutamãthilayn) is a mushabbih and is equally mistaken. And Allah knows best. 88. See Williams, "Aspects of the Creed." 89. El2, 1: 275a s.v. Ahmad b. Hanbal (Laoust). 90. For example, al-Baghdãdi (Kitãb Usui al-dìn [Istanbul, 1928], 74 1. 14-p. 75) clearly has anthropomor- phism in mind when he criticizes the mushabbiha: [The mushabbiha] said: "We likened Him to man's image because of His saying, may He be exalted, 'surely We created man in the most beautiful creation (Q 95:4)'." They said: "The most beautiful creation is a creation in the image of God." Also they brought forth as proof the saying of the Prophet, may God bless him and give him peace, "God created man in His [own?] image." And they brought as a proof for His having organs His saying, "The face of your Lord does last (Q 55:27)" and "I created by My hands (Q 38:75)." And [it is said] in a tradition: "The Omnipotent put His foot in fire." And they related: "The believer's heart is between two of God's fingers." 91.

He argues that these are not mere homonyms, such as mushtarl (which means both buyer and the planet Jupiter), similar in name only: the attributes of God and man share a common element denoted by the term.94 They differ in that those of God are attributes of perfection (sifãt al-kamãl), whereas man's comprise imperfections.95 As noted above, tashblh is not used in the Qur3an in reference to God. Instead, the pivotal verse wherein God's otherness is most forcefully and (it would seem) clearly articulated - Q 42:11, "There is nothing like Him {lay sa ka-mithlihi shay y - uses a different root m-th-l "to be like, compare," mithl "similar, image," tamthll "assimilation, likening." This verse is said to reject "all anthropomorphism."96 But the same expression ("there is nothing like him") was used for anthropomorphic deities prior to the Quranic revelation. It was found already in ancient Egyptian temple inscriptions of the Ptolemaic period.97 In this context it meant simply that there is no other god like that god.98 Likewise, Second Isaiah's theologi- cally important dictum, "To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with me" (Isa 40:18-20), is not a rejection of anthropomorphism;99 rather it "is meant to show the inferiority of man-made idols," and this in the specific sense of immovability and unshake- ability.100 Indeed, the very same formulas used to describe Yahweh's incomparability ("Who is like" [mí fé]; "there is none like" Yen fé]) is similarly used to describe the incomparability of men and Israel: "Who is like (mi fé) the wise man?" (Eccles 8:1); "There is none like him (Saul) among all the people" (I Sam 10:24). 101 For Israel the dictum of Second Isaiah was not a rejection of anthropomorphism but an affirmation of the paradox of transcendent anthropomorphism. As Robert Dentan in The Knowledge of God in Ancient Israel puts it: The particular paradox of belief in an anthropomorphic deity who is nevertheless utterly different from man is related to other paradoxes, and especially to the familiar one which declares that God is both transcendent and immanent, a paradox of which Israel was fully aware. She knew . . . that God was both like man, and yet entirely different from him. 102 The Quranic context seems also to indicate that a denial of anthropomorphism was not what the verse necessarily intended. "And the blind and the seeing are not alike" (mã yastawï, 93. Ibn Abi l-cIzz, Sharh, 1: 62 (= Commentary, 27). 94. Ibid., 1: 63 (= Commentary, 28). 95. Ibid., 1: 93ff. (= Commentary, 44ft'). The definite article used with God's attributes is probably germane here, e.g., al-cAmïn (God) vs. &lt;amïn (the Prophet). 96.

The man who can see (presumably the truth of revelation) is contrasted with the man who cannot. It is certainly not to be inferred that one of the men is embodied while the other is not. The difference - that which constitutes their "unlikeness" or "otherness" - lies elsewhere. Like- wise, in Q 33:32 ("O wives of the Prophet, you are not like (lastunna ka-) any other women") the same lay sa ka- construction is used as in Q 42:1 1. Whether or not the differ- ence lies in the other women's lower order of merit, as Goldziher thought, it is clear that there is no polemic here against anthropomorphism. 103 According to Ibn Hanbal, Q. 42:11 was from among the mutashãbihãt or ambiguous verses that required explanation, 104 and a proper explanation did not preclude an anthro- poid deity. It was, says Ibn Hanbal, Jahm b. Safwãn who first used this verse in an anti- anthropomorphist manner to support his novel doctrine of God as "an invisible spirit."105 On the other hand, a review of the exegetical history of this verse (Q 42:11) indicates that this verse was actually first employed by advocates of anthropomorphism in support of their position.106 In Ibn al-Jawzi's time (d. 597/1201) it was still in the service of the anthropo- morphists.107 This seems quite amazing. What is it about laysa ka-mithlihi shay* that lent itself to the exegetical needs of reputed anthropomorphists? Syntactically, the ka could be read as a syndetic relative cause (sila) added for emphasis, in which case the reading would be something like, "There (really) is nothing like Him." If the ka is taken as a non-expletive, however, it would then read, "There is nothing like (ka) His likeness (mithlihi)" As Ibn al-Jawzï noted, "taken literally (zãhir) these words indicate that God has a mithl, which is like nothing and like which there is nothing."108 Ibn al-Jawzï cites this verse as one of the proof-texts of the so-called anthropomorphists. They obviously took the mithl here anthropomorphically. But how so? The mithl of Q 42:11 was probably understood in these circles as a reference to God's form, sura, which term is a synonym of mithãl. 109 His mithl "likeness," Ibn al-cArabi claims, is Adam, the Perfect Man (al-insän al- kãmil).110 Adam was made "according to the süra/mithäl (form/image) of God," according to a Prophetic tradition111 and he appeared to Muhammad in an ahsan sura, according to other reports.112 God's ahsan süra, His most beautiful form, was exegetically associated with Adam's ahsan taqwim "most beautiful stature" (95:4), and both with God's süra accord- ing to which Adam was made.113 Adam's "most beautiful stature" and God's "most beautiful form" are therefore identical, at least in those circles so inclined. These exegetes might even have solicited the aid of sura al-Nahl (16:60): li-llähi l-mathal al-a(lã.U4 God's "highest likeness" (al-mathal al-aHa) here could conceivably be identified with His incomparable mithl of Q 42:1 1, and then with His anthropoid süra. 103.

A BODY UNLIKE BODIES Belief that God possessed a visibly perceivable (though not earthly) body ... is reflected in early Islamic sources. (EQ, s.v. Face of God) Understanding Q 42: 1 1 to prohibit only absolute likeness but allow for relative likeness between Creator and creature, allowed one to both disavow tamthll/tashbïh and affirm an anthropoid form for God.115 As Josef van Ess observed: The statement [Q 42:11] did not decide the question whether dissimilarity between God and man was absolute or relative . . . Why should not the intention of the Quranic verse be satisfied when God is merely considered to be different, perhaps by his dimensions, or by the matter He is composed of, or by the consistency of the matter?116 Van Ess is not being rhetorical here. Take, for example, the famed early Quranic exegete Muqãtil b. Sulaymãn (d. 150/767), probably Islam's most notorious anthropomorphist, who claimed that God is a body in the form of a man, with flesh, blood, hair, and bones. He has limbs and members, including a hand, a foot, a head, and eyes, and He is solid. Nonetheless, He does not resemble anything else, nor does anything resemble Him.117 Muqatil's flesh and blood deity was yet unlike His creation. How is He different? "Bi- qudra," said Muqãtil. 118 Or, as Abu Tammäm's Nãbita believed, huwa shay* lã ka-1-ashyã* minjihat al-qidam ("He is a being unlike beings in respect of sempiternity").119 Morphi- cally, Muqãtil claimed that God is musmat, "compact" through and through, possessing no stomach cavity or "hollowness" which obviously distinguished the divine form from the human. 120 These early Muslim exegetes saw no problem harmonizing their anthropomor- phism with the Quranic affirmation that there is none like Him. They coined the early for- mula, jism lã ka-1-ajsãm ("a body unlike bodies").121 Later Muslim theologians interpreted this verse in a similar fashion. Muhammad b. Sacdün, better known as Abu cAmir al-Qurashï (d. 1130), famous Andalusian theologian, said: The [anti-anthropomorphists] heretics cite in evidence the QurDan verse 'Nothing is like Him,' but the meaning of that verse is only that nothing can be compared to God in His divinity. In form, however, God is like you or me. 122 115. Van Ess, TG, 4: 378. 116. Van Ess, "The Youthful God," 3. 1 17. al-Ashcari, Maqãlãt al-islamiyyïn, ed. Helmut Ritter (Istanbul, 1929-1933), 152f.

Allah al-Samad: Islam's massive deity In an order of conversion of Muslims to the Byzantine Church appended to the Twentieth Book of Nicetas Chômâtes' (ca. 1155-ca. 1215/6) Thesaurus Orthodoxiae, one anathema against Islam reads in part: And on top of all these, I anathematize the god of Muhammad, about whom he [Muhammad] says that "This is one God, holosphyros [made of solid metal beaten to a spherical shape] who neither begat nor was begotten, and no-one has been made like him." Thus, by anathematizing everything that I have stated, even Muhammad himself and his sphyrelaton [beaten solid] god, and by renouncing them, I am siding with Christ, the only true God. ... 125 On the basis of internal evidence Franz Cumont plausibly argued for a mid-Umayyad Syrian provenance of this anathema. 126 What catches our attention is how the God of Islam is described. Holosphyros and sphyrelaton, quite common descriptions in Byzantine anti- Islamic polemical literature,127 are clearly attempts to translate the Arabic epithet samad found in Q 112:2, the hapax legomenon of the Qur'an. Al-Samad was a popular divine epithet during the Umayyad period, particularly in Syria. 128 While the precise sense of the epithet was debated in the Classical Arabic literature, and is still in Western scholarship,129 these Greek translations are not necessarily polemical distortions. 13° In fact, they seem to be based on a genuine Arabic tradition of interpreting the epithet and God similarly. By at least the time of al-Tabari (d. 310/923) a popular reading equated samad with musmat, "solid, of even composition, massive, compact, or not hollow (i.e., without a stomach cavity)."131 Al-Ashcarï (d. 324/936), in his Maqãlãt al-islãmiyyln observed, "Many people say, 'He [God] is solid,' interpreting the word of God, samad, to mean solid, i.e., not hollow."132 There were variations of this theme as well.

Mascüd (d. 32/652) re- lating Adam's creation (ad Q 2:30). After God molded the human body of Adam from clay the body was left standing as a hollow, lifeless statue for forty days. During this time, the angels saw Adam and were terrified at the sight, none more than Iblïs, the devil. Iblïs would strike Adam's body, making a hollow ring. He then went into Adam's body through his mouth, exiting through his rear. Iblïs then said to the frightened angels, "Do not be afraid of this: your Lord is solid (samad), but this is hollow. Indeed, if I am given power over it, I shall utterly destroy it."135 This last statement gives us the reason why the angels were ter- rified: they thought the Adam statue was God. "God created Adam according to His form," we are told in a prophetic hadlth found in the sahlh collections. 136 This idea has a Jewish precedent. In Genesis Kabbah, we read: "Said R. Hoshaiah: When the Holy One, blessed be He, came to create the first man, the ministering angels mistook him (viz. Adam) [for God, since man was in God's image,] and wanted to say before him, 'Holy, [holy, holy is the Lord of hosts]'."137 In the Islamic version, the angels are disabused of this belief once it was learned that Adam's body was hollow; Allah, the angels well knew, had a compact and solid (samad) body. 138 In this context we can see the logic of a statement attributed to Abu Muhammad b. Qutayba (d. 276/889): "God possesses an actual form, though it is not like other forms, and He fashioned Adam after it."139 The difference between divine and human anthropomorphism, at least according to this formulation, is therefore that while God's an- thropoid form is samad/musmat, Adam's was ajwaf "hollow."140 Muqãtil b. Sulaymãn and, especially, Däwüd al-Jawâribï were probably on the margins of the General Religious Movement of the Formative Period. 141 But there is evidence sug- gesting that such notions as they represented might at one time have been more centrally placed. In particular some mythic traditions associated with the Dome of the Rock built in Jerusalem by the Umayyad Caliph cAbd al-Malik (r. 65-86/685-705) link the Caliph him- self with such notions. A number of Fada'il Bayt al-Maqdis ("The Merits of Jerusalem") reports identify the Rock (al-Sakhra) as God's earthly throne on which he resided for forty 133.

TRANSCENDENT ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND TRADITIONALIST SUNNISM These particular formulations of transcendent anthropomorphism are pretty marginal to Sunnism as it developed in the third/ninth century onward. Instead, in traditionalist Sunnism in particular, the formulation characteristic of the ANE/biblical sources treated above took root. The Qur'an seems to share the biblical/ ANE tradition of God's luminosity: "And the earth is lit up with the light (nur) of its Lord (39:69)"; "And Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth (22:35)"; "Your Lord's Face (wajh), possessor of Glory (jalãl) and honor, [alone] will survive (55:27)." Jalãl is "suggestive of effulgence"147 and sura al-Shüra [42]:50 sug- gests that this luminosity is veiled when God communicates to humans.148 According to a number of hadlth reports, the veil protects man from the scorching effulgence of God's Face. "His [God's] veil is light. If He would remove it, the august splendor of Allah's Face would burn everything of His creation to which His glance reaches."149 Sura al-A'raf [7]: 143, which depicts an actual theophany, seems to describe a "partial" manifestation (tajallã) of God's luminosity (jalãl), whose effects leveled the mountain and knocked Moses uncon- scious.150 The veil over God's Face intervening between Him and man's vision of Him is 142.

As Muhammad b. Ishãq b. Khuzayma (d. 31 1/924), the most prominent Shâficï in Nishapur at the time, eloquently wrote: God has affirmed for Himself a Splendid and Venerable face, which He declares is eternal and non-perishable. We and all scholars of our madhhab from the Hijaz, the Tihama, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Egypt affirm for God (the) face, which He has affirmed for Himself. We profess it with our tongues and believe it in our hearts, without likening (ghayr an nushabbiha) His face to one from His creatures. May our Lord be exalted above our likening Him to His creatures . . . We and all our scholars in all our lands say that the one we worship has a face . . . And we say that the face of our Lord (radiates) a brilliant, radiant light (al-nür wa-l-diyãy wa-l-bahãy) which, if His veil is removed the glory of His face will scorch everything that sees it. His eyes are veiled from the people of this world who will never see Him during this life . . . The face of our Lord is eternal. . . . Now God has decreed for human faces destruction and denied them splendor and venerability. They are not attributed the light, brilliance or splendor {al-nür wa-l-diyãy wa-l-bahãy) that He described His face with. Eyes in this world may catch human faces without the latter scorching so much as a single hair . . . Human faces are rooted in time (muhdatha) and created . . . Every human face perishes . . . O, you possessors of reason (dhawã al-hijan), could it ever really occur to any one with sense and who knows Arabic and knows what tashbih (means) that this (tran- sient and dull human) face is like that (splendidly brilliant face of God)?153 We have here the affirmation of anthropomorphism and the concomitant disavowal of tashbih. Ibn Khuzayma adamantly argues for God's possession of a true face, but one dangerously radiant and non-perishable, in contrast to man's perishable and dull face: transcendent anthro- pomorphism. The "chief of the traditionalists" (rays al-muhaddithln) asks, in short, "Can one who acknowledges these differences be charged with tashbihV Certainly not according to the language of the Arabs! 5.7. Theomorphism and divine beauty Characteristic of the transcendent anthropomorphism of the ancient gods is their divine beauty. 154 We find a similar motif in traditionalist Sunnism. [Mucãdh b. Jabal] narrates: One morning, the Messenger of God took a long time to come join us for the dawn prayer, until the moment when we were on the point of seeing the sun come up. The Prophet then came out hurriedly. They did the second call to prayer, and the Messenger of God did the prayer, but his prayer was short. When he had pronounced the final salutation, he shouted to us: "Remain in rows as you are!" Then he turned towards us and said: "I am going to tell you what made me late this morning. I got up last night [to pray]. I did the ablution, I prayed what destiny wished that I pray; then while I was praying, sleepiness overtook me, and I fell asleep. And there, in front of me, was my Lord, in the most beautiful form (fl ahsani sürati). He said [to me]: O Muhammad! - [Yes] Lord, here I am! He said [to me]: Over what 151.

He posed [to me] again two times the same question.

Such a theophany offended the sensibilities of the anti-anthropomorphist theologians who subjected the report to de-anthropomorphizing interpretations. The Ashcarite Ibn Fürak, for example, recounts in his Mushkil al-hadlth wa-bayãnuh several interpretations advanced by the theologians: either the "most beautiful form" refers to the Prophet who saw God while in this state, or it refers to a created form used by God to communicate to His Prophet, or even the form of an angel in which God inheres. 157 The ashãb al-hadlth polemicized violently against these hermeneutics. Abu Sacïd cUthmãn b. Sacïd al-Darimï, a leading traditionalist of Harãt (d. 280/ 895), argued in his Naqd calã l-Marïsl: "Woe to you! It is not possible that this is Gabriel, or Mïka'ïl, or Israfìl; it is not possible that this [form] is other than Allah."158 Other anti-anthropomorphist scholars impugned the authenticity of the hadlth,159 but the traditionalists generally accepted it.

Al-Dãrimi, among others, did "totally reject"186 this hadlth al-shãbb from Ibn cAbbãs because, he argues, it is opposed by contrary reports from Abu Darr and ^isha, according to which Muhammad never saw God.187 However, one or more of these reports generally had great support among the Traditionalists. Ibn Hanbal,188 cAbd Allah b. Ahmad,189 Ibn Abï cÃsim,190 cAbd Allah b. cAdi,191 al-Tabarãni,192 al-LälakäV93 and Muhammad b. al-Husayn al-Ãjurri 194 reported it in full or abridged (mukhtasar). 195 Even al-Ashcari counted the vision as a true vision (rvfya haqlqd). 196 Authentic or not, traditionalist Sunnism was characterized - and caricaturized197 - by belief in this corporeal and theophanous deity. 198 We learn from the Zaydï imam al-Qãsim b. Ibrahim (d. 246/860) that the popular proto-Sunni movement that looked to Ibn Hanbal as its figurehead accepted the report and based its view of God on it. 199 Writing around the same time, the Muctazili essayist al-Jãhiz (d. 255/869) describes the same doctrinal trend among the proto-Sunnis.200 The rescript of Caliph al-Rãdi, issued in 935 against the Baghdad! Hanbalis, condemns them for anthropomorphist views based on hadlth al-shãbb,201 and the Muctazilite qãdl cAbd al-Jabbãr (d. 415/1025) noted that, in the eleventh century doubt originated with these hadlths; see, e.g., Annemarie Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam (Chapel Hill, 1975), 290.

Abu Yaclã (d. 458/1066), for example, "the major leader and prime mover of the Hanbalite movement" in his day and clearly a leading influence on Hanbalism/Sunnism for a good part of the eleventh century,204 declared that the traditions concerning the Divine Attributes must be taken literally ((alã zãhirihã) and that they are not to be likened to the same attributes in creation.205 This includes the de- scriptions of God as a beardless, curly-haired, young man.206 God's is a transcendent anthropomorphism. If it is said, "He is a corporeal person (shakhs201) or form (sum)" it [should be] said: The report from different routes on the night of the mi'raj mentioned, "I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form" . . . And the application of that is not to be refused. Just as "soul" (nafs) not like souls and essence (dhãt) not like essences were not denied Him. Likewise form unlike forms, for the Sharica [uses it in this manner].208 6. CONCLUSION Sherman Jackson has pointed out that: At the center of virtually all of the debates ... is the problem of how to affirm God's attributes and transcendence without falling into anthropomorphism, on the one hand, and without emptying God's attributes of concrete meaning, on the other. Whatever the approach taken to this dilemma ... no school of Muslim theology has showed a willingness to compromise on the question of God's transcendence.209 Sherman Jackson is certainly correct that none of the various theological schools was willing to compromise God's transcendence: the Creator was different from and so far above His creation.

We have shown that these two are not mutually ex- clusive either in a history-of-religions context generally or in the Islamic context specifically. Muslim thinkers were able to affirm both God's anthropomorphism and His "otherness." This characteristically ancient Near Eastern and Semitic tradition of transcendent anthro- pomorphism, while replaced by the Muctazila and the Shica with the incorporeal transcen- dence of Hellenism, survived in traditionalist Sunnism through traditions describing God's paramount morphic beauty and luminosity. We cannot hope to fully elucidate the place of an- thropomorphist doctrines in the history of Islamic theological development in such a brief study. A larger study is underway. Rather our objective here is much more modest: to urge methodological caution and to suggest a third option to which some availed themselves during the classical debates over the divine attributes. This problematizes many current treat- ments of Islamic theology which tend to take the near universal polemic against tashbïh as a rejection of anthropomorphism.210 In 1967 historian of religion- turned-Islamicist Charles Adams lamented the fact that, on his reading, Islam is "extraordinarily, one may say perversely," impervious to a history-of- religions analysis.211 According to Adams, "the mainstream of Islamic tradition," by which he means traditionalist Sunnism, lacks mythological expression. While Sufism and Shicism enjoy a "richness of symbolic expression," the juridical-theology of Sunnism is "markedly rationalistic in self-expression and determinedly iconoclastic."212 This is certainly true of modern articulations of Islam, but our brief study has suggested that the juridical theology of classical traditionalist Sunnism was quite rich in mythological expression and this expres- sion is consistent with the biblical and ANE mythic tradition. This tradition of transcendent anthropomorphism, which seems presupposed in the Qur'an as well, places Islam squarely within the tradition of "Oriental monotheism," the Semitic monotheism anchored in the ANE mythic tradition.213 This study therefore offers more optimistic prospects for a history-of- religions analysis of Islam. 210.
