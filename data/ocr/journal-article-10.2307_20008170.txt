Printed in the United Kingdom C I998 Cambridge University Press Divine Fission: A New Way of Moderating Social Trinitarianism PETER FORREST Discipline of Philosophy, School of Social Science, University of New England, Armidale, NSW 235i, Australia Abstract. This paper is a contribution to the programme of moderating Social Trinitarianism to achieve a fairly orthodox result. I follow Swinburne in relying heavily on divine thisnessless and in the important speculation that the Trinity arose from a primordial 'unitarian' God. In this paper I explain why I disagree with Swinburnes's account of how the Trinity came into being and I propose an alterna tive in which the primordial God fissions into three divine persons for the sake of a loving community. The topic of this paper is a way of speculating about the Trinity in which we start with a heterodox Social Trinitarianism and then moderate it to ensure that various desiderata are satisfied. We could think of this as the synthetic approach: understanding God as a unity formed out of three divine persons. This may be contrasted with the analytic approach in which we start with the one God and discover the three persons in God. St Augustine's Psycho logical Trinitarianism is an example of that analytic approach. But neither the analytic approach nor ways of seeing the two approaches as compatible are within the scope of this paper. I note, however, that one promising way of combining the approaches is to use Geach's relative identity theory of the Trinity. This has recently been defended by Van Inwagen who notes its antecedents in the Athanasian Creed.' Indeed I suspect this is the only way of achieving literal conformity with that creed, which however, is not the decree of any ecumenical council. I do, however, respect it because of its traditional use in Christian liturgy. There is a proviso, though, namely that its authority is of an informal kind and so, I hold, there is no need to conform to it literally. Subject to that proviso I shall take respect for the Athanasian creed as one of the desiderata for social trinitarians. I note at the outset that I shall not be considering the case for believing that there are no more than three divine persons, as opposed to believing there are at least three and then suspending judgement about whether there are any more. Nonetheless for convenience of exposition I shall take myself to be defending the traditional doctrine. My starting point is Swinburne's Moderate Social Trinitarianism (Ch. ' See Peter van Inwagen, 'And Yet They Are Not Three Gods but One God', in God, Knowledge and Mystery: Essays in Philosophical Theology (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, I995), pp. 222-259.

Bartel, 'The Plight of the Relative Trinitarian', Religious Studies 24 (I988), I29-55.</page><page sequence="2">282 PETER FORREST 8),2 explaining where I disagree and where I think more needs to be said. In spite of these disagreements I am heavily indebted to Swinburne's clear and coherent speculation about the Trinity. And I follow him both in holding that divine persons lack thisness and in what I take to be the most significant feature of his speculation. This is the way he starts with an account of the existence and nature of a God who is a single divine person only - the primordial God in my terminology. Swinburne then explains how the Trin ity could arise from the primordial God. I take this to be important as an objection to the widespread assumption that the Trinity is more mysterious, and so intellectually more expensive, than mere theism. I grant, however, that the sort of speculation he gives is in some way 'abstract' or 'arid'. In this paper I shall have occasion to note both intellectual and affective versions of various desiderata for Trinitarianism. It is my contention that the affective aspects of religion presuppose the ' arid' intellectual aspects, so the former are incomplete without the latter. I hope that my speculative de velopment of Moderate Social Trinitarianism both illustrates and supports this contention. The most striking difference between my speculation and Swinburne's is in our answers to the question: 'How is the Trinity possible?' His speculation is that the First Person is the ultimate cause of all things. I reject this because I identify the ultimate cause of all things with the God who is the Trinity, not the First Person. Accordingly, I speculate that the Trinity arises as a result of fission by the primordial God, rather than the primordial God bringing other divine persons into existence. I. SWINBURNE 'S SOCIAL TRINITARIANISM I shall assume that we have a good enough grasp of what it is to be a human person. And I assume that, in spite of the historical influence in the other direction, we now form the idea of a divine person by analogy with that of a human person.3 I shall also assume that we have a good grasp of the sort of gods which polytheists worship. These gods are divine persons who, unlike the three persons of the Trinity, are individuals in much the sense that we are. I take it that this individuality is what lies behind the 'all too human' antics of the gods of Greek, Indian and other mythologies. My starting point is a certain kind of monotheism: God is not an atemporal being but one who of necessity exists at all times and of necessity is a good, loving being at all times. My speculation is compatible with, but does not require, the further claims that: (i) of necessity God has complete knowledge 2 Unless otherwise indicated all references to Swinburne are to: Richard Swinburne, The Christian God (Oxford: Clarendon Press, I994). 3 See David Brown, 'Trinity, Personhood and Individuality', in Trinity, Incarnation and Atonement (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, I989), pp. 2 I-47 for an account of the development of the concept of a person and the relevance of this to the doctrine of the Trinity.</page><page sequence="3">MODERATING SOCIAL TRINITARIANISM 283 of other things which exist; (2) of necessity God has complete power over all other things to bring into existence any possible kind of universe and to control what has been brought into existence; and (3) of necessity no other things can exist without God's sustaining them. In all the above we should ask what sort of necessity is being considered. Here I follow Swinburne (Ch. 5) and distinguish ontological necessity from mere metaphysical necessity. Ontological necessity is that which is both metaphysically necessary and uncaused. Consider an act by God required by the divine goodness. For example, suppose that there is a best kind of universe. Then, I would hold, it is required by the divine goodness that God create a universe of that kind. The resultant product of any such divine act would be metaphysically necessary but not ontologically necessary. Now Swinburne considers that the Trinity has the power to annihilate itself, although the necessary divine goodness renders such annihilation metaphysically impossible (p. I47). This power of self-destruction arises because each of the divine persons has the power to annihilate the others. If these powers were simultaneously exercised then there would be no God any more. By contrast, the speculation I provide is compatible with the claim that the continued existence of God is ontologically necessary. Again my speculation is compatible with interpreting necessity as ontological necessity in the further claims (I), (2) and (3) above. I am not sure how much it matters to Swinburne that the continued existence of God is not ontologically necessary, so this difference may not be significant. I note, however, that Clark criticises Swinburne for using metaphysical rather than ontological necessity in his account.4 My speculation will be not be subject to that criticism. Like Swinburne I shall assume that the Trinity comes about and that before it existed God was what I call the primordial God - a single isolated divine person. On my speculation God changes quite radically, undergoing fission. On Swinburne's speculation (pp. I 74-7) the primordial God brought into existence another divine person, and they jointly brought into existence a third. This happened because the primordial God, being good, recognised that a loving community was of greater value than a single person. Hence the community of three persons is metaphysically necessary because required by the goodness of the primordial God. That, I take it, is Swinburne's Social Trinitarianism. In answer to the question as to why Social Trinitarianism counts as Trinitarianism (not, as Clark charges, mere Tritheism), social trinitarians might say that God is to be characterized as the perfect being and that what is perfect is not any one of these three gods, glorious though they be, but the community of love which they constitute. I shall characterize Extreme Social Trinitarianism as the 4 All references to Clark are to KellyJames Clark, 'Trinity or Tritheism?', Religious Studies 32 (i 996), 463-476.</page><page sequence="4">284 PETER FORREST position whose only concession to monotheism is to identify God with the community of gods. Now I grant that extreme social trinitarians believe there is but one God. But they also believe in three gods. So they are, after all, tritheists. Extreme Social Trinitarianism is tritheistic. But Swinburne is not a tritheist, for he implicitly moderates Social Trinitarianism in two ways. One way is via his claim that God is a unity. The other is via the point that the three divine persons are 'gods' rather than gods - for they lack the sort of individuality that human persons have, and which characterized the gods of polytheistic religion. The one God is a unity in that it is impossible that any of the parts (i.e. the three divine persons) exist without the others existing. For instance, it is impossible that the First Person exist without the second, for the necessary goodness of the First Person requires the causation of the second. This contrasts with the way in which even in ideal human com munities some of the parts (i.e. human persons) could have existed without others. The second moderation of Social Trinitarianism is due to the important thesis that divine persons lack thisness. Here by a thisness I mean an unanalysable intrinsic property necessarily unique to the thing which has it. Swinburne contrasts divine thisnessless with his common sense thesis that human persons do have thisness. Or at least I take that to be common sense, but in order to do so I give it a gloss, namely that the doctrine of thisness is neutral between a nominalist and realist interpretation. On a realist inter pretation a thisness exists as a constituent of the person. On a nominalist interpretation to say that a person has thisness is to say no more than that a person is primitively a this, that is, an individual whose individuality does not derive from anything else. Taken in this neutral way the thesis that human persons have thisness follows from common sense intuitions. One such intuition concerns indiscernible but non-identical human persons. The in tuition is that this is an ontologically possible, although perhaps absurd, situation.5 Here, we should note, the intuition is not about metaphysical possibility. For we may well think that God's goodness would prevent such an absurdity. One of Swinburne's major contributions is to have pointed out that there are many non-divine things which lack thisness, notably regions of space time but also, probably, subatomic particles.6 Provided we do not think that being a person implies having thisness, it follows that there is nothing ad hoc in proposing that divine persons lack thisness. Having made the contrast between divine persons which lack thisness and human persons which have thisness, Swinburne then follows a long tradition which maintains that the divine persons are distinct because and only 5 Richard Swinburne, 'Thisness', Australasian Journal of Philosophy, 73 (I995), 389-400. See p. 396. 6 Richard Swinburne, 'Thisness'. See p. 394.</page><page sequence="5">MODERATING SOCIAL TRINITARIANISM 285 because they stand in different relations to each other.7 Hence the three persons derive their individuality from precisely that which makes them parts of the one God, while human communities are, partially at least, formed out of pre-existing individuals.8 Both the ways in which Swinburne moderates Social Trinitarianism re quire the lack of thisness by divine persons. This is obvious in the case of the divine persons' lack of full individuality, which prevents them being gods rather than 'gods'. And Swinburne argues for it in the case of the unity of God; for were there to be three divine persons, each with thisness, we might envisage the first divine person bringing into existence not the actual second divine person but one with a different thisness (p. I 76). Having a different thisness would not prevent exact similarity and the choice of one thisness rather than another is not constrained by goodness. So there could be no reason flowing from divine goodness for there being this rather than that second divine person. The thesis that human persons have thisness may well be common sense but it is nonetheless open to objection, and if it mattered for Swinburne's moderation of Social Trinitarianism I would explain in detail why I do not rely on it.9 But it does not matter. For what is required to moderate Social Trinitarianism is divine thisnessless not human thisness. For suppose neither human nor divine persons have thisness. Then we can still make the contrast. On the one hand, divine persons are individuals because of the relations between them, which relations are also such as make them form the one God. On the other hand, human persons are individuals because of their differing physical and mental properties together with their relations with persons who already exist. Both the contingency of the relations with others human persons and the importance of physical and properties show human beings to be far more separate from each other than the divine persons. A natural objection to Social Trinitarianism is that monotheism requires that there be just a single divine thing. My reply is that if we insist on counting divine things and put no restriction on what sort of thing we are considering, then any distinct attributes of God would be different divine things. So if God has an infinity of attributes there are infinitely many divine things. Now the thesis of divine simplicity, according to which there is no multiplicity of divine attributes, is not implied by monotheism. Hence we 7 At least prior to Creation. We need not discuss the question of whether the three divine persons are differently related to created things. 8 In view of the popularity of the thesis of the social construction of the self, I should note that what I am saying is quite uncontroversial. Children may in some sense be constructed by their relations with adults, and adults might get reconstructed by their relations with children, but quite clearly adults exist as persons before their children do. 9 Cutting a long story short, I grant that our common sense intuitions commit us to the thesis that a human person has a thisness, and I grant that common sense has some authority even on metaphysical issues but I say that this is a defeasible authority and, in this case, may well be defeated because there is no good account of how we could know of thisnesses.</page><page sequence="6">286 PETER FORREST must restrict what is taken to be a thing when we are counting divine things, with the expectation of getting the answer 'one'. I take the semi-technical use of 'ousia' in the Nicean creed to be a way of suitably interpreting the word 'thing' when counting divine things. And Swinburne's moderated Social Trinitarianism enables us to rely on the explication of 'ousia' to mean 'substance', where I define a substance as something which cannot exist apart from its components and such that the components cannot exist apart from it. This contrasts with a different sense of' substance' ('hypostasis' in contexts where hypostasis is contrasted with ousia), defined as that in which properties inhere. Social trinitarians, however, do not need to subscribe to the metaphysics presupposed by talk of properties inhering. For they may take it that we have a good enough grasp of the concept of a person and that this concept applies without mere equivocation to divine and human persons.10 So they can ignore talk of hypostases and use the formula 'three persons one ousia'. Swinburne interprets the Nicean Creed's talk of the begetting of the second and the procession of the third in causal terms. As Swinburne describes it (p. I 7'I) this requires that prior to this process there is a state in which the First Person is identical to the primordial God. The First Person ceases to be identical to God in bringing about the existence of the Second. Contrast this with my speculation in which the primordial God fissions into three persons. II. DESIDERATA FOR SOCIAL TRINITARIANISM Thus far I am merely expounding Swinburne's version of Social Trinitarianism, except that I have already argued that Swinburne's con troversial thesis of human thisness is a distraction, quite unnecessary for his project. I shall now list some desiderata not mentioned by Swinburne. In this section I consider those which Swinburne's own version of Social Trinitarianism in fact satisfy. In the next I shall argue that we need to meet further desiderata, and thus moderate Social Trinitarianism in ways which Swinburne does not. Some of the desiderata for Trinitarianism reflect my reluctance to reject the monotheism of Jews and Muslims. Others are based on what I take to be the tradition of Christian orthodoxy, expressed primarily by the Councils of Nicea and Constantinople, but also, to some extent, by the Athanasian Creed. Affective Monotheism The God of a quite unmoderated Social Trinitarianism is an It, not a He or a She. But why does it sound strange to refer to God as It? I submit that the religious attitude expressed in acts of worship requires for its object a personal 10 This is to bracket off the problems of how we talk about the divine. I assume the phrase 'without mere equivocation' covers both univocal and analogical accounts.</page><page sequence="7">MODERATING SOCIAL TRINITARIANISM 287 being. A preliminary characterization of this attitudes would be that of unconditional submission to the divine will ('Islam') leading to a kind of trust and love which it would not be proper to have in a mere human person. If Extreme Social Trinitarianism were correct it would be a mistake to worship God in this way. We would choose which of the three gods to worship, knowing that the others are not jealous. I take it, however, that Christians worship the one God, who is also worshipped by Jews, Muslims and others. We have therefore, the desideratum of Affective Monotheism. It states that there is but one object of worship, God, and it endorses the horror Jews and Muslims have at the thought that Christians might be worshipping three gods. Unity of Divine Will Although not itself a metaphysical thesis, Affective Monotheism presupposes Intellectual Monotheism. This is the thesis that the divine persons are not properly called gods because they are not distinct enough from each other. As it stands, that characterization is rather vague, but one version of it would be the thesis that the three persons necessarily agree. In this way we arrive at the thesis of the Unity of Divine Will. A further reason for believing in the Unity of the Divine Will is that we should be influenced by the characterization of God as a perfect being. Social trinitarians stress the perfection exemplified by a loving community, but there is a further, and apparently incompatible, perfection, namely that exemplified by a loving individual. If we modify Social Trinitarianism so as to ensure the Unity of the Divine Will we can argue that God has both perfections on the grounds that a community with a united will can behave towards others just as if it were a single individual. Given the Unity of Divine Will, the act of submission to the will of one divine person, expressed by worship, may reasonably be interpreted as submission to the will of God. So we have at least gone some way towards satisfying the desideratum of Affective Monotheism. Notice that there is a stronger thesis not available to social trinitarians, however moderate. It is that the three persons are distinct conscious beings but share the very same will and hence are a single agent. In that case the divine will would not merely be a unity formed out of the wills of the three persons but a unity in the stronger sense of not being analysable into component wills. Superficially this is no more incoherent than the mythical dog Cerberus's having three heads but one heart. Rather the problem is that it would destroy the important positive teaching of Social Trinitarianism that the Trinity exemplifies the perfection of a loving community. For, I take it, a perfect loving community must be one in which there are distinct wills, even if they are in harmony. I submit, then, that Social Trinitarianism should be moderated so that we</page><page sequence="8">288 PETER FORREST say the three divine persons necessarily agree on all things. Swinburne argues that this occurs because the first person in bringing the others into existence, delegates powers in such a way as to prevent even the disagreement that can occur among those who love each other and seek only what is good. If an example of such disagreement is required, consider the predicament of a couple one of whom wants to spend the afternoon at the beach and the other wants to spend it in the Botanical Gardens. Neither dislikes what the other prefers. If they are inclined to be unselfish and do what the other wants they would havejust as much trouble agreeing as if they are inclined to be selfish." Worshipping Christ A further desideratum is that, without abandoning Affective Monotheism, Christians may properly worship Christ and properly venerate Mary as Mother of God (theotokos). This desideratum can be thought of as the affective version of the Athanasian Creed's claim that each of the three distinct persons is not merely a necessary component of God but is identical to God. For if the second divine person is identical to God then in worshipping Christ we are worshipping God. Here I note that my formulation of the Unity of Divine Will allows for the worship of Christ. For I have allowed that there are three divine wills and each is an object of religious attitudes. Qualitative Difference The Unity of Divine Wills thesis might suffice tojustify Affective Monotheism but we need more to avoid the charge of Tritheism. We need what I call Qualitative Difference, which is one of the ways Swinburne moderates Social Trinitarianism. This states that there is a difference between the Trinity and a pantheon of gods, even if the gods necessarily agree. I would suggest that Qualitative Difference is satisfied because the relations which distinguish the three divine persons are precisely those which make them the constituents of God. By contrast, in a pantheon of gods, either every god is independent of the others and so a substance in the sense of' ousia', or else they are arranged in a hierarchy of dependence. So Qualitative Difference would not be satisfied on a version of the Trinity in which the First Person caused the other persons to exist in a way which was neither ontologically nor metaphysically necessary. III. FURTHER MODERATION Thus far I have been deliberately ignored five desiderata for Moderate Social Trinitarianism which are not satisfied by Swinburne's speculations. One of "' I am indebted to Phillip Pettit for pointing out that not all coordination problems can be overcome by unselfishness.</page><page sequence="9">MODERATING SOCIAL TRINITARIANISM 289 these is that the first cause of all other things should be the one who is now worshipped as God and not, as in Swinburne's account, a single divine person who was once the whole of God. My chief reason for proposing this as a desideratum is respect for such monotheistic traditions asJudaism and Islam, who would insist that there is just one God which is the cause of all things. I shall satisfy this desideratum by speculating that the primordial God undergoes a fission into the three divine persons. For that ensures the identity of the primordial God with the God who is the Trinity. As far as I can see Swinburne cannot modify his speculation to satisfy this desideratum. The second desideratum is that, as Clark urges, our account of the Trinity should be compatible with the ontological necessity of the continued exist ence of God. We should not be committed to the somewhat startling thesis that God has the power of self-destruction. It is not easy to combine this desideratum with the attractive idea that the divine persons express their love by giving each other continued existence. As far as I can see Swinburne could adapt his account to satisfy this desideratum in much the way that I shall, that is by attributing to each divine person the power either to continue their own existence or to confer existence on another. In that way if, of metaphysical impossibility, a war broke out in the Trinity the last divine person left would be God. The third desideratum is based on Clark's objection that metaphysical necessity is just too weak for the sort of necessity which theologians have had in mind when discussing the existence and nature of God. Now both the unity of God as a substance, in the sense of 'ousia', and the unity of the divine wills is explicated in terms of the necessity of the relations between the persons. Necessarily the first person brings into existence the second, necess arily the first two (or on the Eastern Orthodox view the first) bring into existence the third. Necessarily they agree because, according to Swinburne, necessarily there is a wise delegation of powers. This necessity is, on his speculation, a metaphysical but not an ontological necessity. The third desideratum is that the necessity by which the divine persons are one 'ousia' should be ontological necessity. The argument for this is partly respect for the tradition, but partly that, on intuitive grounds, the parts which constitute a single thing will only do so if it is beyond even divine power to split them. The fourth desideratum is that the divine wills should be united in the further sense that the divine persons necessarily have the same desires. This is not the same as there being a wise delegation of powers within the Trinity. (Imagine a culture in which men have power over their sons' education and women over their daughters'. Parents could still disagree about how they want their children educated.) I argue for this fourth desideratum by returning to Affective Monotheism. If the harmony of the wills of the three divine persons is merely a consequence of a delegation of powers then you could knowingly submit yourself to the will of the second person without</page><page sequence="10">290 PETER FORREST submitting yourself to the will of the first.12 Or, more plausibly, you could lovingly submit your will to the Second Person but only grudgingly and resentfully to the First. I say that the submission to the will of the one God, required by affective monotheism, requires there to be a necessary harmony of the divine wills. Only then is it absurd knowingly to submit to the will of one but not the other. I am not sure just what sort of necessity is required here, but my conjecture, for what it is worth, is that the harmony should be due to divine goodness, not to any lack of power to disagree. For lack of the power to disagree among members of the Trinity would seem incompatible with it being a perfect community. I reject on the above grounds Swinburne's account of how the divine wills are united. In any case, I think his account is unnecessarily complicated. For although not all coordination problems are solved by love, those in finite communities of more than two are. We may assume that provided the outcome is good the chief desire of each of the three divine persons is to please the others.13 Hence for any two-way decision all three necessarily desire that the majority will prevail, and unlike in human democracies the majority's will then becomes the ungrudging will of all. Swinburne considers this (p. I 74) but then rejects it because of the possibility of decisions with more than two alternatives. Let us suppose, then, that the three divine persons make initially different choices. If we- think of it anthropomorphically, each will then desire to defer to one of the others. Of the eight ways of thus deferring six result in a choice by two that the third's will be deferred to. So there is a 75 0 chance of reaching agreement at each attempt. Assuming there are infinitely many opportunities for the divine persons to try to reach agree ment, then the possibility of never doing so has infinitesimal probability. 14 Perhaps this is just too anthropomorphic but it shows that the final desideratum can be satisfied on any version of Social Trinitarianism. Per sonally I would prefer to speculate that joint action as a result of joint intentions is really no more mysterious than the action of a single individual, so we do not need such anthropomorphic models. It suffices to point out the three persons would judge it better to act jointly than individually and hence do act jointly. 12 Clearly you can unknowingly submit yourself to the 'will of X' but not 'the will of Y' where X and Y are identical. For instance you could submit yourself to the will of Allah but not to the triune God, not knowing that they are the same. My remarks concern, however, someone who knows all there is for us to know about the persons of the Trinity. 13 There is a threat of regress. For example suppose X desires to please Y and Y desires to please Z who desires to please X and so on. Then it might seem that X is motivated to do what Y wants and hence to do what Z wants and hence to do what X wants, and hence to do what Y wants etc. I avoid the regress by submitting that the motive of love is to seek something definite which the beloved already desires. Thus if you do not yet love newly acquired stepchildren whom your spouse loves, love of your spouse would motivate doing specific things for your stepchildren that your spouse desires to occur. By itself love for your spouse would not motivate doing specific things they want about which your spouse is neutral. 14 Bartel, like me, rejects Swinburne's solution to the problem. His own solution which he considers cannot be guaranteed to succeed depends on Middle Knowledge. See T. W. Bartel, "Could There Be More Than One Almighty?', Religious Studies 29 (I993), 465-495.</page><page sequence="11">MODERATING SOCIAL TRINITARIANISM 29I Finally, there is the desideratum that we respect the Athanasian Creed's statement that each person is God. Perhaps I should add to this the state ment, which has the authority of, for instance, the Council of I42I-I445, that the divine persons have no beginning. We are left, then, with three further desiderata which Swinburne's account does not satisfy - and cannot easily be modified in order to satisfy - namely: (I) that the ultimate cause of all things be God not just the First Person; (2) that, as Clark has stressed, the necessity by which the divine persons are united is more than mere metaphysical necessity; and (3) that we should give some respect to the claim that each person is God and is without beginning. In the next section I develop a speculation satisfying these de siderata. IV. SOME CONSEQUENCES OF DIVINE THISNESSLESS I shall now argue that divine thisnessless implies that the divine persons are quasi-individuals not individuals and that this permits divine fission. First, I claim that nothing lacking in thisness is an individual unless it derives its individuality from something with thisness. The primordial God does not have such derived individuality. So the primordial God is not an individual but what I shall call a quasi-individual. I further claim that quasi-individuals can survive fission. Here I note, only to dismiss, the objection that as a matter of conceptual analysis persons must be individuals. I dismiss this because should that be the case it merely shows that the primordial God, although a personal being, was not a person but rather a quasi-person. And that is of no consequence. Nor would it be of much consequence if it should turn out that, even now, the Persons of the Trinity are strictly speaking quasi-persons because they are not individuals in the strict sense. Indeed that might strike some as a welcome further moderation of Social Trinitarianism. If Xs are genuine individuals there will, ignoring vagueness, be a unique though perhaps infinite answer to the question 'How many Xs are there?' What I mean by a quasi-individual is that if Xs are quasi-individuals the question 'How many Xs are there?' has a unique least correct answer but no unique correct answer. For example, 'three', 'six', 'nine' etc. might all be correct answers to the question, in which case 'three' is the unique least correct answer. The obvious convention for counting quasi-individuals is to speak as if the Identity of Indiscernibles held and so give the least correct answer, in this case 'three'. I shall be arguing that the primordial God is a quasi-individual and so the question 'How many divine persons are there?' had in the primordial situation any positive whole number as its answer. Therefore, the least correct, and hence conventional answer would have been one'. My claim is that to be an individual rather than a quasi-individual</page><page sequence="12">292 PETER FORREST something must either have thisness or derive its individuality by being related to something with thisness in such a way that only one thing could be so related. Suppose Swinburne is correct in claiming that some created things such as human persons have thisness. And suppose joint causation is impossible so only one divine person could create a given item. Then any divine person which created something with thisness would thereby become an individual and so, I say, incapable of further fission. But prior to creation it would seem that the divine persons are quasi-individuals and their number is not so much three as three-or-any-multiple. I argue for this by exploiting the well-known connection between thisness and the principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles. I shall first state the argument in the context of the debate over that principle, and then isolate it. First, then, I note that Adams has argued that because the Identity of Indiscernibles fails then there must be things with thisness.15 To do this he presents a variant on Black's argument that the Identity of Indiscernibles fails because there are possible symmetrical worlds.'6 We could, for instance, consider a world with nothing in it but two qualitatively identical spheres. Because of the symmetry there is nothing to make one sphere this and the other that except, the argument goes, their thisnesses. And that seems correct, provided we are neutral between a realist and a nominalist interpretation of thisness. The weak link in the argument is the assumption that there is a possible world which may only be described as consisting of nothing but two qualitatively identical spheres. That assumption has a certain initial plausi bility because we are reluctant to multiply necessities and the only alternative to it initially seems to be that necessarily there cannot be a world describable as consisting of nothing but two qualitatively identical spheres. At this point we should, however, recall Hacking's interpretation of the Identity of Indiscernibles, namely that any possible world may be described as without two indiscernible things."7 So, in the case of the two spheres example, Hacking would say that there is indeed a world which may be described as two spheres which exactly resemble each other, but that this same world may also be described as just a single sphere. I think Hacking is right about the alternative to believing in thisness. Nothing as strong as the impossibility of two or more qualitatively identical things should follow from the mere lack of thisness. Rather if there is no thisness then there is no fact of the matter as to whether we describe the possible world as consisting of one sphere or two qualitatively identical spheres. Hence the spheres are quasi-individuals. We may with perfect correctness describe the situation as one with two, or three or more spheres but the minimum number of spheres in a correct description is one. 15 See Robert M. Adams 'Primitive Thisness and Primitive Identity', journal of Philosophy 76 (I979), 5-26. 16 Max Black, 'The Identity of Indiscernibles', Mind, 6i (I952), I53-I64. 17 Ian Hacking, 'The Identity of Indiscernibles', journal of Philosophy 72 (I 975), 249-256.</page><page sequence="13">MODERATING SOCIAL TRINITARIANISM 293 Isolating the argument, it goes like this. First I invite you to consider items which lack thisness and which are not individuated by other things which have thisness. Then I submit that there is no difference between saying there is just one of them or saying there are many of them which are exactly resemble each other. And that, by definition, is to say they are quasi individuals. To this you might well reply that it is not even possible for there to be several items which exactly resemble each other. I have two rejoinders to this. The first that this reply multiplies necessities more than is necessary. Necessities are, I say, significant facts about the way things are which should not be made true simply by a lack of thisness. My other rejoinder is to rely upon Adams' Continuity Argument.18 Adams, having already rejected Hacking's position, argues against the im possibility of two indiscernible things by noting that there could be things which were discernible in some minute and trivial fashion. Thus, in his example, a quickly forgotten detail of a nightmare is all that might distinguish someone from an otherwise exact replica. Then he relies upon the intuition, which I share, that such minutiae should not affect the issue. I do not, however, take this as an argument for thisness, but rather as showing that where things lack thisness there is no fact of the matter as to whether they are one or many. I grant that the above argument is just the sort of thing that brings metaphysics into disrepute. How could anyone know, readers might protest, about such matters? How can I be so confident about the principle that necessities are not to be multiplied more than is necessary? And why should we trust an intuition that the difference between the possibility and impossi bility of replicas should not depend on some minute difference? I grant that all this is speculative. But in order to defend a moderate Social Trinitarianism it suffices to provide a speculative metaphysics which is no worse than its rivals. At very least, then, we may speculate that items lacking thisness are quasi-individuals unless they derive individuality from items with thisness. I now argue that quasi-individuals can survive fission.'9 Let us consider again the universe which can be described either as consisting of one sphere or as two (or more) indiscernible spheres. Perhaps this sphere/these spheres are subject to rare and random deformation. There is a chance that a sphere will become a cube. If we describe the universe as two spheres then there is a chance of one of them becoming a cube. In that the case the 'one' sphere has undergone fission into a sphere and a cube. More accurately the mini mum answer to the question 'How many solid objects are there?' has 18 Adams, 'Primitive Thisness and Primitive Identity', p. I7. 19 Here I am indebted to David Lewis' defence of the possibility of fission. See 'Survival and Identity' in A. 0. Rorty (ed.) The Identities of Persons (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), pp. I7-40, reprinted in David Lewis, Philosophical Papers, Vol. I (Oxford: Oxford University Press, I983), pp. 55-73, with postscript (pp. 73-77). I take Lewis to be claiming that even we human beings are quasi-individuals.</page><page sequence="14">294 PETER FORREST increased from one to two. The reason why the object survives such fission is that the situation can truly be described as one in which there were always two objects one of which changed. Likewise on the assumption that the primordial God lacks thisness there is the possibility of fission into three divine persons. I see no reason, however, to suppose such fission to be beyond the power of the primordial God to control. Eventually either Creation or the Incarnation might confer individuality on the divine persons, but prior to Creation the divine persons are still quasi individuals. Hence it is only the asymmetry of some of the relations between them which prevents the conventional number of divine persons being one. So if these asymmetrical relations are few, we can say that it is almost the case that the conventional numbering is one. This might help to further moderate Social Trinitarianism. The above provides a speculative account of how it is possible for divine persons to be individuated by their relations only: it is possible because they are quasi-individuals and the asymmetry of certain relations merely serves to exclude some of the ways of counting them, leaving only those in which there are a multiple of three. Had the relations been symmetric then there would have been all ways of counting so the conventional number of divine persons would be one. I have speculated that the primordial one-person God fissions into a Trinity for the sake of there being community. To provide further details of how this fission occurs, we may suppose some power of self-limitation in the three (or more) indistinguishable quasi-individuals who are the primordial God. Hence the three persons who are symmetrically related (and hence conventionally counted as one person) can choose to lose half of some of the symmetrical relation. Interestingly, since God then becomes the Trinity this does not require that God ceases to be omnipotent.20 The self-limitation merely concerns the three persons who become distinct - distinct in the sense that their minimum number is now three - by limiting their powers. But what relations shall we consider? Social trinitarians should not follow Augustine and Aquinas in considering the relations of love and knowledge. For these must surely hold symmetrically between the persons of a perfect community. Now, although there is more to loving than giving and receiving, giving is the typical and appropriate expression of love. I speculate, then, that we may take the relations distinguishing the persons of the Trinity as ones in which some gift is given or shared. My speculation is that the gift is one of continued existence and hence the continuance of the joy of being a divine person. The Second Person's existence is a gift from the First and the 20 Omnipotence is notoriously hard to define, but I take divine omnipotence to be quite neutral on the topic of power to alter the divine composition. Omnipotence concerns power over things other than God.</page><page sequence="15">MODERATING SOCIAL TRINITARIANISM 295 Third's a gift from the first two. I would further speculate that the three divine persons are faced with a choice of either exercising a power of continued existence or, laying down that power, conferring continued exist ence on other divine persons. It might go like this. The First Person has the power to continue the Second's existence, and they could both continue in existence of their own power, but they have to lay down this power in bringing the Third into existence, and the Third could then exist without the others but lays down this power in order to ensure the continued existence of the First. Clearly there are many variants on this speculation. But the basic idea is that the fission of the primordial God results from a voluntary diminution of the powers of the three initially indiscernible persons so that they become a genuine community in which each person expresses love for the others. It might be objected that love is a sham if you can rely, with rational certainty, on others reciprocating. A loving community, it might be suggested, is one with genuine vulnerability where everyone trusts each other but does so without rational certainty. To this my reply is that the vulner ability implicit in loving relations is that of trust where the one trusted is free not to reciprocate. A perfectly loving community is one in which the indi viduals can be relied upon with full confidence freely to choose to reciprocate. The disposition to trust others without rational certainty if the circumstances should arise is, however, required for the perfection of being a totally loving person. God has that perfection but it only gets manifested in the Incar nation, which is not my present topic. If you ask when the fission of the primordial God occurred I would reply that there is, on the one hand, an ordered sequence A of acts by human and divine agents and, on the other, a dimension of time T (more accurately space-time) which is part of and dependent on this universe which is created by God in one of the acts in A. Now the human and perhaps some of the divine acts in A are correlated with moments in T.21 So if we ask when the Trinity came into being we may reply in two ways. There is no moment in T at which either it or the creation of this universe occurred, but in the sequence of acts A the formation of the Trinity was, presumably, the very first act. It preceded the act of creation which in turn preceded any of the acts correlated with moments of T. Notice also the difficulty in providing a speculation in which the primor dial God splits into a Binity. For in that case we could only distinguish the two persons by assuming that one (the First) retains the power to continue to exist while the other (the Second) does not. But then there is no gift of love from the Second to the First. 21 For details of this correlation see Peter Forrest, 'Physical Necessity and the Passage of Time', in PeterJ. Riggs (ed.), Natural Kinds, Laws of Nature and Scientific Methodology (Dordrecht: Kluwer, I996), pp. 49-62.</page><page sequence="16">296 PETER FORREST I have sketched a Swinburne-inspired account of the Trinity as a com munity of love arising from, and being explained by the existence of a primordial God who is not a Trinity. Following Swinburne I relied heavily on divine thisnessless, but, unlike him, I have not relied on human thisness. It remains to show how the various desiderata are satisfied, especially those which Swinburne's own account did not satisfy. First, I note that the existence of the divine persons as distinct depends on the differing relations between them. Because they are quasi-individuals, if they remained in existence but did not have these differing relations, they would undergo fusion. That is, the minimum number they could be assigned would drop from three to one. The necessity by which this is so is the necessity of divine thisnessless, which I take to be ontological necessity. It is also worth considering what would happen if, say, the First Person failed to confer existence on the Second. Then the Trinity would collapse into a unitarian God, but by the extinction of the other persons rather than by fusion. All this is compatible with the ontological impossibility of God ceasing to exist. For, whether there is fusion or the survival ofjust one person, in either case God still exists. Because of the ontological necessity of the dependence of the divine persons on the relations between them, they constitute a single 'ousia' which satisfies the desideratum of Intellectual Monotheism, and does so in a way which meets Clark's objection that we should be considering ontological rather than metaphysical necessity. Finally, let us consider the Athanasian Creed used by Clark (p. 472) as an objection to Swinburne's position. Here I agree with Clark. For even given appropriate freedom of interpretation the claim that each of the three divine persons is God should not be taken as merely predicating divinity of them. Rather it means that each divine person is in some sense the whole of God. I shall exhibit two senses in which my speculation identifies each divine person with the whole of God. I leave it to readers to decide whether these satisfy the spirit of the Athanasian Creed. I also note that we will be able to say that in some fashion the divine persons have no beginning. For each person is in some sense identical to the primordial God. The first sense in which each of the three divine persons is identical to the whole of God is a loose sense of identity over time. If we think of a person as consisting of stages related in a suitable way, then we loosely refer to the relation between stages as identity. In that loose sense, if a person undergoes fission it is often said that the pre-fission stage is identical to each of the post fission stages. The phrase 'is identical to' in this loose sense seems to mean 'is a part of the same temporally extended person as'. In that sense we may indeed say that the one primordial God is 'identical to' each of the three divine persons, and hence the divine persons are without beginning in whatever way the primordial God is without beginning.</page><page sequence="17">MODERATING SOCIAL TRINITARIANISM 297 The other sense concerns not 'identity' over time, but counterfactual identity. Here we may say that each divine person is the whole of God meaning that were the others to cease to exist then what is left would be God without any loss of power or knowledge. On my speculation that does indeed hold, and holds of ontological necessity22. 22 I would like to thank both the anonymous referee and Peter Byrne for their helpful advice.</page></plain_text>
