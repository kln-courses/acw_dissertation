<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Peculiarities of Mexican History: Mexico Compared to Latin America, I821-1992 ALAN KNIGHT This is a piece of comparative history, not an exercise in folkloric whimsy. It does not attempt to probe the secrets of lo mexicano, la mexicanidad, or any of the other quasi-metaphysical concepts which litter the field of Mexican cultural history.1 Nor does it pay too much attention to those more positivistic analyses which try to encapsulate Mexican (political) culture in terms of statistical comparisons.2 Rather, it offers some comparative generalisations about Mexican history in the national period, stressing both broad patterns of socio-economic development and specific politico-cultural factors. Thus -for better or worse -its model is Barrington Moore rather than, say, Octavio Paz or Gabriel Almond. It also draws inspiration - and borrows its title - from the work of E. P. Thompson, which in turn has been developed by Eley and Blackbourn in the German context, Corrigan and Sayer in the English.3 Its purpose is to offer some explanations of the distinctiveness (as well as the commonality) of Mexico's history, compared to the history of Latin America, in the national period.4 See Octavio Paz, The Labyrinth of Solitude: Life and Thought in Mexico (New York, I961) and the same author's The Other Mexico: Critique of the Pyramid (New York, I972); Samuel Ramos, Profile of Man and Culture in Mexico (Austin, I962). That these elusive concepts - delivered, in the case of Octavio Paz, of course, with considerable panache - can ensnare even an acute journalistic mind is shown in Alan Riding, Distant Neighbors: A Portrait of the Mexicans (New York, I984), ch.

In the last fifty years, Mexico has experienced relatively rapid economic growth coupled with relative political and social stability.5 The achievements of the 'stabilised development' of the I950 and I96os are well known: a solid regime, rapid growth rates, low inflation, rising per capita income.6 And, while the i98os were a decade of relative stagnation, Mexico's relative position within Latin America has not deteriorated.7 Furthermore, the prospects for future development - of a capitalist kind, with all that that entails - look better now than they did in the late i98os; all the more if the Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.A. is concluded, as now seems probable. Compare this to the experience of Brazil, Argentina, or Peru. Meanwhile, even more clearly, Mexico has enjoyed relative stability - '60 years of social peace' as the placards of the PRI proclaimed in 1989 - compared to the rest of Latin America. Possessed of a distinctive, one-party regime, which combines authoritarianism with relative freedom of expression, Mexico has avoided the extremes of bureaucratic authoritarianism and praetorian rule;8 its guerra sucia was minor skirmishing compared to the barbarities of the southern cone versions; it has not engaged in systematic ethnocide, as in Guatemala;9 and it faces no sustained rural insurrection, such as Peru's ('como Mexico no hay dos!'), I will, in passing, note comparisons - as well as contrasts- between Mexico's pattern of development and that of other Latin American countries. 5 'Stability' begs a host of questions. Mexico has been politically stable in the sense of avoiding both frequent ministerial reshuffles (compare the French Fourth Republic) and, more significantly, major regime changes (compare Argentina since the I940s). By 'social stability' I mean not social stasis (Mexican society has changed markedly since 1940) but a (relative) absence of major social conflict - such as affected the country prior to I940, and most dramatically during I910-20. 6 Roger D. Hansen, The Politics of Mexican Development (Baltimore, I97I), ch. 3. 7 Recent annual growth rates (GDP, I989-9I) have averaged +4.1% for Mexico compared to -o.6 % for both Argentina and Brazil: New York Times, 3 Nov. I991, p. i. (Figures taken from the Inter-American Development Bank and the United Nations Economic Commission on Latin America: I991 figures are estimates based on the first semester.) 8 Mexico's place within the bureaucratic-authoritarian spectrum is not clear; at best, it is admitted to the category with major caveats; certainly it is not a paradigmatic case. See Guillermo O'Donnell, 'Corporatism and the Question of the State', in James M. Malloy (ed.), Authoritarianism and Corporatism in Latin America (Pittsburgh, 1977), pp. 53 and 80, and the same author's 'Introduction to Latin American Cases', in Guillermo O'Donnell, Philippe C. Schmitter and Laurence Whitehead (eds.), Transitions From Authoritarian Rule: Latin America (Baltimore, 1986), pp. 5-6. 9 While Chiapas has had its share of repression and violence, the picture is more nuanced than that of Guatemala, across the border; the Federal government seeks to control and co-opt, but in doing so it concedes some space for peasant (including Indian) mobilisation, which has tended to increase in recent years: see Neil Harvey, 'Peasant Strategies and Corporatism in Chiapas', in Joe Foweraker and Ann L. Craig, Popular Movements and Political Change in Mexico (Boulder, 1990), pp. I93-8.</page><page sequence="3">Mexico, 1821-1992 oI Sendero Luminoso or El Salvador's FMLN.10 In short, its government has, despite serious economic problems and political challenges, retained a measure of control, at least partially based on legitimacy, which most Latin American governments would envy. The military has remained in barracks (despite some scares, as in 1976)11 and presidential successions have been smooth. This is not to deny the shock of the 1988 presidential election, recurrent electoral confrontations and 'alchemy', vigorous 'new social movements', and much talk of the delegitimisation of the entire system.12 Arguably, the system was never wholly legitimate and the 'new' social movements, while undoubtedly numerous and significant, may not be as new and significant as often supposed.13 Thus what we are witnessing in contemporary Mexico may be less a historic fall from grace than a particular phase in a protracted cycle of social and political change. This is not Lucifer being cast out of heaven but another twist in a long historical tale, which has had its fair share of vicissitudes in the past - vicissitudes which the regime has survived. Any grasp of the Mexican present therefore requires both an understanding of the past and the contextualisation of that past within a broader comparative framework. History may not afford facile lessons; but it may provide cautionary tales, antidotes to 'immediatist' enthusiasms.'4 Democratisation, for example, may be all the rage, from Sofia to Santiago; but, even if such global trends are evident, they mean different things in different places and, in some places, they may mean very little. Mexico's recent record is all the more remarkable if we consider the first two generations after independence ( 82 1-76). Then, Mexico was the sick man of Spanish America, a victim of febrile instability, pernicious financial anaemia, and a major amputation. Between I821 and 1871 Mexico was governed and misgoverned by some forty-five administrations. Govern- ment expenditures outstripped income, credit atrophied, and debts accumulated, leaving the regime vulnerable to domestic agiotistas and 10 The guerrilla movements of the '1960s and 1970s, concentrated in the state of Guerrero, were not of the same order: see Baloy Mayo, La guerrilla de Genaroy Lucio, analisisy resultados (Mexico, i980). 1 Soledad Loaeza, 'La politica del rumor: Mexico noviembre-diciembre de I976', in Soledad Loaeza, El llamado de las urnas (Mexico, 1989), pp. 123-5. 12 For a lively discussion of Mexican politics in the election year of 1988 see Wayne A.

Instability hampered trade and industry; Mexico lacked adequate communications (the first major railway concession, for a line linking Mexico City and Veracruz, was signed in I837, but not completed until i873);16 and entrepreneurs had to reckon with a highly politicised political economy, in which contacts and clientelism inhibited the 'rational' pursuit of profit.17 Compared to the other major Latin American countries, not to mention the U.S.A., Mexico experienced slow growth.18 A key factor, obviously, was Mexico's lack of a dynamic stable export, comparable to Brazilian coffee, Argentinian wool, even Peruvian guano or Ecuadorian cacao. In political terms, too, the stability of Brazil under the Empire, of Chile under Portales, com- pared favourably to Mexico's 'marathon of violence'.19 Not surprisingly, Mexican ideologues began to look wistfully at the stability and progress of the southern cone, especially oligarchic Argentina.20 Under Porfirio Diaz (I876--I9I), their hopes seemed to be fulfilled. Mexico's vicious circle of political instability and economic stagnation gave way to a virtuous circle of 'order and progress'. Now, Mexico experienced a phase of relatively oligarchic rule, during which an infrastructure was established, exports boomed, and the economy (including infant industries) grew and diversified.21 Cities expanded and acquired new amenities; the middle class burgeoned; an industrial working class was born and, with it, awareness of an emergent 'social question'.22 None of this was unique, of course.

Oligarchic rule ended, not according to the decorous reformism of the Saenz Pefia law,26 but amid social upheaval, peasant insurrection, and civil war. A middle class bid for political representation ushered in, not controlled reform, but chaotic revolution. The ostensibly strong Porfirian state crumbled and, for a time, Mexico became a mosaic of revolutionary - and counter-revolutionary - fiefs. The economy slumped, the peso collapsed, population fell.27 Yet, out of this traumatic experience there emerged, in (DeKalb, 1976), pp. 12- 3; Moises Gonzalez Navarro, Historia Moderna de Mexico: El Porfiriato: la vida social (Mexico, 1970), pp. 807-I .

As recent studies stress, the Mexican Revolution displayed a distinctly Tocquevillean character: from the rubble of revolution was built a state both stronger and more stable than its old regime counterpart.28 No less important - though rather less studied - the Revolution encouraged socio-economic changes (many of them unplanned and unforeseen) which made possible both the political resilience and the economic dynamism of the postrevolutionary era.29 While the Revolution was crucial in determining this outcome, in turning a sick man into a vigorous survivor, it would be wrong to derive Mexico's entire twentieth-century experience from revolutionary origins. First, because the Revolution - as we all recognise - was a multifaceted and often contradictory phenomenon: its 'outcome' was the result of a complex dialectical process, which involved the defeat of some 'revolutionary' elements and aspirations, the triumph of others. In other words, the Revolution contained the seeds of different outcomes; while some stood a better chance of germinating than others, the process of growth depended upon a host of factors, some of them contingent and external to Mexico. Indeed, it may be rash to assume that the Revolution's genetic stock has been entirely exhausted. Second, within the sweep of Mexican history, the Revolution cannot be construed as a sudden, exogenous causal factor (analogous to the putative asteroid which, falling to earth, ended the era of the dinosaurs). Rather, the Revolution embodied and, in turn, recast certain established themes in Mexican history. It was both product and producer of that history - as its protagonists, regularly invoking the past, were well aware.30 To understand the peculiarities of Mexican history in the twentieth century we must focus squarely on the Revolution, but we must locate the Revolution within its broader context. This I shall do, briefly and sketchily, by looking at two main themes which feed into the Revolution: first, popular insurgency and resistance, which demand an analysis of class structure and economic development (an essentially materialist analysis); and second, political ideology and culture, specifically the questions of 28 John Womack Jr., 'The Mexican Revolution, I9I0-I920' and Jean Meyer, 'Mexico: Revolution and Reconstruction in the I92os', in Leslie Bethell (ed.), The Cambridge History of Latin America, vol. 5 (Cambridge, I986), pp. 153 and 193. 29 Knight, Mexican Revolution, vol. z, pp. 5I7-27. 30 As Arnaldo C6rdova observes, 'in Mexico the Revolution was born along with a burning defence of the past', in which respect it contrasted with the French or Russian Revolutions (La ideologia de la Revolucidn Mexicana [Mexico, I988, first pubd. 1973], p. 87).

The supposition that the Mexicans have been a turbulent people - un pueblo levantisco - has recently received statistical support. According to John Coatsworth, Mexico witnessed a disproportionate number of popular uprisings during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.31 Over time, of course, the nature of such uprisings changed. First, a relatively somnolent seventeenth century- characterised, if not by 'depression', then at least by relative economic torpor, and by the mediating rule of paternalist officials and clerics - gave way, during the eighteenth century, to economic expansion and Bourbon reformism (a transition by no means peculiar to Mexico, of course).32 Since these trends conspired with population growth, the pressure on Mexico's subordinate classes, especially the rural poor and peasantry, substantially increased. 'De- compression', in Tutino's terminology, gave way to 'compression', especially in the economic pacemaker of the colony, the Bajio and Guadalajara regions.33 The result was a marked upswing in rural protest, which has been expertly analysed by William Taylor.34 When conjugated with poor harvests, Malthusian crises, and political instability, these factors produced the massive popular insurrection of i8io. Thus, in contrast to Argentina or Chile, Mexico's bid for independence began as a popular movement, directed against landlords, officials and gachupines, 31 John Coatsworth, 'Patterns of Rural Rebellion in Latin America: Mexico in Comparative Perspective', in Friedrich Katz (ed.), Riot, Rebellion and Revolution: Social Conflict in Mexico (Princeton, I988), pp. 2I-62. Even if this were a false stereotype (which I doubt), it would contrast, for example, with the 'official' view of the Brazilian povo as 'passive, uncomplaining [and] in need of motivation': Robert M. Levine, 'Elite Perspectives on the Povo', in Michael L. Conniff and Frank D. McCann (eds.), Modern Brazil, Elites and Masses in Historical Perspective (Lincoln, i989), p. 220. It is worth noting, however, that the rebellious Mexicans were overwhelmingly rural: during the I8Io insurgency the cities were relatively inert; while, a century later, during the Revolution, riots tended to concentrate in the declining artisanal towns of the Bajio and the major metropolises remained tranquil (Knight, Mexican Revolution, vol. I, pp. 208- 5). 32 John Tutino, From Insurrection to Revolution in Mexico: Social Bases of Agrarian Violence, r770-I940 (Princeton, I986), ch. 2; for comparisons with Peru, see Hans-Jurgen Puhle and Nils Jacobsen (eds.), The Economies of Mexico and Peru During the Late Colonial Period, 1760-i8io (Berlin, I986). 33 Tutino, From Insurrection, chs. 2-5; Eric Van Young, Hacienda and Market in Eighteenth- Century Mexico: The Rural Economy of the Guadalajara Region, i67-r1820 (Berkeley, I98i); and the same author's 'Moving Towards Revolt: Agrarian Origins of the Hidalgo Rebellion in the Guadalajara Region', in Katz (ed.), Riot, Rebellion and Revolution, pp. 176-204. 34 William Taylor, Drinking, Homicide and Rebellion in Colonial Mexico (Stanford, 1979), ch. 4, and the same author's 'Banditry and Insurrection: Rural Unrest in Central Jalisco, 1790-I816', in Katz (ed.), Riot, Rebellion and Revolution, pp. 205-46.</page><page sequence="8">io6 Alan Knight infused with radical and occasionally messianic ideas.35 In Mexico, as in Peru in the 1780s, popular insurgency scared the creole well-to-do into submission and enabled the Spaniards to retain colonial control. While the non-peasant periphery of the continent broke away from Spain, the peasant heartlands (Middle America and the Andes) remained loyal, until they were either liberated from without (in the case of Peru) or hijacked by conservative creole elites, as in the case of Mexico.36 The Napoleonic Wars, the ravages of the insurgency, and the expulsion of the Spaniards, helped to depress the Mexican economy. To that extent, the pressure on the peasantry eased: the ruined and undercultivated haciendas which dotted the early nineteenth-century countryside bespoke a rural economy lacking demand, above all lacking a powerful export demand.37 Landlords had fewer incentives to dispossess peasants; the peasants, it is even suggested, embarked on popular offensives in order to expand their holdings.38 True, the collapse of the colony removed what was left of paternalist mediation between peasants and elites; and some elites - such as the landlords of Chalco - sought to compensate for their parlous economic circumstances by squeezing the local peasantry (a somewhat 'Andean' phenomenon).39 In the Indian periphery, too, the 35 Brian Hamnett, The Roots of Insurgency: Mexican Regions, 17J0-I824 (Cambridge, I986); Eric Van Young, 'Millennium on the Northern Marches: the Mad Messiah of Durango and Popular Rebellion in Mexico, 8oo-I8I15 ', Comparative Studies in Society and History, vol. 28 (i986), pp. 385-413 and the same author's 'Quetzalcoatl, King Ferdinand and Ignacio Allende Go to the Seashore: or Messianism and Mystical Kingship in Mexico, I8oo-I821', in Jaime Rodriguez 0.

A different bastion of loyalism was the siempre fiel island of Cuba, where the presence of a large and growing slave population, coupled with the recent traumatic experience of the Haitian revolution, ensured that the planter elite would remain loyal to Spain, on the grounds that 'Cuba sera espafiola o africana': Juan Martfnez Alier, Cuba: economiay sociedad (Paris, 1972), pp. 9-I0. 37 D.

During this period, revolts directed against taxation and other official abuses (conscription, clerical interference with 'folk' religion) appear to have been at least as important as those associated with agrarian dispossession.40 The result, whether in Chalco or Chiapas, was con- frontation: in the courts, in the plaza, on the battlefield. These were confrontations in which the peasantry did not lack all leverage. Through the first generation of independence, therefore, landlord lamentations of weak markets, scant profits, and feckless or downright hostile peasants came thick and fast.41 In certain cases, especially where incipient cash crops developed (such as Yucatan and Guerrero), or when national crises aggravated political instability, fiscal demands and military recruitment (e.g. during the Mexican-American War), major peasant revolts - often termed 'caste wars' - erupted, threatening the very integrity of the fragile nation state.42 Meantime, the liberal project of disentailment - of privatising church and village corporate landholdings - got under way: initially by means of local legislation, subsequently, with the liberal victory of 1854, at the level of national policy.43 As yet, however, conditions did not encourage a wholesale dispossession of the corporate for example, Eric Langer, Economic Change and Rural Resistance in Southern Bolivia, 1880-1930 (Stanford, 1989), pp. 75 and I88. 40 This is a rough conclusion culled from: Leticia Reina, Las rebeliones campesinas en Mexico (I819-1906) (Mexico, I980); Jean Meyer, Problemas campesinos y revueltas agrarias, 1821-10ro (Mexico, 1971); Robert Wasserstrom, Class and Society in Central Chiapas (Berkeley, i983), p.

Coatsworth, 'Patterns of Rural Rebellion', p. 5o, observes that 'the Mexican data do not clearly indicate the timing of the transition from tax-based to land disputes', although he also suggests, p. 5 5, that 'beginning in the 84os ... rural revolts now usually involved direct assaults on the haciendas as well as civil authority'. 41 Chalco landlords denounced 'perverse' peasants who, by virtue of their wayward independence, obstructed hacienda operations: Tutino, 'Agrarian Social Change', pp. I07-8, II4-I6; and, for similar complaints from Morelos, see Jan Bazant, 'El trabajo y los trabajadores en la Hacienda de Atlacomulco', in Elsa Cecilia Frost, et al.

The attack on village holdings became more vigorous and far-reaching; yet peasant protest dwindled. (Again, the pattern is not unique to Mexico.)47 However, the paradox is only ostensible and it would be wrong to see the decline of peasant protest as indicative of peasant contentment. True, the initial establishment of the Pax Porfiriana was welcomed, not just among Porfirio's coterie of Mexican (and, according to John Hart, Texan) backers.48 After twenty years of endemic civil war, peace was at a premium; and Porfirio himself came to power as a popular caudillo, the beneficiary of genuine peasant support.49 Porfirio's party, Ignacio Altamirano proclaimed, was 'the party of the people'.50 As Diaz built a stable and solvent regime, however, his need for popular backing diminished; whatever modest paternalism he had shown the 44 In the Chalco region, for example, 'the willingness of the peasants to resort to violence generally slowed the attacks on community landholding by elites and the liberal state': Tutino, 'Agrarian Social Change', p. 136. 45 Coatsworth, 'Patterns of Rural Rebellion', pp. 5o and 55, dates the shift from 'tax- based to land disputes' in the Andes to around I900; on the Andean timetable, see Langer, Economic Change, pp. I8-20, 30-1, 52ff., which suggests a 'tenuous equilibrium' between landed and peasant interests pertaining in much of southern Bolivia through the nineteenth century. Florencia Mallon, The Defense of Community in Peru's Central Highlands, Peasant Struggle and Capitalist Transition, 186o-I940 (Princeton, 1983), shows how 'peasant struggle' (and war with Chile) helped delay any 'capitalist transformation' of the rural economy of the central highlands well into the twentieth century. 46 On the greater ideological sophistication of later (roughly, post-I86o) rebellions, see Reina, Rebeliones campesinas, pp. 40-I; Friedrich Katz, 'Mexico: Restored Republic and Porfiriato, I967-1910' in Leslie Bethell (ed.), The Cambridge History of Latin America (Cambridge, I986), vol. 5, pp. I2-13; John M.

Mexico entered the world division of labour, supplementing its traditional precious metal exports with industrial minerals and agricultural products (henequen, cotton, coffee, chicle, sugar, rubber). Belatedly, Mexico began to pursue the path taken by Argentina and Brazil earlier in the century, albeit without succumbing to agrarian monoculture.54 Argentina, however, had expanded agricultural exports by colonising the pampas, eliminating its scant Indian population, and attracting millions of European immigrants; and Brazil had pushed its coffee frontier south, from Rio to Sao Paulo, relying initially on a huge slave labour force, subsequently on immigrant colono labour. Neither had had to dispossess a large native peasantry: none existed in Argentina (outside the marginal north-east), nor in the Brazilian coffee zone. In the Brazilian north-east, where a sizeable peasantry did exist, the sugar industry was in decline, surplus labour was available, and the classic (Mexican) confrontation of established villages and expansionist landlords was not replicated; on the contrary, Brazilian landlords successfully enmeshed workers and tenants in webs of deference and dependence.55 Contrasting patterns were evident in Chile, where the 51 Friedrich Katz, Porfirio Dia. frente al descontento popular regional (1891r-893) (Mexico, 1986), pp. i6-i8.

Hence Mexico was less vulnerable to international recession. Meanwhile, Mexico's agrarian exports grew, but across a diverse range of products; monoculture existed solely as a regional problem - most obviously in the case of Yucatan's henequen. 55 The moradores of the Brazilian north-east, commented a Brazilian senator, were 'united with the millowners by force of habit, by the influence of ancient customs, by ties of gratitude'; hence they displayed 'a just and reverential respect toward their</page><page sequence="12">I o Alan Knight resident inquilinos (a classic 'internal peasantry') remained locked within a dominant hacienda system; and in Colombia and parts of Venezuela, where the expansion of coffee initially favoured the growth of squatting and tenancy - that is, the creation of a new 'precipitate' peasantry, rather than the destruction of an old 'traditional' peasantry.56 In the rest of Andean America, meanwhile, the traditional villages of highland Peru and Bolivia enjoyed the continued benefits of relative economic stagnation (Tutino's 'decompression'). As of 19oo neither country possessed an extensive railroad system or a commercial agriculture dynamic enough to threaten the systematic annihilation of peasant farming.57 Peru's cotton was grown first by slaves, then by Chinese, then by enganchados, peasant migrants who trekked down from the highlands to the coast. This process, however coercive or consensual it might have been,58 did not landlords': Richard Graham, Patronage and Politics in Nineteenth-Century Brazil (Stanford, 1990), pp. 24-5. 56 Arnold Bauer, Chilean Rural Society: From the Spanish Conquest to I93o (Cambridge, I975), pp. i64-70; Catherine Legrand, Frontier Expansion and Peasant Protest in Colombia, I8Io-i936 (Albuquerque, I986), chs. 2 and 3; William Rosebery, Coffee and Capitalism in the VeneZuelan Andes (Austin, I983). As Legrand's study makes clear, 'precipitate - newly created, usually frontier - peasantries are quite capable of mobilisation and resistance: a classic example would be the peasant movement of La Convenci6n in Peru in the i96os. However, there is likely to be a significant time-lag between the initial process of colonisation and capitalist development and the subsequent phase of peasant protest; in the case of 'traditional' peasantries - such as the Mexicans - it is the initial process itself which tends to provoke resistance. 57 On the poor communications and weak market of the Andean zone, see Jose Maria Caballero, Economia agraria de la sierra peruana (Lima, I98I), pp. 296-8. It is arguable that the economic transformation wrought by the railways in Porfirian Mexico in the I88os had its Andean analogue in the development of roads and trucks after the 1940S: ibid., pp. 301-3 and Fiona Wilson, 'The Conflict Between Indigenous and Immigrant Commercial Systems in the Peruvian Central Sierra, 1900-1940', in Rory Miller (ed.), Region and Class in Modern Peruvian History (Liverpool, I987), pp. I25-62. As mentioned above (n. 39) Andean landlords often compensated for market weakness by squeezing tenants and workers, thus provoking protest; but, by the same token, a weak market inhibited the systematic expansion of latifundia in the sierra. Of course, hacienda expansion occurred, and stimulated significant peasant protest, such as the Chayanta revolt in southern Bolivia in I927 (see Langer, Economic Change, ch. 4). The Chayanta revolt, however, while it fell short of the insurrectionary scope and sophistication of Zapatismo, did prove capable of arresting the (comparatively weak) hacienda expansionism of the region; in which respect it more resembled nineteenth- century Mexican peasant movements, such as Chalco's, which were holding operations fought against economically shaky elites, not wars to the death against aggressive agrarian entrepreneurs, such as that fought by the Zapatistas against the Morelos sugar planters. 58 On the Peruvian enganche see Peter Blanchard, 'The Recruitment of Workers in the Peruvian Sierra at the Turn of the Century: The enganche System', Inter-American Economic Affairs, vol. 33 (1979), pp. 63-84, and - concerning consensus and coercion - the debate between Brian Loveman, 'Critique of Arnold Bauer's "Rural Workers in</page><page sequence="13">Mexico, 1821-1992 II require the dispossession of the highland villages; on the contrary, it could even serve to perpetuate them by funnelling resources from the coastal cash economy to the subsistence villages of the highlands.59 By opening up (that is, by yielding up labour) the not-so-closed corporate peasant community actually preserved some of its corporate and communal character, at least in the medium term. So, too, in Guatemala, where 'the expansion [of coffee] did not immediately threaten the survival of most [Indian] communities', and may even have bolstered some.60 This is not to say that the erosion of the peasant community in Peru, Bolivia or Guatemala was minimal or irrelevant.61 However, it had not proceeded as far or as fast as in Mexico, and this was for two main reasons. First, in Mexico agrarian commercialisation (a matter not solely of exports, important though they were)62 was more vigorous. Second, commercial- isation directly affected the - increasingly - densely populated highland zones (as well as some relatively densely populated irrigated zones of the north, such as the Yaqui Valley and the Laguna). Whereas in Peru cotton flourished on the coast, or in Guatemala coffee grew on the temperate slopes of the boca costa (both regions removed from the peasant heartland), in Mexico commercial farming existed cheek-by-jowl with established peasant communities, some of them centuries old. These communities did not spurn the market per se; but when the market brought dispossession, destitution, and cultural extinction, they resisted (fissure and colonisation were not usually viable options in Central Mexico, as they were in some Andean zones).63 And while it is certainly true that not all villages were Spanish America"', and Arnold Bauer, 'Reply', Hispanic American Historical Review, vol. 59 (1979), pp. 478-89. 59 Henri Favre, 'The dynamics of Indian peasant society and migration to coastal plantations in central Peru', in Kenneth Duncan and Ian Rutledge (eds.), Land and Labour in Latin America (Cambridge, 1977), p. 265; and see also Mallon, Defense of Community, pp. 156-64. 60 McCreery, 'State Power', p. I07. 61 The chief victims of the expansion of Peru's sugar plantations were agricultores ('part of a sizeable rural middle class'), rather than communal peasants; their dispossession and resentment helped to stimulate the rise of APRA - a coastal rather than a highland political phenomenon: see Peter F. Klaren, 'The Social and Economic Consequences of Modernization in the Peruvian Sugar Industry, 1870-I930', in Duncan and Rutledge, Land and Labour, pp. 229-67. 62 In view of the popularity of dependista thinking it is not surprising that exports have frequently been seen as the motor of Latin American (under)development and the root cause of both peasant dispossession and proletarian militancy: Charles Bergquist, Labor in Latin America. Comparative Essays on Chile, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia (Stanford, i986), is a sophisticated example of this approach. However, Mexican cash crops such as sugar and cotton were primarily produced for the domestic market. 63 Simon Miller, 'Land and Labour in Mexican Rural Insurrections', Bulletin of Latin American Research, vol. 0o (1991), p. 75 presumes (his terminology) that, when I advanced examples of peasant repudiation of the market, I succumbed to the</page><page sequence="14">112 Alan Knight dispossessed, and not all villages resisted, enough did to generate an extensive popular revolutionary movement after 1910. In short, we might say, Porfirian Mexico experienced a process of 'Brazilian' or 'Argentine' agrarian commercialisation which impinged upon a 'Peruvian' or 'Bolivian' peasantry.64 It was this combination, unique, certainly in terms of scale, in Latin America, which made possible Mexico's pioneer popular revolution and precocious agrarian reform. But popular mobilisation was not simply a knife and fork question. First, as James Scott has cogently argued, the logic of subsistence farming tends to generate a specific 'moral economy' which in turn underwrites, justifies and sustains popular mobilisation.65 The mounting demands of landlords - and/or the state - thus provoke protests which are neither crude Pavlovian responses, devoid of ideas, nor yet the calculating, cost- benefit stratagems of rational individualists.66 In addition, we must recognise that some popular and peasant protests responded to political rather than agrarian causes: that is, they were provoked less by material dispossession than by political oppression, which took the form of taxation, policing, forced recruitment, or the imposition of hated officials. 'traditional stereotype of the Indian village's communal introversion' (or, worse still, its 'idyllic past of collectivism'), which is but one of several odd arguments in this article. I certainly argued that Mexican peasants (I never said 'Indians') tended to resist rather than to espouse market production during the Porfiriato (which generalisation is hardly refuted by a couple of colonial citations); however, I both pointed to processes of internal stratification, whereby entrepreneurial rancheros arose from the common ruck of campesinos (Knight, The Mexican Revolution, vol. i, pp. I2--I5), and I recognised that 'some peasants... benefited [from enhanced demand], as suppliers of goods as well as labor' (Knight, 'The U.S. and the Mexican Peasantry', in Daniel Nugent (ed.), Rural Revolt in Mexico and U.S. Intervention [San Diego, I988], pp. 47-8). The crucial point, however, is that most Mexican peasants, especially most revolutionary peasants, tended to regard subsistence production as their chief priority and the market as a threatening rather than a beneficial force. 64 As a rough index of the relative impact of commercialisation, note that between 874 and I9Io Mexican exports increased tenfold, while population rose 52%; between 1880 and I913 Argentine exports rose ninefold, while population tripled. The best known statement concerning the need to assess the impact of export-led growth in terms of'the particular, historically developed class structures through which these processes worked themselves out' is that of Robert Brenner, 'The Origins of Capitalist Development: A Critique of Neo-Smithian Marxism', New Left Review, vol. 54 (I977), p. 91. 65 James C. Scott, The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia (New Haven, I976), which argument has been usefully developed in the Mexican context by Tutino, From Insurrection to Revolution, pp. I6-I7, 24 and 27. 66 See Samuel L. Popkin, The Rational Peasant. The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam (Berkeley, 1979). These arguments are echoed, in the Mexican context, by Paul J.

It assumed diverse ideological forms, depending on location, conjuncture and prior history. It was far from being mute, inarticulate and visceral. True, popular movements tended to be local in focus - albeit there is evidence of the focus widening during the later nineteenth century and, more so, during the Revolution ;7 and they also tended to be backward-looking, 'reactive', in Charles Tilly's terminology.71 But this did not make them dim-witted, lacking in class 67 Oscar Cornblit,' Society and Mass Rebellion in Eighteenth-Century Peru and Bolivia', in Latin American Affairs, St Antony's Papers no. 22, ed.

Of course, the distinction between 'agrarian' and 'political' grievances is not absolute or uncontentious: political power directly facilitated agrarian dispossession; or- by means of taxation, conscription or corvee - indirectly prodded peasants into the commercial agrarian economy, to the benefit of rural elites. Logically, however, political control and exactions had to precede agrarian dispossession; hence the state (or the church) was usually an older target than the landlord. The sequence may be schematically depicted in terms of a transition from a tributary mode (whereby peasants yielded a surplus to state or church) to a mode involving the private appropriation of surplus ('feudal' or 'capitalist' according to theoretical taste and historical circumstances). 68 William H.

Rather than wagging Leninist fingers at the deficient peasantry,72 we should make some effort to grasp the ideas and motives which lay behind their protests, even if these lacked the approved vehicle of a vanguard party. Here, two broad forms - or axes - of ideological identity demand immediate consideration: on the one hand, liberalism - and its counter- part, (Catholic) conservatism; and on the other hand, ethnicity and nationalism. These, of course, intertwine with each other; and, more importantly, they intertwine with the socio-economic and political factors - especially agrarian dispossession and state centralisation - which have already been mentioned. And it is important not to lose sight of these latter connections, not, in other words, to treat ideology as some sort of free-floating resource, ready to be 'appropriated' and 'interpellated' in defiance of socio-economic logic.73 On the contrary, the importance of ideology and identity can be fully appreciated only when these 'subjective' elements are in turn related to the structural and material circumstances - circumstances not of their own making -within which men (and women) made history. First, liberalism and Catholic conservatism. Just as Mexico appears to have generated a particularly rich crop of popular movements so, too, these movements were closely and increasingly associated with major political currents, above all liberalism and Catholic conservatism. These two distinctive features of Mexican history reinforce each other. The argument is not that the Mexican people were committed liberals (as liberal politicos, intellectuals and historians, then and now, would have us believe), nor yet that they were committed Catholics and conservatives (as their rivals, then and now, would contend).74 Rather, it is that these national, 'elite' divisions penetrated deep into the body politic and influenced - and, in turn, were influenced by - local feuds and mobilis- ations. The latter, while they often responded to local grievances, such as agrarian dispossession, frequently assumed national labels (Juarista, 72 See Arnaldo C6rdova, La ideologi'a de la Revolucidn Mexicana: La formacion del nuevo regimen (Mexico, 1973), p. 154. 73 Hunt, Politics, Culture and Class, pp. 13 and z23-4, offers a good example of the interaction of social groups and revolutionary ideology. 74 Jests Reyes Heroles, El liberalismo mexicano (3 vols., Mexico, I957-61) offers a paean to Mexican liberalism, celebrating - and perhaps exaggerating - its broad, popular, democratic and inclusionary character; as Hale, Transformation of Mexican Liberalism, pp. 14-I5, points out, this magisterial work significantly neglects the Porfiriato. For a contrasting view, which stresses the pervasive religiosity of Mexican people, see Jean Meyer, La Cristiada (3 vols., Mexico, I973-4), vol. 2, pp. 19 and 28, vol. 3, pp. 282 and 304.</page><page sequence="17">Mexico, 1821-1992 I I 5 imperialist, Maderista, Villista, Cristero) and acquired national signifi- cance. Hence the paradox of 'parochial' movements, like Zapata's, or even the Yaqui Indians, which played out national roles.75 Of course, this popular espousal of national labels and 'elite' ideas - of elements of one or other 'Great Tradition' - was hardly new.76 Within a generation of the Conquest, Indian prophets were rising up, brandishing Catholic symbols and mouthing Biblical phrases.77 Later generations of Indian rebels - such as the Chiapas cultists of 708-1 3 and 867-70 - also refashioned Catholicism into an ideology of resistance and protest, creating Indian saints, kings and churches, modelled according to Catholic, colonial norms.78 Protests of this kind not only reflected popular internalisation of such norms, but also, given the colonial state's political exclusivism, offered the most feasible form of political heterodoxy; a form which, while going beyond the pragmatic day-to-day rumbustiousness of village motines,79 did not overtly challenge the very bases of the colonial order (as, for example, the Tupac Amaru revolt, with its inversion of class and ethnic roles, arguably did).80 Indian religious heterodoxy thus could, to a degree be tolerated.81 The political messianism of the insurgency period was, perhaps, the last kick of this good old politico-religious cause.82 Thereafter, although the cause survived in the Maya south (still, 75 Warman, 'The Political Project of Zapatismo', argues against Zapatista parochialism, not altogether convincingly. It is worth mentioning that many revolutionary movements, and not simply those of peasant provenance, displayed a strong attachment to the patria chica: for example, the mapaches of Chiapas or the soberanistas of Oaxaca (both led by landlord elites): see Benjamin, A Rich Land, pp. z 3-6, and Garner, 'Oaxaca'. Conversely, the Zapatistas did entertain a lively notion of the nation. My point would be that Zapatista patriotism, premised on a strong identification with the patria chica, was inherently decentralising, even anarchist; while the patriotism of other revolutionary groups - such as the victorious Sonorans - tended to merge patria chica and patria grande in a powerful centralising ethos, which (in contradiction to 'patriotism') might better be designated 'nationalism'. 76 The 'Great/Little Tradition' dichotomy may be crude, but - in my view - it still has its uses: e.g. Alan Knight, 'Revolutionary Project, Recalcitrant People: Mexico, 1910-40', in Jaime Rodriguez O.

It could not compare, for vigour and significance, with Brazil's.84 A basic reason was that, in Mexico, significant alternatives existed: the political and ideological solidarity of Brazil's planter elite, which encouraged popular protest to seek messianic outlets, was not replicated in wartorn Mexico, where the insurgency and subsequent civil wars encouraged the mobilisation of popular forces behind new, secular banners, loosely liberal and con- servative, wielded by rival rabble-rousing caudillos.85 For while Mexican conservatism was inherently Catholic, it was rarely messianic or revivalist; the Cristeros, Meyer stresses, were not nativist proponents of a vestigial syncretic religion but, rather, patriotic orthodox Catholics, beneficiaries of the active Catholic proselytisation of the Porfiriato, well versed in the Bible, driven to rebellion by the pretensions of an arrogant, anticlerical state.86 By the same token, outright nativism - harking back to preconquest regimes and symbols - was weak. Even during the colony, projects for the restoration of Aztec rule were few and hardly threatening, especially in the populous Mexican heartland. There was no Mexican parallel to the Tupac Amaru revolt which convulsed Upper Peru in the I78os; the Tulancingo rebellion of I769 was small beer in comparison.87 Several reasons can be adduced: Aztec rule had been particularly bloody and, in many regions, unpopular; it lacked the vestigial legitimacy of the Inka.88 More important, the destruction of the Aztec empire and the Mexican nobility had been more complete, more traumatic, than the equivalent processes in Andean America. Even where Indian caciques survived in 83 Bricker, The Indian Christ, ch. 8. Paul Vanderwood's work-in-progress on the Tomochi revolt stresses its religious and messianic character: 'Comparing Mexican Independence with the Revolution: Causes, Concepts and Pitfalls', in Rodriguez (ed.), The Independence of Mexico, pp. 32 1-2, and the same author's 'God's Law versus State Rule: Tom6chic, I891-1892', paper given at the Conference on 'Popular Culture, State Formation and the Mexican Revolution', Center for US-Mexican Studies, University of California, San Diego, 27 Feb.-z March 991i.

They could not compare, in terms of prestige, influence and autonomy, with the kurakas of the Andes who not only retained a good deal of local power but even flaunted their Inka ancestry and appearance.89 Finally, the twin processes of miscegenation and 'acculturation' (or, if you prefer, 'de-Indianisation') proceeded farther and faster in Mexico than in Andean or Central America (especially Guatemala). As population slumped, as haciendas and towns, miners and merchants, extended their sway throughout New Spain, the repiblica de indios could not maintain that pristine autonomy which the early friars had favoured. No more could the Jesuits insulate the Yaquis from the demands - and opportunities - of the Spanish settler society (not least because the Yaquis did not want to be so insulated).90 By the end of the colonial period, the very term 'Indian' was well on the way to becoming a social - and fiscal - construct, stripped of its phenotypical significance.91 Thus in Mexico - and, perhaps, its closest South American counterpart, Colombia - national politics did not rest on the bedrock of caste and ethnicity, as they did in Guatemala, Peru or Bolivia; instead, alternative secular foundations were laid down. A key factor in this process was the geopolitical significance of Mexico City's location. The primate city of New Spain, built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan, Mexico City commanded the populous central highlands, seat of the old Aztec empire. Roads, religion and trade radiated from this central point, emulating the dendritic pattern of the Aztec tributary system, albeit with more success and stamina.92 Lima, in contrast, huddled on the coast, far from the Indian population of the Andes, 'drawing its wealth and sustenance from a vast hinterland which its governors rarely, 89 Taylor, Drinking, Homicide and Rebellion, p. I26, attributes the relative weakness of Mexican messianism at least in part to the absence of 'messianic leadership by hereditary native nobles'.

While allowing for abundant syncretism and apostasy, and discounting the excessive lyricism of Ricard, we can accept that the Catholic 'Great Tradition' provided Mexico, especially Central Mexico, with an ideo- logical and institutional carapace relatively lacking in Andean America,94 and thus, by affording a certain shared discourse, laid the groundwork for expressions of patriotism which, if they were chiefly creole in inspiration and expression, could to some degree cross class and ethnic barriers. The most potent symbol of this patriotism, of course, was the Virgin of Guadalupe, who signified the chosen state of the Mexican people, not least the Indians, one of whose number had been privileged to witness the Virgin's apparition at Tepeyac in I53 .95 However, to the extent that the Catholic Church had put down deep roots, both ideologically and institutionally, it also stood as a potential challenger to any ambitious secular state; the church's successful proselytisation in the colonial period (and after), its marked contribution to the formation of a distinctively Mexican nation and society, ensured its subsequent 'persecution' at the hands of a jealous state. Again, Colombia offers a closer parallel than, say, Peru, Bolivia, or even Brazil, where anticlericalism possessed less force and rationale. By the early nineteenth century, therefore, ethnicity in Mexico had lost much of its earlier defining power. The rigid pigmentocracy of the colony was formally abandoned; Indians and castes became citizens, at least in theory; and political discourse assumed a republican rather than a racial terminology. More important, over time ethnic identities grew blurred, especially in central and northern Mexico.

Zapata's followers were 'Indians' to hostile critics and muckrakers; to their own way of thinking (it seems) they were campesinos - and liberal patriots.96 Outside Yucatan, Chiapas, and perhaps the Huasteca, fears of 'caste war' were exaggerated, either deliberately or unconsciously; Mexican elites, unlike their Andean counterparts, did not live in mortal fear of the milling Indian hordes and their murky Indian atavisms.97 Indeed, Mexican elites recurrently called upon Indian support during their incessant civil wars. Sometimes they came unstuck - most obviously when the Yucateco elite armed the Maya in the 84os, triggering the Caste War. More often, Indians proved to be useful, if sometimes wayward, recruits: Juan Alvarez of Guerrero successfully cultivated Indian support in the I84os; Manuel Lozada led the Indians of Nayarit in the name of Maximilian in the I86os; Porfirio Dfaz relied on Juchiteco troops (as did the Veracruzano revolutionary Gabriel Gavira); while Alvaro Obreg6n rose to power on the backs on his redoubtable Yaqui soldiery.98 This repeated association of Mexican popular mobilisation, Indian and mestizo, with mainstream national conflicts and multi-class coalitions, has been noted by historians; and it contrasts with the experience of Andean America, where the elite recruitment of Indian forces was rarer, riskier, and incapable of forging genuine national coalitions.99 The phenomenon not only reflects the ideological and institutional integration achieved under the colony, to which I have just referred, but also helps explain the 96 Womack, Zapata, pp. 70-I.

There were colonial premonitions of this more 'relaxed' attitude toward 'Indian' revolt, at least in central Mexico: Taylor, Drinking, Homicide and Rebellion, pp. 20-I. The situation in the Andes was clearly different: fears of caste war and 'racist polarization' remained strong and were, if anything, aggravated in the late nineteenth century: Tristan Platt, 'The Andean Experience of Bolivian Liberalism, I825-1900: Roots of Rebellion in 19th-Century Chayanta (Potosi)', in Stern, Resistance, pp. 3 I 5-20. Half a century later, the Bolivian revolution, by giving land and votes to the Indians and creating a network of powerful campesino caciques, revived these fears: 'in Achacachi... an Aymara peasant leader has established a little dominion for himself, issuing permits to go through the district.

Compared to many Latin American countries (again, Colombia would be an exception) Mexico is notable for the deep and precocious development of 'modern' political affiliations, basically liberal and (Catholic) con- servative.100 When we seek to explain these affiliations - some of which have proven remarkably durable over time - we often look for 'structural' factors, affinities between ideology and, say, social class or geographical region, which assume some 'fit' between the two. Discourse theory notwithstanding, there is still a lot to be said for this explanatory method. In the case of nineteenth-century Mexico, the crucible in which these new affiliations were first forged, certain structural features are apparent. Roughly, a liberal periphery - or 'liberal crescent' - confronted a conservative centre:101 a pattern evident elsewhere in Latin America, which in turn reflected the strength of the Church in the more densely populated, Indian, 'colonial' highlands (the Mexican mesa central; the Andes, from New Granada down to the mountainous interior of the province of the Rio de la Plata), and its corresponding weakness in coastal and frontier regions, which had developed under Bourbon auspices in the late colony (the Mexican north and Gulf coast; Venezuela; the Platine lowlands); and which was further reinforced by the relative strength, in the former, of colonial interests, such as artisans and manufacturers, who feared the effects of free trade and advocated tariff protection and gremial solidarity (e.g. Puebla and Bogota) and of mercantile groups, eager for free trade, in the latter.'02 Liberal attacks on corporate organisations, which targeted the Church, the guilds, and the Indian villages, reinforced this pattern. Hence the recurrent image of conservative Catholic highland cities (Mexico City, San Crist6bal, Bogota, Quito) and liberal anticlerical trading ports (Veracruz, Barranquilla, Guayaquil, Buenos Aires).103 100 See Robert H. Dix, Colombia: The Political Dimensions of Change (New Haven, 1967), pp. 203ff., concerning the 'hereditary hatreds' of Colombian politics (p. 21z) which, Dix stresses (p. 2 3), spanned social classes, and were not confined to warring elites. 101 D.

Liberalism could also elicit powerful popular support; sometimes, perhaps, despite its formal programme (more of that in a moment); but also, on occasions, because of that programme. Again, several reasons can be (briefly) adduced. The liberal inclination towards federalism - usually stronger when liberals were out of power than when they were in - appealed to groups who resented the impositions of the central government: in particular, regional caudillos and their followers, the latter including peasants whose historic experience of the central government was one of taxation and conscription. Like Juan Alvarez, whose Guerrero cacicazgo was built on such foundations, the liberal caciques of the Sierra Norte de Puebla also based their popular liberalism on the defence of the patria chica.?05 Northern caudillos and communities similarly saw liberalism as the best defence of parochialism.106 Second, the appeal - and fruits - of disentailment were not confined to big landlords, even if the latter were the chief beneficiaries. Some peasants and rancheros also acquired land through the break-up of church and village corporate holdings and, in some measure, the liberal goal of creating a solid, loyal, liberal yeomanry was met.107 Third, the popular appeal of liberal anticlericalism should not be discounted. True, anticlericalism probably incurred more enmity than 104 For a forthright and stimulating statement of this position, see John Tutino, 'Patterns of Culture in Mexican History: From Colonial Hegemony to National Conflict', paper given at the VIII Conference of Mexican and North American Historians, San Diego, 19 Oct. I990. Similar assumptions - concerning the un- or anti-popular character of liberalism - are to be found in European historiography: e.g., Eric Hobsbawm, 'Mass-Producing Traditions: Europe I870-1914', in Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger (eds.), The Invention of Tradition (Cambridge, 1983), p. 268. 105 Diaz Dfaz, Caudillos y caciques; Guy P.

Nevertheless, it would be wrong to assume that the church was universally revered, or that clerics were invariably respected. Clerical abuses -exorbitant church fees, individual peculation, and outright politicking - were well known, and in many parts of the country, such as the coastal lowlands and much of the north, the institutional church was chronically weak.108 Finally, the independence movement left a legacy of Hispanophobia which liberals were better placed to express than their conservative, Hispanophile rivals. Royalist repression sowed bitter memories, especially among veteran insurgents.109 The expulsion of the Spaniards became a popular issue, espoused by populist liberals (and deplored by Catholic conservatives); once enacted, it redounded to the benefit of Mexican merchants and petty officials.l10 Hostility to the gachupines became a hallmark of liberalism and an early example of the liberal-patriotic amalgam which would characterise the nineteenth century. Furthermore, not all the gachupines left in the i8zos; some remained, some came afresh from the peninsula-or, after 1898, from Cuba. Their socioeconomic roles (hacienda administrator and mayordomo; shopkeeper, pawnbroker and wholesaler) guaranteed them the antipathy of the popular classes and ensured that Mexico would experience recurrent outbreaks of Hispanophobia, stretching from the insurgency of 18io to the Revolution of I9 o.111 These 'structural' affinities and allegiances were reinforced - in Mexico and elsewhere - by institutional factors. Disentailment created a liberal economic constituency. Schools and colleges, some of them revamped colonial seminaries, carried the liberal message and prepared new cadres 108 Stuart Voss, On the Periphery of Nineteenth-Century Mexico: Sonora and Sinaloa, I8ro-I877 (Tucson, I982), pp. 50 and 80-i, on the weakness of the Church in the north-west. Popular anticlericalism and irreligion have been little studied and, perhaps, underestimated. For some examples: Stanley C. Green, The Mexican Republic: The First Decade, I823-I832 (Pittsburgh, 1987), pp. 217-18; Ralph Roeder, Judrez and his Mexico (2 vols., New York, 1968), vol. i, pp. 56-7. During the Revolution, voceadores allegedly sold their newspapers more briskly by flipping them open at the pages containing Orozco's (often virulently anticlerical) cartoons: Alma Reed, Orozco (New York, I956), pp. 6-7; were there nineteenth-century precedents for this sales pitch? 109 'Fear and even terror of military retribution might restore order', Christon Archer writes of the Spanish counter-insurgency of the i8ios, 'but in their hearts the Mexicans had come to abhor Spaniards and Spanish rule': "'La Causa Buena": The Counterinsurgency Army of New Spain and the Ten Years War', in Rodriguez (ed.), Independence of Mexico, p. 91. 110 Harold Sims, La expulsidn de los espanoles de Mexico, 182I-I828 (Mexico, 1974); Romeo Flores Cabellero, Counterrevolution.

But perhaps most important was the influence of family and community. At a time when, throughout Latin America, politics depended heavily on family networks, liberal lineages were created and recreated, reinforced by recurrent feuds, defeats, myths and martyrs.113 Similarly, communities acquired liberal (or, of course, conservative) allegiances and reputations. Sometimes, these obeyed the rough geopolitical outline described above. Often, however, they revealed a more complex and contingent pattern, the product of shifting historical events: wars, revolutions, coups, vendettas.l4 As a result, the creation of liberal and conservative affiliation was likely - perhaps was bound - to follow a somewhat random, tesserated pattern. If clan A became liberal, clan B would incline to conservatism; so, too, with community C and D, clientele F and G, and so on. Again, Mexico was not alone: close parallels can be seen in, for example, Colombia, where the liberal-conservative divide was also deep, but also somewhat random in its original incidence; or, to take a more distant parallel, in revolutionary and postrevolutionary France. 11 In many cases, no doubt, the choice of allegiance was at least in part instrumental, the product of expedience as much as conviction: protesters called themselves 'liberals' or 'conservatives' because it was good politics, or good military tactics. However, even persistent instrumental usage has its consequences; if you call yourself a liberal (or a conservative) long enough, some liberalism (or conservatism) may rub off, the more so 112 Ann Staples, 'Panorama Educativo al Comienzo de la Vida Independiente', in Josefina Zoraida Vizquez et al.

Like slave- owners who pledged adherence to the Bill of Rights, or leaders of 'Workers' Democracies' who confronted independent trade unions, nineteenth-century liberals dug a discursive trap for themselves; ultimately, they could not entirely evade the democratic implications of their opportunistic rhetoric. At any rate, even if discourse lacks the determining -even thaumaturgical - power attributed to it by some modish analysts, we may assume that it is not without consequence, and that even contingent allegiances, suitably rehearsed, justified and celebrated over time, can acquire a tenacity and conviction which belie their modest, sometimes murky, origins. While such a pattern of political acculturation may be plotted in much of Latin America (and for a range of social classes too), in Mexico the pattern was particularly strongly etched because political allegiances were defined, during the nineteenth century, amid foreign invasion and resistance and, during the twentieth, amid social revolution. These collective experiences were crucial. After all, the creation of ingrained partisanships, characterising regions, communities and clans, was, by itself, a recipe for chaos and conflict, not stable centralised rule. And, indeed chaos and conflict were endemic: initially between 1821 and 1876, and again after the Revolution of I9Io, when much of the country first reverted to a state of nature (c. I910-17), then (roughly 1917-40) continued to engage in violent local struggles in defiance of the (supposed) revolutionary Leviathan.117 The ultimate destination of such a process - had it continued, feeding on itself, and had 'Leviathan' never grown to maturity - would have been a social debacle analogous to the Colombian Violencia, an endemic partisan struggle, mingled with banditry and social protest, capable of bleeding society and the state without reconstituting either.118 That this did not transpire in Mexico had a lot to 116 A similar distinction - between 'sentiment evocation' and 'ideological persuasion' - is put forward by Bruce Lincoln, Discourse and the Construction of Society. Comparative Studies of Myth, Ritual and Classification (Oxford, I989), p.

We have noted that early nineteenth-century liberalism fed on the popular Hispanophobia generated by the insurgency. In a later generation, liberalism acquired further patriotic laurels by virtue of Juarez's struggle against Maximilian and the French (conversely, as a result of their disastrous alliance with the same, the conservatives lost, for the time being, any claims to be the party of the patria). Conservatism was disgraced, conservatives were proscribed or compelled to colonise the victorious (but fractious) liberal coalition. Meanwhile, schools, songs, stories, ceremonies, statues and street names all served to commemorate the liberal-patriotic triumph.l19 Thus, Brading argues, the desiccated individualist liberalism of earlier days acquired, during the-mid-nineteenth century, a patriotic appeal - potent, collective, even romantic.120 Mexican liberalism, we may say, transcended its Enlightenment origins - and its emphasis on political economy - and acquired some of the affective power associated with Romanticism. A relative failure in terms of its liberal policies, Juarismo succeeded as an engine of discursive invention and proselytisation.121 In part this occurred in Mexico because of foreign invasion: a foreign invasion of crude, colonial style, which brought with it all the practices of primitive counter-insurgency.122 We may note in passing that such attempts at 'formal' empire-building, geared to territorial conquest, are likely to be much more efficacious in generating patriotism, nationalism, anti-imperialism, than the more subtle and insidious modes of 'informal' empire, or 'neo-imperialism'.123 But Mexico, of course, was not the sole victim of foreign invasion in Latin America in the nineteenth century. Why, then, should this factor be stressed? First, because Mexico was twice invaded by great powers: by the United States in 1846-8 and by France in 1863-6. The invaders were not only great powers, but also culturally alien; they threatened the very existence of the nation; and the ensuing wars were bitter and costly. No other Latin American country travelled 119 On the politico-cultural significance of the brass band, see Thomson, 'Bulwarks of Patriotic Liberalism'. 120 Brading, The First America, p. 662. Nicaraguan liberalism, too, acquired powerful patriotic and emotive force, not least thanks to the exploits of Sandino - who, himself, had been strongly influenced by Mexican examples and traditions: Donald C. Hodges, Intellectual Foundations of the Nicaraguan Revolution (Austin, 1986), especially pp. 80-5. 121 Laurens Ballard Perry, Judre. and Dia~: Machine Politics in Mexico (DeKalb, 1978), dissects the practical failures of Juarista liberalism. 122 Jack Autrey Dabbs, The French Army in Mexico, i86r-1867 (The Hague, I963), pp. 85, I23, 13I, I45 and 219-37. 123 Knight, U.S.-Mexican Relations, pp. 32-9 and I45, suggests that direct foreign intervention - invasion being the extreme case - is more effective in stimulating patriotic and anti-imperialist reactions than economic 'dependency', however marked or pervasive. 5-2</page><page sequence="28">I 26 Alan Knight such a national calvary. However, there are interesting parallels which appear to support the argument. Rafael Carrera's defence of Guatemala against invading forces franked his political hegemony and - along with other factors - helped solidify his enduring popularity among the Indian population (and Carrera, of course, was a conservative).124 Paraguay's tenacious defence against the armies of the Triple Alliance revealed, if it did not create, a distinctive Guarani patriotism, which also spanned classes.125 Peruvian resistance to the Chilean invaders after 1879 depended, Florencia Mallon argues, on a nascent peasant patriotism, upon which Andres Caceres could capitalise to fight the campaign of La Brefa.'26 Finally, Cuban nationalism was forged in the fires of two wars against Spain and two (if not three) American interventions; while Sandino's resistance to the U.S.A. both embodied and reinforced a vigorous Nicaraguan nationalism.127 If, as Marxist analysis suggests, the market provided the incubator of bourgeois nationalism, foreign war - and its attendant abuses - stimulated a form of popular, even peasant, patriotism which was distinct from, even antithetical to, the state-building, centralising nationalism of the bourgeoisie.128 In the cauldron of war and revolution, peasant defence of the patria chica enhanced peasant awareness of the patria grande. If these cases (which do not, of course, exhaust the global possibilities)129 confirm the plausible association between foreign in- vasion, peasant mobilisation, and popular patriotism, it remains to be explained why, in Mexico, this association had more profound con- 124 Ralph Lee Woodward Jr., 'Changes in the Nineteenth-Century Guatemalan State and its Indian Policies', in Smith, Guatemalan Indians, pp. 60-70; Keith Micelli, 'Rafael Carrera: Defender and Promoter of Peasant Interests in Guatemala, I837--I848', The Americas, vol. 31 (I974), pp. 72-95. 125 John Hoyt Williams, 'Race, Threat and Geography: The Paraguayan Experience of Nationalism', Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism, vol.

In both Cuba and Central America, however, the association of US interventionism and nationalism did not prevent some politicos from encouraging intervention out of partisan interest; this phenomenon was much rarer in Mexico. 128 For the classic Marxist association of nationalism and the market, see Gilles Bourque, L'Etat Capitaliste et la Question Nationale (Montreal, 1977), ch. i. This association informs Heraclio Bonilla's position in his interesting debate with Mallon and Manrique concerning Peruvian peasant 'nationalism': see Mallon, 'Nationalist and Antistate Coalitions' and Bonilla, 'The Indian Peasantry and "Peru" during the War with Chile', in Stern, Resistance, pp. 219-3I. 129 See Chalmers Johnson, Peasant Nationalism and Communist Power: The Emergence of Revolutionary China (Stanford, i962).</page><page sequence="29">Mexico, 1821-1992 I27 sequences. In Peru, after all, the peasant patriots went home disgruntled and betrayed; the war did not afford a platform for successful nation- building; and, indeed, radical intellectuals continued to bemoan the lack of national sentiments and integration which bedeviled Peru.l30 In Guatemala, likewise, Carrera's popular coalition - the last, best, chance of nineteenth-century nation-building, some suggest - split apart and gave way to a rigidly divided 'plural' society.'13 In the Mexican case, several considerations are pertinent. First, the liberals built upon existing ideological foundations. The 'creole patriotism' and incipient indigenismo of the eighteenth century - themselves products of colonial integration and discourse - had been further refined in the alembic of the insurgency; the liberals of the Reform could thus hark back to Hidalgo and his peers.132 Peruvian patriots, in contrast, were starting from scratch. Second, the fact of a liberal triumph (compared to Carrera's conservative victory in Guatemala) made for a more durable outcome, for the simple reason that the goals of liberalism - free market economics, exports, disentailment - were more attuned to the times. Hence the liberal conquest of power in Guatemala in the I870s, or the failure of Garcfa Moreno's conservative Catholic project in Ecuador.l33 A liberal political economy was mandated; but Mexican liberalism - patriotic, triumphant, and mythologised - came to embody much more than the arid principles of Carlyle's Dismal Science. Third, Mexico's geopolitical position gave a fillip to patriotism. Alone of the Latin American nations Mexico had suffered territorial mutilation 130 Mallon, Defense of Community, p. 12i, notes that the Peruvian peasantry's potential for organization by a reformist nationalist coalition' went untapped, in contrast to the Mexican (or Chinese) revolutionary experience of nationalist mobilisation; Bonilla, 'Indian Peasantry', p. 227, questions the depth of this potential; for later lamentations, see Mariategui, Seven Interpretive Essays, pp. 163-4, and Julio Cotler, 'De Velasco a Belaunde: el problema de la construcci6n nacional y la democracia en Peru', in Pablo Gonzalez Casanova (coord.), El estado en America Latina: Teora y prdctica (Mexico, 1990), pp. 349-66. Demelas, Nationalisme sans nation?, pp. 11-28, sees a similar development of popular nationalism in Bolivia at the time of the War of the Pacific, leading to 'un sentiment nationale populaire durable'; but the evidence is thin and certainly the potential, to the extent that it existed, again went untapped. 131 Carol A.

Juarez, like most mid-century liberals, was a believer (Roeder, Judrez, vol. i, pp. 81 and I30) and even twentieth-century anticlericals, who flaunted their antipathy to Catholicism, were not averse to appropriating Catholic symbols or invoking the authority of Jesus (Knight, 'Revolutionary Project', pp. 247-50).

Peru's humiliation at the hands of Chile rankled - and helped produce a distinctive military, unusually concerned to achieve national integration, even by radical means.134 But when Peruvians spoke of their 'secular foe' to the south,135 they clearly did not entertain the same medullary fears as Mexicans when they confronted the coloso del norte. For it was not just a question of the marked - and growing - disparity in size and strength. The United States was also culturally alien: 'Anglo-Saxon', Protestant, and, increasingly, the purveyor of an enveloping materialist, later consumerist, culture. The threat was therefore military, economic, religious and cultural. The bilateral relationship, unlike any in Latin America, more closely resembled Poland's relationship to Russia, or Ireland's to England.136 Not surprisingly, Mexican leaders - of all political hues -displayed a profound suspicion of the United States (albeit a suspicion often allied to a sneaking admiration). None could afford to truckle to the gringos; those who did - such as Juarez and Ocampo - came to regret it.137 Even supposed 'collaborators' with US capital, such as Diaz, were careful to assert national dignity in their dealings with the U.S.A.; as were more 'conservative' revolutionaries like Carranza after i9Io.138 Meanwhile, the most virulent form of anti-Americanism emanated from Catholic conservative groups, including Cristeros, Sinarquistas, and the ageing Vasconcelos.'39 Whereas in Central America and the Caribbean there were plenty ofpoliticos who were prepared to risk - even invite - US intervention in order to save their own skins, such a breed was rare in Mexico. Indeed, selling out the patria was the stock-in- trade insult of both left and right, liberal and conservative, later Marxist and fascist. But, perhaps most important of all, the liberal-patriotic amalgam of the later nineteenth century was further tempered in the furnace of the social revolution, an experience unique within Latin America, at least until the 195 os. The 191o Revolution occurred because a political crisis - associated 134 Cynthia McClintock, 'Peru: Precarious Regimes, Authoritarian and Democratic', in Larry Diamond, Juan J.

Such a political crisis was not unique to Mexico (compare Chile in 1893, Argentina in I916, Brazil, perhaps, in 910o); nor was the so-called 'social question', which drew attention to the burgeoning cities and the growing urban working class. Indeed, urban working class protest was a good deal more vigorous and threatening in Argentina or Chile (specifically, Buenos Aires, Santiago and Valparaiso); and liberalism, rather than socialism or anarchism, was the preferred ideology of the infant Mexican labour movement.140 In contrast, it was the Mexican peasantry, provoked by landlord, cacique and politico, which turned a political crisis into Latin America's first social revolution. That revolution, as I have already suggested, stemmed from the twin processes of economic development and political centralisation, as they bore down upon a dense peasantry, possessed of ideological, organisational, and (in some measure) physical means of resistance. While some root-and-branch revisionists would deny the popular character of the Mexican Revolution, most would agree that the years 1910- 5 witnessed widespread popular mobilisation and, as a result, the temporary collapse of the state. For their part, 'traditionalist' historians - those who stress the popular and agrarian character of the Revolution - nevertheless recognise that the Revolution did not result in a popular victory; that, from about 91 5 onwards, a new state was forged which, in some respects, continued the work of the Porfirian old regime. To recognise this fact, and thus to depart from the more extreme, self- congratulatory myths of the official party, is not, however, to accept that the Revolution changed little, that the Revolution was just a 'blip' on the screen of history,141 or that Mexico's distinctive historical trajectory since 1920 was not profoundly conditioned by that revolutionary experience. In general terms, the popular peasant movement was defeated. The ancient dream of political and economic autonomy was not realised; if the peasants got land, they did so at the hands of the revolutionary state and the agrarian bureaucracy. For some, like the doughty guerrilleros of Namiquipa, this was little short of an insult; the land was theirs, sanctioned by precedent and won with blood; it was not to be foisted on them under the new and alien guise of the ejido.142 In many other cases, however, the ejido was the welcome fruit of popular struggle.

Apart from subjective considerations of justice - what was right, what was merited -we must also take into account the objective facts: of land turnover, of the dispossession of landlords, of the reconstitution, on a massive scale, of the Mexican peasantry. The land reform which the Revolution initiated, and which was its major structural accomplishment, varied from place to place and from time to time. Certainly, it was shot through with graft, careerism and violence (as well as self-sacrifice, idealism, and hard work); it is impossible to summarise so complex a transformation in a glib one-liner (that it served social justice, satisfied peasant land hunger, delivered the peasantry into the trammels of a Machiavellian state, or facilitated the building of capitalism).l44 It did all of those things, to varying degrees. The temporal as well as the geographical vantage point is crucial. In the 9z20s and 1930S the agrarian reform was innovative, destabilising, contested, sometimes radical and by no means controlled from above. After I940 its character changed: while it still responded to popular demands (for example, in the I97os), it was now a more thoroughly 'top-down' and bureaucratic process.145 It was also a process whose compatibility with capital accumulation and political stability seemed broadly proven; whereas, in the twenty years after 1920, this was by no means clear. Then, particularly in the mid-I 930s, the agrarian reform seemed to promise a new collectivist agriculture, which implicitly challenged the sanctity of private property and the logic of private capital accumulation.'46 After 1940 landowners might bridle at the threat of reform, but they were aware that it did not challenge the prevailing socio-economic system. And politicians - of different complexions - acquired a certain practised assurance in the manipulation of agrarismo. The popular insurgency of the Revolution, itself the culmination of a century of sporadic peasant mobilisation, thus forced upon the national agenda a major agrarian reform, unique in Latin America at the time. Indeed, while reforms have come thick and fast since the 1940s, it is arguable that none, bar the Cuban, outdid the Mexican reform in terms of 143 Benjamin, A Rich Land, p. 206. 144 Alan Knight, 'Land and Society in Revolutionary Mexico: The Destruction of the Great Haciendas', Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, vol. 7 (1991), pp. 73-104.

Furthermore, it was a decisive outcome in terms of Mexico's sociopolitical development. If, during the I92os and (a fortiori) the 1930s, the agrarian reform seemed to challenge the rationale of capitalism, this was decreasingly the case after 1940. Since then, the reform has functionally co-existed with rapid capital accumulation, renewed foreign investment, dynamic agricultural exports, and relatively tight political control of the countryside (manifested in the massive PRI votes returned by rural regions through the 195os and i96os).148 This control, of course, has been continually contested and phases of renewed reform (Sonora in the mid-1970s; the Huasteca in the i980s) have indicated the capacity of rural popular movements to influence state policy and, at times, to buck official control. But even these reformist episodes attest to the state's readiness to countenance specific reforms, thereby to maintain the entire system; to sacrifice a few propertied interests in order to shore up the greater edifice of property and privilege.'49 Such selective reformism - tempered and offset by repression - is a hallmark of Mexican 'revolutionary' politics which numerous observers have stressed and which has displayed remarkable continuity throughout decades of disruptive social change (urbanisation, migration, industrialisation). From a comparative perspective, it is worth contrasting this capacity to respond and to reform (again, I stress, selectively, even cynically) with the root- and-branch repression favoured in Guatemala or El Salvador; or the downright incapacity of the Peruvian state either to command allegiance or enforce compliance over large tracts of the southern highlands.'50 Thus, out of apparent illegitimacy and crisis, the official party has more than once managed to pluck - if not enthusiastic endorsement - at least 147 During the I920s and 1930s the Mexican agrarian reform first eroded, then eliminated, large commercial haciendas, which practised demesne farming, produced for vigorous markets, and in some cases exported; the Bolivian reform - probably the closest competitor in terms of scope and radicalism - eliminated more 'traditional' haciendas, which were largely divided into small, subsistence peasant plots (or extensive pastoral tracts). The Mexican reform, in other words, attacked a (loosely) Gutsherrschaft system, the Bolivian a Grundsherrschaft system. Aside from figures of area or recipients, therefore, the former was arguably a more radical process. 148 Pablo Gonzilez Casanova, Democracy in Mexico (Oxford, I970), pp. 124-6. 149 The classic formulation is Marx's discussion of the English Factory Acts: measures undertaken by the state - 'acting in the interests of capital in general' - in order to curb capital's 'werewolf hunger for surplus labour', which would ultimately jeopardise its own very existence: John Holloway and Sol Picciotto, 'Introduction: Towards a Materialist Theory of the State', in Holloway and Picciotto (eds.), State and Capital.

The old practices of patronage, public works, and populist rhetoric (now subsumed under the new umbrella of Pronasol) are seen to continue, and, indeed, to be revamped, amid the white heat of Salinas' technocratic revolution. 15 I have elsewhere suggested that the course of Mexican history since the Revolution can still be usefully analysed in terms of the (now antiquated ?) notion of a bourgeois revolution.152 Not because the Revolution was wrought by a class-conscious bourgeoisie, successfully bidding for power, nor because the policies of the Revolution uniformly favoured that class. Such simplistic notions, now severely qualified even in the pioneer cases of seventeenth-century England or eighteenth-century France, cannot be sustained for Mexico either.153 After all, the bourgeoisie recoiled from the upheaval of the Revolution and remained leery of the agrarian reform (among other policies) through to the 19405. However, it can be argued that the long term consequences of the Revolution, many of which were never planned in advance, and which were, rather, the product of a complex and unpredictable dialectic, favoured the creation of a strong state, wedded to a project of capital accumulation; which project in turn benefited from the destruction of the old landlord class and its latifundista holdings, and their replacement by vigorous rural (and urban) capitalists, favoured - but not slavishly represented - by the state. The PRI has not served as a committee for the management of the affairs of the bourgeoisie, and the latter, especially in its more dynamic and powerful manifestations (such as the Monterrey Group), has held aloof from the PRI.154 But that was no bad thing: big business retained sufficient sub rosa links to the official party; it could exert a kind of veto power (not least through the medium of capital flight); and it could benefit from the 'relatively 151 For a good analysis of PRONASOL, see Denise Dresser, 'Neopopulist Solutions to Neoliberal Problems: Mexico's National Solidarity Program', unpublished paper, Center for US-Mexican Studies, University of California, San Diego, I991.

Nor is this pattern particularly unusual. French capitalism has done quite nicely without enjoying direct party representation; Spanish capitalism has boomed under 'socialist' auspices. As for Latin America, the very instability which has characterised many polities suggests an absence of direct capitalist (or multinational) control; as Rouquie comments, noting the relative lack of foreign investment in the supposed 'business dictatorships' of Argentina, Uruguay and Chile, 'it is a strange capitalism that is able to establish regimes at its convenience but cannot make a profit from them'."55 Although some of the Mexican bourgeoisie flirted with fascism in the 1930s, the relationship was never consummated. The Monterrey Group preferred the PAN, which quickly shed its Falangist feathers after 1940; and, during the era of praetorian coups and 'bureaucratic authoritarianism' in the southern cone, Mexico's bour- geoisie did not feel the need to call on the army to save its collective skin. 156 Two other aspects of Mexico's 'bourgeois revolution' demand attention. Again, they point to parallels with Europe and contrasts with the rest of Latin America. First, the association of popular revolution with 'bourgeois revolution', although somewhat paradoxical, is not, of course, historically anomalous. As Mariategui (among others) perceived, popular mobilisation contributed decisively to the destruction of the old regime in England and France.157 French peasants burned chateaux and terriers, obliging the moderates in Paris to enact an agrarian reform. This did not usher in a peasant utopia; but it helped to dismantle feudalism. In Mexico, too, where 'feudalism' was socio-economic rather than strictly juridical, peasant insurgency again helped eliminate latifundismo, broke the back of the landed oligarchy, undermined peonage, and ensured the distribution of land to the peasants. By breaking down hacienda self-sufficiency and affording the peasantry greater access to land and resources, this process stimulated the domestic market, and helped make possible the import- substitution industrialisation of the post-I930 era.158 Less obvious but perhaps not less important were the political and 155 Alain Rouquie, The Military and the State in Latin America (Berkeley, I987), p. 8. 156 However, the avoidance of systematic centralised repression has not ruled out a good deal of localised violence, especially where a powerful agrarian bourgeoisie confronts an active campesino movement: Schryer, Ethnicity and Class Conflict, pp. 279-80; Abraham Garcia Ibarra, Los Bdrbaros del Norte: La Contra Mexicana (Mexico, I988). In addition, the existence of a diverse and fairly free press does not mean that the lives and livelihoods of independent journalists are risk-free. 157 Mariategui, Seven Interpretive Essays, pp. 45-6. 158 Enrique Cardenas, 'La gran depresi6n y la industrializaci6n: el caso de Mexico', in Rosemary Thorp (comp.), America Latina en los aios treinta.

Mexico did not, of course, take the path of classic liberal democracy. It may have avoided bureaucratic authoritarianism, but it has enjoyed less formal democracy than, say, Costa Rica or Venezuela in the last generation. But there are good grounds for breaking, or substantially weakening, the presumed tie between 'bourgeois revolutions' (or, as we might say, processes of analogous socio-economic transformation) and liberal democracy.159 England experienced over a century of oligarchic and capitalist rule following the definitive defeat of royal absolutism; France, too, took nearly a century to consolidate republican democracy following the revolution of I789. But 'bourgeois' revolutions-or 'processes of analogous socioeconomic transformation' -involve much more than formal political arrangements. As already suggested, they involve, negatively, the destruction of the socio-economic impedimenta of the old regime: in Mexico's case, the landed oligarchy and its daunting combination of agrarian and political power. And they further involve, positively, the establishment of an environment within which 'bourgeois ', 'capitalist' values and practices can flourish, such an environment embracing: the legal protection of business; the provision of an infrastructure (transport, communications, currency); the consolidation of a national market (and, perhaps, the promotion of foreign markets); and, above all, the provision of political stability, which, in turn, requires the creation of some sort of broad legitimacy (or hegemony, consensus, even 'false consciousness ).160 In other words, capitalism depends on much more than a providential 'bourgeois' seizure of power; it requires the construction of an entire social, economic and political edifice - the 'Great Arch' conceived of by Thompson and analysed by Corrigan and Sayer.'16 While these capitalist desiderata may co-exist (functionally?) with liberal democracy, the association does not seem to be automatic or necessary. In Mexico's case, capitalism has flourished under the auspices of the dominant party; and done rather better than in, say, Argentina since Peron, where the state has failed to provide a stable political environment. Of course, if the present Mexican administration lives up to its professed goals of both economic and political modernisation, the presumed association of capitalism and democracy may eventually materialise in Mexico too. However, that remains to be seen. As the 'Great Arch' metaphor makes clear, political and cultural factors are crucial in the establishment and maintenance of a successful capitalist 159 Blackbourn and Eley, Peculiarities, pp. 55-60 and 75-83. 160 Ibid., pp. 75, 83 and 86-7.

Argentina, after all, needed no bourgeois revolution to install capitalism, since a capitalist economy was built from scratch during the nineteenth century, in roughly the same way as in Canada or Australia, such that Argentina, around 1900, figured, within Latin America, as a model of economic success and political culture. But that model was arguably seriously flawed; and Argentina perhaps laboured under the influence of 'guiding fictions' which were not conducive to the creation of a legitimate state based upon inclusionary citizenship.162 Certainly the model did not ensure either sustained capitalist development or stable liberal democracy in the last half-century. Mexico's revolution played a crucial negative role - in helping to demolish the impedimenta of the past, which were far more formidable in Mexico than Argentina - but it also went further, positively facilitating political and cultural changes which underwrote both the 'miracle' of the postwar decades and the survival act of the I98os. For, if the later nineteenth century witnessed the triumph of liberalism - the result not simply of military prowess, but also of ideological and institutional creativity - the Revolution achieved a comparable feat in the twentieth century. First, in military terms, the revolutionaries annihilated the Federal Army (and, unlike the Bolivian revolutionaries of the I95os, they did not make the mistake of rebuilding it). Rather, the revolutionary army supplanted its professional predecessor (which implied a shift from a 'statist' to a 'societal' military);163 then, during the I92os, the revolutionary army was slimmed, disciplined, and professionalised. The civilian control thus established was never broken: Cedillo's coup in 1938 was a fiasco; Almazan flirted with rebellion in 1940 but realised that discretion was the better part of valour. The military budget shrank, releasing resources for other purposes and indicating the poverty of praetorianism.164 The other great pillar of conservatism, which might have posed a challenge to the revolutionary state, was the Church, which Calles set out to undermine, if not to destroy, in the mid-igzos. The ensuing civil war - the Cristiada - was Mexico's domestic Crimea: losses were heavy, military reputations suffered, outright victory proved elusive. But, just as the Crimean War defanged Russia for a generation,165 so the Cristiada taught the Church - that is to say the hierarchy - a hard lesson. Urged by Rome, the bishops sold out the rank-and-file Cristeros, cut a deal with the state, and traded institutional survival for political reticence. 162 Nicolas Shumway, The Invention of Argentina (Berkeley, I99I), p. xi and passim. 163 Rouquie, The Military and the State, p. 42. 164 James W.

More important, perhaps, the effective ban on confessional politics averted a Catholic/conservative revival, and with it a return to the bitter liberal- Catholic partisanship of the mid-nineteenth century. Whereas Diaz's defusing of Church-State conflict proved to be no more than a holding operation, the revolutionaries' more draconian solution to the problem has held for over half a century.'70 It was - returning to the comparison with Colombia - as if the Violencia had turned into a thorough social revolution, from which the liberals had emerged victorious, condemning the conservatives to marginality and proscription, ending the ancient national vendetta. These were negative achievements: the punishing of enemies rather than the rewarding of friends. On the positive side, the revolutionary state also achieved a measure of durable legitimacy. Three elements may be 166 Jean Meyer, La Cristiada, vol. i, p. 53. 167 Alan Knight, 'The Politics of the Expropriation', in Jonathan Brown and Alan Knight (eds.), The Mexican Petroleum Industry in the Twentieth Century (Austin, forthcoming, i992). 168 Soledad Loaeza, Clases medias politica en Mexico (Mexico, 1988), ch. 6. 169 Knight, Mexican Revolution, vol. i, pp. 40I-4. 170 The achievement is the more remarkable in that the Mexican Church was, by Latin American standards, particularly powerful: in Brazil, for example, the (Catholic) Church tended to be weaker and middle-class in composition; as such, it became - under Vargas - virtually a junior partner in government and retained that role at least until the I96os: see Thomas Bruneau, The Church in Bragil. The Politics of Religion (Austin, 1982), pp. i9ff. In Argentina, Adolfo Gilly argues, a feeble liberalism compromised with a powerful Catholic Church, allowing the latter to retain ample political influence, in conjunction with landlords and military, to the detriment of national integration and governmental legitimacy: 'La anomalia argentina (estado, corporaciones y trabajadores)', in Gonzilez Casanova (ed.), El estado en America Latina, p. 191.</page><page sequence="39">Mexico, 1821-1-992 37 mentioned. First, the revolutionaries solved the intractable problem of political succession and the related circulation of elites. They did not resort to indefinite re-election, as had Diaz and his cronies; nor did they succumb to the praetorian challenges which greeted each presidential succession during the 9o20s. Following the 'elite settlement' of I929 the emergent party, built around a tightly knit 'revolutionary family', controlled the presidential succession and made short work of those who defied the rules of the game (at least until i988).7" Official politics came to depend on an intricate system of clientelism, patronage, and unwritten rules, the most important of which was that loyalty to the system counted. Disappointed presidential candidates were taught to bite on the bullet; a powerful sense of collective loyalty, premised on self-interest and, no doubt, an affective attachment to 'the Revolution', guaranteed order and discipline.172 Second, this orderly and disciplined elite contrived to maintain something of a mass base. Mexico's was an 'inclusionary' authorit- arianism.l73 The evidence for this can be found in the relative absence of popular challenges to the regime; in the weakness (at least until 1988) of parties of the left ;174 and (for what it is worth) in the positive evidence of legitimacy to be culled from opinion polls.175 But the explanation for this is another matter. No doubt a powerful factor is the sheer longevity of the regime and the array of weapons (literal and, still more, figurative) which it has at its disposal. The celebrated combination of repression and co- option which has characterised Mexican politics for decades is well suited to deter effective opposition. Opposition is allowed (even encouraged and subsidised) in certain quarters; significant opposition currents are channelled towards the PRI; those who will not or cannot be co-opted are warned, jostled, and, on occasions, eliminated. Such a system works because it is, to a degree, 'inclusionary' and it avoids root-and-branch repression. It also works because its practitioners have had years of practice and learned the 'revolutionary' way of doing politics. Between 1910 and 1940 that meant confronting powerful popular movements and conceding (sometimes pre-emptively sponsoring) extensive social reform; after 1940, even if the popular movements lost ground, the pattern of 171 Alan Knight, 'Mexico's Elite Settlement: Conjuncture and Consequences', in John Higley and Michael Burton (eds.), Elites and Democratic Consolidation in Latin America and Southern Europe (Cambridge, I992), pp. 113-45. 172 Susan Kaufman Purcell and John F.

For, as I suggested earlier, the constant recitation of populist and reformist rhetoric carries consequences; draconian centralised repression of the left, of unions, of peasants and intellectuals would involve - let us say - rather more cognitive dissonance among Mexican elites than their Argentine counterparts, whose national myths and 'guiding fictions' are of a different stamp.176 What is more, the Mexican system, by virtue of its revolutionary and populist origins, embodies important channels of mediation - even representation- which act as a brake on national elites. These channels are not, as in 'Western democracies', primarily electoral, although the importance of elections, especially state and local elections, should not be underestimated, even for the period preceding the 'political reform' of the late 1970s.177 Rather, they tend to be corporatist and 'cacical'. One of the great achievements of the Revolution, in which it clearly superseded the Porfiriato, was its creation of'inclusionary' networks, linking people and government: local caciques, party bosses, ejidal bureaucrats, labour leaders.178 These were not genuinely elected, nor did they faithfully represent their constituencies. Often they channelled orders (e.g. electoral orders) down, from czipula to rank-and-file. But this was necessarily a two-way process. Such 'link-men' also mediated, distributing state patronage (jobs and public works), communicating demands from below. They had to: caciques who failed to deliver proved vulnerable (and the toppling of unpopular caciques was a regular phenomenon); union or peasant leaders who imperiously disregarded the grievances of their constituencies were likely to face breakaways, independent challenges, sanctions from above.179 Thus, even 176 Shumway, Invention of Argentina; Gilly, 'La anomalia argentina', pp. I90-I. 177 Carlos Martfnez Assad (ed.), Municipios en conflicto (Mexico, I985); Jeffrey W.

Thirdly, these institutional factors help to validate the ideology of the Revolution. I have suggested that the rhetoric of the Revolution, however repetitive and shallow, is not irrelevant.8"' It is significant that Mexican political rhetoric remains broadly egalitarian and progressive, even if- in the matter of indigenismo, for example - rhetoric and reality are sometimes far apart.182 Furthermore, that rhetoric- its symbols, images, myths and slogans - links to the powerful liberal-patriot tradition already mentioned. Of course, the Revolution was not a simple re-run of the Reforma (indeed, with regard to land reform, Brading writes, 'the task of the Revolution was to reverse the work of the Reform');183 nevertheless, the continuities were striking, at the level of political geography, family allegiances, ideas, slogans and myths. Liberal zones (like the north) as well as liberal pueblos (like Zapata's Anenecuilco) tended to be revolutionary.'84 Families and clans noted for their nineteenth-century liberalism were prominent in the ranks of the Revolution (and were subjectively aware of this continuity).185 The heroes of the Reform were acclaimed and quoted; revolutionary conquests, like the 1938 petroleum nationalisation, took their place within a sequence of patriotic achievements, from Hidalgo through Juarez to el caso de los Altos de Jalisco (Mexico, 1976), p. 70; Mirquez, 'Gonzalo N. Santos', pp. 392-3; Ian Roxborough, Unions and Politics in Mexico. The Case of the Automobile Industry (Cambridge, 1984), pp. 80, 86, Ioi and io5-6. 180 For example, Schryer, Ethnicity and Class Conflict, pp. 259-66. 181 As Hobsbawm argues ('Mass-Producing Traditions', pp. 269-70) the social stability achieved under the French Third Republic did not depend on the invention of republican traditions; but the latter -- for all their contradictions - certainly helped bind the infant republic together. 182 Alan Knight, 'Racism, Revolution and Indigenismo: Mexico, I910-I940', in Richard Graham (ed.), The Idea of Race in Latin America, I870-I94o (Austin, 1990), pp. 71-11 4. As an official ideology Mexican indigenismo has its faults, both theoretical and practical; but it can hardly be said to suffer from comparison with, for example, Guatemalan official thinking on the 'Indian question'; indeed, some Guatemalan spokesmen, subscribing to the view that 'all that is good in Mexico ... is Latin', saw fit to 'decry the indigenista fervor in Mexico': Richard N. Adams, 'Ethnic Images and Strategies in 1944' in Smith, Guatemalan Indians, p. I47. 183 Brading, The First America, p. 66i. 184 Womack, Zapata, pp. 7-8 and 400. 185 Knight, Mexican Revolution, vol. i, pp. 68-9.</page><page sequence="42">140 Alan Knight Cardenas.186 New revolutionary martyrs were added to the old list: Madero, Zapata, Carrillo Puerto joined Hidalgo and Morelos. Public rhetoric, street names, secular fiestas and school curricula all reinforced these powerful associations.187 That these associations were sometimes contradictory - for example, when revolutionary anticlericals applauded Hidalgo and Morelos - was not crucial, for the force of ideology depends on its powers of mobilisation (or, in modern jargon, 'interpellation'), not its internal logic. In this respect, the ideological spadework of the nineteenth century paid off. It did not matter that Hidalgo and Morelos were priests; it did matter that they had mobilised the Mexican people in a great and patriotic cause. Juarez (and his lieutenants) had assumed the banner in the I85os and I86os, which now passed into the hands of the revolutionaries. The Revolution thus represented the third great collective mobilisation of the Mexican people; an experience which, especially as it was softened with time and gilded with rhetoric, reinforced sentiments of solidarity and nationalism. 'Avoir fait de grandes choses ensemble, vouloir en faire encore' - Renan's definition of nationalism - fitted precisely.l88 The fact that revolutionary mobilisation, from the i9Ios through the 1930s, was associated with profound national divisions - ethnic, ideological, regional, factional and class-related - was progressively glossed over. The reified Revolution blurred such divisions; it played down the internecine strife of the revolutionary leaders; it even appropriated Catholic symbols in its manufacture of a public religion.189 Secular and anticlerical, the revolutionary regime did not write off the patriotic capital of the past just because it carried Catholic connotations.190 On the other hand, the regime was implacable towards enemies who might challenge its claims to 186 Knight, 'Politics of the Expropriation'. 187 Judith Friedlander, 'The Socialization of the Cargo System: An Example From Post- Revolutionary Mexico', Latin American Research Review, vol. 16 (i98I), pp. 132-44; Knight, 'Revolutionary Project', p. 246. 188 Ernest Renan, 'Qu'est-ce qu'un nation ?', in Oeuvres Completes de Ernest Renan (io vols., Paris, 1954), vol. i, p. 904. 189 Ilene V. O'Malley, The iMyth of the Revolution: Hero Cults and the Institutionali7ation of the Mexican State, 1920-1940 (Westport, Conn., 198 i); Knight, 'Revolutionary Project', p. 249. As Renan also argues, the formation of a national consciousness involves not just celebratory commemoration, but also a certain selective amnesia: 'l'oubli, et je dirai meme l'erreur historique, sont un facteur essential de la creation de la nation': 'Qu'est- ce qu'une nation?', p. 891. 190 Hence the interesting (alleged) reaction of a prominent revolutionary - 'perhaps the fiercest enemy of Catholicism in Mexico'- who, when his gringo interlocutor concurred that 'in 400 years there had never really been a really decent Mexican bishop or priest', 'looked startled for a minute, and then turned purple with anger. "What do you mean?" he roared.

Mexico did not need such 'exotic doctrines', it had no time for the hirelings of Rome or Moscow. Geopolitics reinforced this stance. We have noted that Mexico's proximity to - and mutilation by - the United States generated under- standable fears. Mexico could not escape and, certainly in economic terms, did not want to escape American influence. Even the revolutionaries, celebrated for their supposed economic nationalism, were keen for American trade and investment.191 But the repeated US incursions and interferences of 1910-20 revived old fears, which did not subside until the late I920S; and, even as the spectre of armed intervention receded, the risks of economic dependency remained and, indeed, were dramatically augmented during the 1940S.192 No 'revolutionary' could ignore this fact of political life. Miguel Aleman, the PRI presidential candidate in 1946, seen by history as the chief architect of the conservative postwar Mexican regime, was initially regarded by the United States as a dangerous nationalist.193 Thereafter, as is well known, successive administrations have paraded their nationalism and independence of the U.S.A. All this would be of little purpose if the ideology of the Revolution was confined to the governmental elite (as, for example, the comparable ideology of Peru's military rulers was largely confined to the ruling elite during the I970s).194 Certainly, one purpose of revolutionary ideology - its slogans, shibboleths and symbols - has been to reinforce elite unity.195 But it has also afforded a bridge between elite and people, the ideological counterpart of the institutional (often caciquista) links already discussed. It is extraordinarily difficult to gauge popular commitment to the rhetoric and regime of the Revolution. Certainly there have been important groups - Catholics especially - who repudiated the main tenets of the Revolution, although since the 1940S their repudiation has grown more moderate, their strategy more pragmatic. Equally, there is plenty of evidence of popular scepticism and cynicism, which is hardly surprising. On the other hand, polls (in the i96os) supposedly revealed that 'the democratic aspiration of the Mexican Revolution ... is meaningful to the population' and the 1988 presidential campaign displayed a deep reservoir of 191 Linda Hall, 'Banks, Oil, and the Reinstitutionalization of the Mexican State', in Rodriguez, Revolutionary Process, pp. 189-211; Knight, US-Mexican Relations, ch. 5. 192 Blanca Torres Ramirez, Historia de la Revolucidn Mexicana.

The public response to that challenge, too, reveals interesting continuities: not only the positive evaluation of, say, Lizaro Cdrdenas, but also negative evaluations of the present administration which point to its gachupin (Spanish, anti-national) character, even appearance.197 As Florencia Mallon has pointed out, comparing Peruvian and Mexican political dissent, while the first (Sendero) involves a root-and-branch repudiation of the current regime, the second (neo-Cardenismo) represents a breakaway from the regime, claiming greater fidelity to the regime's historic roots.l98 Even when the rules of the revolutionary game break down, therefore, the broader legitimacy of the Revolution constrains the scope of opposition, ensuring that political conflict remains within a defined orbit. By the same token, the ideological bankruptcy which has overtaken European regimes claiming 'revolutionary' status has not yet claimed Mexico (prophets of gloom to the contrary).199 While the statues of Stalin, Ceaucescu and Tito are tumbling, those of Madero, Zapata, and Cardenas remain squarely on their plinths. The Mexican Revolution, buoyed by its Protean, 'inclusionary' bulk, stabilised by banks of historical outriggers, remains afloat; even if the direction in which it sails remains uncertain. This brings me to a final point of contemporary relevance. The policy of the current Mexican administration involves some significant departures from 'revolutionary' orthodoxy, especially in the economic realm. The old structure of tariffs, quotas and subsidies is being dismantled; free trade with the United States is being negotiated; state industries (including revolutionary icons like Cananea) are being sold off. Now, the administration talks of 'flexibilizing' (winding up?) the ejido.200 In the political realm, the talk (if not the action) is of modernisation and democratisation -including detente with the Church. If successfully carried through - which is a big 'if' - this programme would result in a 196 Almond and Verba, The Civic Culture, p. 4I 5; Wayne Cornelius, Judith Gentleman and Peter H.

Significantly, President Salinas prefers to justify the PRI's continued monopoly of national power with pointed comparisons not to the defunct workers' democracies of Eastern Europe but rather to the Italian Christian Democrats or the Japanese Liberals: parties whose legitimacy rests primarily on their successful running of a (broadly) free market capitalist economy. That would seem to be the direction favoured by the so-called technocrats who now appear to dominate Mexican government policy. If successful, they would complete the historic mission of a bourgeois-democratic revolution: the installation of a dynamic capitalism married to liberal democracy. In this sense, they are as much carriers of (one) revolutionary tradition as their more radical - yet also more nostalgic -- Cardenista critics. Yet the picture is not so clear. Alongside this present commitment to market economics and to the legitimacy of the marketplace a good deal of the old revolutionary way of doing things continues. Foreign bankers express scepticism as to whether the market, rather than politics, will govern investment decisions and the administration's Solidarity pro- gramme, which appears to have been a political success, embodies the old revolutionary tradition of populism and public works.201 What is more, even if the national government and party leadership favour democratis- ation - of the PRI, of the entire political system - it is not clear that they can achieve these goals in the face of local and corporate footdragging, even outright opposition. The 1988 presidential election was an inauspicious start for a democratising administration; and the country's electoral history since 1988, while illuminated by the PAN gubernatorial victory in Baja California, has also been darkened by 'alchemy' and confrontation, the result, we must presume, of either official connivance, or official incapacity.202 Either way, the transition from 'inclusionary authoritarianism' to limpid democracy, from the familiar past to the notional future, appears uncertain and, at best, incipient. Continuities are also evident in foreign policy (the desire for a free trade agreement with the U.S.A. has not prevented Mexico from cold-shouldering the Endara regime in Panama); and the celebration of 'Thirty Centuries of Mexican 201 Dresser, 'Neopopulist Solutions'. 202 The yet more recent elections of August i99i revealed considerable support for the PRI, not least in regions - like the Federal District - where the ruling party had fared badly in I988. Again, however, there were allegations of fraud and, in two cases where powerful opposition candidates lost gubernatorial contests in contentious cir- cumstances (Guanajuato and San Luis Potosi), the winning PRI candidates subsequently stood down (or were stood down by presidential order). Again, therefore, we see an administration sensitive to adverse opinion but reluctant to take its chances in entirely limpid elections.</page><page sequence="46">144 Alan Knight Culture' has given fresh opportunity for lauding Mexico's rich, distinctive, national patrimony, for unfurling the old banner of cultural nationalism. I concluded an earlier essay on the Mexican Revolution with Mao's famous comment, uttered when his judgement on the French Revolution was solicited: 'it is too early to say'.203 I meant to suggest that the Mexican Revolution, often written off as 'dead' or 'betrayed', in fact embodied complex strands and traditions, which had generated - and might again generate - quite different policies and outcomes. Dormancy should not be taken as terminal demise. Indeed, talk of 'death' and 'betrayal' is an excessively anthropomorphic way of viewing such a complex and heterogeneous historical process. Thus far, the Revolution - that is to say, the regime born of the Revolution - has conferred a degree of political stability and historical continuity unusual for Latin America; an achievement made possible by its location within a broader, cumulative sequence - Independence, Reform, Revolution - which we may interpret in terms of both socio-economic transformation (ultimately of 'bourgeois-capitalist' character) and national integration - political, ideological and cultural. Together, these episodes and their residues make up the Mexican 'Great Arch' (Paz would no doubt prefer a 'Great Pyramid'): an edifice unique within the Latin American landscape in respect of its mass and durability. In light of this distinctive history it remains to be seen whether the current regime is perfecting the Arch or, wittingly or not, chipping away at its very foundations. 203 Knight, 'The Mexican Revolution', p. 47.</page></plain_text>
