Some say we teach music, others say we teach children, and the peace- makers say we teach children music. Assuming that we all might agree to "teach children music," what kind of music should be taught? In Aesthetics, Schwadron urges us to "guide others to dis- tinguish differences between mun- dane musical delight and artistic significance." He also says, "Music education must strive to dissipate the notion of one art for the elite and another art for the masses." On the contrary, Timothy Clif- ford reminds us that all human traits follow a frequency pattern similar to that of the normal curve. A few are very low or very high in any trait, but most cluster near the middle. "Less than half, perhaps less than one-tenth of our 188 mil- lion citizens have a need to enjoy aesthetic music."5 Bennett Reimer advocates the study of aesthetic music: We gain nothing by studying the medi- ocre or the trite, except in fostering medi- ocre or trite responses. Courses which use for their material a sampling of the great works of music, and which study these works by emphasizing their expressive content, will go a long way toward satis- fying the criteria of relevance and im- portance which all curriculum reform projects accept as their guidelines.6 Some people are convinced that 5Timothy Clifford, "Skew That Curve," Music Educators Journal, Vol. 52 (Novem- ber-December 1965), p. 88. 6Bennett Reimer, "The Curriculum Re- form Explosion and the Problem of Sec- ondary General Music," Music Educators Journal, Vol. 53 (January 1966), p. 118.

Royal Stanton argues that those who re- ject the commonplace run the risk of ending all communication. "It makes a mockery of the claim that music education is for every child, for it places it in a position of snobbery, while other agencies, less troubled by such scruples, get the job done."' Mr. Stanton suggests that knowledge of great music be- gins, for today's youngsters, with the study of rock, pop, and com- mercial music. Whether champions of great music or awful music, music edu- cators have made an astonishingly puny dent in the hard shell of public taste. Statistics on the "cul- tural revolution" indicate that the most popular instruments and music are learned independently, not in the schools. For instarce, in 1965 most of the 37 million amateur musicians in the United States played the piano (22.3 million), the guitar (7.5 million), or the organ (3.6 million). Classical music ac- counted for only fifteen percent of all record sales in that year (down to five percent last year), while the top record was "Wooly Bully" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs. Less than five percent of Americans attend a live performance, whether of rock or classical music, in a typical season.8 The band is probably the most popular performing group in Amer- ican schools; if not, it is certainly the group that gets most of the budget and most of the attention from the public. Does the band develop the student's perception of great art, or is it an institution for mass art? An authoritative answer to this question comes from Rich- ard Franko Goldman in The Wind Band: "The band is not 'high brow' and should not try to be. The high- browism one occasionally finds in band circles not only leads to a dead end, but is culturally regres- sive. A third issue clouded by double- think is how to teach: what meth- ods are most effective? Some favor performance methods because they require active participation. Others say listening is no less active, and 7Stanton, p. 111. 8"Second Only to Reading," Time (Jan- uary 14, 1966), p. 56. even better for you. In practice, we have performance for the band, orchestra, and chorus, although the majority of students do not par- ticipate in any of these groups. General music, often a required junior high school course, is a cha- otic attempt to persuade adoles- cents that a few listening experi- ences, combined with assorted ac- tivities under even more varied learning conditions, will give them the ability to understand "great" music. General music is rarely taught by teachers specifically trained for that task. Meanwhile, Schwadron writes, "Specialized music is an outgrowth of general music, not a substitute." The idea of new curricula for music education is currently very fashionable. Reformers mean to avoid being the purveyors of pas- sive listening deplored by Virgil Thomson in The State of Music: Their attempts to disseminate musical knowledge among musically illiterate adults seem to have led them eventually to substitute for instruction in listening some exercise in musical execution, such as choral singing or the practice of some simple instrument like the recorder. It would seem that such execution, which, however elementary, is a positive musical act, gives not only its own pleasure of personal achievement but also not incon- siderable insight into the substance of all music. Some music critics express even stronger distaste for passive music instruction. Donald Henahan of Down Beat magazine writes, "The passive music course cannot help ending in sterility and frustration." He contrasts this with a look at music teaching in Hungary: As a result of Kodaly's school-music re- forms, Hungarians read music with about as much effort as we use in reading our daily newspaper . . . our average intelli- gent layman just sits in front of a TV or hi-fi set and says, "Let the culture pour all over me."9 Reimer, in organizing a new gen- eral music curriculum, hopes to dis- courage passive reception of music. Nevertheless, he says active per- formance by itself does not develop aesthetic sensitivity-the ability to react with feeling to art or music and to perceive the aesthetic con- tent of an art work. Feeling cannot be taught, but perception can. Aesthetic perception can be de- veloped in three ways, according to "Donald Henahan, "Comments on Clas- sics," Down Beat (March 11, 1965), p. 31. Reimer: by developing concepts and knowledge, through analysis, and through performance. Perform- ance alone is inadequate, since it too often is nothing more than me- chanical manipulation of an instru- ment."' On the contrary, music critic Robert Marsh expressed his doubts about verbalizations on music in a letter to the author: Appreciating music, as my own teacher (Hindemith) would put it, is making music. It is active rather than passive in nature. It is putting a skill to work, not wallowing in sounds and pleasing the teacher with fancy verbalizations. Some of the best musicians are verbally limited. They talk with their instruments. Some of the prize music appreciators are slick talkers whose response to music is actually quite superficial. The dispute over performance versus "active listening" may be more a matter of emphasis than of conflict. Those favoring perform- ance insist that near professional standards are essential if worth- while results are expected. Those favoring the development of con- cepts, knowledge, and listening skills tend to minimize the need for the ordinary learner to develop high levels of performance ability. The whole problem is further com- plicated by questions of performing media, kinds of music, the quality of instruction, and the individual goals of learners. In view of the controversies about methods, one would expect educators to produce scientific evi- dence substantiating their claims for one method over another. Dou- blethink once more interferes, with the result that music education re- search is best used as a drunk uses a lamp post-for support rather than for illumination. If one accepts the findings of available research, he must concede that music teachers have not ac- complished much over the years. A study by Reimer in the Journal of Research in Music Education found that students who did not participate in school music pro- grams have about the same musical tastes as those who did." While many people refuse to accept such CONTINUED ON PAGE 109 10Bennett Reimer, "The Development of Aesthetic Sensitivity," Music Educators Journal, Vol. 51 (January 1965), p. 33.

In the same article, Reimer says: If research shows that objectives are more likely to be fulfilled in one way rather than another, the program builder must know this and must develop his program on the basis of such knowledge [author's italics]. Martin Mayer quotes a similar statement in his book The Schools: "Research," writes the psychologist Lee Cronbach with the assurance of a man stating something incontrovertible, "can first reveal the essential nature of any problem and then test the efficacy of any proposed improvement in practice." No physicist would be capable of such a statement. "Research" in any science is raw material for judgment, and valueless without judgment. To say that people's judgments tend to be better when backed by information is by no means to say that "research shows." And when the subjects are such tricky and uncontrollable speci- mens as human animals, the information gained by research may well be wrong. Judgments based on wrong information may be worse than judgments without information. It is possible that we are too little concerned with research and, at the same time, too willing to accept the findings of "professional research- ers." One is reminded of George Bernard Shaw's comment: "You can chain a terrier to Richter's desk, and force it to listen to all the sym- phonies of Beethoven, without changing its opinion one jot as to the relative delights of rat-hunting and classic music; and the same thing is true in its degree of man- kind." The forced comparison tech- nique used by education research- ers almost invariably leads children to choose not rat-hunting like the dog, but rock or pop rather than Lily Pons singing "The Burning Tapers" from Lucia.2 With all this obfuscation from doublethink, how can we then deal meaningfully with the basic prob- lems of music education? The an- 2Victor H. Bauman, "Teen-Age Music Preferences," Council for Research in Mu- sic Education, Bulletin No. 15 (Winter 1969), p. 23. swer to the question whom to teach is supposed to be "teach everyone," but music education has actually concentrated on the few. Many un- qualified classroom teachers are asked to present music in the ele- mentary schools, while in the sec- ondary schools only a minority of students study music, though the secondary schools have the majority of the qualified music teachers. Before we can answer the ques- tion of whom to teach, we ought to consider when to teach. The popu- lar advice, "Git thar fustest with the mostest," would be appropriate for us today. If we concentrate our forces, we might learn whether Suzuki is correct: Talent is common, but a favorable en- vironment is not. ... All human beings are born with great potentialities. We must investigate methods through which all children can develop their talents." In deciding what to teach, we have assumed that everyone can, and should, appreciate great music. We fail, however, to provide great music in the early years. Claude Palisca, in Music in Our Schools, A Search for Improvement, says, "Too much of the school repertory now consists of counterfeited and syn- thetic, rather than genuine, folk and art products." The continued failure of scat- tered efforts to share the culture of the elite with everyone may indi- cate that musical taste is distributed on the normal curve, like other traits. Charles Leonhard has said: It is time we face the fact that we are subjecting students in schools to music that receives scant, if any, attention from them outside of school.... I propose that the content of the music program be ex- panded to include not only masters of the past but the masters of the present, not only the artists of the established musical culture but also the artists of the new generation's musical culture."4 Expansion of content does not "Quoted in Maya Pines, Revolution in Learning (New York: Harper and Row, 1967), p. xi.

We should not forget the words of Doc Severinsen: "A lot of trash passes for Art these days.""' The third problem, how to teach, has been thoroughly confused by doublethink. Efforts to teach every- one have led to the abandoning of goals aimed at developing universal musical literacy. Inadequate in- struction in the early years and un- favorable conditions in the junior high school years have led to di- luted objectives stressing non- musical attainments as the desired ends of music instruction. General music has failed to reach its stated aim to provide musical learning for students, especially those not in performing groups. The failure of general music has led to criticism of performance ac- tivities for not achieving the goals originally set for general music. Passing the buck has become a valued method of professional sur- vival. Mursell called general music the trunk of the tree and perform- ance specialties the branches. Just "5Doc Severinsen, "Don't Knock the Clas- sics," Modern Hi Fi and Stereo Guide (January 1967), p. 33. as the blind men had difficulty de- scribing the elephant, musicians have found it hard to describe the music program. Some musicians think general music is not the trunk but the other end of the elephant, if one may be allowed to change metaphors in the middle of a stream. Robert Marsh, in his letter to me, wrote, "Many people I have met with music education skills are musical incompetents, literally teaching how to 'appreciate' an art they are unqualified to practice in any reasonable professional form." James Aliferis' study supports this criticism. He states that music edu- cation students are the poorest products of college and university music departments.16 It is difficult to separate teaching methods and competent teaching. Many music teachers, in areas other than music education, maintain that making music is the essential pre- lude to musical understanding. If so, it would seem that general music instruction should include a great deal more instruction in class "James Aliferis, "Diagnosis of a Profes- sion," Music Educators Journal, Vol. 55 (October 1968), p. 63. piano, recorder, percussion, and folk instruments than it does now. Competent teachers would, of course, need preparation to teach tiese skills. Obviously, music edu- cators need to give a great deal more attention to the problems of general music and the preparation of teachers who can achieve its desired aims. Since composers, critics, and per- formers are such strong advocates of learning through performing, it is possible that music educators should reconsider the role of per- formance in general music. Paul Hindemith and Leonard Bernstein expressed similar opin- ions on the weakening results of a musical environment saturated by a "tremendous sewage system of sound." Hindemith, in A Compos- er's World, believed the remedy would be to "augment the one per- cent of amateurs to a more respect- able size. Instead, our musical education is almost exclusively con- cerned with the professionals' four percent. . . . Amateur's music is essentially community music ....

Bernstein also thinks we hear too much music. In The Infinite Variety of Music, he writes, "Music is hard. It's not easy to listen to a piece of music and really know and feel what's going on in it all the time. . .. People don't know what they are missing. . . . After all, almost nobody can read music. ... It is the key to the personal experience, the first-hand, active musical ex- perience. Nothing can do so much for musical understanding as sit- ting down and playing music your- self. ... Music in the home ... not just listening to the phonograph but making music . . . is perhaps the chief essential for a 'cultured' mu- sical community." In a letter to the author, music critic Winthrop Sargeant agrees: Fifty years ago, although there was less music reaching fewer people in this coun- try, there was, I think, a higher apprecia- tion of music. It came because, among educated people, nearly every child learned, expertly or not, to play the piano, and four-hand arrangements of sympho- nies were at least puzzled over, and some- times played with pleasure. The amateurs who accomplished this were musically "literate." They knew things about the structure of music that today's passive phonographic listeners will never know, because music was for them a fascinating structural process that could be observed and checked on paper, as well as being listened to. Roger Sessions, discussing the listener in The Musical Experience of Composer, Performer, Listener, says: I am somewhat skeptical of the helpful- ness of the kind of technical tid-bits and quasi-analyses sometimes offered to the listener as aids to understanding .. The listener's real and ultimate response to music consists not in merely hearing it, but in inwardly reproducing it, and his understanding of music consists in the ability to do this in his imagination. Ralph Vaughan Williams, in Na- tional Music and Other Essays, said performance aids musical under- standing: Will not all this listening to superb, ex- pert performances bring on a counsel of despair in the mind of the humble ama- teur, who, for example, plays the flute a little for his own amusement? Will he not feel inclined to say, "With my limited capacities, my small opportunities for practice, I cannot hope to approach the perfection which I hear. Better to give up the struggle and become a merely passive listener." If our amateur flutist thinks thus, he will have lost one of the greatest assets of his spiritual life, the vision of the ultimate realities through the making of music. Gustav Hoist said that if a thing is worth doing at all, it is worth doing badly, and it would seem that the thousands of youngsters who buy guitars and drums to make their own music are in full agree- ment. But the point is that these youngsters are interested in doing something beyond "just listening" to music. The fourth problem, determining the effects of music education, has led to research findings indicating near total failure for music educa- tion. This research ignores the suc- cesses of many fine performing groups and the possibility that years of emphasis on folk music has produced a part of what is best in today's popular music. Such a dis- crepancy suggests at least four cau- APIL N - --.NY NEW FOR CONCERT BAND GRANDIOSO, CONCERT VERSION- Seitz/A. Reed ......................$12.50 YOUNG AMERICA SUITE-A.

Too many consumers expect research to provide money- back guarantees for teaching meth- ods, materials, and evaluative tools. (b) Research is too often general rather than local. The responsibility for research cannot be shifted en- tirely to large university centers. It needs to be conducted by local practitioners on questions related to the specifics of local situations. (c) All research findings must be tempered by judgment, espe- cially research in music and, even more particularly, research involv- ing musical taste and discrimina- tion. (d) We need to remember that educational research deals with formal education, an influence that John Dewey, in Democracy in Edu- cation, believed to be a "rather su- perficial" means of modifying human behavior. Thus, discoveries about the general level of musical- ity in our population cannot be associated directly with the results of school music instruction. Like the poor and the common cold, doublethink will be with us always. Nevertheless, there are ways in which we might alleviate some symptoms of doublethink. First, the MENC should make it clear that music specialists are needed in every school to teach music. Music educators have whim- pered a bit about musical short- comings among classroom teachers, but most recommendations for up- grading have dealt with an added hour or two in basic music for the college elementary education major. In fact, requiring elementary education majors to study "basic music" suggests a tacit approval by music educators of the deplorable incompetencies being perpetuated in the schools. Second, the MENC should rec- ognize the undisputed contribu- tions to music education made by the minority of classroom teachers possessing real musical competen- cies. Such recognition could take the form of specific certification in music after completing college and demonstrating the ability to play the piano and other instruments, and to meet other established standards. Third, the notion that anyone can take "basic music" for a semes- I WANT TO QUIT! What do parents do when those words are uttered fiercely by their budding musician off- spring?

Many elementary educa- tion majors lack talent and interest inrr music, and required hours of practice on "Twinkle, Twinkle, Lit- tle Star" in three keys will not conceal their dread and helpless- ness as music teachers in the ele- mentary school. Elementary music teaching ought to be an elective minor or concentration for musi- cally talented students majoring in elementary education. Fourth, general music teachers need special training. The gradual recognition of this need by some colleges is encouraging. A danger exists, however, that students un- able to meet musical requirements in other branches of college music will become the future general music specialists, thus aggravating the already shaky condition of the general music program. Fifth, the scope of music used in the schools needs to be widened. The great difficulty in teaching cur- rent popular music is that hit songs have short lives. Publishers of basic music series cannot afford to in- clude such music in their books, but it might be economically feasi- ble to publish educational editions of some hits in a yearly subscription series. Such a publishing venture could help to bridge the generation gap between "Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes" and the music of Blood, Sweat and Tears. Sixth, general agreement to place greater emphasis on developing music skills through expanded use of class piano, percussion, recorder, and folk instruments in general music might help to enlist greater support from band, orchestra, and choral directors who would see more relevance in such a program. Seventh, remembering the large proportion of young people now at- tending college would bring reali- zation of the significance of college instruction in music for nonmusic majors. Too many researchers and critics of music education ignore the role of college music literature courses, with the result that at- tempts are made to inflict methods intended for college students on squirming junior high school stu- dents. The results of continued efforts to determine our goals and reach them should bring more satisfaction to future teachers and students. ! MUSIC EDUCATORS JOURNAL I 114</page></plain_text>
