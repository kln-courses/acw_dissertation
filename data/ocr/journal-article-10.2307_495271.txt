<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Matrix of Lyric Transformation: Poetic Modes and Self-Presentation in Early Chinese Pentasyllabic Poetry, by Zong-qi Cai. Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, University of Michigan, 1996. Pp. 259 + notes, bibliography, glossary of Chinese characters, index. This is a lucid study of pentasyllabic poetry (wuyanshi Ti ) from its nascent stage in Eastern Han (25-220) to its full-fledged maturity in Western Jin Dynasty (265-316). Its main argument, to quote the author's words, is to demonstrate the "continual interaction between the thrust of self-presentation and the limitations of existent poetic modes that constitutes the very matrix of the transformation of early Chinese pentasyllabic poetry" (p. 5). To show the increasing personal and lyrical tendency of this process, the author identifies four distinct modes of self-presentation, the dramatic, the narrative, the lyrical, and the symbolic, as represented respectively by four groups of works, the Han yuefu (music bureau poetry), the Han gushi (ancient style poetry), the works of Cao Zhi (192-232), and Ruan Ji P F (210-63). Chapter One "An Overview: Pentasyllabic Poetry from the First to the Third</page><page sequence="2">192 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 20 (1998) Century" offers a brief survey of the metric rules of pentasyllabic poetry and its development from the first to the third century. Here Cai outlines his plan to trace the thematic, formal and generic changes of this poetic form in conjunction with the emergence of the four aforementioned modes. The book then moves into an exhaustive examination of Han yuefu in Chapter Two, "Han Yue-fu: Dramatic and Narrative Modes." As Cai indicates through his extensive citations, Han yuefu is a subject that has received a great deal of critical attention both in ancient and modern times, and from scholars both in and outside China. Through his excellent grasp of yuefu scholarship, Cai forges new approaches toward many thorny issues in yuefu studies. For example, while accepting the distinction between folk and literati yuefu made by modem scholars like Luo Genze, he proposes to make such distinction not "on the basis of anonymity and identifiable authorship, rather on the basis of their intrinsic qualities" (p. 27). Such intrinsic criteria enable him to identify some crucial formal qualities in Han yuefu, such as dramatic situations, ahistorical presentation, abrupt transitions, and composite structure in folk yuefu, and sequential structure, dual points of view in literati yuefu. Through close analysis of these qualities in well-known pieces of this genre, such as "Mulberry along the Lane" _il , and "Ballad of Watering Horses at a Long Wall Hole" ,5~', Cai demonstrates convincingly that folk yuefu comprise a collective composition and performance, thus representing the dramatic mode, whereas literati yuefu comprise a form of noninteractive storytelling and thus representing the narrative mode. The formal changes that occurred at this stage, especially the development from composite structure to sequential structure, and the transition from multiple points of view to dual points of view, are the results of literati poets' efforts to control and refine the folk yuefu poems. According to Cai, this transition from the dramatic to the narrative marks the first step in the evolution of pentasyllabic poetry toward an inward treatment of poetic experience, although literati yuefu is still performed in front of an external audience. This inward turn becomes more obvious in "Nineteen Ancient-Style Poems" -,PA , where the performative elements have all but disappeared, as the poets look inside their hearts and lament over human transience. In Chapter Three, "Han Ku-shih: The Emergence of the Lyrical Mode," Cai, following the conventional opinion, points out that this brooding over human transience is the dominant motif in this group of poems. He suggests that because it transcends concrete situations which often serve as a narrative context in yuefu, this motif is a fitting subject for lyrical expression, because what is foregrounded here is not event, but the poets' emotional responses. As is shown by Cai's comparative analysis of yuefu and gushi, with such shift of focus the sequential structure in the former is replaced by binary structure in the latter, which is a "merging of the yue-fu narrative tradition and the lyrical tradition of the Book of Poetry" (p. 79). In this structure the poets first describe a scene, and then reflect on their emotions aroused by such description. Cai's discussion of poetic texture in this chapter deserves special attention because it demonstrates his remarkable ability to use Western rhetorical analysis to support his general thesis and shed light on our understanding of Chinese poetry and literary criticism. This eschews the often intuitive</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 193 and mysterious impressionism that marks the traditional Chinese literary criticism; the following observation made by Fang Dongshu (1772-1851) about "Nineteen Ancient- Style Poems" is a good illustration of this characteristic: When these ancient people wrote, if there was a forward movement there must have been a backward movement; if there was a thrust downward there must be a thrust backward. To soar like a startled wild goose or to wind along like a swimming dragon: this is the way we follow their rules of composition and the way we seek to understanding their meaning. Having grasped this point, we will understand why these poems are thought to be seamless like clothes made by heaven" (quoted and translated in Cai, p. 92) Remarks like this are the hardest to analyze and explain because they appeal mostly to our senses, not our intellect; therefore the "rules of composition" that Fang refers to remain tantalizingly elusive. However, by looking closely at the structure and texture of the poems, Cai is able to help us understand on specific terms that what Fang refers to is actually "two aesthetic movements-the thrust of temporal imagination led by devices like rhetorical questions and linking couplets and the counterthrust of spatial imagination aided by devices like 'verse eye' and metaphoric resonance" (p. 92). Chapter Four, "Ts'ao Chi: The Development of the Lyrical Mode" aims to show how the lyrical mode of self-presentation established in the "Nineteen Ancient-Style Poems" is further refined in the hands of Cao Zhi, who is one of "the first Chinese pentasyllabic poets to step out of anonymity and make his own individual life the center of his poetic compositions" (p. 95). Because we have a relatively detailed knowledge about Cao Zhi's life, and because Cao Zhi often refers to specific events of his life in his poems, Chinese scholars have tried to view his works as a faithful record of his life and to provide a biographical account of every poem. This elicited a reaction from Western scholars like Hans Frankel, who, influenced by New Criticism, tried to exclude biographical information from the study of Cao Zhi's works. Cai disputes these two approaches, and proposes instead to examine the dynamic relationship between Ts'ao Chih's life and poetical works in terms of his life-long process of self-transformation and generic transformation. How for instance, does the poet blend his changing sentiment with the feelings customarily expressed in early ku-shih to transform his experiential self into an appealing poetic self? How does he cast himself in conventional poetic roles (the abandoned wife, the wanderer, the anthropomorphic object, etc.), identifying their stories with his own experience and conveying his complex feelings about his close friends, his brother Ts'ao P'i, his other brothers and nephew?" (103) This approach proves to be very fruitful because it enables Cai to combine historical and biographical information of Cao Zhi's life with formal analysis of his poetry. For example, Cai's analysis of Cao Zhi's use of abandoned wife (qifu ) and wanderer</page><page sequence="4">194 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 20 (1998) (youzi -l#), the two conventional personae in Han gushi, demonstrates how adroitly Cao Zhi manipulates this formal feature to reflect the changes in his own life, so that the sorrow we find in his "Beautiful Woman" -- can be read as a "reflection of his sorrow over his estrangement from the emperor, his brother Ts'ao P'i" (1278). Thus, the multi-faceted self in Cao Zhi's pentasyllabic poetry is formed through his innovative adoption of earlier conventions in this genre. Cao Zhi not merely broadens the scope of pentasyllabic poetry (he introduced the zengda PV , or the poetry of presentation into it), but also lyricized and personalized its every sub-genre, particularly yuefu and gushi. Cai's discussion in this chapter also shows that historical and biographical information can be relevant and helpful to our understanding of the poems in question, but it has to be used prudently and together with a sensitive, focused formal analysis. In Chapter Five, "Juan Chi: the Formation of the Symbolic Mode," Cai attempts to show that Ruan Ji's pentasyllabic poetry, in its "use of poetic images represents a radical departure from the poetic conventions of his time" (p. 187). This is so because in Ruan Ji's poems the images have been pruned of their referential function and serve as "coordinates of human frailty" that are organized by the poet "into a mental landscape that suggests no real locale" (p. 156). Thus, in Ruan Ji's eighty-two yonghuaishi 9'[94 or "Poems Expressing My Feelings" the pentasyllabic poetry has reached an introspective level unknown before. Cai claims that traditional criticism, which is characterized by its search for fixed meaning in the texts, political allegorization, ideological categorization, and generic anatomy, is ill-equipped to study Ruan Ji's poetry. Instead, Cai suggests, we should "seek to come to terms with his propensity for contradictions in the realm of action and to show how he communicates his innermost thoughts through a deft exploitation of indeterminacy in imagery, structure, and allusion" (p. 149). He begins by a brief introduction of the poet's life, to show how Ruan Ji's predilection for poetic indeterminacy is deeply rooted in his life and time, which is one of the most chaotic and dangerous periods of Chinese history. Then Cai proceeds to analyze the symbolic nature of Ruan Ji's pentasyllabic poems "in the light of his exploitation of indeterminacy on the levels of poetic imagery, structure, and intertextual relationship" (p. 155). Cai divides Ran Ji's poetic imagery into four kinds and calls them "coordinates of human frailty." They are "its projection onto temporal aspects of nature and onto the life of plants and animals, as well as its manifestation in the physical conditions and the emotional life of man" (p. 157). In structure Cai identifies two major innovations in Ruan Ji's poetry: cyclical structure and discontinuous structure. The nonlinear nature of the former contrasts with the linear structure found in "Nineteen Ancient-Style Poems," and the latter serves as a helpful device for the poet's intense mental reflection. Both mark the further lyricization of pentasyllabic poetry because they minimize narrative elements in the poetry. In commenting on the intertextual nature of Ruan Ji's poetry Cai identifies four types of allusions: textual allusion, textual-historical allusion, historical allusion, and historical-textual allusion, and aims to show through his analysis that this "dexterous interweaving of allusions intensifies the play of indeterminacy and generates four kinds of aesthetic responses: multiplication of imagistic association</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 195 in his textual allusion, interplay of literal scene and imaginary vision in textual-historical allusions, simple substitution of historical figures or events for abstract concepts in historical allusions, and evocation of conflicting thoughts and sentiments in historical- textual allusions" (p. 175). The intense formal scrutiny that yielded many exciting results in the previous chapters (especially Chapters Two and Three), unfortunately, is not fully matched in this chapter precisely as the texts become richer and more complex. Cai seems to rely more on assertion than on a close analysis of images. For example, his treatment of the following poem is somewhat thin and disappointing: *f - -The hibiscus flowers blossom on the rolling graves, SAM) ?

(quoted and translated in Cai, p. 158, with my modifications) In commenting on this imagistically rich and complex poem Cai merely observes that Ruan Ji contemplates human frailty through living things. These plant and animal images signify the impermanence of all living forms, including human beings. The inevitable dissolution of the human frame into nothingness makes all worldly pursuits trivial and pitiful. All human glories are, like the scintillating brilliance of hibiscus, gone only too soon. All human pleasures and freedom are, like the joys of crickets and cicadas, soon played out. (p. 158) It is certainly true that this is a poem of transience and death par excellence, but what is significant is the highly aesthetic style that the poet adopts to treat this very conventional topic. By Cai's terminology the structure of the poem might be called binary, which is the most prominent structure in "Nineteen Ancient-Style Poems." Except for the last two lines that bring in the poet's reflection, the entire poem consists of images that are traditionally associated with the transience of human life. This seems to challenge Cai's assertion that Ruan Ji's use of poetic imagery represents a</page><page sequence="6">196 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 20 (1998) radical departure from the poetic convention of the time.' The tone of the poem is made clear in the opening couplet, for the short-lived hibiscus flowers are presented as blooming in the midst of graveyards. Beauty and death are therefore juxtaposed, but in this juxtaposition the balance seems to be tilting toward beauty, because in the second line the poem adopts a resonant doublet to depict the flowers, huanghuang )t ), "brilliant" and "luminous." These flowers, even in their death, retain their grace, because in the next two lines we are asked to view them as they decay together with the bright setting sun, and another highly poetic doublet pianpian AR, "lithely," "elegantly," is used to portray their fall. This rhetorical gesture to aestheticize the otherwise heart-rending decline in the natural world is carried on in the next six lines. In this doubly sad moment it is an evening in Autumn, both of which are associated with death the crickets, cicadas and ephemerides are all trying their utmost to live their lives. Especially noticeable are words and phrases used to describe the ephemerides: they are shown to be wan RL (playing) for their brief moment in this world, they are xiu fl (preening) their wings, and they are even shoushi 41t (bedecking) their brief time. In the last two lines the poet speaks in his own voice the lesson he has drawn from the previous part of the poem: that we all know our life is as ephemeral as the ephemerides, declining sun, and Autumn cricket, but, like theirs, our life is also not without its beauty; consequently we must try our very best to live it, and live it with the same kind of beauty and grace found in the aforementioned plants and insects. The strong aesthetic qualities of the poem, together with the phrase kangkai WW'5 in the last line, which was used by Cao Zhi and translated by Cai as "heroic lamentation" (p. 129) in that context, effectively cancel out the gloom that we find in "Nineteen Ancient- Style Poems" and some other pieces by Ruan Ji. He is not merely lamenting the transience of human life, but also celebrating its intense, albeit brief beauty and elegance. It must be these qualities that prompted a contemporary Chinese critic to claim that "no one has ever expressed so profoundly and so beautifully the intense sorrows of political persecution."22 An in-depth reading like this would have demonstrated that even in treating a conventional and constant theme like transience and death, Ruan Ji's imagery creates indeterminate resonances, and this in turn would have demonstrated that Ruan Ji's "propensity for contradictions" are not confined to the "realm of action" alone; they are equally strong in his poetry and therefore should not be explained away by the urge for unity and fixed meaning in traditional criticism. This is precisely what Cai argues for in this chapter. All this, however, is only a minor quibble, especially in light of the remarkable 'Various traditional and modern critics have pointed out the links between Ruan Ji's poetry and poetic conventions. Zhong Rong M3 (d. ?518) traced his style to the xiaoya IJ\ft section of Shijing , while others have chosen to emphasize his connections with Zhuangzi Ef_- and Qu Yuan's RJ "Lisao" 4 R; see Chen Yanjie P{{_ ed., Shipin zhu a, (Beijing: Renmin wenxue, 1958), 14-15. In her The Reading of Imagery in the Chinese Poetic Tradition (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987), Pauline Yu observes that both Ruan Ji's poetry and the "Nineteen Ancient-Style Poems" "employ the stock, emblematic, and structurally isolated imagery that for many critics represents the bing xing tradition derived from the Classic of Poetry" (136). 2Li Zehou $2 , Mei de licheng 1 F)fM (Beijing: Wenwu, 1981), 103.</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 197 achievement of the book: its author has mapped out, again in lucid terms, the evolution of pentasyllabic poetry from its nascent stage to its maturity and its increasing lyrical tendency in this process. Cai's formal analysis and conceptual framework enable us to see the different stages of such evolution in concrete, specific terms. This alone is a significant contribution to the field.
