<plain_text><page sequence="1">Popular pujas in public places: Lay rituals in South Indian temples Sita Anantha Raman RELIGIOUS INTERFACE: LAY AND ?GAMA P?J?S If the leitmotif of all spiritual exploration is a mystical 'obligation, bond, rever ence/ the actual practice of religion has largely entailed physical transactions defined by geographical realities. Hindu bhakti p?j?s (devotional rituals) thus synthesize the mundane and spiritual, the concrete and abstract elements of worship, through substantive rites to finite symbols that are located within the discrete boundaries of natural or constructed shrines (Hardy 1994; Kramrisch 1981; Shulman 1980). These iconic p?j?s are either of the local lay variety, or they are complex, priestly temple rituals based on classical Sanskrit or Agamic liturgies. The three broad ?gama schools advocate the worship of immanent Visnu, Siva, and the goddess Dev?/Sakti as the transcendent Supreme (Bhatt 1984; Matsubara 1994; Varadachari 1988). ?gama liturgies are integral to the consecration of Hindu shrines and icons (Pauskara Samhit? chapters 2-4; Filliozat 1994; Smith 1984; Venkatachari 1984) and for the daily or festival rituals conducted to the deified icon (area) in the temple sanctum, the garbha grha or 'womb house/ Although some early ?gama schools of Vaisnava theology allowed initiated non-Br?hmanas to perform rites, eventually only Br?hmana priests were allowed to conduct rituals to the area in the garbhagrha. This paper presents field evidence of a type of modern interface between lay or popular p?j?s and priestly ?gama p?j?s in Tamil Hindu temples dating from premodern times (Balasubrahmanyam 1975; Das 1991; Paramasivanandam 1973; Rajagopalan 1981). Most of these temples had Br?hmana priests, and they were constructed by rulers during the bhakti movement in honor of Siva, Visnu, and Amman/Devi (Hardy 1983; Hawley 1996; Kinsley 1988; Yocum 1982).' International Journal of Hindu Studies 5, 2 (August 2001 ): 165-98 ? 2003 by the World Heritage Press Inc.</page><page sequence="2">166 / Sita Anantha Raman Folk temples of considerable sanctity with non-Br?hmana priests were dedicated to Amman alone or with her consort Siva.2 The agents of interface today are the general populace, whom 1 define as the lay folk and the 'subaltern' jana who comprise a cross section of South Indian castes, classes, and ethnolinguisitic groups. While the term 'subaltern' usually connotes a spectrum of politically and socially marginalized groups (Guha 1982; Hardiman 1998), in this paper 'folk' and 'jana1 will refer only to those with little or no access to institu tionalized religious power. The jana thus consists largely of lay worshipers, but I also include minor temple priests and petty officials who do not control the performance of ?gama rites in the sanctum, which is the domain of the most orthodox priests. While today devotees of all castes can commission priests to perform ?gama p?j?s in their names, they cannot personally conduct these rites even if they are Br?hmanas. Similarly, while minor priests in the large temples are also Br?hmanas, they are peripheral to the sanctum rites. Finally, although petty officials of various castes maintain records and wield some form of political power, they do not contribute to the shrine's mystique and have no sway over its ?gama p?j?s. Today devotees from the jana can be seen performing specific, substantive p?j?s to minor images that are carved profusely on Tamil temple pillars, walls, and niches. In lay p?j?s, devotees bypass priestly intercession and utter sponta neous prayers in Tamil, Sanskrit, or other languages. Their ritual sites are largely panels that are accessibly located in the entrance hall (mandapa), but sometimes devotees perform rites to images on the pillars in the 'half-hall,' or ardha mandapa, that is adjacent to the garbhagrha. Devotees anoint their favorite images with butter, oil, or red turmeric (kuhkumam) and offer such elements as fruits, flowers, and turmeric in pujas that resemble priestly ?gama p?j?s conducted in the garbhagrha. While several divinities are so honored, some of the most popular are local and Sanskritic manifestations of Amman, theriomorphic beings like ?ncaneyar/ Hanum?n from the R?m?yana, and lower-caste medieval bhakti n?yan?rs (saints) like Kannappa, the aboriginal hunter. The devotees* folk status is apparent in their veneration of the hunter whose eye sacrifice to Siva was lauded by medieval high-caste saints, like Cuntaram?rti and M?nikkav?cakar, and by Cekkil?r who recorded his legend in the hagiographical Periya Pur?nam (Vanmikanathan 1985; Yocum 1982; Zvelebil 1991). At first glance, these modem lay rites at pillars and niches appear to mimic the complex ?gama rituals with Sanskrit liturgies performed by the priests. These ?gama rites are snapana/abhiseka, in which priests anoint the free-standing area with substances, and arcana, in which the priest offers fruits, flowers, red turmeric, and sacred ash or vibh?ti (Courtright 1985; Narayanan 1985; Preston</page><page sequence="3">Lay rituals in South Indian temples I 167 1985). However, despite the appearance of a downward filtering of elite theologies, I suggest that these specific ?gama p?j?s probably originated in autochthonous Dravidian-aboriginal folk rites of ablution and offering (p?cai/ taivaral) at tree-pillar and memorial-pillar (natukal) shrines (Amrithalingam 1998; Hart 1975a; Meister 1983; Sivaram 1994). While it is difficult to trace the nebulous origins of all Hindu substantive p?j?s, Rg Vedic religion centered on aniconic fire sacrifice, and this earliest Sanskrit corpus of texts does not refer to rites of ablution and offerings to images. However, Tamil texts from the Cankarn era (200 BCE-500 CE) describe Dravidian-aboriginal tree and memorial shrines where devotees performed substantive rites to natural divinities whom they sometimes invoked through images (Akan?n?ru. 22.167; Cilappatik?ram 1.5.167-68, 172). These pre-Sanskritic rituals were part of a pan-Indian 'folk religion' that lies at the base of Hinduism (Hardy 1983). This paper demonstrates that in South India today, devotees continue to perform some residual, pre-?ryan p?j?s of ablution and offering at trees and natukal whose sacrality was established in a pre-historical era. Early shrines were probably constructed first aroand trees to locate divinity permanently on earth (Hardy 1994) or to serve as an axis mundi, bringing order to an otherwise chaotic universe (Shulman 1980), The first part of the paper examines the phenomenon of modern lay rites in the public arena. It also places the evidence in a theoretical framework in order to study the processes of cultural transmission and interface between the folk and the elite in India. It suggests that there has been a seminal but often unacknowledged non-?ryan imprint on Sanskritic Hinduism. Over the millen nia, India's religious tapestry has dynamically sustained the tight intermeshing of various threads of ideology and practice. Innovation, adoption, and synthesis have woven into the fabric new variants of earlier designs that have endowed the phenomenon of religion in India with a unique texture. One of its key features has been a reciprocal cultural transfusion whenever elite textual precepts and practices have confronted the power of popular worship (Coburn 1997; Hardy 1983). This interactive relationship between the complex categories of textual and pan-Indian folk traditions was erroneously reduced by earlier scholars into a binary formula that equated the literate with the 'higher' Sanskritic/?ryan and the folk with the 'lesser' customary/Dravidian/aboriginal (Nilakanta Sastri 1963; Singer 1972; Srinivas 1966). This formula is questionable, as the nebulous term 'customary' applies equally to Vedic and non-Vedic traditions, which have been forged together through widespread, multifaceted genetic interactions. Further more, the Cankarn literary corpus and the complexities of India's Dravidian aboriginal substrata also preclude their essentialization as nonliterate, 'lesser traditions' (Hart 1975a, 1975b; Zvelebil 1973, 1991). While it is irrefutable that</page><page sequence="4">168 / Sita Anantha Raman Sanskritic nomenclature and norms have been historically assumed by vertically mobile groups, cultural immersion has thus been a multilateral process pene trating through what A. K. Ramanujan (1972) calls 'permeable membranes' intersecting caste whenever religions reconstituted themselves on the subconti nent (O'Flaherty 1985: 11). This interface has meant that elements of folk religion are echoed in Sanskritic theologies and that, occasionally, even non Hindu traditions exhibit features of Hindu bhakti p?j? at the level of lay belief and practice, despite the deep theological cleavages delineated by their disparate structural authorities (Bayly 1989; Navalar and Muhuideen 1996; Rao, Shulman, and Subrahmanyam 1998).3 The initial cultural and genetic exchanges between local Dravidian speakers and Sanskritic immigrants were bilateral and fairly egalitarian, but in the following centuries across India, the folk were marginalized socially and ritually when Br?hmana theologians subsumed and 'crystallized' folk myths and rituals into Sanskrit Hindu texts (Coburn 1997) with little acknowledgement of their plebian inspiration. In South India, Tamil kings now built large temples for Sanskritized local deities to include the denizens of their new territories; Br?hmanas presided over the consecrations of shrines and icons with ?gama liturgies that were perceived as divine emanations (Brown 1990; Champaka lakshmi 1996; Hazra 1975; Shulman 1980; Zvelebil 1973). ?gama ritualism was elevated to the highest form of Hinduism, while folk practices became peripheral. Moreover, earlier Dravidian notions of ritual pollution were also reified through Sanskritic caste hierarchies (Hart 1975a), and the lowest strata was excluded from performing personal rites in public temples However, this paper also demonstrates that, despite structural constraints, folk agency has been ongoing, subtle, and resilient and that what often passes for 'high' Hinduism has the indelible thumbprint of the lay creative impulse. This is seen in the continued popularity of the tree/rnemorial/temple pillars as lay ritual sites in India (Amrithalingam 1998; Malla 2000; Narayanan 1997). The deity's sacred tree (sthala vrksa) has been included in the temple environs (Sivaram 1994), while mixed-caste artisans carved popular legends on pillars resembling sacred tree sites (Natarajan and Kasinathan 1992). Today, the jana place votive offerings on the platforms of sthala vrksa and cradles on wayside banyan and pipala trees to stimulate the womb; they anoint temple frescoes of yaksl tree nymphs associated with fertility, figures who are reminiscent of early Buddhist yaks? images in North India. Finally, these apparently spontaneous, modern lay acts of reverence and other expressions of public religiosity have social implications today (Waghorne 2001). Since these lay p?j?s in the temple arena resemble important ?gama p?j?s, the jana is redefining the parameters of personal and public ritual space.</page><page sequence="5">Lay rituals in South Indian temples I 169 The climate is ripe today for this challenge to priestly prerogatives in a state where Dravidian consciousness has flourished noticeably ever since 1914, when Tamil rationalist leaders first attacked caste hierarchies and occupations (Barnett 1976; Irschick 1969; Ramasami 1983; Ramaswamy 1997; Richman 1991). These democratic ideologies have undermined general belief in caste immuta bility and possibly in karmic justice as a determinant of future temporal status. Thus, the Tamil jana's search for empowerment is manifest in improvised street shrines, large displays of lights and temple hoardings that encroach on public, municipal space. They remind us that these are primarily social rather than religious acts and a fresh watershed in an organic yet co-optive process of theological adoption, exclusion, contestation, and renewal in the region. MODERN LAY P?J?S, SITES, AND FAVORED GODS In today's interface, lay Tamil devotees do their private p?j?s most frequently to deities and medieval bhakti saints whose friezes are accessibly located on the middle and lower panels of temple pillars (stambhas), walls (prak?ras), and niches (kostas). Their favorite pillars are often located in the main entrance mandapa and sometimes in the inner ardha mandapa leading to the garbha grha (Balasubrahmanyam 1975; Meister 1983; Sivaramamurthi 1973). At almost all the sites, devotees offer spontaneous vernacular prayers and bhakti songs, light lamps and incense, and trace small good-luck designs (k?lam) of rice flour around the pillar base. They also smear their favorite minor pillar and wall images with butter, oil, curds, turmeric, and sandal wood and offer flowers, fruits, coconuts, sandal wood, and kuhkumam. While they worship several deities with ardor, lay devotees pay considerable attention to Amman in her many folk, Sanskritic, and integrated manifestations, both in temples with Br?hmana priests and in folk temples with non-Br?hmana priests. They also venerate lower-caste bhakti saints like Kannappa, theriomor phic gods like ?ncaneyar, the simian devotee of Visnu as R?ma, and Visnu's incarnation as a boar (Var?ha) or as the lion-faced Ugra-Narasimha. In the Tiruvanmiyur Marund?svarar temple, devotees frequently oil and garland the Kannappa legend that is depicted on the middle panel of the first pillar at the entrance. At Kumbakonam's R?masv?m? temple, the continuous burning of lamps and oil smearings have blackened the large frescoes of R?ma, S?t?, and Hanum?n on the third and fourth pillars in the mandapa at the entrance, and there are profuse tracings of k?lams on the panels and pillars. Lay devotees seem to favor Amman above all the divinities on the pillars and</page><page sequence="6">170 / Sita Anantha Raman niches of temples. She is venerated in her powerful and gentle forms with lamps and k?lams, anointed with oil, garlanded with yellow, red, or white flowers, and draped in red or green skirts and sar?s. For example, at Tenkasi's K?s? Visva n?tha temple, devotees venerate Amman as K?l? in the main mandapa. They oil, garland, and drape a red skirt around a prominent image on the middle panel of a large corner pillar. When 1 visited the temple, someone had also painted the wall above in yellow so that it seemed smeared by turmeric and drawn k?lams at the pillar's base. At Sankara-N?r?yana temple, devotees seem to favor a vibrant figure of a six-armed dancing (tillai) K?l? located in a niche on the north wall of the large garbhagrha. On two separate visits, I noted that the image of Tillai K?l? was heavily anointed with oil and that there were k?lams of rice flour and kuhkumam. J also observed a woman place flowers beside Kali's feet while praying in Tamil. On festival days at Tiruvanmiyur, local women trace k?lams across the floor of the main mandapa, but individual devotees also trace k?lams around their favorite pillar images. Here and at Tiruvarur, they have adorned Kam?ks? Amman in bright saris. At Darasuram, the Durg? image in an alcove was marked by kuhkumam. She was draped in a red sari, and someone had placed a small clump of white flowers on her head. Laksm? is also a perennial favorite in her several forms. These include a popular oiled image of Gajalaksm? in a dark corner niche of the separate shrine to K?ntimati Amman in Tirunelveli temple, a frieze of Laksm? with Var?ha-Visnu in the mandapa at Kumbakonam R?masv?rm temple, Laksm? seated on the lap of Ugra-Narasimhan in Srivilli puttur, and a large frieze of S?ta by herself and with R?ma in the entrance mandapa at Kumbanonam. Devotees favored highly visible or accessible images but occasionally also those in recessed alcoves and on lower panels. There were some differences and similarities among lay rituals in temples with Br?hmana priests and folk temples with non-Br?hmana priests (or no priests) but whose devotees stem largely from the nonelite Tamil castes. Simply constructed tree shrines for Amman usually do not have a resident priest, and lay autonomy over rites appears to be greater than in urban temples. This is seen in the undated tree shrine to Marutamaram Pey?cci Amman at Kazhugu Malai, on whose peak there is a larger shrine to the goddess. At the tree shrine, worshipers had freely garlanded and oiled the inside image and the tree itself. In larger urban folk temples, the devotee's role is subsidiary to that of the priests. Melmutt?r Amman temple in Tenkasi was built about four hundred and fifty years ago by a flower-seller named Manjanaiyikka Akhil?ntamman on land donated by a Naidu couple. Its non-Br?hmana priests allow lay worshipers to oil, garland, and drape sar?s around the pillar images of the founder saint devotee and the original Naidu donors. The pillar had been painted a bright yellow, resembling the smearing of turmeric. Tenkasi's modern Cirrarruv?ri</page><page sequence="7">Lay rituals in South Indian temples I 171 Amman temple also has a non-Br?hmana priesthood, but its main icons of Amman and Siva as Cutalai M?tan had been formally consecrated by a Br?hmana priest through ?gama rites. Behind Siva's anthropomorphic image was a natukal representing the archaic natukal form of the god. While lay devotees do not anoint these main images, they had smeared the pillar image of the original cittaryog? with kuhkumam and traced a small k?lam. Lamps were lit around the yogf s grave in a back room of the temple. In temples with Br?hmana priests, devotees appear unconsciously to be imitating the priests' ?gama rites of snapana/abhiseka and arcana to the areas in the sanctum. They are probably not aware of the intricacies of archaic Tamil rituals as described in Cankarn texts, and it is entirely possible that they are replicating ?gama ceremonies. However, by conducting their lay p?j?s in the Br?hmana's sacred terrain, they are effectively remapping the boundaries between ?gama and personal p?j?s. Ever since 1914, when E. V. Ramasami first attacked Sanskritic Hinduism, its rituals and gods as tools to dominate the southern regions, the inhabitants of Tamilnadu have grown accustomed to anti Br?hmanical rhetoric and public denunciations of hereditary caste. Yet, Br?hmana monopoly over ?gama rituals continues even today in major temples with large endowments and extends over some folk temples with non-Br?hmana priests. For example, Sankara Pandiyan Pillai, the non-Br?hmana priest of Cirrarruv?ri Amman K?vil in Tenkasi, informed me that a Br?hmana had been called to consecrate the icons, a move that brought more upper-caste devotees to the shrine. In this climate of Br?hmanical control over public rituals, it is quite remarkable that the jana feel empowered to perform personal p?j?s in the public temple without priestly intermediaries. Such lay acts effectively undermine the problematic eschatology of karma as a postmortem determinant of social status, although the ancient doctrine will probably continue to provide psychological comfort to troubled devotees for a long time. While modern devotees focus on pillars near the entrance, occasionally, as at Azhvar Tirunagari and Srivilliputtur, they also anoint pillars in the ardha mandapa adjacent to the garbhagrha. Ironically, minor priests and supervisory officials appear to empathize with the lay worshipers as they, too, constitute the jana because they do not control the ?gamas in the garbhagrha, the domain of the most orthodox priestly echelons. As many minor priests are impoverished, they identify with lower-class devotees, their rites, and their bhakti. Frequently, they welcome small pecuniary benefits for special services and serve as guides and explain the temple myths for a small fee. At Kumbakonam, a minor priest directed me to flower and coconut vendors who largely catered to worshipers of pillar images, perhaps since he received a small commission from the sales. Occasionally such priests also help to procure flowers and other items for the</page><page sequence="8">172 / Sita Anantha Raman devotees' p?j?s at the pillars. One priest even volunteered to perform a special arcana to the large friezes of R?ma and S?ta in an attempt to co-opt the lay ritual with his greater fund of Sanskrit prayers. By and large, however, I encountered priestly support for the lay devotee. Thus, at Darasuram, when I pointed to kuhkumam powder at the base of a high-niched Amman image, our Br?hmana guide, whose emaciation indicated his own subaltern identity, reverentially informed me that 'such was the power of the jana1 s bhakti9 (itu tan janahkalota bhakti) that they had climbed the wall to venerate the image. The priests generally refrain from interfering in commonplace acts that do not threaten the ?gama rituals in the garbhagrha. However, they would probably object strenuously if devotees attempted to anoint the areas inside the sanctum. Temple authorities even facilitate lay worship, especially of Amman. In Kam?ks? Amman temple in Tiruvarur, they had built steps to an inaccessible but favored image on the inner prak?ra. At the national monument in Darasuram, priests had arranged to provide an electric bulb for a popular niched image of Durg? whom devotees had dressed in a red sar? and decorated with a wreath on her head. Tiruvanmiyur's officials added a protective railing enclosing a popular pillar image of Kam?ks? Amman so that this has become a mini-shrine inside the main temple. Tamil temples are rich in legends from the R?m?yana, Mah?bh?rata, the Pur?nas, and the hagiographies of Vaisnava and Saiva bhakti saints. Many medieval sculptors stemmed from the mixed castes of anulomas (hypergamy) and pratilomas (hypogamy) who drew inspiration from two cultures and languages. This is evident from their copper and stone inscriptions in Tamil and Sanskrit (Subrahmanian and Venkataraman 1980; Varadarajan I988).4 Carved with power and delicate precision, the friezes reveal their empathy for early low caste saints like Kannappa. In the ninth century, the Saiva saints Cuntaram?rti and M?nikkav?cakar praised this early aboriginal hunter-saint, whose acts were also recorded in the twelfth century by Cekkil?r. The legend states that Kannappa's meat offerings were rejected as ritual pollution by a Br?hmana priest. However, Siva's grief at this exclusion caused his eyes on the Ungarn to bleed, whereupon Kannappa stanched its flow by gouging out his own. The Tiruvanmiyur temple is located on the outskirts of the town, and its proximity to lower-caste and working-class villages helps to explain Kannappa's popularity at this site. This pillar image is also conveniently carved on the middle panel of the first pillar near the entrance so that devotees easily and frequently smear it with water and oil and decorate it with kuhkumam, flowers, and k?lams. These are rituals by modern, working-class devotees to a marginalized hero from an earlier Tamil era. This indicates that their rites are not solely motivated by religious fervor, and they underscore the modern jana's dissatisfaction over</page><page sequence="9">Lay rituals in South Indian temples I 173 residual inequalities in an ostensibly democratic society. Similarly, modern devotees appear to take special pleasure in anointing A?can?yar with butter, sandalwood, and kuhkumam and in garlanding him with marigolds and red hibiscus. It is interesting to note that snapana and arcanas in the sanctum are made not only to the main deities (Courtright 1985; Narayanan 1985; Preston 1985; Smith 1984) but also to their retinue, human bhakti saints, and a theriomorphic devotee like A?can?yar, the monkey (vanara) (Varadachari 1988). To those who prefer an anthropomorphic vision of divinity, the Hindu fascination with this vanara may be incomprehensible. However, Hanum?n is the quintessential devotee (bhakta) of R?ma and his wise emissary (d?ta), valiant (v?ra) warrior, and regal (r?ja) minister. Most Hindus would agree that in the tiered relationship between mortals and divinity, bhakti accompanies submission (prapatti), and Hanum?n epitomizes a human, not simian, inner strength and plea for grace.5 Tamil mixed-caste sculptors were probably familiar with both V?lm?ki's original Sanskrit R?m?yana (Chaturvedi and Kunal 1996; Suman 1996) and Kampan's Tamil Ir?m?vat?ram (Aiyar 1965; Ramanujan 1991; Shulman 1991; Zvelebil 1975). The epic's popularity in South India may be of long-standing due to the tale of Hanum?n's stone bridge to Lanka. George Hart (1975a) believes that there was even an early Cankarn Tamil version that had inspired Kampan in the eleventh century. Certainly, Hanum?n plays a central role in both the Sanskrit and Tamil versions, as their Sundarak?ndas are devoted to the bhakta, while the Yuddhak?ndas contain his heroic narratives. The epic thus revolves almost as often on Hanum?n's feats as on R?ma's glory. Both poets describe him as the ideal devotee and the regal warrior. He is a strong-armed yogi (R?m?yana 5.1.180, 5.1.216), an eloquent v?nara (Ir?m?vat?ram 4.2.36 37), and the humorist who set fire to his tail before burning Lanka (R?m?yana 5.54.1-16); and he assumed a colossal form or visvar?pa (R?m?yana 5.1.13) yet shrank so that Sita would not fear him. In a legend that links disparate powers in nature, A?can?yar is described as the son of the wind-gods, the Maruts, who gave his seeded fruit to A?jana, the forest nymph (Shulman 1980). The friezes show him flying like the wind to resuscitate fallen heroes and lifting the mountain with the medicinal sanj?van? bush. This magnificent non-?ryan character is clearly about raw, elemental power, which may explain the popular fascination for him (Richman 1991; Zelliot 1996).6 The most commonly anointed images of A?can?yar are usually located in the main temple mandapas on the middle and lower panels of pillars. Thus, on the central panel of a large mandapa pillar in Tenkasi's K?si Visvan?tha temple, devotees had anointed the small image of A?can?yar standing humbly at R?ma's feet, his hands folded in salutation (a?jali pran?mukhah). Similar images of the</page><page sequence="10">174 / Sita Anantha Raman bhakta with folded hands received anointings and kuhkumam at Krishnapuram, Azhvar Tirunagari, and Tiruvanmiyur. At Sankara-N?r?yana temple, I also noted several rather spectacular lay rites to bhakta A?can?yar and v?ra A?can?yar on the first pillars of the ardha mandapa adjacent to the garbhagrha. The rite had been recently performed, since I observed white butter dripping from a flying v?ra A?can?yar whose curved tail had been freshly covered with sandalwood. The lay devotee had felt brave enough to conduct the rites close to the sanctum. This suggests that some lay worshipers feel empowered enough to assert their right to perform substantive p?j?s inside the public temple arena. The sanctum priests watched but refrained from interfering with the devotees. This was partly due to their impotence in stopping frequent lay rites just outside their jurisdiction and partly because they were cognizant of the auspicious nature of these acts. However, they would have certainly stopped worshipers from anointing the areas inside the sanctum. Similarly, in Srivilliputtur, devotees often anoint an image on the middle panel of the tiny ardha mandapa next to the goddess Laksm?-?ntal's shrine. Here a devotee had anointed A?can?yar the yog? (cittar) whose penances preceded his missions. The priests acknowledged the auspicious power of folk bhakti by including themselves in its mystique. They had strung a lamp above the image and offered kuhkumam to other devotees, but the substantive p?j?s had been clearly performed by an earlier devotee. Despite the well-defined spatial demarcations between lay and ?gama rites, these were clearly bold lay encroachments on priestly ritualism in this modern religious interface. EARLY RELIGIOUS INTERFACES IN INDIA: A BACKGROUND Interface has been perennial ever since Vedic aniconic religion was grafted onto a Dravidian-aboriginal matrix in India, after which time diverse groups have been forged together through cohabitation and cultural contacts that have crossed caste taboos.7 Stella Kramrisch (1981) and Glenn Yocum (1982) point to late Vedic-era (1000-300 BC) disparagement of non-?ryans as outcaste vrafyas (vow takers) or yogic shaman worshipers of the Ungarn (Rg Veda 10.136; Atharva Veda 15.5.1-7; Mah?bli?rata 5.35). However, Vedic texts (Rg Veda 5.2.6, 10.125; Svet?svatara Upanisad 6.1, 23; Taittiriya Upanisad 3.12-13) also record the adoption of non-?ryan immanent gods and yoga. Some non Br?hmana wheelwrights and hunters were initiated to perform certain Vedic sacrifices, although the orthodox initially refused such offerings (Varadachari</page><page sequence="11">Lay rituals in South Indian temples I 175 1988).8 In this early Hindu interface, while non-Sanskritic cultures were enhanced by Upanisadic affirmation of a transcendent Brahman behind multiple immanent gods, elite caste adoption of popular iconic p?j? rites to folk deities ensured their survival in Sanskritic Hinduism (Hart 1975a; Shulman 1980).9 This unusual interface of several theological strands is seen in texts from this era. In the Bhagavad G?ta (2, 8.21-22, 9.26, 18.78), an immanent Krsna, who is Visnu the 'pervader' of the universe, reveals himself as the transcendent, inner ?tman (antary?min) and cosmic Brahman. In the Mah?n?r?yana Upanisad, major ceremonial fire liturgies laud both yogic search for Brahman (6.1, 7.1, 12.15-17, 12.70, 33.1, 39.2, 79.18) and the worship of manifest Visnu (1.1-3, 12.13, 12.37, 13.4-6), Siva (74.1, 75.1), and Dev? (1.33, 1.36, 1.47-48, 2.2). Yocum (1982) and Maraimalai Jlakkuvanar (1998) accept a Dravidian origin for iconic, substantive p?j? rites and point to the absence of Vedic references to icons and to the enunciation of p?j? only in the Bhagavad G?ta (9.26). Here Krsna praises bhakti p?j? as the loving dedication of a flower or a leaf to deified icons, thus setting the precedent for this practice in Sanskritic Hinduism. Ceremonial iconic ?gamas multiplied with the construction of shrines of wood, brick, and stone as revealed in this sensuous verse on iconic p?j?: 'Goddess shining green in color, adored by devotees, we worship you with oblations, you who multiply by hundreds and grow by thousands' (Mah?n?r?yana Upanisad 1.36). ROOTS OF P?J?: THE TAMIL CASE In South India during the Cankarn centuries, the initial exchanges were reciprocal and fairly equal between local Dravidian culture and immigrant Br?hmana seers (p?rpp?r) who knew the Vedas. Tolk?ppiyam (200 BCE), probably the earliest extant Tamil work, records this mutual borrowing in a myth that the primal god Murukan taught Tamil to sage Agastya who brought Sanskrit to the south (Hart 1975a; Younger 1995; Zvelebil 1973). By the first century CE, gods, myths, and language were diffused through osmosis and syncretism. This validates Kamil Zvelebil's (1991) caution against a 'rigid dichotomic view' equating culture solely with language. Ironically, the seeds of Tamil piety lie in the humanistic concerns of Cankarn poets who wrote on the temporal world of kings and war in the puram poems and on the emotive world of life, love, and death in the akam poems. However, the poets clearly integrated the secular and the sacred by linking holy spaces and</page><page sequence="12">176 / Sita Anantha Raman deities with human events. Nature and topography thus form the framework for the Tolk?ppiyam's delineation of five regions/seasons/times (tinais), each with a divine guardian (Hart 1975a; Meister 1983; Ramanujan 1967, ?985; Zvelebil 1973).10 Two deities were immanent Dravidian gods of the hunters, Murukan/ Cevv?j, the red hill-god who carried a spear (v?l), and his mother Korravai/CQli, who also held a trident (Kuruntokai 218.1 ). In the early interface, cultural immersion and intermarriage among Dravidian speaking groups, aboriginals, and Br?hmanas resulted in the merger of local and Sanskritic divinities. Thus, Tamil Murukan was identified with northern Skanda; Korravai with northern Durg?; and Korravan, a one-dimensional Tamil god of death, with Siva, who represents both life as Ungarn and the cosmic dancer Natar?ja, and with death as Cufalai M?tan, lord of fiery dissolution on the funeral ground. Siva's complexities may easily be due to his development that involved the interface between a pre-?ryan divinity and Vedic Rudra (Kramrisch 1981; Yocum 1982).11 Across India, local goddesses, believed by the folk to inhabit rivers, mountains, and trees (Eck 1996; Humes 1996; Sax 1991), were identified with the great Sanskritic Devi in another interface (Coburn 1996).12 Cankarn poems are replete with references to beings residing in the environ ment. These include fearful and benign gods (katavul, tey); magical forces behind fertility, bloodshed, and death (anahku); ghostly spirits (p?y) and demons (c?r) in trees and hills (Akan?n?ru 22, 58, 138; Kuruntokai 87.1, 89, 100; Puran?n?ru 198.9, 199.1); and obligatory rites of appeasement (katan). The poets refer to early p?j?s in arboreal shrines of wood, brick, or stone platforms (patis) that encircled the tree base and pilgrimages to hill shrines. These p?j?s consisted of smearing and decorating (taivaral/p?cai) tree platforms with blood, dung, clay, grain, flowers, grass, and leaves. There are frequent references to offerings of flowers (pu) and the sacrifice of goats and sheep whose meat was offered to divinities (Akan?n?ru 149.12, 195; Cilappatik?ram 1.5, 167-68, 172). Sometimes they invoked a cure by painting images on a back wall (Akan?n?ru 167), by placing votive icons (patimam) on patis, or by drawing magical, rice flour k?lams around trees (Aihkurun?ru 245, 247). One poet describes the worship of Murukan by smearing the sacred altar with grain and blood: Thereupon the site (for the dance) was prepared; the garlanded lance was installed there; songs were sung echoing across the richly decorated shrine; sacrificial offerings were made; well-shaped red grains mixed with blood [of slaughtered animals] were scattered. Thus, on that day by awesome midnight, Murukan was invoked [with the V?lan's dance] (Akan?n?ru 22; Ponniah 1997:217).</page><page sequence="13">Lay rituals in South Indian temples I 177 A preoccupation with life and death lies at the core of Dravidian-aboriginal substantive p?j?s. The early Tamils undertook obligatory vows to appease anahku who were believed to bring about life and death through pain, blood, and sexuality (Bayly 1989; Hart 1975a). Cankarn anthologies refer to the sacred anahku of kings whose scarred bodies were like medicinal tree bark (Puran?n?ru 180), to war rituals by priests and priestesses (372), and to funeral rites for fallen heroes and chaste heroines in memorial-pillar stones or natukal (42, 231, 232, 264-65, 278; Akan?n?ru 35). In his exegesis, Hart (1975a) defines anahku as a 'dangerous immanent deity' who caused the bloody chaos of war and perceptively argues that p?j? substances served as 'insulators' against anahku's magic. Moreover, he argues that early Tamil gods were immanent and violent and that notions of benign transcendence were borrowed from Sanskritic culture. David Shulman (1980) also considers that violent chaos preceded order and life in the archaic Tamil imagination. Despite Hart's fine analysis of the insulating mechanisms of substantive p?j?, I suggest, briefly here and later at more length, that autochthonous deities had both gentle and fierce miens, and they guarded tinais whose elemental phenomena could be productive or destructive. Thus, Korravai devoured enemies but also gave birth to Murukan. V. S. Rajam (1984) gives a finer definition of anahku as a mysterious, 'god-like strength' connected to nature and sexuality and as one whose impact required a 'chilled' human ritual response. Questions arise as to whether these archaic Tamil rites, directly or indirectly, inspired or evolved into specific Hindu ?gama p?j?s. Ilakkuvanar (1998) attributes a Dravidian etymology for p?j? in the Tamil word p?cai, which means 'to smear/make over/decorate with flowers.' Although his theory may be correct, this conjecture may be difficult to substantiate. It is intriguing that the ancient Tamils smeared and decorated trees and memorial stones with flowers, leaves, and substances. Both Tamil and Sanskritic descriptions of p?j?s entail offerings and ablutions, and although some substances are markedly different, for example, dung and blood versus peacock feathers, the acts themselves are similar. The early Tamils bathed before rituals, and they smeared/decorated/ made over their altars and trees; they also offered flowers and foods of various kinds, it is probable that in the post-Cankam centuries, Br?hmana theologians adapted and refined the original p?cai ablutions with blood, dung, grain, grasses, flowers, and food offerings into elaborate ?gama rituals of snapana/abhiseka. In these Sanskritic rituals, area are bathed with 'pure' (s?ttvika) foods, like oil, turmeric, milk, curds, honey, sandalwood, kuhkumam, and vibh?ti; and arcana offerings are made of fruits, flowers, and foods. In the climate of medieval bhakti, the n?yan?r Campantar describes an early abhiseka in a T?varam verse about the bathing of the Ungarn with 'butter, milk,</page><page sequence="14">178 / Sita Anantha Raman and curds' (Younger 1995). While ?gamas became primary Hindu practices, upper-caste theologians implicitly accepted the primacy of the Vedas, perhaps to downplay the non-?ryan inspiration behind iconic religion. This is seen in South India where the few Br?hmanas largely merged into the local population by marriage and sexual contact, thus facilitating bilateral cultural adoption. Yet Br?hmanas maintained their centrality to the state and to its religion by highlighting their ethnic and caste differences based on an ostensible Vedic heritage (Bhatt 1984; Hazra 1975; Venkatachari 1984). Thus, while the yogi Tirum?lar, like other proponents of Tamil Saiva Siddh?nta ?gama, conjoined Tamil, Upanisadic, and ?gama traditions by praising sublime knowledge (jn?na) as the supreme arcana, he also reaffirmed the transcendence of Vedic Br?hmana as manifest in the unity of Siva-Sakti. ?gama ritualism now became paramount in Hinduism, and it became standard to anoint the temple deities and to offer substances to them. Of the two specific ?gama rituals pertinent to this essay, arcana is a less complex, personalized rite to the deified icon. In arcana, the priest includes the devotee's name when offering flowers, fruits, kuhkumam, camphor, and other elements in a rite, which resembles the offerings of Cankarn devotees. Snapana is a more complex ritual, and it has two aspects. The first type of snapana is immersion in water, and it is one of sixteen steps through which gross construction materials are purified to serve as divine repositories in shrines and icons. In this process, clay, stone, and metal images are magically imbued with life and transformed into deified areas. Certainly, water's purificatory properties are self-evident and were known to Vedic sacrifices and other non Indian religions. However, it does not preclude the knowledge of water as a purifying agent among the Cankarn Tamils who believed that bathing removed ritual pollutions caused by anahku (Hart 1975a). Tamils bathed before battle (Puran?n?ru 79), before marriage (Akan?n?ru 136), and after funerals (Puran?n?ru 329). The snapana ?gama could have been inspired by earlier Dravidian rites where substantive 'insulators' prevented impurities that were caused by malignant, magical agents. Snapana is also a festival rite, one undertaken specifically on a devotee's personal request. On such days the priests solemnly bathe the main icons, sometimes with the divine 'family' retinue (pariv?ra) of consorts and children, demi-gods like A?can?yar, and sublime bhakti saints (Varadachari 1988).13 They anoint the area in oil, honey, milk, and/or vibh?ti with chants from the ?gamas and revere Vedic hymns like the Purusas?kta (Rg Veda 10.90). These ablutions are believed to 'insulate' the area's physical body from malignant forces. The ritual may also have been adopted from early non-?ryan p?j?s, despite its Sanskrit liturgy, philosophical allusions, and metaphors.</page><page sequence="15">Lay rituals in South Indian temples I 179 While the substances used in Cankarn rituals and the impetus to perform these may be different from snapana and arcana as well as modem lay p?j?s, there is also a fundamental point of resemblance. All three sets of rituals are substantive ablutions and offerings of flowers and foods to manifest divinities at sacred sites. Interestingly, modern folk rites to trees and natukal Ungarns in South India occur in the rural, wooded, hilly continuum around Tenkasi and Courtallam, whose farming populations are now merging rapidly with aboriginals from the hills. These folk rites involve the offering of flowers and foods, the smearing of natukal Ungarns and trees with kuhkumam, and the tracing of k?lams. These do resemble the early Tamil Cankarn rites in forests and farming areas, and this may indicate that they preceded Hindu snapana and arcana to icons in large urban temples dominated by Br?hmana priests. Like p?j?, emotive bhakti devotion to immanent beings also may have stemmed from prehistoric religious notions in India. The Sanskrit term first appears in compositions from a period of intense cultural transformation around 300 BCE. The resilience of these texts may be partially due to their articulation of folk adoration for immanent gods. A late Upanisad describes Siva as the 'adorable' Being who is 'rooted (sth?nu) in his glory like a tree' (Svet?svatara Upanisad 6.7, 6.23), while the Bhagavad G?ta (10.20-21, 11.44, 12.1-20) elaborates on theistic bhakti p?j? as a plebian but sublime path open to all. In South India, akam verses on the longing of separated lovers probably inspired the expressions of an early bhakti text like Parip?tal (fourth century CE), whose poets juxtapose adoration for similarly beguiling gods, Tamil Murukan/Cevv?! (1-4) and northern Krsna/M?y?n (5-6). These spiritual yearnings reached their apex with the medieval Tamil saints. In another example of the influence of pre-?ryan religion on bhakti Hinduism, early Tamil poets described frenzied dancing (veri) (Akan?n?ru 22), possession by anahku (Kuruntokai 366; Puran?n?ru 22, 259), wild dancing at a festival (Kuruntokai 366), and the uninhibited dance of the forest-goddess C?lini/C?li ('V?ttuvavari') (Cilappatik?ram 12). Shamanism may lie at the core of the uninhibited, surreal ecstasies of medieval Tamil bhakti mystics, many of whom were lower caste and non-?ryan (Hart 1975a; Ramanujan 1981; Yocum 1982; Zvelebil 1991). Their unabashed longing for spiritual union defined humanistic bfiakti; even ritually excluded saints like Kannappa, the aboriginal hunter, and another saint, Nantan?r, an 'untouchable' skinner of carcasses whose spiritual yearning was apparently satisfied in a beatific vision (Vanmikanathan 1985).'4 Yet there was little overt recognition of the seminal folk contribution to Hinduism. Tamil vell?la (non-Br?hmana landowning elite) kings augmented their territorial power and constructed stone temples for Sanskritized, non-?ryan</page><page sequence="16">180 / Sita Anantha Raman gods (Appadurai 1979; Champakalakshmi 1996; Kulke 1991; Shulman 1980). In an effort to legitimize power, they pragmatically included peripheral denizens into the state, gave Sanskrit names to local deities, and occasionally housed pre ?ryan gods in subsidiary shrines in the main temples. Br?hmanas now conse crated these icons and shrines with Hindu ?gamas (Harshananda 1991; Michell 1997; Varadachari 1988). However, the status of the lower strata was determined by a semifeudal economy (Nilakanta Sastri 1963; Subrahmanian 1998), while ?gama ritualism effectively defused the potential for a radical revolution spurred by plebian, low-caste bhakti saints (Shulman 1980).15 TREE PILLARS, MEMORIAL PILLARS, TEMPLE PILLARS As stated above, the ancient Tamils primarily saw sacrality in the manifestations of nature, and their immanent divinities pervaded its elemental spaces. Despite the rationalist counterpoint that the Tamils did not personify nature as God/gods but believed in 'material nature' (Varadarajan 1988), the poets clearly imbued physical spaces with sacred spirits; both benign gods and ghostly demons haunted trees (Patirruppattu 11 ; Puran?n?ru 23). Thus, the poets describe 'dewy/icy' mountain abodes of the gods (Kuruntokai 218; Puran?n?ru 198.3), hill shrines for Murukan (Akan?n?ru 22, 58, 138; Kuruntokai 89, 100), and forests where yogis prayed to three-eyed Siva (Puran?n?ru 6.17-20). Peering from the banyan's arboreal recesses were the dark-eyed god Visnu in a banyan tree (?lamara katavul) (Puran?n?ru 198.9), a fearful god (katavul) who hid in a p?pala tree (Kuruntokai 87.1), and fierce Culi who carried a spear and resided in the mountains (Kuruntokai 218.1; Hart 1975a). The Cankarn anthologies refer often to sacred, life-giving, tutelary trees (katinwram, k?valmaram) that empowered warrior-kings (Puran?n?ru 23.8-9) and to the eternal tree of abundance (1.9.8). The first shrines were hypaethral, flat-roofed circular platforms of wood, clay, or brick around banyan, p?pala, jackfruit, n?ma, and margosa trees, while occasionally a post/pillar (kantulkoti) represented the deity (kantutai potiyal) (Meister 1983; Sivaram 1994; Srinivasan 1973). They placed engraved votive images on tree platforms (Aihkurun?ru 245, 247; Akan?n?ru 149.12) when praying for a cure or victory. Cilapatik?ram (canto 12) contains a paean to 'dark blue' C?li/C?lini who was transformed into Visnu's sister and Siva's wife, and her shrine was beautified by katampa, punnai, and kuravu flowers near mango, sal, and sandalwood trees. Clearly, Cankarn Tamils believed that sacrality lay prima facie in nature's diversity before its mysterious, magical appearance as a single, transcendent</page><page sequence="17">Lay rituals in South Indian temples I 181 essence. They made offerings to Siva and Visnu who 'pervaded' the trees, but they also feared demons who swept down at night and disrupted their p?j?s. The spread of bhakti probably quelled some of the early fears of demonaic spirits, giving way to more secure visions of nature. Thus, Parip?tal (4.65) describes mysterious/magical M?y?n who is Krsna, an immanent god whose names derive from his abodes in trees, in rivers, and in steep mountains. Dravidian notions of sacred sites and pilgrimages were incorporated into Hinduism through early bhakti hymns like Tirumurulc?rruppatai (117-18), which asks devotees to visit Murukan's shrines fearlessly as 'In holy hill the god in joyful peace abides' (Pattup?ttu p.345). If the power of life was acknowledged in the tree pillar, the motif of death's power was symbolized by the natukal/kal, stone marker, many of which are strewn across the Tamil plains. The first shrines were probably life-giving tree pillars, followed by stone memorials; subsequently, devotees saw the temple pillar as a lay ritual site. While the tree and stone pillars are also found in conjunction with each other, the aura of death so permeated stone (kal) that originally this medium was not used for early shrines. The early Tamils erected natukal near cremation grounds (eutalai) for fallen heroes, chaste women, and death as Korravan, who resembled Vedic Yama (Puran?n?ru 42).16 That Tamils did venerate the natukal as a shrine to the departed person is seen in a Cankarn poem (Puran?n?ru 264-65) that describes the garlanding of a natukal with copper-red flowers and peacock feathers (mayirp?li). Although peacock feathers are not used in modern Hindu lay and ?gama p?j?s, flowers continue to be an integral part of the veneration of sacred images and shrines in Hindu temples. Similarly, while modern lay worshipers of natukal near Tenkasi and Courtrallam do not string peacock feathers, they do drink toddy and offer sacrifices and flowers. One Cankarn verse (Akan?n?ru 35) describes a dead Maravar warrior whose spirit was the god concealed in the natukal (patukkai katavul), which women decorated thus: 'The brave Maravar warrior who lived and was felled by a bow is now a god hidden in the stone memorial that women decorate with peacock feathers, drinking toddy and offering sacrifice' (my translation). Eventually in South India, Korravan's rather flat, morbid identity merged with the more complex personality of ?iva, who represented an earlier interface between folk and Vedic traditions in North India. Siva's association with the funeral ground, as the lord of destruction, is seen in South India where he is called Cutalai M?tan, the term also used for the natukal itself. Yet, as ?iva's procreative force is symbolized by the Ungarn (Kramrisch 1981; Yocum 1982; Younger 1995), in South India the Ungarn and natukal are often interchangeable and venerated in the same way. Natukal-cutalai m?tans are safeguarded even today from urban developers.17 Devotees do substantive p?j?s to stone</page><page sequence="18">182 / Sita Anantha Raman memorials, trees, and temple pillars, all of which have similar components connected to ablution and offering. I observed devotees washing icons and placing flowers and foods near the base of trees on festival days in Tenkasi and Tiruvanmiyur, smearing kuhkumam on trees at Tenkasi, and draping red or green skirts and stringing beads around natukals near Tenkasi and Ambasamudram. Scholars have offered different theories on the religious practices of pre ?ryans in India and the role of icons and shrines in worship. Hart (1975a) theorizes on the dark origins of Tamil gods like anahku and katavul, while Shulman (1980) and Kramrisch (1981) suggest that early Indian cultures often believed that violence and chaos preceded order and human enjoyment of the world. Moreover, by shaping the unmanageable tree into a shrine, humans could mediate between the malevolent and benevolent forces of nature. These lead such scholars to further questions regarding early Tamil notions of life and death, obligatory vows and celebratory p?j? rites, and connections between the immanent sap of a life-giving tree, the charred funeral log (cutalai), and the transcendent rite of mortal passing (katam). Affirming the last element would confirm Hart's theory that notions of transcendence were imported from the Vedas to pre-?ryan cultures. While these are interesting speculations, rituals empower individuals by linking their activities to natural forces; rituals are probably as much about obligation as they are celebrations of existence. The first shrines were probably tree pillars, as the human cognition of existence precedes that of death. Moreover, as natural phenomena are both benign and malevolent, in the earliest eras, a fine line probably divided human fear of unknown forces from awe that those same forces could vitalize the environment. Early gods thus may have appeared auspicious in one aspect and barely distinguishable from demons in another. Tamil gods were both productive and destructive, and their enigmatic powers were associated with blood, life, and death. While the poets express trepidation at fierce anahku who are hidden in the recesses of dark foliage, their poems also record a sensual pleasure in various types of trees that have been associated with fertility and the sap of life in pan-Indian folk religion (Amrithalingam 1998; Malla 2000). Rajam (1984, 1992) is probably more accurate in her definition of anahku as a 'god-like strength' that permeated sexuality and nature as in trees.19 This resolves the duality of anahku's power which was associated strangely with pain and healing, menstrual potency, and ritual pollution. Moreover, the early p?j?s and pilgrimages were not just obligatory rites of appeasement but were bacchanalian celebrations in which devotees bathed and adorned themselves, drank, ate, and danced to tunes played on lutes and the tuti drum.

The tree pillar as sacred space has obviously captured the folk imagination from the earliest centuries of Tamil history.20 This is seen in the common veneration of trees for fertility, in the ritual space allotted to sthala vrksa in the v?stu m?ndala, and in the anointing of votive images placed on the tree platforms. This is also seen in legends such as the four hundred-year-old myth of the folk temple to M?lmutt?r Amman in Tenkasi, in which the goddess is believed to have appeared by a jackfruit tree to a K?oar florist, Ma?janaiyikka Akhil?ntamman, and instructed her to build a shrine around the icon. A similar myth in Kazhugu Malai states that blood flowed from a pillar tree (koti maram), and the florist Pantara caste devotees erected a tree shrine to Pey?cci Amman and Aiyan?r, their tutelary versions of Sakti and Siva, respectively. CONCLUSION: THEJANA'S SEARCH FOR EMPOWERMENT There has been an ongoing interface between folk and elite religious practices and ideas in India, where multilayered traditions indicate the intermeshing of various ethnic, linguistic, and genetic groups over the millennia. This paper places the evidence of specific modern lay rites at public temple sites in a theoretical framework in order to study the historical processes of cultural transmission between the folk and the elite in South India. It concludes that folk religious notions, myths, and practices have been adopted by elite theologians over the millennia but that these contributions have been largely unacknow ledged due to their plebian origins. The paper specifically examines the modern personal p?j?s of ablution and offering at temple pillars and niches and their resemblance to classical Sanskrit ?gama p?j?s of snapana/abhiseka and arcana, which priests conduct to the main icons in the sanctum. It also compares these lay rites and elite ?gama p?j?s to those delineated in archaic Caiikam Tamil texts. It proposes that snapana/ abhiseka and arcana rites probably evolved from Cankam-era Dravidian aboriginal rites of substantive ablution and offering to divinities believed to inhabit trees and memorial stones. In snapana, priests bathe/anoint the icon in the sanctum, and in arcana, they offer foods and fruits to the icon. While pre Sanskritic rites may have involved certain other substances than those used either in ?gama p?j?s or in modern lay p?j?s, other substances remain the same. Moreover, all three sets of rites involve anointing/smearing with natural products</page><page sequence="22">Figure 5.

As the earliest Vedic texts do not mention the offering of flowers or ablutions of shrines/sacred sites, one can conclude that these rites were borrowed from Dravidian-aboriginal cultures. Moreover, worshipers in the Cankarn era probably believed that such substances insulated the rite/performer from dangerous elements, anahku. Br?hmana theologians probably adopted these substantive acts from non-Vedic cultures for two ?gama p?j?s. In arcana, the icon is offered flowers and substances, while in snapana, the icon is bathed with s?ttvika or 'pure' substances, like milk, honey, gh?, or turmeric, which protect the icon from malignant forces. However, while the initial interface between Dravidian-aboriginal and Sanskritic religion in South India may have been bilateral, in later eras the folk were marginalized when their rites and myths were subsumed into Sanskritic Hinduism with little recognition. ?gama rituals were elevated to the highest form of Hinduism, and folk rituals have become peripheral. Moreover, this paper speculates on the probable social and theological repercussions of such apparently spontaneous, personal rituals by the Tamil jana today. A study of the modern phenomenon compelled me to examine the historical exclusion of the folk from temples with Br?hmana priests and from other sacred arenas in earlier eras. Ironically, these medieval meanderings offered an insight into why the jana's personal rites are so noticeable today in public places. Early Tamil Cankarn notions of pollution were connected to a belief in anahku, fearful/awe-inspiring beings associated with sexuality, menstrual bleeding, pain, illnesses, and death. In order to ward off pollution, devotees generally bathed and adorned themselves before undertaking rites at Murukan's sacred sites and bathed after visiting a funeral site like a natukal. Such notions became embedded in the South Indian caste system with the spread of ?gama ritualism through which Br?hmanas kept the temple free of pollution, especially in the garbhagrha. Cekkil?r records the exclusion of lower-caste worshipers like Kannappa and Nantan?r, whose occupations involved bleeding and carcasses. In the colonial era, religious discrimination probably intensified when the sacred literate castes prospered by becoming mediators for the British (Guha 1982; Metcalf 1994; Rajakrishnan 1993). The poor and low castes were often shunted aside in temples to make way for wealthier, elite caste worshipers, and the jana directed their worship to accessible pillars at the entrance.21 Although modern grass-roots campaigns have opened temples to all castes today and instances of overt discrimination are fewer, they still continue. Thus, priests in Tiruchendur did preferential arcanas for our group of high-caste and influential worshipers. In Kanyakumari, the queue of devotees was considerably incensed when the priest offered to let us bypass the crowd for a fee. However, folk agency has continued despite attempts to submerge and control</page><page sequence="24">188 / Sita Anantha Raman the more marginalized strata of South India. This is seen in the inclusion of the tree pillar in temples and in the lingering of folk rituals near trees and on memorial pillars in arboreal and rural settings even today. Folk devotees also connect the primal tree-pillar and memorial-pillar shrines with the urban temple pillar, and the jana clearly perform personal p?j?s at these public spaces in Tamilnadu. While there are no statistics to prove that this is a burgeoning phenomenon in the postmodern era in this region, the Dravidian rationalist agenda since 1914 as well as non-Br?hmana political rule for several decades have resulted in anti Br?hmana rhetoric and programs. The conviction has grown that equality is a birthright and that occupations should not be based solely on birth, an argument that has fueled the Sana's democratic, public expressions of self-empowerment. Thus, when devotees today perform personal rituals in the temple's public spaces, they effectively challenge Br?hmana control over sacrosanct practices and hereditary hierarchies. In this climate of Br?hmana control over rituals, lay contestations perhaps stem more from social rather than religious causes. This paper also demonstrates that there may be a division between the ranks of the most orthodox priests, who control the sanctum's mystique through ?gama p?j?s, and the minor priests from the jana, who empathize with devotees and consider lay rites to be auspicious outpourings of folk bhakti. Lay rituals also challenge the doctrine of karma with its view of postmortem social justice, since few Tamils today would attribute low caste or status solely to their past karmic deeds (Waghorne 2001 ).22 For many devotees in South India, the doctrine probably provides greater psychological comfort rather than a problematic eschatological hope. The Tamil jana's search for temporal empowerment is evident not only at temple-pillar sites but also in the mushrooming of small shrines on crowded street corners and in huge public displays of temple lights and hoardings, which encroach on municipal space. In this modern interface between the folk and the elite, the Tamil jana seems to be awakening to the fact that the folk can be the agents of religious and social change today. Notes 1.

An example lies in the prayer offerings at Nagur (Nagapattinam) darg?h to the sixteenth-century graves of the S?fi p?r Miran S?hib and his wife Sultana B?b?. In a rite similar to Hindu arcana, Muslim mullahs offer personalized Tamil and Arabic prayers to devotees regardless of sectarian affiliation. Devotees offer flowers, fruits, coconuts, a form of ash, or meat. The darg?h information booklet uses the term 'bhakti' to describe the devotion of Muslim and Hindu pilgrims. 4. Goldsmiths, carpenters, masons, and blacksmiths in Madurai and Rama nathapuram authored Tamil and Sanskrit inscriptions from 200 BCE-300 CE. Pallava, P?ntiya, and Cola plates from the seventh to the fourth centuries offer evidence of their literary and engineering skills. 5. The seventeenth-century South Indian Siva temple at Suchindram contains an open area shrine in which there looms a gigantic visvarfipa of A?can?yar. Priests perform rituals, but this god clearly could not be accommodated by the ?gama norms for a small, secret garbhagrha', so he hovers outside the Sanskritic world yet is brought into its broad umbrella by the Br?hmana's skill. The modern A?can?yar temple at Nanganallur near Chennai has a colossal garbhagrha icon that is visible from the street. 6. The persistent folk veneration for this simian hero challenges the validity of recent Dalit charges against the epic and Hanum?n. Dalits contend that colonial social Darwinism influenced elite caste nationalists who misread the R?m?yana as a racial metaphor to explain Aryan dominance over non-?ryans, and in this falsified history, the elite caricaturized aboriginals as subhuman monkeys. Zelliot remarks that B. R. Ambedkar described lower-caste S?dras as former Ksatriyas in his 1946 polemical work, Who were the Shudras. I suggest that while colonial-era historians often confused cultural with racial hegemony, the Hanum?n myths were not an elite invention to subjugate the lower castes. If this were true, the lower castes would not worship Hanum?n, whose tradition is vibrant in forests and village shrines and in stone temples with Br?hmana priests who cater today to a cross-section of castes. Even Ramasami, the Dravidian atheist who deconstructed the R?m?yana by praising R?vana as a hero, did not</page><page sequence="26">190 / Sita Anantha Raman equate Hanum?n with the lower castes but merely dismissed him as a mischievous monkey. 7. The earliest material expressions of iconic worship of manifest gods are found in Neolithic sites in the Baluchi Hill and Harappa (ca. 3000 BCE). These are small, cylindrical, phallic artifacts like the Ungarn that was later associated with Hindu Siva; circular holed stones, possibly symbolic of the vagina-uterus (yoni) of the goddess; seals featuring a yog?-\\ke figure with an erect phallus like later images of Siva; and small household goddess figurines. Evidence of Hindu iconic worship in shrines can be found after the first century BCE in the Ghosundi pillar in Rajasthan, whose inscription describes a Visnu shrine and rites for Siva; in the Besnagar pillar in Madhya Pradesh (second century CE) erected by the Bh?gavata tradition; and in the South Indian Gudimallam copper Ungarn (first century CE). The popularity of Siva as the 'rooted one' or Ungarn is apparent in natukal megaliths in South India and in the Siva, Lihga, and V?mana Pur?nas (third-fifth centuries CE). These texts revere Siva as the 'celestial lihga' of light and as the 'root pillar' (m?la stambha) with his cosmic substance (prakrti) in the Lihga Pur?na. 8. ?pastamba Srautas?tra (1.19.9) states that Ksatriays, Vaisyas, and S?dras lit the sacrificial fire; K?ty?yana Srautas?tra (12.11.11) mentions the initiation of the wheelwright and hunter. 9. Hart uses the term 'immanent' to distinguish between Dravidian and Sanskritic notions of divinity. He argues that the earliest Tamil gods were 'fearful,' violent, or associated with death and that benign, transcendent gods were imported from Vedic culture. Although death loomed large in the Cankarn landscape, I suggest that archaic Tamil deities were linked to both the productive and destructive aspects of nature and that they were both fierce and benign, so that goddess Korravai gave birth to Murukan but also devoured enemies. 10. The tinai were kurinci or mountainous (cold/night), guarded by Tamil Murukan; p?lai or desert (summer/noon), the domain of the Tamil goddess Korravai (Cilappatik?ram 1.5, 2.11) and of Aditya, the Vedic sun-god; mullai or forest/pastures (rains/evening), roamed by 'magical' M?y?n/Tirum?l, the Tamil guise of northern Krsna; neytal or coast/sunrise, overseen by northern Varuna; and marutam or riverine/agricultural (rains/dawn), guarded by northern V?liy?n/ Balar?ma. 11. Material evidence of the fusion between north and south is evident in the Gudimallam copper Ungarn, which is reminiscent of the clay phallic images in the hills of Baluchi. Kramrisch makes a fine argument regarding the link between Siva's 'celestial lihg?' as a fire of light, his stone 'root pillar' (m?la stambha) containing his cosmic substance (prakrti) as described in Lihga Pur?na, and Dravidian-aboriginal megaliths. This explains how the Tamil</page><page sequence="27">Lay rituals in South Indian temples I 191 worship of natukals for heroes near cremation grounds (cutalai) merged with the worship of Korravan and with Hindu Siva. The worship of Siva as creator and destroyer spread in South India through proselytizing n?yan?rs. 12. Eck (1996), describing the river goddess Gang? M?t?, and Humes (1996), describing pilgrimages to the mountain goddess Vindhyavasin?, connect sacred sites and goddesses in the folk imagination. 13. Varadachari (1988: 344-46) quotes the Vaikh?nasa S?tr?gama and Sr?prasna Samhit? identifying sixteen purifications for an icon: making the image pavilion (mandapa), 'opening the eyes' by immersing the icon into water (jal?dhiv?s?), anointing (snapana), reclining in grains and cloth (s?yan?dhi v?sa), fire purification (agni samsk?ra), pacification (s?nti liorna), feeding Br?hmanas (br?hmana bhoja), awakening (sparsana) by breathing life into the image (pr?napratisth?), purification of the shrine space (gehasuddhi), fashion ing the 'female' pedestal cavity by placing 'male' gem-seeds (ratnany?sa), completion (p?rn?hiti), installation (sth?pana), empowering the area (proksana), chanting hymns (mantrany?sa), settling in the family of gods (pariv?ra), and giving honoraria to priests (daksina). 14. Cekkij?r's narratives list the fisherman Atipattar (19-21), the potter N?lakantar (378-84), the toddy-tapper Ematinarar (406-12), the blacksmith Eripatin?tar (412-17), and the cowherd ?yan?r (568-72). There were also the female yogi K?raikk?l Ammaiy?r and other women devotees (Vanmikanathan 1985). 15. One of the finest examples of this phenomenon was in the remaking of the Citra festival for Madurai M?n?ksi Amman by Tirumala N?yaka in the seventeenth century. An excellent historical depiction is in the film, Wedding of the goddess, produced by the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1982. 16. This picture of Korravan resembles that of Yama, the yellow-eyed black god with two guard dogs and a club in the Rg Veda. Yama is the first man (Rg Veda 10.10.7-14), but the son of Vivasan, the 'brilliant light,' and Saranyu, the 'storm cloud' (10.17.1). 17. At Tenkasi's Cirrarruv?ri Ammarj-Katayanall?r C?taiar K?vil, the non Br?hmana priest revealed the secret natukal behind Siva's anthropomorphic icon to me. I was also told that city officials avoided paving over a natukal by diverting the road. It now lies undisturbed and hidden in an embankment gutter. 18. For non-Sanskritic folk beliefs on creation and their sexual and gender implications, see Sax's (1991) discussion of a Garhwali tribal myth that life emerged from ?disakti's bloody womb. 19. In another exegesis, Rajam (1992) challenges Western interpretation of karpu 'as chastity,' often that of females. She argues that the etymological root is kal or 'to learn from experience' and that Western scholars have relied on</page><page sequence="28">192 / Sita Anantha Raman male-biased medieval Tamil texts, which interpret the word in terms of female sexual experience, as opposed to male scholars understanding. 20. The sthala vrksa at Gangaikondancholapuram and Tiruvanmiyur was the vanni, the eampakam at Tenkasi's Kas? Visvan?tha K?vil, the vilvam at Thanjavur Brihad?svarar, the jackfruit at Kuttralam, the mango at Kanci, the malai k?tt?ttimaram at Srivilliputtur and Aryanayakipuram, and the n?ma at Krishnapuram. 21. This conclusion is based on interviews with those who remember such instances in their youth in the mid-twentieth century: Natraj Raman (Chennai, 12 August 1997) and K. Suryanarayanan (Chennai, 12 August 1997); and personal visits to Tiruchendur, July 1997, and to Kanyakumari, January 2000. 22. Waghorne makes an interesting study of the gentrification of rituals amongst the Tamils at the Amman temple in Myalpore, Chennai. References Cited Ai?kurun?ru. 1972. Aihkurun?ru (ed. and trans. P. V.
