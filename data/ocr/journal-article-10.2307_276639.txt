<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURE CHANGE IN THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS, WASHINGTON RoY L. CARLSON ABSTRACT The archaeological sequence in the San Juan Islands is known best from two phases: the Marpole phase which occurs within the first millennium B.C., and the San Juan phase which lasts from at least A.D. 1300 to historic times. More difficult to place culturally and chronologically are: (1) the previously excavated bluff areas of Cattle Point which contain components similar to Whalen I and II and would thus occupy the time period between about 500 B.C. and A.D. 400; and (2) the Argyle Lagoon site which, though early, cannot be related definitely to other components because of insufficient excavation. Culture change is shown by increasing maritime adaptation through time and by the gradual replacement of the chipped stone industry by one using abrading and polish- ing techniques as the result of influence from the Old World. A RCHAEOLOGICAL excavations at nine sites in the San Juan Islands (Fig. 1) permit (1) the formulation of the San Juan phase which includes components from Jekyll's La- goon, Turn Point, Lime Kiln, Moore, Mack- aye, and Cattle Point, and which is identifiable with the culture of the Salish Indian groups who occupied the islands in historic times, and (2) the grouping of the Garrison site and part of the assemblage from the Richardson site into the Marpole phase. Additional components from Argyle Lagoon and Cattle Point are early, but are difficult to relate to the other phases found in this area. The terms used by King (1950) to designate phases of the Cattle Point site are not used here as they imply a certain developmental sequence that is somewhat controversial. Phases with geographic names remedy this situation. The archaeology of the Fraser delta, the San Juan Islands, and Puget Sound constitutes a rea- sonably unified whole. The firmest local chro- nology that has bearing on our subject is that established by Borden for the sites on and im- mediately adjacent to the Fraser delta just to the north of the San Juan Islands, but which is not yet in print. The components from the Point Grey, Beach Grove, and Marpole sites group into the Marpole phase which has an average radiocarbon date of 662 B.C. based on dates from the Marpole site. The component from the Gar- rison site to be discussed in this paper ties in well with this phase because of the presence of the Marpole-type barbed antler harpoon, the general use of antler as opposed to bone for mak- ing barbed projectile points, the stone adz blades finished on one side only, stone carving, the well developed art style, and the emphasis on chipped stone projectile points. Part of the as- semblage from the Richardson site belongs to this phase also. Another early phase that Borden has isolated is that found at Locarno Beach and as the lower of two components at the Whalen site. Radio- carbon dates are 476 B.C. for the former and 493 B.C. for the latter (Daugherty 1958: 454). The typical implements from this phase are large, faceted, ground slate points; toggling harpoon heads either composite or one piece; faceted ground bone points; an advanced art and prob- ably ceremonialism; and heavy ground slate points. In the San Juans these traits occur only in the bluff areas of Cattle Point, but somewhat different artifactual associations are reported (King 1950), however, which may indicate tem- poral or cultural differences or mixture of ele- ments. The upper component at the Whalen site has a date of A.D. 377 (Daugherty 1958: 454). The artifacts common there are numerous chipped stone points, obsidian microblades, ground adz blades, two-piece toggles and other items (Bor- den 1950). There is the suggestion of relation- ships with part of the Cattle Point sequence, particularly the "Maritime" phase, but more information is needed to define it adequately. The San Juan phase is, for all practical pur- poses, identical with the Late phase on the Fra- ser delta (Borden 1950, 1951) with the Penn Cove phase from the Skagit-Whidbey area (Bryan 1957) and with the component from Old Man House in Puget Sound (Snyder 1956). This is essentially Northwest Coast culture as it is known ethnographically from this area. Archaeologically it is definable by the virtual absence of chipped stone artifacts, and the pres- ence of unbarbed and unilaterally barbed bone projectile points, bone barbs for composite fish hooks, small composite toggle heads, numerous wood working tools at winter village sites, and by a settlement pattern involving permanent winter villages of plank houses coupled with 562</page><page sequence="2">CHRONOLOGY IN THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS FIG. 1.

This phase was apparently in full swing by A.D. 1300 as Borden has a radiocarbon date of 660?130 B.P. for the beginning of the village of Tselax at Musqueam. MARPOLE PHASE SITES The Marpole site located on the Fraser delta to the north of the San Juan Islands was inves- tigated years ago by Harlan I. Smith (1903) and Charles Hill-Tout (1895) and was referred to as either the Eburne mound or the Great Fraser Midden. Recently it has been reinvestigated by Charles Borden (1950, 1951) although few of the recent data are in print. Two sites in the San Juans, Garrison (SJ-25) and Richardson (SJ-185), show ties with the Marpole site. Mar- pole itself shows a highly developed culture, climactic in character, with an elaborate cul- tural inventory. The average of two radiocarbon dates run by the University of Saskatchewan for Borden is 662 B.c. Both dates are from the same sample of charcoal and are respectively 943 and 381 B.C. There are some differences between the Marpole site and these two San Juan sites which are probably due to the marginal posi- tion of the latter in relation to Marpole and to a smaller sampling. Garrison Garrison (SJ-25) is a shell midden located approximately 400 yards to the west of the Eng- lish Camp blockhouse on a small point of land which juts out into Garrison Bay. Garrison Bay is one of two large sheltered bays on the northwest side of San Juan Island which have mud flats containing extensive beds of shellfish. An English garrison occupied the area east of the site in the 1860's during the boundary dis- pute between Britain and the United States. The chief remnants of the English occupation are the blockhouse, which is presently being un- dercut by wave action, and numerous fragments of heavy, dark green, wine bottles which are scattered along the beaches of the bay. A large shell midden (SJ-24), which was partially ex- cavated in 1950 under the direction of A. E. Treganza, covers the area occupied by the Eng- lish camp. Shell deposits are almost continuous between the two sites. The northern part of San Juan Island, probably Garrison Bay, is the legendary home of the ancestral group of the Lummi and Songish and possibly the Saanich (Suttles 1951: 33-6). The Garrison site extends about 400 feet along the shore and marks its greatest depth at the point where test pits indicated a depth of at least 3 feet below the beach level, and that the elevation of the point itself is probably wholly artificial. The deposit extends back from the beach for approximately 100 feet and ex- tends up over what appears to be a wave cut terrace. The point itself is at present beach level, whereas the midden to the east and west is on top of a wave cut bank from 5 to 7 feet above the present beach level. Surface cover of the site consists of different grasses and black- berry vines, madrona trees up to 6 feet in dia- meter, and a number of small conifers under 2 feet in diameter. Evidences of former trees growing in the midden were uncovered during excavation. The eastern portion of the site was tested with three connected trenches and two additional test pits (Fig. 2). The stratification (Fig. 3 b) shows that oc- cupation began on the upper levels. Evidence of a precultural vegetation is limited to a few thin patches of gray modified subsoil above the sterile yellow clay. The first layer (Ia) is made up of modified subsoil, some shell fragments, and a few artifacts. In some areas it is capped by yellow clay borrow dirt from pits excavated through it during the deposition of the second layer (Ib), which is essentially a layer of com- pacted whole shell and black dirt. Prior to the build-up of Layer Ib one large pit and one trench had been excavated into the subsoil. Layer Ib is the first shell layer in these features as well as the first layer of shell above the mate- rial excavated from them. The nature of the CARLSON ] 563</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY FIG. 2. Plan of main excavation and Test Pits 1 and 2 at Garrison. shell in Layer Ib does not indicate intensive use of the site which seemingly would have resulted in greater fragmentation of the shell, but suggests rapid accumulation followed by disuse. Dor- mancy of this portion of the site after the deposi- tion of Layer Ib is indicated by a layer of brown- ish silt which is probably wash from up slope and which merges with some of the upper por- tions of this deposit. A large tree stump overlies portions of this layer and its root system has considerably disturbed the stratification. A thin deposit of charcoal overlying some portions of this layer may be an indication that the site was burned over. Neither Layers Ia or Ib are present in the southern part of the excavation where a layer of gray silt (Ic) containing the remains of former bushes and rotted out trees occurs immediately above the subsoil. Layer II, which overlies Layer I in northern part of the main excavation, consists of a fairly homogene- ous mass of black dirt, silt, fragmented shell, ash, fire-cracked rock, and roots. The fill in the features already referred to is mainly from this layer and the majority of the artifacts come from it. In the southern portion of the site Layer IIIa overlies portions of Layer II, and Layer IIIb overlies IIIa. Layer liIa consists largely of whole shell with some lenses of sea-urchin spines, frag- mented shell, fire-cracked rock, and so forth. Layer IIIb was the last to be deposited and con- sists of fragmented shell, rock, charcoal, and humus. Test Pit 1 shows one layer of highly fragmented shell, humus, rock, which on physi- cal appearance probably relates to Layer II of the main excavation. The site thins out in this area and shell is only several inches thick in the northern portion of the test pit. Test Pit 2 has two layers, the lower of which is composed of a high shell content of whole and fragmented shell and probably relates to Layer I of the main excavation. Fragmented shell, ash, rock, and black dirt make up the level above it which probably corresponds to Layer II of the main excavation. It seems likely that the turf over the whole site should be set aside as a separate layer and cultural stratum as it is the only layer in which any trade goods were found. Two trade pipes and fragments of dark green bottle glass probably date from the English occupa- tion or earlier. My suspicion is that excavation on the point itself, which is below the bank on which the excavated portion of the site rests, might reveal a component identifiable in part to the historic period and to which these trade goods might belong. A very shallow depression might prove to be the remains of a house. A few features were uncovered. Six hearths and two fire pits were found. The hearths are best described as accumulations of fire-cracked rock with accompanying ash. The hearths tend to be oval in shape and vary from 5.5 to 1.0 feet in diameter. Two were inclusive within Layer I, three within Layer II, and one within Layer III. The fire pits are similar to the hearths, but differ in being contained in a shallow pit. They vary from 3.0 to 4.0 feet in width and from 0.7 to 0.8 feet in depth. Both were intruded from Layer II slightly into Layer I. A trench, 2.5 feet wide at the bottom and 4.75 feet wide at the top, had been intruded into the yellow subsoil in the northwestern part of the main excava- tion. It was filled with the whole shell of Layer Ib followed by Layer II. The excavated portion was 32 feet long and it continued into the un- excavated portion of the site. A small charred stump in the bottom of the trench was the only associated charcoal. A large pit had been ex- cavated into the subsoil in the northeastern part of the excavation. It measured roughly 6 feet long and 5 feet deep and sloped to a rounded bottom. The fill of the pit consisted of a single layer of stones at the bottom. A very small [VOL. 25, NO. 4, 1960 564</page><page sequence="4">CHRONOLOGY IN THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS amount of charcoal was associated with these rocks. Above this was a layer of fragmented shell followed by a thin deposit of yellow silt, followed by a thick layer of whole shell. Its whole appearance suggests that it was con- structed during Layer Ia times and possibly en- larged and reused during Ib. A mass of melted shell was uncovered in Test Pit 2 where it capped Layer I. The mass lay in black sand and shell and was surrounded by ash. Chemical analysis indicated that clam shells had been converted to the oxide form by the intense heat of a fir wood fire. One complete burial was uncovered in Test Pit 2. The body had been placed on its right side, slightly on its back, with the head pointed to the south. The face had apparently been originally to the east, but as the body decom- posed it fell over the right humerus facing down. The skeleton was fully flexed. There was no trace of a pit. Probably a shallow pit had been scooped out in the shell, the burial placed within, and a covering of the same shell put on top. The burial was apparently made during the deposition of Layer Ib. It was lying on a thin layer of mussel shell above the sterile soil and covered with shell mixed with black dirt. Above this and grading down into it is the silt and charcoal stratum which caps Layer Ib elsewhere in the site. Several fragments of human bone were found scattered throughout the site. The following artifacts were uncovered. Their stratigraphic distribution and frequency are given in Table 1. Barbed bone projectile points (Fig. 4 F, o) are not common. One fragmentary specimen with a pointed butt and oval cross section was un- covered. The place where the point is broken looks as if it has been partly reworked. Awls are common. The ulna awls are all made from deer ulnae. The tips are dull and slightly rounded. The splinter awls are simply bone splinters sharpened on one end. Bone chisels are all fragmentary specimens except one (Fig. 4 F, i) c 2 3 d Heavy Shell &amp; Shell Sand 5 6 Non- Slight Gravel Clay shell Shell Subsoil FIG. 3.

All are of split and ground mammal long bone. One fragment shows a curved asymmetric bit. A bone needle (Fig. 4 B, b) has an asymmetric eye which ap- pears to have been drilled biconically. The cross section is ovoid and the point is missing. Bone ornaments consist of a bird-bone drink- ing tube or bead, 3.8 inches long, which has been ground smooth on both ends; a fragmentary pendant (Fig. 4 C, b) with a plano-convex cross section and biconical perforation; and the end of a gaming bone incised with a zigzag design. Miscellaneous bone artifacts consist of the dis- tal portion of a deer cannon bone which had been grooved around the circumference and then broken, and which is probably detritis from the manufacture of bone artifacts; and fragments of elongate bone objects. These frag- ments are broader and thicker than their coun- terparts in San Juan phase sites. Some are pointed end fragments. Cross section varies from rectanguloid to ovoid except for one speci- men which has a section like a truncated pyra- mid. They may be awl or point fragments. One-piece antler harpoons are represented by two definite barbed specimens with tang and lateral lines guards (Fig. 4 F, a, b) and one problematical fragment with a line hole (Fig. 5 4 3 2 1 1 3 3 1 11 6 5 1 566 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960 1 1 1</page><page sequence="6">CHRONOLOGY IN THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS 4 F, e). It is simply a guess that the latter speci- men is a harpoon, but the curvature of the left side just below the break is so similar to that of the two harpoons that it may well be one. Ant- ler projectile points which have no method of line attachment, and are consequently not har- poons, are represented by one unfinished uni- laterally barbed specimen (Fig. 4 F, f); a short broad unbarbed point with a flat oval cross sec- tion (Fig. 4 F, g); and a triangular blunted point (Fig. 4 F, p) which may be a point for a blunt bird arrow. Antler wedges are one key to the abundant wood working industry of historic times. One of the fragmentary specimens has a straight symmetric bit, and the other has a curved asym- metric bit. Antler flakers are made of deer ant- ler, and in three instances the base of the antler is intact (Fig. 4 F, m). The tip of the flaker is grooved in one instance and blunt in the others. Three of the specimens are highly fragmentary and their classification as flaking implements is open to question. Antler ornaments consist primarily of pend- ants. In addition, one triangular piece of ant- ler is incised with an anthropomorphic face on one side of the piece only. Two of the perfo- rated pendants are also incised and both appear to be reworked fragments of a larger object. Miscellaneous antler artifacts consist of three fragmentary objects: one large fragment which has been girdled as a preliminary to breaking; and two elongate objects one of which has a cut wedge-shaped base. Both of the latter may be unfinished points. Adz blades consist of one unfinished specimen of nephrite and serpentine, and one unfinished fragmentary specimen of tufaceous argillite which has a round asymmetric bit. Ground stone points made of slate, schist, and obsidian were uncovered. The three slate specimens (Fig. 5 E, f, j, k) are thin (0.12 inch) and leaf-shaped with varied section. One is flat and diamond- shaped, one is hexagonal, and one is flat and oval. Two of the schist points (Fig. 5 E, b, i) are leaf-shaped. One has a hexagonal cross section and the other an oval cross section. The smaller specimen is very dull, possibly unfinished. A crude chipped piece of schist looks like a blank for another point. The obsidian point (Fig. 5 E, e) is relatively thick (0.21 inch) with a hexag- onal cross section. It was first completely ground into shape and later rechipped on the edges. This was verified with a binocular microscope. Cobble hammerstones are probably more common than the meager number found indi- cates. All show battering on one or more faces. One specimen has pecked finger depressions, two on each face. Another has a yellowish stain, possibly ocher. Nipple-top maul (Fig. 5 E, h) consists of the top portion only. These were used historically to drive wedges and stakes. Whetstones consist of small rectanguloid sand- stone slabs. None show intentional shaping. A single specimen has striations suggesting use as an anvil stone. Stone ornaments consist of two incised mudstone concretions. One is ovate with crudely scratched lines on both sides which can be called decoration only in the very broad- est sense of the word. The other has an an- thropomorphic face nicely carved into both sides. The style is comparable to that found on seated human figurines holding bowls which are common along the lower Fraser River (Duff 1956). Chipped stone projectile points are relatively common when compared with their distribution in San Juan phase sites. All are made of dense basalt and are somewhat asymmetrical and crude, particularly when compared with forms from the Plateau. They are neither small like the late forms over much of North America nor large like many of the "early man" points, but occupy an intermediate size range. Many of them are quite thick. Some of the crudity may be the result of the difficulty of working dense basalt. The following types are found: San Juan triangular (Fig. 5 C, a-g) is typically straight- sided and flat-based, though in actuality the sides vary from truly triangular to slightly in- curvate to irregular, and the base from slightly concave to convex to irregular. Stems and barbs are absent. The most typical specimens come from the "Late" phase at Cattle Point (King 1950, Fig. 9, 25-31). San Juan stemmed and barbed (Fig. 5 C, n) points are a fairly consist- ent though minor category. Only one specimen was found at this site although they occur in other assemblages. This type as a whole is fairly short and broad with a widely flaring barb on each side and a short contracting stem. The shape of the blade varies from triangular to con- cave to concavo-convex. Leaf-shaped points without stems do not form a consistent cate- gory and no named type is intended here. Two of the specimens have a corner notch on one side only (Fig. 5 C, 1, m). The others are crudely leaf-shaped with convex bases (Fig. 5 CARLSON] 567</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY FIG. 4. Bone and antler artifacts.

Side blades (Fig. 5 C, p-s) were presumably hafted along the side of a wood or bone shaft. I do not know how else to explain the specimens with a leaf-triangular outline, although as yet no implements to which they could be hafted in this manner have been found. All are bifacially chipped and range from crude to well made forms. Pentagonal points (Fig. 5 C, o) are rare. Twelve point fragments which could not be classified were found. None of them show evidence of having possessed a stem. Miscellaneous chipped stone artifacts consist of knives, scrapers, drills and a problematical graver. The knives (Fig. 5 C, t, u) are bifacially chipped. The five scrapers are simply small flakes of basalt with unifacial chipping to form a scraping edge. All are crude. The single drill (Fig. 5 C, w) has a thick ovate body which tapers to a narrow sharp tip on one end, and thins to an irregular edge on the other. Another specimen (Fig. 5 C, v) may be a drill or reamer. Shell artifacts are very difficult to recognize in a shell midden. However, the following spec- imens were recovered: one end-perforated, ground Olivella bead from either Layer Ib or II; three Dentalia shells from Layer II; one nose ring of ground Hinnites giganteus from the turf; one clam shell grooved across the back possibly in the process of being made into an artifact; two clam shells with cut rectanguloid holes in the center; one perforated fragment of Pectin caurinus from Layer II; and one Mytilus califor- nianus scraper from Layer II. In addition, 18 clam shells with holes broken through the cen- ter were uncovered in the excavation. However, it is questionable whether these can be classified as artifacts, for identical holes can be produced fortuitously by dropping the shells. European goods were found only in the turf. The bowls of two clay trade pipes may date from the English occupation or earlier. In summary, the excavation in this portion of the Garrison site showed the presence of three main occupational strata which do not differ markedly in artifactual content although some mixing must have occurred particularly during construction of features. The main oc- cupation was during the deposition of Stratum II. The emphasis on stone chipping and the barbed harpoons with line guards indicate rela- tionship with the Marpole site. The thin ground stone points which occur primarily in Stratum III are possibly prototypes for similar points at Cattle Point. Richardson Richardson (SJ-185) is the remnant of a large, disturbed, eroded shell midden located on a small bay just to the north of Mackaye Harbor on the southwestern side of Lopez Is- land. The highest portion of the midden is at present exposed right at the beach where a 4 to 5 foot vertical exposure runs for approxi- mately 100 yards along the beach. One trench 5 feet wide and 25 feet long was excavated about 15 feet from the beach. About 500 yards to the south a 5 foot square test pit was ex- cavated into the top of a high bluff overlooking the bay. The stratification of the main trench consisted of a lower, thin (up to 0.5-foot thick) layer of black dirt mixed with broken shell, rock, and cultural detritus; followed by a layer of mainly whole shell encompassing a large fired area which extended approximately half the length of the trench and varied from 0.5 to 2.5 feet in thickness; followed by the plow zone which varied from 1 to 1.5 feet in thickness and contained an admixture of nails, glass fragments, and so forth. A small pit with associated shell and sea-urchin remains partially capped by a layer of white clay and two rocks had been partially obliterated by the plow. A disarticu- lated human femur was encountered lying hori- zontally on the lower layer; 5 feet to the south a human skull surrounded by fractured deer bones, shell, and rock was found partially em- bedded in the yellow clay subsoil. The strati- fication in the test pit showed four layers which it is not possible to correlate with those in the trench.

The following artifacts were found eroding from the edge of the site: one barbed antler harpoon with tang and lateral line guards (Fig. 4 F, b); and three fragmentary bone and antler objects. The test pit yielded: one bone knife or chisel fragment; two antler-wedge frag- ments; one halibut-hook barb; one fragmentary antler haft; one possible bone haft; one bird- bone awl with a needle-like tip; one cobble hammerstone; two fragments of what are prob- ably unbarbed bone points; one elongate antler fragment; and one small soapstone fragment which resembles objects from what Duff (1956 P1. 21) calls the Gulf Island complex. The Aldrich collection which is reported to have come mainly from this site contains several frag- mentary ground slate points, some stone dis- coidals, and a piece of sculptured stone which looks like a rather broad maul with a sculptured bird head for a handle. Additional excavation at the site was not re- commended because of its disturbed nature. The site is difficult to generalize about. I doubt if the artifact assemblage represents a single component. However, several artifacts - the barbed antler harpoon, the sculptured stone maul, and the chipped points - show relation- ships with Marpole and indicate that at least part of the site should be placed in the Marpole phase. OTHER EARLY SITES Two sites which contain early components, but which are difficult to relate clearly to other components, are Argyle Lagoon (SJ-2) and the East Bluff area of Cattle Point. Both contain as- semblages which cannot be reproduced else- where and for this reason they will not be grouped into phases. Argyle Lagoon Argyle Lagoon (SJ-2) extends about 300 yards along the north side of Argyle Lagoon on the southeastern side of San Juan Island. The lagoon is surrounded on two sides by a spit in the form of a V and on the third side (north) by a hill formed by a terminal moraine. The spit is formed from material eroded from the mo- raine (Wilson 1926: 137-9). The lagoon covers about 10 acres at high tide and about six at low tide. A narrow channel about 10 yards across connects the lagoon with the waters of the sound. The northern shore slopes up gently from the beach for several hundred feet, and then slopes upward rather sharply. The bank separating the gravel beach from the shore ranges from 4 to 7 feet in height. An under- ground spring is located near the center of the site in the area of modern occupation, and at least one other spring is found on the hill be- hind the site. There is no historic or ethno- graphic information concerning use of the site, although Harlan I. Smith (1907: 383) men- tions what is apparently this site. Excavation was carried on in the eastern and western ex- tremities of the site as the central portion is occupied by the houses of the owners. Portions of the site have been under cultivation for the past 60 years. Seven test pits running in a west to east direction were sunk into the midden. Test Pits 1-4 were 50 feet apart, approximately 50 feet from the bank at the edge of the beach, and 3 feet square; Test Pit 5 was 100 feet east of Test Pit 4 at the same distance from the beach, and was 5 feet square; Test Pit 6 was 350 feet farther east, 15 feet from the shore, and 5 feet square; Test Pit 7 was 40 feet farther east, 15 feet from the bank, and 7 by 8 feet in size. The stratification (Fig. 3 d) in all seven pits showed two major culture-bearing strata. Stra- tum I is a dark, organic, clay-like soil lying im- mediately over the yellow clay or gravel subsoil. It contains no shellfish remains and varies from 1 to 2 feet in thickness.

It varied from 0.5 to 3.5 feet in thickness. Artifacts and cultural detritus were found from the top of the subsoil to the surface. The upper portion of Stratum II had been plowed so that the shell was very frag- mentary and mixed with an occasional modern intrusion. The undisturbed portion contained areas of almost solid whole shell. Some layering is present in Stratum I, but I am not sure what it means. A layer of gravel separated the two major strata in Test Pit 5. Quantities of fish and mammal bone were found in both strata. Shallow fire pits were found in Test Pits 4 and 6. In Test Pit 4 the fire pit consisted of a semi- circular formation of fire-cracked rock at the edge of a small pit filled with sand, charcoal, and bone fragments. The pit was 8 inches deep and 18 inches wide. It was completely within Stratum I. Another more or less circular stone formation with a diameter of 1.9 feet and a fill of mammal bone and charcoal was in Stratum II in Test Pit 6. Fire-cracked rock occurred in all strata. Two burials were encountered in Test Pit 7. Burial 1 was intruded into the yellow clay sub- soil in a shallow pit, about 1 foot below the surface of the yellow clay. The skeleton lay on the left side in a semiflexed position with the right arm extending over and across the pelvis. The skull pointed to the west and faced north. The skeleton was covered with yellow clay ex- cept for the knees which were covered with dark dirt containing shell. The borrow material from the burial pit was deposited prior to the build-up of Stratum II. The skull of Burial 2 lay 1 foot to the southwest of Burial 1 and was 8 inches above it. The skull, right scapula, right humerus, right radius, right ulna, and right hand bones were all that were found of Burial 2. The lower arm bones were charred and there was evidence of a fired area directly above what would have been the pelvic region. The skull pointed north and faced west. Burial 2 had been placed in a 4-inch excavation in the subsoil and was covered with the dark soil of Stratum I. No grave goods were found wtih either skeleton. Both skulls were extremely long-headed. The distribution and frequency of the various artifact types from Argyle Lagoon are shown in Table 2. The artifacts from the East Bluff area of the Cattle Point site are also shown on the same table, but are discussed separately in the section devoted to that site. Chipped stone projectile points are the most numerous type of artifact from this site. The following types were found: Argyle Lagoon stemmed (Fig. 5 D, f-t) points have a convex- sided blade, usually sloping shoulders, and are always unbarbed. In four specimens true shoul- ders are lacking. The stem may be either con- tracting, expanding, or straight. I consider the types shown by King (1950, Fig. 9, 10-16) to be of this generalized type. All are chipped from dense basalt with the exception of one (Fig. 5 D, p) which is made of yellow chalcedony. An- other (Fig. 5 D, f) is heavily patinated probably from beach rolling although it was found in situ in the site. San Juan stemmed and barbed points, leaf-shaped points, and the drill conform to the descriptions given previously for the Gar- rison site. The leaf-shaped knife (Fig. 5 D, w) is well made. The flake knives are simply ba- salt flakes with cutting edges and the flake scrap- ers are simple flakes with scraping edges. One of the latter is made of chalcedony, the other of basalt. The lamellar microblades and polyhedral core are of different materials. The core is a quartz crystal from which four blades have been re- moved leaving four long flake scars. Both blades are fragmentary and are made of obsidian. See the discussion of these implements in the Cattle Point section which follows. Bone awls conform to the previous descrip- tions. The bone needle has an elongate eye sawed or ground (not drilled) from both sides, a rectanguloid section, and a broken point. The bone chisels are fragmentary. One (Fig. 4 F, j) has a curved asymmetric bit. The tooth pendants consist of one small in- cisor from the plow-disturbed portion of Stratum II, which is perforated for suspension, and a canine with surface grinding which shows no means of attachment other than the natural constriction near the root. The antler harpoon basal fragment (Fig. 4 F, d) differs from the typical antler harpoons with tang and lateral-line guards, but may tenta- tively be placed in this category. The antler haft is made of a forked deer-antler tine slotted at one end for what was probably a stemmed and shouldered knife. The slot itself forms the mouth of a face behind which is incised an eye. A series of incised wavy lines runs out from the eye. One of the forked ends is very blunt and could have served as a flaker. 572 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960</page><page sequence="12">CHRONOLOGY IN THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS Ground slate points are represented at this site by one medial fragment of a thin point which came from the plow-disturbed portion of Stratum II. The cross section is a flattened oval. Two local collections include artifacts which were reported to have come from this site. The Anderson collection contains four large, ground slate, projectile points with hexagonal cross sec- tions; one chipped stone point of milky quartz; one barbed bone or antler projectile point; and one perforated net sinker. These were reported to have come from the general area of Test Pit 5 from near the surface. The Taylor collection contains two stemmed and barbed chipped stone points; two hand mauls; two adz blades; two chipped stone knives; two large ground stone points; one grooved canine pendant; one end perforated canoe anchor; one perforated net sinker; one barbed bone or antler point; and one crude stone bowl. It is uncertain whether all of these artifacts come from this site. This site is somewhat remarkable in contain- ing a thick culture-bearing stratum resting on glacial subsoil in which no shellfish remains were found. Correlated with its location on a lagoon with abundant shellfish beds, this is even more remarkable. The absence of shell in a coast midden could be the result of one of sev- eral factors: (1) the utilization of shellfish was not part of the culture pattern of the group which occupied the site; (2) shellfish did not exist in adjacent waters at the time the cultural complex was deposited; (3) shellfish were utilized, but shucked elsewhere. A more ex- tended excavation of this site might produce a definite answer to one of these suggestions. The present limited excavation does not in- dicate major stratigraphic differences in artifact types. The large number of chipped stone pro- jectile points and the quantities of land mam- mal bone (Table 4) point to a landward orien- tation of the culture, although it must be kept in mind that the cultural setting is on an island. The Argyle Lagoon stemmed points are most common in the "Island," "Maritime," and "De- velopmental" phases at Cattle Point and are absent in the "Late" phase. Lamellar micro- blades are also found in this context and the Argyle Lagoon finds relate most favorably there. It must be remembered also, that no shellfish remains were found in "Island" phase strata. The component from Argyle Lagoon suggests certain similarities with the Marpole phase, but also certain differences. The main similarities are the great frequency of chipped stone points and the occurrence of a problematical Marpole type harpoon in the upper stratum. The stemmed projectile points from Argyle Lagoon, however, are so different from those from Gar- rison, which is certainly Marpole phase, that it is impossible at present to place the two sites in the same phase. Possibly when the projectile points from the Marpole site itself are described in detail more evidence of relationship will be seen. Bryan (1957: 8) suggests that there is a relationship between the Deception Pass phase in the Skagit-Whidbey area to the south of the San Juans and the Argyle Lagoon I component. The Deception Pass phase itself has leaf- and triangular-shaped points of basalt, cobble chop- pers, and a paucity of bone tools associated with an almost complete lack of shellfish remains in 2 feet of cultural deposit, but is unfortunately known from only a very small sample. There is also the possibility of relationship with the Whalen II phase (Borden 1950: 20) which numbers lamellar blades among its common elements and which has a radiocarbon date of A.D. 377 (Daugherty 1958: 454). If the lack of shellfish remains in Argyle Lagoon I is taken as indicative of a non-shellfish using culture, then this phase must be viewed as developmentally and chronologically earlier than this radiocar- bon date, but with a continuity into Argyle La- goon II (and Whalen II ?). Only additional excavation can clarify the situation. Cattle Point Cattle Point (SJ-1) is located on the edge of a natural prairie on the southwest shore of San Juan Island. King (1950) who directed exten- sive excavations at the site during 1946-47 di- vided the site into three distinct areas: (A) West Bluff, (B) East Bluff, and (C) Old Beach. The excavations described here were under- taken the following year and concentrated on the Old Beach and the East Bluff areas. The Old Beach excavation yielded a component identifiable with the San Juan phase and is de- scribed in a later section. The component from the East Bluff is earlier and is described here. The 1948 excavation in the East Bluff area lay between three sections of King's dig, and imme- diately to the east of the trench containing the stone alignment (King 1950: 64-5). The main trenches bisected each other, one running north- south and the other east-west. In addition, a CARLSON] 573</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY diagonal trench was run in a northeast-south- west direction for the purpose of continuing ex- cavation of the stone alignment discovered the preceding season. For the most part the stratification consisted of a single cultural stratum varying from less than 1 to about 4 feet in thickness. This stratum consisted of a heavy, black, sandy humus with scattered shell for the most part, but with oc- casional lenses of concentrated shell (Fig. 3 c). Occasionally this stratum became intensely black and contained only the smallest specks of shell. This was particularly noted in the case of the fill surrounding the stone alignment. It does not appear to represent a distinct cultural deposit. Below the cultural stratum lay a de- posit of stained sand which graded from dark brown to light brown and yellow about a foot below the cultural layer. Lenses of this stained sand are also found within the cultural stratum. In the southern portion of the north-south trench the cultural layer thickens and is di- visible into a stratum of sand and shell and one of little shell that comes to rest on a dense, black, compacted material which probably cor- responds to the "Old Humus" stratum defined by King (1950: 64-5). The stone alignment rests on this level. This "Old Humus" was fol- lowed for about 13 feet north and presumably continued, but could not be checked because of caving sand walls. No artifacts were found either in the "Old Humus" or resting directly upon it. Seven possible post holes were en- countered in the excavation. Four were in line about 1 foot apart; the others were scattered. The four were associated with the "Old Humus" which suggests that this layer may be a house floor and not old humus at all. Three shallow fire pits surrounded by rocks were found inclusive in the cultural stratum in the east- west trench. The portions of the stone align- ment and the clay and rock bowls uncovered that season have already been discussed by King (1950: 64-74). The distribution of the artifacts from the East Bluff of Cattle Point is given in Table 2. Awls and bone chisels do not differ from pre- viously discussed specimens and need no addi- tional comment here. Chipped stone projectile points (IFig. 5 D, x-aa) are all made of basalt. The stemmed points are provisionally classed as Argyle Lagoon stemmed. Lamellar microblades and polyhedral cores were found in fair quantity. Three quartz- crystal cores, seven quartz-crystal microblades, and two obsidain blades were found (Fig. 5 B). Four blades had been removed from each of two cores, and one blade from the third. King (1950: 29) did not distinguish this type of artifact in his analysis of the Cattle Point material, and some of the microblades and cores from his excavation are discussed as worked quartz crystals. A check through his level bags brought to light addi- tional blades and cores. These were distributed as follows: two obsidian blades from the "Is- land" strata and two from the "Maritime" strata of the West Bluff area; one obsidian blade from "Developmental" strata of the East Bluff area and one from the Old Beach; two microblades of quartz crystal, eight fluted quartz-crystal cores, and one problematical obsidian core frag- ment from the East Bluff area. Quartz-crystal fragments which are neither fluted cores nor lamellar microblades were distributed as fol- lows: ten from the West Bluff area, one from the Old Beach, and eight from the East Bluff area. The barbed bone spear point (Fig. 5 E, o) is fragmentary, but shows a small, enclosed barb. It appears to be made of sea mammal bone, but this is difficult to tell for sure as it is charred. The bone needles have a rectanguloid section, but lack the points. In one case the eye is cut or sawed in from both sides; the other is broken through the perforation. The bone wedge is made from a piece of long bone and must have been fashioned in the following manner: the bone was broken or sawed transversely and then one of the resulting halves was sawed and split longitudinally through the epiphysis; the epi- physis was ground on the top and on the sides to form the striking platform, and the other end was ground and sharpened to form the bit. Most of the bit is broken off. The bone knife is of split long bone and is identical to one shown by King (1950, Fig. 14, 9). Miscellaneous bone objects include three worked bone fragments, a bird bone with a beveled end, the tip of a flat pointed object, and a fragment of an elongate bone object with rectanguloid section. The ground slate points (Fig. 5 E, I-n, q) are all thick (0.17 to 0.35 inch) with covex sides. Three have a hexagonal and one an oval section. One has a base noticeably thinned for hafting. Perforated net sinkers were made from small cobbles. All are fragmentary and five are un- finished, suggesting that they were broken in the 574 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960</page><page sequence="14">CHRONOLOGY IN THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS TABLE 2.

The perforations are central, pecked, and biconical. Whetstones are small, irregular pieces of sandstone. These were undoubtedly used for shaping artifacts as well as sharpening them. Miscellaneous ground stone consists of the following specimens: one schist fragment; one slate fragment; one thick rectan- guloid slate blank; one small ovoid pebble abraded on both sides; one shale fragment in- cised with a zigzag design; one small flake of obsidian ground on the edge; a tip of a stone club which was found on the surface; and one ovoid beach cobble stained red. The antler gouge closely resembles a minia- ture wedge and has a rounded asymmetrically beveled bit. It is made from the tine of a deer antler. Mytilus californianus shell artifacts con- sist of one fragmentary specimen that has had the hinge removed and the edges ground flat so that it resembles the poll of an adz blade. The bit is broken off. This assemblage from the East Bluff area is startlingly different from that to be discussed for the Old Beach. Four types of arti- facts stand out: perforated net sinkers, lamellar microblades and cores, whetstones, and long thick ground slate points. Stratigraphically, the sandy humus from which these artifacts come would fall into both King's "Maritime" and "De- velopmental" phases. The few artifacts found were distributed in all parts of the excavation and the distribution suggests that all the major types are culturally and temporally related. ----~------------~----~---- ---~- -- -- -- -- --- --- - ----- -------- --- .---------------- -- - - - - -- - CARLSON] 575</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY However, the general appearance of the area suggests that this is the periphery of the site, and that we are dealing with sporadic occupation. A check on the distribution of these main artifact types with the use of King's field notes shows that the lamellar microblades and cores, the long heavy ground slate points, and the per- forated sinkers were all concentrated in the East Bluff area. Of the 14 long, leaf-shaped, ground slate points figured by King (1950, Fig. 11, 6-10) two come from the "Island" phase of the West Bluff area and eleven from the "Developmental" and "Maritime" phases of the East Bluff area. The fourteenth point of this type was placed in the "Developmental" phase, but came from a level which included upper "Island" and lower "Developmental" strata in the West Bluff area. Of the 63 perforated (complete or incomplete) net sinkers and canoe anchors, 43 came from the East Bluff area, 14 from the West Bluff area, and six from the Old Beach. The distribution of microblades and cores has already been mentioned. Possibly there were greater horizontal than vertical dif- ferences between the East and West Bluff areas. SAN JUAN PHASE SITES The following sites contain components be- longing to the San Juan phase: Jekyll's Lagoon (SJ-3), Turn Point (SJ-4), Lime Kiln (SJ-99), Moore (SJ-5), Mackaye (SJ-186), and Cattle Point (SJ-1). Jekyll's Lagoon Jekyll's Lagoon is a small shellmound located on the northeast shore of Jekyll's Lagoon, a small indentation on the southeastern shore of San Juan Island. The lagoon is almost enclosed by a long gravel spit which has a narrow open- ing at its western end. Floral cover is limited to weeds and thistle on the site itself, although excellent stands of fir and cedar cover the slopes surrounding the lagoon. Shellfish are found in the flats and bars of the lagoon. The site is on the approximate boundary between Samish and Lummi territory, but there is no ethnohistorical information concerning its use. Shell deposits occur on both sides of the narrow entrance to the lagoon, and on a small peninsula which juts out into the lagoon from the eastern shore. The northeastern shell deposits, located at the junc- tion of the spit and the shore, appeared to con- tain the deepest deposits and were tested with one trench, 40 by 5 feet, and seven test pits. The test pits were situated in order to sample the structure of the mound and to determine the actual extent of the cultural deposit. The culture-bearing strata averaged about 2.5 feet in depth and varied from 1 to 3.5 feet. The stratigraphy is basically similar through- out the site and consists of layers of predomi- nantly whole shell separated by layers of beach gravel. Four culture-bearing strata were found in the main trench (Fig. 3 a) and in Test Pits 1, 2, and 7, although no artifacts were obtained from the lowest stratum except in Test Pit 2. Stratum I immediately above the sterile beach gravel consists of a black dirt matrix containing pulverized and partly decomposed shell com- pacted into a dense, almost homogeneous mass. Mytilus edulis is the dominant shell. Charcoal and animal bone were found in limited quanti- ties. A thin, brown-black matrix of clay, gravel, and sand separates Stratum I from Stratum II, which consists of a gray-black matrix of dirt containing large amounts of densely compacted whole shell. Mammal and fish bones are few and widely distributed. A thin layer of gravel in a gray-black and occasionally yellow sand matrix with occasional shell intrusions separates Strata II and III. Stratum III consists of a gray- black dirt containing great amounts of densely compacted whole shell and a moderate amount of mammal and fish bone. In the seaward por- tion of the trench and in Test Pits 1, 2, and 7 a thin layer of gravel separates Strata III and IV. Stratum IV consists of a loose, gray-black ma- trix of dirt and well fragmented shell which grades into a thin humus cover. Test Pits 3 and 4 had only one layer of humus and loose shell above sterile beach gravel. Test Pit 6 contained no artifacts and showed a layer of dense shell containing large fragments of charcoal and burned sand over beach gravels. Test Pit 5 produced two shell layers separated by a gravel layer. The only artifacts came from the upper shell layer. Habitation features were few and poorly de- fined. A small pit intruded from Stratum IV into Stratum III in Test Pit 1. It measured 1.5 feet across the top and sloped to a rounded bottom about 0.5 feet across. A large ash ac- cumulation was found in the upper end of the main trench in Stratum IV. The site suggests essentially four and possibly five periods of occupation with no apparent culture change between them. Plotting the arti- facts failed to reveal any significant distribu- 576 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960</page><page sequence="16">CHRONOLOGY IN THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS tional differences. The gravel layers which were sterile of artifacts are probably the result of storms and high tides during the winter months. Most of the artifacts, which are discussed in a later section, are associated with hunting and fishing activities. Only a few are related to manufacturing activities which suggests that the site was probably a temporary camp occupied primarily in summer. The absence of heavy humus cover and of forest cover, as well as the artifact assemblage, are indicative of the recency of the occupation. Turn Point Turn Point (SJ-4) is the badly eroded rem- nant of a large shell midden located in a small bay off Turn Point on the eastern side of San Juan Island. Shell is exposed in a 50-foot ex- posure on the mainland and in a 25-foot expo- sure on a small island connected by a gravel bar. The beach is good and the area is protected from winds. The site probably once extended across the gravel bar and has been subsequently washed away. There is no ethnographic infor- mation concerning use of the site. A single 5-foot square test pit was sunk into the midden. The depth of the deposit is 3 feet and consists of 14 thin, loose, layers of whole and fragmented shell, urchin, ash, and fish and mammal bone. A large whale scapula was found in association with several large rocks and ash in the upper foot. The artifact yield was not significant but along with the physical stratigraphy indicates that the site is late. Fur- ther excavation was not recommended. Lime Kiln Lime Kiln (SJ-99) is located on the west coast of San Juan Island. It is a shell deposit located on a 25 degree slope area on a rocky bluff overlooking Haro Strait. Outcroppings of rock occur all over the slope and the deposit is thin and scattered. The cliff is approximately 25 feet above the water, but the beach could have been reached by what appears to be a na- tural stairway in the rock wall. The site was chosen for testing as it is one of the few sites on the rocky coast of the island and because the surface finds were promising. Four test pits were sunk into the site and exposed a cultural layer consisting of shell, ash, and humus overlying sterile yellow clay. The deposit averaged 1.5 feet in depth. Three small posts with diameters of about 0.2 feet were found in a row extending into the subsoil. Two medium sized rocks were adjacent to the posts. The site suggests sporadic occupation and most of the artifacts belong to the San Juan phase. A large chipped basalt projectile point which was found at a depth of 15 inches undoubtedly is earlier. Moore Moore (SJ-5) is located in the garden plot of Vincent Moore on the shore of a small bay on the eastern side of San Juan Island. The site is on a bank from 1 to 7 feet above the present beach level. The relief of the property is a gentle slope to the south until it is intersected by a small seasonal stream. Springs exist in both the woods to the north of the site and to the south. Shell deposits extend from the stream north to the wooded area beyond the excava- tion. Shellfish occur in the bay, although it is not considered a particularly good clamming beach by the White residents. The site lies in Lummi territory and the owners stated that Lummi (?) Indians gathered moss in the woods just to the north of the site in 1945. Five trenches of varying sizes (Fig. 6) were excavated into the midden. Stratigraphically the site is very simple. The over-all cultural deposit appears as one stratum and does not exceed a depth of 1.5 feet. The stratum con- sists of a deposit of humus, rock, shell, char- coal, and fish, mammal, and bird bones. The FIG. 6. Plan of excavated areas at Moore. CARLSON ] 577</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY upper foot of the deposit has been plowed and the shell reduced to small fragments. Whole shell occurs below the plow zone in a few places. The subsoil consists of either the typical yellow clay which underlies most sites in this area or an orange clay containing an extensive amount of charcoal and burned vege- tal matter. Both are sterile. The top of the sub- soil is dotted with the root patterns of former trees containing partially burned and decayed wood. Shell intrudes into some of these holes. Habitation features consist of one fire pit, two hearths, and one small charred post. The small fire pit was intruded into the yellow clay. It is 1.3 feet long, 0.55 foot wide, and 0.50 foot deep, and is filled with small round cooking stones and charcoal. One hearth consists of a semicircle of rocks around a concentration of small rocks and charcoal and the other of a small mound of ash, charcoal, fire-cracked rock, and shell. A small charred post with a diameter of 0.3 foot extends into the sterile subsoil for 0.5 foot. The lack of evidence of houses and the shal- low deposit suggest that this too was only a camp site. The artifact assemblage while highly fragmented shows that the site belongs to the San Juan phase although two chipped basalt artifacts are probably intrusive from an earlier period. In addition to the artifacts found during excavation there were several which Moore had gathered during gardening: three thin, partially ground, fragments of slate which appear to be fragments of knives; two ground slate fragments with an abrupt double bevel on the edge suggest portions of points or blades for composite har- poons; one barbed bone point fragment; and several other fragmentary items. Mackaye Mackaye (SJ-186) is a shell midden located on Mackaye Harbor, a large bay on the south- west end of Lopez Island in historic Samish territory. Present cover is limited to grass al- though the site has been plowed. The site itself is in the form of a low mound which is partially obliterated by a road which cuts between it and the beach. Modern occupation has obliterated much of the site. The site was tested with three test pits, 15 by 5 feet, and another 5 feet square. The test pits were 5 feet, 10 feet, and 25 feet apart. The main stratigraphic distinction is between a lower stratum of predominantly whole shell, and an upper plow-disturbed stratum of fragmented shell and black dirt. A thin, but dense, band of black sandy dirt separates the shell midden from the underlying yellow clay subsoil. The test pit nearest the beach was somewhat dis- tinctive in containing a number of thin, discon- tinuous, horizontal lenses of sand which gave the profile a peculiar banded appearance. This may be the result of greater proximity to the beach and occasional high tides. Depth of the deposit varies from 1.4 to 3.75 feet. Distinct habitation features were few and in- definite. Concentrations of rocks associated with burned shell, ash, and charcoal occurred in all test pits. In the north wall of Test Pit 2 the remains of what may be a post hole extend from the cultural stratum into the subsoil. Cattle Point The Old Beach at Cattle Point had been ex- cavated by King (1950) and the reader is ad- vised to check his report for a general descrip- tion of the site. His work was supplemented by five test pits in the west and central portions of the Old Beach. On the eastern portion of the beach a T-shaped trench was excavated through the center of a low mound. King's datum (1950, Fig. 1) was used and the north- south trench ran from 83 to 133 feet north of the datum at 112 to 117 feet east of the datum; the east-west trench joined it at 107 to 112 feet north, and ran from 117 to 137 feet east. The beach test pits were scattered and produced no significant features, only a single stratum of shell and organic debris resting on beach gravel. The beach mound, however, shows three strata of dark humic sand containing shell separated by layers of yellow beach sand. All of the arti- facts came from the upper stratum with the ex- ception of one fragment of chipped and ground slate which came from the lowest layer and two bone awls which came from either the upper or the middle stratum. The upper stratum is com- posed of thick, black, humic sand containing lenses of clam, mussel, and sea-urchin shell and varies from 1 to 1.5 feet in thickness. The other two strata are similar, but not so thick. A gen- eral view of the area suggests that the beach east of the datum point was once a lagoon which opened at the east end where the terrace comes to the water.

The top layer suggests longer use after the spit was built high to protect the site from washing by the sea, and abandonment during or prior to the filling of the lagoon. Artifacts from San Juan Phase Sites The following artifact types were recovered from the sites just discussed. The distribution by site is given in Table 3. Fragmentary speci- mens are included in the analysis when their identification is reasonably certain. Barbed bone arrow points (Fig. 4 E, o-v) con- sist of long, narrow, unilaterally barbed points with either a wedge-shaped or conical butt for insertion into the cleft end of a wooden shaft or foreshaft. The cross section varies from ovoid to rectanguloid. The barbs are frequently only simple notches and in no case do they flare widely from the body of the artifact. One speci- men (Fig. 4 E, o) has an incised line running longitudinally down both sides near the barbed edge and horizontal lines incised into the top of the barbs. All specimens are of land mam- mal bone, probably deer or elk. Barbed bone spear points (Fig. 4 E, i-n) are large, wide, uni- laterally barbed points which are either plano- convex in cross section thus permitting scarfing of the flat side against the wooden foreshaft of the large multiple pointed duck spear or with a base thinned for insertion into the foreshaft. The five specimens (Fig. 4 E, i-l) from the Lime Kiln site were found on the surface and were donated to the field party. One of them is represented by a base fragment only. I suspect they consti- tute the remains of a single artifact, a duck spear. One specimen (Fig. 4 E, m) has an in- cised line running down both sides near the barbs. It is doubtful if any of these points func- tioned as leister points because the historic leister type in this area used points made up of a single separate bone barb hafted to a foreshaft. All are made of land mammal bone. Flat toggle points (Fig. 4 E, a, b) consist of small bone points with a thin, squared or rounded, wedge-shaped butt and a flat, rectan- guloid cross section. They probably served as blades for the type of composite toggling har- poon with a flat blade bed. Round toggle points CARLSON] 579</page><page sequence="19">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (Fig. 4 E, c) consist of small bipointed bone points with a circular or ovoid cross section and an abrupt tip. They probably functioned as the point for the composite toggling harpoon with a rounded blade bed. Snyder (1956, P1. 5) illus- trates a small composite toggle head found armed with a point of this type. Unbarbed bone projectile points (Fig. 4 E, d-h) show sev- eral different forms. Of the seven specimens three have a rectanguloid cross section and a flat, ground butt (Fig. 4 E, f-h); one has an abrupt tip which rapidly thins to a wedge shaped butt (Fig. 4 E, e); one has the tip missing and the base thinned from one side for scarfing against a shaft; one is very short and has a diamond-shaped cross section (Fig. 4 E, d); and the last has a thick squared base which tapers to a rounded point. Salmon-hook barbs consist of two types. Small bipointed bone barbs which show wear on one end only and which taper from a thick center are the only candidates for the salmon hook described in the literature (Fig. 4 D, h-j). In cross section the lower half on this barb is either rectanguloid or plano-convex with at least one flat side for scarfing against the shank of the hook. The point is circular in cross section and is slightly longer than the base. King (1950, Fig. 13 10, 13) illustrates this type. This same type of barb could have functioned as the barb for the historic leister. Thin, bipointed or rounded base bird-bone splinter barbs (Fig. 4 D, a-c) are also salmon-hook barbs. Identical speci- mens can be seen hafted to historic Tlingit salmon hooks (Washington State Museum cata- logue numbers, 1886, 1326, 1329). The excava- tions yielded 25 of the first type and seven of the latter. Halibut-hook barbs (Fig. 4 D, f, g) are difficult to identify. On historic specimens the barb consists of a bipointed bone with a circular cross section hafted against the side of the U-shaped halibut hook. The specimens categorized here as halibut hooks conform to this pattern, but the butt portion of the barb is poorly worked. Herring-rake barbs (Fig. 4 D, d, e) are small, symmetric bone barbs with a circular cross section and a fairly abrupt wedge- shaped butt. Their historic counterparts are iron nails. Ulna awls (Fig. 4 A, f, g) are one of the most numerous items found here archaeologically. All of the excavated specimens are made of deer ulnae. Distinguishing between ulna awls and ulna knives is difficult. None of them from the San Juans are actually sharp enough for slitting a fish as Drucker (1943: 52) suggests. The tip is usually dull and slightly rounded al- though one specimen (Fig. 4 B, f) has a screw- driver-shaped tip. They were undoubtedly multipurpose tools. Bone splinter awls are elongated and pointed bone objects which show shaping or wear only at the tip. Some may be unfinished barbs for composite fish hooks. Split mammal bone awls (Fig. 4 B, c, d) are distin- guished from the preceding category by over-all working of the shaft. Five specimens have the epiphysis modified and the other two have it removed completely. Composite toggling harpoon heads are made up of three pieces: two valves made of bone or antler, and a single point or blade made of bone, ground stone, or ground shell. The blade bed, meaning the portion of the valve designed to hold the blade, may be either flat for a blade which has a flattened cross section or round for a blade with a rounded cross section. The toggling or turning action is accomplished by attaching the harpoon line on the side of the harpoon head so that when the line is taut, the head automatically turns. Small toggle heads were used with salmon harpoons, larger ones with seal harpoons, and even larger ones with whale harpoons. Only two specimens were re- covered from the excavations and these were unfinished. Possibly this is due to sampling error as more specimens were to be expected. Bone chisels do not form a homogeneous class. The specimen from the Moore site is badly weathered, but suggests a chisel; the specimen from Jekyll's Lagoon (Fig. 4 A, c) more closely resembles a knife, but the bit is broken; both specimens from the Old Beach at Cattle Point are broken, but are of the same type (Fig. 4 A, a). One of them was re-used as an awl. This type is made of split long bone which has been ground so that the split side is flat, possibly for hafting as the historic D-adz is hafted. Miscellaneous bone artifacts which are not conveniently categorized consist primarily of fragmentary specimens. The most common group is made up of fragments of elongate bone objects. These must be parts of awls, bone points, or fish hooks. They are distributed as follows: 14 from Jekyll's Lagoon, one from Turn Point, 16 from the Moore site of which five are wedge-shaped bases of bone points, nine from the Mackaye site, and one from the Old Beach at Cattle Point. Other specimens consist of an 580 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960</page><page sequence="20">CHRONOLOGY IN THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS obliquely beveled tip of what was probably a bird-bone needle, a polished mammalian rib, a large elk-scapula digging tool with the proximal end hacked off and the transverse spine ground down, and a curved pointed fragment which may be part of a blanket pin. These are all from Mackaye. Other objects include one polished tubular bird-bone object broken at both ends, another ground on one end and broken on the other, and six worked bone fragments. Antler wedges (Fig. 4 A, b) were used in the wood working industry for making canoes, house planks, and so forth. Only two of the excavated specimens are complete. Both have a rounded bit and taper asymmetrically from the butt. Miscellaneous antler artifacts consist of the fol- lowing: a tine with the tip hacked and smoothed and the proximal end broken; a polished, taper- ing curved tine with a triangular projection on side of the proximal end (Fig. 4 B, h); two frag- ments of elongate objects; a small rectanguloid piece of cut antler; a weathered tine with what appears to be a conical socket in the proximal end; a distal end of an antler which has been grooved three-fourths of the way around; and one haft (Fig. 4 A, e) formed from the proxi- mal end of an elk antler. The haft was shaped by hacking and cutting rather than by grinding and polishing. Possibly it is incomplete. The field notes state that the small adz blade found at Mackaye fit the haft perfectly, but the speci- men itself is missing. From Cattle Point came a fragment of a blunt rounded antler object. Adz blades are represented by one fragmen- tary specimen, two complete specimens, and one missing specimen. The fragmentary specimen (Fig. 5 E, a) has a straight bit which is beveled both dorsally and ventrally. The saw marks where it had been sawed from the original stone remain. One of the complete specimens (Fig. 5 E, g) is very long and has a slightly curved bit. The bevel is predominantly from one side, and the saw marks are in evidence. The other complete specimen (Fig. 4 A, d) is small, highly polished so that the saw grooves no longer show, and has a slightly curved bit and a poll which tapers to a squared butt. The description and sketch of the missing Mackaye specimen indi- cate that it is of this latter type. Ground slate or schist points (Fig. 5 E, p) are all thin (not more than 0.10 inch thick), leaf- shaped in outline, and beveled to a sharp cut- ting edge. The complete specimen has a straight thinned base, whereas one of the fragmentary ones has a suggestion of a notched base. Two specimens are made of slate, two of schist. Ground slate knives (Fig. 5 E, d) are thin and worked primarily on the curved cutting edge. All specimens are very fragmentary. Whet- stones for grinding and sharpening bone and stone implements should be very common al- though only three specimens occur in San Juan phase sites. The one from Jekyll's Lagoon is a more or less oval piece of slate; the one from Cattle Point a rectangular piece of slate with uneven ends; and the one from Mackaye a square piece of sandstone. All show wear characteristic of use as whetstones. Miscellaneous ground stone artifacts were found at all sites except Moore. Jekyll's Lagoon yielded a rectanguloid piece of slate with one edge worn smooth, but otherwise unmodified, and an unmodified slate fragment which sug- gests the back of a small slate knife. Turn Point produced a small cobble hammerstone. A small V-shaped sandstone cobble showing smoothing on two sides as if it had been used as a saw for cutting nephrite for adz blades was found at Lime Kiln. Two mudstone concretions deco- rated with crude scratched lines, which ran roughly diagonally across one specimen and ran at random on the other, and a small ovoid cobble with one end reduced slightly by pecking were found at Mackaye. From the Old Beach at Cattle Point came a fragment of ground and sawed stone, and a fragment of chipped and ground slate. Chipped stone artifacts are few in number in San Juan phase sites. This is in accord with the ethnographic literature where numerous schol- ars (Boas 1916: 52; Kroeber 1923: 8; Olson 1936: 75; Drucker 1943: 122-4) have com- mented on the absence of stone chipping among historic Northwest Coast Indian groups. No chipped stone was found in the excavations at Jekyll's Lagoon, although one fragment of a bi- facially chipped knife or point of basalt was found on the shore of the lagoon. One large basalt projectile point or knife (Fig. 5 A, e) was found at Lime Kiln at a depth of 15 inches near the subsoil. The Moore site yielded four chipped stone artifacts: one pentagonal point of opalite (Fig. 5 A, c) which is probably a trade piece from the Plateau; a small, leaf-shaped basalt point with serrated edges (Fig. 5 A, d); one long basalt point with an almost diamond-shaped cross section and which exhibits basal grinding (Fig. 5 A, a); and one large flake or blade. This CARLSON] 581</page><page sequence="21">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY flake (Fig. 5 A, b) was found embedded in the top of the subsoil and along with the two pre- ceding points undoubtedly belongs to an earlier manifestation. The Old Beach at Cattle Point produced 13 chipped basalt artifacts and one unmodified chip of milky quartz. This amount is not commen- surate with the small quantity found at other sites. They consist of the following specimens: one small triangular point with a concave base and side notches (Fig. 5 A, f); two small un- notched triangular points with straight and con- cave bases respectively (Fig. 5 A, g, i); one me- dial fragment of a small narrow projectile point; one pentagonal point, or viewed the other way, stemmed knife (Fig. 5 A, h); three fragments of projectile points or knives; three small crude flakes of basalt with scraping edges; one large, crude, percussion-chipped, basalt slab or club; and one basalt core. The presence of chipped stone and chipping detritus in limited quanti- ties suggests that this site belongs to an early portion of the San Juan phase deposited as chipped stone was going into disuse. Actually, the late phase which King (1950) outlined for Cattle Point corresponds reasonably well to the San Juan phase outlined in this study if the great numbers of chipped stone points from the surface are separated from those actually un- covered in the late deposits. A review of King's field notes shows that only seven of the 29 pro- jectile points from his late phase were actually excavated. The others came from the surface where weathering factors preclude the finding of bone implements. Thus the ratio of chipped stone to bone was not established. Future work may justify setting off the Old Beach at Cattle Point into a separate phase preceding that in which stone chipping is lacking entirely, al- though there was some utilization of the Old Beach in historic times; in going through the level bags from King's excavations, I discovered the stem of a white clay trade pipe and a small, sheet copper, triangular pendant in a bag of sur- face finds from the Old Beach. Ground Mytilus californianus shell artifacts are all fragmentary specimens of either knives or scrapers. There were no fragments of either projectile points or adz blades. Miscellaneous worked shell artifacts consist of a small perfo- rated clam shell from Turn Point and a clam shell with a rectanguloid cut notch opposite the hinge from Cattle Point. Ocher or pigment was found at two sites. At Moore two lumps of a pink chalky substance could have been used for pigment. A clam shell filled with pulverized red ocher was uncovered at Mackaye. European goods were found only at Lime Kiln. A circular brass object with a central per- foration around which are small incised lines or "ticking" was found two inches below the sur- face. In summary, the artifacts which are common and typical of the San Juan phase sites discussed here are bone fish hook barbs, barbed bone pro- jectile points, bone awls, and miscellaneous worked bone. Artifacts which are typical, but less common are composite toggling harpoons, bone chisels, antler wedges, ground and polished "jadeite" adz blades, ground slate knives, whet- stones, and ground Mytilus californianus shell knives and scrapers. Grinding and polishing are the important manufacturing techniques. Arti- facts which are found but which are not typical are chipped stone artifacts which in some in- stances are clearly intrusive and in other in- stances are indicative of a slightly earlier time period. FAUNAL REMAINS Fish remains are common in all strata of all sites. A. D. Welander, Department of Fisheries, University of Washington, identified the follow- ing species: rockfish (Sebastodes) were the most common bones identified, and occur in all sites; the dogfish (Squalus acauthias) was identified by the dorsal fin spine which occurs in all sites; sculpin (family Cottidae, probably Scorpaenich- thys) occurs at SJ-3, SJ-5, and questionably at SJ-25, SJ-185, and SJ-186; ling cod (Ophio- don) were found at SJ-2, SJ-3, SJ-5, and ques- tionably at SJ-25; bones of a cod-like fish, prob- ably Myoxecephalus, occur at SJ-2 and SJ-3; skate (Raja) is represented by a single bone from SJ-5. It was not possible to have any of the fish vertebrae, which are the most common fish bone found, identified. Many of them un- doubtedly belong to the salmon which formed the mainstay of the historic Indian groups. Bird remains are plentiful in all sites but iden- tification was limited by time and the compara- tive material at hand. William Goodge (then at the Washington State Museum) identified the following: sea gull from SJ-25 and SJ-185; puffin from SJ-3; murre from SJ-185 and SJ-2; goose from SJ-3, SJ-25, and SJ-185; cormorant 582 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960</page><page sequence="22">CHRONOLOGY IN THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS TABLE 4.

Shellfish remains form the greatest bulk of the faunal remains. Estimates taken in the field indicate that the various species of clam (Saxi- domus giganteus, Schizothaerus nutalli, Proto- thaca staminea, and Macoma nasuta) predomi. nate except possibly at Cattle Point where they occur, but in unknown frequency. Mussel were very common at SJ-3 and SJ-5. Saucer-shaped lenses of sea-urchin (Strongylocentrotus sp.) spines were found at all sites. Other species are of minor occurrence. Mammalian remains occur in considerable quantity at all sites, but are most common at Argyle Lagoon. They were identified by com- parison with the osteological collection at the Washington State Museum. No attempt was made to identify any ribs or vertebrae. The dis- tribution and frequency are given in Table 4. Unfortunately the level bags from the main trench at SJ-3 were missing so no total count could be made. Of the 11 sea lion bones from SJ-25, ten probably belong to the same animal. These ten were found associated in Layer IIIb. The other bone came from Layer II. CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURE CHANGE The prehistory of the San Juan Islands from the Marpole phase in the first millennium B.C. to historic times has been described, and will now be discussed in the context of the pre- history of the Pacific Northwest in general. There was undoubtedly some occupation in the islands prior to Argyle Lagoon I or the Marpole phase component at Garrison, whichever is earlier, even though there is no concrete evi- dence of it. The southern terminus of the last glaciation, the Vashon, which is probably equiv- alent to the last maximum of the Wisconsin, the Mankato, is only about 200 miles to the south (Hanson 1947: 34). Logically any popula- tions living on the fringes of the glacier would gradually follow as it receded. The early post- glacial climatic conditions west of the Cascades were probably little different from those near the margins of the present day Alaskan glaciers and the forests probably advanced rapidly as the glaciers retreated (Hanson 1947: 113). Small groups wandering gradually northward as the areas became free of ice, as the forests grew, and as the salmon began their annual migrations up the rivers probably moved out into the is- lands. Fishing techniques may have already been in use as a result of adaptation to lake and river environments in adjacent unglaciated areas, although there is no artifactual evidence for this. There is a growing body of evidence for this first stage in the Pacific Northwest. Cressman (1957) has some evidence of peri- glacial occupation at Five-Mile Rapids on the lower Columbia starting some 11,000 years ago, followed by levels where site geography as well as the presence of thousands of fish bones clearly show a fishing culture. Borden has another early culture at DjRi3 on the Fraser River dated at about 6000 B.C. where the occupants were certainly making use of the fish resources of the river although site geo- CARLSON] 583</page><page sequence="23">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY graphy is the only clue to this practice. Neither site shows specific artifacts adapted to a fishing complex, but one must keep in mind that fish nets which are still widely used by the aborig- ines in these areas usually leave no archaeologi- cal traces. Perforated stones found at Cattle Point and other sites are interpreted as net sink- ers, and I think rightly so, although the historic type of net sinker in the San Juans is an un- worked egg shaped stone (Suttles 1951: 134). This is probably true elsewhere also. Wiers, basket traps, and most specialized fishing equip- ment survive only under conditions of favorable preservation. More evidence of early occupation comes from the Lind Coulee site in eastern Washing- ton where by about 7000 B.C., judging from the radiocarbon dates, man was camped by a slug- gish stream or lake and eating bison meat not long after ice rafts had dropped boulders in the same deposit (Daugherty 1956: 234). The chip- ping industries from these sites consist of lan- ceolate points, knives, scrapers, and choppers which show a generalized relationship with other cultures of North America on this time level. In addition a barbed bone harpoon frag- ment from Lind Coulee and a small unilaterally barbed bone point from the early level of Five- Mile Rapids show the existence already at this early time in the Northwest of a class of arti- facts which became much more important in the Marpole phase and later phases in Puget Sound and the Gulf of Georgia. The time period between these early cultures and the Marpole phase is poorly known. The Five-Mile Rapids sites continue through this period and in Puget Sound the Deception Pass phase (Bryan 1957) probably belongs here, but they give no clue to what was happening in the Northwest to produce the Marpole phase. The factors which are most likely involved are a progressive adaptation to the environment coupled with the development in the Mesolithic and Neolithic cultures of the Old World of the customs of using and manufacturing artifacts of horn, bone, and stone by sawing, abrading, and polishing techniques, and the diffusion of those techniques and artifacts to the cultures of this area. Types differ, but change is a natural consequence of distance in time and space. In the Neolithic of Lake Baikal in Siberia in the Serovo period (3rd millennium B.C.) barbed har- poons with tang and lateral line guards were in use as well as polished adz blades and ground slate knives; in the following Kitoi period (2500- 1700 B.C.) sawing of nephrite with slate saws appears (Michael 1958). The introduction of these items plus internal developments help account for the emergence of Marpole. Culture change within the time period covered by the excavations, that is between the Marpole and San Juan phases, is expressed both by the changes in the items of material culture and by differences in adaptation to the environ- ment. Presumably the former is a reflection of the latter. The large numbers of chipped stone projectile points from both Garrison and Argyle Lagoon, correlated with the quantities of land mammal bone from both sites, suggest a marked dependence on land hunting for food. The absence of composite fish hooks suggests either a lesser dependence on fishing or fishing by other than historically known techniques which can be documented archaeologically. One must not forget, however, that the setting is on an island which presupposes water transportation and that fish and sea mammal remains are found in all phases. The lack of shellfish re- mains in the lower strata at both Cattle Point and Argyle Lagoon is an enigma. Arrangement of the sites in a developmental sequence from less maritime adaptation to more maritime adap- tation would certainly make these the earliest. However, the excavations at Argyle Lagoon are not really extensive enough, and too little is known of the manner in which shell middens accumulate to justify the conclusion that shell- fish were not utilized. The loss of the chipped stone industry in the San Juan phase and its replacement by a grinding and polishing indus- try utilizing bone and stone can only be the re- sult of historical processes. This replacement appears to have been a gradual process in which some activities associated with implements of ground stone and bone--namely fishing and sea mammal hunting--gained precedence at the expense of those activities associated with implements of chipped stone - namely land mammal hunting-until stone chipping went out of use completely. The hunting of land mammals itself survived, but with implements more frequently associated with maritime activ- ities. There is no reason to believe that artifacts of chipped stone could not be adapted to a mari- 584 [VOL. 25, No. 4, 1960</page><page sequence="24">CHRONOLOGY IN THE SAN JUAN ISLANDS time economy, so purely functional reasons for this shift must be ruled out. In addition, there is the change from the predominant use of antler as well as chipped stone for projectile points in the Marpole phase to the use of bone in the San Juan phase. In Europe during the late Upper Paleolithic and at Star Carr antler was preferred as a raw material in the manufacture of spear and harpoon points, whereas in the later Magle- mosian, bone was used almost invariably for these same classes of implements (Clark 1954: 181). One cannot but wonder if this parallel sequence is not due to diffusion particularly since there is a scattered distribution suggestive of continuity of barbed bone spear or arrow points across the top of the Old World and south along the western edge of North America. Correspondence in time depth, however, cannot at present be shown. One problem is that in- vestigators do not always distinguish between bone and antler in their descriptions of artifacts. In addition to change there is a certain con- tinuity of culture from the Marpole phase sites to the San Juan phase. At Marpole, Borden has found evidence for a large multi-family dwelling which must certainly be related to if not identi. cal with that of the historic Indian groups. A similar continuity is evident in wood working tools - adzes, mauls, chisels, and wedges. There is a continuity in art style also, but more toward what is considered classic Northwest Coast art than toward historic Salish art. In the preceding paragraphs archaeological remains from the San Juan Islands have been described and discussed, and some hypotheses have been advanced. A fuller picture of the prehistory of the area and its relationships can only be gained by further excavation in the numerous rich shell middens which dot the shores and lagoons. Acknowledgments. This paper is a completely revised and condensed version of a thesis entitled, "Archaeologi- cal Investigations in the San Juan Islands," which was presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts at the University of Wash- ington in 1954. The original was prepared under the direction of Douglas Osborne and Erna Gunther. Six of the sites, SJ-1, SJ-4, SJ-5, SJ-99, and SJ-25 were ex- cavated between 1948 and 1951 by the summer field school in archaeology of the Department of Anthropology of the University of Washington under the direction of Carroll Burroughs. SJ-3 was excavated by Warren W. Caldwell and SJ-185 and SJ-186 by William Liston and Malcolm Forbes, graduate students. I am indebted to Charles Borden, University of British Columbia, for the radiocarbon dates and information on the current Fraser delta sequence, and for many hours of discussion on Northwest prehistory.
