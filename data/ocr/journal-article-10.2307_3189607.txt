<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Charles M. Natoli, Nietzsche and Pascal on Christianity. New York: Peter Lang, 1985. 197 pp. Professor Natoli tells us that he will deal with Nietzsche at much greater length because he himself is in "fundamental agreement with Pascal on many more issues." Nonetheless, before taking up Nietzsche's anti-Christian polem- ics, Natoli gives us a revealing assessment of Pascal's Pensdes from the perspec- tive of contemporary orthodox Christian thought. Not content with elaborating Nietzsche's "reading" of Pascal, Natoli seeks to elucidate "what Pascal was really up to in his apologetics." His concise and cogent summary of the complicated textual and editorial history of the Pensees, grounded in mainstream Pascalian scholarship (Lafuma and Mesnard), carefully avoids any hint of the kind of idiosyncratic interpretations which have so plagued "deconstructive" studies of the Pascalian text in recent years. Natoli says he is "profoundly impressed" by the case Pascal makes for "Christian theism." "Like Pascal," he claims, he is equally impressed by the case which can be made for skepticism. On the other hand, Natoli views Pascal's historical arguments with serious reservations. The chapter "PerpetuitY," for instance, in which Pascal asserts that the Jews constitute the world's most ancient religion and people, cannot be salvaged. Nor will Pascal's system of Biblical exegesis stand the most elementary test of modern Biblical criticism. The themes and arguments constituting Pascal's "war of attrition" against his libertin, Natoli contends, can be thought to "coalesce into a powerful challenge to unbelief." Nevertheless, the Pensees have not stood the test of time as a viable apology for Christianity. The Pascalian text has achieved enduring popularity "not as a proselytizing tool, but as great literature." The Pensees are most often read, not by potential converts, but by those fascinated by Pascal's insight into the human condition and haunted by the "beauty of his expression." Like Nietzsche, the modem reader senses that Pascal spoke so loudly "to reassure himself as well." Natoli devotes a particularly illuminating analysis to Nietzsche's theory of ressentiment. The "slave morality" underlying Christianity, Nietzsche argues, may best be judged by the harm done its "most instructive victim:" Christianity... has depraved the reason even of the intellectually strongest natures by teaching men to feel the supreme values of intellectuali- ty as sinful... The most deplorable example: the depraving of Pascal, who believed that his reason had been depraved by original sin, while it had only been depraved by his Christianity! (The Antichrist)</page><page sequence="2">140 South Central Review When evaluating Nietzsche's reaction to Pascal as apologist, skeptic and ascetic, Professor Natoli cautions, we must constantly bear in mind Nietzsche's curious declaration: "I do not read but love Pascal" (Ecce Homo). Nietzsche, Natoli reminds us, did not have a scholarly knowledge of Pascal and his text. His French was poor, and he read the Pensees in an edition (Faugere, 1844) which obscured Pascal's whole apologetic strategy. Consequently, his attacks on Pas- cal's apologetics often amount to no more than "quick ripostes" and "rather summary counters." Nor is Nietzsche's appreciation of the function of the "vein of skepticism" running through the Pensees altogether exact. Ultimately, Natoli argues, Nietzsche came to consider Pascal as "an extreme ascetic... a great sayer of No! to life." Nietzsche calls Pascal "the only logical Christian" and claims to have Pascal's blood running in his veins. Natoli admits that Nietzsche's "feeling" for Pascal is obviously "overdetermined." However, he tries to convince us that there exists "an affinity of souls" between these two thinkers: "a kinship of outlook, temperament and sensitivity." Both are "masterful stylists," "great intuitive psychologists" and "prototypes of... existentialists." Nietzsche's admiration of Pascal, Natoli proposes, might best be compared to that of the art lover contemplating "a defaced masterpiece." Nietzsche's "affinity" with Pascal is grounded not just in "aesthetic awe" but also in a conviction that Pascal dared face "some very hard 'truths."' In his critique of Nietzsche's anti-Christian polemics, Natoli faults Nietzsche for failing to consider Christianity's "pretentions to historical and metaphysical truth." For Nietzsche, Natoli insists, Christianity is never anything more than a "mere sociological phenomenon." Consequently, Nietzsche's attempt to unseat Christian belief by overthrowing Christian morality amounts to "an out-and-out genetic fallacy." Nietzsche, Natoli concludes, simply lacked the imagination "to see metaphysics or Christianity 'from the inside,' even if only for the purpose of playing the devil's advocate." Natoli stops short of faulting Nietzsche for not seeing "what, in all honesty ... he just could not see." However, he concludes, Nietzsche is "deficient" in a way that Pascal ("alive in a way that few men have ever been to the possibility of a world behind this one") is not: When I look at Nietzsche, I see.., .a man neither at one with himself or with his work.... An apostle of strength and health, Nietzsche was chronic- ally ill.. . a nondescript man who preached greatness.... But most impor- tantly, he trades in what he declares to be contraband...anathematizes religion while lapsing into its forms. He has his own dogmas .... Moreover, his attempt to establish the Eternal Return as a physical theory.., .shows an undeniable and unfulfilled craving to endow the here and now with a significance beyond itself. In a remarkable appendix, "Loose Leaves from the Commonplace Book of a Skeptical Fideist," Natoli directly addresses the question of whether apologetics can sustain modem Christian belief. He admits that two "hoary but still potent" objections constitute the strongest case against Christian theism: "the immorali- ty of God and the apparent contra-rationality of the Christian Mysteries." "Christian belief can, with difficulty, withstand these objections, but the price of avoiding refutation is not small."</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 141 In order to liberate itself from an indefensible "anthropomorphic" Christian God, modem belief must part company with a traditional cornerstone of Christian apologetics: the refutation of rival faiths. To argue in good faith that the Christian sacred texts must be interpreted figuratively, the modern Christian must be prepared to permit adherents of other systems of belief to do likewise. Responding to the "made-to-order" objections constituted by the "patently contra-rational character" of the Christian Mysteries is far more difficult. The modem apologist has a limited number of strategic choices. He can break with traditional orthodoxy. He can attempt to argue that the Mysteries are at least "self-consistent." Or, he can retreat into "utter fideism" and claim that God has set such Mysteries beyond human understanding. However, each of these options has been consistently compromised by modern studies in Comparative Religion. The only way out of this impasse, Natoli asserts, is to invoke "certain dread shades from the rationalists' underworld: the antinomies." Because they pro- vide totally new grounds for challenging the scope and efficacy of reason, the antinomies reopen the possibility of Christian apologetics. The contemporary apologist, thanks to this new impasse in rationalist philosophy, may now contend that "if reason oversteps its competence in dealing with sets and the semantics of natural language, it may equally well if not more likely do so when it seeks to come to grips with God." Natoli is the first to admit that such a strategy might well yield only a Pyrrhic victory. Any doctrine, no matter how absurd, might avail itself of the same argument. However, Natoli concludes: "The orthodox Christian has won this much: he has shown that his belief in the Mysteries is not necessarily irrational, that the problems the antimonies pose leave the possibility of the Mysteries' truth an open question." Natoli's own position appears to be very much like the one he attributes to Pascal: "Pascal is honest; he admits that the matters in question are surpassingly difficult, that the case for Christianity is strong but by no means conclusive, and that nothing could prove it utterly short of the lightnings of the last day." Natoli makes no attempt to disguise his attempt to defend an "orthodox, apparently anti-rational faith." Nor, drawing on his knowledge of philosophy and theology, does he feel constrained to limit his observations to his immediate subject. Not only students of Pascal and Nietzsche, but also those interested in contemporary theology and religious ideas, will find this book thought-provoking and rewarding.
