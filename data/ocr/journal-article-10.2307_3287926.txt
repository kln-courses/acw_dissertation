<plain_text><page sequence="1">LATIN: A LIVE FACTOR IN MENTAL INSURANCE BY SUSAN PAXSON Central High School, Omaha Nine men out of every ten when they die will leave no estate except life insurance, or at least not enough of other assets to save their families from pinching poverty. Thus reads a statement issued recently by our oldest life-insurance company. The fact that no fewer than six American life-insurance companies now have insurance in force to an amount exceeding one billion dollars each, proves that our American working class, in spite of the ever-growing army of the unemployed, is still independent in spirit, willing to save, toil, and sacrifice that those dependent upon them may not become a public charge. This same American spirit makes possible the expenditure of more than $403,ooo,ooo annually in our United States for protective insurance of another kind-the Mental Insur- ance of our youth. However, in spite of this vast expenditure, our latest census returns show that there are 2,373,603 voters in this country who can neither read nor write-enough to hold the balance of power in any national election. Over five and one-half million of our people can neither read nor write, one and one-half million of whom are native born. Fewer than seven out of every one hundred children enter the high school. Since the real value of any country's educational system is determined by the degree to which it is adapted to influence helpfully the practical life of the popula- tion, these figures show to what an extent our nation has failed to bring the light to "the man with the hoe." As teachers, we are agents of this vast Mental Insurance Com- pany and it should be our duty and privilege to ascertain how our own department can be best and most economically maintained, that the company as a whole may be strengthened and that every pupil policyholder may secure the best returns on his investment. Young America (and too often old America) is clamoring today, as never before, for a short route to the educational goal. Nay, 401</page><page sequence="2">402 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL more, they almost refuse to run the race at all unless the course be free from stone and pebble. Sane educators recognize the fact, however, that while steam has beaten Jupiter, and many things, in this age of automobile and aviation, have far surpassed the speed limit of years ago, seedtime and fruition are just as far apart now as in the days of old Methuselah and it still takes time for mental growth. In the life-insurance business, perhaps the most dangerous as well as the most despicable persons are those unscrupulous agents who approach a policyholder urging him to abandon or surrender his present policy with a view to taking out a new one in another company. It is a practice made a misdemeanor in New York and other states. The only remedy for this evil that can be offered by any insurance company is an urgent appeal to the policyholder to confer with the home office of the company before making a change. In the business of mental insurance, the department of Latin is more familiar with the "twister," perhaps, than any other, and his most subtle arguments are that our subject is not "practical," that it takes too much time, and that our policyholders do not receive benefits that fit them for business. These "twisters" boldly argue that one subject is just as good as another and that it does not make much difference what a child studies just so he is studying. Might not one just as sanely argue that it does not make much difference what a child eats just so he is eating? "What are the ingredients that go into the making of a good business man ?" I asked a twister one day. "Oh, most anything that will enable him to earn his living," he replied. "Money's the stuff nowadays, you know." To such a man it would be useless to quote Thoreau, who once said: "Getting a living should be a pastime. We are making it the end of life." It is as much a part of education to teach these children how to live as it is to teach them how to get a living. We must teach them what things to enjoy as well as enable them to get the means of gratifying their tastes; and until we do this popular education will fail, as it has failed in the past. The failure, according to Mr. Charles W. Eliot, is due to inadequacy and misdirection in our educational system. In giving a remedy, Mr. Eliot says: "These, then, are the four things in</page><page sequence="3">LATIN: A LIVE FACTOR IN MENTAL INSURANCE 403 which the individual youth should be thoroughly trained, if his judgment and reasoning power are to be systematically developed: observing accurately; recording correctly; comparing, grouping, and inferring justly; and expressing cogently the results of these mental operations." Is there any other department of this Mental Insurance Company that can offer better or more opportunities for these mental operations, think you, than our own ? Mr. James P. Monroe, well-known business man and educa- tional expert of the Boston Chamber of Commerce, says: "Physical fiber, mental fiber, moral fiber are what education exists to develop in the child; and this fiber can be built up, toughened, and made good for something only by a judicious, daily application of the rod. Not, of course, by the actual rod of the proverbial pedagogue, but by the subtle, invisible, though none the less efficacious, rod of hard work, real persistent effort, and steady discipline. The old edu- cation . . . . with its Latin grammar and more Latin grammar and still more Latin grammar produced a hard-headed, hard-fisted, hard-hearted race, but it was, in the main, a race sound physically, mentally, and morally. Many of the new methods of gentle cooing toward the child's inclinations, of timidly placing a chair for him before a disordered banquet of heterogenous studies, may produce ladylike persons, but they will not produce men."' One might expect such a tribute from a Bostonian who had been well served by the Latin department of our great Mental Insurance Company, but no less sincere is the encomium bestowed by Mr. Joseph R. Pittman, a cotton-broker of Galveston, Texas, who writes: "One whose mind has been exercised in the parsing and construction of involved Latin or Greek sentences, who has been accustomed to analyze them thoroughly and to assimilate their full purport and meaning, will certainly be better able to comprehend and interpret a commercial regulation or business contract and to indite with perfect lucidity of expression a business document than a person who has paid but superficial attention to the art of literary expression. From a personal point of view, I prefer to talk over business matters with a man who has studied the classics. He understands my meaning quickly, and I understand his, and we get SJames P. Monroe, New Demands in Education.</page><page sequence="4">404 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL down to 'brass tacks' (in medias res) with greater dispatch than we probably should if I were conferring with the proverbial man named Smith, who wrote the following note to Mr. Jones: 'Mr. Smith presents his compliments to Mr. Jones, and finds he has a hat that isn't mine, so if you have one that isn't his, perhaps they are the ones.) )" Indeed, it would not be difficult for our home office to keep on file hundreds of such testimonials for the benefit of our Latin policy- holders and for the disillusionment of the twister, for there is a certain class of twisters whose motives in approaching the Latin policyholder seem to be honest. Having had no Latin themselves, or at least only a crumb or two, and not knowing that Latin can never die, they recommend French or German as more practical on the ground of their being live languages. Mr. George Hobart Libby, principal of the Manchester, New Hampshire, High School, says: "Modern languages cannot yield the discipline afforded by the classics. French is all but worthless for a Latin student. It is too easy. German has not a logically developed grammar. Science means too much the following of formulae, typewritten directions, and playing with apparatus; these things are not scientific research nor training of the taste and logical faculties. As to the practical value of the fact that French and German are spoken languages we may be greatly misled. I come from a manufacturing town where more than half the population is French. And yet the practical value of French in my school is not worthy of consideration. In the first place the pupils cannot speak French, and in the next place they wouldn't be understood if they could."' "It is a chronological absurdity," says Mr. Morgan, of Harvard, "to propose to carry pupils for any considerable distance into the study of two modern languages without giving them an idea of the ancient languages which provided the modern with their vocabu- lary." Professor H. H. Boyesen, of Columbia College, who is himself a strong advocate of modern languages, acknowledges the following: "If I were asked whether the mental discipline to be derived from SClassical Journal, III (190o7), 239. SIbid., VI (19o10), 121.</page><page sequence="5">LATIN: A LIVE FACTOR IN MENTAL INSURANCE 405 the acquisition of German or French equaled or could be made to equal that derived from the acquisition of Latin and Greek, I should unhesitatingly answer No! The latter present by far the greater difficulties and the overcoming of these difficulties requires a cor- respondingly greater mental effort which is in itself educative. The puzzling-out of a page in Thucydides or Tacitus calls for greater mental power than the similar deciphering of any modern author."r Of similar purport is the verdict rendered by Dr. M. P. Jacobi, after her investigations in physiological psychology: "The infer- ences demanded of the young child in translating Latin are simply the type of mental acts that are to be demanded of him all his life, and constitute an excellent preparation for these; the logical value of French and German is so much less, because precise knowledge of construction and inflection is unnecessary to their interpretation. * . . . Accordingly, Latin grammar alone should be used to teach grammatical principles, selected in the order of their natural com- prehensibility for the developing mind.'"2 The twister who recommends science to the disparagement of the classics should be referred to a letter written for the London Daily Mail of July 29, 1911, telling of the experience in France, which country, as you know, in obedience to popular clamor resolved to replace the literary education which had held sway for so many centuries by a study of exact science. They kept sternly in view the demands of counting-house and workshop. But that utilitarian system of education has proved a disastrous failure and it is not the men of letters who denounce it most bitterly, but the men of science, the engineers, the captains of industry. "The makers of steel, the inspectors of mines, the chiefs of the medical schools are uniting in a protest against the tyranny of science. They are discovering what they should have known from the begin- ning, that humane letters are the best training even for those who are destined to earn their bread in a factory. Discipline of mind and a clear habit of thought are as necessary in the counting-house as in the study; and when a chief of a vast steel works publicly peti- tions the Minister of Education to bring back the study of Latin I Education, XXIII, 261.

To pass his youth in Arcady is the wisest preparation even for a metallurgist." In the celebrated memorial of the Philosophical Faculty of Berlin, professors of mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, zoilogy, economics, philosophy, English, German, each speaking from the standpoint of his own specialty, pronounced their judgment in the words summed up by Dr. Hofman, Rector of the University of Berlin: "That all efforts to find a substitute for the classical lan- guages, whether in mathematics, in the modern languages, or in the natural sciences, have been thus far unsuccessful; that after long and vain search we must always come back finally to the result of centuries of experience; that the surest instrument that can be used in the training of youth is given us in the study of the languages, the literature, and the works of art of classical antiquity."' Two thousand years ago, when certain Romans ventured to ask why a prospective orator should learn geometry, why learn music, why learn anything outside the strictest limits of his professional calling, Quintilian replied that the object of education was not to train a mediocre orator, but the best, and I know of no better answer for the twisters today than this message from the old Roman school- master. The late Dr. Williams T. Harris, for so many years commissioner of education, than whom there could be no better authority on mental insurance, even goes so far as to say: " Of a hundred boys, fifty of whom had studied Latin for a period of six months, while the others had never studied Latin at all, the fifty with the smatter- ing of Latin would possess some slight impulse toward analyzing the legal and political views of human life, and surpass the other fifty in this direction. Placed on a distant frontier with the task of building a new civilization, the fifty with the smattering of Latin would furnish lawmakers and political rulers, legislators, and builders of the state.""

Ashmore, The Classics and Modern Training, p. 26. 2 Classical Weekly (March 15, 1913).</page><page sequence="7">LATIN: A LIVE FACTOR IN MENTAL INSURANCE 407 Half a billion dollars of life-insurance protection has been taken away from the wives and children of this country in recent years by the habit of borrowing on policies before their maturity, whereas the more one borrows from Latin the more one adds to the original investment. The student of English has ever borrowed from Latin, and where English grammar is neglected in our schools Latin has valiantly assumed that burden. "To the man without Latin," says Professor Stuart P. Sherman, of the English department of the University of Illinois, "our sesquipedalian abstracts remain impene- trably abstract; to a man with Latin they disintegrate into their physical elements. To the one, words like fratricide and matricide, for examples, look strange, learned, and difficult. To the other, who has met frater, mater, and caedere in the Latin lexicon, fratricide looks easy and familiar." Latin pupils have, as it were, a "lexical instinct," a most valuable asset in itself. It is the opinion of Miss Blanchard, teacher of salesmanship in the Dorchester (Massachu- setts) High School, after actual business experience, that it is vocabulary which holds the key of success for the salesman and business man in the fierce competition of the commercial world today. Miss Ripley, the teacher in charge of the department of millinery and dressmaking in the same school, where vocational Latin has been taught so successfully in the commercial courses, after putting Latin into the domestic art course, sums up the case as follows: "The best situations which my girls may reasonably hope to obtain are those of business manager, workroom manager, draper, fitter, or perhaps a combination of two or more of these positions. It has been said that it is only necessary to 'fit' the mind of cus- tomers to achieve success in the sewing trades. Hence a broad, flexible, discriminating vocabulary is a prime business asset. In my opinion, the time is coming to an end when the crude, unedu- cated tradeswoman can succeed."' When the members of the famous Bread Line, or army of the unemployed, were tested in New York City, last winter, as to mental deficiencies, the fact was revealed that the average vocabulary of these poor humans was limited to 200 words or less. That Latin is an aid to spelling goes without proof. However, it is easy to produce the proof should anyone be skeptical enough 1 Classical Journal, X (1914), 8.</page><page sequence="8">408 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL to doubt it. I recently took a few mental measurements, as to spelling and vocabulary, of Latin and non-Latin pupils in our high school. I was careful to select classes of equal grade for comparison, in no way favoring the Latin pupils. I gave the following list of words for spelling: necessity, mediaeval, augment, occurrence, auxili- ary, precedence, million, affability, lateral. For vocabulary I assigned: belligerent, urbane, impecunious, pulchritude, ludicrous, laudatory, deviate, homicidal, sepulchral, mortuary. Of pupils who had had three years of Latin the average for spelling was 90o per cent, io of the 27 scoring ioo each. Of the non-Latin pupils, the average was 6o per cent, none scoring ioo. The average for vocabulary was 76 per cent for the Latin and 38 per cent for the non-Latin pupils. Of pupils who had had two years of Latin the average for spelling was 80 per cent, 4 scoring ioo. Of the non-Latin pupils, the aver- age was 66 per cent, none scoring Ioo. The average for vocabulary was 66 per cent for the Latin, 2 scoring ioo, and 26 per cent for the non-Latin. Of pupils who had had three terms of Latin the average for spelling was 8o per cent, 3 scoring ioo. Of the non-Latin pupils, the average was 57 per cent. The average for vocabulary was 48 per cent for the Latin, I scoring 0oo, and i6 per cent for the non-Latin. The blundering on the part of the Latin pupils in some cases was amusing and provoking but that on the part of the non-Latin was pathetic. For example, one pupil said of homicidal: "A doctor who uses simple home remedies." Another said: "Living in the manner of men." Ludicrous was explained as "speechful," "very clear," and "pertaining to grease." A most interesting contribution to another debt which English owes Latin has been made by Professor Frank J. Miller, of the Uni- versity of Chicago, in a card catalogue of mythological references in a large number of English poets. These sum up as follows: Spenser................ 650 Byron.................. 450 Shelley ................ 325 Robert Browning. ....... 250 J. G.

Mr. Mason D. Gray, of the East High School, Rochester, New York, who believes that a close interdependence should exist in all high-school work, has prepared an excellent list of words to be used for the correlation of Latin with physics, a copy of which I recommend each Latin teacher to present to the physics instructor in her school, with an urgent request that the same be used.' There appeared in the Ithaca Daily News of April 29, 1911, a statement signed by fifty representative professors and instructors in English, German, French, Semitic languages, science, mathe- natics, and engineering in Cornell University which is a striking tribute to the classics. That statement was to the effect that those instructors and professors of practically all the different faculties in the university preferred that students coming to them be prepared in the classics rather than in their own line of work. A similar statement has been made by the faculty in the University of Cincinnati. One of our old-line life-insurance companies, in its last annual report, attempting to express in concrete terms the vast amount paid to policyholders, said the sum, if converted into greenbacks, would make a carpet large enough to cover the city of Savannah, Georgia. "In proportion as we can get the pupils and teachers of other subjects," says Mr. Gray, " to realize and act upon the realiza- tion that Latin is a carpet covering the floor of every other class- room, in that proportion will Latin fight its own battle." I Classical Journal, III (1912), 244.</page><page sequence="10">4Io THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL The rewards of Latin cannot be measured in cold dollars and cents. The schoolboy who has stumbled painfully through his second-year Latin finds the day he "overcame the Nervii" or "crossed the famous bridge" brimming with something precious, that pays him richly for the hours spent among the verbal saepes or floundering in mental paludes worse than any Caesar ever encountered. It was a Latinless high-school Freshman who went to a city library on this errand: "Teacher told me to write an essay tomorrow on 'What I saw on the way to school,' and I want a book on the subject." It was a Junior, likewise innocent of the "impractical Latin," who went to the same library: "We are reading a stupid poem," said he, "called 'Idylls of the King,' and I want to know if you have got the crazy thing in prose so that I can understand it." Indeed, more than one child is robbed of all the poetry of life by being deprived of the humanities. Grant that it may take longer to send the boy to the market- place by way of Rome, but forget not that he will get infinitely more on the way. He will get strains of music for the hour of drudgery, with a beautiful morning picture or a sunset glory thrown in as he passes to and from his daily routine of business. And when, as a man, he has reached the acme of his desires, when he has made his pile and wants to enjoy it, "then," says Mr. James Loeb, New York financier, "comes the time for making the real and only Balance Sheet. Then he must ask himself, 'What are my resources now that I have gained everything that money can buy ? What are my spiritual and intellectual assets? How can I spend what is left to me of life ?' Lucky is the man whose early training has fitted him for something more than the gaming table when his days of business activity are over. He can taste the gentler pleasures that await him in his study and by the blazing hearth-fire. His Sophocles and his Homer or his Catullus will make the winter of life seem like its early spring, when the greatest struggle he knew was with the elusive rules of grammar and syntax. This busy world of ours cannot stop; it will always whirl and rush and hustle. But some of us-and the more the better-must learn that on one side of the rushing stream of life lie the peaceful backwaters, in which the clouds and the sun, the shrubs and the birds of the air</page><page sequence="11">LATIN: A LIVE FACTOR IN MENTAL INSURANCE 411 appear reflected in their true, undistorted image, gently floating on the limpid pool of reverie."' And who, after all, have more time to enjoy these peaceful back- waters than our great industrial masses who own and control about all the useful leisure in the world ? The minister has no leisure; the lawyer has no leisure; the teacher has none; the leaders every- where have no leisure. But the farmer, the artisan, the industrial- ist generally, labors only in the daylight hours. What he does with the balance of his working energies is of the utmost concern. "Here," says Dean Davenport, of the Illinois College of Agricul- ture, "is the great racial asset. If this great mass of men, consti- tuting all but the degenerates, can be properly educated, the racial asset of their leisure moments will in the end be tremendous. It is this mass and what it thinks and does in its leisure hours, either blindly or intelligently, that will ultimately fix the trend of our development and the limits of our achievements, not only in politics and in business, but in literature and art as well." Have you ever considered why so many toilers in shop and fac- tory, under an eight-hour-a-day labor law, can do little else but sleep, eat, or drink during the remaining sixteen hours of every day, while the professional man usually works sixteen hours out of every twenty-four, with apparently no more fatigue ? "The greater part of the fatigue which is developed in our factories and offices," says Mr. Herbert L. Trube, "is due to the fact that in striving to give full attention to the work in hand the individual wastes his much- needed energy in resisting interferences. Primarily, fatigue is due to continued application to an activity without adequate relaxa- tion. Secondarily, it results from the conscious or unconscious effort expended in overcoming distraction.""1 Now every Latin teacher well knows that the study of Latin requires just this sort of effort from the pupil daily and that one who has mastered a high-school course in Latin has learned how to overcome dis- traction.

He added that it was the lack of the power to concentrate that caused most of the inefficiency among his employees. Last week a girl in our high school entered a Cicero class after having dropped Latin the year before. The reason she gave the teacher for resuming the subject was that she knew she could not concentrate and she knew also she never could acquire the habit without Latin. Indeed, our market-place can ill afford to scorn that which our youth can bring from Rome, nor need we fear that the youth who has lived for a while among the heroes of the past will be too much of an anachronism for the present. If the conclusion reached by Dr. Frank Sargent Hoffman in his Psychology and Common Life be true, "that Latin is the most logically constructed of all languages, and will help more effectually than any other study to strengthen the brain centers that must be used when any reasoning is required,"' then would that all our artisans were compelled to enter the lists of the business arena, via Latina. Never has our country been so sadly in need of energizing brains as today. For years we have strenu- ously taught the evils that accrue from the use of alcoholic liquors, and yet, with an increase of 21 per cent in population, we have a corresponding increase of 63 per cent in the consumption of fer- mented liquors. During the three months of July, August, and Sep- tember of the year 1912, we, as a nation, drank 33,150,000 gallons of whiskey, an increase of 450,000 gallons over the same period of the year before. We smoked 3,800,000,000 cigarettes, an increase of ,ooo000,000,ooo. The Popular Mechanics magazine says enough nourishing food is wasted every day to feed every human being in our eighteen largest cities. The railroads of our country lose $300,000,000 annually by petty leakages, due mostly to the ineffi- ciency of the workmen.

Hundreds upon hundreds of girls are studying short- hand and still competent stenographers are so hard to find that some commercial high schools, that of Dorchester, Massachusetts, for instance, have put in commercial Latin, by petition of the faculty. The misspelled name of the new senator from Georgia, in the first edition of the last Congressional Directory, cost our nation thousands of dollars, for the issue had to be immediately recalled, out of senatorial courtesy. Our taxpayers have paid more than one enormous sum to rectify such mistakes in spelling. Have you ever made any personal investigations, I wonder, like Socrates of old, when he sauntered along the thoroughfares of Athens in search of a man who really understood and idealized his business? It is a most interesting anthropomorphic study and readily explains why such a woefully small percentage of our busi- ness men ever win the label of "business success." In my little home town last summer I had occasion to investigate. I went one day to the hardware man. "Why," asked I, "does our new heat- ing apparatus fail to meet your guarantee?" "Oh," said he, "I figured wrong on the radiation; I'll sure have to take that boiler out and put a bigger one in." The thought that my precious vacation time must be spent in overseeing the disseverance of a neatly installed but perfectly useless heating plant brought me to the plumber in no unctuous state of mind. "Why," said I, "does the sewage from the alley run into our cellar ?" "Oh," said he, "the sewer wasn't put down on a level, you know. Slants too much your way. It's got to come up!" To the city engineer next I went. Said I, "Why is our newly laid pavement being torn up ?" Most nonchalantly said he: "Oh," the water just all settled in the middle. Wasn't put down right, so it had to come up." "And our sidewalk! Why is it so much lower than our neighbor's, adjoining ?" "Oh, they didn't give you the right grade." I strolled on to the chimney sweep. "Why," said I, "will not our new chimney draw ?" "I'll see," said he. And what did he see ? Piled high in the base of that chimney all the mortar and loose brick that had fallen during the process of construction, which had carelessly been left there by the stone mason, monumentum aere perennius to his slovenly labor.</page><page sequence="14">414 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL I strolled no more. The thought of the additional taxes I should have to pay for all these blunders took away the charm. Am I a pessimist, thought I, talia flammato mecum corde volutansl What if I am! Better a live pessimist than a dead optimist. I went to my study and pondered over ways and means of stimulat- ing a child to take out mental insurance, for otherwise- How can he work ? He never has been taught The free use of what faculties he had. Why should he work ? Who ever yet has thought To give a love of working to the lad ? Why should he work ? There is no debt behind That man's nobility most longs to pay; No claim upon him-only the one blind, Brute instinct that his dinner lies that way. And that is not enough. Who may not eat Freely at life's full table all his youth, Can never work in power and joy complete, In fulness, and in honor, and in truth. Our problem is to get the child to partake freely of Latin. By so doing we maintain that he will never drop his mental insurance. We also maintain that twenty pages well digested will serve to whet his appetite far better than one hundred pages bolted. There must be the pure milk of declensions and conjugations and the strong meat of translation with the necessary condiments of gerunds, cum clauses, and gerundives. If our pupils really digested and assimi- lated what they are given in the first year's work, nine-tenths of their difficulties in the higher classes would disappear. How then may we strengthen the work of the first year ? Let us start at the very beginning with the assignment of the lesson. One that has a truly Roman ring is the following, given by Mr. Charles E. Dixon, of the Eastern District High School, Brooklyn: "Take to such and such a paragraph from the beginning of the book. You will be expected to know the advance lesson and everything I have ever taught you." Mr. Dixon adds that he reviews, every day, nearly everything, and that "nothing short of perfect accuracy and a high rate of speed is accepted as satisfactory. I tell them that the most important thing is the matter of vocabulary, the next inflection, the</page><page sequence="15">LATIN: A LIVE FACTOR IN MENTAL INSURANCE 415 next syntax, but they must know everything they have studied in the book." A student who shows lack of preparation is kept after school until the deficiency is made good. He is detained the same day that he shows the lack of preparation. Mr. Dixon finds in Brooklyn, as we find in Omaha, an occasional dullard. For such he does not make life a burden, but he does make him do the best he can and repeat the subject the next term. Of those detained after school Mr. Dixon says: "I try to have them have a good time and feel that they are really getting something worth while and not undergoing punishment. When they get this impression they are not loath to come." And finally, "All we teachers have to do is to teach them with spirit, with devotion, with kindness, and, if necessary, with a firmness and energy that compel response on the part of indifferent or shrinking students. Take the subject of con- ditions-the whole subject, exclusive of conditions in indirect dis- course. The whole thing can be made clear in ten minutes by a skilful instructor. If the student forgets, then it must be done over again. Constant, everlasting, and speedy review--review is the secret." This review work should be made as interesting and varied as possible. "It is not the difficulty of the subject," says Professor Julius Sachs, of Columbia University, "that depresses our first-year pupils, but lack of initiative, of inventiveness, in the instructor." Twenty-four pupils should never be allowed to sit idle while the twenty-fifth is struggling with his noun and verb. Put a dozen to work with nouns and verbs at the board. Send the other dozen to beat the record made by the first. Have a contest frequently between the girls and the boys and choose a secretary to keep a record of the winning side and to report the same in Latin, occasionally. Again, give each row of pupils a declension, a synop- sis, or a sentence to write and let the one who first hands in a cor- rect answer grade the papers in that row. It takes but a moment for the teacher to write a long but easy Latin sentence on the board and the pupils delight in vying with one another to see who can translate it first. Often a difficult sentence may be elucidated by means of a diagram. For the first six weeks pupils should "prove" each English sentence before trying to write it in Latin. "To prove" means to write above each noun in the English sentence its</page><page sequence="16">416 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL case and number and to write below the corresponding case and number to be used in Latin. For example: Nom. sing. Poss. sing. Ind. obj. Direct obj. Galba is telling the farmer's daughters a story. Nom. sing. Gen. sing. Dat. pl. Acc. sing. Professor B. O. Foster, of Leland Stanford, in a recent article for the Classical Journal says that of a child's three difficulties -inflection, vocabulary, and word order-the worst is word order. Much writing of easy prose will give a feeling for word order but it can never be helpful if the child is allowed to write with a serene indifference to the Latin order. Well on in the second term pupils might be asked to write a sentence or two about Lincoln or Wash- ington on their respective birthdays. On the famous Ides, Julius Caesar might be the topic assigned. A New Year's resolution, a valentine, the description of a ball game, a note to an absent class- mate, are prose potentialities. Of course, they can never take the place of the regular, prepared, corrected, and recorrected exercises. When teaching vocabulary we should try to insist upon the association of the Latin words directly with the thing or activity for which they stand, and not their association with the English equivalent. The word equus should present to the child's mind, not the letters h-o-r-s-e, but the concept of a real, live equus. Interest may be stimulated in vocabulary if the child is taught that words, like the faces of familiar friends, have been changed, marred, and even scarred by the process of time. Even a Freshman can appre- ciate the meaning of villian, for instance, when he is told that the word originally meant a servant in a villa, and later came to mean a person of low or base condition. A Freshman, too, can see the scar that English words like miser and egregious have received, and perhaps he can appreciate the fact that negotium means "not rest." We must remember that in our beginning Latin classes we are giving many pupils their first taste of real, hard study. It takes patience and ingenuity to keep them interested and disposed to stick to their task. We must stay close to them individually, especially the first six weeks. If they are disquieted because others give glowing reports of high marks in less irksome subjects, we must</page><page sequence="17">LATIN: A LIVE FACTOR IN MENTAL INSURANCE 417 urge them not to risk the loss of their mental insurance in order to gratify temporal pleasures. Should they bring a doctor's state- ment or parental note to the effect that the study of Latin may cause a nervous breakdown, refer them to the article in the Literary Digest, for April ii, I914, in which Dr. E. Lindon Mellus declares the average brain has 6,000,ooo,ooo cells, and if only one-third of a million were put in action daily for fifty years there would be no danger of brain strain. However, we should try to encourage all such pupils, remembering that it is not work which causes over- fatigue so much as the lack of conscious progress. In truth, the first-year-Latin teacher cannot be a drone. She must even drudge a little, if her work is to be crowned with success. "By what is that success determined?" one may ask. "If the pupil in Caesar cannot tell at sight the gender and case of a regular noun, the mode and tense of a regular verb, then your first-year- Latin work has been a failure" is the verdict of the late Professor H. W. Johnston. And if, occasionally, the first-year work has been a failure, what must the Caesar teacher do in order that these pupils may not become discouraged and drop their mental insurance ? Here is an excellent opportunity for you to display your ingenuity as a good mental-insurance agent. Some helpful hints by Miss Pound appeared in the May number of the Classical Journal. Lack of time does not permit me to go into detail as to plans, but one device which I have used quite successfully I term "mental photography." If a pupil gives me a carelessly written prose exercise or a depress- ingly bad test paper, I designate the mistakes in blue pencil or red ink and label it "Photograph of John Jones's brain, taken Novem- ber fifth," or whatever the date may be. Occasionally I send these brain photographs to the parents. Such criticism, however, must always be given in the true spirit of helpfulness and never with the idea of ridicule. And finally, our aim should be to show these pupils their own individual need for mental insurance and how Latin meets this need; and then, remembering that human inertia is great, we should urge them to keep up their payments on their Latin policy. If we can do this, we are accomplishing a great work, for Emerson says the greatest need a man has is for someone to make him do that which he ought to do.</page></plain_text>
