While an object may become autonomous to the point of acquiring the status of a quasi person, collectors tend to lose their autonomy to the point of viewing (or imagining) themselves as pieces in a collection. This imaginary blurring of identities shapes the conceptualization of the relation construed as an ex change in which what each receives is proportional to what each has given. As shown by examples borrowed from literature and ethnology, the fusion between persons and things is not specific to primitive art collectors, but is also apparent in other forms of passionate involvement.

(Jean-Paul Sartre 2000: 590) The blurred distinction between subjects and objects, humans and animals, or person and cosmos has be come a familiar and widespread notion through eth nographic studies of traditional non-Western societ ies. In certain cultures of Oceania, it is not enough for an individual to be born a human in order to be a human; neither is it enough merely to die in order to become an ancestor. Such distinctions common ly involve rites and rituals. For people, the nature of what is seen is never definite or certain - a stone, an animal, or a tree may, for instance, be the decep tive temporary figure of a spirit or sorcerer. In cer emonies involving ritual objects, an object is never simply an object, but is viewed rather as a presence in its own right - the presence of a supernatural be ing or of a dead person or as the counterpart of a living person. In Western societies, the Christian tradition has generated analogous representations embodied by various artefacts and interpreted as the "presentifi cation" of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, or saints. Material examples of such artefacts include statues that bleed, move, and speak, and other miraculous images. The historian David Freedberg, author of a book-length study on the subject, has observed: We may be quite happy to believe that images in primitive cultures are felt to partake of the life of what they repre sent, or even of the life of something altogether different from what they represent. But we do not like to think this of ourselves, or of our own society. We refuse (or at least we have refused for decades) to acknowledge the traces of animism in our perception of and response to images;</page><page sequence="2">530 Brigitte Derlon and Monique Jeudy-Ballini not necessarily animism in the ethnographic sense of the term, which in the nineteenth century implied the transfer of a spirit to an inanimate object, but rather in the sense of the degree of life or vitality that is imagined to be inherent to the image (1998: 47). It is now widely accepted that religion is the privileged domain of expression of the blurring of boundaries between beings and things. Yet this ten dency is not only apparent in the religious sphere. Much the same phenomenon was highlighted in our ethnographic investigations conducted on the attitudes of primitive art collectors located (for the most part) in the Paris region (Derlon et Jeudy-Bal lini 2008).1 The way in which collectors speak of their passion suggests that their intimate relation ship with objects may exemplify a similar kind of definitional instability in the secular realm. Before pursuing this line of thought, some re marks about the broader context of this research are in order. In the 1980s, US-based scholars working in a wide range of fields (history, ethnology, com parative literature, art criticism) and claiming alle giance to postmodernism and postcolonialism be gan to adopt a critical approach to art collections and the Western relation to the material cultures of formerly colonized peoples. Strong criticisms were levelled against the destruction of indigenous cul tures as a result of the collection of native artefacts and against the primitivist stereotypes subtending their reinterpretation. Primitive art collectors, often discredited for their "received ideas" (Price 1989), were targeted as emblematic figures of the arrogant neocolonial tendency of the West to appropriate the world and to "shape non-Western arts in its own image" (Clifford 1988). For many years, the sheer force of this condemnation has impeded attempts to adopt an ethnographic approach to primitive art col lectors. Though it acknowledges the contributions of postmodernism and postcolonialism, this study is premised on the assumption that the time has now come to go beyond a purely critical perspective and to adopt a position of axiological neutrality in an attempt to reconsider the viewpoint of primitive art collectors. The purpose of this study is to examine how collectors intellectually reappropriate primi tive art pieces, how they invest them with their own imaginary frameworks, and how they experience their intimate relation with them. Our study will focus on one of the recurrent themes noted in the accounts given by interviewees: the assimilation of objects to animate beings. Such an assimilation, echoed in Alfred Gell 's theory of art as a "social agent" ( 1998), already has been point ed out in a number of studies on private collecting. Susan M. Pearce, a professor of museum studies, reported about a doll collector treating "the dolls like real children, giving them names and talking to them" (1995: 188). In his essay on the consumer society, Russell W. Belk wrote that among the au tomobile collectors "their much loved automobiles are often given names such as 'My Cherree,' 'Can dy,' and 'Shot Through the Heart,' or referred to as 'my baby' and 'my child'" (2001: 75). For Belk, "naming collected objects ... is a way of further individualizing, singularizing, and decommoditiz ing them. ... When we anthropomorphize collected objects we animate our regard for these objects so that a person-thing relationship becomes a person person relationship" (2001: 75 f.). Our conviction is that this kind of phenomena deserves fully ethno graphical attention. Yet, to our knowledge, no other anthropological investigation had been conducted on this aspect of collecting. Let us mention that still today no comparable study has been published. One collector interviewed during our research insisted that for him, "these objects are very much alive. I don't collect things just for the sake of own ing objects", while another collector noted: "In fact I live with objects. For me, they're like human be ings." Yet another interviewee echoed similar views in complaining that he always missed pieces lent for an exhibition just "as if they were a human being." Most of the collectors interviewed tend to describe their practice as an activity that involves a relation with beings rather than objects. The act of collecting is thus less a matter of accumulating objects than of surrounding oneself with "presences" - to cite one account that may partly explain the reluctance of many collectors to view themselves as "collec tors." Interviewees often use terms drawn from the 1 Interviewees included approximately fifty men and women ranging in age from 30 to 75 and drawn from highly differen tiated social origins and circumstances. Interviewees owned collections that varied significantly in terms of geographical origin (Africa, Americas, Asia, Oceania), size (ranging from a dozen items to over a thousand), financial value (from a few hundred euros to nearly a million euros in the case of one particular item), and the main sites used to source and purchase items (purchased in the country of origin, auction rooms, flea markets, galleries, exchanges, or through inheri tance, etc.). No significant differences that could be explained by gender were highlighted in interviews conducted since 2000. However, no general conclusions can be drawn from this observation, given the limited number of female collec tors interviewed in the course of this research. When several quotations from interviews are given consecutively, quota tions from different interviewees are given on different lines.

Whether it be an African dancer, revering a mask crafted by his own hands and viewed as a dangerous spirit, a Christian worshipper interpreting a wafer as if it were the body of Christ, or a scholar hurling abuse at a failing computer accused of ill will, the point is not to assume that collectors are unable to draw a distinction between beings and things. Rath er it is to account for what collectors view as the most eloquent means of expressing their passionate relationship with some objects rather than others. Because primitive art lovers are seldom loners and since their activities routinely involve travel and so cial gatherings in a wide range of settings (galleries, auction rooms, flea markets, museums, specialist bookshops, invitations from fellow collectors, etc.), collectors may be said to share a common knowl edge, language, and imaginative universe transmit ted from generation to generation. In the same way that a sociologist, seeking to understand the social conditions of access to "the love of art," may persevere at the risk of being sus pected of "challenging the authenticity and sincer ity of aesthetic pleasure by the mere fact of describ ing its conditions of existence" (Bourdieu et Darbel 1969: 161), so ethnologists should not be deterred from pursuing their interest in the imaginative uni verse of art lovers - however, much of their interest might warrant the accusation that they tend to dis regard the sociological mechanisms involved in its reproduction. To those who might presume that the only justification of the discourse of passion is to conceal unavowed or shameful economic motives, it is perhaps worth recalling that the existence of such motives is entirely compatible with the capacity to feel and communicate passion, notwithstanding the claims of a long tradition of thought that has tend ed to oppose the economic sphere and the realm of affects,2 a tradition vehemently criticized by the so ciologist Viviana A. Zelizer (2005). Of the Object as Subject Collectors are prone to view objects as autonomous agents, a tendency often manifested at the very first encounter with an art object. Far from being chosen by the collector, the object often imposes itself on the collector as if it had chosen them. As noted by the collector Jean Paul Barbier-Mueller (2001: 10): "One might easily be forgiven for thinking, not that Hubert Goldet [a famous French collector] had bought these statuettes and masks, but that they had recognised and chosen their master, and had fervently offered themselves to him." By virtue of its "force," its "terrible presence," its "life," its "soul," its "vibrations," its "emanations," its "expressive ness," its capacity to "emanate," its "magnetic pow er," its "magic," or "spellbinding charm," the object forces the collector to acknowledge its distinctive ness. Whether the object is glimpsed in the window of a gallery, on a stand in a flea market or in the hands of an auctioneer or of a Melanesian villag er, collectors are invariably drawn to the object that "strikes us most," that "winks at us," and that "calls out" to its future owner. As Cousin Pons said it in Balzac's novel (1999: 86): "I believe in the intel ligence of art objects; they know art lovers; they call out to them; they say: Psst! Psst!" Rather than eliciting a judgment of taste, the object subjects the owner to its effectiveness, forcing the owner to ex perience emotionally that, which makes the object conspicuously unique and uniquely desirable. Unlike ordinary things, the art object owes its au tonomy to the fact that it is never truly owned and possessed. The person who owns an object (at most for the duration of a lifetime) will often experience a sense of acting merely as a link in the life of the object. The object will continue to exist long after the owner has died, just as it existed before them. In short, the object is destined to a lifetime of collect ing collectors. Ownership is thus not experienced as a complete appropriation: purchasing an object is nothing more than a form of rental - i.e., pay ment for the right to enjoy the object for the dura tion of a lifetime: I've got something from the fourth dynasty down the cor ridor. How much did I pay for it? I've had it for ten years. I've still got ... what ... fifteen years to live? I paid for the right to five in its company for twenty-five years, and after that? It dates from the 4th century b.c., so I suppose it'll carry on quite happily without me! I know that I won't be taking them with me to the grave. I just consider myself lucky to be able to live with them for a while.3 2 Primitive art collectors often view themselves as part of this tradition, as shown by analyses of the relation to money ex pressed in accounts given by collectors. 3 "Works of art are permanent (or nearly so!): collectors come and go", as Frank Herrmann (1972: 22) observed, as quoted by Russell Belk, who also remarked that "[c]ollectors are stewards of treasures that are only temporarily theirs" (2001: 73). "Owners come and go, while objects remain ..." ob serves Rolande Bonnain-Dulon (2001: 252). In a similar vein, Jean Paul Barbier-Mueller has noted that "[a]rt works are the only things that truly matter; art works remain and see collectors come and go" (2003: 16). Anthropos 107.2012</page><page sequence="4">532 Brigitte Derlon and Monique Jeudy-Ballini The autonomy of the object also means that full intellectual ownership (and not only material own ership) is forever impossible. For primitive art lov ers, primitive art retains an irreducible element of mystery, and might, therefore, be said to owe part of its appeal and power to its partial incomprehensibil ity - i.e., its capacity to resist complete understand ing. By a kind of enigmatic asymmetry, the object exerting an emotional impact on the subject remains impenetrable, impregnable, and impervious to com plete cognitive appropriation. The subject contem plating the object is alfected by the power of the object, which resists all attempts by the subject to rationally "circumscribe" it. Collectors also tend to imbue objects with a unique and distinctive temperament, a "personali ty" replete with positive and negative traits in equal measure. Sometimes likened to a "companion," a "friend," or "confidant," the object is deemed to have a sense of "humor," "depth," "benevolence," "generosity," and other highly valued "human feel ings." Such representations can apply to any item irrespective of its degree of anthropomorphism or whether it is associated with death, war, or witch craft. An object may also be viewed as being en dowed with its own affects as a result of its original autochthonous use. One interviewee, instead of say ing that a club was used to kill, said that the item it self "had killed." Another interviewee imputed "evil ideas," "envies," and "petty tricks" to a "sorcerer's statuette." In short, objects are often imputed with the presumed actions and intentions of their origi nal users. However, based on the evidence provided by col lectors, it is not merely that an object has affects. It may also have "rights" (for example the right to "deserve" its place in a collection) and even morals, inasmuch as its owner may pass judgement on the honesty of the object - just as we might pass judge ment on a person. In speaking of the questionable authenticity of an object, one collector observed: "If it tells me it loves me, I know it's not lying." In this instance, the moral dimension has to do with the sincerity of the feelings (i.e., love) expressed by the object toward its owner. Conversely, since it is deemed to be guilty of disloyalty, a forgery jeopar dizes the future of the relationship. If most of the interviewees stated that they could never conceive of keeping any item of questionable authenticity, it was precisely because of the "relations of trust" de veloped with every item in a collection (as one in terviewee put it). Those who mistake a forgery as being authentic tend to feel cheated or abused by the object - in some sense victims of its petty schemes and dishonesty. The object seduced me and to that extent it deceived me. I stopped loving the object as soon as I realized I'd been betrayed. I deceived myself and, at the same time, the ob ject deceived me. [When I found out that one of my objects was a fake] I felt scorned. Yet the object-person analogy4 extends beyond the ascription of a specific personality to items in a collection, since it also involves the realm of the tangible or perceptible, as suggested by the tenden cy of collectors to describe their contact with ob jects in highly tactile, physical, or bodily terms. One male collector claimed to be particularly fond of small items because of their "sensuality," compar ing the pleasure experienced in handling objects for long periods of time to the sensual pleasure experi enced in caressing a "woman's shoulder." Accord ing to another collector, who handled clubs with a form of "maternal care," reminiscent of the care ap plied by cousin Pons in handling precious objects (Balzac 1999: 51), the sensation produced by physi cal contact has nothing to do with an expression of virility or physical violence: "It's very sensual ... It's affectionate ... A baby's bottom is just as soft. My son has the same consistency ... You know that firmness, when you touch the cheeks, the arms, the bottom, the thighs ... He has the same ... How can I put it? You get the same sensation from it as when you handle a beautiful club or a very beautiful pestle or a very beautiful jade axe blade." After comparing the object with the body of his son, the interviewee proceeded to invert the comparison, observing that physical contact with his son evoked the tactile soft ness of the object - so that it became unclear wheth er it was the weapon that reminded him of his child or vice versa. The emphasis on the sensuality of the body of a woman or baby suggests that collectors primarily invoke parental and/or love relationships in describ ing their singular relationship with objects. The Parental Analogy The rapprochement between the club and the baby (two seemingly antithetical entities) needs to be seen in connection with similar comments that form a dense and highly meaningful network of associa 4 Nathalie Heinich (2002) has focused on what she terms ob ject-people. However, the general categories used by Heinich, operating as a sociologist, are based on notions (fetish, relic) which, in view of their largely metaphorical usage, are of lit tle use in a strictly ethnographic research context.

He is amongst his own in a high forest of kindly spirits over whom he casts a brotherly eye. They are the companions of a life time" (2003: 19). In reading Amrouche, it is difficult to decide just what is involved: a personification of objects likened to the members of a brotherhood or a reification of the collector as a person that has be come a piece among others within a large family of objects - in short, an item in his collection. The confusion of categories is sometimes per ceived as a potential identity confusion - for in stance, when a collector has the impression of be ing just an intruder among his own objects: "There comes a moment when ... I have this feeling, after having bought a number of African pieces ... All of a sudden, I find myself surrounded by thirty statues and I say to myself 'who's that white guy over there [laughs]?'." The Love Connection Even more so than the blood or family relationship it is the love relationship that collectors tend to use as their preferred metaphor for expressing their pas sion for art objects.5 While the legendary figure of Pygmalion, the sculptor in love with his ivory stat ue, is evidence of the long-standing literary tradi tion of our love relationship with objects, evidence of a similar tendency in more unexpected quarters (for instance, in the Christian writings of the eighth century devoted to holy images) is perhaps indica tive of its broader importance in Western culture. The author of an addition to a letter sent by Pope Gregory to a hermit, who had made a request for pious paintings, compared "the desire of the her mit to see and possess these images to the desire of the lover hastening to precede their loved one on the way to the baths in order to catch a passing glimpse of them and return happy" (Schmitt 2002: 104f.). In the realm of art collections, later exam ples of the same theme are found in Romanticism. In "Le cousin Pons," Balzac describes one charac ter who had caught a glimpse of a rival's collec tion as experiencing "the same happiness as a lover of women sneaking into the boudoir of a beautiful mistress concealed by a friend" (1999: 194). Mau passant provides one of the most suggestive illustra tions of this tendency: You contemplate an object and little by little it seduces you, troubles you, and takes hold of you as might the face of a woman. Its charm enters into you as might an alien charm ... and you love it, desire it, want it. An over whelming need to possess it takes hold of you - first as a gentle need, a shy need, but then it grows, becoming vio lent and irresistible. Oh! I pity anyone who has never experienced the hon eymoon of the collector with a trinket they have recently purchased. You caress it with your eyes and hands as if it were made of flesh and blood. You return to its side at all times. You think about it all the time, wherever you go, whatever you do. The fond memory of the object follows you down the street, out into the world, everywhere you go; and when you go home, before you've even removed your hat and gloves, you contemplate it with all the ten derness and affection of a lover. (2000: 141). Among the (mainly male) collectors interviewed in this research, the analogy drawn between the ob ject and the loved one was sometimes expressed so indirectly that interviewees appeared to be largely unaware of the comparison. For instance: There was this sale in 1979. I'll never forget it. It was the first piece I'd ever bought, the first important piece I ever bought - at some cost - in a public sale. I was euphoric, absolutely euphoric ! I was with my brother-in-law and my wife. We went for a drink in a place I liked, on the Place de la Contrescarpe, which I liked because I experienced my first passion not far from the Place de la Contrescarpe. The first object acquired is thus likened to the first woman ever loved - events experienced as first loves and both associated with the same place and the same unforgettable sense of elation. Whether conscious or unconscious, the analogy is often ex tended to include all aspects and stages of a love life, a tendency exhibited in various ways by many of the collectors interviewed in this research: - Orgasm If you weren't women, I'd say it's like an ejaculation. But that's exactly what it is. I think purchasing objects is an imaginary act of love. - Narcissism We have the objects we deserve. We have the collection we deserve. We sleep with the women we deserve. It's the same thing! Absolutely! - Emotional dependence It's a need, you're in love, you want to see the woman you 5 See Rheims (2002); Baudrillard (1968); Muensterberger (1996). - While many scholars have drawn a parallel between the activity of collection and "Don Juanism," it is important to note, that the love metaphor is not only found in contexts where possession is the issue at stake - the aesthetic relation may also involve a similar process. The philosopher Mikel Dufrenne (1992b: 532) notes: "Between aesthetic admiration and love, there are significant common traits - first and fore most the acknowledgement of the power of the other and the recognition of their rights: I am as disarmed before an aes thetic object, about which 1 have everything to learn and re ceive, as I am before a loved one."

It was Max Itzikovitz [a collector] who, seeing me purchasing a lobi sculpture, drew my attention to its close physical resem blance to me. One of my friends, the owner of a kusu statue, was perhaps not aware that the physiognomy of this work, of which he is rightly proud, bears an uncanny resemblance to him - at least straight on (Chazal 2000). Photographers are particularly adept at using presumed physical similarities in crafting portraits of collectors standing near one of their items. Play ing directly with the imagined assimilation with the object more than the idea of resemblance, Jacques Kerchache once posed crouched down on a pedestal in the window of the Pavillon des Sessions (Louvre Museum). Posing as an effigy with his hands over his ears, a wide-eyed Kerchache was made to be come an object in the lens of the photographer (see photograph in Bethenod 2003: 196). Another form of identification involves the as similation of an object with a fantastical feature of the owner, an almost physical, even prosthetic, feature. According to the collector Liliane Durand Dessert, the love given to an object is a way of "res onating with the object so that it becomes an aspect or extension of our body or consciousness" (Espe nel 2003: 52). The fact of rediscovering items to which he had provisionally granted less attention caused one interviewee to say that we "forget ob jects just as we forget parts of ourselves that sud denly re-emerge." Discussing overmodeled skulls from Oceania, Jean Benoît observed that "[t]hese objects are dear to me and live in my eye-sockets" (Degli 1997: 9). Benoît, an artist in the surrealist movement, admitted to a pronounced fascination for relics presented as visually perceived objects in situ and as organs of human visual perception, as if ob jects were to contemplate themselves. The boundar ies between person and object thus become blurred, and a colonization of the former by the latter is set in motion: the subject is reified by becoming what s/he contemplates. Construed as the expression of an intimate and passionate relationship with the object, the imag ined incorporation of the object may sometimes be likened to a form of psychological compensation: "Of course you have guys who sleep with their club. They sleep with a sex they don't have. Quite simply! That's it!" Reassurance may involve a sense of pro tection, as suggested by the painter Henri Cueco, the "collector of collections"6: "Perhaps it is the case that all the works around me are of the same nature as me - they extend me, inflate me, 'protuberate' me to protect me and perpetuate me. ... I don't like to give. I am not particularly stingy but I don't like to spread myself too thin, to divide myself' (1995: 103 f.). The "obesity" (Cueco 1995: 103) of the col lector, swelling because of his objects, may perhaps be seen as conferring an excess of identity upon the collector - not unlike the assumed effects of prac tices enabling a natural or artificial growth in physi cal size in many cultures.7 The strength of the bond created by a strong sense of identification can be such that separation from an object is experienced as a form of mutila tion ("Every now and then, I would give an item away, but it always tore me apart") or as the sign of an intimate transformation of the subject. As noted by one interviewee: "We're all full of things we nev er throw away, because we can't throw them away, because they're the very basis of our personhood. In the midst of a crisis, we tend to throw things away because we're changing. Something we don't dis card is something we just cannot cast away." For this particular interviewee, objects form a kind of structure within his internal architecture. In speak ing of a deceased fellow collector, another collec tor observed: "The day his objects were taken away, he died, he let himself die." Another collector de scribed the woman who shared his passion as being "nourished by objects" - thereby likening objects to a vital energetic substance. Such a representation of the incorporation of the object by the person un derlines the intense and close relationship deemed to connect them beyond death. Making One "It is inexhaustible. But it is I who become inexhaust ible," observed one collector in speaking of the ir reducible mystery of an object. "The more I under stand, the more I grow with the object. Sometimes I want to embrace it and merge with it, and to keep it as an archaeological reminder of myself. ... I feel as if I am a dying world. We are faces that disap pear and I am a world that is dying." In this instance, Rather than collecting primitive art, Henri Cueco collects the most disparate series of discarded items and functional or worthless objects: strings, used shoes, used pencils, stones, pits, sponges, postcards, etc. Consider the virtues attributed to prolonged physical immo bility during certain Melanesian initiation rites, or the pres tige earned by Polynesian noblemen as a result of enveloping themselves in barkcloth several hundred meters long.

So long as it has yet to occur, everything is geared toward achieving fusion. This tendency was exhibited in interviews in the form of a recurrent belief in the predestined nature of the encounter be tween the collector and the object, in some sense promised to one another or destined to find one other. Even when fusion ends and collector and object are dissociated, something endures that makes it impos sible to conceive of the separation as complete: I'm going to say something that may sound very silly, something that has no basis in reality, and which is prob ably completely untrue, but is probably real nevertheless: even when an object goes somewhere else, a subtle connec tion remains between the object and yourself. The fact that you will probably never see it again is of no importance. It is precisely by invoking a kind of soul mate bond between object and collector that another in terviewee explained his frequent encounters with pieces, which he had previously owned and are ex hibited in galleries, as his destiny constantly to want to bring them together. Is it not the case that the no tion of pedigree is founded on the postulate of a lasting connection between an object and its various Western owners beyond their separation? The last ing connection represents a memorializing, mysti cal, or even organic relation for those who believe that renowned collectors, before them have left a physical trace of themselves in the patina of the ob ject, that "humanism turned to matter," as the col lector George Ortiz once put it (de Roux et Parin gaux 1999: 327). Exchange and Reciprocity When collectors evoke extreme situations in which the intensity of their passion "inhabits the entire self" (Veyne 1996: 261),8 the object becomes au tonomous to the point of acquiring the status of a quasi person. The owner loses his/her autonomy to the point of believing or imagining him-/herself to be a piece in a collection. The imagined parity be tween subject and object is linked to a conception of the relation as a form of exchange. These may in volve exchanges in the form of a dialogue: The first thing I saw: it speaks to me! There are objects I won't ever sell because I communi cate with them. Everybody's waiting for my African jewellery. They're all lying in wait for my jewellery, they're crazy, they phone me, they want them. But the thing is, I can't sell them. First of all, I love them too much, they're just too beautiful. And besides ... my items still have a lot of things to tell me! I have many conversations with it. Turn it around, you'll see. It talks to me all the time. That's a masterpiece in it self! They may also involve exchanges in the form of the repeated gifts made by objects to those living in their company: Every morning, I get up, I check up on them, and every night [ check up on them as well. Why? Because they give me strength ! It helps me to switch olf. When I put an object next to me on the table, like that, I'm able to write for an hour, maybe two. With the object next to me, I feel enriched. Every time I've gone on a crazy shopping spree [purchas ing new pieces], it's always been art objects that have giv en me the most comfort, the most satisfaction ... Once I've given myself a little fright... Some collectors justified their decision to part with some pieces of their collection on the grounds that they no longer got anything out of them. One particularly disenchanted collector stated: These objects taught me things for years and years ... And then all of a sudden, I realized they had nothing more to give save aesthetic satisfaction. ... There was no longer any communication between us. I'd taken everything, or perhaps it was just that they'd given me everything they had to give. Collectors tend to construe the gifts they receive from their objects as fair compensation by view ing them in the context of reciprocal exchanges in which what each partner receives is a reflection of what they give. As one interviewee confided: "I be come the fetishist of fetishes"; "I think they have something to give me and that I, perhaps, have something to give them." The interviewee was un able to explain what the objects gave him or what he gave them, but could not imagine that anything but a reciprocal relation could exist between them. Some interviewees clearly suggested that what they gave to objects was nothing less than life itself. Since a collection represents an organic whole, it needs something more than mere beauty or authenticity. It needs the living presence of which objects are in herently deprived and which is instilled in them by their owner. Was it not the passion of Pygmalion for his statue, that incited Venus to turn the statue into a body of flesh and blood? 8 These are situations in which (as Paul Veyne notes) "the mu sic lover might be seen as becoming the music or spectators and even football players might be seen as becoming the match itself' (1996: 261).

Experienced as an af front, as an attack on one's identity, the effects are not unlike the indifference vehemently denounced by one collector: Interviewee: "There are people I hate. Yes, really! Peo ple I really hate - and I could give you some really fa mous names - people who've come to dinner, people who didn't look at a single object, or make a single remark throughout the entire evening. They could've been sit ting in a Louis XV salon - it would've made no differ ence whatsoever. Oh really! Like this guy, not very long ago, a really famous person that's well-known in the art world ... These objects really leap up at you, particularly when there are so many of them and in such a shambles! They're such powerful objects! Now that I really can't stand! I hate the guy." Authors: "Is it envy, scorn?" Interviewee: "No, it isn't. It's just stupidity and preten tiousness! By contrast, three years ago I invited a grand old Russian lady for dinner. She's since passed away. It was the first time she'd come to my house. She walked in and immediately said: 'Oh my goodness, it's so hor rible here!' I loved her straight away. All throughout the evening, she kept telling me how horrible the place was. Now that I like! But indifference! That someone should fail to react! At least say it's ugly or beautiful. ... I was staggered, distraught!" Authors: "So you admit, your pieces may not neces sarily be to everyone's taste?" Interviewee: "Yes, I do. Yes, absolutely! But I like to have a chat about it. What I can't understand is indifference." While the detestation felt toward his objects by a third party was construed by the collector as a flat tering recognition of his uniqueness, indifference (i.e,. the eye that fails to see and acts as if objects did not exist) denies him the intense pleasure of "being looked at through his collection" (Wajcman 1999: 39). In return, the insensitive visitor will be met not with disdain, but with a far stronger feeling: hatred. The collector's propensity to become an object un der the gaze of others in lieu of his objects, to confer upon himself the emotions or judgements elicited by his collection, was also in evidence in cases where judgements were positive, as illustrated by one man in speaking of his wife: "She derives a real pleasure from living with objects, from understanding them, from seeing them. I've had a thousand signs of this, signs of love." To love objects is to love oneself, and even more so, to keep showing such love. Passion as an Experience of Fusion The tendency to assign uniqueness to the objects that inhabit our daily surroundings - a uniqueness as similating objects to quasi people - is also common in other spheres. Jean Bazin and Alban Bensa ob serve that even a tool cannot be reduced to its prac tical function and that "relations of complicity and intimacy" may be forged with it that turn it into an "alter-ego.... Following Mauss, we need to take the uniqueness and 'soul' of things seriously" (1994: 6). Among lovers of primitive art, the phenomenon is otherwise more complex since (in its most fan tastical expression) the fusion-like relation of the collector with his/her object can be viewed as a per sonification of the object and as a reification of the self. What appears to be at work is a process of iden tification founded on the abolition of generic dis tinctions, sometimes expressed through a sense of encompassing the object or of being encompassed by the object. This kind of process, which tends to make each entity a foreigner to itself and akin to the other, may remind us of what the philosopher Mikel Dufrenne (1992) has written about aesthetic experi ence conceived as "alienation": Just as perception cannot be explained merely by depict ing an object and a subject that are external to one an other ... , so the presence of a subject witnessing a work cannot be reduced to their mere physical presence. They must enter the intimacy of the work. Music provides a good example of this: at a concert, I am sitting opposite an orchestra, but I am also in the symphony; you might also say that the symphony is in me to describe this sense of reciprocal possession (Dufrenne 1992a: 96). ... I must accept to give way to enchantment: to renounce my tendency to want to control the object and to conjure away the physical or tangible in order to merge with it. I will then be in a position to see that the object has an in ner life and that I share an affinity with it. It is what I am directing my attention toward, but I am directed toward it as if it were consubstantial with me by entering into it or by allowing it to enter me. ... I become the melody or the statue, and yet the melody and the statue remain exter nal to me. I become them in order that they may become themselves (Dufrenne 1992a: 286). The process of bridging or crossing the divide be tween beings and things - a process that inevitably reminds us of the experience of mystical union9 - is not an exclusive feature of the aesthetic relation. We 9 As stated by Thérèse d'Avila: "I was suddenly overcome by a strong sense of the presence of God. At that point I had no doubt whatsoever that God was within me and that I had be come part of Him" (1964: 65). Anthropos 107.2012</page><page sequence="14">542 Brigitte Derlon and Monique Jeudy-Ballini might argue that all forms of affective or passionate involvement are liable to involve a similar imaginary dimension, independently of the activity considered and of its suitability for anthropomorphization. "I am extremely fond of botany. All I have left in my head is straw and one day I'm going to wake up only to realize I've turned into a plant," wrote Jean Jacques Rousseau (Drouin 2004: 96). Still in the realm of horticulture, the ethnologist Martine Ber gues underlined "the friendly relation that develops between women and plants" (endowed with temper ament, patience, kindness, generosity), highlight ing "the fragility of the distinction between genera, plant, and human" (2004: 70-73). The same idea applies equally to animal and human genera - as shown by the case of a butterfly lover who experi enced a sense of becoming a butterfly by contem plating a mirror image of her skin, "so pale, almost bluish, transparent.... She is persuaded that she be longs to the insect world and that she has not yet reached the caterpillar stage. She waits impatiently for the day when she will come out of her cocoon, spread out her wings, and fly off to join her fellow butterflies" (Waldmann-Tozo 2005: 22). In the realm of literary creation, the narrator of "Du côté de chez Swann" considered any "new book not as a thing with many fellow creatures, but as a unique person, with no other reason to exist ex cept as and for itself' (Proust, see Descombes 1987: 123). Amos Oz, "at the age when children learn to read, decreed that he did not wish to write books, but to become a book himself' (Rérolle 2004: 1). The fantasy of the instability of the boundaries between people and things is also apparent in the industrial world, a realm often (mistakenly) viewed as being dominated by rationality and less prone to affective investment. Philippe Erikson emphasizes the intense relation between the foundry workers of a steel company and the steel they mould and shape. The correspondence posited between the respective qualities of man and steel (credited as having sensa tions and a will of its own) is such that "people [are] all the more 'metalizable' as metal itself [is] metab olizable, thus acquiring the status of a quasi animate being" (1997: 120-123). In professional jargon, the frequent use of metaphors drawn from the food, cu linary and digestive fields suggests the existence of an imaginary dimension articulated around the in corporation of steel (Erikson 1997: 127 f.). The fas cination of the foundry workers with steel casting also sustains a particular fantasy - the fantasy of throwing themselves into the tank to blend with the substance or the testamentary request "to be inciner ated, after death, in the furnace of the steel factory" (Erikson 1997: 128 f.). These accounts are invariably suggestive of rep resentations in which those who find in primitive art their main source of enchantment might well recog nize themselves.
