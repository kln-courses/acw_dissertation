<plain_text><page sequence="1">COASTAL AND INTERIOR SALISH POWER CONCEPTS: A STRUCTURAL COMPARISON* WILLIAM W. ELMENDORF ABSTRACT Aboriginal concepts of power are analyzed comparatively for two regions of native North America, the southern Northwest Coast and the northern Plateau, using a selected sample of ethnographic materials. A sequential treat- ment of "behaviors related to power shows strik- ing similarities in the structure of belief and ritual in the two areas, as well as con- sistent differences. The sequential analysis is generalized as a paradigmatic model which appears to have applied to varying systems of belief and ritual in the areas treated. His- torical and functional explanations of varying and shared features are suggested; some of the variance is clearly related to varying fea- tures of social structure. Persistence of power concepts, with modification or discon- tinuance of ritual practices associated with these, is seen to be a predictive feature of the model resulting from this analysis. PACIFIC NORTHWEST RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS This study attempts a cross-cultural and in- terareal comparison of aboriginal belief and ritual systems among native peoples of the Pacific Northwest speaking languages which be- long to the Coast and Interior divisions of the Salish linguistic family.1 It defines a shared abstract structure which seems to un- derlie the sometimes striking surface varia- tions in religious culture among these peoples. Formulation of this common structure has been derived from an inductive analysis of ethno- graphic data, covering, it is hoped, a repre- sentative sample of accounts of native pre- reservation cultures of Salish groups. The present analysis, however, concentrates on a general frame or structure of belief and ritual shared by these groups, rather than on a point- for-point comparison of ethnographic items. In contrast to the other contributions to this symposium, the present study does not con- centrate on continuity and change in cere- monialism, except briefly, in a final section. Rather, it is intended to serve here as a kind of base-line analysis, from which change may be projected, even though the major effort in this paper has been to define what change in the post-white period started out from, rather than to describe features of change in themselves. Thus, the major focus of this treatment is on presenting a part of the tra- ditional background of modern religious sys- tems in one part of the Northwest Coast and in a culturally related part of the Plateau area. This traditional base for change is analyzed as a structure, shared by native cultures in the two regions. The structure is presented as a paradig- matic model which would fit the various speci- fic systems of belief and ritual in the area treated and would indicate a consistent set of logical and sequential relations among the various categories of the paradigm. That a common model might apply to aborigi- nal religions over a wide area of northwestern North America is perhaps not too surprising in view of other pattern similarities in cultures of the area. So far as I know, however, a structural analysis of the type proposed here has not previously been attempted for the ethnographic regions occupied by coastal and interior Salish groups.2 These regions are, specifically, a portion of the southern North- west Coast, from southern coastal British Columbia south through western Washington, and an adjoining northern portion of the 64 Arctic Anthropology XIV-19 1977 *I am grateful to the other symposium par- ticipants, particularly to Philip Drucker and Wayne Suttles, for helpful comments; however, responsibility for the present version is my own. Research resulting in this study was aided by a grant from National Science Founda- tion (GS-3678U and Amendment), for which thankful acknowledgment is made. *For definition of these major subgroupings of Salish languages, see Swadesh (1950) and Thompson ( 1973 : 1002-18 ) . 2Levi -Strauss1 (1971) extensive treatment of Sali shan mythological structures rests on a different approach from that tried here.</page><page sequence="2">Elmendorf: Salish Power Concepts 65 intermontane plateau extending east of the Cascade and Coast ranges through southern in- terior British Columbia, the northern half of eastern Washington and a part of northern Idaho and northwestern Montana. These two regions (western and eastern) have long been treated as portions of two different culture areas, the Northwest Coast and the Plateau, respectively. On the basis of extensive ethnographic work during the 1930s Ray (1939:1-3, 1U5) emphasized the dis- tinctive character of Plateau culture, despite obvious influences from adjoining regions. Ray tended to regard Northwest Coast influ- ences on the Plateau as diffusional and rela- tively superficial. On the other hand, Kroeber ( 1939: 28, 55), in a classic study of North American regional cultures, referred to apparently deep and ancient historic connec- tions between the two areas. Although Kroeber did not detail the ethnographic evidence sup- porting this connection, it has become clear that many seemingly fundamental features of native socio-economic culture were in fact closely resemblant in the Plateau and the Northwest Coast. The more obvious similari- ties involve such features as seasonal cycles of food-gathering, the pattern of winter set- tlement, autonomy of local winter communities, winter dependence (at least partial) on pre- served food stores and importance of stream- caught salmon in the subsistence economy. Such similarities in what look like basic patterns are particularly impressive between the northern, Interior Salish, portion of the Plateau and those adjacent sections of the Northwest Coast which Kroeber (1939:29-30) designated as Gulf of Georgia, Puget Sound and Lower Columbia - essentially Drucker!s (1955: 191-92; 3 965:113) Coast Salish-Chinook province. In fact, Drucker (1955:191-92) specifically links this subregion culturally with the Plateau but leaves open the question of whether common heritage or borrowing is in- volved in these resemblances. I hope to demonstrate here that the connection is prob- ably ancient, due to an old common cultural heritage, and that it extends to similarities of patterning and function in belief and ritual systems. The restriction of the present comparative treatment to Salish-speaking peoples only is partly a matter of conveniently limiting a complicated problem. It is definitely not im- plied that neighbors of either the Coast or the Interior Salish in the two regions, who speak languages of other families, are sharply divided from the Salish culturally. Such an assumption would be proved false by comparison of Salish data with such non-Salish ethno- graphic sources as, e.g., Rayfs (1938) for the Lower Chinook, Spier and Sapir fs (1930) for the Upper Chinookan Wishram, or Murdockfs (1938, 1958) for the southern Plateau Sahap- tian Tenino. However, most of the peoples of the Coast Salish-Chinook subregion speak languages of the Salish stock, as do the tribes of the northern Plateau. True, the two groups of languages are very distinct and have seemingly been separated for a long period. Estimated glottochronological dates for the separation of these linguistic divisions, which may be taken only as rough approximations, range from Swadeshfs (l95O:l6o) of U65O-195O B.C. to mine of U9OO-UOOO B.C. (Elmendorf 1965:75). But the coastal-interior relations in language, although not close, are obvious, and coupled with those in other aspects of culture includ- ing religion they raise interesting questions about the dynamics of cultural development in the two regions. To my knowledge, these problems have not heretofore been either satisfactorily formulated or solved. Analysis of native religion may afford an approach to them. Again, for the purpose of delimiting a problem of manageable size, this treatment concentrates on one segment of religious cul- ture; namely, on patterned resemblances be- tween coastal and interior Salish cultures in beliefs and rituals concerned with the concept of power individually obtained from or con- ferred by special animistic beings, that is, the system of ideas and practices conven- tionally referred to as the "guardian spirit complex." This appears to have been a core feature or functionally central subsystem in the native religions of all Salish peoples. "Empowerment" of individuals can be seen as the basic theme in this complex, which in- volved a structured set of concepts and prac- tices shared, in varying "superficial" forms, by Coast and Interior Salish peoples. The in- dividual empowerment notion also appears to have been one of the more persistent features of native religion under conditions of modern acculturative change. Comparative work on this and other aspects of native religion in the Pacific Northwest has been limited in quantity. Among recent writers Drucker (1955:138-57; 1965:83-102) has furnished valuable, though brief, syntheses of religious concepts and practices, but these refer only to the Northwest Coast. Earlier, Ray (1939:68-131) presented a comparative treatment for most Plateau groups, in which some generalizations may need modification in the light of more recent data. Jorgensenfs (1969) statistical analysis of Salish language and culture relationships does cover both coastal and interior groups, and is certainly the most thoroughgoing comparative treatment to date. Further, this work treats both re- ligious and ceremonial features, with inter- esting conclusions regarding relative</page><page sequence="3">66 Arctic Anthropology XIV-1 stability and variability in religious traits (Jorgensen 1969:86-90). However, these con- clusions are the product of a special method, quite different from the approach I have used, and they obviously call for further formula- tion and testing. SALISH INTERGROUP AND INTERAREAL PATTERNS What might be termed "itemization approach- es" to comparative analysis of native religion in the Northwest Coast and Plateau areas have heretofore come up with lists of more or less general features which might be attributed to all or most of the described local cultures of these regions. As an example, in his earlier summary of Northwest Coast religious beliefs and practices, Drucker (1955:138) lists as fundamental and distinctive features of the area: unsystematized concepts of creation, deities and cosmology; supreme being or beings remote and disinterested; ideas and rituals dealing with immortality of some economically important food animals; and, concept of life- long assistance from personal guardian spirit. In a later study (1965:83-102) he adds and discusses several other features as wide- spread, or as important in one or another part of the area: forms of ritual purification, shamanism, sorcery, and a series of regionally differing sorts of public ceremonial perform- ances based on concepts of the supernatural. It is worth noting that, apart from the ex- treme generality of some of them, all of Drucker fs Northwest Coast areal features could apply as well to most described Plateau cul- tures. They are, as formulated, not areally distinctive, although they do label prominent features of native Northwest Coast religious systems. Drucker !s general characterizations would also apply to the Coast Salish subsec- tion of the Northwest Coast, although here some features prominent farther north are ab- sent or little emphasized, while others - es- pecially the con.cept of the personal guardian spirit - assume major importance. And, the em- phasis on guardian spirits is at least as characteristic of the Plateau. The importance of this concept to the Salish was pointed out as long ago as Benedict's (1923) continent- wide study of American Indian guardian spirit beliefs.3 The Northwest Coast is certainly not a cul- turally homogeneous region. Seen from a Plateau viewpoint, much of northern Northwest Coast belief and ritual looks strikingly dif- ferent, if specific local forms are considered rather than the highly generalized items listed by Drucker. But southern Northwest Coast religious systems would appear familiar- ly similar, and this particularly applies to the Coast Salish-Chinook subregion. Detailed sources on Plateau Salish cultures, such as Ray's (1932) study of the central Washington Sanpoil, or Cline fs (1938) on Southern Oka- nagon religion, support this impression of similarity (see also Ray 1939:68-131). In fact, Ray, based on extensive personal re- search with Plateau groups, came to regard much of the culture of Coast Salish-Chinookan peoples as essentially Plateau-like with de- grees of Northwest Coast diffusional overlay (e.g., Ray 1939:108, 110; 1937, 1938 for Lower Chinook).^ Whether or not this Plateau- centered view can be maintained in the light of fuller and better ethnographic data on Coast Salish peoples than was available to Ray in the 1930s, we can at least say that Plateau religious culture appears most like that of the Coast Salish-Chinook subregion but con- siderably different from that of Wakashan peoples (Nootka, Kwakiutl) or groups north of them. It is specifically in guardian spirit and spirit power concepts and associated ritual practices that the Plateau and Coast Salish religious parallels seem most impressive. Some years ago, in comparing personal field notes on Coast Salish Twana and Interior Salish Spokane, I was struck by basic resem- blances in pattern between religious features of these two quite different and widely separated cultures. While all sorts of sur- face details and specific items varied, there appeared to be an underlying structure which could be defined alike for guardian spirit practices in the two groups. This structure did not emerge from itemization treatment, with which I originally approached this two- culture comparison. One type of analysis which did give a glimpse of this common structural base was a sequential definition of behaviors concerned with seeking, acquiring, exhibiting, and using power derived from the guardian spirit rela- tionship. Practices in temporally sequential and functionally linked series were not only 3Benedict (1923: 10) in fact took Teit's (19OO) account of the Interior Salish Thompson as a "type picture of the North American guardian-spirit practices." ^Ray's emphasis on the essentially Plateau-like nature of cultures in the Coast Salish-Chinook subregion is, I feel, overly "Plateaucentric." It is also to be noted that ethnographic" data on Coast Salish were defec- tive in the 1930s, compared to those avail- able for the Plateau. This is in no way to deny the fundamental similarities between the two regions, but merely to suggest that expla- nations other than diffusional overlays, in one direction or the other, may be more satisfactory.</page><page sequence="4">Elmendorf: Salish Power Concepts 67 similar in the two cultures, Twana and Spokane, but the systems of linkage in these series were strikingly alike. I have pre- viously analyzed Twana practices along these lines (Elmendorf 1960:U91, 501-OU, 510-11; 1970; 1973), but have not hitherto extended the sequence-structure analysis to a cross- cultural comparison. Discussion to this point may be summarized by saying that much ethnographic literature for the Pacific Northwest indicates aboriginal sharing of many items of religious culture, particularly items relating to guardian spirit power, among numerous ethnic groups in the Coast Salish and Plateau portions of the re- gion. Further, this sharing extends to func- tionally integrated systems of belief and be- havior, not merely to sets of "traits" or "elements." These resemblances in patterns suggest important questions about native Salish religions, coastal and interior. Among these questions are ones regarding the func- tional relations between religious concepts and rituals in the quite different social- cultural settings of coastal and intermontane groups, and the possibly different roles of diffusion, historical inheritance and adaptive evolution in accounting for shared patterns. On the latter topic, it would be of theo- retical interest to know what sort of proces- sual interpretation of sharing of structural features between Coast Salish and Plateau Salish religious systems we might adopt. Are these sharings due to borrowings in one direc- tion or the other, or because of common reten- tion of features of a proto-Salish culture, or because of convergence due to some sort of evolutionary development? An earlier study of kinship change (Elmendorf 196lb) concluded that evolutionary development might be ex- pected to have produced increasing coast vs . interior differentiation. This appears to have been the case with Salish kinship ter- minologies, and we might also anticipate analogous evolutionary divergence in religious systems. However, if such has occurred, it has not obscured the structural sharings noted above. Furthermore, convergence cannot be ruled out, as evidenced in the startling parallels in power concepts and practices described by Lane (197*0* between parts of Melanesia and parts of the Pacific Northwest. One promising lead to any interpretation of intersocietal cultural sharings in the areas we are considering has been furnished by several recent studies of the dynamics of re- lations among local communities. These in- clude analyses by Suttles (1963) and by the present writer (Elmendorf 1960:298-305, U01- 07, 56O ; 1971) on the nature and consequences of inter village ties among different Coast Salish groups, and parallel work for Plateau groups by Anastasio (1972), Brunton (1968), and Walker (1967). These studies demonstrate that some of the mechanisms involved in inter- societal sharings operated through a system of social networks which linked individuals and kin groups in different local communities over a large part of the Pacific Northwest. The network connections served as diffusional channels with respect to specific activities, both within the southern Northwest Coast and the Plateau, and between these areas. Shar- ings in religious concepts and practices are probably, at least in part, due to the opera- tion of this network. Jorgensen (1969:87) considers such con- tacts the major reason for the presence of shared religious elements: . . . practices which attend the life cycle and other public ceremonies, as well as many religious beliefs about guardian spirits, sickness and so on, are shared by neighbors because they maintain indefinitely many contacts through marriage, mutual exploitation of resources and attendance at one another's major ceremonials. There seems little doubt that diffusion, through intergroup networks, is one factor in these religious sharings, but I do not believe that it is the only factor. Some of the pat- terns shared seem old, basic, and not readily explicable by diffusion, as are some specific elements. CATEGORIES OF NATIVE RELIGION: SOUTHERN NORTHWEST COAST AND PLATEAU In any cross-cultural comparison, problems of analysis and determination of categories are crucial in deciding what to compare, and whether we are truly dealing with comparabilia between different societies, cultures or systems. Research in ethnoscience during the 1960s should have left us aware, if we were not before, of the need to criticize and justify the imposing of categorizing labels in ethnographic description. Regardless of the successes (Tyler 1969) or possible short- comings (Keesing 1972) of the techniques and results of ethnoscience inquiry, this has amply demonstrated that sophistication of methods and concepts has to be involved in any ethnographic labeling that will permit valid inter system comparison. (Cf., Goodenough 1970:2.) "Religion" has long been a notoriously slippery category in anthropology, difficult to define and difficult to apply consistently in cross-cultural comparison. I have been influenced in the present treatment by several recent statements concerning the problem of how to apply this category comparatively or generally or et i c ally. Frake's (l96U:115,</page><page sequence="5">68 Arctic Anthropology XIV r-l 127), to the effect that the category must be stated first in terms of the cultural system being described, is taken as a basic assump- tion. Both Wallace (1966:107) and Glick (1973:226) present analytical definitions which seem particularly well to fit Salish in- stances; both stress control of and applica- tion of extra-human power to human goals, and Wallace specifies the means to such applica- tion as "a set of rituals, rationalized by myth."5 Although purportedly general and etic, these formulations accord remarkably well with descriptive data from a number of culturally varying Salish societies. Religion here will be taken to include belief systems ("myth rationalizations") underlying and sup- porting ritual systems, which in turn are goal-directed toward what Wallace ( 1966:106) terms "transformations of state." Now, if we apply this working definition - or better, categorization - to Salish religion, coastal or interior, we find a series of sub- categories which fall within it. Determining these subcategories of beliefs, rituals and associated goals does not seem to follow from analysis of trait listings or itemized fea- tures. Rather, an emically valid determina- tion emerges only from a relational treatment, in which religions are seen as parts, sub- systems, within larger sociocultural systems, and their systemic position and functional linkages are defined. This agrees with Miller's (196U) insistence on the need for examining the rubric "religion" in specific cases not only as myth, belief, or ritual per se, but also as these involve linkage with other aspects of the society under investiga- tion. I have made a preliminary attempt at such a systemic treatment of a Coast Salish reli- gion in my study of Twana ethnography (Elmen- dorf 1960:U80-539). Here, major religious categories were defined by belief systems and associated or derived systems of rituals, and further by the different kinds and degrees of functional association of these with other cultural subsystems. In this particular Coast Salish culture there were found to be four complex categories which seemed thoroughly in- tegrated with one another and with other im- portant aspects of the culture: l) guardian spirits, 2) shamanism, 3) souls, ghosts, af- terworlds, k) magic techniques, including sorcery. In addition, a fifth rather miscel- laneous category showed less integration with other features of the culture; this included beliefs and rituals regarding game animals and their souls, omens, cosmology and a number of purely verbal folkloristic or mythical beliefs without direct behavioral expression. There is reason to believe that analysis of Plateau area ethnographic sources might give comparable results. Certainly, some recent integrative treatments, notably Walker (1968) for the Sahaptian Nez Perce and Brunton (1968) for Interior Salish groups, have made clear the intimate functional connections of reli- gion and other features of social behavior, and the persistence of these connections into present-day reservation societies. All these analyses demonstrate close functional ties of belief and ritual systems with other features of the social systems involved; specifically, the system of social roles. It is these roles which represent in aboriginal Salish cultures the transformations of state, in Wallace's terms, toward which belief /ritual systems are goal-directed. And in both Plateau and south- ern Northwest Coast cultures it is guardian spirit-conferred power which represents con- ceptually the principal means of establishment or enhancement of adult roles . Consequently, the guardian spirit /power category may be considered for the areas here treated as a basic subcategory of native re- ligion, and as involving the most important set of linkages between belief, ritual and other aspects of native social systems. Fur- ther, the linkages or relational connections appear consistently ordered in different Salish ethnographic cases. This leads me to designate the spirit/power notion and its associations as a "core element" of Salish religions, utilizing a term from Stanner !s admirable analysis of aboriginal Australian religion. Stanner (l96U:U) stresses the ordering of observable acts "within a well- unified total activity" as a defining feature of "core elements" in a religious complex. This Salish core element includes not only the notions of power -grant ing spirits, of ritual means to attainment of such granted power and of consequent effects on the carry- ing out of social roles. It also involves fundamental connections with Salish concepts of myth. I have discussed elsewhere Coast Salish concepts of myth and of power, and their relations to various types of behaviors and to native terminology (Elmendorf 196la:l- 19; 1970:152-5^; 1973). In summary, power was obtained from extra-human sources, conceptual- ly connected with a prehuman mythic world, maintained and controlled through ritual prac- tices and used to serve human ends. Aborigi- nally, the principal source of power was a class of animistic entities, the guardian 5I sympathize with Stanner !s (l96U:vii) os- tensive definition of religion, with reference to an Australian aboriginal culture; viz., "That kind of belief and conduct." However, the further question remains, of what kind of belief and conduct, whether with respect to a single system (the ernie answer) or to a series of varying systems (approaching the etic answer ) .</page><page sequence="6">Elmendorf: Salish Power Concepts 69 spirits, obtained, controlled and used through a five-stage sequence of ritual practices. Once obtained and under full control, power was used to rationalize adult performance; social roles were in theory enhanced or at times made possible by guardian spirit-conferred power. This general pattern for coastal Salish peoples shows close correspondence with most Plateau Salish groups. Within this basic power belief /ritual pat- tern, all sorts of surface details varied with locale and ethnic identity. Twana formula- tions and ritual procedures regarding guardian spirits were superficially quite different from those of the Sanpoil or the Southern Okanagon. Yet the agreement in basic pattern features was remarkably close. What perhaps varied most widely according to region, in this aboriginal pattern, were details of the role structure resting concep- tually on a spirit- power basis. It is these details which rather sharply distinguished coastal from interior native social struc- tures. And, since roles were in supposed correspondence with particular kinds of power, these classifications of power types did dif- fer between Coast and Interior Salish, and in- deed among different sections of the Coast Salish, who were by no means a homogeneous cultural block. (Cf., Elmendorf 1971:355-56, 365-67, and Ray 1939:2^-30 for the Plateau.) It is striking that social systems as dif- ferent in some important respects , notably in status ranking, as those of the Coast Salish region and the Plateau, could share a common conceptual and ritual structure, relating Dower to performance. SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS AND PARADIGMATIC MODEL Long ago Benedict (1923:10-12) noted that typical elements of guardian spirit concepts in much of native North America corresponded to a ritual sequence, whereby power was ob- tained from guardian spirits and put to use for human ends. For apparently all Coast and Interior Salish aboriginal religions on which adequate data are available, a specific se- quence of ritual activities characterized the acquisition and control of spirit power, in the majority of instances in which individuals obtained such power. Exceptional cases which did not accord with this sequence usually in- volved merely truncation or omission of some of its stages, rather than a totally dissimi- lar pattern. There were cases where the guar- dian spirit of a dead relative might trouble the dreams of a living person, seeking to at- tach itself to him or her. Power from such a spirit might be acquired by methods which es- sentially bypassed much of the questing and vision-encountering rituals of the normal sequence. (Cf., Elmendorf 1960:^98-99 for a Coast Salish example.) It is noteworthy that this once exceptional pattern of spirit "in- heritance" appears to have become the usual method of power acquisition in present-day Coast Salish societies. In the normal aboriginal pattern each ac- tivity was linked temporally and functionally to the one following it; temporally, simply in the sense of priority in time, and function- ally in a sense defined by Goodenough (1970: 109), in that each element in the sequence served as a necessary prerequisite to the one following it (Cf . , also the analyses in Elmendorf 1960:^91-98, 501-OU, 510-12). Sequence analysis of cultural behaviors and possible use of sequenee patterns in setting up comparative models has received fairly ex- tensive treatment going back at least as far as van GennepTs 1908 account of "rites of passage" (Gennep 1960:vii, 191; see also Stanner 196U:137-38; Hymes 1962).6 Hymes, in the article cited, also notes how a sequence paradigm frame can be set up for comparative purposes, while Dundes (1971:171-72), dis- cussing approaches to mythological tales, con- trasts sequential with binary-oppositional analyses in setting up different types of structural models. In the present case what is sought is a sequential paradigm which will represent accurately the relationships among elements in core aspects of Coast and Interior Salish religious systems and will serve as a valid etic frame for cross-cultural comparison of these systems. Since it includes relations among diverse mythic, conceptual, ritual and social elements, it can perhaps not be as tightly coherent as some models derived from a narrower range of more homogeneous material, such as mythic narratives . To generalize from a range of Salish ethno- graphic accounts, coastal and interior,7 we may say that in Salish cultures individual ac- quisition of spirit power involved a sequence of ritualized activities in which each item or ^Sequential analysis appears fundamental to Van Gennep fs formulations: "Our interest lies not in the particular rites but in their es- sential significance and their relative posi- tions within ceremonial wholes - that is, their order ..." (Gennep 1960:191). 7The principal references used here were, for Coast Salish: Barnett 1955 (British Co- lumbia groups), Collins 1971* (Upper Skagit), Elmendorf i960, 19^0 ms . (Twana), Gunther 1927 (Clallam), Haeberlin and Gunther 1930 (Puget Sound groups), Olson 1936 (Quinault), Smith 19U0 (Puyallup-Ni squally).

There appear to be five such elements in the normal sequence pattern. In order, these are: A training procedures, B seeking or questing for spirit, C encounter with spirit in vision^ D return of seeker to human society, E sup- pression or "forgetting" of details of vision experience (C). The functional -sequential relations of these elements can be indicated as: (- » ) A- &gt; B- » C- » D- » E ( - » ) The parenthesized arrow leading to A indi- cates that training procedures are activated by a "mentor" (Ray's term) who has undergone the entire sequence. Usually this is a kins- man or kinswoman of the novice trainee, in a previous generation (ideally, the grand- parental one). The last arrow, leading from E, indicates further activities necessary for final control of the obtained power, and ulti- mate reversal of role, from novice to mentor. Thus, one function of these further activities concerns the role of mentor (trainer ship) vis- a-vis the younger relative (trainee); hence, the model "loops" in replicating itself over the period of two or more generations, assur- ing social transmission and continuity of the sequence: -+A + B + C+D + E + (further control) N v - - - - - (generation space) •«------ - The above model refers specifically to ritual activities involved in power-getting by an individual from guardian spirit sources. However, this ritual sequence has a wider setting, in which its relation appears to be that of a single element in a more inclusive system which links myth concepts with social reality. This larger system likewise appears to be shared by coastal and interior Salish cultures. It represents for these aboriginal religions a common paradigmatic model which applies to the general relations among con- ceptual elements connecting power and social roles. The major features of this more com- prehensive model may be suggested in the formulation which follows: I Myth World - II Guardian Spirits - III Ritual Sequence (A-E) - IV Personal Control and Exhibition of Power - V Empowered Role. The arrangement of the five features of this model represents a series of conceptual derivatives. The relations among these are only roughly sequential or temporal. Guardian spirits (il), power -conferring entities, are in one sense the manifestations in the present world of prehuman myth-age beings ( I ) , and the powers which they confer are often associated with or interpreted through the myth-roles of these beings.8 To obtain, con- trol and use such powers (ill, IV) requires a sequential series of ritual activities often extending over several years of an individual's life. Once in full control and use (IV), spirit-conferred power determines, enhances, explains the social performance of adult in- dividuals (V). Thus, social structure and myth, or rather special features of social structure and myth concepts, are linked or mediated in this model through a complex of power-acquiring and power- controlling rituals. The integration of myth, ritual and role structure is a tight one in aboriginal Salish cultures. A more detailed indication of this integration may be sug- gested in the diagrammatic representation of the basic paradigmatic model shown in Fig. 1. * In Fig. 1, I to V denote the conceptual features defined above. Note that III, the power-acquisition ritual sequence, likewise involves five stages, A to E (training, seek- ing, vision, return, suppression), and that the central element in this sequence (C, vision) can also be analyzed as normally con- taining five elements. These can be roughly denoted by such labels as: C 1, appearance or manifestation of guardian spirit, usually with anthropomorphic appearance, and often with auditory impression before visual impression; 8Stray remarks to this effect are scattered through the literature but are often hard to locate. The statement probably holds general- ly for the regions treated, particularly if we compare myth roles and the present powers im- puted to particular guardian spirits. Ray (1932:177-78) specifically asserts this rela- tion between myth-age beings and present-day guardian spirits for the Plateau Sanpoil, and I received the same information for the Coast Salish Twana (Elmendorf 19-60 :U85-88, 535-36; 196la: 8). I also noted the absence of guar- dian spirits in Twana myths (l96la:l8) and Benedict (l923:8l) called attention to the same phenomenon for the Thompson. I assume this as a bit of evidence that myth beings were guardian spirits, or better, that the guardian spirit is a present-day manifestation of a myth being in this world. If so, guar- dian spirits as a separate type of character could not be expected to appear in narrations of the myth age. All this would accord with Levi -Strauss1 general remark that although myth is long ago, "it also explains the pres- ent and past, as well as the future."

The vision experience thus appears, in comparative analysis, to be a complex but con- sistently patterned event. ^ I have also indicated within the ritual se- quence (ill) correspondence of its stages to the ritual three-phase or stage scheme (schema) of van Gennep (l960:2l), as further defined and interpreted by Campbell (19^9:10, 35), Stanner (l96U:17l) and Turner (196U). The correspondence is remarkable, especially since all these variants of van Gennep fs scheme were developed without reference to aboriginal Salish religion. It seems clear that during the separation stage (ill A, B) the spirit seeker progressively leaves the so- cial world, both subjectively and physically (in lone questing), that during the transition stage (ill C) he enters or contacts the myth world, and that in the stage of incorporation (ill D, E) he is progressively, through the shedding of a series of ritual restrictions and ultimate "forgetting," brought back into the social world. Feature IV demands further explanation. This is actually a series of additional ritual acts, demanded or forced by the empowering spirit, through which recall of the vision ex- perience (III C) occurs, full rapport between spirit and human partner is brought about, and full control of power by the human recipient is assured. The central element, particularly for other than shamanistic powers, is the win- ter "spirit dance" or public ritual manifesta- tion of the "return" of the power and its con- trol. This feature might be considered an ad- ditional element in the sequence III A to E, except for its temporal separation from III E by a kind of dormancy period (sometimes for 20 years or more), and the fact that its ethno- graphic details between different Salish groups seem to vary independently of those in feature III. Finally, V indicates the fully empowered adult individual playing his role/roles in society, with the nature of these roles ra- tionalized or explained by the specific charac- ter of all the other features in the model. Thus, the model does not purport to analyze just myth structure or ritual structure, but represents a more inclusive structure within which myth, ritual and social structure are all involved in a system of concepts and e- vents which lead to the empowerment of in- dividuals, by which they are enabled to play adult roles in human society. The overall theme is empowerment, leading to social trans- formation. It should be added that the concept of "power" cannot here be categorically, or in native terminology, separated from that of the "spirit" conferring the power (see Elmendorf 19T3). What we have in the general Salish scheme is a single key concept, in the sense designated by Leach (1971:W as an agent of transformation which can be inferred to appear whenever a specific kind of change of condition is effected. This key concept might be de- noted by the compound term spirit-power, which would at least involve less ernie distortion of Salish concepts than would continued terminological separation of its two elements. Each of the features and subsidiary states of the above model can be regarded as varia- bles, to which specific values may be as- signed, according to ethnographic variation between local groups and sections of society. However, as a general structure, the model would seem to apply interareally to aboriginal cultures of both Coast and Interior Salish peoples. RELIGIOUS CHANGE AND THE ABORIGINAL PARADIGM Although it is not proposed here to deal with the extensive and complex subject of post-aboriginal change in Salish religious systems, one question raised by the foregoing analysis may be considered briefly. How has the aboriginal model analyzed above fared during the past century and more of accultu- rative change? Specifically, to what extent does it still serve as a paradigm, directing religious behavior or serving as an ordering conceptual scheme? Offhand, one might expect that this closely integrated system would have come apart, dissolved or disappeared in the course of the reservation period, since the mid-19th century. I do not think, however, that this has been exactly the case. After about 185O, all native peoples in the Pacific Northwest underwent a series of dras- tic social changes, introduced, controlled and in large part forced by agents of Euro- American culture. During this period changes in religious systems have accompanied those in the rest of native culture. A present-day ac- count of Indian reservation communities in the southern Northwest Coast and Plateau would note these three principal results of such religious change: l) Many Indian populations adhere to some 9This is clear in a series of narrated Twana guardian spirit experiences (Elmendorf 19^0 ms.), and in a variety of published ac- counts, e.g., Collins 197^:l6O (Skagit), Cline 1938:139 (Southern Okanagon), Ray 1932:183-85 (Sanpoil) .</page><page sequence="10">Elmendorf : Salish Power Concepts 73 missionary-introduced version of Christianity, usually accompanied to a greater or lesser ex- tent by ostensible rejection of earlier be- liefs and practices. 2) At least some portions of some reserva- tion societies still show selective retention of older, pre-Christian beliefs and rituals, as in the modern spirit dancing described by Suttles (i960, 1963) for British Columbia Coast Salish or by Collins ( 197^:21+2) for the western Washington Skagit. (Cf., also Amoss, this issue.) 3) there are several syncretic or nativi s- tic systems, which have arisen since the be- ginnings of white contact; e.g., prophet cults and the Indian Shaker sect. In all of these modern systems, some per- sistence of native concepts seems probable. This has indeed been documented for specific cases, as in Gunther's (19^9) or Collins1 (1950) or Smith's (195*0 accounts of Coast Salish Shakers, and Walker's (1968) study of Christian sects among the southern Plateau Nez Perce. However, the paradigm expressed in the model suggested above must have been altered in all these modern situations, whose social bases are so different from those of pre- reservation times. What might be predicted as a major change in the aboriginal system is truncation, ab- breviation, simplification, or collapsing of its elaborate ritual sequences, activation of which appears to have depended on conditions of aboriginal society no longer in existence. Along with such acculturative simplification or elimination of ritual details, one might expect a greater persistence of certain basic conceptual features, particularly those con- nected with the notion of individual empower- ment. Also, it seems plausible that the general relational structure of the aboriginal paradigm might show persistence, even in new religious systems whose surface features ap- pear almost wholly different from those of pre- white belief and ritual. What research results have appeared so far on acculturative religious systems in native Northwest societies do suggest agree- ment with these general predictions. This is perhaps most marked in the cases of modern spirit dancing, as might be expected, al- though even here there are notable diver- gences from the patterns of a century to a century and a half ago. Indian Shakerism, well described in a whole series of accounts since the l880s, could also be analyzed as a confirming case, while the largely unstudied field of modern Indian versions of introduced Christian sects might also yield significant and interesting results. Inquiry into these topics seems a promising opportunity for future re- search. SUMMARY The following points may be concluded from the above treatment : 1) A common paradigm applied to aboriginal ritual practices relating to acquisition and use of supernatural power over a wide area of the Pacific Northwest, specifically portions of the southern Northwest Coast and the Plateau. 2) Paradigm similarity was particularly close between rituals and power concepts of Salish-speaking groups in the two areas. 3) Within the paradigm as a relational frame, relations of power concepts and ritual system indicate a concept scheme functionally basic to ritual. This implies that similari- ties of power-associated rituals among Salish peoples may be determined by a common concep- tual or ideological base. h) Regional variations in ritual practices and associated concepts are in certain cases clearly to be connected with variations in social structure, as with differing coastal vs. interior status systems. In all cases a consistent tie with social structure results from interpretation of adult social roles as specific results of empowerment. 5) Continuity features of the aboriginal paradigm under acculturative change since the beginning of reservation conditions seem to show that: a) maximum persistence is seen in particular features of the aboriginal belief system probably accompanied by associated systems of values and social attitudes; b) these persistent beliefs rest on a general relational system in the paradigm, having to do with individual empowerment; c) ritual se- quences once associated with acquisition and use of supernatural power have undergone greater adaptive modification than has the structure of beliefs which once supported them.
