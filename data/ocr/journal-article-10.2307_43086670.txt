<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Editor's Guide to Periphrasis John Kador EDITORS' RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR CLIENTS can suffer if the blue pencilled comments in the margin are too blunt . No one likes to be told repeatedly that his writing is "wordy" or that his meaning is unclear. One way to avoid such insults to use the terms of classical rhetorics, as suggested here (with tongue only partly in check). One occupational liability of editing is that we're often called upon to insult the writers whose work we edit. If there's any- thing satisfactory about this situation, it's that, more often than not, the writers them- selves insist that we interpret and justify the little red marks we make in the margins. It's the strongest support we have for the con- cept of poetic justice. Most writers grudgingly accept changes in punctuation, verb agreement, and spell- ing, but let us make a real change in diction or syntax and resentment generally follows. How can it be otherwise when we're forced to justify our changes using such words as awkward, clumsy, choppy, redundant, ambig- uous, and long-windedl Such terms are loaded with negative connotations that do not help the situation. If we could only couch those same terms in a less provocative code, we could elimi- nate the bitterness and still keep our changes. Luckily, the splendor of the Eng- lish language offers an alternative to the pejorative implications of many of the words we need. The device of periphrasis (see be- low) allows us to label our reasons for mak- ing changes without offending the writer. For how many writers will be offended by a charge of periphrastic writing? By the time they look it up, all offense is gone. The following lexicon of periphrastic ed- itorial terms can make our work much more pleasant. Each term is followed by a defi- nition and an example or two of the device in use. PERIPHRASIS "Preparatory to precipitately pursuing a course of action, conduct a thorough survey of the situation." Even if the author of this sentence looked before he leapt, he's still guilty of periphrasis. In simple language, it's overblown, wordy, and oblique. But you risk an argument with such terms. Give the au- thor with an aversion to direct and common wording a taste of his own syntax. Note periphrasis and be done with it. AMPHIBOLOGIA Amphibology is ambiguity arising from a grammatical construction that can be un- derstood in more than one way. "The lobby door opened and a young woman carrying her baby and her husband entered." Neat trick, if she can do it. As editor, you can label it vague or confusing and risk a scene, or you can let it go as amphibological, avoid- ing any unpleasantness. PLEONASM When the author makes a meaningless repetition of words used more than once (as in this sentence), you have two options. You can float like a butterfly (pleonastic) or you can sting like a bee ( redundant ). Both words can be picked up at the Complaints Desk near the Department of Redundancy De- partment, but only with the ten dollar word is satisfaction guaranteed. ASYNDETON Some writers use a dense, superconcen- trated style, omitting conjunctions and prep- ositions from constructions in which they would normally be used. "Preventing cata- lyst selectivity deterioration is difficult" be- comes, when you add prepositions and ar- ticles, "It is difficult to prevent the selectivity of the catalyst from deteriorating." Instead of possibly alienating the author of the first sentence with too turgid, try asyndetic. That'll teach him not to discriminate against the undersized parts of speech. POLYSYNDETON The only problem with applying asynde- ton is that the properly rebuked author may embrace the opposite extreme: using more conjunctions, prepositions, and articles than would ordinarily be necessary. "Connect the ground wire to the coil and to the trans- former and to the solenoid and then to the battery." Telling the author that this is babytalk won't get you very far. On the other hand, a pronouncement of polysyn- detonic would likely cause him to seek the happy median where the proper proportion of functional words makes the structure of the sentence clear. ANAPHORA It should be pointed out that some authors have an annoying habit of starting every sentence or paragraph with the same phrase. It should be pointed out that such a habit is considered very poor writing. It should be pointed out that anaphora is deliberate rep- etition which, in the hands of a skilled writer, can be very effective. It should be pointed out that a notation of monotonous in this case would be meiosis (see below); nothing less than anaphoric would induce the author to abandon this noxious habit. EUPHEMISM Euphemism is the substitution of an in- offensive term for one considered offen- sively explicit. In this area, the editor has to be on guard when failures or setbacks are being reported. The careful reader is not amused by 'The experiment reflected un- certain results" when the experiment failed. Similarly, he wants to know that someone was fired, not rendered unemployed. In such cases, the editor can accuse the author of weaseling, but of course he will not. If any- thing, the author is euphemistic. AMBAGE Closely related to euphemism (but easier to spell) is ambage, an intentionally evasive and deceptive circumlocution. Deceit is the motive here, not prudery. A charge of am- bage would be justified for such a claim as "During the first test of the component, a pressure surge occurred. A search for the missing parts was initiated." Fortunately, this type of knavery is rare, but when an editor does see it, it's important to call a spade an ambage. HYPERBOLE How should an editor redline a statement 10 Technical Communication, Third Quarter 1978</page><page sequence="2">such as "With proper maintenance, the com- ponent should last a million years"? You can invite resentment with overstated or you can quietly mark in the margin, hyperbole. After he looks it up, the author will be sure to avoid wildly extravagant and exaggerated statements. MEIOSIS Rarely, all too rarely, an author is guilty of the opposite fault, understatement: "The second time the component exploded, the project manager seemed troubled." The ed- itor must resist the temptation to note the understatement of the year , and should sub- stitute meiosis. The subtlety will not be lost on the author. PERISSOLOGIA Writers sometimes are long-winded, using more words than are necessary to express a thought. Such cumbersome writing is so easy to detect that no example is necessary. A general term for needlessly wordy lan- guage is perissologia. Make your changes short and sweet and let him look it up. PROSOPOEIA Assigning human qualities to inanimate objects is personification. This device rarely has a place in technical writing, where its effect is inevitably cloying. Unfortunately, a recent "homegrown" trend in technical writing results in such anthropomorphic personifications as "The system had a bad Monday morning hangover and couldn't be powered up." Another word for this device is prosopoeia. In this case, use it. CACOZELIA When an editor encounters a writer who exhibits his learning or scholarship ostenta- tiously, he must tread lightly, for the author will be prepared to defend his pedantry and affected style. Certainly he will resent stilted or bookish , but to cacozeliac he might be sympathetic. SOLECISM In most cases, however, the editor finds nonspecific violations of grammar and dic- tion. This is the stuff of which Edwin New- man's books are filled. By now you should agree that all you need to note as you raise your red marker is solecism , a nonstandard usage or grammatical construction. √ç2 About the Author . . . JOHN KADOR is a Senior Technical Writer/ Editor at Tesdata Systems Corpora- tion, McLean, Virginia. He prepares user doc- umentation for the company's computer prod- ucts. Previous to his association with Tesdata, he was with American Instrument Company, Silver Spring, Maryland, where he co-edited Fluorescence News, an international quart- erly. Mr. Kador holds a B.A. degree in Eng- lish with a minor in chemistry from Duke University. He is currently enrolled in the Public Information Administration program in the graduate school of American Univer- sity, Washington, D.C. " . . Look at the Past , " coni, from p. 9 the topic need be sanctioned by STC, and one respondent answered "no" with a gentle slap at those who lack the intellectual curi- osity to pursue this subject matter on their own. However, on the whole, the topic proved to be one that many professionals would like to see STC continue its involve- ment with - at least on a modest scale. Question Three : What was your reaction to the session? The personal reactions here were most encouraging. One called the session "the icing on the cake" for a very satisfying conference. It was clear that some had been stimulated by the papers, and it was equally clear that at least a few had an impressive knowledge of the history of technical com- munication. Some offered constructive crit- icism. For example, Professor Thomas Saw- yer of the University of Michigan observed that knowing the history of technology or science is "more important" for a technical communicator than an awareness of the his- tory of technical communication. Two sent copies of Walter J. Miller's fine article "What Can the Technical Writer of the Past Teach the Technical Writer of Today?"12 to remind me that the topic is not entirely new. (I neglected at the conference to mention that Miller's article had been most helpful to me in investigating the history of techni- cal communication.) While these positive responses to the pa- pers and the session were gratifying, I must admit that my questionnaire reached a very limited number of STC members. Yet I sense that the responses are indeed repre- sentative of the total membership of STC. A FINAL QUESTION One concluding question seems appropri- ate: What then really is to be gained when technical communicators face the past? Throughout my discussion here, I have tried to touch on scattered bits and pieces of an answer. I believe that there are practical benefits to reading the work of past scientific and technical writers, but they do not out- weigh the value of the new perspectives on professional self-esteem awaiting the mod- ern technical communicator who recognizes that he is part of a highly respected tradition. The professional who lacks this perspective is much like the character described by Wordsworth as being filled with the Blank misgivings of a creature, Moving about in worlds not realized. In short, an awareness of one's past clarifies one's view of the present and elevates one's expectations of the future. il REFERENCES 1.
