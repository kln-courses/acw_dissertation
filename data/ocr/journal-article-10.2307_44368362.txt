<plain_text><page sequence="1">WOLF OF THE BEES: GERMANIC SHAMANISM AND THE BEAR HERO Stephen O. Glosecki Abstract Undeniably , the Beowulf story as we have it was recorded long after the Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England . Nevertheless , the Old English epic preserves significant traces of native Germanic myth. Addressing itself to vestiges of this mythos, this paper connects animal imagery in Beowulf with its analogues in other early Germanic sources, both literary and iconographie. Most likely, the ubiquitous animal motifs reflect migration-age warrior cults that invoked strong beasts as eponymous protectors. In particular, literary, graphic and etymological evidence suggests that magico -religious attitudes toward the bear- the spirit companion of the strongest heroes- waned slowly while Iron-Age nations evolved into the Germanic states of feudal Europe. Ultimately, the belief in animal guardians- a belief shared by other, unrelated tribal peoples- probably stems from prehistoric Germanic shamanism. ♦** In the past few decades the term shaman has occasionally appeared in discussions of early Germanic literature and culture. Such references are usually isolated and brief. H.R. Ellis Davidson is exceptional in that she devotes eight pages to Odin's shamanic attributes, e.g., his riding on the eight-legged horse Sleipnir ("the typical steed of the shaman"), his journeying to the underworld, his hanging on Yggdrasil ("the center of the shaman's cosmology"), his tendencies toward shape-shifting, his reputation as a seer, etc. (141-49). Emphasizing Odin's role as "the bringer of ecstasy," Davidson mentions the etymology of Wodan, a name cognate with the Germanic wat, meaning "high mental excitement, fury, intoxication, or possession." Since anthro- pologists generally consider the use of ecstasy the sine qua non of shamanism, this etymology, when viewed alongside the rest of Davidson's evidence, firmly links the chief Germanic god to a fully elaborated shamanic tradition-a tradition pervasive enough among the prehistoric northern tribes to have left its mark upon the literature that developed among their descendants in northern Europe, Britain and Iceland during the early Middle Ages. Davidson's treatment of this etymology is convincing, but less complete than that presented by Haakon Shetelig earlier in this century.1 Shetelig's discussion is important because it expands the limits of ancient ecstatic practice beyond the confines of Germanic culture to the Italic, and thus tempts us to seek a source of Germanic shamanism among the early Indo-Europeans. The temptation grows stronger when we add the Greek enthousiasmos to his list of terms; though not an etymon, this word meaning "possession by a god" indicates the same culture trait: ecstasy. However, a search for the ultimate source of Germanic shamanism-whether Indo-European society itself, or an auto- 31</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Ritual Studies 2/1 1988 chthonous Finno-Ugrian substratum absorbed by proto-Germanic invaders during a distant phase of the Neolithic-is beyond the scope of this paper. Shetelig's discussion is also important because it represents an early effort to place Germanic ecstatic practice in the broad context of tribalism at large, where I believe it logically belongs. Hence we will return to "the Siberian shaman, and the Indian medicine-men" in an effort to illuminate the preliterary shamanic tradition that had some bearing upon the development of important Germanic works like the Old English epic Beowulf. Typical of the more recent references to shamanism in Germanic studies is George Speake's single but provocative sentence in his treatment of predatory bird figures in Anglo-Saxon animal art (a treatment in its turn indebted to the aforementioned work by Davidson): "the interpretation must be that the birds represent the mind of Odin as seer or shaman" (82). Less typical are A. M. Arenťs relatively frequent references to shamanism in "The Heroic Pattern: Old Germanic Helmets, Beowulf ' and Grettis Saga." Although her purpose is neither to define the term fully nor apply it extensively, Arent does establish its relevance to the study of early Germanic culture (136): Animal names for individuals and tribes, depictions and later descriptions of the wearing of animal masks, of theriomorphic transformations, of the appearance of the ancestors or the dead in animal form, and so on attest to shamanistic beliefs among the Germanic tribes. Such animal affinities found obvious expression in warrior groups like the berserfeir (bear-skins) or the ulfhethnar (wolf-skins). Such a clear statement of the case is exceptional; more typical is Marijane Osborn and Stella Longlanďs incidental assertion that the opening stanza of the Old English Rune Poem "contains a shamanistic dimension in the reference to the casting of lots" (27). Among such references to Germanic shamanism-references all the more intriguing on account of their usual brevity, obscurity and isolation-Peter Foote's note to Chapter 18 of The Saga ofGisli is especially compelling because its very terseness implies the foregone conclusion that shamanistic practices were current in medieval Iceland, Norway, and by extension-since Viking culture, like Amerindian, despite geographical variation, is generally regarded as uniform-the North Germanic world at large: a spell: seithr in the Icelandic, a type of shamanistic magic-working, probably borrowed by the Norwegians from their Lapp neighbors, although some people think it has more ancient Germanic origins (Johnston and Foote 79). According to Foote, then, shamanic ritual persisted in Norway and Iceland until well into the historical period, and the sagas-however much one may emphasize their obvious fictionalizing of actual events (e.g., Allen 13-27; Andersson 49- 50)-can be mined for evidence of genuine Norse practice. 32</page><page sequence="3">Glosecki: Wolf of the Bees I would expand upon Foote's tacit assumption that the sagas reflect actual practice and are not simply colorful figments of the Icelandic imagination. Although their heroes are larger than life, with exploits duly exaggerated, the sagas are nonetheless repositories of traditional lore handed down from the Migration Period and preserved, with inevitable distortion, by those northernmost Germanic peoples who resisted Mediterranean influence longer than their cousins who migrated south, such as the Anglo-Saxons. It makes sense that the sagas and eddas should retain certain common Germanic traits, highly romanticized, of course, but genuine, nonetheless. Some of these traits have their reflexes in Old English literature, too, especially in Beowulf and the metrical charms, although here they are obscured by the sustained efforts of the medieval Church to eradicate the old heathen folkways. As Arent writes: Of all the Germanic heroic epics, the Beowulf poem stands both chronologically and spiritually closest to the mythical origin. . . .The two religious streams, pagan and Christian, converged in Beowulf ( 1 49 ). So when contemporary scholars briefly refer to shamanism in their discussions of Germanic art, they are recognizing a pre- Christian culture trait that was simply too pervasive to disappear completely from post-migration societies drawn progressively fartner away from their original Baltic sphere of influence. Granted such a situation, it stands to reason that the Norse Saga writers, who were simply farther from Rome than the Anglo- Saxons, would retain sharp fragments of the shamanic tradition in their works, whereas the Anglo-Saxons would incorporate only occasional reflexes (perhaps more arcane to them than they are to us today, with the hindsight made possible by our diachronic point of view). Sporadically, scholars working independently of one another have noticed isolated shamanic elements in early Germanic art. My purpose is to focus more closely upon a few of these ancient northern culture traits that had considerable impact upon the Beowulf legend in its formative stages. In the decades following Tolkien's extremely influential lecture delivered at Oxford in 1936 ("Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics"), mainstream Old English criticism tended to avoid sifting through the epic to find evidence of continental Germanic customs. Since Tolkien urged critics to see Beowulf as a work of art rather than a storehouse of ethnographic data, Augustinián approaches, which emphasize the Christian orientation of the epic, have predominated. It has thus been unfashionable to recognize native Germanic elements in the Old English epic, a work composed well after the conversion to Christianity. Nonetheless, some scholars have pursued this line of inquiry, for instance, A. M. Arent, Brian Branston, H.R. Ellis Davidson, Gwyn Jones, Francis P. Magoun, Jeff Opland, Thomas Pettitt, T.A. Shippey, and more recently, John D. Niles in Beowulf: The Poem 33</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Ritual Studies 2/1 1988 and Its Traditions. Opland and Niles both work with oral- formulaic theory, which by its very nature presupposes an early Germanic source for the complex system of versification used in Old English, Old Norse, Old High German and Old Saxon heroic poetry. But generally, Anglo-Saxonists have moved away from the methodology of Klaeber and Chambers, both of whom made extensive comparisons between Beowulf and the sagas, thus placing the epic in a Baltic rather than a Mediterranean context. However, the structualist theory of Claude Lévi-Strauss gives new validity to the effort to view Beowulf as a work that, like the language and verse form in which it is composed, is inherently Germanic and only superficially Augustianian. To those interested in the recurrent narrative patterns that Jung would call "archetypal," Propp "functional," and Campbell "monomythic," a literary work presents the reader with an overt text-Beowulf the epic hero, who fights monsters to earn fame-and a covert text-Bee-wolf the shamanistic were-bear, who grapples with underworld spirits to gain power. The overt text is Old English, civilized, Christian; the covert text is Germanic, tribal, pagan. The overt text is the folktale plot line recorded by an Anglo-Saxon scribe; the covert text is the underlying structural pattern that gives surface form to plot and character. The theory that mythic literature in general uses the same archetypal patterns finds its strongest support in the structuralism of Lévi- Strauss, whose work in the discipline of anthropology, though mentioned in passing by Shippey (p. 3 note 11) and Jones (xvi), has not yet been systematically applied to an Old English work. Lévi-Strauss consistently emphasizes the universal structures that underlie individual events. In order to account for recurrent patterns in the social systems that evolve among discontinuous cultures, he tacitly applies the general principle that the human mind, like the human body, is structurally identical everywhere; therefore, people living in widely separated societies with no conceivable historical connection are predisposed by the very structure of the brain to develop culture complexes based on identical intellectual operations. However widely such complexes may vary as events, they are structurally the same-they are "a direct expression of the structure of the mind (and behind the mind, probably, of the brain), and not an inert product of the action of the environment on an amorphous consciousness" (1963:90). Constantly, Lévi-Strauss works "to discover, behind the chaos of rules and customs, a single structural scheme existing and operating in different spatial and temporal contexts" (1967:22). Shamanism offers us a case in point: although the word "shaman" is Tungusic and although the classic example of the shamanic culture complex is to be found among tribes living along the Amur River in far eastern Asia, the same complex has been attested among many other tribes widely separated in space and time. Tribal doctors applying shamanic techniques have been observed 34</page><page sequence="5">Glosecki: Wolf of the Bees not only in Asia, but also in the upper reaches of Northern Europe, in Africa, both Americas, Oceania and Australia. Therefore, we can consider shamanism to be a structure and its discrete manifestations as events. For a full definition of the culture complex, including wide-ranging examples, the reader is referred to Mircea Eliade's seminal work, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy, which gives some attention to the shamanic traits of early Germanic society (379-87 et passim). For now, we can define the shamans briefly as tribal doctors-typically healers, but potentially destroyers-who employ ecstasy to help their friends and harm their enemies. During trance, when their souls are said to range far beyond the body, they manipulate familiar spirits to accomplish the desired effect, benign or malignant. More often than not, shamans claim to assume the form of their guardian spirits during the metempsychotic journey; hence, as a general rule, to be a shaman is to be a shape-shifter. Since a confusing array of terms has been used to denote the shamanic guardian-familiar, tutelary spirit, animal companion, animal helper, animal guardian-I will henceforth use the Ojibwa term nigouimes , which means nothing other than "shamanistic animal guardian" (Lévi-Strauss, 1963:18). Among the Ojibwa as among most other shamanic tribes, the nigouimes is usually identified with an animal ranging in the tribal habitat. It is not uncommon for a doctor to claim more than one nigouimes, as among the Netsilik, where shamans (angatkoks) keep acquiring more of these mysterious allies (tunraqs) throughout their careers (Balikci 225). In the northern hemisphere, the most powerful, if not the most common, nigouimes is the bear. Arcane images of the bear link Beowulf to a shamanic tradition. Although the beast itself never fully materializes in the overt text of the poem, nonetheless it lurks between the lines, buried in the covert text, and its bulk gives the hero shape, strength, and size. Tribal bear lore exerted powerful influence upon the Beowulf legend in its formative stages; reflexes of this preliterary influence can still be seen in the poem passed on to us by an Anglo-Saxon who indulged an antiquarian interest as he reworked continental material for his insular audience. The link between Beowulf and the bear has long been common knowledge among Anglo-Saxonists;2 our immediate task is to account for this vague but vital connection. T. A. Shippev offers us a starting point in one of the more recent articles touching upon Beowulfs relation to the bear. In "The Fairy-Tale Structure of Beowulf," Shippey concerns himself mainly with the morphology of the poem but also makes some provocative remarks about the characterization of the hero. Two of these need some qualification. The first, having to do with the bear as perceived by tribal people, pertains to the epic as an Old English version of the widespread Bear's Son Tale: "To primitive peoples the bear is remarkable chiefly because it can hibernate, i.e., it appears to die and come to 35</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Ritual Studies 2/1 1988 life again" (11). As far as it goes, this statement is quite true: the bear's long sleep and dramatic reawakening- groggy, half-starved, proverbially irascible-must be impressive indeed to hunters who track this quarry knowing full well that the bear is the strongest, most dangerous game of all. And here a crucial point must be made: those tribes most impressed by the bear are also those most intimately associated with shamanism, as A. Irving Hallowell shows in Bear Ceremonialism in the Northern Hemisphere. A careful reading of Hallowell leads us inexorably toward a general rule that has significant implications in the context of Beowulf: among tribal peoples, bear cults do not appear in the absence of shamanism. Although the converse is not true at all-shamanism occurs widely outside the range of the bear-we can assume that evidence of a bear cult equals evidence of shamanism. And this is what the arcane bear imagery in Beowulf amounts to: evidence of a preliterary Germanic bear cult, which amounts to evidence of preliterary Germanic shamanism. Further, few ideas are more fundamental to this culture complex than the belief that the shaman has the power to die and return to life. Eliade dwells upon this point in his definitive work on the subject (33-66, 93-95). In initiation rites especially, falling into a state of ecstasy and later awakening from the trance is regularly viewed as a ritualistic death and rebirth which distinguishes the practitioners from their peers, just as the bear's sleeping and reawakening distinguishes it from other, more ordinary animals. With good reason, these two creatures, bear and shaman, often converge in the tribal mind; to some extent, their special powers are attributed to secret knowledge acquired during metempsychotic journeys to and from the realm of the dead, usually imagined as a shadowy underworld. So Shippey is quite right when he asserts that the bear's power "to die and come to life again" is very impressive to the tribal mind. And the real impact of this impression can best be accounted for in the context of shamanism. Therefore, his second remark, which directs readers of Beowulf away from the study of shamanism, is considerably less helpful than his first: "Of course the grave, thoughtful, dignified hero of the poem that we know bears little trace of the shaman" (11). On the contrary, the hero we know is subtly but indelibly marked by reflexes of Germanic shamanism, especially insofar as he displays notable ursine affinities. Furthermore, the implication that Beowulf s shamanic traits must compromise his dignity should be discarded, for in tribal culture shamans, however offensive their habits may appear to us, were usually venerable figures, respected doctors, true dignitaries, often quite thoughtful and grave, even though they may have muttered and frothed during fits of ecstasy. The fact that nowadays we are generally repulsed by shamanic practice attests to our extreme distance from, and concomitant misunderstanding of, the realities 36</page><page sequence="7">Glosecki: Wolf of the Bees of tribal life. In the eyes of their peers, shamans were sophisticated professionals, well-versed in the esoteric knowledge of the tribal elite, holding in their hands the power of life and death over friends and enemies.3 Shamans were priests of their people, who, like Beowulf, regularly met monsters in the course of their careers. Unlike the Beowulf whom we may know, but just like his hypothetical prototype in earlier versions of the Germanic Bear's Sort Tale , shamans themselves became like monsters, since they generally assumed animal form to attack enemies. Still, in the eyes of their own people, such conduct, strange as it may seem to us, was admirable, not reprehensible. Since they were typically shape-shifters, and since the bear is so widely associated with the shaman, it is ironic that Shippey should call Beowulf a "bear-hero" and yet deny the shamanistic overtones of such an epithet. For to call Beowulf a "bear-hero" is to recognized the shape-shifting propensities of this enigmatic character, who preserves vague nuances of preliterary Germanic myths, the details of which have long since been lost. Nor is it surprising that Beowulf should be associated with the bear, for this animal is so prone to being seen as a were-creature by the tribal beholder. And here Shippey's first remark falls short, because it emphasizes hibernation to the exclusion of an even more impressive ursine attribute: in northerly ranges removed from simian habitats, no other wild animal is so anthropomorphic. No other northern animal regularly rears up and walks like a human on two legs, nor sits down squarely on its haunches with its back resting comfortably against a tree. No other northern animal has the same "sagacious qualities, the omnivorous habits, and the wide range of facial and bodily expression of emotional behavior" (LaBudde 227). Further, "a bear, unlike other animals, walks on the sole of his foot with the heel touching the ground and leaves a footprint of heel, toe, and arch like that of a human being" (LaBudde 228). Finally, the bear has a wider than usual range of vocalization, including a Eeculiarly y hunters. human-sounding high-pitched whine, easily followed y hunters. There can be no doubt that the bear's anthropomorphic traits must have struck the tribal mind with a rich suggestive power at least as strong as that of the creature's annual reawakening in the spring. Such is the conclusion enforced by universal tales of were- bears in northern lands, where hunters for millennia have closely interacted with this animal, who generally has a shamanistic spirit power commensurate with its irresistible physical force. It is well known that Beowulf in action borrows something of the bear's great power, if only in his preferred method of combat-the bear-hug: I wouldn't bear a sword, a weapon against the dragon, if I knew how I might otherwise honorably come to grips with that monster, as I did with Grendel long ago ( 25 1 8b-252 1 )4 37</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Ritual Studies 2/1 1988 Not only does the hero here wish to dispatch the dragon with the same ursine grip that overcame Grendel, but, as he boasts a few lines before, it was this very battle-grip that burst the heart and bones of Daeghrefn, the Frisian champion: Not at all was he allowed to bring that treasure, that fabulous necklace, to the Frisian king, for the standard-bearer, the valiant nobleman, fell in the fight; nor was the sword his slayer, but rather the battle-grip smashed his throbbing heart, broke his bone-house (2503-2508a)5 Furthermore, like the bear in relation to other animals of the north, Beowulf is more massive than other men, as the coastguard exclaims the moment the Geats land (247b-249a). And he is much stronger, too, as Hrothgar points out when he hears of the hero's arrival (377-381a). But Beowulf also has a much less tangible association with the bear-a spiritual association all but lost for the modern reader. This spiritual dimension becomes clearer to us at our remove in time and culture if we look briefly at the bear lore of a few tribal societies observed in our own era. In the unavoidable absence of a common Germanic ethnography, we must satisfy ourselves with such obliquely illuminative evidence, drawn from the records of temperamentally similar cultures and applied to the long-gone society that contributed some fragments of its mythos to the Beowulf legend as we now know it. Among the Lapps and other Finno-Ugrian peoples of northern Eurasia, no other phase of social life involves more elaborate rituals nor more binding taboos than the culture complex built up around the bear hunt. Underlying reasons for this reverent ceremonialism affecting all members of the tribe may perhaps be implicit in the above discussion- the bear's uncanny hibernation, its striking anthropomorphism. Or the reason may lie in the huge amount of food afforded by a slaughtered bear; such a slaughter led to "eat-all" marathon feasts, both in Eurasia and North America. Or it may lie in the fact that before the invention of firearms, killing and dressing out a bear involved much teamwork and a genuine communal effort. In any case, the very number of noa names (euphemisms coined to prevent overt reference to the tabooed entity) accumulated by the bear demonstrates its awesome power in the minds of tribal hunters. Our own terms-bear, bruin-originate as noa names designating brown, the color of this creature of power. The Indo-European term, *rks- apparent in the root morpheme of "arctic" and in the Latin ursa-probably disappeared from Germanic long before the historical period, perhaps as a function of the very shamanism we are presently trying to trace. Precisely the same sort of displacement occurred among the Lapps, whose Finno-Ugrian term, guowža , was largely replaced by a North Germanic borrowing, bernu , at some point in the distant past 38</page><page sequence="9">Glosecki: Wolf of the Bees (Collinder 158). The very presence of this Scandinavian term, readily available for an ancient borrowing into Lappish, suggests a very early date for the loss of some form of *rks in favor of a Germanic noa name cognate with the New English bear. All by itself, this process of euphemistic displacement can hardly reflect anything other than a powerful taboo governing the bear; in turn, the presence of such a binding taboo shows that a bear cult must have existed among the primeval Germanic tribes. Moreover, it would be surprising to find that such compelling tribal attitudes could influence the Germanic lexicon without leaving their mark upon the literature, too. Among the many "safe" names for bear that could be assembled from northern traditions (e.g., "winter sleeper," "golden paw," "honey hand," "sticky mouth," "hairy one," "master of the forests," "owner of the earth," "god of the mountains," "chief," "elder," or, quite simply, "that's him"), one particular class stands out dramatically. This class comprises kinship terms like "beloved uncle," "elder brother," "chiefs son," "grandfather" and "grandmother" (Hallo well 43-50). These terms that address the bear as consanguineous kin imply, along with a totemie family tree, widespread traditions of shape-shifting colorfully illustrated by other elements of bear hunt rituals. In the Lapp camp after the kill, for instance, one hunter claimed the honor of tying the muzzle of the freshly slain bear to his own face in a ceremonial gesture obviously devised, for whatever more immediate reasons, to approximate the face of the man to the face of the bear. Along with the Lapps, the Voguls and Ostyaks of northwestern Siberia performed a dramatic reenactment of the successful hunt, wherein one hunter played the part of the bear, speaking its appropriate lines in dialogue with the other actors (Collinder 156-63). Constantly, the dead bear received its due respect. It was generally treated like a person during the hunt itself and, especially, in the course of the attendant ritual, which began in earnest with the actual killing of the bear and the hunters' formal apology for having been obliged to slay this grandfather figure in the best interests of the tribe. Also practiced by Asian tribes farther east, this apology to the slain creature of power calls to mind the bear lore of the Amerindians, which has some striking parallels with Finno-Ugrian and, hypothetically, preliterary Germanic tradition. In Northwest Coast culture, where the bear's role as the totemie ancestor of certain clans has in itself overtones of shape- shifting and hence, of shamanism, Grizzly-Bear Woman, a common totem pole crest, stands out as a clear example of the anthropomorphized bear (Frazer 3:293-94). Moreover, the totemie use of bear imagery among the Tlingit and Haida may suggest that for the early Germanic tribes too, the shape-shifting bear may have come about in myths of origin devised to account for the acquisition of the totem. 39</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Ritual Studies 2/1 1988 Grizzly-Bear Woman-mythically the wife of a grizzly and mother of his cubs-has a striking analogue in North Germanic literature, in which Bera ("She-Bear") of Hrólfs Saga Kraka marries Bjorn ("He-Bear") and has a son, Bjarki ("Little Bear"), the hero widely known as an analogue for Beowulf himself. As R. W. Chambers indicates in a summary of pertinent scholarship, Beowulfs own name means "Bee-wolf," which seems quite the most likely etymology among the other possibilities discussed and discounted by this notable scholar (365-69). Recently, in " Beowulf. The Mark of the Beast and the Balance of Frenzy," Thomas Pettitt has confirmed Chambers' opinion and also noted the important relationship between the were-bears in Hrólfs Saga and the hero of the Old English epic (528, 530). The same points also figure importantly in Arenťs essay (150). To go a step beyond Chambers, Pettitt and Arent, this metaphor, "Bee-wolf'-a kenning based on the bear's proverbial love of honey-may represent an actual Germanic noa name for this creature, comparable to the euphemisms noted by both Hallowell (50) and Chambers (366): "honey-eater" and "honey- paw." Apparently, Beowulfs name commemorates the fact that hungry bears must have been a real problem for early Germanic beekeepers, whose honey farming was a central concern among tribes so devoted to their mead that they devised charms to foster the production of this essential ingredient (Spamer). The hero we know as Beowulf, then, probably owes both his ursine name and bear-hug battle grip to a dim figure from a totemistic past-a primeval were-bear from a tribal tradition, a shamanistic shape-shifter, perhaps even the eponymous ancestor of a Germanic clan. So when the Angle-Saxon scribe-himself a Christian living in a culture no longer tribal, much less totemic-committed the Beowulf material to writing, he preserved for us, probably wholly unwittingly, some most intriguing ethnographic data. For this ancient Germanic ancestor figure, lurking behind the Beowulf we know, would have been a shape-shifter on the order of Grizzly-Bear Woman, who appears in the lore of various Northwest Coast tribes, and whose diffusion throughout the Coast culture area may be compared with the diffusion, and consequent diversification, of the Beowulf/Bjarki material in the preliterary Germanic world. The persistent legend of a full-blown were-bear family, which lasted long enough to find its way into Hrólfs Sagat a fourteenth-century source, reveals a primal notion that tne early Germanic peoples shared with other hunters of the north: humans and bears are bound in an uncanny union so close that it can only be described as a bond of genetic intimacy. Generally, such peoples do not distinguish sharply between individual and species. To them the solitary, concrete beast-formidable as it may be in all its bone-crushing force-immediately partakes of the much more awesome power of the universal set of bears, a vast abstraction, something on the order of deity. 40</page><page sequence="11">Glosecki: Wolf of the Bees In the tribal mind, the boundary between scientifically distinguishable species need not be sharp and clear as it is supposed to be in the mind of a modern zoologist. From tribe to tribe, different entities are grouped together in various ways to form elaborate constructs widely different from one another and downright alien to the eye of the modern observer. The range of variation from one system to the next is limited only by the range of human intellection. So to our way of thinking, the lines between the species in any given tribal system often come in strange places and intersect in surprising ways. Species wholly distinct in our system may converge within the tribal mind, which orders its reality according to principles quite different from those applied to modern science. Human and bear may merge. Their physical and spiritual identities may become inseparably bound up with one another. Therefore, the Northwest Coast Amerindians speak of their "Grizzly-Bear Grandmother," the Lapps address the hunted bear as "grandfather," the Beowulf poet praises a hero whose name means "bear," and the Icelandic saga writer celebrates the exploits of the offspring of a woman and a were-bear. This widespread tendency of tribal people to blur the lines between the species is the rationale underlying both shamanism and totemism. If we view the Old English epic apart from its reflexes of these archaic institutions, then we may catch a glimpse of the poem as perceived by the insular Anglo-Saxon scribe, but we draw a curtain over the rich body of traditional material imported by his ancestors from the Baltic shores of northern Europe. The most transparent version of the primeval Germanic were- bear is the berserkr , that ferocious shape-shifting warrior romanticized in the sagas. As the Oxford English Dictionary etymologizes it, the word berserk literally means "bear-coat;" most likely, the term reflects the belief that these shamanistic warriors really changed into bears when their fits of battle-franzy came on. As a shape-shifter who fought in a state of ecstasy, the berserkr is best understood in the context of shamanism, and the figure invites comparison with similar figures in other tribal societies, such as the wolf warriors of the Nootka or the Pawnee. Since berserkers were apparently thought to use both shape-shifting and ecstasy in combat, they should be considered shamanic, if not actual shamans. It is the conventional task of shamans to borrow the form of the nigouimes when they issue forth on metempsychotic journeys into the spirit realm to grapple with the supernatural enemies of the tribe-enemies who manifest themselves in the forms of disease, death, tempest, famine and other afflictions unavoidable in human life. Berserkers diverge from shamans mainly insofar as they are typically destroyers, whereas shamans are typically healers, whose ability to harm is secondary to their ability to cure. Further, berserkers fight flesh-and-blood enemies, whereas shamans fight spiritual enemies. Still, the ecstatic warrior in 41</page><page sequence="12">Journal of Ritual Studies 2/1 1988 bear form becomes a sort of secular shaman, whose mission is to destroy the physical rather than the spiritual enemies of the tribe. It is beside the point whether we choose to regard shamanic shape-shifting as delusion, fantasy, hysteria, psychosis, or more astutely, as a symbol of doctors' powers over their peers. For in tribal societies in which the shaman's power has been known both to kill and to cure, shape-shifting ability is simply accepted as something given, a tool of the doctor's trade. So shape-shifting and shamanism are virtually inseparable. One presupposes the other. Therefore, to recognize Beowulfs shape-shifting tendency by pointing out his vague connection with the bear is, in effect, to recognize his affinity with shamanism. The most compelling example of a shamanic warrior in the entire Germanic corpus is the aforementioned Bothvar Bjarki ("War-wolf Little Bear" Pettitt:530), son of a were-bear, who nghts for King Hrólf in the Scylding dynasty's last stand at Leyre. As the story goes in Hrólfs Saga , Bjarki, alone in the royal hall, falls into a deep trance while the battle rages outside. During his trance, a huge bear appears in the van of Hrólfs army, devastating the Danes' enemies. But when Bjarki is forcibly awakened, the bear ally disappears at once, and the Danes soon utterly lose the battle. Bjarki in his trance should be seen as a warrior shaman in ecstasy, sending forth his bear spirit- his nigouimes- hoping to save his tribe. In the attacking army is Queen Skuld, who is seated on her sorceress' scaffold (a construction mainly associated with the seithr), and who becomes Bjarki's evil genius and rival shaman. Having waited until the disappearance of Bjarki's nigouimes , her only viable foe, she sends forth her own nigouimes in the form of a monstrous boar that seals the fate of Hrólf and his men. Bjarki, who figures in other sources besides Hrólfs Sagat has long been recognized as a direct analogue for Beowulf himself.6 The link between these two heroes is probably genetic. If we could trace them back through oral versions of their stories, thev would most likely fall together into the same distant prototype. Äs E. V. Gordon suggests in his Introduction to Old Norse , "It is probably the same story differentiated during centuries of independent transmission in different lands" (26). If both heroes descend from a mythic warrior-shaman, perhaps the eponymous ancestor of a bear clan, then this lineage would account for the overtones of shape-shifting implicit in Beowulfs name as well as in his remarkable habit of using the bear-hug in combat. Another subtle but significant link between Hrólfs Saga and Beowulf can be seen in the comparable use of boar imagery in both sources. In the former the boar is the nigouimes of two powerful characters, Athils and Skuld, enemies of Hrólf, both well-versed in sorcery. In the latter, images of the boar, appearing six times on battle gear, clearly have apotropaic power, twice emphasized by 42</page><page sequence="13">Glosecki: Wolf of the Bees the poet-first when the Geats arrive in Denmark and second when Beowulf girds himself for his plunge to the bottom of the sea. Boar images shone over cheek-guards, adorned with gold, glinting and fïre-hardened- it held the life-watch, the war-minded one for the fierce ones (303b-306a). But that gleaming helmet protected his head, the one that had to stir up the floor of the mere, to seek out the water-mingling, adorned with treasure, wound round with lordly bands; thus the weapon-smith wrought it in far-off days, formed it wonderfully, set round with swine-shapes, so that thereafter no sword nor battle-mace might bite into it(1448-54).7 The protective power so apparent in these passages must be implicit in the other references to the boar in Beowulf. One of these, in which eoforas ("boars") appears in variation with fethan ("foot soldiers"), suggests that boars and warriors-like the bear nigouimes and Bjarki-are interchangeable: ... in battle we protected the point, when foot soldiers clashed, boars struck together ( 1 326b-28a ).8 Like eoferas, several other poetic terms for "warrior" also suggest that certain aggressive animals were once seen as shamanic guardians for men in battle: beorn , "bear"; freca, "wolf"; waelwulf "slaughter-wolf"; heoruwulf "sword-wolf." As Arent notes, these Old English terms for "bear warrior" and "wolf warrior" stem from the same shamanic tradition as the Old Norse terms berserkir and úlfethnar (150-51). The same origin probably accounts for the intriguing relationship between the Old English and Old Norse cognates eofor , "boar," and jofurr , "prince." One term designates an animal, the other a man. The theriomorphic transformations implied here, though reduced to fantasy in our own society, are often credited by tribal people. The shamanic implications of such animal imagery gather force when considered in light of artifacts like the widely published sixth-century Torslunda dies, one of which depicts a shape-shifter in the form of a wolf. (See Plate 1). This same shamanism is also suggested by the "man-between-monsters" motif-formerly, and, to my mind, erroneously known as the "Daniel in the Lion's Den" motif-found on another Torslunda die in Norse metalwork and woodcarving, and most dramatically in the context of Old English literature: upon the Sutton Hoo purse- top. (See Plate 2). These so-called whispering beasts seem to be graphic representations of the nigouimes , either initiating or 43</page><page sequence="14">PLATE 1 The Franks Casket : Detail , Side Panel After Branston 11.

If we attempt to arrive at the original motive underlying the bracketing-beast motif so widespread in Germanic art, and especially if we place the motif alongside Odin and his famous familiars, the two ravens Hugin "Thought" and Munin "Memory" symmetrically perched on either shoulder of the shaman-god, whispering their wisdom in either ear, then the shamanic interpretation of the Germanic man- between-monsters design becomes irresistible. Here, too, might be mentioned that inscrutable figure on a side panel of the Franks Casket: a shape-shifter seated in state, holding regalia, with a goosehead protruding from his forehead (See Plate 3). Could this seventh-century carving represent vague Northumbrian memories of continental shamanic lore? Puzzling indeed is the ubiquitous animal imagery of early Germanic art, which, if rooted in the preoccupations of a shamanic society, suggests that this tribal institution was so widespread before the migrations that we should expect some vestige of it to surface in Beowulf But of all shamanic motifs in Germanic sources the most important is the seithr , which figures often enough in different sagas to suggest that the ritual was a genuine Icelandic practice that persisted illegally after the Christianization of the island in the eleventh century. When a practice like the seithr is described in detail by a number of different saga writers who seem tacitly to accept it as a fact of early Icelandic life, then it is likely that the ritual did not simply arise as an imaginative convention in a rich literary tradition. This ritual, shamanic both in form and motive, could hardly have materialized in an artistic vacuum unrelated to genuine culture traits. In the seithr , the seer mounts a raised platform surrounded by singers, whose rhythmic chanting induces ecstasy. It is impossible to say how many different things the shaman may have hoped to accomplish in this trance-the sagas show that it is used mainly to predict the future and cast evil spells on enemies. The most graphic description of the ritual appears in Eiriks Saga Rautha , in which sorceress Thorbjorg conducts a seithr remarkable for its minute detail. Such close description strongly suggests that shamanic ritual persisted into the Christian era in Iceland, at least, for minutiae like Thorbjorg's catskin-lined gloves seem to represent contemporary observations of flesh-and-blood shamans, and not simply the inventions of an imaginative thirteenth-century author. Such accumulation of detail in a genre known for its sparseness of description suggests that the saga writers saw or heard of the traditional regalia of North Germanic shamans. Vestiges of shamanism probably persisted into the Christian era in England as the Sutton Hoo purse-top, the Franks Casket shape-shifter and the ursine attributes of Beowulf indicate. And 46</page><page sequence="17">PLATE 3 The Torslunda Dies After Bruce-Mitfold, Aspects, Plates 57-59. These figures first appeared in The Mankind Quarterly (Glosecki, "Men Among Monsters" 209). Glosecki: Wolf of the Bees 47</page><page sequence="18">Journal of Ritual Studies 2/1 1988 at least one of the metrical charms utilizes a shamanic motive. With Faerstice preserves a cryptic remedy for elfshot- an affliction based on the belief that invisible enemies (elves, ¿Esir, or witches, according to the charm) can shoot unseen darts into people, with diasastrous effects. Patently, elfshot is the Germanic version of the familiar shamanic weapon of "pointing the bone" or "shooting" disease. With Faerstice- strictly speaking, is a counter-charm designed to neutralize the sorcery of a disease-shooter. This shows that West Germanic doctors at some point were shamanic, and that the literate Anglo-Saxons preserved vestiges of this primeval shamanism in traditional remedies fixed in psychoactive verses and probably elsewhere too-in non-verbal culture traits effaced by the passage of time. If shamanism figures in one part of the Old English corpus- the charms-then why not in Beowulf? Moreover, in marked contrast to Augustinián interpretations of the poem, one may find a striking typological correspondence between Beowulf s descent into the sea and the typical shaman's descent into the underworld, that dim subconscious realm of spirits and symbols, where, while the body falls into ecstasy, the psyche does battle with the supernatural enemies of the tribe. The Augustinián approach explains this episode as an allegory for the apocryphal harrowing of hell (e.g., Cabaniss). But this is one possibility only, for Beowulfs dreamlike journey and dangerous combat with "alien spirits" ( ellorgaestas ) correspond in tone and temper with the shaman's psychic descent and infernal struggle against the strong but intangible spirits of disease. If one accepts descent into earth or water as an archetype for descent into depths of mind, then Beowulf has pronounced affinities with the shaman, aside from those inherent in his name and his preferred method of combat (the bear-hug). Furthermore, since Davidson asserts that Odin's traditional descent into the underworld is shamanic, the same can be said for Beowulfs own plunge down to the eerie hall on the floor of the sea. So Beowulfs downward journey may preserve another reflex of Germanic shamanism in the Old English version of the bear- hero story. Along with his ursine style of combat, Beowulfs extraordinary size and preternatural strength also suggests a close connection with the bear, a creature of power that, in turn, is the focal point of circumpolar shamanic ritual. His ultimate origin in a shamanic warrior cult- probably continental and prehistoric-is implicit in his very name, Wolf of the Bees, which, as shown above, may have originated as a noa name coined to prevent the breaking of a strong taboo that restricted interaction with the bear. This shamanic connection seems stronger still when we juxtapose the Old English bear hero with his literary cousin, the Old Norse berserkr , and with the animal art on the Torslunda dies, the Sutton Hoo purse-top, and the Franks Casket. And the link grows stronger too when we consider the boar's role as nigouimes in Beowulf and Hrólfs Saga. Also, poetic terms for warrior, such as beorn and freca , with their animal referents and 48</page><page sequence="19">Glosecki: Wolf of the Bees theriomorphic implications, suggest that shamanic guardians were once commonplace among the aggressive Germanic tribes. Therefore, in view of these widely dispersed reflexes of Germanic shamanism-and of shamanic ritual's apparent persistence into the Middle Ages in Iceland and, perhaps, vestigially, in England too- I feel misled by strict Augustinián readings of the epic, and also by the remark that Beowulf "bears little trace of the shaman." Though arcane, and in many ways alien to mainstream Western culture, vestiges of shamanism probably had considerable impact upon the characterization of the Old English bear hero. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Dr. Glosecki is Assistant Professor of Old English Literature at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Aside from the Mankind Quarterly articles listed below, he has published " Beowulf 769: Grendel's Ale-Share" in English Language Notes 25.1 (September 1987). Presently, he is revising Shamanism and Beowulf : Back to the Tribes , scheduled to appear as Volume 3 in The Albert Bates Lord Studies in Oral Tradition , published by Garland. 49</page><page sequence="20">Journal of Ritual Studies 2/1 1988 NOTES lShetelig gives a fairly detailed etymology of the name Odin (415-16). His name (ON. Odinn , OE. and OS. Wóden , Langovardic Wódany OHG. Wuotan) is a derivative of the adjective ON. odry OE. wõdy Gothic wódsy OHG. wuoty ''possessed, frantic," and is also related to Latin vates , "seer, prophet, god-possessed singer." The name referred originally, therefore, to that ecstatic condition which in every age has been regarded as the effect of a supernatural force giving the person possessed by it a supernatural power; this is well known in the Greek oracles, the Siberian shaman and the Indian medicine-men. For a fuller discussion of this etymology, see Opland (29-32 ). 2Both Klaeber (xxv) and Chambers (365-81), drawing upon Panzer's seminal work on the subject, treat Beowulf s relation to the Bears Son Tale in some detail. " More recently, Thomas Pettitt has discussed Beowulfs affinity with the bear in " Beowulf : The Mark of the Beast and the Balance of Frenzy." A. M. Arent and T. A. Shippey also treat this central topic. Rhys Carpenter argues that the Bears Son Tale also influenced The Odyssey. ^Although some are inclined to view the shaman as a demented psychotic, Eliade cogently argues against this ethnocentric impression (23-32). Several anthropologists show that the shaman is typically a high-ranking member of the tribe, feared by most, respected by all. For instance, Asen Balikci writes that "the shaman, or angatkoky occupied an important position in Netsilik society. Although in daily life he behaved like an ordinary hunter, he was generally respected and feared for his supernatural powers" (225). Similarly, in regard to the Jívaro, Michael Harner writes that the shaman acquires "wealth and social influence" mainly because other tribesmen "court his favor in order to assure themselves of his future willingness to cure them" (117). Robert H. Lowie emphasizes the fact that "radically different notions as to eminence occur in other parts of the world," going on to say that in Maidu society, for example, "there is an elective chieftaincy based on wealth and generosity, but in reality the shaman, especially if leader of the secret society, completely overshadowed the headman" (342). One might also consult Kwakiutl Ethnography by Franz Boas for further examples of the shaman's prestige in tribal society. 4Klaeber (1950:95). Subsequent passages from Beowulf are also drawn from this edition of the poem. Pettitt also treats the ideas discussed in this paragraph and quotes the excerpts reproduced here: Nolde ic sweord beran, waepen to wyrme, gif ic wiste hu with tham aglaecean elles meahte gylpe withgripam. swa ic gio with Grendle dyde. 5In Old English it reads: Nalles he tha fraetwe Frescyninge, breostweorthunge bringan moste, ac in campe gecrong cumbles hyrde, aetheling on eine; ne waes ecg bona, ac him hildegrap heortan wylmas, banhus gebraec. 6Other Icelandic works mentioning Bjarki are the fragmentary Bjarkamály Saxo's Gesta Danorumy the late medieval Bjarkarimury Snorri's Edda ( Skáldskaparmály Chapters 53-54), the lost Skoldunga Saga (summarized by Arngrim Jónsson in 1594), and the Series Runica Regum Daniae Alterum. My sources for this information are the works cited by Garmonsway and Gordon. My discussion of Bjarki's performance at Leyre echoes a short passage in an earlier article on the archaeological evidence of early Germanic shamanism (Glosecki "Wolf Dancers" 314). 50</page><page sequence="21">Glosecki: Wolf of the Bees REFERENCES Allen, Richard F. 1971.
