<plain_text><page sequence="1">Parasitic Copepoda from Louisiana Fresh Water Fish David Causey University of Arkansas, Fayetteville No truly monographic survey of the parasitic Copepoda of American freshwater fish has been made. Wilson, in his numerous papers surveying taxonomic groups, necessarily included freshwater species. In two papers (Wilson, 1914 and 1917) he dealt with freshwater forms exclusively. Numer- ous papers and bulletins on the parasites of freshwater fish mention copepods, usually rather incidentalIy. Argulus sp. and Ergasilus caeruleus appear to be the most widespread species in such literature. The present report is based upon material from Louisiana freshwater fish collected during 1955 and kindly sent to me by Dr. Harry J. Bennett of Louisiana State University. There were 49 collections in which parasitic copepods had been observed. In a few cases the actual parasites had been separated in vials while in the rest the collections were either pieces of flesh from which lernaeids hung, or gills upon which there were ergasilids. I failed to find parasites in five samples, neither on the gills nor in the slime and detritus in the bottom of the containers. These probably had ergasilids on them which had become lost or were overlooked. They were from fish well represented by other specimens in this survey. It is my understanding that this material came from the fish recognized to be parasitized with copepods. I have no information which would allow any speculation as to the possible incidence of infection. Five years of experience with Gulf of Mexico copepod parasites lead me to think, considering the difficulties of fair sampling, age factors, life history factors, etc., that statements of incidence of infection for copepodcs have little value. Four genera and 12 species are represented in the collection. Of these, Argulus is the textbook parasitic copepod, readily recognized by its flat, scale- like body and the two ventral suckers. It occurs on the body surface of the fish, where it moves about readily. It has a tendency to let go as the fish is lifted from the water, so that many specimens are lost in this way. It is some- times found swimming freely in the water. The female leaves the host fish to lay her eggs on some submerged object. Because of this habit it lacks the two egg sacs so typicaI of copepods. Lernaea is also found on the surface, usually back of a fin, with its anchor-like anterior end deeply embedded in the hosts flesh. L. cyprinacea ( = L. carassii Tidd) is regularly referred to as the "anchor parasite" in texts on fisheries, but I think fishermen who have noticed them refer to the whole genus as "anchor worms." The members of the genus Ergasilus are minute gill parasites. Occasionally only a few are present, but they may be so numerous as to suggest that the gills have been peppered. A little magnification will show the second antennae, a pair of vicious appearing claws, clasping the gill filament, either at the very end of the filament or hig,her up. The last of the four genera, Achtheres, could be confused with Salmincola by a determined individual, but the absence of an 378</page><page sequence="2">0 .0 0 8 .0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t 0 0 VS C4 0- eil 5. &gt; 0 ? u O &gt; -.- O 0 W O ., 0 u u u 0- 4-4 : : 0 go 0 0 .- :3 0 &gt; u 0 0 '41 14-4 U4 (Z ;4 &gt;E ;4 O m 4u, O W 0 41 0 J--l U W 0 3-1 a OB ti-- 0 0 = W 0 0 0 O O - -0 u 4) V. 4) 0 &gt;. .-.- Q 0;-a ;4 1-4 -V &gt; &gt; g g (14 g 4-i ;4 41. 0 :,=I 0 V. u 0 biD CIJ C6C6 Q$ C,, 0 C'S u -S4 z I 0 CZ cj %S 0 .41 W 0 WE 4) (A (A C's m o 'A D 44 1-4 U W 1-4 0 0 Z U 2 U Z 0 04 4\ 04 u W :3 Zs oz 0 Zs oz 14-4 4' Q4_ t,,3- 0 23 PQ -.!! &gt; - -.2 W , k) r.!

Since Salminco1a is associated with trout and salmon, it is unlikely that it will turn up in Louisiana fish. Achtheres, like some other genera of parasitic copepods, tempts one into anthropomorphism. The body is rather human- like, and the two arms clasping the bulla suggest a prayerful attitude far from the actual truth! These occur on the gills or the gill arches and are large enough to be seen easily with the naked eye. With the exception of the textbook Argulus, which lives on mucus, all these copepods (including the real Argulus!) are blood sucking parasites. It is difficult to assess the damage done.

Probably a lernaeid, with its anterior end deeply embedded in the flesh (often causing a tumor-like mass), does the most damage per parasite. Whether the one, two, or three I have found present on a fish in these samples are worse than the ergasilids, running up to possibly several hundred, must be left as a matter of personal opinion. With fish in their natural waters copepods probably take Only a minor toll. In fish hatcheries and fish ponds an entirely different set of environmental factors may apply, e.g., crowding, unnatural food, etc. Then any of these parasites may become a serious factor. This is well known for the lernaeids. Data regarding the species, their hosts, and the localities from which they were obtained are presented in ta'ble 1. Keys to the genera and species are also provided. The key to the genera, using admittedly superficial characteristics, will allow the determination of the genera considered in this report. To deter- mine the species requires the working out of details with considerable care, and, of course, access to the literature. The task is made more difficult, especially in argulids and liernaeids, by a lamentable lack of agreement among the spe- cialists as to which species are valid, and what characteristics are pertinent. The keys included will allow a reasonable approximation of the species in- cluded in this report if used for mature females with well developed egg sacs. The best a key for most of the parasitic Copepoda can do is to narrow the probability to a limited number of possible species. Then the actual details must be established. If this is done first, one doesn't need a key!

The species of Ergasilus are the most widely distributed and numerous of the parasitic copepods in these fish. Of these E. versicolor is the most prevalent. Ictalurus furcactus, the blue cat, is host to the most species of parasitic copepods among the fish examined, one from each of the four parasitic genera found. The various bass are next; Micropterus punctulatus, the Kentucky bass, and M. salmoides, the largemouth bass, with three species each. No marked host specificity is evident. Ergasilus versicolor appeared in 8 different species of fish, while Lernaea anumala and L. cruciata were in three different species respectively. REFERENCES HARDING, J.
