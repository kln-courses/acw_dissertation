<plain_text><page sequence="1">?PA P?TA (Q?MIS COMMENTARIES NO. 2) By A. D. H. BiVAR In a recent issue of this journal1 the writer essayed a reading of the fragmentary Parthian ostracon from the 1967 excavations by John Hansman and D. B. Stronach at Shahr-i Q?mis, near D?mgh?n, Iran. The tentative reading in line 4 was as follows: 4 ]myk:'pp('t) The round brackets at this point indicate the editor's hesitation between similar letter-forms, rather than actual defacement of the lettering. So far as they go, the traces are reasonably clear. Lack of context, the fragmentary state of the specimen, and the frequently ambivalent nature of this script, made it seem premature at that stage to pursue an etymological justification of the reading. After the article had appeared, however, Dr. D. N. MacKenzie kindly gave his support for the general feasibility of the readings in this line, and further drew attention to a fact that the writer had at first overlooked, that the spelling -p't would represent an entirely normal, scriptio plena orthography for the Old Persian element -p?ta "protected (by)". This is an element of common occurrence in Old Persian theophoric personal names. In the texts of the Parthian ostraca from Nisa, the tendency to scriptio plena spellings is relatively common. (These are the spellings in which an additional consonant, known to the grammarians as the mater lectionis, is introduced into the consonantal spelling to indicate the quality of a long vowel, which in the older spelling would have remained un represented in the script). This development became increasingly common in all branches of the Aramaic writing-system from the second century b.c., and appears also in the spelling of Parthian, where the Aramaic words are no more than an ideographic device to convey the underlying Iranian dialect Since this view of the language runs to some extent counter to the position taken by the writer in his earlier article, it will be necessary to return to it in the paragraph which follows. So far as the spelling-convention is concerned, it will be seen that the name Tir, that both of a deity and of male persons, is spelt in the first century-B.c. documents from Nisa in the longer form Tyry,2 whilst the earlier evidence of the Achaemenid period attests the spelling Try.3 At the same time, scriptio plena is not invariable 1 A. D. H. Bivar, "The first Parthian ostracon from Iran", JRAS, 1970, 65. That article is treated as the first of the series to be sub-titled "Q?mis commentaries", and it is hoped that other short notes will follow in due course on topics of interest emerging from the finds of these excavations. I am grateful to Professor Mary Boyce, and Professor Martin Schwartz, who each read this note in an earlier draft, and made helpful criticisms, though neither, of course, necessarily endorses the final version. * I.

The reading is to be upheld, pace Professor H. S. Nyberg ("An Old Persian name on a silver bowl in Dr. Kempe's collection", Festskrift Carl Kempe, 753), who, in throwing doubt on the possible existence of that form, did not, it seems, notice tha? it is already attested in the Kharosth? spelling Tiravharna, as is indeed noted in a footnote elsewhere in the earlier article.</page><page sequence="2">120 ?PAP?TA (Q?MIS COMMENTARIES NO. 2) at Nisa, where the documents also attest the scriptio defectiva Wrtrgnpt (Varhraynb?t) "Protected by Varathraghna", a word in which the final syllable is etymologically identical with that which concerns us now. Thus although at Nisa there prevailed a certain latitude in regard to this spelling convention, and the older short spellings tended to linger on, even in some cases as late as the Sasanian period, yet for our ostracon the interpretation -p?ta is evidently valid. Here it is necessary to return for a moment to the point made in the previous paragraph, that the underlying language of the Parthian ostraca from Nisa is indeed Iranian rather than Aramaic. In the context of these particular texts the distinction is in some respects a narrow one, since the evidence of Iranian syntax which they contain is minimal. In his earlier article, however, the writer was influenced by Professor Sznycer's argument4 that the language of the Nisa ostraca, at that early stage, could even be taken as syntactically acceptable Aramaic. That they can be understood with almost complete accuracy by a reader familiar with Aramaic goes without saying; but longer study of the material presented by Diakonov and Livshits,5 and in particular the document no. 1760 recently discussed by Mile Chaumont6 with its decisive formula BRY AH Y BRY, now persuades the writer that they cannot be treated as fully compatible with the rules of Aramaic grammar, and that their Iranian aspect must be duly stressed. Such forms as HN'Lt and HN'LW, whatever their formal explanation, must in the light of this evidence be regarded as foreshadowing the charac teristic verbal ideograms of later Pahlavi, as of course Diakonov and Livshits had long claimed. In view of the lively discussion still current as to the fundamental language of these texts, it seemed necessary to restate here the writer's position, though the Q?mis ostracon does not bear directly on the matter. Yet whichever view is taken of this somewhat academic question, the usefulness of Professor Sznycer's articles as an introduction to the Nisa texts for the Western reader is of course in no way impaired. The second element of the word in question having been discussed, it remains to consider the first. A certain temptation exists to emend the printed reading to *spJt, which would allow a possible transcription *Asa-p?ta "protected by horses (cavalry?)". Yet it seems clear that such an emendation should be resisted. We shall now consider the parallels which suggest that names formed with the second element -pata were usually theophoric, so that an initial element is required which would also represent the name of a deity. The defectiva spelling Wrtrgnpt already considered shows a similar name compounded with that of the deity Varathraghna. Several other examples are known in Greek and other non consonantal scripts, somewhat inconveniently for our purpose since the Aramaic spellings cannot be directly established. Opposite these compounds in the left-hand column, we set in the centre column the similar series of theophoric names which terminate in -yn (-en), some of which were noted in the earlier article,7 and in the right-hand column the further theophoric series compounded with -bwzn (??ovCavrjc). 4 M.

A number of the forms listed here raise minor problems, which must now be noticed, but these do not seem to impair the general validity of the paradigm. If Tiypairarj)$ be here regarded as a compound with the name of the god Tir, the presence of gamma in the Greek spelling seems an anomalous feature. Similar spelling is found in the name of the newly-discovered Susa chief Tiypa?os,10 who must now be set against the well-known Tipa?os of Characene. We may also consider here the Armenian Tigranes, as against the similar form Tiran, but whether these variations arise from differences of derivation rather than of etymology cannot be investigated here. Of the names included in the foregoing list we comment now only on details supplementary to the information given in F. Justi, Iranisches Namenbuch. Mai?ovlavr)s known to Justi from a Greek inscription of Anatolia, recently appeared in its Aramaic spelling Mhybwzn on a seal-impression from Dascylium.11 In forms such as ZaOpo?oviam^c we may reasonably see the Old Persian xsathra- "kingdom" employed in theophoric compounds to represent a veritable deity, the Am?raspand whose Avestan designation was Khshathra Vairya, eponym of the Zoroastrian month Shahrevar; and whose frankly anthropomorphic image appears, in the idiom ofthat age, on the reverses of Kushan gold coins. It may be worth considering whether the M?zandar?ni name Shah riy?r ought not to be explained, on similar lines to Isfandiy?r, as a theophoric -data compound. To return to our immediate topic, Dr. Gershevitch has seen in the Elamite spelling APPUZANA a rendering of an Old Persian compound of ap- "water" -+- -?ovCdvrjc.1* The exact interpretation of the latter element has given rise to some discussion13 not relevant Best attested from the spelling in local script upon the coins of Lycia, for which recent references will be found in N.

Parallel to both is the now well attested form ?ben, spelt in Parthian script *pyn,u and in Pahlavi 'pyny,15 which is analogous to other typically Parthian theophoric names such as Mihren, M?hen and Tiren. It seems therefore that the initial element ?p- "Water" is entirely in place, equally with the names of the principal Iranian divinities, in theophoric names of familiar type. That the Iranians of Achaemenid times offered sacrifice to water, no less than to sun and moon, earth, fire, and the winds, is of course asserted by Herodotus;16 and the ritual and meaning of this offering to the waters as it is still practised by the Zoroastrians of Iran were recently described by Professor Mary Boyce.17 We are not here concerned to explain the origins of the association which arose in the Zoroastrian religion between the religious concept of the Waters, conceived as a natural force, and that of the divinity An?hit? "the Undefiled (One)", envisaged as a female deity in human form, the Zoroastrian Venus. That such a connexion was felt to exist, at least in the post-Achaemenid period, is evident at several points in Professor Boyce's description.18 The ?b?n Yasht, dedicated to the Spirit of the Waters, is largely concerned with the praise of the anthropomorphic An?hit?,19 and lays an important emphasis on her military aspect, a concept of the deity which can hardly have arisen in the first place from a cult of water as one of the forces of nature. We shall have more to say shortly on the subject of the military An?hit?. By the Sasanian period, in any event, the personalities of ?b?n, the spirit of the Waters, and of An?hit? envisaged as an anthropo morphic Venus had virtually coalesced. This is shown by the fact that the gem at the Hague, already noticed,20 bears two personal names compounded with the element ?p- "water", and is moreover engraved with the subject of a standing female figure holding a dove in her hands, and evidently intended to represent the anthropomorphic An?hit?, with an evident allusion to the iconography of the classical Venus. The association is even more explicitly indicated by the sculptured investiture relief of Khusru II (a.D. 590-628) at T?q-i Bust?n near Kirm?nsh?h in Iran.21 Behind the central figure of the ruler stands a sumptuously dressed female figure whose identification as the goddess An?hit? is scarcely to be doubted. She holds up in her right hand a diadem towards the monarch. He at the same time receives a second from the male personage, who presumably represents the deity Ahuramazda, and stands on the spectator's right.22 One may surmise that the two diadems represent the 14 H.

With her left hand, in evident reference to her relation to the spirit of the waters, the goddess pours water from a jug, whilst all around water flows down from springs in the mountain to fill the sacred pool at which, in the Sasanian period, the offering of the db-zohr would most properly have been made. Whilst An?hit? thus in the Sasanian period manifestly personified the deity of the Waters, one need hardly doubt that in the Parthia of the 1st century B.c. also, the element ?p- in the conventionally theophoric personal names was understood as synonymous with that of the goddess An?hit?; and may indeed have been the preferred designation ofthat deity as the initial element of a compound, since the shorter forms were preferred in this position. A query may perhaps remain as to whether a name of the goddess would appropriately figure in the nomenclature of a male personage. For it must be supposed that the person named in our ostracon was male. But in the Aban Yasht kings and heroes sacrifice to the goddess for her aid; and since Professor Boyce has pointed out23 Zoroastrian texts which show that it was the practice of soldiers to make an offering to the spirit of the Waters "on the eve of battle, as part of the sacred ceremonial of war" at the nearest source of water, even a warrior might be held in a specific sense to be "protected by the waters" and indeed other similar compounds, such as Aben quoted above, occur regularly as the names of males. Naturally the goddess was also appropriately the patroness of females, and the best known such compound is probably that of the Iranian wife of Seleucus, Apama (Gk? Anapa), although exactly how this name should be analysed remains problematic.24 There seems no difficulty, however, in regarding many o? the ?p- compounds as the names of males, and this of course applies effectively to our proposed ?pap?ta. To sum up, the foregoing discussion seems to provide adequate justification for the reading 'pp't proposed in 197(1 At the same time, the Q?mss reading provides useful support for the explanation given by Dr. Gershevitch of the Elam?te APPUZANA. The light thrown by these readings on the process of name-formation amongst the Parthians, with its sources deeply rooted in the fabric of Zoroastrian belief, is a decidedly pleasing one. Even so small a fragment as this single ostracon has its contribution to make to the general picture that is being reconstructed of ancient Iran. A note must here be added concerning the oblique stroke which follows each of the names occurring in the document. Since this was quite unlike the vertical strokes which, in ** "?tajf-zohr and ?b-zohry\ p. 116 (The ritual concerned is part of the celebration of the yasna, the Zoroastrian equivalent, as it were, of the Christian mass.) " Perhaps it is possible to explain the Greek as a rendering of Iranian *?p?mm?h, deriving from the month name ?p?n-m?h-; or (on the lines of Justi's explanation of Spitama, Iranisches Namenbuch, 309. as a hypochoristic of Spitamenes) as a shortened form from a hypothetical *Apa- 4- manah. Though the somewhat similar form Mtvpapavo is now attested in Bactrian from Surkh Ko?a?, that form seems hardly to be regarded as a straightforward theophoric compound in view of the fact that mithra has also the meaning "friend", so that a similar formation with Ap- seems scarcely plausible. This is perhaps an argument against the second hypothesis. Against the first, it must be admitted that the proper-name formation of the "noun 4- adjective" type (e.g. ArS?ma, A. H. M. Stonecipher, Graeco-Persian Names, 22 and R. G. Kent, Old Persian, 171) would be more typical of the Achaemenid period than such later use of month-names as Mihrm?h and Farvardinm?h. ?RAS, 1972, 2. 10</page><page sequence="6">124 APA PATA (Q?MIS COMMENTARIES NO. 2) the Nisa ostraca, indicate numerals, the view was taken in the previous article that it represented a mark of punctuation. It will be observed, however, that in certain slightly later Parthian documents, numerals are indeed represented by an oblique stroke, with which, in the case of plural numbers, further slanting lines converge. This arrangement is found not only in the examples from Dura,25 but also in the well-known case of the Avroman parch ment.26 Our present ostracon illustrates the feature in only three places. In the second and fifth lines there is only a single oblique stroke, which does not make the numerical nature of the mark wholly clear. However, in the difficult third line a second, converging stroke appears to be present. If this is correctly seen, the combination must be read as the digit 2, and in the other cases the oblique stroke should represent the digit 1. The modification does not add greatly to our comprehension of the document, but suggests that it consists of a list of personal names followed by numerals, and is likely to represent a ration-list, a pay-roll, or a tax-assessment. 11 Richard N.
