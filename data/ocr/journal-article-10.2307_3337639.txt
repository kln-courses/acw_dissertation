Universitits- verlag Freiburg Schweiz, Freiburg, 1996. 280 pp., 30 color photos, 5 diagrams, 5 tables, map, bibliog- raphy. S.Fr. 65 softcover. Reviewed by Z. S. Strother A key ambition of Laurel Birch de Aguilar's new book, Inscribing the Mask, is to re-inscribe masquerade as religious experience among the Chewa of Malawi. She argues that analyses of politics, economics, gender, and psychology in masquerading have "fail[ed] to reach beyond one kind of interpretation into a broader understanding of the phenomena of masks and masking" (p. 231). From the beginning she emphasizes that masks from the Nyau society "are invested with a sense of dread," or opsya (p. 15), such that "the very word 'Nyau' makes some people catch their breath and step back. People have said it causes the skin to tighten and the hairs to stand up" (p. 41). The author believes that an absence of experiences of "rit- ual dread" in the Western secular world has led to an inability to represent the emotional essence of Nyau masquerading (pp. 230-31).1 The text sometimes slips from the topic of Chewa masquerading to that of all mas- querading, even though it addresses very lit- tle of the literature on this subject in Africa or elsewhere. Nonetheless, despite long-stand- ing Western fascination with what might be called "the terror of the mask," there are very few sympathetic and scholarly explorations of the affective environment of ritual masquer- ading in Africa. Birch de Aguilar provides such an invaluable study, based on her obser- vation of more than fifty dance performances from 1984 to 1992. In chapters one, six, and seven, Birch de Aguilar concentrates on the ritual roles of Nyau 10 masks in funerals and initiations for both girls and boys.2 She ends by proposing a totalizing and cosmological interpretation of Nyau. In her view the naturalistic anthropomorphic face- pieces danced during the daytime evoke "the ancestors as real people, as relatives who have died" (p. 186). By contrast, the large, abstract maquettes of animals, usually performed at night, represent chirombo, invisible wild animal spirits. The most important of these is the huge antelope-morph Kasiyamaliro, which appears at nearly every important rite. Birch de Aguilar interprets the materials, colors, and form of Kasiyamaliro as symbolizing agricultural and cosmological life cycles of death and rebirth. Since Arnold Van Gennep (1960 [1908]), many researchers have described initiation rit- uals, in which one social identity is exchanged for another, as a form of death and rebirth. However, Birch de Aguilar is concerned here with the physical fact of death itself. She takes inspiration from the work of the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur to consider Chewa masks as root metaphors that make it possible to " 'feel' and imagine and think of potential realities about death without having experi- enced death itself" (p. 29). The book's title derives also from Ricoeur's argument that actions may be submitted to some of the same interpretive strategies as texts, because they inspire a discourse that is "fixed" (or in- scribed) after a temporal disjuncture (p. 23). Because metaphor has the power to disclose more than a speaker may realize (p. 27), Birch de Aguilar describes her interpretive method in this section as "reconstructing a new inter- pretation of the whole" based on separate exe- gesis of the parts (p. 216). It is not clear how this method of "total interpretation" (p. 222) is different, say, from that practiced by Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen in The Pale Fox in forming a cosmological metanarrative for the Dogon (1986 [1965]).3 Birch de Aguilar leaves it up to the reader to judge the "validity" of the inter- pretation (p. 32). And yet, what criteria will the reader be able to use? Let us examine this practice at work (p. 211): As one man explained to me, the secret is that the thing which makes this move, which gives it life, is man. The importance of the secret is that the spir- it from the graveyard is given life only through man. This may be interpreted further in light of the creation myth, that God, the creative force, gave this life to man. In the face of the horror of death, of the burning of the world, God still gave man life, and man must suf- fer the horror of death to be reunited with God in another life. In constructing a persuasive narrative, the author first evokes a Chewa voice ("As one man explained to me"). The voice is evoked. It is not quoted verbatim, although there is something of the flavor of spoken language in the phrasing of the sentence. Because there is no direct quotation, the accuracy of the trans- lation can never be measured. Despite the unresolved "crisis" in ethnography, most texts-my own included-take their "author- ity" (to borrow James Clifford's famous for- mulation) from the figure of the researcher as student of a member of the home culture, of someone in the know. Next the "importance of the secret" is revealed. Who is speaking now? Is it still the Chewa man? In terms of syntax, one cannot be sure, but this seems to be implied. And yet the sentiment sounds rather French existen- tial. To bolster its claims, the text next invokes "the creation myth" as a key interpretive tool, although it was earlier introduced as "a cre- ation myth" (p. 188) in what is apparently a varied tradition (p. 191, n. 16). Where does the authority lie for linking "the" creation story with the problem of the man in the mask? I would have felt more equipped as a reader to evaluate the author's interpretation if she had quoted her Chewa associates in more extend- ed passages and provided more information about Chewa religion, especially attitudes toward death and the role of nature spirits. Unlike Griaule, Birch de Aguilar is scrupu- lous about flagging her own speculations with "I suggest" or "I interpret." There is no mono- lithic voice representing what "the" mask means to "the" Chewa. I particularly admire the author's sensitivity to diverse subject positions within Chewa society, including children, senior woman, initiated chiefs, Chris- tians, and artists (pp. 109-10).

In the past, some might have argued for a lost protohistorical origin for the Nyau masquer- ading society, for a collective Chewa uncon- scious, for deep social structures. Today, what role does the totalizing narrative play, given the admitted variety in Chewa forms and beliefs, and given substantive social and his- torical change in Nyau (outlined in Kaspin 1993:34-57)? This is a question that all ethnog- raphers face, but one made especially acute in Inscribing the Mask because of its focus on mas- querade as "text." In the second, third, and fourth chapters, the author examines the masks of Nyau as a site of discourse on history and social rela- tionships. These essays present complex arguments to which I cannot do justice here. It is the fifth chapter, on the "Individual Mask," that will most interest-and frus- trate-many readers of African Arts. Birch de Aguilar asserts that "[e]ach carved mask is distinct from another" (p. 127), that dancers can make long journeys to commission face- pieces from particular sculptors (p. 135), and that the "fact that a mask can be attributed to a known carver is one important aspect of how Chewa people understand masks as individual, unique objects..." (p. 136). The author gives an extraordinary account of sculptors searching graveyards and refuse autumn 1998 ? african arts heaps at night in order to make their masks "in secrecy." In a discussion of "portraiture," she also reveals that many carved facepieces are understood as "physiognomic likenesses of known people" (p. 136), sometimes de- ceased, sometimes alive. This chapter provides exciting new mater- ial on Chewa sculpture and portraiture. And yet, unaccountably, not one photograph is coordinated with the text in this or any other chapter. The assertions rest without any kind of visual documentation and demonstrate lit- tle faith in the argument for an individual object's unique identity. What grounds for quality do patrons cite? The thirty color field photographs bound in the back of the book float without extrinsic value, like the slide shows that some anthropologists append to the end of their talks. Familiarity with the important work pub- lished on portraiture in African art would have revealed that the construction of "resemblance" is anything but obvious.4 The issue of historical depth is also imperative, since in this century the social identity of the artist has undergone tremendous change across sub-Saharan Africa, and there are claims of increasing emphasis on mimetic naturalism in art. It is not enough to assert that "[s]imilarities are recognizable in masks dating from the early 1900s" (p. 36)-masks that are also not illustrated. What kinds of similarities? What does the fact that there are no professional carvers among Chewa in Zambia (p. 127, n. 1) imply about the history of portraiture among the Chewa in Malawi and the author's interpretation of the ritual use of "realism" (p. 186)?5 Secrecy is an important subtext of Inscrib- ing the Mask, and future publications will have to theorize and contextualize the issue of secrecy in Nyau. Birch de Aguilar writes that most of her field associates requested anonymity and that it sometimes required "great courage...to share their knowledge" with her (p. 19). Presumably these require- ments are responsible for the cursory identifi- cations that accompany the photographs. Apart from the issue of naming individuals, however, the author does not speak about how demands for secrecy shaped either her research or her publications.6 How was it that the "insistent discourse about masks as a great secret" (p. 15) did not preclude her own "initiation" (another issue that should be problematized) into both the male and female sides of Nyau (pp. 168, 171)? And what does "secret society" mean when nearly every Chewa boy (Yoshida 1993:35; Kaspin 1993:35) and some women are initiated? This is not an easy book for the nonspe- cialist to read. It is poorly edited, perhaps because it was published by a German-lan- guage press. More important, it presumes too much knowledge about Nyau and the Chewa.

The present order of the chapters is confusing, because the text repeatedly refers to certain events before they are adequately contextualized. For exam- ple, it makes more sense to read references to the girls' initiation after chapter six, which describes the relationship between women and the masks. To minimize this difficulty, I would recommend that nonspecialists read the book in the following order: chapters one, six, seven, five, two, three, four. Inscribing the Mask tries to do a great many things, all of them interesting, not all of them equally well fleshed out. The book really shines in evoking the emotive environment of Chewa masquerading, so that we do not for- get that a funeral is more than an academic puzzle (p. 154): Ultimately for the village community, the sight of the masked dancers is a memory of death and dying, of losing someone known to them. Perhaps this removes some of the misunderstand- ing of why these masks are described by the Chewa as being so dreadful and frightful, as being like the dead.... Another strength lies in the fact that the author has witnessed so many performances that she can chart the changing associations of a given facepiece and its dancer (pp. 12 142-51). As a result, Birch de Aguilar gives us one of the most complex analyses to date of the rich, polysemic nature of an African mas- querading tradition. O Notes, page 89 THE SHAPE OF BELIEF African Art from the Dr. Michael R. Heide Collection Mary Nooter Roberts and Allen F. Roberts Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, San Fran- cisco, 1996. Distributed by the University of Wash- ington Press, Seattle. 96 pp., 72 color photos, map, bibliography. $25 softcover. Reviewed by Emily Hanna-Vergara The Shape of Belief presents a collection of African art bequeathed to the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco by the late Dr. Michael Heide in 1993. An exhibition of Heide's collection, curated by Kathleen Berrin, was held at the museum from Novem- ber 1996 through April 1997. The first component of this exhibition cat- alogue is an essay by Berrin, who came to know Heide, a psychiatrist, about a year and a half before his death. According to Berrin, he had two longings early in life: to go to Africa and to become a doctor. She describes Heide's experiences in Africa, beginning with a Peace Corps assignment in 1968-1970 as an elemen- tary-school teacher in a Mende village in Sierra Leone. He then became interested in African art and began amassing his own col- lection. Upon his return to the States, Heide continued to collect, sell, and exhibit African art, in part to finance his medical school train- ing, and at least on one occasion to raise funds for a relief effort in Africa. He returned to the continent several times, and his interest in the collection of and trade in African art contin- ued throughout his life. There is no statement from Heide himself in the catalogue. This is unfortunate, as it is often interesting to consider the perspective of the collector and his or her efforts to build a group of objects according to personal sensi- bilities or compulsions. Heide's gift to the museum consists of seventy artworks from the coastal countries of West Africa, from Guinea to Cameroon. Berrin notes that the majority of works come from Nigeria and that there are more masks than other kinds of sculpture. However, it is left to the viewer to search for the more subtle patters that emerge from the collection to reveal Heide's aesthetic sense and his intellectual response to African cre- ative expression. In the central essay of the book, Mary Nooter Roberts and Allen F Roberts create a framework from which to consider the works of art in Heide's collection and African art in general. Rather than providing the standard african arts ? autumn 1998 1 t asa ' I w, I</page><page sequence="4">essays are clogged with critical jargon or dogma, but more speak in a fresh voice diver- gent from the orthodox (e.g., Mweze, Maldoror, Bouzid, and Tomaselli). Political and critical methodology saturates some articles while oth- ers express personal experience and philoso- phy. The historical articles, tedious with facts, are useful if not exciting. Ssali's excellent essay, "Apartheid and Cinema," which focuses not on apartheid but rather the entire colonial period, merges historical information with political and cultural interpretation. The primary audience of African Experi- ences of Cinema is specialists and students in African film and culture, although film schol- ars in general should also be attentive. It is suitable for college undergraduates and grad- uate students, and perhaps even advanced high school students. Since few of the gener- al public have seen African films (or even know they exist), the book is unlikely to appeal to them. The brief additional bibliographies for each of the four essay sections are beneficial. Budget constraints probably account for the total lack of photographs and film stills, a par- ticularly unfortunate omission in a book about a visual medium. For students of African art, African Ex- periences of Cinema offers a feast of information about the extremely difficult conditions under which these filmmakers operate. It seems a miracle that any African film-much less the ambitious, artistic creations-ever reaches final production. Because of the high technical expenses and the large number of people involved, economic realities plague filmmak- ers to a much greater extent than they do painters, sculptors, or other artisans. However, African artists in all the media are vexed by problems of making a living from their art and marketing their wares. The intersection of filmmaking with other arts such as drama and oral narrative (see Diawara, "Popular Culture"), music, and dance instructs our understanding of all African arts, which share cultural symbols and aesthetic principles such as structure, rhythm, juxtaposition, symmetry/asymme- try, contrast/repetition, abstraction/realism. I wish the book had included more on the sig- nificant question of what makes African aes- thetics distinctive and how such principles are incarnated into artworks. This fascinating issue is ripe for exploration. The richest materials for art scholars illumi- nate the nature of the creative process and audi- ence reception (see particularly Bouzid, Maldoror, and Mweze). The most important essays analyzing individual films are those by Diouf, Ukadike, Diawara ("Popular Culture"), and Pfaff. These articles, offering thematic- and sometimes cinematic- explication of films in their cultural context are relatively recent and reflect the new confidence that African film transcends a mere documentary witness and achieves the complex subtlety of great art. I hope that African film scholars and critics will increasingly explore such issues-especially cinematography-which make African films genuinely "moving" pictures. D autumn 1998 african arts notes STROTHER: Notes, from page 12 Many thanks to Eugenia W. Herbert and to Elisabeth Cameron for their review of this review. 1. Birch de Aguilar borrows the evocative phrase "ritual dread" from the poem "Lament of the Images" by Ben Okri (p. 13): And when the Images began To speak In forgotten tongues Of death The artists of the alien Land Twisted the pain Of their speech And created a new Chemistry Which, purified of ritual Dread, They called Art. Since the text does not identify Okri as a Nigerian novelist, uninformed readers might mistake his oft-cited voice for that of a Chewa speaker. Beyond Okri, in the focus on "dread" as a return to the fundamental core of religion, one hears an echo of Rudolf Otto's influential work, The Idea of the Holy, which identifies "religious dread" as "the starting point for the entire religious development in history" (1958 [1917]:14). In the poem, I do not know which artists Okri imagines have stripped African masks of their "ritual dread." In my view, the African mask has served as the very icon of "ritual dread" in twentieth-century visual culture. One need only think of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), of Dada, of urban shamanism, and of the screaming meanies on The Twilight Zone. 2. Birch de Aguilar provides new information on women wearing masks (pp. 34 [n. 3], 105, 172). My informal indexing of important passages on the relationship of women to mas- querading include: 34, 56, 105, 108-11, 115 (n. 11), 136, 137, 139, 157-69, 171-75, 193-95, 200 (n. 30). 3. See the critique by Walter Van Beek (1991). 4. For example, Borgatti &amp; Brilliant (1990), Borgatti (1991), Fischer (1984), Himmelheber (1972). 5. Yoshida reports: "It is customary for every nyau member to make his own feathered or wooden mask and to continue to wear it on appropriate ritual occasions as long as it lasts. While someone might commission a mask from a man with a well-known talent for carving, there are no professional carvers as such" (1992:220). 6. Yoshida writes that he obtained permission to "reveal some nyau secrets for 'educational purposes' " and has abridged certain texts in order to avoid unnecessary disclosure of coded information (1993:92, notes 6, 8). Kaspin notes that she was wared repeatedly to keep her notes and photographs out of the eyesight of inquisitive children (1993:46). References cited Borgatti, Jean M. (ed.). 1990.

This limitation is acknowledged in the book's preface, writ- ten by Rayda Becker, Director of the Gertrude Posel Gallery. 2. Rankin had the advantage of hindsight here; her book Images of Wood (1989) was read by these audiences, so she kept them in mind while writing Images of Metal. All of Rankin's reflections about the writing of this book were expressed in two personal interviews conducted at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, on November 18,1997, and December 9,1997. 3. As with Images of Wood, Rankin went to great lengths to find both women sculptors and black sculptors. Though this chapter inaugurates serious research in these arenas, much work remains. Rankin decided that equitable inclusion of women and black sculptors of metal in an introductory text would present a false picture. As she put it, "One can't write a holistic history about things that aren't whole." 4. In my interview of December 9, Rankin explained that a great many texts closely examine this topic, and that in the process of selecting issues from a vast amount of material, she chose not to delve into this area. 5.
