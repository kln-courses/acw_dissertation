<plain_text><page sequence="1">5 An Early Group of Crosses from the Kingdom of Ossory Nancy Edwards, Member A discussion of the form and layout, the ornamental repertoire and thefigural iconography of these crosses. This group shows close affinities with both Hiberno-Saxon metalwork and late eighth or early ninth century sculpture in Scotland. This group of crosses clusters on two sites, Ahenny and Kilkieran, situated in the Slievanamon hills to the north of the River Suir (Fig 1). In the early medieval period this area was part of the kingdom of Ossory, a powerful buffer state between the Laigin to the north and the Eoghanacht to the west (Mac Niocaill 1972, 85; 6 Corrain 1972, 6). Nothing is known about the monasteries which must once have flourished at Ahenny and Kilkieran; they cannot even be identified as names in the annals. This anonymity has led to a considerable amount of speculation as to their connections (Curie 1939-40, 103-4; Henry 1965, 141; Henderson 1982, 86) which includes a suggestion by Henry (1965, 138) that they could be linked with the important monastery of Lismore. This cannot be established since Lismore has no surviving diagnostic sculpture and seems most unlikely as the monastery's sphere of interest was concentrated on south Munster. However it may be possible to suggest that Ahenny and Kilkieran looked towards Seir Kieran whose founder, Ciaran of Saighir, was also patron saint of Ossory (Carrigan 1905,1, vii, 1-2; Kenney 1929, 316, 318, 394). Here, amongst the extensive archaeological remains (Hughes and Hamlin 1977,124), is a cross base which may be included in this group. There are two further outliers at Lorrha, an important monastery founded by St Riiadan, which is situated on the borders of Munster and Connaught (Kenney 1929, 391-2; Gleeson 1915, 230-3). Therefore the group to be discussed consists of four complete crosses: Ahenny North (Figs 10,11) and South (Fig 12), and Kilkieran East (Fig 14) and West (Figs 13, 14). In addition there are two cross bases with shaft fragments from Lorrha, East (Fig 15) and West (Fig 16), and a cross base from Seir Kieran (Fig 17). These crosses were originally loosely grouped with some others by Henry (1940, 103-6; 1965, 139-41) and they have also been described by Roe (1962) together with other monuments from the same locality. The aim of this article is to examine them in more detail. It will discuss their form and layout, analyse the abstract ornament and study the figural iconography in order to place them more firmly in their artistic context in relation to both Hiberno-Saxon sculpture elsewhere and objects in other media, particularly metalwork.

The Form and Layout of the Crosses Amongst this group the form of the cross is extremely important. The sculptor does not merely display his repertoire upon a monumental cross, but rather the layout is completely dictated by that form and is designed to fulfil particular functions in relation to it. The forms of the crosses which survive complete are closely comparable. They are characterised by a very large crosshead in comparison with the length of the shaft, which often has a 'butt' or step at the bottom, and the tendency towards a very large base. In each case the crosshead has the characteristic wheel, the upper cross arm is elongated and bosses are placed at the centre of the crosshead, on the cross arms and at the top of the shaft. There are no other precise parallels in Ireland but the position of the wheel may be compared with some of the more developed Class II monuments in Pictland (Stevenson 1955, 120-3). The best parallel is Aberlemno 3 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 228A), where the wide wheel arcs and the use of bosses is</page><page sequence="3">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 7 very similar to the Ossory crosses. Henderson (1978, 53) has suggested that this Pictish crosshead form may have developed under Irish influence, and this is possible, but it is also interesting to note that in Pictish sculpture the wheel arcs begin as cusps, on Aberlemno 2 for example (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 227A), possibly passing onto free-standing crosses at Iona (Stevenson 1956, 89) before reaching their maximum development on the later Class II and III monuments exemplified by Aberlemno 3. The conical capstones placed on top of the surviving crossheads of the Ossory crosses have always been problematical. The caps, which had been found nearby, were placed on the crossheads at Kilkieran and 'restored to their proper place' at Ahenny during the nineteenth century (O'Neill 1857, II, PI. XXVI; Carrigan 1905, IV, 243) and, since none can be proved without doubt to have had caps before this, much discussion has resulted as to whether the caps are original. Crawford (1909, 256) believed that they were genuine since they fitted and the plaitwork on the cap of Ahenny North was in keeping with the rest of the ornament but Roe (1962, 13), disagreeing with both these points, was more doubtful. The question would probably be answered satisfactorily if the capstones were removed to see whether there was a tenon protruding from the upper cross arm to support the capstone as at Kilree (Roe 1962, 13; Henry 1965, PI. 75) but in the meantime to hold that they were original seems the more promising hypothesis for a number of reasons. Firstly, there are no horizontal perimeter mouldings along the top of the upper cross arm on the narrow faces of the crosses. This suggests the use of a capstone since otherwise the top cross arms would have appeared unfinished. Secondly, the proportions of the cross with their large bases would have looked unbalanced without a cap, and finally the adoption of the capstone is commonplace amongst the Irish crosses; it is merely the conical form which is unique to this group. The proportions of the surviving shafts are approximately similar. A characteristic stylistic detail is the division of the narrow faces of the shaft vertically into three panels as on Ahenny North, Ahenny South and Kilkieran West. The same feature is found on Kilree and Killamery (Henry 1933, Pis. 29, 30). The division of the wheel arcs into two vertical panels on the narrow faces is also characteristic of Ahenny North, Ahenny South and Kilkieran West and it is also paralleled on Clonmacnois South (Henry 1933, PI. 56). The cross bases are shaped like truncated pyramids. Ahenny North has two steps, the upper very much shallower than the lower and the butt acting as a further gradine before the commencement of the shaft. Kilkieran West has three steps and the bases of Seir Kieran and Lorrha West are of even more monumental proportions, the latter having the addition of a sloping plinth on the top of the uppermost step. These may be compared with Clonmacnois South (Henry 1965, PI. 84). The bases of Ahenny South and Kilkieran East are much smaller and have only one step. The perimeter mouldings carved in high relief and hatched to give the appearance of rope are a characteristic of this group which immediately catches the eye. As Henry recognised (1965,140) these are clearly derivative of metalwork bindings such as those on the Copenhagen shrine (1965, PI. 20). There is an early example of similar hatching on the perimeters of the mounts on the Sutton Hoo hanging bowl (Bruce-Mitford 1972, PI. 9) and cabled hoops are also common on penannular</page><page sequence="4">8 NANCY EDWARDS brooches, for example, the brooch from Ballinderry II which Kilbride-Jones (1937, 443) originally dated 750-800. There are similar bindings on the Ardagh chalice and on the Tara brooch delicate filigree cables are frequently used to frame panels of ornament (Henry 1965, Pis. 39-41). The metalwork derivation of the perimeter mouldings is clearest on Ahenny North and South. On Kilkieran West they seem much heavier and therefore lose much of their metallic quality. Perimeter rope mouldings are also found elsewhere on the Irish crosses on Killamery and Clonmacnois South (Henry 1965, PI. 67, 84-5) but here they are hatched with a herring-bone design rather than cabled. The use of perimeter rope mouldings in high relief results in the corresponding recession of the ornamental areas on the shafts and crossheads. This is less marked on the broad than on the narrow faces and on Lorrha East and West only the narrow faces are recessed. The use of recessed panels but with less emphasis on the mouldings is a feature of Pictish 'Boss Style' best exemplified by Nigg and is continued on the developed Class II slab, Rosemarkie 1 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Figs 72, 60, 60A). Frames decorated with tight meshes of interlace as, for example, on Rosemarkie 1 and the St Andrews shrine (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 365) may also be distinguished on the base of Ahenny South Face D where there are traces of a plaitwork mesh. Roe (1962, Fig 3) suggested that the crosses on the mouldings which project into the sculptural field on this cross base may be derived from the end panels of Early Christian sarcophagi. These may be divided vertically in a similar fashion as, for example, on a possible sarcophagus fragment from Breedon in Mercia (Cramp 1977, Fig 57a). This is not impossible but it may merely be an example of the almost constant repetition of the cross symbol in Christian art (Stevenson 1981-2). The bosses placed at the centre of the crosshead, at the ends of the cross arms and at the top of the shaft are a characteristic feature of the Ossory crosses, appearing on Ahenny North, Ahenny South and Kilkieran West. On Kilkieran East there is a single boss in the centre of the crosshead. On Ahenny North there are small domed bosses decorated with interlace patterns and 'nailhead' bosses. The former may be compared with bosses in similar positions on Bealin, Clonmacnois South and Kilree (Crawford 1927, PI. XII; Henry 1965, Pis. 75, 84-5) but the latter undoubtedly owe their origins to metalwork and it is their resemblance to (les boutons couvre-clous emaillesf (Henry 1933, 50) which has resulted in the term 'nailhead' bosses. The central 'nailhead' boss on Face A, with its raised cruciform centre composed of possible zoomorphic heads, is particularly elaborate. On Ahenny South the bosses are less complex but retain much of their metallic quality. However on Kilkieran West they are much heavier and more bulbous and their metallic origins are no longer clear. The development of such bosses in both sculpture and metalwork is an important aid to placing the Ossory crosses in the wider context of Hiberno-Saxon art. Their ultimate origins could lie in Anglo-Saxon metalwork (Henderson, unpublished lecture 1977) as, for example, the domed bosses on the base of the Ormside bowl (Kendrick 1938, PI. 60) but they are also taken up by Hiberno-Saxon metalworkers, attaining their most complex and sophisticated forms on the Ardagh chalice, the St Germain plaques (Henry 1965, Pis. 39, 66) and many of the more developed panannular brooches. It is with these, and the Tara brooch in particular (Henry 1965,</page><page sequence="5">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 9 Pis. 38,40,41), with its wide variety of 'nailhead' bosses, that the Ahenny North and South bosses have most in common. In Pictish sculpture Curie (1939-40, 97ff) and Stevenson (1955,117ff) have traced the parallel development of high relief 'Boss Style' culminating in monuments such as Aberlemno 3, the St Andrews sarcophagus, Nigg and fragments from Tarbat (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Figs 228A, 365, 72, 91, 92). However it is the Dalriadic 'Boss Style' crosses centred on Iona which provide the closest comparisons for the Ahenny bosses (Stevenson 1956, 91-2). The layout of the bosses on the crossheads of St John's, St Martin's and Kildalton in Islay are identical (The Royal Commission 1982, 17-9, 198-9, 204; Close-Brooks and Stevenson 1982, 19). It is possible that these three crosses show a gradual development from small 'nailhead' bosses on St John's cross, through the meshed bosses on St Martin's to the bulbous domed bosses on the Kildalton Cross. There could be a similar development between the bosses on Ahenny North with their clear metalwork origins and their more bulbous counterparts on Kilkieran West. 'Nailhead' bosses are also translated into two dimensions for the manuscript medium where they appear in the Book of Kells (f2V, F33R; Henry 1940,14). Apart from Kilkieran East, which is undecorated, these crosses are dominated by abstract ornament. As Henry said 'not a square inch of the surface remains unadorned; ornaments run on the stone, covering it like embroidery' (1965, 140). There are figural motives but these are confined to the cross bases. Spirals Spirals are not the most prolific ornament on these crosses (Fig 2) but the manner in which they are executed picks them out as one of the distinctive features of the o o p oa 6Tb a b c d Fig 2 Repertoire of Spiral Ornament a Ahenny North Face A crosshead, Face B shaft, Face C butt, Face D shaft; Kilkieran West Faces A and C shaft(?). b Ahenny South Face A lower wheel arcs, c Ahenny North Face A crosshead. d Ahenny South Faces B and D shaft, e Ahenny North Face B crosshead, Face C shaft, Face D crosshead; Ahenny South Face A shaft (two panels), Face B crosshead, Face C shaft, Face D crosshead; Kilkieran West Face A base, f Ahenny North Faces B and D butt.</page><page sequence="6">10 NANCY EDWARDS group, well illustrating the important influence exerted by both the techniques and the ornamental repertoire of Hiberno-Saxon metalwork. Spirals are used extensively on the Ahenny crosses but on Kilkieran West and Lorrha West their role is less conspicuous. There is no surviving spiral ornament on Lorrha East or Seir Kieran. The unique skill of the sculptor of Ahenny North is well illustrated by the complex spiral patterns which form the background to the bosses on Face A. As I have demonstrated elsewhere (Edwards 1983,5-6) the entire crosshead has been carefully constructed on a horizontal/vertical grid of squares. Two lines, one passing vertically down the centre of the cross, the other horizontal along the cross arms, can be seen quite clearly (Fig 3). If horizontal and vertical lines are added so that the centre of each spiral is constructed it will be found that a complex grid based on a 2.5cm unit measure is attained. All the spirals and bosses have diameters which correspond to multiples of this unit as do some of the dimensions of the crosshead itself. This grid gave the sculptor the basis for the execution of a comparatively simple pattern of interlocking'S' and 'C scrolls (Allen and Anderson 1903, II, Nos. 1051-63) (Fig. 2c). The variety is achieved by the constant change in the size of the spiral and the different spiral terminals: triple spiral cluster, bird's head and plain. The whole is unified by a style of carving clearly reminiscent of chip-carved ornament in Hiberno Saxon metalwork. The actual spirals are conceived in fairly flat relief but they are caught in an intricate web of deep-cut triangular shapes or expansions which cause the pattern to stand out. A good parallel for this kind of pattern is provided by a round flat bronze mount from a grave at Fonbekk in Norway (Petersen 1940, 16). The triple spiral cluster terminals may be compared with the Komnes mount (Petersen 1940, 22, Fig 12). In Pictish sculpture a further comparison may be made with a large rectangular spiral panel carved in low relief of a metallic appearance on the back of the 'Boss Style' slab at Shandwick (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Figs 66A, 70). The crosshead of Ahenny North Face A is the only spiral pattern on these crosses where the constructional methods used in the design are clear. In fact some patterns, especially on the smaller panels which are less conspicuously placed, have a distinctly freehand appearance. This may be exemplified by the central long vertical shaft panels on Ahenny North Faces B and D (Fig 2a), where the diameters of the spirals and the lengths of the scrolls connecting them vary considerably since the pattern, a single border of'S' scrolls (Allen and Anderson 1903, II, Nos. 1042-8), has to expand to accommodate the increasing width of the panel. This pattern occurs frequently in metalwork borders, for example those on the St Germain plaques, the base of the Ardagh chalice, the Prestgarden mount and the Derrynavlan paten stand (Mahr 1932, Pis. 26, 52; Peterson 1940,15, Fig, 3; Ryan 1980,1). The upper shaft panel on Face C is decorated with a square panel pattern of five spirals (Allen and Anderson 1903, II, Nos. 1072-85) (Fig 2e), which is particularly characteristic of this group of crosses but is uncommon elsewhere. There is an early version in an incised technique on the Mullaghmast stone and further examples on Clonmacnois South where the spirals are raised into bosses, Clonmacnois West and Castledermot South (Coffey 1903, 263-6, PI. XXII; Henry 1965, PI. 85; Henry 1933, PI. 78,4; Henry 1967, PI. 67) and in Pictland on Meigle 5 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 314A). In metalwork there are also examples on the Moylough belt-shrine</page><page sequence="7">crosses from the kingdom of OSSORY 11 I I oool I 0 50 . 100 150cm SPIRAL AND BOSS DIAMETERS 0 ? ? 0 o 5cm 10cm 12 5cm 15cm 20cm Fig 3 Ahenny North Face A, Construction of Spirals. (O'Kelly 1964, Pis. 21-2). There are no precise parallels for the style of carving although spiral ornament is used in a similar way in Pictland on St Vigeans 7 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 278) and a fragment from Applecross (unpublished) has deeply slashed triangular expansions reminiscent of metalwork techniques. The bird's head terminals on the Ahenny North panel may also be compared with those on St Vigeans 7 and Applecross and on Irish sculpture with Tybroughney, Kilree and the North Shaft, Clonmacnois (Crawford 1908, Figs 2-3; Henry 1965, Pis. 75, 91). The triangular 'C scroll expansions are similar to those on an unpublished shaft from Clonmacnois in the National Museum, Dublin.</page><page sequence="8">12 NANCY EDWARDS The same square panel pattern is characteristic of Ahenny South where spirals are used extensively but the repertoire is small (Fig 2b, d, e). The panel at the bottom of the shaft on Face C may be closely compared with that on Ahenny North Face C but the stylistic details of the two shaft panels on Face A are rather different. The variations are achieved by constant changes in the diameters of the spirals, the use of spiral curlicues on the expansions in the upper panel, a detail paralleled on Tybroughney and Clonmacnois South (Crawford 1908, Figs 2, 3; Henry 1965, PI. 85), and the use of foliageous spiral terminals. These feathery leaves are also found in metalwork as, for example, on the Vindalen mount which is decorated in an openwork technique (Petersen 1940, 26). Other comparisons may be made with roundels on the Copenhagen shrine and the St Germain plaques (Mahr 1932, Pis. 16, 26). In addition some of the Ahenny South spirals are hollowed out. This, again, is found on Tybroughney but is apparently unparalleled on surviving metalwork. As Henry has commented (1965, 140) the sculptors of these crosses were fascinated by the complexities of perspective and these 'hollowed bosses' provide a further example of this. There is much less spiral ornament on Kilkieran West and the influence of metalworking techniques, especially chip-carving, is also less apparent. The shaft panels on Faces A and C are placed in similar positions to those on Ahenny North and South. Both are badly weathered but they probably consist of two single borders of'S' scrolls (Fig 2a), a common way of filling wide borders on metal objects, as for example, Christ's robe on the Athlone Crucifixion plaque (Henry 1965, PI. 46). The panels are executed in low, rather flat relief, the mesh of strands down the centre of the panel on Face A being the only surviving stylistic detail reminiscent of metalworking techniques. The panel on the base of Face A is a further example of the square panel pattern already discussed (Fig 2e). The only surviving spiral pattern on Lorrha West is in an identical position. The style of carving appears crude and there is no indication of metalworking techniques. The pattern, which is severely weathered, is now difficult to reconstruct, but it may fall into the same category as spiral roundels (Allen and Anderson 1903, II, Nos. 1088-1111), sometimes set in a square frame, found on Kells South, Tihilly and Kinnitty and in Pictland on Aberlemno 2 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 227A; Roe 1966, PI. II; Henry 1933, Pis. 91, 92). Therefore, although there is a considerable amount of spiral ornament on these crosses, the repertoire is surprisingly small. The ornament appears at its most complex on Ahenny North; the rest have similar patterns but they are executed more simply and less well. The distinctive style of carving on Ahenny North and South emerges as heavily influenced by Hiberno-Saxon chip-carved metalwork. Less close parallels may be suggested with Northern Pictish sculpture, particularly Shandwick, Applecross and Tarbat (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Figs 92, 93, 95-6; Henderson 1982, 56). Interlace Interlace ornament is used prolifically throughout the group but the repertoire of patterns (Figs 4, 5) is extremely simple. Almost every pattern is made up of simple plaitwork incorporating a varying number of strands; interlace elements A - F</page><page sequence="9">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 13 I I I I a b c d e f g h i Fig 4 Repertoire of Interlace: plaitwork a 2 strand Ahenny North Face A shaft; Ahenny South Faces A, B, C, D crosshead; Kilkieran West Face A wheel arcs, Faces B and D crosshead, wheel arcs, shaft, Face C crosshead and wheel arcs, b 3 strand Ahenny North Face C crosshead. c 4 strand Ahenny North Face C crosshead; Ahenny South Face A crosshead; Kilkieran West Face B crosshead, shaft, base; Seir Kieran Faces A and B. d 6 strand Ahenny North Faces B and C crosshead; Ahenny South Face B shaft, Face C crosshead; Kilkieran West Faces A and B base, Face D crosshead, shaft, base; Lorrha West Face D shaft (?); Lorrha East Faces B and D shaft, e 8 strand Ahenny South Face C crosshead; Kilkieran West Face C crosshead, Face D base; Lorrha East Face D shaft, f 10strand Ahenny North Face C crosshead; Kilkieran West FaceD base, g 12 strand Kilkieran West Faces A and D base; Lorrha East Faces A and B shaft, h 16 strand Kilkieran West Face C shaft; Lorrha West Face A base, i 22 strand Kilkieran West Faces B and D base.</page><page sequence="10">14 NANCY EDWARDS abed e f g h i j k i m n Fig 5 Repertoire of Interlace: knotwork a Basic C Ahenny North Face C crosshead. b Basic C as a roundel Ahenny North Face A crosshead. c Basic C Turned Ahenny North Face C crosshead. d Half C Ahenny North Face C crosshead. e Basic E (single element) Ahenny North Face C crosshead. f Simple E Ahenny North Face C crosshead. g Simple E (variation) Ahenny North Face D crosshead; Ahenny South Faces B and D crosshead. h Simple E (variation) Ahenny South Face A crosshead. i Simple E (variation) Ahenny North Face A shaft, j Simple F Ahenny North Face A crosshead. k Simple F (variation) Ahenny North Face D lower wheel arc; Ahenny South Face A upper wheel arcs.

The question arises as to how these patterns were constructed. The even plaitwork on the crosshead of Ahenny North Face C testifies to the use of constructional aids in the execution of the pattern (Edwards 1983, 5-6) but with other crosses in the group this is much more difficult to ascertain. Many of the patterns appear uneven and on Kilkieran West the orderliness of the plaitwork mesh sometimes breaks down completely. This suggests that there was much less forethought before the patterns were executed. The key to the problem seems to lie in whether a grid was used as a basis to construct the patterns and if so whether it was a horizontal/vertical or a diagonal grid. The likelihood of a horizontal/vertical or diagonal grid is established by measuring the vertical, horizontal and diagonal distances between the crossing points of the interlace strands (Edwards 1983, 6-7). On these crosses, except for Ahenny North, the diagonal measurement between the crossing points is frequently more consistent than those on the horizontal or vertical, thereby suggesting a diagonal grid. Therefore it appears that both horizontal/vertical and diagonal grids were used. However in some cases the patterns are so uneven it seems unlikely that any constructional grid was adopted. Perhaps the crossing points of the strands were merely worked out in advance by eye. It is difficult to know whether the interlace patterns on these crosses were constructed using grids of similar proportions. Those on Ahenny North use a 2.5cm horizontal/vertical grid, the same as for the spirals on the crosshead of Face A, and thereby display an overall unity of design for that cross and it is possible that the interlace grids on Ahenny South, for example the upper cross arm of Face A, are related to this. The constructional methods employed for the interlace on Kilkieran West, Lorrha West and East may also be similar. Diagonal grids seem likely on these crosses and the distances between the crossing points of the interlace strands, that is the unit measure, are frequently 1.5cm or proportions of this, 3cm and 4.5cm. The interlace strands on all these crosses are rounded and carved in quite high relief. Usually the strands are plain though on Ahenny South there are examples of a strand with a median groove. The background ornament on the crosshead of Ahenny North Face C shows the sculptor's grasp of interlace is infinitely superior compared to the sculptors of other crosses in this group, both in the choice of pattern and in the manner of its execution. At first glance the pattern appears as a continuous mesh of plaitwork. However, on closer inspection, it will be seen that the potential monotony is constantly broken by the introduction of simple knotwork devices (Fig 5a, c, d, e, f) and there are also two negative crosses (Stevenson 1981-2, 12ff) on the top cross arm. These details demonstrate that the sculptor, although he favoured basic plaitwork designs, was also acquainted with proper knotwork patterns. The interlace elsewhere on Ahenny North is also simple. The use of Basic C (Fig 5b) on the bosses on the horizontal cross arms of Face A may be compared with the flat central roundel on Bealin (Crawford 1927, PI. XII). Other patterns consist entirely of combinations of Simple E or F elements (Figs 4a, d; 5g, i, k, 1) or small areas of plaitwork. The use of two parallel bands of Simple F on the lower wheel arc of Face D is particularly characteristic of the Ossory monuments.</page><page sequence="12">16 NANCY EDWARDS The interlace on Ahenny South, though extensive, is not nearly so competent or elegant as that on Ahenny North. The patterns are almost all simple plaitwork meshes (Fig 4a, c, d, e); the only knotwork elements used are Simple E and F (Fig 5g, h, k) and this could suggest that the sculptor's knowledge of knotwork may have been severely limited. Patterns contained within rectangular areas are tackled with a fair degree of confidence, but as soon as an irregular area such as the crosshead is to be decorated the sculptor seems to have encountered difficulties which result in an uneven pattern. On the crosshead of Face A the strands are somewhat uneven but, by the introduction of pairs of confronted dragons at the four points where the cross arms broaden out, the sculptor has eliminated the worst difficulty of how to convert the plaitwork pattern to the greater width of the panel. On the crosshead of Face C the same problem has not been solved with so much dexterity because the sculptor has attempted to cover the entire area without a break in the plaitwork. The actual line of the pattern has, on the whole, been maintained but it has a clumsy uneven appearance; the sculptor has encountered particular difficulties at the points where the cross arms broaden out. On the upper cross arm there is a bold six-strand plait of elongated appearance. Elongation is a common characteristic of plaitwork patterns on these crosses. Interlace patterns are also found on the wheel arcs and the narrow faces of this cross but the patterns are very scrappy, being confined to short lengths of plaitwork and combinations of Simple E and F elements. On Kilkieran West nearly every panel, including the base, is decorated with simple plaitwork patterns (Fig 4) but no knotwork is included. In decorating the uneven field of the crosshead the sculptor has encountered the same problems as the sculptor of Ahenny South. The pattern on the upper part of the top cross arm on Face C is relatively even but the irregular area in the centre of the crosshead is a riot of uneven strands. The sculptor seems to have concentrated his skills entirely on filling every inch of available space rather than on maintaining an even pattern. The result suggests very little thought in the planning of the design. He has fared better on the crosshead of Face A since here the pattern is on a very small scale and the strands have been placed close together, making the transition between broad and narrow passages very much easier. To aid this the width of the interlace strand and the diagonal distance between the crossing points of the strands vary according to the size of the area. Occasionally the strands are broken and rejoined, as, for example, on the upper part of the crosshead, presumably to ease the monotony of a continuous plaitwork mesh. The problem of a uniform plaitwork mesh has been encountered elsewhere on this cross, for example the shaft panel on Face C, but in many cases the sculptor has attempted to break this potential monotony using a variety of different methods, some far more successful than others. Firstly, as indicated above, some of the plaitwork strands may be broken and rejoined. An interesting example of this is the central shaft panel on Face D where negative crosses have been introduced into the six-strand plait. Secondly, some panels have been broken up into different sized blocks, each decorated with plaitwork made up of a different number of strands. The density of the plaitwork mesh and the width of the strands vary from block to block as, for example, on the right-hand panel of the base of Face D. This also seems to have been attempted on the panel in a similar position on Face B but the line of the</page><page sequence="13">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 17 pattern has been completely lost. Here the sculptor seems to have been attempting to construct a plaitwork mesh with a negative cross in the centre but he seems to have tried to introduce an area of less dense plaitwork in the bottom right-hand corner. This has been a complete failure although why remains inexplicable since a plaitwork mesh is relatively easy to construct. There are a number of such blunders on this cross, particularly on the base, which led Roe to suggest (1962,40) that an apprentice was let loose on the base while the actual cross was the work of the master. This is unprovable but clearly some difficulties have arisen because the ornament was not sufficiently planned in advance. This panel gives the impression of having been altered in the course of execution. Thirdly, four and five petal marigolds form part of the plaitwork pattern on the left-hand panel on the base of Face B (Fig. 5m). This panel may be unfinished since part of the background round the five petal marigold in the bottom right-hand corner has not been cut away. The marigold is perhaps the only motif on this cross which betrays any spark of originality since, though commonplace and of little help as dating evidence (Haseloff 1958, 78-80; Hencken 1936, 197; Henry 1965, 130; Bailey 1974, 92-6), it is unusual on monumental sculpture, the only other examples being on Killamery and the crosshead from Templeneiry (Henry 1965, PI. 67; 6 hEailidhe 1967, 107). Motifs of this kind are much more commonly found on grave slabs (Lionard 1961, Fig 9). Other ways of breaking the repetitiveness of a plaitwork mesh include the introduction of glides or gaps between areas of interlace as on the top step of the base on Face B, and the tendency to elongate the plaitwork as already noted on Ahenny South. There is an example of this on the central shaft panel on Face B. The surviving interlace on Lorrha West shows close links with Kilkieran West and the plaitwork is equally simple (Fig 4d, h). For example the left-hand panel of the base on Lorrha West Face A shows the characteristic trick used on Kilkieran West of breaking and rejoining the plaitwork strands; a horizontal line can be traced clearly across the centre of the panel. The interlace on Seir Kieran is very fragmentary (Fig 4c) but the way in which the bottom step of Face C is divided into panels and the traces of plaitwork indicate its close affinities with Kilkieran West and Lorrha West. On Lorrha East the base is undecorated but the plaitwork meshes on the shaft (Fig 4d, e, g) appear similar to those on Kilkieran West although the narrow faces are not divided vertically into three panels. Like Kilkieran West also, the plaitwork varies in density and there is a tendency towards elongation. The plaitwork on Face C shows a further variation whereby a pattern of simple interlocking semi-circles (Allen and Anderson 1903, II, No. 76) (Fig 5n), a motif also found amongst the granite crosses of the Barrow Valley, has been set into the plaitwork mesh. Therefore, while the repertoire of interlace ornament on these crosses is very similar, the standard of execution varies considerably. The sculptor of Ahenny North had a clear grasp of the constructional methods of interlace and some knowledge of knotwork designs; the skill of the men who carved Kilkieran West, Lorrha East and West and Seir Kieran was undoubtedly inferior. Again, the parallels for these simple plaitwork patterns, particularly those on Ahenny North and South, are to be found on Hiberno-Saxon metalwork, especially objects carried out in a chip-carved technique. The concept of using interlace to fill the background of a given shape, as on the crossheads of this group, is found at an</page><page sequence="14">18 NANCY EDWARDS early date on the Lullingstone hanging bowl where an axe-shaped mount with a flat central roundel is filled in with a broad two-strand twist so as to block out the background completely (Haseloff 1958, 74, 80). This broad band interlace becomes adapted to manuscript illumination and also sculpture where it is used to decorate the entire crosshead on both faces of the Fahan Mura slab (Haseloff 1958, 84, 87; Henry 1965, Pis. 52, 54). Gradually the interlace strands become finer and in Hiberno Saxon metalwork this is represented in filigree, engraved and chip-carved techniques. A good example of chip-carved plaitwork, here used as a background between the snakes and bosses, may be seen on the St Germain plaques (Henry 1965, PI. 66). It is interesting to note that, as with the plaitwork on the Ossory crosses, the strands on these plaques are frequently broken and rejoined. A further parallel is provided by the engraved interlace background on the Copenhagen shrine (Henry 1965, PI. 20). Background plaitwork meshes are also found on many more mundane chip-carved pieces, for example the mounts from Seim, F0rde and St0le in Norway (Petersen 1940, Figs 45,47-8). Metallic border patterns have also been adopted to decorate the narrow faces of the shafts and the wheel arcs of these crosses. For example short lengths of plaitwork interspersed with Simple E and F elements is a feature of metalwork borders, especially on penannular brooches. For example, the ring of the Snasa brooch is divided into panels of six-strand plait, while the borders of the Bergtfy brooch show a variety of plaitwork and Simple E designs (Petersen 1940, 66, Fig 43a). Simple F elements are found on the border panels of the large brooch from Ardagh and the practice of decorating a panel with a repeated pattern either side of a central midrib as, for example, on the narrow faces of the wheel arcs of Ahenny North, is paralleled on the pin from the Tara brooch (Mahr 1932, PI. 54, 13). The stylistic detail of elongating plaitwork is also a metalwork characterictic as, for example, on the St Germain plaques and the Lough Erne shrine (Mahr 1932, PI. 9). On Kilkieran West the comparisons with chip-carved metalwork are not apparent but other metalwork parallels are. The simplicity of the pattern, the unevenness of the strand and the unaccountable mistakes are also found in later metalwork where spirals are rare and interlacings become 'dry and monotonous' (Henry 1967, 131). Some of the interlace designs ascribed to the late ninth or early tenth century phase of the Kells crozier (MacDermott 1955, 106, 81) are surprisingly similar to patterns on Kilkieran West. The panel on the lower binding strip (MacDermott 1955, PI. XXXIb, 96) shows a small wheelhead cross decorated with an uneven mesh of plaitwork similar to the crosshead of Kilkieran West Face C and the four strand plait below is similar to the central shaft panel on Face D. FkET Patterns and Related Ornament Fret patterns are not used extensively on these crosses, being found only on Ahenny North and Ahenny South. Two different kinds of fret pattern may be noted on Ahenny North. The first is a complex carpet of interlocking fret elements on the shaft of Face A (Fig 6a) (cf Allen and Anderson 1903, II, Nos. 973-84). The style of carving is distinctive since each pattern element is outlined in relief while the diamonds, which are used as fillers, are recessed. The effect is to obscure the actual form of the frets at the same time as giving the pattern a similar sharp metallic style</page><page sequence="15">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 19 xo\o\o\o g^ % 7 \&lt;&gt;\&lt;C&gt;\&lt;&gt;\&lt;C&gt; ^ [sf If a bed Fig 6 Repertoire of Fret Patterns and related ornament a Ahenny North Face A shaft, b Ahenny North Face A wheel arcs, c Ahenny South Faces B and D shaft, d Ahenny South Face B wheel arc. to the interlace and spirals on this cross. This stylistic feature is paralleled on Clonmacnois South (Henry 1965, PI. 85) and also on some of the Northern Pictish monuments, for example border patterns on Rosemarkie 1 and Nigg and a pattern on Tarbat 8 (Allen and Anderson, Figs 60A, 72A, 94; Henderson 1978, PL 3.2). The pattern itself has no close comparisons but similar carpets of frets are characteristic of Kilree and Killamery and there are further examples on the Gallen Priory slab (Henry 1933, Pis. 31, 17) and some of the more developed Pictish monuments, for example Rosemarkie 1 and Tarbat 8. The second type, which decorates the wheel arcs on Face A, is a border pattern (Fig 6b) (Allen and Anderson 1903, II, Nos. 932-54) consisting of a number of separate units placed side by side. It is possible that this practice of placing fret units side by side rather than interlocking them arose in order to keep the pattern simple. Certainly in this instance it has aided the skilful adaptation of the pattern to coincide with the curve of the wheel arc. The actual pattern elements are identical to those on the shaft; they are simply adapted to fulfil a different function. The fret patterns on the narrow faces of the shaft of Ahenny South are also made up of rather crudely carved single pattern units (Fig 6c). In addition on the lower wheel arc of Ahenny South Face B is an unusual crenellated pattern (Fig 6d) which has its closest affinities with fret ornament (Crawford 1926, Fig 7E) but is otherwise unparalleled in sculpture, metalwork or manuscripts. Step Patterns, Chequer Patterns and Related Designs None of this group have proper step patterns as, for example, the crosses at Kilree and Killamery (Henry 1933, PL 31) but there are two designs on Ahenny North (Fig 7a, b) consisting of a combination of square, rectangular, triangular and L-shaped blocks which are related to step patterns. The patterns on the shaft of Face C and the butt of Face A are very simply constructed, each block being outlined in relief to give a sharp, clear-cut effect. The parallels for these designs, unlike most of the abstract ornament on this cross, do not lie in chip-carving but with Hiberno-Saxon metalwork which makes use of millefiori and champleve enamel together with high relief</page><page sequence="16">20 NANCY EDWARDS IIIIII ||gg| 4r 0?0??? 1111II *MM $$$$??

TheEkerocrozier (Holmquist 1955) is a good example of an object which combines enamel work and chip-carving in the same way as Ahenny North does in stone. However the actual form of the Ahenny North shaft panel comes closest to that on the Copenhagen shrine (Mahr 1932, PI. 16). There are similar effects on the Moylough belt shrine and the handles of the Ardagh chalice (O'Kelly 1964, PI. 13; Henry 1965, PI. C). The panel on the butt also has parallels in manuscript illumination with f94V in the Lindisfarne Gospels. The fragmentary chequer pattern on the right-hand panel of the base of Lorrha West Face C and the related cruciform design on the upper step of the base of Ahenny North Face A (Fig 7c) are much simpler. They may be compared with small metalwork mounts decorated in enamel and millefiori mainly associated with hanging bowls and buckets, for example the escutcheons on the Miklebostad bowl and the Oseberg bucket (Petersen 1940, 100, 87). In addition there is an angular design at the end of the horizontal cross arm on Kilkieran West Face B (Fig 7d) which is related to chequer patterns. It consists of a square and a diagonal grid, one superimposed upon the other, giving the effect of diamond shapes slashed with triangles. A pattern of this kind seems to demonstrate the sculptor's knowledge of constructional grids even if he did not choose to employ them elsewhere. There may be a similar pattern on the right-hand panel of the base of Lorrha West Face A but it is now too weathered to reconstruct. The background to these designs probably also lies in metalwork, particularly millefiori patterns such as those on the Moylough belt-shrine (O'Kelly 1964, PL 30). However in this instance the closest comparisons are in manuscript illumination. There are exact parallels in the Lindisfarne Gospels (f95R) and similar designs in the Book of Durrow (Nordenfalk 1977, PI. 14). ZOOMORPHIC AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC ORNAMENT Ornament of this kind is little used on these crosses, being found only on Ahenny North, Ahenny South and Kilkieran West. Only three motifs are represented: pairs of confronted dragons, bird-like creatures with spiralled bodies and</page><page sequence="17">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 21 anthropomorphic interlace. In addition there are possible zoomorphic heads on the central boss of Ahenny North Face A. The pairs of confronted dragons on the crosshead of Ahenny South Face A clearly owe their origins to Hiberno-Saxon chip-carved metalwork. The best parallel is provided by the dragons on a bell(?) shrine, now in the National Museum, Dublin (Henry 1965, PL 90) which, like the Ahenny South dragons, have curled jaws. Their heads are hatched, either diagonally or with herring-bone ornament, and they have a spiral inset at the base of the neck. Further parallels may be made with the dragonesque quadrupeds on the St Germain plaques and the serpentine beasts on the Romfohjellen mount (Henry 1965, PL 90; Mahr 1932, Pis. 25-6). The Ahenny South dragons have a round object placed between their gaping jaws. It is not altogether clear what this is but it could represent a human head. The shrine from the National Museum has an orans figure in this position and there are variations on the St Germain plaques and the Ekero Crozier (Holmquist 1950). Dragons of this kind are also comparatively common on Irish sculpture. There is a very fine example on the crosshead of Killamery and there is a similar motif on a cross-slab from Gallen Priory (Henry 1965, Pis. 65, 67). Other examples include more serpentine dragons on a fragment from Kilkieran, a dragonesque motif in an identical position to those on Ahenny South at the top of the shaft on Bealin (Roe 1962, PL XIV, 2; Crawford 1927, PL XII). Similar dragons are also found in Pictland, for example Aberlemno 2, Monifieth and Dunfallandy (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Figs 227B, 242B, 305B). There are dragons with feline characteristics in the Book of Kells (Henry 1974, 206-7, PL 49). The bird-like creatures with spiralled bodies on the shaft of Kilkieran West Face A are closely related to the processions of birds and quadrupeds with spiralled bodies recently discussed by Hicks (1980,22-3; Edwards 1982,65-8) which are characteristic of the monuments at Clonmacnois and may be exemplified by the shaft panel on Bealin (Crawford 1927, Fig 8). The Kilkieran West motif is very much simpler but the spiralled body element is still quite clear. It may be compared with the border pattern on the Chi-Rho page of the Lichfield Gospels (Nordenfalk 1977, PL 23) which is decorated with pairs of quadrupeds with long spiralled bodies and crossed necks. The anthropomorphic interlace on the shaft of Ahenny North Face A may also be compared with similar motifs amongst the Clonmacnois monuments, and particularly with a panel on the Banagher shaft (Hicks 1980, 19-22; Fig 5; Edwards 1982,68-72). However, unlike Banagher the men on Ahenny North do not have long hair or beards and they are not reminiscent of manuscript representations. Instead they have more in common with other sculptural panels, for example the Market Cross, Kells (Roe 1966, 42; Henry 1933, Fig 46d) and Meigle 26 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 319). The only other parallel is a rare example in metalwork, a mount from Togherstown, Co. Westmeath, where the three crouched figures also have short hair and are beardless (Mahr 1932, PL 19.4). Rgural Iconography Figural scenes on these crosses are confined to the bases and therefore they always appear subordinate to the abstract ornament. On Ahenny North and South all the</page><page sequence="18">22 NANCY EDWARDS large base panels are figural but on Kilkieran West, Lorrha West and Seir Kieran there is a mixture of figural and abstract ornament. This mixture may be compared with Clonmacnois South. The figural panels on Ahenny North are relatively well preserved but the bases of other crosses have suffered from severe weathering and therefore the iconography is not always easily identifiable. Seir Kieran Face D in particular at first appears completely incoherent but on close examination in good oblique light several scenes may be identified (Fig 8). It is also evident by examining old photographs (Henry 1933, Pis. 34-5, 37) that the carving on Ahenny South has deteriorated considerably in recent years. The figural scenes represented may be divided into three different types. Firstly, there are scenes which are undoubtedly scriptural. Secondly, there are scenes which are unlikely to be scriptural but which do appear to have some kind of religious significance. Lastly, there are panels where the iconography, chiefly hunting scenes, seems likely to have some religious symbolism or allegorical significance, although a secular interpretation is equally possible. The iconography on the base of Ahenny North is complex and problematical and for this reason it has given rise to much discussion (Sexton 1946,49-50). For example the identity of Face A (Fig lid) has been the subject of several fanciful speculations. Porter (1931, 22) suggested that it showed Cormac mac Cuillennain, a bishop of Cashel at the turn of the tenth century, and six other bishops who were his supporters. Hickey (1955) interpreted it as one of a cycle of scenes depicting episodes &gt;&gt;/ ro pw \ /-?-\ Fig 8 Seir Kieran Face D (not to scale) a The Fall, b The Three Children in the Fiery Furnace, c Bird, d David presenting the head of Goliath to King Saul (?) (after Roe), e The Sacrifice of Isaac, f Winged(?) Horses.</page><page sequence="19">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 23 from the life of Art, son of Conn and King of Tara, who, according to the Book of Leinster, died c. 195 AD. In local tradition it is associated with the story of seven bishops who were murdered in the area (Stokes 1901,576ff; Henry 1945). But, more likely than any of these is Helen Roe's suggestion (1962, 19; Henry 1965, 151) that the panel depicts Christ's Mission to the Apostles. There are other possible parallels on the right-hand side of the base of Ahenny South Face C (Roe 1962, 23-4), now unverifiable due to weathering, and on the base of Clonmacnois West (Henry 1933, PL 37; 2). Christ's Mission to the Apostles, together with similar scenes showing Christ enthroned with the Apostles or teaching them, are common in Early Christian iconography. For example, on the late fourth century sarcophagus of Stilicho(?) from Milan, Christ is shown standing face on, with six Apostles seated either side looking towards Him (Beckwith 1979, Fig 30). He may also be shown standing face on with the Apostles to either side placed between pillars (Gough 1973, Fig 89). There are also examples on the Gaulish sarcophagi where Christ is shown face on standing or seated while the Apostles, frequently standing in ones or twos under arches, process towards Him (Le Blant 1886, Pis. 19,22). Therefore this panel seems to be a version of Christ's Mission to the Apostles adapted to the Early Christian Irish environment, the Apostles being represented as ecclesiastics with croziers, dressed in long robes and cloaks with hoods. The form of the cloaks suggests that they are wearing a kind of chasuble called a casula, a common form of outdoor dress for clergy and monks from the fifth to eighth centuries (Norris 1949, 60-2), being retained in some places into the Carolingian period (Cabrol and Leclercq 1907-53, III.l, 1192). Ecclesiastics wearing similar apparel are also quite common on the Pictish slabs, for example St Vigeans 7 (Allen and Anderson 1903, II, 407; III, Fig 278). Ahenny North Face C (Fig lie) has been variously identified as Adam naming the animals (Crawford 1909, 259) or a hermit in retreat (Henry 1965, 152-3) as well as other less credible attributions (Porter 1931, 12 note; Hickey 1955, 121). The first, better entitled the Garden of Eden, is by far the most likely even though Roe (1962, 14-5) was doubtful because the figure is clothed and the beasts have much in common with oriental decorative motifs and bestiary illustrations. The best parallel is a Genesis Cycle scene from the Bamburg Bible, Tours, dated to the second quarter of the ninth century (Beckwith 1969,61, Fig50). This scene, which may be derived from a late antique manuscript, depicts God showing Adam the animals in the Garden of Eden. On the left is a tree. To the right of this God is shown in long robes and a halo pointing to the animals. In the centre are a variety of animals and birds and to the right Adam is shown in profile facing left. Perhaps the clothed figure on Ahenny North may be interpreted as God rather than Adam who may have been left out owing to lack of space. A second parallel may be cited with a late fourth century North Italian ivory diptych in the Museo Nazionale, Florence (Gaborit-Chopin 1978, Fig 13). Here Adam is shown reclining, grasping a tree in his left hand, and viewing a group of animals set before him. The iconography on Faces B and D is more problematical. The former (Fig lib) is clearly a funeral procession but to whom it relates is unknown. Porter (1931, 112) associated it with the funeral of Cormac mac Cuillenain who died in 908, a theory</page><page sequence="20">24 NANCY EDWARDS which is untenable because of the form of the abstract ornament on this cross. Roe (1962, 22) suggested it could show the funeral of a saint or King Saul who was killed by the Philistines, an episode from the David Cycle. All one can say is that this scene may provide a valuable illustration of a funeral procession as it may have been conducted in early medieval Ireland. The three leading figures because of their garb and attributes are ecclesiastics. The second carries a processional cross, itself a valuable testimony to the use of such crosses in Ireland. The headless figure slung over the horse or ass and preyed on by crows or ravens is a pictorial example of events described in Celtic heroic literature such as the Tain (Kinsella 1969, 238) and the Gododdin (Jackson 1969, 41, 99, 117, 126). The decapitation of the slain on the battlefield is accepted as Celtic custom and Ross (1967, 122, 61-126) has fully explored the pagan religious significance of the cult of the head. Ravens and crows are also connected with pagan Celtic religion, particularly with a trio of Irish war goddesses, one of whom is frequently called badb or 'crow' after thr form she took while another, the Morrigan, is associated with ravens (Ross 1967, 219, 244, 294). These goddesses in their bird forms were prophetic of death or disaster on the battlefield and in the same guise are associated with severed heads (Ross 1967, 247, 257, 244, 122). Thus the decapitated body preyed on by crows or ravens on Ahenny North may indicate a survival into the early Christian period of earlier but deep rooted beliefs. Both the headless body slung over the horse or ass and birds devouring bodies are found elsewhere in Hiberno-Saxon art. The former appears in a simplified version on the crosshead at Dromiskin, county Louth (Henry 1965, PI. 82; Roe 1954,113), and in Pictland on St Vigeans 25 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 296) where it is not entirely clear whether the body is decapitated. The latter is found in the Aberlemno 2 battle scene (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 227B) where the fallen warrior is preyed on by an eagle-like bird and crow-like birds are also depicted on the curious Insular Crucifixion in the Wurzburg Gospels (Wiirzburg Universitat bibl. M.p.th. f7V; Alexander 1978, PI. 265). The figural panels on Faces B and D have both been connected with the cult of relics (Henry 1965, 152; Roe 1962, 16, 45, Fig 6). For the latter (Fig lid), a procession with horsemen and a chariot, this association seems slightly more plausible. Roe compared it with a sixth (?) century Byzantine ivory showing a translation of relics in Constantinople now in Trier Cathedral Treasury (Beckwith 1979, Fig 74). This shows a procession of men with a cross-bearer, set against the background of a crowded street, leading a chariot with two occupants, one clearly holding a house-shaped shrine. Unfortunately no shrine is visible on Ahenny North Face D, although it is known that in Ireland relics were taken round for exhibition (commutatio) (Hughes 1966,167-9) so the parallel will remain unproven. In addition Harbison (1969, 53-4) has suggested that this panel may follow on from the funerary scene on Face B, although the two panels are not adjacent, and may represent the mourners accompanying the procession. However, whatever the precise meaning of the scene, it is undoubtedly of religious significance as the leading horseman is a cleric. The form of the chariot has led to a considerable amount of discussion since, apart from the addition of spoked wheels, it resembles a reconstruction of the chariot argued to have come into use in Ireland during the Iron Age (Harbison 1971, 173-4; Greene 1972, 60). It has also been shown (Greene 1972, 60; Harbison 1969, 50-1)</page><page sequence="21">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 25 that such chariots were not only used in war; they were rather a method of transport for the upper classes, kings, nobles and, in the early medieval period, ecclesiastics also. Indeed it is recorded in the Annals of Ulster (s.a. 1020) that a chariot was still used by the Abbot of Armagh. Similar processions with horsemen and chariots are also found on other Irish crosses where they usually appear on the base. The version on Kells South seems to be a simplification of that on Ahenny North (Roe 1966, PL IV). Two horsemen, a dog and a chariot are shown but on a very much smaller scale. There are other chariot scenes on Killamery and Clonmacnois West (Henry 1933, Pis. 31, 34.3). In Pictland there is a single example of a chariot of more complex structure with a canopy on Meigle 10 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 344). On a more general note, Harbison (1978, 288ff) has tried to demonstrate strong affinities between the style of the figural panels on Ahenny North and English bone carving as exemplified by the Franks Casket. Both have wide-ranging iconography and a sense of horror vacui but it is not possible to compare them more closely. The craftsman who made the Franks Casket seems to have been subject to Late Antique Mediterranean influences especially from ivories (for example the Brescia casket), manuscripts and sarcophagi but has adapted the iconography to suit Anglo-Saxon taste (Becker 1973; Webster 1982). The sculptor of Ahenny North was probably subject to similar Mediterranean influences which he adapted to a more Irish milieu. Several Old Testament scenes may be identified on Seir Kieran Face D: the Fall, the Sacrifice of Isaac and the Three Children in the Fiery Furnace (Fig 8). The figures in the top left-hand corner have now been almost entirely obliterated but Roe, who helped excavate the base in 1937, when it was apparently less weathered (Cunningham 1976, 68) suggested that (1949, 51, Fig 7) this scene was David, on the right, handing the head of Goliath to King Saul. There is no evidence for a representation of Jonah and the Whale as Henry has suggested (1965, 147), Roe (1962, 23-4) identified other Old Testament scenes on Ahenny South. The panel on the left-hand side of Face C may show Daniel in the Lions' Den but the panel in a similar position on Face B, which she suggested was The Fall, is now completely lost. It seems possible that the panel in the bottom right-hand corner of the base of Lorrha West Face C could be a misunderstood version of Daniel in the Lions' Den with the figure of Daniel at one end. The beasts are probably lions; they are clearly not horses as Henry has suggested (1933, 115; 1940, 105), and the idea that Noah summoning the animals into the Ark is being depicted seems most unlikely as there is no indication of the Ark. Representations of the Fall, the Sacrifice of Isaac, the Three Children in the Fiery Furnace and Daniel in the Lions' Den are all common on the Irish crosses (Fig 9) but the closest parallels for those on Seir Kieran Face D are provided by Kells South (Roe 1966, PL II). The Fall on Kells South is accompanied by the Death of Abel and it seems possible that this may once have been represented to the right of the Fall on Seir Kieran also. The Children in the Furnace on Seir Kieran is a rather mangled version of that on Kells South where the two torch-bearers are placed one on either side of the children who are grouped under the protection of the angel's wings; on Seir Kieran there are three torch-bearers and they are all to the left of the children. The Sacrifice of Isaac is also very similar on both crosses.</page><page sequence="22">26 NANCY EDWARDS The placing of such scenes on the base may be compared with Clonmacnois South and Bray (Henry 1965,147; Conway 1975,53-4). These four scenes, together with Noah's Ark, which is found elsewhere on Irish sculpture (Fig 9) all belong to the Help of God iconographic cycle. Their use goes right back to the beginnings of Christianity. The Fall is dipicted from a very early date because this was what made the Redemption necessary. There are early examples in the Catacomb of Januarius in Naples and in the Baptistry at Dura (Gough 1973, 33, Fig 27). Noah's Ark, the Sacrifice of Isaac, the Three Children in the Fiery Furnace and Daniel in the Lions' Den, all scenes of deliverance, are frequently found either grouped or singly in the catacomb paintings and on sarcophagi both in Italy and Gaul (Gough 1973, Figs 29-31, 34-5; Le Blant 1886, 93). Other scenes of deliverance not found in Ireland are also depicted, particularly scenes from the Life of Jonah and the Accusation of Susannah (Gough 1973, Figs 34, 36-7; Beckwith 1979, Fig 10). The reason why these scenes of deliverance were so popular in the funerary context is made clear when the liturgical background is examined (Le Blant 1878). The episodes illustrated are part of the ordo commendationis animae, the prayer for deliverance said to the dying which was adapted by Cyprian of Antioch in the second century AD from a Jewish prayer recited on fast days (Michel 1902). The earliest version of the ordo commendationis animae in Latin survives in the eleventh century Troyes Pontifical (Troyes Bibl. Municipale Cod. 2272; Flower 1954, 92; Vogel 1975, 205). However three versions of a similar prayer for deliverance are also known from Ireland. They have become separated from the ordo commendationis animae and in two cases they have been translated into Irish but their ultimate roots in the Latin ordo remain perfectly clear. In the Irish context they seem to be used 'as a general apotropaic formula against all evil' (Flower 1954, 92). The first version forms the latter part of the Epilogue to the Felire Oengusso (Martyrology of Oengus) (Stokes 1905) dated c. 800. The second is Hymnus S. Colmani Mic UiCluasaigh, a prayer for protection against plague from the Liber Hymnorum (Bernard and Atkinson 1898,1, 26-9; II, 14-5) which linguistically is probably contemporary with the Felire Oengusso (Flower 1954,92). The prayer is followed by a Latin collect which suggests that it was used liturgically. The third example, in Latin rather than Irish, is also liturgical since it forms the preface to the Ordo Missae (Warner 1915, fl2) which survives in the Stowe Missal (Dublin RIA Ms. D.II 3), an early service book possibly associated with some monastery in Tipperary founded by St. Ruadan of Lorrha (Warren 1881, 198ff). Most of the service book has been ascribed on liturgical grounds to the ninth and tenth centuries. The Antiphonary of Bangor and the Old English Exodus and Daniel may also indicate the importance of the deliverance theme (McLoughlin 1969). It is interesting to note that the emphasis in Daniel is on the narrative portions of the story including Daniel's struggles and deliverance from the Lions' Den and the deliverance of the Three Children from the Fiery Furnace. These texts suggest, as Henry (1967,144) has already stated, that various stories of deliverance would have been familiar to the Irish churchman and generally recognisable in the iconographic context. However, that sculptors were actually illustrating such prayers seems unlikely as only the same few scenes are repeated over and over again and these are the ones also found in the Early Christian art of Italy and Gaul. The precise models for their representation in Irish art are nonetheless</page><page sequence="23">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 27 The Sacrifice The Three Daniel Noah's Fall of Children in Ark Isaac the Furnace Ahenny South ? ?

Although popular in the early days of Christianity they seem to fall into disuse during the seventh and eighth centuries. Radford (1977, 114) suggested that the insular world could have received such iconography in the fifth and sixth centuries and kept it alive on wooden sculpture until its appearance in stone. This is most unlikely. The idea that Irish churchmen visiting the Continent or Rome brought back early ivories or other portable objects, or had at least seen paintings or sarcophagi with these subjects depicted on them, is far more plausible. If Roe's interpretation (1949, 51) of David presenting the head of Goliath to King Saul on Seir Kieran is correct, its association with Help of God scenes is not entirely anomalous as God's aid is sought in both the Felire Oengusso (1483-4) and the Hymnus S. Colmani for the deliverance of David from Goliath. This aspect of the David Cycle is not paralleled elsewhere in Ireland but the act of presenting a severed head, as we have seen, might well have continued to appeal to the Irish mind. The right-hand panel on Face B and both panels on Face D of the base of Ahenny South are severely weathered but from the fragmentary carvings which survive and by the examination of old photographs it is clear that they show hunting scenes (Henry 1933, Pis. 37, 35). The aim of the sculptor seems to have been to fill every available space but a coherent picture is not necessarily created in so doing. On the left-hand panel of Face D the course of the hunt has been reversed; the bears are now pursuing the horsemen. This kind of hunting scene is represented on many Irish crosses, usually on the base, and, like the hunting scenes on the Clonmacnois monuments (Hicks 1980, 13-6), they fit into the same milieu as those in Pictland, although no particular parallels may be cited. However, the bears on Face D are unusual. They are not paralleled elsewhere in Ireland but in Pictland there are three bears on Meigle 26 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 318B), although here they are not part of a hunting scene. In Ireland the bear was extinct before the beginning of the historic period (Harting 1880, 16ff) but it would still have been possible to hunt bears in Britain during the eighth century. It is not impossible that the sculptor was acquainted with wild bears but it seems more likely that he was drawing on a foreign model, perhaps some Roman venatio or amphitheatre scene which frequently include bears (Dorigo 1971, PL 148). On the base panels of Kilkieran West Face C there are eight horsemen (Fig 14). On Lorrha West this motif has been simplified to form a procession of miniature horses on the second step of the base on all four faces; there is a similar procession on Clonmacnois South (Henry 1965, PL 84). They may perhaps be compared with a procession of four horsemen on the base of the Market Cross, Kells (Roe 1966, PL VII) but those are much more spirited. Porter (1931, 23) identified them with the seven bishops legend but this is most unlikely; they should in fact be regarded as a motif which is used in a similar way to the hunting scene. Single horsemen and groups of two or three are a common motif on Pictish Class II and III slabs where they are usually found on the backs. This is not a closely knit group since the horsemen sport a great variety of attributes and cannot be closely compared with any of the Irish examples but their popularity in both Ireland and Pictland may reflect a common love of horses and horsemanship. The stylistic detail of foreshortening the rider's body due to lack of space found on Kilkieran West is a characteristic feature of many of the Pictish horsemen, for example St Madoes (Allen and Anderson 1903, III,</page><page sequence="25">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 29 Fig 309B), and it is also found in the Book of Kells (f89R). On Seir Kieran Face A four marching men holding spears are shown confronting a horseman. This is the only example of a battle scene in Ireland although there may be armed men on the base of Clonmacnois West (Henry 1933, PI. 37.2). Again, the parallels are Pictish: the second register of the battle scene on Aberlemno 2 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 227B) provides a good comparison. There are further examples on a fragment from Dull in Perthshire and Sueno's stone, a rather late Class III monument (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Figs 329,156A; Henderson 1978, 53). Both the origins and the significance of hunting scenes and related iconography are difficult to ascertain though, since they are found on crosses, one would expect a Christian meaning. Bailey (1977, 68-71) has studied the probable religious significance of harts pursued by hounds. The stag was early adopted by Christian commentators as a symbol of Baptism or Christ Crucified and it is also popularised in Christian Encyclopedias and Bestiaries for its enmity against serpents (Reau 1955, 82; Cabrol and Leclercq 1907-53, II, 2, 3302). Bailey has also emphasised the importance of the hart and hound in the Psalms, an essential part of monastic liturgy. In particular, he has drawn attention to illustrations in the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter which show a stag pursued by hounds representing evil. In this light it seems likely that Irish hunting scenes had similar religious connotations and that the ultimate source was Christian Mediterranean art as, for example, in the Early Christian sarcophagi of Aquitaine (Le Blant 1886, Nos. 88, 95, PI. 23; Fossard 1953, 117, PI. 2), where hunting scenes are frequently interspersed with overtly Christian icongraphy. Iconoclasm in Byzantium brought a revival in classical mythology, including scenes of the chase (Dalton 1911, 15), and this influence reached Italy during the eighth century where it may be exemplified by hunting scenes at San Saba in Rome and Civita Castellana (Hubert etal. 1969, 257). However, the idea that some of the hunting scenes and related iconography may have derived from secular models cannot be entirely ruled out. Irish Christianity was extraordinarily tolerant of secular learning (Hughes 1966, 154) and there seems no reason why hunting scenes, which may have had little Christian significance, could not have become a popular motif. The Irish love of hunting is illustrated, for example, in the early eighth century law tract, Crith Gablach, where sport, one aspect of which was hunting, is considered an essential part of noble life (MacNeill 1923, 304). The adoption of scenes showing warfare on the crosses could also reflect the importance of fighting in early Irish society as exemplified by the Tain (Kinsella 1969). Animals of the hunt are an important aspect of Celtic religion. Boars, stags horses and perhaps bears are frequently represented in pagan Celtic art (Finlay 1973, 70, 95; Ross 1967, 297ff). Henderson (1967, 134-7) has also hinted at the possible importance of embroideries illustrating heroic deeds, although the only actual survival, the Oseberg ship tapestry (Jones 1968, PI. 21), is Scandinavian rather than Irish. Roman secular hunting scenes are also a possible source. In Roman Britain Toynbee (1964,408-9) has pointed out the popularity of Nene Valley ware which was frequently decorated with hunting scenes. There is also evidence that Roman hunting scenes reached Ireland. A fourth century silver dish fragment from the Balline hoard, county Limerick, shows three horsemen who are clearly part of a large hunting scene (Bateson 1973, 73-4).</page><page sequence="26">30 NANCY EDWARDS Therefore, while hunting scenes and related iconography probably owe much to Christian symbolism, the influence of secular models cannot be excluded. It may simply be that Christian hunting scenes are frequently represented because of the popularity of hunting. In general the closest parallels for the figural scenes on the Ossory crosses are Pictish. Firstly, the iconography is detached from the actual form of the cross. On the Ossory crosses it is found on the base and on the Pictish slabs the majority is confined to the back or is placed to either side of the crosses on the front. Secondly, the figural panels on the Ossory crosses and the Pictish slabs, for example Shandwick (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 69), are composed in a similar way. Animals and figures are placed to cover the entire area available, even if it means placing an animal vertically as on the base of Ahenny North Face C. Scriptural scenes are treated in the same manner. The episodic character of the David Cycle on the St Andrews sarcophagus (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Fig 365) may be compared with the Help of God scenes of Seir Kieran Face D. Thirdly, stylistic details are common to both groups. The preference for the figure in profile is only rarely broken in Pictland, for example the female rider on Hilton of Cadbol, Daniel on Meigle 2 and David on the St Andrews sarcophagus (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Figs 59, 31 IB). The only face-on representation on the Ossory crosses is the central figure on Ahenny North Face A. Attempts at perspective are also similar. On Hilton of Cadbol two mounted figures placed side by side are shown by doubling the line round the horse's head and legs; this is indicated in an identical fashion on the horses pulling the chariot on Ahenny North Face D. The general similarities in the subject-matter between the Pictish and Ossory monuments have already been pointed out. The only real difference is that the Scriptural iconographic repertoire is narrower in Pictland. For example, Help of God scenes are rarely shown and they are not grouped together. Daniel in the Lions' Den is depicted on Inchinnan 3, Meigle 2, Newton Woods and St Vigeans 14 (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Figs 478A, 311B, 481, 285A) and there are three examples of Jonah and the Whale, which is not found in Ireland, at Dunfallandy and Woodwray (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Figs 305C, 258C). However, the repertoire in Dalriada does seem more similar. For example, the sacrifice of Isaac is found on Kildalton, Keills and St Martin's Cross, Iona (Allen and Anderson 1903, III, Figs410A, 408, 397A). Therefore it is clear that the sculptors of the Ossory crosses and the Scottish sculpture were working in a similar milieu and drawing upon similar sources. What these sources were is more difficult to ascertain but they may have included a variety of portable Christian objects, for example manuscripts and ivories, as well as indigenous material, although the latter may merely have affected the choice of what was drawn from other sources. The Dating of the Crosses The only way of dating these crosses is on art historical grounds and in the past this had led to widely differing suggestions. Sexton (1946, 7-8) recognised the influence of metalwork on these crosses but implausibly compared it with the decoration on the Cross of Cong dated c. 1123 (Wilson and Klindt-Jensen 1966,156-7). While it is true that many technical elements used on earlier metalwork are still present on this</page><page sequence="27">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 31 object, the ornament, in Viking Urnes style, is completely different. Porter's (1931, 112) suggestion of a terminus post quern of 908, the year in which Cormac mac Cuillenain, whose funeral procession he identified on Ahenny North Face B, was murdered, has already been demonstrated as untenable. More recently Smyth (1979, 284-8), again disregarding the abstract ornament, has attempted to examine the Irish crosses in terms of the political background and has consequently argued that they date to the end of the ninth century, when the kingdom of Ossory was particularly powerful. However the majority of other writers following Henry have fixed upon an eighth century date because of the similarity of the ornament to Hiberno-Saxon metalwork (Henry 1940,103; 1965,141; Roe 1962,8-9), although Crawford (1926,5) believed they were slightly later. As the preceding discussion has shown the closest comparisons for both the form and ornament of these crosses are undoubtedly with Hiberno-Saxon metalwork. As Henry (1940, 103) said, 'they are first and foremost enlargements into stone of metalwork crosses'. Harbison (1978, 283ff) has enlarged upon this, drawing attention to the Rupertus Cross of probable Anglo-Saxon origin as a possible parallel for a metalwork cross which may have been the source of inspiration for the Ahenny crosses. These comparisons are, however, very superficial. Nevertheless it does seem likely that the sculptor of Ahenny North was heavily dependent on some metalwork prototype, perhaps something akin to the processional cross carved on Face B, because so many skeuomorphic metalwork elements are retained. This view is reinforced if it is imagined that the cross was once painted. There is now no visible evidence that the Irish sculpture was painted but this cross, decked out in the colours of gilding and enamelwork, would surely have appeared as a gigantic golden cross encrusted with insets of gold and jewels. Indeed, it may be suggested that the ultimate origins of this cross could lie in the crux gemmata, the cross which was set up by Theodosius on the site of Calvary in Jerusalem in 417 and which was later encased in gold and jewels (Swanton 1970,44; Roe 1965,221-2). A copy of this survives in an early fifth century mosaic in Santa Pudenziana in Rome which shows Christ enthroned against a Jerusalem skyline dominated by a cross encrusted with gems (Gough 1973, Fig 69). The closest comparisons for the metalwork motifs used on the Ossory crosses, particularly Ahenny North and Ahenny South, are those carried out in a chip-carved technique or decorated with enamel, millefiori insets or glass studs. There is one major example of an object incorporating both techniques, the Ekero crozier (Holmquist 1955; Henry 1965, 104-5; Werner 1978). More often the two are not intermingled but the comparisons cited have been with objects of the highest technical achievement, for example the Ardagh chalice, the St Germain plaques and the Derrynavlan paten stand. These comparisons with Hiberno-Saxon metalwork would suggest the Ossory crosses are of a similar date. It is impossible to pinpoint the dating of this metalwork and so on these grounds the date of the Ossory crosses may be ascribed to any time during the eighth or early ninth centuries. As Stevenson has hinted (1956, 91-2), a more profitable approach may lie in the comparisons which have been made between the Ossory crosses and sculpture in Pictland and Dalriada. It has been demonstrated that the Ossory crosses show many affinities with 'Boss style' monuments and some of the more developed Class II slabs</page><page sequence="28">32 NANCY EDWARDS (Stevenson 1955, 117-23). Indeed, there are enough similarities to suggest an approximately contemporary dating. Stevenson (1955) has suggested c. 800 for the masterpieces of Pictish 'Boss style' and Henderson (1978,49) has seen Rosemarkie 1 as a stone 'that looks forward to the last phase of Pictish sculpture', that is the ninth century monuments. It would therefore seem likely that many of the influences detectable on the Ossory crosses could have originated in Scotland, perhaps reaching Ireland via Iona which was in 'the vanguard of artistic work at the time' (Stevenson 1956, 91). However, the traffic cannot all have been passing in one direction and it seems possible that the interplay of the ornamental repertoires of the two regions may be an equally valid concept. Therefore, in view of the Pictish parallels, it may be suggested that the Ossory crosses could date to the end of the eighth or the beginning of the ninth century. Hicks (1980, 26-32) has suggested a similar date of c. 800 for the Clonmacnois monuments and that they and the Ossory crosses may be regarded as two different but broadly contemporary groups, the former more dependent on manuscript models (Edwards 1982, 91), the latter on metalwork. Both show parallels with Scottish sculpture but is is interesting to note that the Clonmacnois group show more comparisons with the early Class II Pictish slabs (Edwards 1982,90) while the Ossory crosses are closer to the later Class II and 'Boss style' monuments. The Ossory crosses also show links with other groups of Irish sculpture. The similarities in the layout and ornamental repertoire of Kilree and Killamery may be seen in the light of their geographical proximity. However close comparisons have also been suggested with Clonmacnois South where, since the metalwork parallels are not paramount, it is probably the receiver rather than the innovator. This cross also shows links with Kells South, undoubtedly a ninth century cross, as does the iconography of Seir Kieran. Furthermore, some kind of relative chronology may be traced amongst the Ossory crosses. The man who carved Ahenny North was a skilled and gifted sculptor who knew how to use the influence of metalworking techniques and motifs to their best advantage. Ahenny South, though of inferior quality, has so much in common with Ahenny North that it must be of a similar date. However, on Kilkieran West, Seir Kieran, Lorrha East and Lorrha West the carving is less accomplished and, more important, the Hiberno-Saxon metalwork origins of many of the motifs have been largely lost. However, comparisons can be made between, for example, the loss of the sharp chip-carved effect, the infrequency of spiral ornament and the inferior quality of the plaitwork, with later ninth century metalwork such as phase 1 of the Kells crozier (MacDermott 1955). The scriptural iconography on Seir Kieran has also been compared with Kells South. These factors tend to suggest that these monuments are later than the Ahenny crosses but the precise time-span is difficult to gauge. Kilkieran East, although it is undecorated, may be classed with the rest of the Ossory group. The cross is not unfinished as the stone has been carefully dressed. It does, however, seem possible that decoration could have been painted rather than carved, thereby producing a similar, though two-dimensional effect to the ornament on the other crosses. The survival of this cross is interesting as it shows a parallel tradition to the complex carved crosses, of simpler, less ambitious projects.</page><page sequence="29">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 33 Fig 10 Ahenny North a Face A b FaceB c FaceC d FaceD</page><page sequence="30">a b c d Fig 11 Ahenny North, details of base a Face A b FaceB c FaceC d FaceD &gt; O rn a &gt; a GO</page><page sequence="31">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 35 a c d Fig 12 Ahenny South a Face A b FaceB c FaceC d FaceD</page><page sequence="32">36 NANCY EDWARDS a c '"'b Fig 13 Kilkieran West a Face A b Face B c Face C, crosshead and shaft d Face D</page><page sequence="33">a fillllfliaP&lt;llll^ ' c Fig 14 a Kilkieran West, Face C base, left panel b Kilkieran West, Face C base, right panel c Kilkieran East o o c/3 ffl CO o o O O 3S O o CO GO O</page><page sequence="34">38 NANCY EDWARDS a c  Fig 15 Lorrha East a Face A b FaceB c FaceC d FaceD</page><page sequence="35">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 39 a d Fig 16 Lorrha West a Face A b FaceB c FaceC d FaceD</page><page sequence="36">a c b d Fig 17 Seir Kieran a Face A b FaceB c FaceC d FaceD &gt; n &gt;&lt; w o &gt; a CO</page><page sequence="37">CROSSES FROM THE KINGDOM OF OSSORY 41 Acknowledgements I would like to thank Ann Hamlin and Jim Lang who encouraged me to write this article, Huw Pryce for reading and correcting the various drafts, June Hughes for typing them and John Illsley for printing the photographs.
