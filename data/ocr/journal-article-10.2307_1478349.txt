The Yearbook of the Imperial Theaters Roland John Wiley As Russian ballet has become more important as a subject of historical inquiry, western scholars have become increasingly aware of the need to consult the rich bibliography of appropriate source material in the Russian language. Of all the eras addressed in this extensive literature, the late imperial period has quite understandably cast the most powerful spell over us. It was then, of course, that Tchaikovsky's music, Petipa's choreography, and the artistry of many still-remembered ballerinas first graced the stage. Like ourselves, the contemporaries of that period were conscious of the wealth of talent around them and sought to record their impressions of it. As witness to this we have the histories of Konstantin Skalkovsky, Alexander Pleshchejev and Sergei Khudekov, to name but three. More im- pressive than any of these works and a reference that their authors used, is the monumental Year- book of the Imperial Theaters [Ezhegodnik Im- peratorskikh Teatrov]-unquestionably the richest single source of information concerning the late imperial stage. In the following pages I shall describe this periodical and point out its value to ballet historians.1 1. History of the publication. The Yearbook was published for some twenty- five years, commencing with the 1890-91 season and ceasing in 1915.2 It was one result of the swell of enthusiasm for theater in late nineteenth century Russia-an aggressive, zestful enthusiasm that sur- passed anything like it before. The dance historian must realize, however, that spoken drama had always been the most popular form of theater among Russian audiences as a whole, with opera This is the first in a series of articles describing Russian-language histories and other important references concerning the imperial ballet in Russia. Roland John Wiley graduated from Stanford University with honors in music in 1963. After a period of military service he entered the graduate program in the history of music at Harvard University, where he earned the M.A. degree in 1970 and the Ph.D. in 1974. Currently Assistant Professor at the School of Music, University of Michigan, he has lectured and written about Russian ballet, and is writing a book on the ballets of Tchaikovsky. 30 I</page><page sequence="2">next and ballet third.3 The Yearbook reflects this precedence in its editorial policy, and yet without the support of powerful figures in the dramatic theater this valuable source for ballet might never have come into existence at all. In particular three such figures proposed the Yearbook to the Director of the Imperial Theaters: Anatoloy Molchanov, who was to become its editor in the second year of publication; Peter Gnedich, playwright and later manager of the state drama troupe in St. Petersburg; and Vladimir Pogozhev, a historian and also an official of the St. Petersburg theaters. The impetus for its creation thus came not from above, as might have been expected from a publication of the state, but rather from within. The goals of the Yearbook were specified in a preface to the first volume: 1) To give priority to objective reporting criticism (indeed, adverse criticism of state tutions could hardly be tolerated in a publication); over insti- state 2) To recreate each season by means of des- criptive text and pictures, supplying the future historian in this annual review with data "the authenticity of which is guaranteed by having been taken from an official source." The first issue reflects considerable efforts to meet the challenge of this second goal.4 For example, it contained 174 illustrations, an un- precedented number for a Russian theater periodical of the time.5 Included among them were several of Sleeping Beauty, which for its success was made an exception to the editorial policy of representing only works first produced or mounted anew in a given season (it had been produced the winter before the pilot issue). It must be acknowledged, however, that the technical quality of the illustrations in the early volumes of the Yearbook is low. A favored method of presentation, which continued until the 1899-1900 issue, involved collage, vignette, and other artifices which would permit an unframed picture to mingle freely with text, or a subject to break out of its frame-at one point Pierina Legnani smiles at us through a drawn-in tear in the page! Many illustrations were engraved from photographs or drawings, a technique long employed by Russian publishers. A particularly ugly experiment involving multiple tints was tried in the 1896-97 issue. In an effect similar to that of screens attached to television receivers in that medium's infancy, colors were layered and arbitrary. Hence one finds illus- trations that are brown across the top, grey in the middle and blue across the bottom, regardless of whether these shades were appropriate to the subject matter. These methods, together with the generally low standard of photographic reproduction in the first eight volumes, suggest the primitive state of the illustrator's art, the editors' view of chic, or possibly a reluctance to pay for higher quality. Whatever the reason, illustrations in the early issues can be a source of irritation for scholars bent on duplicating them. As might be expected in a new publication, the first issues show signs of the editors' striving toward a standard format. Many features of Volume I were retained throughout the Yearbook's effective life,6 others were abandoned after a few years, and yet others were retained with modifications. Attempts at standardization were intensifed under Anatoly Molchanov. In some ways the best editor the Yearbook ever had-free of bias and committed to promptness-he introduced many refinements and two new features. Beginning with Volume II the Yearbook contained historical studies, at first part of the main issue but from Volume IV onward located in separately-issued supplements. Russian drama retained its precedence in these studies, but not to the exclusion of dance (for a list of titles see Appendix B). Second, with Volume III we find the first advertisements in the Yearbook. Besides show- ing a willingness to solicit financial support, these have a certain charm and topical relevance for modern readers. In 1894, as today, women were urged to test the wonders of balsam shampoo. The first major changes in the Yearbook came in 1899, coincident with the appointment of a new editor. In that year Ivan Vsevolozhsky retired as Director of Imperial Theaters after seventeen years of competent, at times inspired service. His nephew Sergei Volkonsky succeeded him. A prince of one of Russia's oldest families, Volkonsky was a cultivated, dynamic, innovative man. From the beginning he showed little sympathy for the lethargic bureaucracy to which he had fallen heir, and the bureaucracy reciprocated his feelings with constant frictions. His tenure, like those of other impatient, more brilliant than rational men, was short and eventful. Molchanov, apparently among the disenchanted, resigned, and in the appointment of a successor Volkonsky demonstrated the daring side of his leadership. To be new editor of the Yearbook he chose a kindred spirit, an impetuous young man from the provinces-named Diaghilev. Sergei Diaghilev's fame was ascendant at that time, his reputation associated not with ballet but with pictorial art. He had sponsored his first exhibition two years before, and co-founded the journal Mir Iskusstva a year before joining the theater staff. That critical perception, that flair for controversy, that love of volupte and the grand gesture familiar from his later work were already fully developed by the time he took over the Yearbook. It is not surprising that his only complete volume, the issue for 1899-1900, reflected these characteristics, and that the single most profound change was an improvement in the artwork. 31</page><page sequence="3">Diaghilev rejected outright the standard of repro- duction that had satisfied Molchanov, and insisted on high quality prints on heavy paper which compare favorably with the best available today. As regards subject matter his own predilections pre- vailed. He vented his passion for the history of art in an opening section, a luxuriously appointed "Jubilee of the Russian Theater." A portrait of Empress Elizaveta in masquerade costume was first in a series of magnificent plates, each protected by a sheet of tissue with its own decorative pattern. Interleaved with plates and commentary were facsimiles of pertinent documents in Russian theater history, including those of two eighteenth century programs-for Johann Adolph Hasse's opera La Clemenza di Tito and Franz Hilferding's ballet The Refuge of Virtue, works that had been produced respectively at the coronation festivities of Elizaveta and Catherine the Great.7 Elsewhere Diaghilev included the work of his own colleagues: color reproductions of Hermitage Theater programs by Konstantin Somov and Leon Bakst; drawings of Cesar Cui by llja Repin, not yet estranged from the Mir Iskusstva group, and of Vsevolozhsky by Valentine Serov; and a richly illustrated prose study by Alexander Benois of architectural ornamentation of the Alexandrinsky Theater. The new qualitative standard was all the more important because Diaghilev enlarged the Yearbook from octavo to quarto size, dimensions retained for the next ten years. Volkonsky later wrote that the Diaghilev issue created a new era in Russian book production, and that it "stupefied those who had expected a failure, and surpassed the expectations of those who had believed in its success."8 Diaghilev's radical shift in emphasis, while giving the Yearbook a sumptuous appearance, was a characteristically reckless act. It brought the publi- cation into the twentieth century technically as well as chronologically, but much was lost despite the gains. And the loss was concentrated in the area most valued by historians using the Yearbook as a reference-the amount of factual material. The review of season was much less informative than before. There was little or no background to new productions, no account of earlier productions of works revived, and no synopses. Even the magnifi- cent illustrations veiled a number of disadvantages. First, there were many fewer than Molchanov had seen fit to include. Second, the drawings and other original art, while enhancing the Yearbook's aes- thetic value, may not have conveyed accurately all the details of subjects represented. (Are Bakst's familiar drawings a faithful rendering of the dancers who brought them to life, or are they an artist's conception?) Third, Diaghilev instituted the questionable procedure of superimposing photo- graphs of characters in their roles against makeshift painted backdrops. It may not be assumed that these backdrops were part of the same production as the character. That they were optional becomes clear when the superimposition is technically faulty 4as it frequently was in later volumes), or when we encounter in other publications the same character in the same pose against a different background, or none. Fourth, no attempt was made to coordinate the placement of the plates with their corresponding text. The illustrations of a new production of Berlioz's Les Troyens, for example, are found in the review of spoken drama. Finally, this volume of the Yearbook must be assessed in the knowledge that its preparation had drastic effects on the issue for 1898-99. That volume, the first edited by Diaghilev, contained no commentary or illustrations of any kind-just statistical summaries. It was the only issue in the entire run thus curtailed, and one would almost prefer another of Molchanov's perfunctory but informative reviews to nothing at all. Volkonsky and Diaghilev imposed standards on their subordinates which in being met created hostilities that led in turn to their early departure from imperial service: neither lasted two years. Volkonsky, ironically, fired Diaghilev after a brief disagreement and then resigned himself after losing an argument to a ballerina influential with the tsar. Such actions seem much like excuse making, insufficient justifications, pretenses. Indeed, they appear to acknowledge that the theater staff had developed in its century of existence a mediocrity, a collective inertia that neither man had the patience or authority to change. The choice of their successors makes this hypothesis more credible. Vladimir Teljakovsky, the new Director, met all the traditional criteria-he was a career military officer not insensitive to art, and a seasoned civil servant adept at placating his seniors and keeping his subordinates in line.9 Ludwig Gelmersen, the new editor, was an expedient choice whose principal fame rested on his translations into Russian of French and German plays. Being Diaghilev's im- mediate successor threw his lackluster imagination into high relief. At first glance Gelmersen's issues look much like Diaghilev's-it is probable that he inherited materials that Diaghilev had already prepared for later use.1 He followed Diaghilev's example of introducing an issue with an illustrated historical study, and his review of season was more informative than the one Diaghilev had left. But the opulence Diaghilev had established, a few exceptions apart, was set aside. The color plates and the glossy paper fail to hide the new economies- the plates were fewer, there were no interleaved facsimiles or protective cover- ings. Too, Gelmersen introduced his own irksome practices, such as captioning photographs of indi- viduals with act and scene numbers instead of characters' or actors' names. Gelmersen's death in 1905 may be the reason for an otherwise unexplained three year delay in the Yearbook's publication. In a note submitted with the 1902-03 issue we learn from Peter Gnedich, one of the charter organizers to whom the editorship now passed, that four volumes of the Yearbook, 32</page><page sequence="4">covering the 1902-03 to the 1905-06 seasons, would be published in the eighteen months between summer 1905 and spring 1907. Gnedich brought out the overdue issues with great industry, and then his energies flagged. The volumes for 1906-07 and 1907-08 fell behind schedule, and were issued late without supplements. For some reason-possibly Gnedich's bias for drama, the press of other duties, or his dis- inclination to continue as editor-the treatment of ballet in the review of season in the 1904-08 volumes is the least satisfactory of any published up to that time. For three years the St. Petersburg ballet summary contained no illustrations whatever, an omission that coincided with a shift of editorial interest to Alexander Gorsky's works being pro- duced in Moscow. One can only speculate about the reasons for this: it is possible that the Yearbook reflected Teljakovsky's favor of the Moscow ballet- master.1 1 Between 1901 and 1908 the Yearbook suffered an understandable decline. Its editors tried to retain Diaghilev's flourishes but lacked his drive and adeptness. This had the unpleasant effect of lowering Diaghilev's standards to the level of the new administration. Other complications, including publishing delays and the general strike, led to a falling-off of subscriptions. At the end of 1908 there was talk of discontinuing the Yearbook, and it was saved, reputedly, only because the tsar himself found it 'useful and necessary.' The editorship changed hands a final time, and with Nicholas Drizen, as with Diaghilev, came important new initiatives. The format was reduced to dimensions smaller than those of the original issues some twenty years earlier. It now came out in a number of separate installments, usually seven or eight each year. The goals of the original editors were reconsidered. The review of season, which had been the point of the publication at the outset, was reduced from a series of lengthy articles to the barest of sketches. The special studies, which had been supplemental since 1894, now constituted the main substances of each installment. Included among these were criticism and reports on theaters outside Russia, two subjects excluded from con- sideration in the early years. While Drizen did not reinstate Diaghilev's standard of photographic duplication, he abandoned the technique of super- imposing photographs onto unrelated backgrounds and included in each volume more color plates than had been customary before. Many of Drizen's changes seem motivated by a desire to increase subscriptions, and this desire founded in turn on the premise that most readers still preferred spoken drama. Perhaps because of this, ballet as it had been under Gnedich, tends to be slighted in the late issues of the Yearbook. This is nowhere more evident than in the 1910 issue, which contains the notoriously brief report-nine lines-of Marius Petipa's death after more than 55 years of imperial service. II. Regular features of the Yearbook 2 In addition to the illustrations, those parts of the Yearbook most helpful to the ballet scholar may be arranged in two simple categories-prose articles and statistical summaries. The former include the yearly review of season, one each for St. Petersburg and Moscow, various shorter reports, and a number of special studies (see Appendix B). Over the years the review of season varied according to the editor in the amount of informa- tion and pictorial coverage it contained. As we have seen, the original editors declared it the centerpiece of the Yearbook, and their successors made it increasingly less important. Despite this, and the volume in which it did not appear at all (1898-99), and the years (1904-08) when there were no illustrations for one of the ballet companies, this feature supplies a wealth of information concerning dates and casts of performances. Of special value in the early seasons are detailed synopses of new ballets, which, in the cases I have been able to confirm, approximate very closely the wording of the librettos sold at performances, which today are bibliographic rarities. Next in importance among the prose articles are the notices of anniversary jubilees, and death notices. Apart from an exception like Petipa, these provide an extensive review of a major artist's career, and biographical data on lesser artists otherwise difficult to obtain. Third, and published only occasionally, are the miscellanies, short articles on a variety of specialized topics. From the beginning the Yearbook contained an imposing array of statistics, which served to illus- trate both the wealth of talent and the extensive bureaucracy of the imperial theaters. Like the review of season most of the statistics were organized by city (St. Petersburg first, then Mos- cow) and by company (drama, opera, ballet). For some categories, having only marginal interest for the ballet scholar, mention will suffice. These are the registers of support and administrative staffs, and the seating plans of the theaters. Important are the following: 1) The calendar of performances, which informs the reader of exactly what work was given in each of the six imperial theaters every day of the season, including benefit performances. From Volume II the total of performances by company is provided, from Volume III the box office receipts of each performance, and from Volume VI a total of receipts for each company. 33</page><page sequence="5">2) The register of works, which specifies the number of acts and scenes, the author(s) and composer(s), the dates of performances that season, and whether a work is being produced for the first time. We know, for example, that in St. Pertersburg during the 1902-03 season the ballet Corsair, in four acts, by St.-Georges and Mazilier, taken from the poem by Lord Byron, with music by Adam and Pugni, was performed three times: 9 and 23 October 1902, and on 12 January 1903. Refine- ments in these data, such as whether Petipa's interpolated scene "Le Jardin animr" to music of Delibes was included in these performances, we must learn from another source. 3) The register of artists, a complete roster of performers in the imperial theaters. In addition to giving the date of entry into service (not applicable to some touring foreign artists), this most valuable contribution lists for each member of the ballet companies the number of performances given that season in both opera and ballet, the named solo parts performed (i.e., those that would merit separate billing on a program), and the number of times such parts were performed. For example: in the 1902-03 season Anna Pavlova appeared in no operas and in 46 per- formances of 21 ballets. Of these 46, 29 were in named parts: 2 as Nikia in La Bayadbre, 1 as Juanita in Don Quixote, 1 each of Giselle and Myrtha in Giselle, 3 of Flora in Flora's Awakening, etc. 4) The register the ballet school, with photograph) of teaching staff and the report of the latter being a list (some years of the graduating class. Having provided all this, the Yearbook has more than justified the attention of modern scholars. It would be misleading to suppose, however, that it was free of defects. I have referred to some of these in the preceding section (the inquisitive will find a generous selection of critical viewpoints in the work of journalists who reviewed each volume as it appeared). There are others of which the reader should be aware. The outlook of Yearbook editors-even the most adventurous-was limited and protective. Apart from a few pages in the late issues, there is nothing in the Yearbook of the influential private theaters in Russia that flourished during its run, no hint of the polemics that informed ballet criticism in other journals, nothing about theater activities in Russian cities other than St. Petersburg and Moscow, nothing about works that failed. If the Yearbook were our only source, we would remain completely ignorant of circumstances surrounding the 1905 strike, the dismissal of Nijinsky, or the activity of a shadow figure like Nicholas Sergejev. The Yearbook was, furthermore, technically deficient in several respects. Dating becomes pre- carious after the second issue, for with Volume III the customary censor's approval, accompanied by a date, was replaced with the uninformative notice "Published by the order of the Ministry of the Imperial Court." The number of late issues compli- cates this problem, forcing the scholar to rely on other, approximate information, such as the dates of reviews. One's frustration increases with the remarkably careless editorial policy regarding indexes. A table of contents is provided with every issue, and lists of illustrations are standard. But there is in the entire run only one cumulative index, which covers Volumes I-XII, and which was added, with its own pagination, to the end of the 1903-04 supplement. Finally, lengthy scrutiny of the Year- book makes the reader ever more aware of minor errors, which are numerous. Misprints and incorrect attributions in captions are typical; occasionally there are conflicts between entries in different statistical summaries. One wonders whether the whole groundswell of interest in heritage, the urge to record the achieve- ments of past and present of which the Yearbook gives testimony, was not motivated by an un- conscious sense of cataclysm, a fin de si/cle pessimism that was confirmed by the first world war. The last years of the Yearbook are incomplete and full of final signs: an era-a world-was crumbling to its end. It is especially sad to read Peter Morozov's valedictory summary at the begin- ning of the 1915 issue, where he tells of what the Yearbook had achieved, the obstacles that it had faced and overcome. He closes with the optimistic thought that it "might be reconsidered soon," which beguiles us with its blend of artlessness and futility. But the glorious final days of the imperial theaters, out of which emerged Diaghilev and a host of world renowned artists and teachers, had ended. And so too had its chronicle. FOOTNOTES 1. Major libraries in this country that preserve the Yearbook include: The Library of Congress, The New York Public Library, and the Widener Library at Harvard University; the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor lacks issues for seasons 1906-07 and 1907-08; the University of Chicago (and possibly others) preserves the Yearbook on microfilm. 2. Bibliographies occasionally contain citations to three additional years, which would put the complete run of the Yearbook at 1890-1918. The four sets that I have consulted, all ostensibly complete, end with the 1915 issue. Theater activity in Russia was much curtailed by World War I and the revolution, and it is almost illogical to suppose that a publication with the Yearbook's tradition of expense and luxury would continue under wartime conditions. The first issue of the Yearbook of the State Academic Theaters, an obvious attempt by the new regime to maintain continuity with the old Yearbook, is dated 1918 and reflects in its austerity the difficulties of wartime theater. The similarity of titles and the date may have confused some bibliographers into believing the Yearbook continued without a break into the Soviet era, a belief which, in the absence of the missing issues, must be considered incorrect. 3. While each had its own clientele, the three companies were not completely independent of one another. Children in the theater school were trained in dance, music, languages and acting. Even after being selected to specialize in ballet a student would be expected to participate in an opera or play (usually as an extra) if this were dictated by the needs of the production. (The earlier the period of Russian history one 34</page><page sequence="6">considers, the more common this double duty would be.) At the professional level there was considerable interaction. Marius Petipa and Lev lvanov created ballets for operas as a normal part of their responsibilities, and both the drama and opera audiences had favorite dancers, often the ballet's leading character dancers. Their appearances wre a frequent adornment to non-alletic theater, and some dances-like Felix Kshessinsky's mazurka, which he performed for over a half centur-became legendary. 4. No doubt the complexity of this task, specially deciding what to publish from a vast accumulation of material, forced the editorship-which for the first issue appears to have been a group but whose names were not seified-into postponment, a fault of many later issues. It came out in February 1892, almost a year late. 5. Reference to illustrations calls to mind earlier Russian publications remarkable in this respect. Perhaps the most impressive of these, Daniel Rovinsky's Russian National Pictures (Russkija nerodnyja kartinkil, a study of folklore, was published at St. Petersburg in 1881. In addition to five volues of translations and commentary, Rovinsky published supplemental volumes of large format illustrations, some on subjects relating to music and dance. Many of these were in color and some were foldouts that practically cover e modern desktop. For its day Rovinsky's work was a technical tour de force and is still a basic reference. 6. Recurring features are described below, pp. 11-14, and are summarized on the chart in Appendix A. 7. Diaghilev also included a facsimile of music from a new opera production (Cui's Saracen), a fancy touch that he used again in the programs for Musorgky's Boris Godunov in Paris, 1908. 8.

It is only charitable to acknowledge that Teljakovsky, whose directorship was subject to continuous vicious criticism, showed great courage and persistence in the execution of his post. He acted as mediator between an aloof court and a host of demanding artists for the last sixteen years of tsardom's demise. He held the theaters together during the strike of 1905, and managed to retain at least the occasional services of great artists, such as Pavlova, Kshessinskaja and Shaljapin during a time of wholesale western migration. His decisions were not always defensible-what need had the imperial theaters of an extravagant new production of Bizet's Djamileh?-but occasionally they reflected a foresight uncharacteristic of many of his predecessors. For example, he negotiated with Diaghilev (albeit unsuccessfully) to have some of Stravinsky's works produced in the imperial theaters. 10. We find, for example, in the 1901-02 issue a special section devoted to the tsar's private theater, the Hermitage. It contains several programs and another reproduction of a decorative program title-page by Somov, i.e., of the kind that Diaghilev had included for the first time in his own issue. 11. One might be tempted to construe the omission as a reprisal against the members of the St. Petersburg ballet who honored the 1905 strike, But this would not explain why the Moscow ballet was similarly neglected in the 1907-08 issue. 12. Any attempt to list in prose all the exceptions to regular occurrences of these features would be tedious. The reader is invited to consult Appendix A, where this information is presented in a table.
