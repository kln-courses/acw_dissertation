<plain_text><page sequence="1">20 KEW BULLETIN VOL. 21 Ambrosia and Idols.*-Mycology has an undeserved reputation for being esoteric, and many mycologists are undoubted obscurantists. It is therefore most refreshing to encounter a mycological book which is popular, not only in intention but also in fact, at least so far as may be judged from the publisher's confidence in issuing a third edition. It is a pity that the author has expressly and implicitly to preach the simple faith that Science will build a Better World, leading us to the Good Life, even if he does not himself entirely believe. The layman cannot be expected to accept these anthropomorphic and argillopedic idols so that scientists who set them up are suspect, and so, by inference, is science in general. On the other hand, it is natural that the layman should want to know, if he wants to know anything about fungi, how they directly affect his life, and this is what, among other things, Professor Christensen sets out to teach, as the title of his book foretells. There are chapters on toxic fungi, industrial fungi, crop diseases, spoilage of stored products and of building materials. But this is no mere text on mycological engineering, so reproduction and dispersal, symbiosis in a wide sense, and other vital subjects are all covered in a narrative style which owes much to the contemporary American novel. The work concludes with a rather rambling chapter on experiments with fungi and a diatribe against taxonomists. The line-illustrations, fortunately few in number, do not match the prose style in palatability. A layman would be rightly sceptical, for example, of Pilobolus as depicted in fig. 5- D. M.
