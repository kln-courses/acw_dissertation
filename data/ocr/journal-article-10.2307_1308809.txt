Opinion Is it Really Rape or Forced Copulation? In the Introduction to their book (An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology. Sin- auer Associates, Sunderland, 1981), Krebs and Davies justify their use of "catchy descriptive labels for various behaviour patterns such as 'rape', 'manipulation', and 'sneaker'," as an attempt "to make our arguments clear" and to avoid "an obfuscating screen of scientific jargon." Although I agree with their intent, I be- lieve the present tendency by many behavioral ecologists to use "catchy descrip- tive labels" conveys too strong an impression of anthropomorphism. This is espe- cially true for rape, a word that engenders very strong emotions and has connotations far beyond its dictionary definition. Although it is technically correct to refer to copulation under force as rape by (for instance) male acanthocephalan worms (Abele, L. G. and S. Gilchrist. 1977. Homosexual rape and sexual selection in acanthocephalan worms. Science 197: 81-83), scorpionflies (Thornhill, R. 1980. Rape in Panorpa scorpionflies and a gen- eral rape hypothesis. Anim. Behav. 28: 52-59) or mallard ducks (Barash, D. P. 1977. Sociobiology of rape in mallards [Anas platyrhynchos]: responses of the mated male. Science 197: 788-789), the situation in these animals bears very little similarity to the manner in which rape is used and understood in today's society (e.g., accounts in newspapers, magazines, radio and television, Rape Crisis Center communications, statutes, criminal codes, etc.). Consequently, I believe behavior- al ecologists weaken their credibility in the eyes of the general public, who are likely to think (albeit incorrectly) that human qualities are being attributed to non- human animals. Replacing "rape" with "forced copulation" may not result in as catchy a title, but it does correctly describe the behavior and yet is not "an obfus- cating screen of scientific jargon." With the vast amount of literature appearing each year, it is obvious that indi- vidual publications will only be read by a few specialists. It is equally obvious that authors increase their book's or paper's chances of reaching a wider audience if the titles are catchy and unusual (e.g., Riechert, S. E. 1978. Games spiders play: behavioural variability in territorial disputes. Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. 3: 135-162; Rutowski, R. L. 1979. The butterfly as an honest salesman. Anim. Behav. 27: 1269-1270). However, it is important that such titles fairly reflect the behaviors in- volved with no hint of anthropomorphism. This is especially true for high-interest fields such as behavioral ecology and sociobiology, which are currently attracting the attention of workers from other fields (e.g., Hull, D. L. 1978. Sociobiology: Scientific bandwagon or traveling medicine show? Society 15(6): 50-59). DONALD F. J.
