<plain_text><page sequence="1">^ Georges Montforez. La glaisiere. Paris. Gallimard. 1963. 213 pages. 9.50 F. For those who are weary of both the literature of commitment of the Thirties, Forties, and Fifties and of the more recent new novel with its antiseptic touch, its realism, and its refusal of the anthropomorphic view, Montforez's novel, which follows four other books of his published by Gallimard, is a windfall. Vindi- cating the human attempt to color and trans- form the world, the characters turn a former clay-pit at Montreuil, now a municipal dump surrounded by gardens and little houses, into a wonderland - where all is not for the best, as Pangloss would have had it, but where at least good faith is possible, patience leads to fulfill- ment, creativity predominates over destruction, and human experience brings more smiles than grimaces. In a careful but easily approach- able style, this novel provides, without senti- mentality, a pleasurable excursion into a world of human meaning. Catharine H.
