<plain_text><page sequence="1">Julia Ustinova THE Thiasoi OF THEOS HYPSISTOS IN TANAIS In 1918 M. I. Rostovtzeff wrote that the main feature which character- ized the style of life of Panticapaeum and other Greek cities of the northern Black Sea littoral in the Imperial period was the most potent, hitherto unseen, iranization of political, religious, and cultural life.1 This idea is unanimously shared by the modern scholars, who prefer however to employ the term "sarmatization" of Bosporus. Indeed, the religious situation in the Bosporan kingdom may be con- sidered relatively stable up to the beginning of the first century, when it changed radically.2 This change was due to important ethnic and po- litical movements, which resulted in the Bosporus's dependence on Rome and the growing flow of Sarmatians, along with the natives of neighboring Black Sea regions, to the Bosporan cities. Sarmatian migration is reflected in the archaeological record.3 New ethnic elements appeared in the population of Korokondama, Hermo- nassa, Phanagoria, Kepoi, and other Bosporan cities. But the greatest influx of Sarmatians is obvious in Tanais, evidence being not only ar- chaeological but also onomastic.4 According to D. B. Shelov, among the names known in Tanais, 55.3 percent are the Greek ones, 4 percent the Roman, and 40.8 percent the barbarian, while among the latter, 80 percent are of Iranian origin.5 M. I.

Materials of the Tanais's city site and necropolis show the permanently growing importance of the Sarmatian part of the population, and a number of pe- culiarities proper only to Tanais and never occurring elsewhere.7 As to the religious concepts of the inhabitants of Tanais, evidence of the steadiness of Sarmatian beliefs and traditions is rather rich: weap- ons stuck into the graves of the necropolis,8 burial constructions in the shape of circular stone fences,9 horse harnesses in ground graves and horse burials in barrows,l? pieces of chalk and paint in graves-the two latter features generally related to solar and fire cults of the Iranians.11 Fire was the sacred element of the ancient Iranians, abundant finds of portable incense-burners being indicative of the existence of the fire cult. 12 Not a single temple or shrine of a Greek god or hero has yet been found on a comparatively well-investigated city site. Terracottas are extremely rare;l of all the preserved inscriptions only three mention names of Greek gods.14 There is also no data on penetration of Oriental cults in Tanais from its founding to the beginning of the common era. Thus, hellenization of Tanais was highly superficial. Besides, its de- gree diminished with the transition from the first to the second and third centuries. It is only together with the named ethnocultural pro- cess in Tanais and in the Bosporan kingdom as a whole that one is to consider the cult of Theos Hypsistos. 6 Ibid., pp. 247-48. 7 For example, ibid., p. 249. 8 T.

Knipovitsh (p. 114) noted that two of these dedications are by royal legates, i.e., non-Tanaits. M. I.

All of them are dated, begin with the invocation Agathe tyche, and many are decorated with the images of eagles. The majority of documents have panotXlovTzo paotiEoq TOz 61ivoq TOV 65?ivoq (pitkKaioapo} Kai (ptXopcotaiou as a preamble. Rostovtzeff noted that "the tenor of all the inscriptions allows one to suppose that the thiasoi were official reli- gious associations, or in any case were recognized by the state." 15 Four forms of designation of the associations may be found in the preserved inscriptions: 1. I o6cvo6oS Ti icpi 9 eO6v DVIttOV Ki ispCa ... Kcai ...; 2. i Glvo6OqS l T[pit ipa ... Ka . ...; 3. EioT7ouT:TOti a6Ei?poi oGspOe3 vot 0e6v VIwtozTOV rpi irpop3i'TEpov; and 4. Oirq[Joo] d6k(Lp[kOv TCOV TCp.i iEcpat] (CIRB, no. 1284; Oirqoos is re- constructed, but the list of officials characteristic of the thiasoi of Theos Hypsistos is preserved). An idea has been put forward that synodoi named in the first and the second ways and the ones named in the third way represent different types of associations because they were called differently and had different magistrates.16 But in CIRB, no. 1284 (form 4), the word d6Ek- (poi is combined with the features, which are proper to the inscriptions of the first two groups, and the "brothers" are named [ouv]o6eiTat in lines 13-14. The worshiped deity being one and the same in all the as- sociations, it seems reasonable to consider all the corporations belong- ing to the same institution. S. A. Zhebelev compared the Tanais inscriptions with the Athenian sacred law of Iobachoi.17 In the associa- tion of Iobachoi members dai6 nazpo6S and tlh ato6 nazTpo6 did not enjoy equal rights. Since the word EiornotqoC6 has the meaning "foster" (e.g., Is 3:46, 3:50, 6:36, 9:9), Zhebelev suggested considering the eioY7otrlToi ad6E&amp; poi members 1I dairo inap6o; and not the members recently admit- ted to the association, as a number of scholars supposed.18 15 M.

EiokotrolToi da6EXpoi were headed by one or several (CIRB, nos. 1286, 1283) presbeutai, whose functions are unclear. The hierarchy of magistrates in these collegia was rather complex. Hiereus is always mentioned first; in some inscriptions next goes pater (CIRB, nos. 1263, 1277, 1282, 1283).20 What pater synodou was busy with, is not clear. There was synagogos in every association. Hesychios defined syna- gogos as ouvF,oTtoq, 6ooTpda7ni o (s.v. "ouvCayryoS6"), so one may sup- pose that he organized common meals. Synagogos could also have been the manager of finances and property of a thiasos. Posts of philagathos and paraphilagathos aroused a lot of contradic- tory conjectures. I. V. Pomjalovski thought them to deal with common feasts, but his examples from Asia Minor are hardly convincing.21 Ac- cording to N. I. Novosadski, philagathos supervised the thiasitai's morals and exercised control over admission of new members. The im- portance of these functions explains the existence of philagathos's assistant.22 A. Salac suggested that conduct of thiasitai was under surveillance of synagogos. Pointing out the Jewish influence upon the cult of Theos Hypsistos and claiming a noncollective nature of the magistratures of philagathos and paraphilagathos in the Hellenic world, he wrote: "In the Jewish communities of Palestine and diaspora there were ... offi- cials called gabba'e sedaka. The word sedaka means justice and charity dues. It was established that these dues were to be raised only by two officials. The nature of this post is distinctively collective, as in the 19 Compare the Panticapaeum tombstone, erected by ouvo6Eciat in honor of TOv i6tov d&amp;?X(p6v (CIRB, no. 104). The custom of calling members of collegia "brothers" was widely spread in the Imperial period (cf. A. D. Nock, "The Historical Importance of Cult Associations," Classical Review 38 [1924]: 105-6). 20 Examples of the presence of pater in cult associations are listed in Nock's article (p. 105). A comparison with pater of the Mithraic mysteries inevitably comes to mind, but in this case extreme caution is necessary, for pater of the Mithraists held the first and not the second place in the hierarchy. The Tanais associations seem to be related to the Mith- raic ones only through their common Iranian precursors. N. I. Novosadski, in terms of his conception, compared pateres in Tanais with pater of the Christian community ("Bospor- skije fiasy," Trudy Sektzii Arkheologii Rossijskoj Assotziatzii Nauchno-issledovatel'skikh Institutov Obshchestvennykh Nauk 3 [1928]: 64). 21 I.

But philagathos appears in a dedication to Zeus and Hera Soteres as well (CIRB, no. 76); this post can be found in gentile associations of Asia Minor.24 Be it not very often, one may encounter both charity25 and supervision over the morals of the mem- bers26 in the private cult associations on the eve of the common era. Posts of gymnasiarchos and neaniskarchos are unanimously related to the ephebic activities. But both Greek palestra and gymnasium dis- appear from the life of the Bosporan kingdom just by the beginning of the common era. In graves, palestrites' ware is replaced with weap- ons.27 No traces of gymnasium have been found in semi-Sarmatic Tanais. Besides, gymnasiarchoi are rarely listed among the members of private cult associations. J. Oehler cites only six examples, all but Tanais, and they always belong to associations of noncitizens, who were not admitted to the city gymnasia.28 Arising contradiction may be obviated if one supposes that the terms gymnasiarchos and neaniskar- chos were used to designate some other functions. Below we return to the structure of the associations. For the present, two features of the Tanais thiasoi are to be stressed: first, not a single inscription mentions a female name; second, all or nearly all the free males of Tanais seem to have belonged to the thiasoi. Three hundred thiasitai who lived between A.D. 225 and 300, that is, in the most com- pletely documented five years, are known by name. The total number of inhabitants of Tanais being then 1,500-2,000 (to judge by the size of the city site), the number of adult males could not exceed 250-300.29 There is no ground to doubt that the situation was the same before or later. 23 A.

The synodoi of Panticapaeum, which had the same officials as the thiasoi of Tanais, used to erect stelae commemorating their deceased members. A lot of stelae are decorated with the images of warriors, be they mounted or not.30 The composition of synodoi is exclusively male. V. V. Shkorpil and Rostovtzeff considered them connected with the military organization of citizens.31 One inscription of Tanais thiasoi (CIRB, no. 1259) differs substan- tially from all the rest.32 It is dated 11 Apelaeus 401 (Bosporan era; A.D. 104) and is dedicated to the celebration of the "Day of Tanais" by a group of iEpcEg, ouvayOyo6, q(pXayao6, napa(piXaya06q Kati TCV kotIr)v 0tacst&amp;iUv. The deity is not named. The slab (fig. 1) is deco- rated with a relief representing a horseman mounted on a standing horse, which is turned to the right. An altar is blazing before the cava- lier, and behind the altar one can see a tree. The cavalier has long hair and a beard; he is dressed in trousers, a coat, and a cloak and holds a rhyton with his right hand. As the god is not named, T. N. Knipovitch was inclined to consider him the river god Tanais and the association Festverein, organized for the celebration of one festival.33 Shelov, following A. I. Boltunova, points out, that in this inscription the list of officials is followed with the words Kait TCOv kOItnOv Otaotzcov, while normally the formula Kai oi kotIoi OtaoeiTat is used.34 It may mean that the Day of Tanais was celebrated not by all the members of thiasoi but by some part of them and that the thiasos was founded not 30 The outstanding thiasitai could be decorated with a gold crown.

Salac also noted that river deities were never depicted as horsemen, and since the list of officials corresponds to that of the thiasoi of Theos Hypsistos, the relief is to be considered the image of this very god.35 Indeed, it is inconceivable that in Tanais-where all the numerous inscriptions of private cult associations belonged to the thiasoi of wor- shipers of Theos Hypsistos-an official document commemorating the Day of the city could have been issued without an emphatic calling of the god by his proper name. The absence of the god's name or epiclesis indicates that everybody knew him. Besides, his image was also present on the slab. A diadem from a third century royal burial may serve as indirect evidence that Theos Hypsistos was represented as a cavalier. On the plate of this diadem the same scene as on the Tanais stela is depicted: a horseman holding a rhyton before a blazing altar, a tree behind it (fig. 2). The thiasoi of Theos Hypsistos were apparently patronized by the royal family, so it is quite natural to find an image of this god on a royal diadem.36 Finally, I. A. Levinskaja argues that there were no anthropomorphic images of Theos Hypsistos in the Greco-Roman world.37 But the dedi- cation to Theos Hypsistos from Lydia is carved on a stela with a relief of a sitting figure.38 In Thracia, in a shrine of the local Theos Hypsis- tos, a number of dedications to that god were found together with a re- lief representing a bust of the god carried by an eagle.39 The anonymous deity was designated in the Bosporan kingdom in seven ways: (1) 06b c DvIjito0o; TavToKpdTop T ?6Xoyi0lTo, CIRB, nos. 1123, 1125, 1126 (in the Jewish manumissions from Gorgippia).

(7) 0OcE, CIRB, no. 71 (manumission from Panticapaeum, the former slave is liberated under the guardianship of a synagogue). Who was this anonymous deity, worshiped under similar epicleseis? Modern scholars give different answers to that question. The first and the last cases are apparent,40 but the rest have been discussed for more than a hundred years. Pomjalovski considered the god Zeus (cOTorTp, oTpdaoto, kal3a6?ug), since the stelae are decorated with the images of eagles.41 V. V. Latyshev supposed it was Sabazios,42 basing his opin- ion on the so-called Pirotos inscription.43 Later he accepted the opinion of E. Schiirer.44 Rostovtzeff suggested that Theos Hypsistos Sabazios was influenced by the Iranian conception of the solar deity.45 In 1897 Schiirer tried to ground a hypothesis, according to which the associations of worshipers of Theos Hypsistos in Tanais emerged un- der the Jewish influence.46 His arguments may be summed up as fol- lows: the expression cEpOpcEvot 06ev iUIJtoOV is nearly terminus technicus in the literature of the Imperial period and was used to des- ignate non-Jews who performed some Jewish rites and professed monotheistic religion; there have been Jews in the Bosporan kingdom; and among the names of thiasitai the Jewish ones are mentioned seven times: one name two times and another five times. He also compiled a list of applications of the epiclesis and demonstrated that, although it was the Judaic god who was named Theos Hypsistos most often, Zeus, Attis, Sabazios, Mithra, and other gods could be called so as well. According to Schiirer, the trend toward monotheism, which was characteristic of the Imperial period, when joined to the Judaic propa- ganda, led to the emergence of the syncretic cult of Theos Hypsistos. "This cult was neither Judaism nor paganism, but a neutralization of both."47 This opinion is generally shared.48 40 C. Roberts, T. C. Skeat, and A. D.

I. Novosadski thought Theos Hypsistos to be Greek Zeus approx- imating the universal omnipotent deity and stressed the common fea- tures in the organization of the Bosporan thiasoi and the early Christian communities.49 Knipovitch refused to advance any opinion on this problem, only supposing a possibility of relation between Theos Hyp- sistos and the local tradition. Her publication of the stela with relief in 1949 had an important impact on the solution of the problem. Salac connected the relief with the image of the Thracian horseman, his rep- resentations widely spread in the beginning of the common era, and claimed some traces of influence of the Dionysus-Sabazios cult.50 A similar point of view was expressed by M. Tacheva-Hitova.51 Recently it has been proposed that the roots of the Theos Hypsistos cult be sought in the religious concepts of the Iranians, but the authors of this suggestion did not support it with detailed arguments.52 At present the idea that Theos Hypsistos was Zeus has already been rejected. Thus, there are three rival tendencies in the modern literature. The adherents of the most widely spread trend consider Theos Hypsis- tos of the Bosporan inscriptions to be the Judaic god. The second group of scholars recognize the Thracian influence as decisive. Finally, the third direction is to search for the Iranian background in the wor- ship of Theos Hypsistos. After Schiirer, the advocates of his conception have not supported it with new arguments of substantial importance. This conception is based upon the thesis that opf360Evot TOv 096v is terminus technicus meaning Judaic semi-proselytoi (B. Lifchitz and J. Juster) or quasi- proselytoi (I. A. Levinskaja). It has already been noted that, from the point of view of the law, the word semi-proselytos is senseless, so L. H. Feldman preferred the term "sympathizer."53 This word may be a conventional nomination-but nomination of what? The studies of Feldman and A. T. Kraabel demonstrated that in this case we deal with a steady scientific prejudice, wandering over handbooks, monographs, and articles as a reference to something proved long ago.54 For decades semi-proselytoi were considered to be "Epigraficheskije pamjatnik; kul'ta Theos Hypsistos kak istochnik po etnokul'turnoi istorii Bospora," and "Kul't Oa6S iVlorTog na Bospore," p. 67 49 Novosadski (n. 20 above), p. 63. 50 Salac (n. 23 above). 51 Tacheva-Hitova, "O kul'te 0Ec6S iU'trogq na Bospore" (n. 40 above). 52 Shelov (n. 3 above), p. 280; Kochelenko and Blawatsky (n. 36 above), pp. 12-13. 53 G.

They attended synagogue, professed monotheism in the biblical sense, observed some requirements of the law, and formed a considerable social group. Hellenistic Judaism could well have succeeded in becoming a world religion if it were not for its national- istic roots, which were, however, rejected by the Jews of diaspora with- out pain. A long list of scholars, whose point of view may be summed up as above, is cited in the article by Kraabel.55 Feldman and Kraabel doubted the firmness of this theory, verified its basis-and found out that it has been built on sand. The entire con- struction rests upon ten passages from Acts: 10:2, 10:22, 10:35, 13:16, 13:26, 13:43, 13:50, 16:14, 17:4, and 18:7. 0Eoosypiq is mentioned only once: Jn 9:31. Other rare occurrences of these expressions in literature and epigraphy are interpreted, proceeding from Acts. But the careful examination of the text by K. Lake revealed that in all the cases (except two) the question is only of "pious" and "revering," without indication whether they are Jews or sympathizers.56 An important expression, which presents an almost insuperable obstacle for the advocates of the strictly technical sense of the word, is cspopevcov ntporclXTkuv (Acts 13:43), which certainly cannot mean semi-proselytoi. Metuentes, the supposed equivalent of CoE36p0 vot in Latin, is men- tioned only once: metuentes sabbata (Juvenal, Satirae 14:96-99). But this case alone was sufficient for J. Bernays to claim that Greek opc36- p.tvot, (popoupeva, and Latin metuentes find corresponding expressions in Hebrew, in the Old Testament, and especially in Psalms.57 Feldman demonstrated that in Psalms this word is applied to all the worshipers of the God, and apparently to Jews in Ps 135:19-20.58 Indeed, as Feld- man puts it, "fear of God" is sine qua non for either Jews or newcom- ers, according to the Bible. As to the epigraphical data, it is evident that both in Latin and Greek inscriptions these expressions were used to designate Jews (a well- known inscription from the Miletus theater)59 as well as pagans (CIL 55 To cite only the recent works: M. Avi-Yonah, The Jews of Palestine (Oxford, 1976), p. 37; M. Hangel, Judaism and Hellenism (Philadelphia, 1975), 1:313; K. G. Kuhn and H. Stegemann, "Proselyten," in P.-W. R.E.

One more reason may be added to these arguments. In the preserved works of Philo and Josephus, persons inclined to Judaism are never called Eocl36svot or (pop3ouj?vot. Philo calls them proselytoi or 6oiov dvOp6ccov (De Specialibus Legibus 2.12.42), while for Josephus it was oi Ta&amp; il[Terpa TItPCVTEcg -Ori (Antiquitates Judaicae 3.8.9.217). It means that neither of them knew the term ?ep36LE?voq. The same applies to the Romans. Tacitus says: "transgressi in morum eorum" (Historiae 5.5). To Roman lawyers the term was also unfamiliar: it is absent in the Roman law.60 Feldman concludes that "Bernay's attempt to equate metuentes, sebomenoi, phoboumenoi and Yire'e Adonai with the sympathizers and thus bring order out of chaos ... must be therefore abandoned.... The resulting chaos would seem to be preferable to an order that is not in accordance with the facts."61 But was the Judaic proselytism really as widespread as it is usually considered to be? Recent archaeological investigations have supplied abundant information on the life of the Jewish diaspora, which de- manded a reconsideration of many long-standing conceptions based on the Greco-Roman or Christian written sources. Kraabel surveyed mate- rials of excavations of a number of synagogues with the purpose of es- tablishing whether sebomenoi constituted a considerable social group and if they were connected with synagogues. He points out that neither o(p36jEvot nor (popotjcEvot are mentioned in synagogue inscriptions, about a hundred of them having been studied, and that in ten of them 0EoEcfp3ci appear, but they are indisputable Jews; in these inscriptions there is nothing to suggest a Gentile "penumbria" around the diaspora synagogue communities; and symbolism used in the buildings is di- rected toward the Jewish community, with no apparent attempt to com- municate with persons from outside.62 Thus, nothing reveals the presence of Gentiles having joined the Jewish diaspora communities, and there is no hint that these Jews tried to reach their Gentile neighbors with any sort of religious message. It Jesu Christi, 4th ed. [Leipzig, 1909], 3:174, n. 9), but, as Feldman noted (p. 204, n. 20), this conjecture stays ungrounded.

The historicity of some large group of semi-proselytoi, which has not been even mentioned in Paul's letters and which is absent from the archaeological data, is questionable in the extreme.63 The aim of Kraabel was not to prove that Gentiles inclining to Judaism have never existed. He only demonstrated that neither written sources nor the ar- chaeological record support the existing notion of sebomenoi as a con- siderable social group. Two principal theses are thus of particular importance for the pur- poses of the present paper: oEpo3pEvot OEsv DWt(IJTOV is not a strict term and may describe both pagans and Jews, as well as proselytoi; and the missionary activity of Jews has been overestimated. The Jews of di- aspora lived in the pagan environment for generations, with no at- tempts being undertaken to find a religious compromise with Gentiles. We have come to the second link in the chain of arguments of Schtirer: Jews lived in the Bosporan kingdom, and there were syna- gogues in Panticapaeum and Gorgippia.64 The fact of the Jewish pres- ence by itself does not mean that a lot of inhabitants of Panticapaeum itself and of Tanais were even interested in the new religion, to say nothing of proselytism.65 But Panticapaeum and Gorgippia were large ports, centers of cul- tural interaction. And it is from there that Jewish manumissions come (only Jews had to set their coreligionists free once every seven years). Then why are these manumissions absent from Tanais, where numer- ous inscriptions of thiasoi come from, if these thiasoi were virtually formed by Jewish proselytoi, as Schtirer and the adherents of his the- ory claim? Why does not even a single hint point to the existence of a synagogue in Tanais? Why has the Jewish community left absolutely no traces? Among the Jewish proselytoi in the Roman Empire there were many women; women set their slaves free in Gorgippia (CIRB 1125) and Panticapaeum (CIRB 70), but why is not a single female 63 Ibid., p. 120. 64 In the manumission CIRB, no. 1123 the slave is set free 66o Aia, FT, "Hktov, but it does not mean that the religion of these Jews was not orthodox (Juster [n. 48 above], p. 288; Cumont " "YMITorog" [n. 48 above], col. 448). A number of scholars (Lifchitz [n. 40 above], p. 159; J. B. Frey, Corpus Inscriptionum Judaicarum, 1:690) are con- vinced that the use of such clauses was a necessary formality that was not considered important by the Jews themselves. Thus, the opinion of Blavatskaja ([n. 40 above], pp. 91-96), who believed the named reason sufficient to claim e0sq ijtotog TaVtOKcpdTlop e6UoyjrToS a pagan deity, is absolutely unacceptable. 65 Inscription CIRB, no. 64 about the construction of tpooeuXi 0eCp UWioaTo) ErnqK6 by Aurelius Valerius Sogos, the governor of Theodosia, is not typical, for in this very in- scription it is indicated that the dedicant "has long been absent, has stayed in foreign countries for 16 years and suffered a lot of disasters." The mere originality of this fate may serve as an argument against the idea of mass enthusiasm for Judaism among rank- and-file Bosporans. 163</page><page sequence="15">The Thiasoi of Theos Hypsistos in Tanais name mentioned among the Tanais thiasitai? Scyto-Sarmatic or Greco- Roman traditions do not explain this phenomenon: women played an important role in Sarmatian and Scythian society,66 and a lot of women belonged to Greco-Roman private cult associations. Schiirer noted that two names of Jewish origin are mentioned in the thiasoi-inscriptions: ESappaTiov (CIRB, nos. 1250, 1278, 1279, 1282, 1179) and AQapiov (CIRB, nos. 11278, 1287). He believed that they belonged to Jews living in Tanais.67 As to Azarion, experts in Iranian languages trace its Iranian roots.68 The name Sambation, according to L. Zgusta, penetrated the northern Black Sea littoral from the common Greco-barbarian onomasticon, which had been formed by that time.69 It is significant that in all the cases fathers of thiasitai with Jewish names bear Greek and Roman names. The last argument of Schtirer and those who follow him is that the anonymous god was called Theos Hypsistos. But the list of Schiirer himself, as well as the catalogs of F. Cumont, A. B. Cook, and C. Rob- erts, T. C. Skeat, and A. D. Nock show that many pagan gods could be named in this way.70 The point is that the epiclesis UitvoToC was widespread in the Impe- rial period and is not evidence of direct Jewish influence.71 It could only reflect some refined religious conception and a general tendency toward the anonymous character of the deity. It must be emphasized that in one and the same region different dei- ties could have been called Theos Hypsistos. For example, in Asia Mi- nor, where the Judaic god was called thus, a dedication 08Ec VIjiTozT Kai dyaia KaTa(pluyi was found (Pisidia).72 Ayaia Kaacpuyri, mentioned next to OE6; "YItGTOo , is surely the Roman Sancta Tutela.

The same situation is characteristic of Phrygia. Examples may be multiplied. So, in the countries where under the name Theos Hypsistos the Jewish god was worshiped and where a consider- able Jewish influence is doubtless, a number of other gods were also called "the most high." One essential inference follows: in the emergence of the Hypsistos cult the decisive role was played in different regions by different gods. It is utterly impossible to accept the opinion of Levinskaja that "the cult of Theos Hypsistos, spread in Egypt, Greece, Asia Minor, Thracia, Northern Black Sea Littoral, is to be considered a single cult, having however local peculiarities. The cult of Theos Hypsistos was generally linked with Judaism."76 As the examples above demonstrate, a single cult has never existed. Given the general tendency of the epoch toward monotheism and the anonymous character of the deity,77 in every particular case the image of Theos Hypsistos emerged on a definite, usually local basis, with or with- out Jewish influence or participation of some other gods. Consequently, extreme caution is necessary when one studies the religion of Theos Hyp- sistos in a given country, drawing on data from the other regions.78 Some scholars draw Theos Hypsistos close to Sabazios. Their argu- mentation is based on the so-called Pirotos inscription.79 It is a dedica- tion of a koinon OcEC TKrlKoC 6UvNiroTCp. The end of the inscription is not 75 L.

But for the Khazars, first, adoption of Judaism as state religion was a political demonstration of independence and equality with the Arab caliphate and the Byzantine empire and served as a response to the attempts of both Arabian and Byzantine rulers to bend the Khazars to their will (M. I. Artamonov, Istorija Khazar [Moscow, 1962], p. 264), while apparently there were no reasons for the adoption of Judaism in the Bosporan kingdom. Second, the new reli- gion was adopted only by the Khazar nobility, the majority of the population remaining Gentiles, Muslims, or Christians (D. M. Dunlop, The History of the Jewish Khazars [Princeton, N.J., 1954], pp. 92-115). In the Bosporan kingdom, and particularly in Tanais, the majority of the male population, if not all the male citizens, belonged to the thiasoi of Theos Hypsistos. And, third, the Judaism of the Khazars is reported in a great number of written sources-and the entire ancient tradition does not contain a hint to such an important event as adoption of Judaism by the Bosporan kingdom. (Phanagoria was called "a Jewish town" only in the ninth century by Ibn-Khordadbeg [see Nadel (n. 32 above), p. 24], and this epitheton is apparently connected with the Khazar presence. 79 First published by A. von Domaszewski, "Griechische Inschriften aus Moesien und Thrakien," Archaologisch-epigraphische Mitteilungen aus Osterreich-Ungarn 10 (1886): 238.

The list of the members of the koinon ends with Ota[. .] lcpa(tavos, which A. von Domaszew- ski reads as Oia[ooS] sc8a(tav6k. This reading is accepted by a number of scholars.80 Yet D. Decev supposed that Sebazianos is a proper name. His opin- ion is accepted by B. Gerov, Tacheva-Hitova, and Levinskaja.81 The association is then considered a group of worshipers of Theos Hypsis- tos and not a thiasos of Sabazios. But even if the Pirotos inscription has nothing to do with Sabazios, numerous monuments of the Theos Hypsistos cult found on the west- ern Black Sea littoral in recent decades show the important influence of the Sabazios cult.82 However, Dionysus-Sabazios was the most pop- ular local deity,83 and so his dominant role in the emergence of the Theos Hypsistos cult in the Roman epoch is quite natural. The Thracian royal family, related to the Bosporan Dynasty, was ob- viously devoted to the Theos Hypsistos cult. One may cite dedications of Pythodoris and Rhoimetalkos to Theos Hypsistos84 and a dedication U6Ip paoitXko0 'PotIeTadXKa KoTuog.85 This devotion could have influ- enced the emergence of the Hypsistos religion in the Bosporan king- dom, but the evidence of the possible Thracian impact is limited to only one piece, namely, a third-century inscription on a cult table from Cytaeum (CIRB, no. 942) about the erection of a temple OEC ppovzT6vt ?irnK6Op by the community of Cytaeum with the sponsorship of a former royal official.

In Thracia, Sabazios played an important role in the emergence of the cult of Theos Hypsistos. 2. The Bosporan royal family was related to the Thracian dynasty, which was devoted to the cult of Theos Hypsistos; Thracians lived in the Bosporan kingdom. 3. The Cytaeum community, headed by a former courtier, dedicated an inscription to some deity having common features with Sabazios. This inscription contains neither the expression "Theos Hypsistos" nor a list of magistrates characteristic of the thiasoi of this god.90 These reasons seem sufficient to assume the possibility of some influence of the Thracian Theos Hypsistos upon the appearance of the most high god in the Bosporan kingdom, but they are inadequate to recognize this influence as decisive. Meanwhile, the roots of the cult of Theos Hypsistos are to be searched for not in some distant land but in the Bosporan kingdom it- self, in the religious concepts of the Sarmatians, or broader, of the Ira- nians. This approach became more promising after the publication of the stela with relief by Knipovitch. As a parallel to the image of a horseman before a blazing altar with a tree behind it the third-century royal diadem may be cited (see fig. 2 above). A similar scene decorates a silver rhyton from the Karago- deuashkh tumulus (fourth century B.C. [fig. 3]), and Rostovtzeff proved it to be an image of the supreme god of the Iranian pantheon, a warrior and a power-giver, who had been worshiped by the Scythians and Sarmatians of old.91 V. D. Blavatski was also inclined to draw together the Karagodeuashkh god and the image on the Tanais relief.92 For deeper insight into the semantics of this scene one may remember that in the Indo-European religions the tree was a symbol of the uni- verse and an attribute of the fertility goddess, who often merged with it and whose image was sometimes substituted for the image of a tree.93 90 A. Salac ([n. 23 above], p. 222) supposed that the Thracian cavalier participated in the emergence of Theos Hypsistos in the Bosporan kingdom. He considered the rhyton in the hand of the horseman on the Tanais stela to point to the links with Sabazios. But, as Rostovtzeff has convincingly demonstrated ("Predstavlenija o monharkhicheskoj vlasti v Skifii i na Bospore" [n. 14 above], p. 6), the rhyton was a sacred object of the Iranians. It appeared on the Scytho-Sarmatian monuments as well. 91 Rostovtzeff, "Predstavlenija o monarkhicheskoj vlasti v Skifii i na Bospore." 92 V. D.

J. Shaub.94 Two ex- amples, which are simultaneous with the Tanais stela, are to be cited. On a stamp from the Roman fortress of Iluraton a goddess in a bell- shaped dress with griffins by her sides is represented with her head as a top of a tree and her hands as branches.95 A female torso is depicted on a second-century marmoreal fronton from Panticapaeum; the hands of the goddess are interpreted as branches.96 Thus, the picture of a horseman with rhyton before the tree, which is equivalent to the great fertility goddess, may be ranged together with such a monument as, for example, the plate of a rhyton from Merdjany (fig. 4). It represents a horseman with a rhyton before a goddess who is sitting in an armchair and holding a round vessel. On her sides there are a tree and a pole with a horsehead on it. This scene must be a rep- resentation of the sacred marriage, a stable Iranian cult image,97 which is depicted on a carpet from the V Pazyryk tumulus,98 on a relief from the Trekhbratni tumulus (fig. 5).99 The relief from a late Scythian site of Chajka100 (fig. 6) may be cited as a later example. A bearded horse- man with a rhyton10l is depicted before an altar, and near the altar stands a woman in a bell-shaped dress with some round object. D. S. Rajevski noted that the incised geometric figures-a circle above the man and a rectangle above the woman-are, respectively, symbols of the heaven and the earth fire,102 used still by the ancient Iranians,103 a fact that reveals once again the link between the cult of the supreme Iranian deities and the fire cult in south Russia.

The advanced suggestion on the semantics of the Tanais stela may find indirect confirmation in a slab with the image of a goddess in the fronton, used for the second time for a building inscription.105 Shelov brings this relief together with the representation of a branch-handed goddess in the fronton of the Panticapaeum stela.106 Terra-cottas are extremely rare in Tanais, but among them is a figurine of Kybela107 and several pieces are specific Bosporan statuettes with suspended limbs, which are connected with the Kybela cult by a number of scholars. 108 So, in the course of the second to third centuries the great goddess and the cavalier god advance to the foreground in the religious beliefs of the rural population of the Bosporan kingdom. The images of the sitting woman with a high headdress, grotesque figurines with sus- pended limbs, and images of mounted warriors dominate among the terracottas, while idol-like figurines of the goddess are the most nu- merous of handmade clay statuettes. Handmade figurines of horsemen were also found on some sites.109 The cult of the supreme cavalier god, companion of the great god- dess, which existed in the south Russian steppes as early as the Scyth- ian period, by the beginning of the common era must have advanced to the foreground, and the male deity began to dominate in the pair. It must be noted that the spread of the images of the horse and the horseman and their supplanting of the images of other deities at the end of the first millennium B.C. and in the first centuries A.D. was going on not only on the northern Black Sea littoral but also in Central Asia and in Transcaucasia as a result of the growing popularity of the cults of the solar god, deified ancestor, and the horse brought by the Iranian nomads.110 The same phenomenon may be observed in India after the appearance of the Saka there.1ll The worship of the solar cavalier god was obviously one of the basic religious traditions of the Iranians. 105 A.

Widengren has emphasized the links between the Iranian ideas of the sun, Ahura-Mazda, and the horse;112 these links corroborated both linguistic and archaeological materials.113 The explanation lies in the Prezoroastrian beliefs of the ancient Iranians, the religious traditions of the Sarmatians and the Iranian tribes of Central Asia being very close.114 Long before the appearance of the prophet, the Iranian cult of various "ahura" showed a tendency toward "merging into a monothe- istic cult of the Supreme Ahura with the epitheton 'Mazda'-'wise."' 115 Some scholars believe that Ahura-Mazda himself was worshiped at that time.116 Traces of the merging of Ahura-Mazda with the sun are found in "Avesta."117 Nevertheless, it is too dangerous to claim that the solar god of the Massagetes is Ahura-Mazda.118 He could have been Mithra or some other complex deity, as Mithra was also closely connected with the sun and later became a solar deity.119 The pair deity Mithra-Ahura, equiva- lent to the Vedic pair Mitra-Varuna, was worshiped by the Iranians since ancient times.120 Numerous manifestations of the fire cult were also connected with this deity. The ancient Iranians conceived their supreme solar god as a horse- man.121 But the cult of the cavalier god was widespread in Eurasia from Germany to China,122 and different gods and heroes were represented as horsemen.123 Having studied the typology of the Roman cavalier 112 G.

Scheftolowitz ("Die Mithra-Religion der Indo- Skythen und ihre Beziehung zum Saura und Mithra-Kult," Acta orientalia 11 [1933]: 295-97) has put forward the following hypothesis: having adopted Zoroastrianism in the Achaemenid epoch, the Saka began to worship Ahura-Mazda as the supreme deity, but in the image of Mithra, who had been known to them long before. It resulted in an amal- gamation of the images of the two gods. 121 Representation and cult of the horseman cannot be interpreted on the basis of the most ancient Indo-Iranian mythology. Both "Rig-veda" and "Avesta" usually mention carriages (Kuz'mina [n. 11 above], p. 107). The appearance of horsemen is connected with the spread of cavalry tactics in battle in Eurasia by the beginning of the first millen- nium B.C. Only then could the anthropomorphic images of cavalier gods and heroes ap- pear in the ideology. 122 Rostovtzeff, "Bog-vsadnik na juge Rossii, v Indo-Skifii i v Kitaje" (n. 110 above); E. Will, Le relief cultuel greco-romain (Paris, 1955), pp. 56-125. 123 Will, p. 104; L. Robert, Hellenica (Paris, 1946), 3:56, and 7:57. 174</page><page sequence="26">History of Religions reliefs, E. Will inferred that the deities appear as cavaliers not because they are such by their nature or because their worshipers are always mounted but because they perform an action that demands a horse: fighting evil or hunting, that is, chasing evil forces. The cavalier god struggles against world evil; he is defender and savior, the supreme guardian of justice.124 But the functions of the Iranian supreme solar god were exactly the same. Thus, the monotheistic tendency has evidently been present in the development of the Sarmatian religious concepts, and it is the Iranian tradition that explains the monotheistic trend in the cult of Theos Hyp- sistos. The image of the Most High God may have been related to the idea of the pair deity Mithra-Ahura, some hints to duality being traced in the Bosporan deity.125 This supreme solar god, defender and fighter against evil, was represented as a horseman in the Iranian world. Bosporus was no exception. The Greco-Roman element must have played some role in the emer- gence of Theos Hypsistos, but "hellenization" of the deity has not been deep. Indeed, the formal organization in Greek thiasoi seems to have covered traditional Iranian associations.126 What was the name of the god whose image has developed into that of Theos Hypsistos? A story told by Iamblichos may be conducive to the solving of the problem ('Iap3Xiyou ApaPaTtKov 9, second century). He narrates in detail about Pharnouchos, Pharsiris, and Tanais, who gave name to the river Tanais, and tells that the mysteries of Aphro- dite in this country and in the area of Tanais are the mysteries of Tanais and Pharsiris. The root "pharn" is evident in the name "Pharnouchsos," and "Pharsiris" means "with shining face."127 Phar- siris must have been the solar deity, and Pharnouchos was related to "pharn," one of the basic concepts in the Iranian ideology, compre- hending grace, power, happiness, and good luck.128 Aphrodite was the local incarnation of the great goddess. So the Iranian divine triad ap- pears,l29 which was sometimes conceived as a pair consisting of a male and a female deity. 124 Will, p. 124. We are thus forced to infer that it is impossible to connect automati- cally the genesis of one cavalier god with another, i.e., the Bosporan horseman with his Thracian and Danubian counterparts. The concepts of cavalier gods may have emerged independently or in parallel under the influence of the same concepts-in our case, the Iranian concept of divine horseman. 125 Compare Rostovtzeff, "Predstavlenija o monarkhicheskoj vlasti v Skifii i na Bos- pore" (n. 14 above), pp. 11-13; above, p. 174. 126 See below, p. 176. 127 Smirov, Savromaty (n. 11 above), p. 250. 128 V.

One may suppose that the pair Pharsiris-Aphro- dite is equivalent to Theos Hypsistos-great goddess, whose worship is documented with a great number of monuments from Tanais and other sites on the northern Black Sea littoral. The role of Tanais, who was worshiped by the Sarmatians, according to Iamblichos and other ancient writers (Pseudo-Plutarchus, De fluviis 14; Maximus Tyrius, Oratio 8.8), is rather curious. Salac thought the Day of Tanais to be an anniversary of the reconstruction of the town af- ter the Polemon's crushing,130 but this idea seems less probable than a suggestion that the Day of Tanais was the day of the god Tanais, since in ancient times the day of any town could be celebrated only as a day dedicated to the divine patron of this town. Participation of a special "committee" of thiasitai in the organization of such a festival may be explained by the fact that some relations may have existed between Tanais and the precursor of Theos Hypsistos, if it was Pharsiris. As Theos Hypsistos was primarily the Iranian solar god and there were so many Sarmatians among his worshipers, one may envisage the structure of thiasoi in quite a different way. As already noted above, the exclusively male composition of the Tanais thiasoi and a number of magistratures distinguishes them from the "normal" Greek or Ro- man private cult associations. Rostovtzeff regarded the Bosporan thiasoi as military organizations and sacral and political citizen associations.131 Meanwhile, a hypothesis that the Iranian tradition of Mdnnerbiinde underlies the structure of the Bosporan synodoi explains all these pecu- liarities.132 S. Wikander demonstrated that the written sources, and "Avesta" first of all, contain evidence of these ancient Iranian socie- ties.133 He has paid special attention to the connection of men's societies to the cult of Mithra.134 According to Wikander, men's societies were ecstatic cults, the drinking of Haoma being one of their major rituals (cf. the rhyton held by the god on the Tanais stela and the evidence on mys- teries celebrated in the town); the cult of the deceased was an important 130 Salac (n. 23 above), pp. 216-17; asserted by A.

V. Trever, age classes, which were closely related to the men's societies, existed in Achaemenid Persia.137 The Parthian warrior socie- ties are studied in detail by Widengren.138 So, both literary sources and modern ethnographic data prove the existence of Iranian Mdnnerbiinde. But there is evidence directly con- cerning the ancient Iranian nomads. Herodotus (4.26) tells about the custom of Massagetes to eat their old men, which certainly reflects the existence of age classes.139 The Hippocratic corpus contains an indica- tion that "there are a lot of eunuchs, who are occupied with women's work and speak women's language" (De aeris 29). The languages that were kept secret from the opposite sex and the strict division of occu- pations into those proper for men and women is indicative of the exis- tence of Mdnnerbiinde. Activity of the men's societies covered exactly those spheres that are supposed by the titles of thiasoi officials: military and athletic training (gymnasiarchos), supervising of boys and teenagers (neaniskarchos), strict control over the members' morals (philagathos and paraphilaga- thos), common cult (hiereus), and general guidance (presbuteros, pa- ter). As these titles are Greek equivalents of corresponding Iranian notions, they could not have been absolutely accurate. Incorporation of an ancient Iranian institution into the social struc- ture of the Bosporan kingdom demanded its reorganization and helle- nization.140 Indeed, the amazing terminological uniformity is certainly 135 Wikander, Der arische Mannerbiind, pp. 64-65, 69-74, 76, 78, 79, and 94. 136 S.

The use of the Greek terms and some organizational princi- ples made the Iranian institution acceptable to the Greeks. The nearly universal belonging of Tanais men to thiasoi is also ex- plained: Mdnnerbinde had to embrace all the men who enjoyed full rights. Thus, by the beginning of the common era the cult associations ap- peared to be the most effective form of military training and ideologi- cal organization of citizens in the Bosporan kingdom. Preservation of these societies, however modified, in the Bosporan kingdom is not sur- prising: this form of social organization demonstrated its astonishing steadiness, having outlasted the epoch of its appearance by millennia. One may remember the conservation of numerous features of Manner- biinde in the everyday life of the Central Asian Tadjiks and Uzbeks in the second half of the twentieth century, to say nothing of the evident system of age classes in Achaemenid Persia. Some scholars cite the Mithraic associations of the Imperial period as another example of modification of the Iranian men's societies.142 There is nearly nothing definite to be said about the performance of the Theos Hypsistos cult in Tanais. But the only complex that is to be interpreted as pertinent to the cults may be related to the cult of Theos Hypsistos. In a cellar of an exedra-type chamber of a second-third century house in the northeastern corner of the site, among the other objects, a limestone altar, seven clay stamps, five portable incense burners, six lamps, and a small hearth were found,143 the altar, stamps, and incense burners having been in the cellar at the moment of the de- struction of the building. As a parallel, one may cite two Chersonesos cult cellars, where altars and lamps have also been found.144 Since, first, images of eagles decorate a number of stelae of the Tanais thiasitai, and eagles clutching snakes are on the Panticapaeum clay stamps145 and on the cult table from Cytaeum, and second, Theos Hypsistos and Theos Bronton Epekoos are identical in his opinion, Shelov suggested that stamps were also used in the cult of Theos Hyp- sistos and that this cult convened in the cellar.146 The only obstacle to 141 Ibid. 142 Widengren, "The Mithraic Mysteries of the Greco-Roman World," pp. 434, 446- 52; Beskow (n. 132 above), p. 19. 143 Shelov (n. 3 above), pp. 285-86. 144 Ibid., p. 288. 145 Tzekhmistrenko (n. 86 above), pp. 279-82. 146 Shelov, p. 288. 178</page><page sequence="30">History of Religions this theory was the presence of chthonic features in this cult (they are supposed by the use of the underground sanctuary), but Shelov con- nected them with the chthonic features in the Zeus Bronton cult. It has been mentioned above that the identification of the Cytaeum god and Theos Hypsistos does not seem doubtless. Clay stamps were widely used throughout the ancient world and in the Bosporan king- dom in particular, for example, in the great goddess cult. Thus, Tanais stamps may have belonged to the cult of this goddess. As to the use of this cellar and maybe some others, cellars could well be used in the Theos Hypsistos cult. As already noted, chthonic features are evident in the cult of Iranian Mannerbunde. Then, Mithra was worshiped in a cave in Persia (Firmicus' Maternus, De errore profanarum religionum 5), as well as in the Roman mystery religion, and Mithreum itself was conceived as a cave by Mithraists.147 The presence of caves in the cult of the Iranian solar god appears to be an ancient Iranian element and not a Roman innovation. There are no caves in the neighborhood of Tanais, and it would have been quite natural if the inhabitants of the town exchanged cellars for caves. The Mithraists acted so as well, con- structing some special dark chambers if there were no natural caves at hand. Another cellar in the southwestern part of the site is also very curi- ous. The cellar was used in the second century, earlier than the build- ing itself. It was filled up with fragments of raw brick and pottery, and in this debris a terracotta figurine of an eagle was discovered.148 Similar terracotta was found in a second-third century cellar in Olbia. 147 F.

(The Hague, 1956-60). 148 Compare the eagle carrying the image of Theos Hypsistos from the Serdica shrine (see above, p. 156). Most interesting is the ritual burial of eighteen rams in the filling of this cellar (Shelov, p. 289). One more burial of a ram in a pit of a Tanais cellar also seems to be ritual (T. M. Arsen'jeva, "Raboty v Tanaise," in Arkheologicheskije otkrytija [Moscow, 1972], pp. 110-12). Similar ritual ram burials have been known in Neapolis Scythica (T. N. Vysotskaja, "Kul'ty i obrjady pozdnikh skifov," Vestnik Drevnej Istorii 3 [1976]: 60) and on the Kozyrka site (A. V. Burakov, "Gorodishche bilja s. Kozyrki poblizu Ol'vii," in Arkheologichni pam"jatki URSR [Kiev, 1962], 11:73-74). Both in Kozyrka and in Tanais lamps were found in these burials. Indeed, lamps must have played some role in the Tanais cults. In Neapolis bones of five rams were found together with fragments of cult vessels and statuettes in the building "E," which is related to cult purposes (Vysotskaja). It is worth noting that it was in Kozyrka that the relief of a horse- man before a standing woman was found (above, p. 167). The ram played an important role in Iranian beliefs. Rams are predominant on zoomorphic handles of Sarmatian ves- sels (Litvinski [n. 111 above], pp. 6-7, 92). Litvinski traced the relations between the concept of "pharn," which was extremely important for the Iranians, and the image of the ram, considered an incarnation of the pharn, in the culture of the Central Asian peo- ples, the Ossetians and, finally, the Sarmatians (pp. 59-74). Thus, ritual burials of rams appear to be linked with Iranian beliefs, although it is impossible to claim their direct re- lation to the cult of Theos Hypsistos. 179</page><page sequence="31">The Thiasoi of Theos Hypsistos in Tanais R I. Vetstein related it to the Jupiter-worship of Roman legion- naires.149 Two statuettes of the same type, made of Panticapaeum clay, were found on the territory of the Bosporan kingdom. It is highly tempting to connect the Tanais figurine with the images of eagles on the thiasitai stelae. Well known is the role of the eagle as a companion of the supreme Indo-European deity, his symbol and of- ten his personification.150 However, the eagle was an attribute of the majority of solar and supreme deities,151 and one cannot claim the Tanais terracotta to be pertinent to the cult of Theos Hypsistos without any doubt. The conception set forth in the present article is certainly far from being grounded exhaustively. New archaeological finds or new ap- proaches to the existing data may change the situation substantially. But the present state of the problem forces one to admit the decisive role of the Iranian background in the emergence of the cult of Theos Hypsistos in the Bosporan kingdom, its ideology and organization be- ing, of course, hellenized and transformed under the influence of both general cultural and religious tendencies of the Imperial period and the specific Bosporan conditions.
