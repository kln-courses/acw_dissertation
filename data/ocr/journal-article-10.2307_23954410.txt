<plain_text><page sequence="1">Radical Radical Monotheism and Western Culture. By H. Richard Niebuhr. Pp. 144. London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1962. 18s. This volume contains the Montgomery Lectures on Contemporary Civilization, given at the University of Nebraska in 1957, together with four so-called Supplementary Essays written on various occasions. It is an obscure, but extremely rewarding book. Its readers might be well advised to begin with the third Supplementary Essay (pp. 114 ff.), where its author openly engages with the problem—How is faith in God possible?—and provides a summary introduction to his theological outlook. The Montgomery Lectures themselves comprise a highly concen trated essay of 79 pages in the dialectic whereby, through the criticism of what Niebuhr calls henotheism and polytheism, the God 'who is principle of being' is affirmed. Niebuhr devotes more attention to the various forms of henotheism than he does to the different styles of</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 257 metaphysical pluralism, coupled very often with a deeply individual spiritual yearning (illustrated early in the book by an extended reference to Tolstoy's My Confession), with which he seems to identify poly theism, and which he sometimes presents as the antithesis of henotheism. (Here again, however, one of the Supplementary Essays, viz. that on The The Center of Value (pp. 100 ff.), demands to be read as an appendix to the account given of polytheism in the body of the lectures.) It is clear that he has studied deeply the ethical writings of Josiah Royce and is convinced of the relevance to the understanding of the faith-commit ment of the henotheist, whether religious or secular, of that philosopher's analysis of the notion of loyalty. The dialectic, which he traces with commanding subtlety and wealth of illustration, is presented in such concentrated form that it hardly admits of summary; but the author displays throughout a remarkable virtuosity in the interweaving in his argument of references to matters of theology (e.g. the covenant rela tion, the tension between the theocentric and the Christocentric viewpoints), questions of epistemology (e.g. the criticism of the meta physical by the empiricist conception of human knowledge, Professor Michael Polanyi's thesis concerning the ethical matrix of scientific research), and of political theory (e.g. the limits of sovereignty, the rights of conscientious objection). Full weight of credit must be given to this admirable comprehensiveness of vision. What remains obscure is the status afforded to the God of radical monotheism, this God whom Niebuhr identifies with the 'principle of being' and who bears a more than family resemblance to Tillich's 'God beyond gods'. At times Niebuhr treats the concept of this God as something akin to a Kantian 'regulative idea', indispensable to the dialectical criticism of loyalties, institutions, and traditions, without which religion, culture, and morality must decay. Although it is fair to speak of polytheism as the antithesis of henotheism, it should be recognized that the movement of Niebuhr's dialectic is Platonic rather than Hegelian, and that in many passages he assigns to the God of radical monotheism a role inviting description as that of a goal which is never reached, but which yet furnishes the dialectical movement with its elan. Yet the very fact that Niebuhr speaks of this God as a 'principle of being' brings out his unwillingness to assign to his concept a merely regulative function; in some sense in him we deal with what is, and have to deal with it, moreover, at all levels in the rich complexity of human existence, whether we turn our attention to thought, to issues of personal morality, to conflicts of collective obligation. Occasionally Niebuhr discusses the manner of his revelation in Christ; but these passages are neither frequent nor sustained enough to bring out clearly 781.1 S</page><page sequence="3">258 REVIEWS the place of a Christology in Niebuhr's definitely theocentric struc ture. The strength of this very interesting book resides in the emphasis with which its author presents the being and nature of God as the central theme of theology, and by his practice bears witness to the extent to which such a preoccupation enlarges the theologian's horizons in all directions. It is clear that like other acute, contemporary thinkers, whose concerns are with the centre and not with the minutiae of the theo logical periphery, he looks to the use of generalized ontological cate gories to deliver his treatment of his chosen theme from every taint of anthropomorphism, whether individual or collective. Yet apart from a brief reference to M. Etienne Gilson's treatment of Exod. iii. 14 (pp. 42, 44) and a glancing critical bow towards the category of sub stance (p. 114), he leaves himself without any historical treatment of the chapter of the corpus philosophicum called traditionally ontology, or any account of its complex relation to characteristically Christian theology. Consequently the reader is left with an uneven understanding of the role of the treatment of God as 'principle of being' in the richly complex intellectual and moral awareness of the believer and the theologian; he is also frankly bewildered concerning what sense, if any, can be assigned to this formula in itself, and indeed why precisely (apart from a desire to bring out that he is dealing with that which is) the author uses the phrase. In the Supplementary Essay on Faith Niebuhr emphasizes that his commitment as a Protestant theologian leads him to treat the question —Does God exist ?—as secondary to that—How is faith in God possible ? (p. 116). Yet his eagerness to employ ontological categories shows that he takes this secondary question with great seriousness and that unlike, for instance, Bultmann, he is not content with a theology whose data are ultimately furnished by a complex act of introspection, providing the theologian with the task of laying bare their structure. (It must be emphasized that this book is singularly rich in its comment on the interior conflict of the believer; for Niebuhr, dialectic is not a matter of the detached intellect, but of total human existence.) Yet it remains unrevealed how he does achieve and justify the transition he makes from a subtle concentration on subjective existence to affirmation concerning what is. The student of the theological method of Karl Barth, with its deep indebtedness to Anselm (as Barth understands Anselm), is able to understand how, in spite of his polemics against analogia entis, that theologian is enabled by his radical methodological Christocentrism to speak confidently in terms of what is. But this is not Niebuhr's way; indeed, his conception of the theologian's task, and of the relations of</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 259 theology to philosophy, is radically different from Barth's. It is then a serious sin of omission on his part to leave his invocation of onto logical categories, at a point absolutely crucial for his argument, so little elaborated, let alone justified. Yet this central inadequacy, no more than the density, amounting to real obscurity, of parts of the argument does not detract from the value and importance of this work. It is a contribution to the renewed defini tion of the problem of the existence and nature of God, which possibly, even more than closely related issues of Christology, demands articula tion if theological studies are to fulfil in this present a valid and intel ligible and a significant role.
