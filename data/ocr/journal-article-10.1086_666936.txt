<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 372 booK reviews Facing the Gods: Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature  and Religion. By verity platt. Cambridge and new York: Cambridge University  Press, 2011. Pp. [xviii] + 482. The subject of epiphany is of central importance to the proper understanding of  the role of the gods in Graeco-roman culture, and Verity Platt offers a wide-ranging  study of many of its diverse aspects. Chapters address the representation of divini- ties in Greek relief sculpture, the invocation of the gods in the Homeric Hymns, the  complex character of Greek cult statues, the relationship of vision and representation  in both art and literature (particularly the epigram), the role of paideia in the tradition  of sacred images and their place in later Greek culture, the myriad accounts of the ap- pearance of divinities in dreams, and the relationship with the gods evoked on certain  mythological sarcophagi. each chapter is conceived in the form of a case study, yet all  of them range widely and are marked by interesting observations on the broad array of  materials treated. The author’s wide reading in the numerous relevant ancillary fields  has allowed her to formulate an impressive set of examples in an ambitious effort to  set the idea of epiphany in its full cultural context. it must be said at the outset that the book is challenging. its subject matter is  complex, its presentation is often difficult to follow, and its arguments are not always  easy to comprehend. P. tackles her subject from different angles, by means of the  examination of different evidence, yet these, in large measure, fail to coalesce as a  whole. synthesis does not seem to have been the book’s goal—and thus it is a study  that might be most rewarding when read in parts, according to an interest in its varied  topics, for the book has a number of stimulating discussions, notably those concerning  Phidias’ Parthenos and its relationship to the ancient Polias statue (pp. 86–100), Ar- temidorus’ treatment of dreams (pp. 275–99), and Philostratus’ account of the colossus  of memnon (pp. 299–312). P. makes three broad claims. First, in antiquity, there were different strategies for  making the gods present to mortals, and the sacred image—the professed focus of P.’s  inquiry—provides a distinctive aspect of our evidence for understanding the ancients’  relationship with their gods and the culture in which that relationship was played  out (p. 17; cf. p. 85). second, there was a distinct “discourse” concerning epiphany,  one which depended on the mediating role of representations “in the formation and  communication of such epiphanies” (p. 23), hence the special attention given to “the  sophisticated thematics of vision and representation” (p. 25). And third, that the rep- resentation of divine manifestations within the context of ritual should be regarded  as what P. terms “theology in action” (p. 39), since “the images themselves. . . . can  simultaneously symbolise and constitute divine presence” (p. 47). The reader’s ability  to assess these claims is complicated by the fact that P. does not argue them directly;  rather, they form the continuing threads that run through the chapters. moreover, none  of these claims is really novel, and while this is acknowledged in the notes, this fact is  obfuscated by P.’s presentation of her views in a prose style that, as it clings to recent  intellectual paradigms and formulations, inflects her treatment of the book’s topics  with a somewhat misleading sense of their intellectual currency. Any book of such grand ambition as this one has its inevitable shortcomings. This  study is hardly to be construed as a “history” of epiphany (as its dust jacket proclaims),  if, indeed, a proper history—that is, more than a mere catalogue of testimonia—might  be written at all. The author attempts, with some success, to integrate the book’s  </page> <page sequence="2"> booK reviews 373 various case studies, largely on the basis of certain overarching “theoretical” concerns,  but this is often at the expense of the discrete and individuated character of the differ- ent examples of the phenomenon that form the basis of the book’s chapters. There is  repeated invocation of a series of topoi (presence/absence; “thematics of vision”; the  “blurring” of boundaries between various categories; deferral) by means of which such  generalized conclusions are formulated, yet these are often presented as if their heu- ristic value and their historical purchase are self-evident. Platitudes are rehearsed with  disconcerting self-confidence (e.g., on third-century modes of representation [p. 27],  “naturalistic” style [p. 33 and passim], “formalist strategies” [p. 41], etc.). rhetorical  description of both texts and images is often presented as sufficient argument. not  everyone will be persuaded that this is adequate. What follows addresses, briefly, three fundamental aspects of this study, aspects  whose continuous appearance in the various chapters suggest that these constitute the  core of what this reviewer perceives to be the book’s basic arguments. These con- cern (1) the variety of ways that the very idea of the appearance of the gods marked  literature, art, and cult practice in Graeco-roman antiquity; (2) the significance of a  sequence of claims about the role of “naturalism” in the history of epiphany and its  representations (p. 198); and (3) the importance of “vision”—or, as the author would  have it, a variety of kinds of vision—in this history. First, the idea that the gods appear to mortals. The book’s treatment of the topic  is inconsistent, and often, in self-contradictory fashion, appeals to an unfounded idea  of immediacy, which is offered, at times, as the central and defining characteristic of  epiphany. it is, of course, hard to argue that the gods really did appear, yet this is at  times asserted: see, for example, “seemingly unmediated visual encounter” (p. 48);  epiphany “as a form of unmediated encounter” (p. 54); Zeus’ empty throne allows  the god “to interpolate himself in a seemingly unmediated fashion” (p. 103); “a sense  of direct encounter” (p. 174); “unmediated access to the gods” (p. 363). What does  it mean to take seriously a claim to have experienced the “unmediated appearance”  of the gods? While P. acknowledges the problems posed by “supposed first-hand”  accounts (p. 7), she also speaks of “the authenticity of the worshippers’ experience  of divine felicity” (p. 38), and the widespread epigraphical testimonia to epiphaneia  (p. 150); but in what sense can such assertions serve as the foundation for historical  analysis? The innate solipsism of claims to have witnessed a god’s epiphany is obvi- ous, and the presentation of such testimonia as prima facie evidence for epiphany is  troubling in historical study. This goes beyond an avowal that the very concept of  epiphany is “problematic,” and the invocation of the presumptive authority of notions  like “cognitive dissonance” or “cognitive reliability” (pp. 56, 83, 85, 226), so redolent  of the language of the social sciences, does not suffice as the basis of an explanation.  On the one hand, what can it mean to speak of “varying degrees of epiphanic pres- ence” (p. 41), or to suggest that in the sanctuary “divinity is fully manifest” (p. 36),  and on the other, to declare that “humans can only know the gods by means of repre- sentations” (p. 53), only to acknowledge that their immediacy is lost in representation  (p. 59)? it seems hardly a “paradox” that deities “appeared” to individuals in the  forms known from their representations (cf. pp. 74, 226, 258, 265, 290, 392), an  idea that owes much, as P. acknowledges, to an essay by richard Gordon of more  than thirty years ago (p. 78): but how else might the gods have appeared, and how  would they have been recognized and their appearance acknowledged? P. labors amidst  </page> <page sequence="3"> 374 booK reviews such contradictions to recuperate the very notion of epiphany: statues might “simulate  epiphany” (p. 89), or language might “facilitate a form of indirect epiphany” (pp. 4–8;  cf. p. 57). she speaks of “a paradox that is negotiated by all sacred images in Greek  culture—between their phenomenological effect (when they are experienced as a form  of epiphany) and their ontological status (that is, their material and representational  nature, their existence as objects)” (p. 82). But what can one say of the ancients’  belief in the ontological status of divinity itself—or are we to hold that the gods only  appear—at times immaterially (in dreams, pp. 258, 263), at times materially (cf. p. 87,  on the Parthenos as “the quintessential material manifestation of divinity”)? second, naturalism. Throughout the book P. repeatedly deploys the idea of a “natu- ralistic style,” although precisely how this style might be defined is never articulated.  it is used without qualification to describe works of art dating from the mid-fifth to the  end of the fourth century b.c.e. (statues, reliefs, and even paintings), yet its cogency  as a descriptive classification, its transparency as a heuristic category, and its function  as an aspect of ideology are all merely assumed. most of the time it seems simply to  signal something like a notion of convincing anthropomorphism (e.g., a reference to  the “here and now,” p. 36; “implicitly contiguous with the realm of the mortal viewer,”  p. 117; “when representation can so easily be viewed as ‘reality,’” p. 198). As a commonplace view this is far from unusual; but here it forms the basis for  further, specific claims about the naturalistic style’s “mimetic” (p. 72) and ultimately  its “epiphanic” potential (p. 114). much of this is apparently built upon richard Woll- heim’s distinction between “seeing in” and “seeing as” (pp. 47–48), with the former  category—that which allows that one may see something in a representation while at  the same time acknowledging that it is a representation—held by P. to be a “defining  feature of naturalism” (cf. pp. 82 and 392; 211). Yet the relevance of this claim about naturalism to the problem of epiphany is not  entirely convincing. P. certainly does not claim that the naturalistic representation of  anthropomorphic gods might have a trompe l’oeil effect—for if one is fooled by an  image, one fails to recognize it as an image. But, while the association of naturalism  with epiphany is raised again and again, at moments in P.’s exposition the opposite  is said to be true. her explanation of a structural opposition (pp. 96–100) relies on a  claim that Archaic forms, such as the Palladion—which “did not evoke a sense of the  epiphanic through the divine radiance attributed to naturalistic forms or precious met- als”—are conceived as having made an “epiphanic arrival”: “arrival from ‘elsewhere’  asserts the gods’ power to materialise their own presence within the physical world”  (p. 97). if even an ancient xoanon, rudimentary in form, might be comprehended as  constituting the god’s epiphany—and thus, presumably, as a material form that the  god might be “seen in”—what power does a claim for the role of naturalism have? Third, and finally, vision. There are, in fact, numerous “visions” that play a role in  P.’s account, all of which form part of an assertion that there exist a variety of “modes  of viewing,” a formulation that has been the subject of a good deal of discussion in  recent years. in this instance it may be a matter of context, as in the case of “ritual  viewing” (p. 47; cf. p. 50 on a contrast between “ritual and aesthetic modes of view- ing”); of purpose, as with what is termed “connoisseurial viewing” (p. 172; cf. p. 133);  or merely a series of metaphors for various aspects of cognition, as with “verbal view- ing” (p. 208), “imaginative viewing” (p. 324), and “theoric viewing” (p. 327). While  such discriminations enjoy a significant role in many of P.’s discussions, whether these  </page> <page sequence="4"> booK reviews 375 actually pertain to vision—to how one looks at things—is less than certain. in fact, in  some instances, it is clear that the focus is not “viewing” at all. it is the notion of “verbal viewing” that plays the most critical function throughout  P.’s book, and it is the one “mode” that demands justification. While there can be  little disagreement with the claim that language “triggers” the imagination (p. 217; cf.  p. 329), the idea that this is a form of “viewing”—and more than a metaphor—requires  justification rather than mere assertion. much of this revolves around the paragone of  text and image, and the author’s explicit belief in the “the limits of the visual . . . and  . . . the superiority” of literature (p. 203). But does reading a description of viewing constitute the same experience as ac- tual seeing? This seems to be a central claim: “a mode of viewing within the text”  (p. 198); “the text’s scenes of viewing” (p. 298); discussion of Callimachus revolves  around “the act of viewing the statue he describes (p. 183; cf., similarly, p. 204). The  proposition is pressed to extremes: “While experiences of enargeia or phantasia can  be generated by literary or artistic representation, provoking secondary forms of vi- sion such as that experienced in the ‘mind’s eye’, they can also constitute the primary  visual experiences that inspire such verbal or visual representations in the first place”  (p. 231). One wonders whether this too counts as an epiphany.  Michael Koortbojian   Princeton University Everyday Writing in the Graeco-Roman East. By roger s. bagnall.

Two naves with piers and arches were plastered and 105 areas of plaster survive.  Originally there were at least two layers, covered with graffiti. much has been lost  as plaster fell or surface cleaning removed the writing, yet “a mass of drawings and  texts remains” (p. 9). B. presents examples of different kinds—sexual, amatory, po- litical, sporting, magical, and cryptic—from a number estimated at several thousand  (p. 10). There are word squares and ciphers, numerous references to eye-diseases and  healing, and some that are probably Christian. As the upper layer includes a graffito  dated to 125–126 c.e., an apparently Christian one on the lower layer has to be earlier  (pp. 22–23). some graffiti are scratched, some written with black ink or paint, height- ened occasionally with red, and some with charcoal. The question of why anyone  would enter this basement lies open: was the place simply a substructure, a storage  area, a refuge from summer heat, or, as B. suggests (on the basis of the messages about  healing), a route to a spring and a shrine? Those messages stand apart from the banal  and amatory, common to most collections of graffiti, as do the many drawings of ships. </page> </plain_text>
