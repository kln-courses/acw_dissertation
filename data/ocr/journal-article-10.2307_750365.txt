<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIVA MATRIX A faked gnostic intaglio in the possession of P. P. Rubens and the iconology of a symbol By A. A. Barb I. "Those wretched subjects" Only recently an American professor deemed it necessary to explain to the readers of an international review devoted to the history of science and civilization "why a serious scholar might spend years on the study of wretched subjects like ancient astrology."1 He found it easy to show with a few words the manifold importance of such studies, the gratifying amount of work done during the last two generations,2 and the promises held out for the future. Much the same could be said about similar subjects as, for example, the study of the magical papyri.3 Less progress has been made, however, where "wretched objects" were concerned. Here the disappearance of the old-fashioned "antiquary," outdone and discredited by the more fashionable "historian" (who now in turn might expect a similar fate from the social anthropologist) has left a regrettable vacuum.4 One of the most important classes of these neglected objects are the peculiar engraved stones known as "Abraxas" or "Gnostic" gems. They were eagerly collected and studied in the seventeenth century (when-1657-J. Chiflet published his and L'Heureux' studies on this subject), but fell gradually into contempt when Humanism turned into Classicism. Censured by Goethe5 at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the "Abraxas" are treated with disgust by competent archaeologists in the middle of the century,6 and when towards its end Adolf Furtwaingler catalogued the engraved gems of the Berlin Antiquarium7 he insisted that this group of stones, which did so little credit to the history of classical glyptic art,8 be removed to the Department of Egyptology. The same thing happened at about the same time in London. In both places the result was what might be called a third-class funeral, consisting in short summary lists being inserted in the guide-books of the Egyptian collections.9 The Berlin Egyptologists "wussten mit diesen . . . Stiicken nichts Rechtes anzufangen" as one of their experts admitted frankly in 1934.10 About the same time the British Museum decided again to remove their "gnostic gems" from the Department of Egyptian (and Assyrian) Antiquities.'" Scholars of the last generation who occasionally needed some information about "Abraxas" gems found themselves referred to out-of-the-way and obsolete publications,'2 with- out competent guidance, unable to distinguish between reliable reproduction, misrepresentation and forgery, between sound interpretation and wild guess- work. This has now suddenly changed. The excellent book published on the subject by Campbell Bonnerl3 not only makes the fullest use of practically everything relevant published in books, catalogues and periodicals of three centuries about these "wretched" objects; it also adds the author's own profound erudition, sound criticism and the thorough examination of many hundreds of original stones, so providing scholars of a variety of related sub- Notes I to 13, see p. 213- 193</page><page sequence="2">194 A. A. BARB jects with an astonishing wealth of information and the foundations for further fruitful research. In his book Bonner also deals thoroughly with a fairly common type of such gems, featuring the symbol of the womb.14 The characteristically shaped object as shown here, P1. 25a, on four specimens in the British Museum15 has been explained by scholars in turn as a stove or furnace,16 as the "vessel of sins" balanced in some gnostic psychostasia,"' as a pot of an hydraulic wheel of the kind used on the Nile,18 as a musical instrument (pneumatic organ),19 or as the reliquary containing the head of Osiris.20 But A. Delatte established its real meaning in 1914 beyond any doubt;21 it is a reasonably realistic representation of the uterus (mitra) with a key22 applied to its mouth-a charm for safe childbirth and against the manifold ailments of the female sex organ.23 Still, as Bonner observed rightly,24 even in our days "the title 'Nilotic Vessel' vies with 'Vase of Sins' on the labels in our museums" whenever these uterus-amulets are described. 2. Antiquaries of the seventeenth century Under these circumstances it is particularly interesting that some seven- teenth-century scholars apparently had no doubts about the right interpreta- tion of this image25-a useful reminder perhaps for modern scholars that it might occasionally be worth while carefully to re-examine theories and sug- gestions of those bygone centuries before accepting the latest learned stunt. Bonner refers to the correspondence of P. P. Rubens, the painter, with N. C. F. de Peiresc, the antiquarian and scientist, in the year 1623.26 Peiresc had presented Rubens with four engraved gems, one of which he describes as "intaglio d'amethista con la vulva2" deificata et revestita delle ale difarfalla."28 In a previous letter he gives a more detailed description of the gem in question.29 The uterus ("matrice") is engraved on the reverse of the stone, standing on a base, on the panel ("vano") of which one sees a cock and a phallus with legs; round the uterus there is a legend eEAF MHTP.30 The obverse shows a winged phallus, again on a base, on which the apotropaic sign of the "fig" ("una mano che passa il pollice tra l'indice et l'altro ditto prossimo") is engraved; to the right and the left of the base one sees a cock and a snail, an inscription round the phallus reads eEOT r A IYOTHPOZ.31 Rubens in his acknowledgment32 expresses his delight with Peiresc's valuable gift which he is reluctant to accept. He was particularly pleased with "la diva vulva colle ale di papilioni" and he draws a sketch of this detail, the winged, deified uterus, on the margin of his letter (here reproduced P1. 25d).33 He confesses however not to be able to make out "che cosa sia quello che tra l'altare et la bocca dessa vulva roversciata" -obviously the teeth of the original key or what the engraver, who apparently also failed to understand their meaning, had left of them. There are, however, as pointed out by Bonner, two difficulties of inter- pretation in this correspondence. The first difficulty is that Peiresc refers to what is obviously the same gem in his letter of July 20 as being "di pietra sanguinea," but in the letter of July 27, as we saw, as "intaglio d'amethista"; Bonner suggests "that the inconsistency concerning the material is due to a Notes 14 to 33, see pp. 2 13-215.</page><page sequence="3">25 a-Four Haematite Gems with Uterus and Key Symbol, British Museum (Inv.

Both names are used for the same material, viz. haematite (red iron ore), from which practically all these uterine amulets were cut,35 pietra sanguinea being the correct transla- tion for Latin Haematites (from Greek oatrtu; = "blood-stone"), while amet(h)ista (just as amatista, amatita, ametito, ematita, matita)36 are perverted derivations from the original Greek.37 The similarity of these latter deriva- tions with the name of the transparent purple variety of quartz called "amethyst" (Lat. amethystus from Greek &amp;0e&amp;ua'roo) has been a source of endless errors and misinterpretations in mediaeval and later lapidaries, a fact to which no attention has as yet been drawn.38 The second difficulty is the queer equipment of the uterus with (butter)flies' wings. Peiresc already observed that among about one hundred "gnostic" gems in his possession there are several on which one sees the uterus in just the same form and position as on the gem sent to Rubens (all also with the sort of design at the mouth of the uterus, which puzzled Rubens-viz. the key), "ma perb senza quelle ale di papilioni o di mosca le quali io non ho mai visto se non in questo intaglio solo che mi ricordi."39 From his comprehensive and unequalled knowledge of these gems Bonner comes to the conclusion that "the fact that the vessel [uterus] rests upon an altar and has wings attached to it marks it as a forgery, because not one of the many genuine uterine amulets has these characteristics. But it is also clear that the forger had used a genuine specimen as a pattern, modifying it according to his ignorant fancy."40 Bonner is most certainly right, when he adds, that "certain incredible designs on the plates of Chiflet and Capello show clearly enough that spurious gems were no rarity at that period."4' 3. The Winged Womb Still it might be worth while to examine furtner the two iconographical details which Bonner lists as marks of forgery-wings and altar. As regards the wings there exists, until lately unpublished, at least one other gem with a "winged" uterus. It is No. 48954 in the British Museum,42 here reproduced on P1. 26f, g. The obverse of this oblong haematite, 33 mm. high, 22 mm. wide, shows the familiar object; just as on Rubens' intaglio the key is incom- plete and two "wings" proceed upwards starting from the neck of the uterus. Above it we see the so-called Chnoubis-serpent43 with seven rays projecting from its head. In the field at the left there is the well-known name IA044 above a magic sign (eight-pointed asterisk), at the right a Z-shaped sign, and several other smaller and partly indistinct signs and stars. The reverse shows Anubis (or Seth?)45 standing to the left, holding in the right hand a sword (or short sceptre?), in the left an indistinct object which might be intended for the usual pail of Anubis or for some hieroglyphic sign, SA (= Protection) or ANKH (the crux ansata). This gem is of exceedingly poor workmanship, hastily and carelessly engraved, and the composition is rather unusual. But although I suspect it to be a late fabrication I do not feel entitled to assert that it is not antique.48 Apart from the "wings" of the uterus all the other elements are familiar from genuine specimens. The Chnoubis serpent (usually Notes 34 to 46, see pp. 21 5-21 6.</page><page sequence="6">t96 A. A. BARB combined with other protecting deities, among which Anubis is also frequent) occurs often in the centre above the uterus.47 The three magic characters are well known from "gnostic" gems.48 For the "wings," too, genuine antique evidence can be found, although so far not from other engraved gems. The idea of a "bicornuate" uterus -derived no doubt from anatomical observations on slaughtered animals while dissection of human bodies was still shunned49-was prevalent in ancient medicine and far into the Middle Ages.W Now a large number of terra-cotta votive offerings are extant, mainly from Italian sites and re- publican times, on which the uterus is represented.,s On account of their size and material these monuments allow a more realistic representation than the intaglios, and here we often find (cf. P1. 25f, g) the uterus-shaped object connected with a roughly similar, but smaller and slenderer organ. The fact that this appendix is sometimes shown at the left, sometimes at the right side of the larger organ suggests that these terra-cottas represent not a frontal but a profile view of the uterus with its two "horns"52 while the British Museum intaglio tries a frontal representation of the same conception.53 There was evidently a marked uncertainty about the exact form of the ligaments and supplementary organs of the human uterus54 and the simplified form as shown in our P1. 25a is, if the most frequent, by no means the only one to be found on gems.55 It is therefore quite possible that there were several gems of a type like our British Museum specimen, and that one of them had served as pattern to the Renaissance forger who had cut the gem which Peiresc presented to Rubens. Whoever the "forger" was-and I wonder whether this expression is adequate for somebody who might have intended to produce a powerful amulet in accordance with tradition and the monuments of the ancients"5-I think we should moderate Bonner's rather harsh judgment about the forger's "ignorant fancy." Not only had he probably an unsuspect monu- ment with a "winged" uterus as pattern and saw nothing queer in that, as winged phalli are commonplace among antique monuments; there was also, as we shall see later, an ancient tradition of a "divine uterus," which he might have thought adequately expressed by placing the winged uterus on an "altar" or rather a pedestal, just like any other divine statue. The Frenchman Louis Chaduc (1564-1638), conseiller au prisidial in Riom and collector of this particular kind of engraved amulet stone,57 was certainly neither directly nor indirectly concerned with the forgery of the Peiresc- Rubens gem; Kohler's suggestion in this direction was the result of a mis- understanding which Bonner removes for good.58 Nevertheless this man and his curious collection59 might contribute to the understanding of the Peiresc-Rubens intaglio. Peiresc informed Rubens that he had shown his gem to Chaduc who got quite excited about the uterus-representation, as he found in it at last the long-looked-for certain proof for his pet idea, viz. that the ancients used the snail as a symbol for the female sex organ.60 This idea is discussed at some unsavoury lengths by Rubens in his reply,e1 although it does not become clearer from either his or Peiresc's letters why just the stone in question should prove Chaduc's strange theory. Now we know that Chaduc prepared as his magnum opus an illustrated catalogue of his collection. He did Notes 47 to 61, see pp. 216-218.</page><page sequence="7">DIVA MATRIX 197 not live to see it printed; his collection was dispersed and most of the illus- trations had been removed by later hands from the catalogue manuscript when the seventeenth-century antiquarian Baudelot de Dairval saw it half a century after Chaduc's death. Coincidentally, however, one of the few remain- ing illustrations which he found and reproduced in his book De l'utilitl des voyages" supplies, I think, the pertinent information missing in Peiresc's and Rubens' letters. The obverse of this intaglio of Chaduc showed an obscene standing male figure with the legend DIV(us) PRIAP(us) CONSER(vator) C(aius) SILIV(s) while the reverse (here reproduced P1. 26a) shows an altar or pedestal of exactly the same kind as on the Rubens sketch, but on it the uterus is replaced by a snail, over which is engraved the familiar (but not antique) sign for Venus +o 63 between two asterisks. The corrupt legend FELX MES VENVSTV SILVXO obviously is (or was originally) meant to allude to the adulterous "marriage" of the lewd Messalina, wife of the emperor Claudius, with C. Silius (identified on the obverse with the god Priapus) and must be read FEL(i)X MES(salina) VENUS(?) TU(?) SIL(ii) UXO(r), or similarly. It belongs to a group of (Renaissance?) forgeries" gloating over the scandalous story.65 Whether Chaduc was aware of this allusion or not, a comparison of this stone with Peiresc's description of the gem he gave to Rubens well explains Chaduc's excitement. The OEOT A(HXou) OTHPOZ round the phallic emblem on the one obverse is the exact equivalent of the DIV(us) PRIAP(us) CONSER(vator)6" round the standing figure on the other obverse. The reverse showing an "altar" with a snail, accompanied by the name and sign of Venus should correspondingly be the equivalent of the other reverse where on the same kind of altar the well-known uterus- symbol is introduced as oEAE MHTP(oc;).67 One would be inclined to assume a fairly similar place and time for both these "forgeries". And one might wonder whether a type similar to our British Museum gem was not in a way the source for either of them; the "snail" on Chaduc's stone might actually be the misunderstood Chnoubis-serpent, enthroned separately on the one reverse, while the pedestal on the other reverse idolizes the "divine womb." 4. Gnostic Uterus Mythology Now what exactly was meant by a "Divine Womb"-as the object repro- duced on the gem in question is called in the engraver's legend and-without hesitation-by Peiresc and Rubens? We have seen so far that this stone was not quite so "stupid"68 a forgery as it may well seem at first. I also mentioned that the embarrassingly ubiquitous deification of the phallus in ancient monu- ments and literature might have fostered the idea of an equally divine uterus. There is, however, more substantial evidence for the antiquity of this con- ception. Bonner thought it unlikely6" "that Peiresc was influenced by a memory of Irenaeus (I, 28, 9 ed. Harvey), who says that the Cainite heretics called Hystera (Womb) the maker of heaven and earth."70 But the book by the bishop of Lyons (d. 202 A.D.) against the gnostic heresies, easily accessible in its Latin translation, was well known in Peiresc's times. The same applies to a similar work by Epiphanius of Salamis (d. 4o3 A.D.) who is more explicit Notes 62 to 70, see pp. 218-219.</page><page sequence="8">198 A. A. BARB on the subject. He writes in his "bread-basket of heresies," summarizing the teachings of certain followers of Nicolaos, that in the beginning, when there was only Darkness, Abyss, Water, and Spirit, Darkness embraced the Spirit and gave birth to a being called "Womb" (Mitra). Mitra herself, yearning after the Spirit, brought forth four Aeons, who in turn produced fourteen Aeons, and lastly an ugly, infamous Aeon. From the copulation of this last disgraceful Aeon with Mitra were born Gods, Angels, Demons and seven Spirits. x Since the middle of last century we also know the elaborate account about the cosmological "Womb" given by St. Irenaeus' pupil, St. Hippolytus of Rome. According to him it is the Sethian heresy which asserted72 that "from the first grand intercourse of the three original principles [archai]"-viz. light, darkness and spirit [pneuma]--"there originates some grand form of seal [sphragis], 3 Heaven and Earth. Now the shape of heaven and earth is'similar to a womb [mitra] with the navel in the middle; and if anybody wants to demonstrate visibly this shape, let him skilfully dissect the pregnant womb of any animal and he will find a model,of heaven and earth and of everything which lies in their midst unchangeable.74 This kind of womb-like shape of heaven and earth originated from the first intercourse ..." From the follow- ing exposition in the same chapter we understand, however, that the term "womb" (with attributes like "unclean" or "baneful") is applied more speci- fically by the Sethians to the principle of darkness. This principle, also described as the "awful water," the "floods underneath,"'"75 being in itself wholly negative and void, tries with all its might and intelligence to retain the positive principles of light and spirit against their will. Hippolytus' account of how this mythological struggle is combined with the figure of Christ in that particular brand of gnostic heresy does not concern us here, since Hippolytus tells us that the idea of the primeval "Womb" is not peculiar to the Sethians but borrowed from Orphic sources and mystery religions.78 This Uterus-mythology might be alluded to in a magic papyrus,77 where a dithyrambic prayer of thanksgiving twice addresses the (male) Godhead as "Womb" [mitra].78 We have seen that the primeval womb was identified with the dark waters of the abyss. These theological conceptions seem to con- form with what we know both about the teachings of the "Peratic" heresy and about the cosmological conceptions of the Chaldees (Babylonians). As regards the Peratae St. Hippolytus treats us to an extensive verbatim excerpt from one of their canonical books.79 In similarly exalted language as the magic prayer mentioned above we are told here that "the power derived from Chaos," "the power of the vault of the abyss," which is described as the primal force and as being a hermaphrodite, is called Thalassa (= The ea) 80so but that the ignorant who are not initiated identified it with Kronos,81 the shackled inmate of Tartaros.82 On the other hand Babylonic-Chaldean Cosmogony, as we hear from Berosos "the Chaldean" (d. ca. 290 B.C.),83 sets out with a female ruler named Omorka(?),"4 "which the Chaldeans call Thalatth, the Greeks translate it Thalassa (s. above!);85 this female (a few sentences later Berosos calls it Skotos [ = Darkness], a neuter in Greek!) was, so we are told, cut in two by Bel who shaped from its halves Earth and Notes 71 to 85, see pp. 219-220.</page><page sequence="9">27 ! i ii?!! :i b :": ?: _ --I_ -:;..-:i ~:---:- :"li I ir-- ?:-_-- i~-_~ ?i :- :: -;-.

It is quite obvious that this report of the Hellenistic writer still reflects Old Babylonian cosmology as deciphered from cuneiform writing only last century."8 We recognize Tiamat, the Goddess of the Abyss, whose body Marduk ( = Bel) "split like a shellfish'7 into two parts: Half of her he set up and ceiled it as sky .. ." According to Berosos, Bel (Marduk) was identi- fied with the Greek Zeus; if so it is easy to understand how the conquest of abysmal Darkness (figured as the primeval sexless womb) by victorious Light, personified as the battle of Bel against "Omorka," Marduk against Tiamat, was seen still further anthropomorphized in the struggle of Zeus against his father Kronos who was gelded, fettered and thrust into Tartaros.88 The Peratic teaching of Thalassa = Kronos appears consistent, even rational. 5. Symbols of the Ancient Near East and Greece As we have mentioned, St. Hippolytus clearly saw that the Uterus-Myth was not a creation of the Gnostics but borrowed from older mythology.89 Now qruite apart from any parallels one might or might not find in the goddess Tiamat of the Babylonian creation epos, there is certain archaeological evi- dence for an idea of a primeval "divine womb" even older than Orpheus and Greek mystery religions. The symbol of the Mesopotamian mother-goddess Nintu, the "Lady of birth," better known as Ninhursag, the "Lady of the Mountain,"90 one of the oldest Sumerian deities, appears to be a simplified representation of the womb.91 The sign consists of an arch with spirally curled ends on both sides, usually roughly similar to the Greek letter Omega [n] (see P1. 27a, b), but there are variations where the spirals are enlarged and the arch flattened (P1. 27c, f) or reduced to a kind of apex between the two spirals (P1. 27d, e). It is an odd coincidence (although certainly not more than that), that on Sumerian boundary stones we actually see this womb-symbol placed on an altar or throne-just as on Rubens' gnostic gem (see P1. 27d-h).92 H. Frank- fort has drawn our attention to the fact that this Sumerian sign of the womb turns up, only slightly modified, both in Ancient and Modern Egyptian symbolism.93 Another simplified figure of the human uterus, from the anatomical point of view reasonably correct, appears to have developed in Egyptian hieroglyphic writing into the sign SA,94 meaning "Protection,"gs perhaps also into the emblem of the Carthagenian mother-goddess Tanit96 and of the hieroglyph for "Life" (Ankh-crux ansata).97 This symbol, more- over, turned into a kind of human face, might be the origin of the (wigless) representations of the Egyptian mother-goddess Hathor (cf. P1. 29a, b).98 On the other hand, as regards the more familiar Hathor-head with the typical headdress (Pls. 28b, 29c-f) or wig-could it be a mere coincidence that the form of this headdress repeats exactly the uterus-symbol of the Babylonian goddess Ninhursag, discussed above (P1. 28c)? 99 In both forms, with and without "wig," the head-(uterus-)symbol appears in two (simul- taneously used) shapes of the ceremonial sistrum100 of Hathor (P1. 29b, c, e). We find both forms also on gold ornaments (I7th-I6th cent. B.c.) from Tell el Ajjul near Gaza in Palestine.'o' The two types of pendants (P1. 29g-i), Notes 86 to 1o0, see pp. 220-222.</page><page sequence="12">200 A. A. BARB the very outlines of which might suggest the shape of the human uterus, indicate by breasts, navel and vulva sketchily added to the Hathor-head a gradual development from the symbol to the anthropomorphic idol of a mother-goddess (Kadesh?).102 This change-over from symbols to icons was, as we know, not without exceptions and retardations. There are plenty of instances where the old aniconic divine symbol has been worshipped till late into Greek and Roman times, even into our times if (not to mention the copious anthropological evidence from primitive races) we include fetishes like the Kaaba in Mecca.103 In the context of this paper the various "navel"- stones (omphaloi) must here be mentioned,'04 the navel being a pars pro toto symbol of the "belly," i.e., the womb.'05 We must not be surprised if these omphaloi occur not only in the cult of mother-goddesses but also in that of male divinities: we are faced here with very old religious conceptions dating from times when the deity was still thought to be bisexual or, more correctly, asexual.'06 We have met these asexual or even male (Kronos-cf. above, p. 198) "wombs" preserved in gnostic tradition. Perhaps the best known omphalos was that in Delphi. Here the very names Delphoi, (Apollo) Delphinios, and especially that of Delphyne(s) (some kind of local Grecian Tiamat), stress the connexion of the omphalos with the uterus: Delphys is a Greek word for "womb"'107 and the viviparous "fish" dolphin (Greek: delphis) is, as is quite obvious in its representations with Venus,'08 a symbol of the uterus.109 In the shape of an omphalos (umbilicus) the Egyptians still venerated in Hellenistic times their god Amon at his desert oracle, best known from the history of Alexander the Great.x0o Actually we have several representations of an "aniconic" Amonx"' in a shape which reminded scholars describing it of a "wineskin" or "sack" (P1. 3oe-g). This "sack" might just as well be compared to the shape of the human stomach (cf. P1. 3oh)112 and may represent Amon as the primeval (asexual) womb, going back to a time when the conceptions of "stomach" and "womb" were practically identical."x3 On the other hand an object fairly similar to the "aniconic" Amon which occurs on certain Old Egyptian standards (P1. 3oa-d) has been explained as the (royal?) placenta"x4 and we remember that we have already met the placenta as the centre-piece of the macrocosmic womb in Gnostic specula- tion.115 6. The Isis-Emblem in the "Golden Ass" However that may be, we possess what I think to be a fairly clear descrip- tion of a uterus-image as symbol"6 of the great mother-goddess Isis, who had absorbed more or less all the older Egyptian mother-goddesses in Graeco- Roman times. This description is to be found in a passage of the "Golden Ass" of Apuleius, which has apparently so far not been fully explained."' In his vivid report on the solemn festival of Isis, Apuleius tells us how, after various groups of popular and ecclesiastic pageantry, the Gods themselves appear marching in the solemn procession. First comes the dog-headed Anubis,x8e then the effigy of a cow standing erect on the shoulders of one of the ministers, another of them carries the cista mystica with its hidden contents.

It was not shaped like cattle (pecus), bird (avis), or wild beast (fera), nor even like a human being (homo),119 but a clever invention of awe-inspiring novelty, the unutterable demonstration (argumentum inefabile) of a religion which was both sublimer in every way and to be covered in deep silence.'20 In this manner was it fashioned from glittering gold. A small vessel (urnula) most skilfully hollowed out, with well-rounded bottom (fundus),'21 the outer surface covered with wonderful Egyptian imagery.122 Its mouth (orificium),'23 slightly raised (rimmed?), jutted out in an extended channel (canalem124 por- rectum) with long neck (? "rivulo").125 On the other side was fastened a handle, far receding in wide extension. Upon this handle sat a viper, twisted into a knot and with the wrinkled swelling of its scaly head erect."126 This description not only uses the words we find in anatomical descriptions for parts of the uterus, but also fits well with the magical and anatomical pictures with which we had to deal (see Pls. 25, 26, 31, 33). That an image of the uterus was really carried about or at least shown held in the hand of a divine figure is testified by an interesting haematite intaglio in the Cabinet des Midailles in Paris.127 Here a ram-headed god (Ammon? Chnum?), seated between Isis (standing behind him) and Harpokrates (rising from the head of a Bes-figurel28 in front of him) holds on his raised right hand the familiar mitra-symbol, complete with appendices and key (P1. 33d).129 As regards the long-drawn-out neck (channel) in Apuleius' description we can point to a haematite gem in Athens, described by Delatte.xso Above (or below?) the uterus-image with very long channel (P1. 33g) one sees a sign which Delatte describes as "un crochet," but which very much resembles the Egyptian hiero- glyph for "ruler," "regent."131 The reverse has not the usual legend Ororiouth (about which more anon) but the word Marmarotokombai. This word appears ("Mormorotokonbai") in connexion with other epithets and formulae in two magical papyri,132 but also on at least three other magic gems.s33 Delatte saw in the first part of this word (Marmarot) the divine epithet, written more often Marmaraoth or similarly.x34 We can add to this that Komba (Kymbe, Kumba) is, according to Eisler,x35 the root meaning "womb" from which the names of Kybele and other ancient mother-goddesses are derived. So it almost seems that image and legend of this Athenian gem actually unite to proclaim some conception of a "Diva Matrix," a conception in quest of which we started from Rubens' "faked" intaglio and which we found in the "cosmic" womb of the gnostics. There is another representation on some of these uterus-amulets which Delatte was inclined to interpret as "la matrice de l'univers."'36 It only occurs on the reverse of gems the obverse of which shows either the familiar mitra-image or a naked woman, squatting in the position of parturition.x37 Bonner reproduces four specimens'38 with this "octopus type" (as he calls it) of the "uterine symbol."'39 Now the "octopus type" (cf. our P1. 3Ig) consists of a round or ovoid ball (globe) "from the bottom of which several wavy lines extend"140 and is usually surmounted by the scarabaeus (which sometimes has added the head of a hawk). But the scarab (as well as the hawk) are solar emblems par excellence. There is also a definite similarity between the "octopus type" and the Egyptian hieroglyph Notes 119 to 14o, see pp. 224-226. 3</page><page sequence="14">202 A. A. BARB for "light," "sunshine."'41 All this indicates that the "octopus type" does not represent the uterus but is a solar symbol, expressing "light."142 Further- more, the most likely interpretation put forward so far for the word Ororiouth (a word to be found, as mentioned already, on the reverse of most intaglios with the uterus symbol on the obverse) is "Light of Lights."143 True, as Delatte has shown, on one of these uterine, amulets Ororiouth is expressly stated to be (one of) the name(s) of the "Lord" (kyrios) "of the womb of the women,"144 but this does not interpret the etymological meaning of the word itself. If this really means the primeval, celestial "Light" and at the same time denominates the "Lord of the womb" one is forcibly reminded of those gnostic speculations (see above, p. 198) where the principle of "Light" is set in con- trast against the Womb of the Abyss, the principle of "Darkness" and where out of this "Darkness" (the primeval Chaos) the world is produced by the principles of "Light" and "Spirit."145 Though being aware of the "madness" of these gnostic and magic speculations and amulets, one feels inclined to admit that "there is method in it," when one finds one side of all these amulets devoted to the female principle of the womb (mitra image, squatting parturient woman,146 winged uterus idol on Rubens' 147 and snail with Venus-symbol on Chaduc's's4 gem) while the other side presents the male principle (the "primeval light" in symbols or name [Ororiouth], Anubis,149 Heracles,160 the phallos on Rubens' and Priapus on Chaduc's gem).151 7. More Gnostic Speculation Is then the Mitra image on all these uterine amulets (however humdrum may have been their actual destination for everyday gynaecological ailments and prolific human childbirth) primarily and originally designed to portray the "Diva Matrix," the cosmic womb, the last and deepest secret of existences62 just like the Isis symbol in Apuleius' "Golden Ass"? That might fit quite well with the "ouroboros,"153 the serpent devouring its own tail, symbol of eternity (the cycle of the sun), which on most of these amulets surrounds the uterus image. On a specimen in the British Museum the body of the mitra bears the inscription IAO !54 And when in a magical papyruss55 the all- powerful Deity speaks (through the mouth of the exorcist): "My name is a Heart (Womb?158) surrounded by a serpent"-have we to see here the by now familiar representation (Pls. 25a, 31 d, f, h) ? The answer to such questions will probably always be a matter of highly personal disposition. I for one should be reluctant to discard completely the term "gnostic gems," as Campbell Bonner does with rather austere scepticism,153 although I readily admit that antiquarianism of three centuries, from L'Heureux and Chiflet up to Matters, C. W. King and Wallis Budge blundered so often in stating the "gnostic" case as to discredit this terminology.s58 We have mentioned (above, p. 197) Bonner's doubts about Peiresc rertem- bering St. Irenaeus' writings on the Gnostics when he described the gem with the "deified womb." It is certainly more than unlikely that Rubens was sufficiently familiar with the works of Irenaeus or Epiphanius to know from them about these gnostic conceptions; and nobody in the seventeenth century Notes 114 to 158, see pp. 226-228.</page><page sequence="15">DIVA MATRIX 203 could possibly have known about the account given by St. Hippolytus, or about the Babylonian, Egyptian or other ancient evidence for a symbolic uterus which I have tried to assemble in these pages. Still there were "forgers"159 who invented and antiquaries who readily recognized representa- tions of the "diva matrix." What were their sources? But what, one must also ask, were the sources from which in the sixteenth century Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, called Paracelsus, the influence of whose teach- ings was widespread in Rubens' days, distilled his theosophic-astrological bombast about the microcosmic and macrocosmic matrix?1e0 Now Paracelsus, whether the "great" reformer of medical art or the "arch-humbug" and "donkeys' darling," as Francis Bacon called him,ls1 talks a great deal about "how the Creator has formed heaven and earth to a womb (matrix)" in which Adam was conceived,162 and that just as man lives in this womb of the outer world so the (unborn) child lives under the firmament of the mother's womb. The same elements, planetary influences and "impressions," thunderstorms and earthquakes rule the life in the cosmic and in the human womb. "So the [female] womb is the smaller world and comprises every thing of heaven and earth."16s On the other hand, "before heaven and earth were created the spirit of God was moving upon the water. This water was the womb (matrix) ; then in this water were created heaven and earth and in no other womb. ... ."4Q The similarity of these ideas with those quoted above, page 198, from St. Hippolytus' writings is striking. But, as we noted before, this part of Hip- polytus' works was discovered only in the nineteenth century and was there- fore not available in the libraries of the sixteenth century-if indeed Paracelsus had any use for libraries. There were of course Manicheism, Arabic Alchemy and Jewish Kabbala which kept much of the ancient gnostic ideas alive through the Middle Ages. But I think the fascination of possible "sources" which made the historic research of the last hundred years develop the "Quellenkritik" into a kind of art for art's sake tends to blind us to a more natural, organic approach to such questions. L. Thorndike once mentioned (in connexion with a particular, but similar subject) the importance for "all ancient and mediaeval accounts" of what he calls the "consensus of opinion and common learned tradition ... which is more significant than the possible borrowings of individual authors from one another."16r A century ago the German poet and orientalist Friedrich Riickert saw the problem in a more romantic mood. "Ideas arise from mouldy library vaults," he writes, "and others are dissolved in the air like the fragrance of flowers. Nothing that was ever thought of is lost for the thinking and no new thought is born which was not preconceived before ...; if an idea has dawned upon you, even if you do not impart it to anybody, it is not lost for the world." He scorns the argu- ments about priority for particular ideas: "the 'Spirit of Man' has joined forces to think it out."1e6 Modern Tiefenpsychologie has substituted for this "Spirit of Mankind" the "processes in the collective unconscious" and the archetypal mythologem of the "Womb" has not failed to attract the attention of the fashionable psychologists. Unquestionably this symbol crops up with the typical "ambivalence" of the "archetype" at very different places and times, as we have already seen and as it could be demonstrated with many more Notes 159 to 166, see p. 228.</page><page sequence="16">204 A. A. BARB examples: Milton speaks of infernal Chaos as "the womb of nature and perhaps her grave."1'' The "womb" of the "Old Woman" is for Australian aborigines not only the source of all life but also, represented as a trench or as a sacred festival ground, the place of rebirth and physical and spiritual regenera- tion ;xes and similarly the dolmens erected by the inhabitants of Vao (New Hebrides) over tombs are supposed to represent the womb (of re-birth).1xe Roman Catholic liturgy speaks of spiritual rebirth from "the immaculate womb of the divine font"o-70-while the jaws of Leviathan, that older and less charming brother of the Greek "womb-fish" the dolphin (see above, p. 200) represent the gulf of the hellish abyss. 8. Snail, Conch, Cockle, and Shell But revenons a nos moutons; let us return to the Peiresc-Rubens gem and to that of Monsieur Chaduc. We have tried to explain (see above, p. 197) why Chaduc might have found in the comparison of the two gems in question a new confirmation of his theory that the ancients used the snail as a symbol for the womb. Was his theory right, even if the two gems were fakes? In Chaduc's timesv17 as to-day the snail was known as a symbol of slowness, and the same holds good for classical antiquity.172 There is little evidence for the snail ever having signified the womb. If Soranus in his Gynaecology173 describes the shape of the (animal-) womb (in contrast to the human womb!) as "helix-shaped" (&amp;axommu) that does not mean that he thought of a helix= snail; he probably simply meant "spiral-shaped." Plautus using the word concha for the female sex organ has in mind, as is obvious from the context, a shell-fish or mussel (Greek x6yvx)174 not a snail-shell, although concha (like cochlea and the Greek x6xxo~) is used for either. Looking for archaeological evidence one finds the terra-cotta lamp in Berlin, published by Jahn,175 which shows opposite a phallos a snail and opposite a scorpion a toad, clearly meant as two pairs of symbols for the male and female pudenda.17e Jahn also refers to an engraved stone with phallos and snail (and butterfly).177 Similar stones in St. Petersburg178 and in an Austrian private collectionL79 are mentioned in archaeological literature. The genuineness of all these monuments is open to doubts, especially as regards the stones.s18 There is an obviously similar gem published and reproduced by Furtwanglert18 on which a winged phallos seems about to enter a helix. This helix however is definitely a sea-shell, not a snail. Altogether Chaduc's theory would be better founded had he meant "snails" in a wider sense, comprising shell-fish, cockles and conchs-the sexual symbolism of which is well documented. It seems tempting to assume that the idea of the snail as womb-symbol originated from some learned misunderstanding, when "cochlea" or "concha" in its symbolic connexion was translated as "snail" without regard to the bulk of philological as well as archaeological evidence pointing to sea-shells.1s8 Apparently the most ubiquitous symbol of the female pudenda is the cowry shell (and the shells of similar gastropods of the genus Cyprea), the amuletic use of which is well known.'xs8 Their symbolism seems to be derived from a similarity of the underside of these shells to the vulva.1s4 To this their Notes 167 to 184, see pp. 228-229.</page><page sequence="17">DIVA MATRIX 205 iconographic significance the fact has to be added, that-as has been rightly observed-"their origin from the fertilizing waters causes them to be regarded as life-giving and so promoting fertility."'x85 The similarity of some Cypreae to an egg, noted already by the ancients,1se may have pointed in the same direction. Less widely diffused perhaps, in time and space, than the cowry symbol is the symbolism of the bivalves. However, the genera Cardium and particularly Pecten, showing a more clearly defined and ornamental shape than the Cyprea genus, grew to be the favourite "shell" symbols in Graeco-Roman and later art.187 Moreover, the Greek word for the scallop-shell, Kteis, meaning (like the Latin Pecten) the comb and consequently used for various other objects with projecting teeth,'88 was also used for the female pudenda.189 We find the scallop-shell as emblem frequently connected with Venus, even more frequently than the dolphin of similar significance.190 Egyptian terra-cottas of Graeco-Roman times revealingly show Venus holding the shell in the proper (or rather improper) position (P1. 28e),'9' just as the Egyptian childbirth-goddess Taurt holds the SA-symbol on Pl. 28d, and I think it might be pertinent to refer here to the archaic Greek vase-painting of a mother- goddess (P1. 28f)192 where the fish-symbol (although not just a dolphin)193 appears in the same place (see also Addenda, p. 238). 9. The Birth of Venus: Rebirth and After-Life Generally familiar, not least from Botticelli's masterpiece, 94 is the appear- ance of the shell in connexion with the "Birth of Venus" from the sea. The representation of Aphrodite, the "foam-born" goddess, lyirig, kneeling, squat- ting or sitting in a sea-shell, usually of the pecten type, became so commonplace in Greek and Roman art195 that the original meaning seems almost forgotten. One did not necessarily think any more of a birth'96 from the shell but con- sidered the latter just as a fanciful but appropriate vehicle'97 on which the sea- born goddess was riding triumphantly on the waves, being taken to the shores. But there can be no doubt that the original idea was the birth from the shell and that the sea-shell as symbol of the vulva was particularly fitted to repre- sent the uterus of the Sea,198 that primeval mitra which we have met in the cosmogonical systems of the Gnostics.199 Mythology, since Hesiod at least, told the story of the genitals of Uranos, amputated by Kronos (the story is repeated later as Kronos being castrated by Zeus) and thrown into the sea from whose foam arose Aphrodite Anadyo- mene.200 But, as some Gnostics taught, Kronos himself is the primeval sea, the abyss, and we really seem here confronted with a confusion which was recently described as an "ontogeny" where "begetting and birth are identical, as also the begetter and the begotten."'20 On the other hand there was the story of the wind (or spirit) raising and impregnating the first generating life-force from the sea (or abyss)202 and one could ask whether some blurred remembrance of this mythologem does not linger in the Homeric hymn on Aphrodite. Nothing is mentioned in this poem of the dismal castration of Kronos; we are only told of Zephyros, the wind-god, bringing the goddess on a sea-wave to Notes 185 to 202, see pp. 229-230.</page><page sequence="18">206 A. A. BARB the shores of Kypros. Botticelli's picture still preserves this, as I am inclined to think, secondary function of the wind-god, while the primary story might be reflected in the mythos of Boreas and Oreithyia. Like so many mythological themes the representation of the Birth of Venus appears on sepulchral monuments, obviously with an esoteric twist203 which alluded to rebirth and eternal life. That Venus in this connexion is less important than the shell can be concluded from the innumerable sarcophagi and tombstones where not Venus but the head or bust of the deceased appear inside the shell.204 It seems to me a mistake to explain this motif from the architectural use of the shell ornament (about which more anon). Shells have been found in tombs so frequently and curiously,205 are so conspicuously used as ornament on leaden coffins in Roman times, are so clearly connected with the idea of resurrection in all parts of the world from America to China206 that there can be no question of mere ornamentation.207 The explanation seems natural enough. We remember the story in the Evangelium when Jesus spoke to Nicodemus of rebirth.208 Automatically, almost as a matter of course, Nicodemus replies: "How can a man return into the womb of his mother?" Rebirth like birth requires the uterus and we are actually bound to expect some symbol of the womb where belief in rebirth and after-life of any kind is present. There is, of course, first and foremost the womb of "Mother Earth." "For the body is restored to Earth, placed and laid out as if enveloped by the mother's covering," says Cicero,209 referring to the old custom of inhumation before cremation became usual. Similar conceptions can be traced in pre- historic (and later) burial rites of various types. There are those very common inhumations of bodies in a crouched or contracted position with knees drawn up, a position that has often been compared to that of an embryo in the womb.210 We occasionally find these, as it were, Embryos of After-life carefully deposited in large clay vessels which could well represent the uterus.211 When cremation became general the ashes still are usually deposited in (ossuary) urns which, at various times and places, take human form, mainly, and probably originally, female, obviously representing the "Great Mother."212 Suggestions which are occasionally ventilated213 that the grave-chamber (especially those with dome-shaped vaults), tumulus or barrow, some omphalos-shaped tomb- stones, etc., reflect uterus-symbolism certainly deserve further investigation, for which, however, there is no room here. The chthonian conception of rebirth from "Mother Earth" was gradually replaced in the upper and middle classes of later antiquity, under philosophical and theosophical influence (mystery religions), by a marine conception, a kind of funerary "Neptunism" as opposed to the older "Plutonism."214 If one had to return to the Womb to reach the sources215 of life eternal, why should one stop at Mother Earth, who herself was created from the first abyss, the primeval ocean. For from Okeanos, as Homer already knew, have originated all things and even the gods.216 To represent this "Womb of the Sea" one could choose the "womb-fish" dol- phin217-and Roman sepulchral art has freely used this symbol. More con- venient still-it would have been awkward to represent the deceased person inside a dolphin A la Jonah-was the shell symbol. That, I suggest, is the reason why we see the heads or busts of Roman ladies and gentlemen, re- Notes 203 to 217, see pp. 230-232.</page><page sequence="19">DIVA MATRIX 207 born with decency and decorum inside a shell,218 looking down on posterity from their well-earned heaven (a wreath sometimes surrounding the shell "crowns"219 their meritorious achievements; see P1. 32a). I0. Heaven and the Spiral It may be possible to find from these tombstone shells a connexion with the shell ornament representing the "heaven" above apses and recesses in architecture, so typical in Hellenistic, Roman and Christian art.220 One might argue that ornamentation of the tombstones, easily the largest group of "monuments," had its repercussions on monumental ornamentation generally, when the original meaning of this ornament was more or less forgotten. But the symbolism of the shell representing the sky221 seems rather derived from far older, more elementary and primitive conceptions than from sepulchral symbolism. If we remember the shell as symbol of the primeval matrix we are reminded of those mythologems where exactly this original Mitra repre- sents "Heaven and Earth."222 Was it not this very womb (in its dark aspect as Tiamat, the Abyss) which Marduk "split like a shellfish," transforming the upper part into the sky?223 Curiously enough there is a Micronesian creation myth telling the story of a bivalve conch (tridacna) and of a "snail"224 succeed- ing in separating the two valves which became heaven and earth; the snail, fixed to the sky, became the moon, another snail the sun.225 Monsieur Chaduc (see above, p. 196), no doubt, would have been delighted to hear about this cosmogonic snail, and the parallelism between the Babylonian and the Micro- nesian myth suggests investigating once more (see above, p. 204) whether our elusive snail-matrix is not after all a very old conception. Perhaps the cosmo- gonic helix-snail on the Micronesian firmament is just a variation of the snake coiled up spirally in the centre of the Babylonian sky as represented, for example, on our P1. 27g. In the same central (or better polar) position the Greeks saw in the sky Helike (called in one document also drakin helikoeidis- "the spiral-shaped serpent,") 226 a constellation connected with the two "Bears" (Ursa maior and U. minor).227 But "Helike" (in mythology one of the manifesta- tions of the universal mother-goddess) could just as well mean "the Snail,"228 and, incidentally, the adjective helikoeidis we have registered above as used in describing the uterus.229 On the other hand, as in cosmogonic myths the egg turns up far more frequently than the conch-its shell also being halved into heaven and earth230-we might compare conch, or snail, and their shells to the serpent and its egg(-shell).231 "Orphic" mythology tells the story of the Serpent Herakles (i.e. Kronos-Chronos-Aian),232 who created a vast egg which, filled with the force of its creator, burst in two; its upper shell formed heaven, the lower part earth.233 This mythologem is reflected in the famous Phanes relief of Modena.234 But the cosmic egg, this time still unbroken and entwined by the serpent, also adorns the "omphalos"235 of a curious late antique alabaster bowl which appears to have served in some eucharistic ritual of an "orphic" (or rather gnostic?) sect.236 Here (see P1. 32d) the parallel with the Babylonian and Greek polar serpent is evident (cf. P1. 27g), while at the same Notes 218 to 236, see pp. 232-233.</page><page sequence="20">20o8 A. A. BARB time the clumsy serpent is not so very unlike the snail as represented on Chaduc's gem (our P1. 26a).237 If we look for a common denominator for Serpent, Snail (Helix) and "stromboid"238 (univalve) Conch we are led to the Spiral as abstract form, 239 oddly enough that very shape which we have found as a basic element in Babylonian (and certain Egyptian) womb symbols.240 Other scholars have already interpreted the spiral "as symbol of life-giving," or "as a form of the Great Mother'"24 in early Aegaean or Mycenaean decorative art, where it occurs so very conspicuously in sacred and particularly sepulchral ornamentation. 242 One might even suspect the coiled serpent, the snail, and the stromboid conch to be a kind of "theriomorphization" (preceding the later religious development of "anthropomorphization" = the Mother-god- dess) of the life-giving symbol of the Spiral. But if we do so it still remains an open question243 whether this symbol was taken originally from the "bicor- nuate uterus of an heifer,"244 from the sex appeal of the hair-curls (of Hathor) 24 or the waves of the sea (Okeanos),246 from the Octopus247 or Nautilus,248 from the horns of the god Ammon249 or from the lotus-flower,250 from the spiral incurvation of the embryo or the tendrils (scroll) of germinating plants,25x from reed-bundles emerging on the roof of primeval sacred buildings,252 from the holy palm-tree (phoenix dactylifera),253 or-to leave earthly things altogether- from the "spiral twist" of the planetary orbits mentioned already by Plato.254 It may be that some enterprising adept of "Tiefenpsychologie," not content with tracing the collective unconscious (see above, p. 203) back to the embryo in the womb or even (as already has been suggested) to the egg,255 will boldly proceed in his quest to the spiral nebulae preceding our solar system.256 I do not propose to expatiate further here on the Platonic idea, as it were, or the archetype of the Spiral and/or the Womb. That can be left to those modern scholars who have thoroughly cast off the old-fashioned antiquarian chrysalis to stretch their wings in lofty flight. I shall be glad, however, if they can use for their mosaics the little stones collected here from out-of-the-way footpaths and, to a large extent, from just "those wretched subjects" from which this paper started and which guided us to conceptions of rebirth and heaven. Ex p a r t e enim cognoscimus et ex p a r t e prophetamus," to use the words of St. Paul (I Cor. xiii. 9). Was it not a similar feeling which A. Warburg expressed in his often quoted adage: "Der liebe Gott steckt im D e t a i "? APPENDIX: THE GORGON'S HEAD Usually one connects the Gorgon's Head (Medusa) with the vague con- ception of an "apotropaic symbol" and with the classic story about Perseus, as retold, for instance, "from the immortal storehouse of Greek mythology" with so much typically Victorian gusto by J. G. Frazer.257 But all experts agree to-day that this, as it were "orthodox," story has replaced older, more original conceptions258 and that the "mortal" Medusa is not only older than her two immortal Gorgonic sisters but also older than her comparatively late appearance in Greek art and literature. However, even separated from the Notes 237 to 258, see pp. 233-235.</page><page sequence="21">DIVA MATRIX 209 Perseus legend, the current interpretations of the fearful Gorgon's Head itself as "thunder cloud,"259 as the "black moon" (Schwarzmond)260 or as the "night sun" (Nachtsonne)261 somehow no longer convince, being too obviously born from a bygone fashion of nature-mythology. In our times a powerful new fashion has produced a new interpretation. Thirty years ago (1923) the psychoanalyst S. Ferenczi explained the Medusa as a symbol of the female genitals. The argumentation in his very short note262 on the subject may appear to non-psychoanalist readers (it did so to me, at least) as a witty persiflage of psychoanalistic dialectics. But it is meant to be in real earnest. About the same time (1922) Sigmund Freud him- self wrote on the subject, using roughly the same arguments as Ferenczi. Freud's paper was not published before 1940.263 He probably felt less certain about the merits of this theory than Ferenczi, as the last sentence of his note seems to disclose.264 Nevertheless, the Ferenczi-Freudian theory appears to have been incorporated meanwhile into psychoanalytical dogmatics.265 Under such circumstances it is interesting to find that there actually are certain archaeological clues suggesting an interpretation of the Medusa as a symbol not indeed of the (outer) female genitals, but for that "architypal" idea of the Primeval Womb (Diva Matrix) which I tried to sketch in the preceding pages.266 The Gorgon's Head may represent first and foremost the negative, evil aspects of the cosmogonic MAtra (see above, p. 198) although traits of the positive role are not wanting. One theory, widely accepted for some time, derived the Greek Medusa mask from the Egyptian or Phoenician representations of the god Bes267 whom we mentioned above as a Childbirth- or Womb-deity.268 The almost complete later abandoning of this theory by leading archaeologists269 was, I think, rather ill-considered. Another well-documented theory derives it from the Hathor head270 and we can now point to the fact that this emblem too appears to represent the womb.27' Both these theories were recently disparaged in favour of a third, a derivation of the Perseus-Medusa myth from Assyrian elements.272 Perseus, it is suggested, replaces the hero Gilgamesh, Medusa is the demon Humbaba, and the Gorgon's head is thought to have been fashioned by Greek artists after that queer head of the Humbaba demon with its single line draw- ing, resembling "sheep-entrails" (but also, one may note, containing the spiral or labyrinth element mentioned above)."27 It can be argued that all these three derivations are aspects of the same "archetype." If a roundish object like the womb-or, originally, rather the "belly"274- is personified and, consequently demands anthropomorphic (or at least theriomorphic) representation, fundamentally two possibilities are given for such images: (a) to take the object as a huge head to which rudimentary limbs may or may not be attached; (b) to take it as a body without head which must, however, have some kind of face to express personality, and possibly also some suggestion of limbs. One can see these two methods in the figure of Humpty-Dumpty in nursery books275 or in the personifications of modern commercial advertisements. Now (a) corresponds to the Hathor head, especially in its simplest form without "headdress" (P1. 29a, b, g, i) and might just as well be the Humbaba-head;276 (b) is Bes, the "stethokephalic" Notes 259 to 276, see pp. 235-238.</page><page sequence="22">210o A. A. BARB (showing a face on his breast) "Akephalos" (headless [god]).277 Logically the personified womb as such is originally sexless (or, what amounts to the same, bi-sexual)278 and male or female deities (or demons) are the product of further individualization. So we can find among the earliest Greek Medusa heads some bearded, male ones; on the other hand we have a female edition of Bes,279 and we remember that the "awful womb," the (female) "Abyss" is also identified with the (male) god Kronos.2s80 The existence of a bodyless head (as such the Medusa appears, for instance, in Homer) or a headless body (Akephalos-Bes) demands in turn, when simple vision is superseded by more or less logical reasoning, a "mythological" explanation. Thus Perseus beheads the pregnant woman Medusa, just as Gilgamesh slays Humbaba and we might perhaps see behind Humbaba the god Kingu whom Marduk beheaded to form mankind from his blood.28s The Hathor head, I think, could similarly be made responsible for the startling and illogical mythos of Horus beheading his mother Isis (viz. = Hathor)."22 In some, at least, of these myths the beheading is clearly a creative act,283 new life springs forth from the blood of the severed head, and it should not be overlooked that an old belief, very much alive in Greek medicine, contended that the head was the source of procreation and that human semen was pro- duced by secretion from the brain.284 Popular belief in the fecundating power of the blood from the head of the decapitated still led to revolting practices in nineteenth-century Egypt.2s5 The ambivalent character of the Matrix- archetype can be seen reflected in the story of the two drops of Medusa's blood which Athene gave to Erichthonios. One of the blood-drops is all- healing and life-giving, the other poisonous and killing.286 The close relationship, if not identity, of the primeval womb with the "Abyss" = the Sea287 tallies with the fact that Medusa's parents are reported to have been sea-gods, that she is made pregnant by Poseidon himself-in this and other respects blending with the sea-monster Skylla288-that in modern Greek folk-lore the Gorgons are identified with the Nereids.289 Actually the Gorgon's Head appears on sarcophagi flanked by sea-monsters just like the shell with the deceased290 in which we saw a symbol for rebirth from the primeval womb. The frequent appearance of the Medusa on Roman and Etruscan sepulchral monuments291 has been explained by the cheap clich6 of the "apotropaic symbol" although it would be awkward to explain just who should be protected against whom by the apotropaion on the tomb-stone. It is usually the living who need protection against spirits of the dead, not vice versa. If, on the contrary, we take the Gorgon's head as a womb-symbol promising re-birth it fits well with all the other emblems similarly used on other monuments of the same groups292 which, far from being frightening, generally hold out the same promise of a new life eternal: amphora,293 banquet,294 omphalos-bowl,295 flower,296 peltae amazonarum,297 rider on hippo- camp,298 bucranium, etc.299 Let us return from this blissful aspect of the Medusa, which might well account for the "beautiful" variety of the Gorgoneion masks on many monu- ments, to her demoniacal gloom. A certain type of Byzantine amulet300 addresses the "Womb" (hystera), the "dark and black one,"301 who "coils Notes 277 to 301, see pp. 236-237.</page><page sequence="23">DIVA MATRIX 21I like a serpent,"302 "hisses like a snake," "roars303 like a lion" to settle down "like a lamb." It is obvious that here the animal-like, "roaming" uterus is being exorcised, a conception which we have met before (see note 23). These amulets now show the Gorgon's head surrounded by fearful serpents, not, I think, to frighten the "Hystera" away304 but as illustration, as her por- trait. Just as knowledge of his or her real name gives the exorcist power over the demon, so does possession of the image. The idea is the same in both cases: I know you-therefore you cannot evade or deceive me. There is another testimony telling us that in late antique thought the female arch-demon, the primeval dark Abyss, took the shape of the Gorgon's Head. In the so-called "Testament of Solomon''305 we read of the Abyzouth.306 She appears as a female head without visible body (her body was "darkness" [skotos]307) and with dishevelled hair.308 Solomon has her hung up in front of the temple, fettered with her own hair and for all to see. It is clear that the writer had in mind some Gorgoneion. A remarkable picture of the Medusa, as alive in late antique folk-lore, is drawn by the so-called Physiologus, that queer compiler of popular natural history and Christian moral theology. For him the Gorgon (Gorgoni) is just one more kind of strange animal, like the Lion, the Unicorn, or the Siren.309 She "appears like a beautiful harlot,310 the hair of her head is like gold (serpents?),311 but the look of her face (means) death." At the time of her rut "she roars like a lion"312 and imitates the sounds of other animals,313 human beings, cattle, bird, or serpent, inviting to carnal lust; and all who come and see her die instantly. But the crafty "magician" knows how to deceive her and he succeeds in decapitating her without looking at her head. This head he uses as a powerful weapon to petrify his adversaries, "as also King Alexander held it, to be lord of all the nations. Thus thou too, O man endowed with reason, shalt in peace be lord over all the hostile powers, if thou art united in mind with God." I think that testimonies of this kind (Hystera-amulets, Testamentum Salo- monis, Physiologus), usually brushed aside as hybrid "syncretism," may well represent original, archaic conceptions preserved in popular tradition, while the more conventional mythology, produced by "classical" poets and artists, may turn out to be artificial and misleading.314 From this point of view Arabic astrological lore could possibly also contribute to an interpretation of the Medusa. In the constellation of Perseus, where Greek astronomers saw the Gorgon's head, Arabic astronomers list the "[Head of] the Ghoul," [Caput] Algol as it is transcribed in Latin works. The Arabic "Ghoul" is the same word as the Greek GyllJ, well known from late Greek charms as the principal name of the female arch-demon which we met in the Testamentum Salomonis as Abyzouth-Abyssos.315 The Greek as well as the Arabic name may go back to a Babylonian form.316 The image connected with this Caput Algol is described as "like the head of a man, with a long beard, and some blood round the neck."317 Can we really be so sure that the bearded male head is (as it is commonly held) just a distortion of the Greek Gorgoneion image by some Arab who did not know the Medusa-myth?318 Could the Arabs not have fallen back on fragments of the older story, on Humbaba, or Kingu, or the Notes 302 to 318, see p. 237.</page><page sequence="24">212 A. A. BARB "headless god"? Besides Hellenistic (and Graeco-Egyptian) sources there were still Babylonian traditions alive (through Harran). The blood showing round the neck is not to be found on Greek, Etruscan or Roman Gorgoneia. But it was obviously considered as important,319 as the positive, the life-giving side of the otherwise dismal, petrifying symbol. It is carefully mentioned in the mediaeval stone-books320 where this head, engraved in Adamas (i.e. not diamond but haematite = bloodstone321) is praised as a talisman, bestowing victory and valour, invulnerability, and favour with kings and princes-not indeed an "apotropaion" but a bounty like the positive drop of blood from the generally lethal Gorgon's Head. However that may be, the male Gorgoneion was never as popular as the female Medusa. Her intimate connexions with certain manifestations of the mother-goddess (Persephone, Demeter) have recently been stressed by K. Kerdnyi.322 "We could say that through the figure of Persephone, the stately Queen of Hades, we glimpse the Gorgon,"323 and about the former he writes: "in Persephone the sublimest beauty as well as the most hideous ugliness has its foundation. Not-being324 can put on an alluring face, and the goddess of the dead can appear in the form of an hetaera."325 Kerenyi quotes Winckelmann as saying "Strictly speaking, a beautiful person is beautiful for a moment only," and he continues: "Or we can regard it from the point of view of that instant after which not-being comes, like a dark abyss."326 It is this tantalizing ambivalence which, I think, a "gnostic" intaglio in Vienna (here reproduced on P1. 33f)327 tries hard to express. Above the winged Gorgon's Head on the obverse we see the three Charites-supreme manifestation of female grace; the reverse of the stone shows, surmounted by a conventional tropaion (expressing victory?),328 another trinity-the three-headed and six-armed Hekate, the Queen of Hell. We can call her by her Babylonian name Ereschigal-for this old name, amazingly recalled from a remote past, has been added to the familiar Greek Hekate-representations on several of these amulets by the engravers of Graeco-Roman times.329 More than a generation ago, still unaffected, as far as I can see, by modern psychoanalysis (although branded as "modernist" in matters theological), an Italian scholar has well summarized this complex in his study on the Baby- lonian roots of gnosticism :330 " Ma anche distolto dal caos il nome e il valore di Madre (assorbito dal Padre maschio-femmina),331 anche scissa Sophia in due, l'una entitd celeste e pura, e l'altra terrestre e corrotta, la teologia gnostica non e pervenuta a liberarsi dal presupposto mitologico, radicato senza dubbio nella fede popolare, di una deita femminile suprema, che insieme k Madre e Figlia,332 Verginepura della luce, e abbietta cortigiana333 delle tenebre, principio in pari tempo generatore del bene e del male, prototipo di verginitd, di maternitd, di lussuria, oggetto di amore e di orrore, di riverenza a un tempo e di terrore.

Pieper's paper, written with the intention of demon- strating that these gems rightly belong to the Egyptian amulets and not to the Greek en- graved gems (cf. loc. cit., p. 134) shows rather scanty knowledge of the material and the older literature, although some of his obser- vations are certainly correct. But how com- pletely Egyptologists failed to make use of this important material for late Egyptian popu- lar religion can be seen with regret in H. Bonnet's Reallexikon der aegyptischen Religions- geschichte, Berlin, 1952. On the other hand the Seminary for Christian Archaeology at the University of Berlin started a collection of casts of these amulets, as they appeared to be connected with the history of "Gnosis" in its widest sense; cf. H. Lietzmann in For- schungen und Fortschritte, 933, P. 154 f. 11They are now in the Department of British and Mediaeval Antiquities, which also comprises Christian Archaeology (see the note above). I have to thank the keeper and staff of the Department for generously granted facilities for study and the trustees of the B.M. for the permission to reproduce a number of these gems. 12 Cf. e.g., Journal of the Warburg and Cour- tauld Institutes, XII, 1949, p. 25, note i. 13 Campbell Bonner, Studies in magical amu- lets, chiefly Graeco-Egyptian.

W. King and the Earl of Southesk had already pointed to the right interpretation, cf. Bonner, SMA, p. 83, notes 18-20. 22To the extensive material about the "Key," collected by W. K6hler (Archiv far Religionswissenschaft, VIII, 1905, p. 214 ff.) further references concerning the "Key of the Womb" have been added by Delatte (loc. cit., pp. 83-85) and Bonner (SMA, p. 85, n. 28). Cf. also my notes in the Journal of the Warburg Institute, XI, 1948, pp. 59 and 64/5. The key in the hand of the Mithraic Kronos ("Aion") is called the "Key of Birth" by Nonnos, Dionysiaca, VII, 23. 23 Contrary to Delatte and Bonner I see the primary purpose of these uterus-amulets in the furthering of child-bearing, cf. my notes in Syria, XXIX, 1952, p. 279. I have stressed loc. cit. the connexion between the material of these amulets (Haematite-the blood-stop- ping stone) and pregnancy. I should have also referred to Abyssinian charms for child- bearing (cf. W. H. Worrell in Zeitschrift far Assyriologie, XXIII, 1909, pp. 149 ff., and XXIV, 1910, p. 59 ff.). To ensure pregnancy the "stopping of the blood" (viz. of the menses) is asked for (Worrell, loc. cit., p. 175, n. 8; p. 179, n. 6; etc.), and the symbol of the key too seems suggested, when the woman asks God "to lock in the blood" (loc. cit., p. 86); "to open" means to cause abortion (loc. cit., p. 88). When, on the other hand, the texts on amulet-gems as well as in papyrus-incantations (Preisendanz, Papyri Graecae Magicae, II, p. 12 [Pap. VII, 260 if.], cf. also ibid., p. 199 f. ([Pap. 12] ) deal with returning and fixing the mitra to its proper place that does not mean (as is usually sug- gested) rectifying a "prolapsus uteri" but re- flects the well-known conception of the uterus as a kind of independent animal (toad, frog), roaming about inside the body, causing all kinds of pain and threatening with suffocation (globus hystericus). A "cure for making the uterus return to its position" already occurs in old-Egyptian magic, cf. Papyrus Ebers, 94, 7-8; F. Lexa, La magie dans L'Egypte antique, II, 1925, p. i i , XXVII; see also F.

Bellini, a.o.), I, 1865, tries to make a clear distinction between amatista (ametisto = amethyst) and amatita (= hae- matite), but see the more comprehensive references in the Vocabulario universale della lingua italiana (B. Bellini, G. Codogni, a.o.), I, 1852, s.v. Amatita. 37 According to Pseudo-Dioscurides, 7ept oe0ov, 4 (cf. F. de Mely, Les lapidaires de l'an- tiquiti, II, p. 179) the haematite is called "by the Romans" haimatista (tXLtErlcrv). In modern Greece one finds (cf. S. Seligmann, Die magischen Heil- und Schutzmittel, 1927, S. 251) the name (hai)matostates = the blood-stopper (cf. aoraov rb ar'txo on the haematite amulet mentioned by Bonner, SMA, p. 89). Only with late Greek forms like haimatista or haimatostates in mind we can understand the seemingly queer 12th-century etymology in Joannes Platearius' De simplici medicina, who explains the name ematites ("ab ema quod est sanguis et ites quod est sistens" (Ed. Lugd. 1524, fol. 19-obviously corrupt from something like ematistes . . . emat . . . istes). This etymology we find repeated in Vi- centius Belovacensis, Speculum Naturale, VIII, 68 as "emath sanguis, thitel sistens" (Ed. Venet. 1494, fol. 87; the edition Duaci 1624 tries to emendate this nonsense transcribing "acl.t sanguis, tleEroct sistit"). The blunder is carried on in Camillus Leonardus, Speculum lapidum (Ed. Venet, 1502, fol. 30o, ed. Ham- burg, 1717, p. 75) who explains the name emathitis sive emathites from "emeth idem quod sanguis, titel vero sistens; nam principalis virtus eius est sanguinem sistere." The Catalogue des drogues of the French royal druggist Pierre Pomet (Paris, 1709, p. 6) still preserves the correct ("Roman") word for the "blood- stopping" stone, calling the haematite "ay- matiste." 3s So we find in Leonardus' (see above, note 37) excerpts from mediaeval magic lapidaries (op. cit., fol. 58 or p. I6o): "Equi spumantis et fervidi super quem niger (!) sedeat cum sceptro in manu figura in ematite sculpta: regnandi potestatem praebet ac amissam gratiam restaurat, etc." The same description, but more correct with "vir niger" and "figura sculpta in haematite" is printed in L. Bauschius, De lapide haematite et schisto, Leipzig, I665, p. 141 f. A few pages later we read in Leonardus (op. cit., fol. 6i or p. 171): "Equum spumantem et supra se sit vir tenens sceptrum in manu, si in ametisto sculptum reperies, scias istud sigillum prodesse ad omnes res ... et omnes principes et primates obedientes erunt, etc." (Similarly with amethysto in Joh. Trithemius, Veterum sophorum sigilla et imagines magicae, 1612, p. 23.) Cf. also the 13th-cent. MS. published in Archaeologia, XXX, 1844, p. 452, No. 5: "Si inveneris in ametisto sigillum taliter factum vel sculptum, s. equum spumantem et fervidum et de- super virum sedentem et sceptrum manu tenentem hoc sigillum his valet, qui potestatem exercent." (Simi- larly with ematite in a MS. published by Joan Evans, Magical Jewels of the Middle Ages, Oxford, 1922, P. 236.) It is obvious that the type described is the "Rider" (Solomon) as dealt with by Bonner, SMA, p. 208 ff. (plate XIV f.), a type which occurs only on haematite-gems. Similarly the "Eagle-stone" (basically a variety of haematite, as I tried to show in Journal of the Warburg Institute, XIII, 1950, p. 318, n. 5) is called amethistes by St. Jerome, Comm. in Is., 17, 66/13-14 (Migne, P.L., 24, 662), better amatistis in Vicentius Bellovacensis, Speculum Naturale, XVI, 35 (Ed.

He would have modified his rather too optimistic statement, SMA, p. viii, if instead of basing his work mainly on recent collections in America and well-docu- mented finds from Syria and Egypt he had studied the complete collections in Vienna, Paris and London (British Museum).

(referred to from now on as "Hesperia, loc. cit."), although dealing only with a fraction of the B.M. material, the question of obvious forgeries comes much more to the foreground. Very strong mis- givings about the number of forgeries are expressed by A. Procop&amp;-Walter, who has studied the St. Petersburg collections: cf. Archiv fur Religionswissenschaft, XXX, I933, p. 41, note 3 (and 4), and pp. 47, 61 if., etc. We find that in Rubens' times prices asked or offered for such gems were sufficiently high to pay well for the work spent on forging them, cf. Rooses-Ruelens, op. cit., III, pp. 192 and 212. 42According to the B.M. Inventory the stone was purchased in Cairo in I9o9. It has now been published by Bonner, Hesperia, loc. cit., p. 328 and plate 97 (No. 28) ; but Bonner does not recall the winged uterus of the Rubens-Peiresc gem in connexion with this "uterine symbol" whose "ligaments attached to the bottom might be taken for wings." 43 SMA, p. 54 ff., plates IV-V; Hesperia, loc. cit., Nos. 20-24, 26, 65-68.

For the rareness, if not general absence, of convin- cingly ass-headed representations of Seth on "gnostic" gems (except, of course, forgeries) cf. A. Procop&amp;-Walter, loc. cit. (see above, notes 18 and 41), p. 61 ff. On the other hand the "Dog" (xtyv) Anubis fits in well with Metra. The Greek kyon can mean both "dog" (see also below, note 149) and "the pregnant one" and as such Anubis was identified with the god "who himself begets and carries in his womb the universe," viz., the primeval Kronos (Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride, c. 44 [368F] ). About this hermaphroditic Kronos = Thalassa see above, p. 198. 46 There is a fragment (right half missing) of another haematite in the British Museum (Inv. No. 49085 = 56544) which appears to me most definitely engraved by the same hand. Obv. Anubis- (or Seth-??) headed anguipede standing to 1., in the raised right hand a dagger, in front of it star. Rev. Chnoubis(?)-serpent, erect to 1.; star as on obv. (here P1. 3Ib-c). 47 Cf., e.g., SMA, plate VI, Nos. 126, 132, 140; Hesperia, loc. cit., No. 26; here P1. 3Ih. 48 Cf. SMA, p. 59 and plate XIII, Nos. 279, 280; pl. XIV, nos. 286, 293. In A. Delatte's useful catalogue of magic characters (Mus6e Belge, XVIII, 1914, p. 73 ff.) these three signs are listed as Nos. 17, 22, 23. Neither Bonner nor Delatte attempt an interpretation. But it is certain that the eight-pointed star sign is the old Babylonian determinative for names of gods (cf. Boll-Bezold-Gundel, Stern- glaube und Sterndeutung, 1926, p. I I). The barred Z occurs as the seal of the (planet) Jupiter in the Arabic handbook of (funda- mentally hellenistic) magic, called Picatrix, cf. Studien der Bibliothek Warburg, XII (Pseudo- Magriti, Das Ziel des Weisen, Arabischer Text hrsg. von Hellmut Ritter), Leipzig, 1933, pp. 107 and 152 (Picatrix attributes to "Jupiter" among other domains "Greek language" and "monotheism," cf. loc. cit., p. 137). This sign is still used for Jupiter on astrological medals of the I7th century, cf. K. A. Nowotny, Numismatische Zeitschrift, Vienna, 74, 1951, plate III/7; Du Molinet, Le Cabinet de la bibliotheque de Saint-Genevieve, 1692, plate 31, No. V; A. Capello, Prodromus iconicus . . . , 1702, No. 2. See also W. Deonna, Revue des itudes grecques, XX, 1907, p. 376, figs. 29-30 and p. 380 about the barred Z, and p. 317 about the eight-pointed star (fig. 5.). 49 F. Rouquette in Bulletin de la socidtd fran- faise d'histoire de la midicine, XI, 1912, p. 382 ff. The "bicornuate uterus," known in modern human physiology as congenital malforma- tion only, is normal with most quadrupeds. It is contrasted with the human form by the father of modern anatomy, Andreas Vesalius, who shows (De corporis humani fabrica, 1543, lib. V, figs. 27-29) the forked uterus of a bitch and the curiously antennary uterus of an heifer (used as an Egyptian hieroglyph, see below, note 244). This more advanced scientific knowledge, although already to be found in antiquity (e.g., in Herophilus of</page><page sequence="29">DIVA MATRIX 217 Alexandria, ca. 330 B.c., who first systemati- cally dissected large numbers of human corpses, or in Soranus of Ephesus, 2nd cent. A.D.), was however never quite general. Cf. F. Weindler, Geschichte der gyndkologisch- anatomischen Abbildung, Dresden, 19o8; F. La Torre, L'utero attraverso i secoli, CittA di Castel- lano, 1917; H. Balss ("Die Zeugungslehre und Embryologie in der Antike") in QIuellen und Studien zur Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und der Medizin, V, 1936, esp. pp. 4-8; Th.

A typical group of nine such terra-cottas found more recently is reproduced in Notizie degli scavi, 1936, p. 459, fig. Io. S Meyer-Steinegg's conclusion that the annex represents the urinary bladder does not convince. As there was a medical belief that males are conceived in the right, females in the left part of the uterus, it seems possible that the terra-cotta wombs offered to procure offspring expressed the preference for either girl or boy by representing the left or right annex. Cf. Rouquette, loc. cit., pp. 383 ff., 388 f., 391 f., 394. Cf. our P1. 25f, g. 3 Cf. also Pliny, Nat. hist., XI, 209: (uterus) * . geminos sinus ab utraque parte laterum habet. It might have been easy to misunderstand Herophilus (see above, note 49) in this sense. Obviously meaning the ovaries he wrote that "grown to the uterus are also the 'twins' (testicles), one on each side" (quoted by Galenus, De usu partium, XIV, I1). There is also the expression "wings" (Greek: pterygdmata, Lat.: pinnacula), used by Soranus and others for the labia vulvae, which might have led to a representation of this kind. "4 According to Rouquette terracotta votives representing the uterus as smooth-surfaced are rather rare. The great majority have a horizontally corrugated surface as shown by Rouquette, loc. cit., figs. I, 3-7, 9, see our P1. 25g; I saw hundreds of this type in the dep6t of the National Museum in Rome. (For an explanation of this particu- larity cf. Rouquette, loc. cit., p. 379; Meyer- Steinegg, op. cit., p. 23, note 6.) G. Bellucci, II feticismo primitivo in Italia, Perugia, 1907, p. 36, fig. 15, reproduces a steatite amulet of similar corrugated form, representing accord- ing to him the uterus and found in an early iron age tomb. As regards engraved stones, however, I know only one example showing this corrugated type, viz., the "Tantalus" amulet, dealt with by Bonner, SMA, pp. 87- 89 and by me in Syria, XXIX, 1952, pp. 271- 284. But see also the following note. 55 Cf. SMA, plate VI, Nos. 126, 136, 137, 138 and the "octopus type" (cosmic uterus? cf. below, note 142), Nos. 139, I40, 145. I cannot subscribe to Bonner's suggestion, SMA, p. 90 f., that this latter type leads to the Medusa-shaped symbols on Byzantine amulets (see Appendix, p. 21o f.). The type No. 137, somewhat resembling a porcupine, might be connected with the prickly Tyrolean uterus votives mentioned by Bonner, SMA, p. 91 (could it be that the word hystera for the uterus was at some time mixed up with hystrix = por- cupine?). This type also helps, I think, to explain the curious "Canopus" type, SMA, plate X, No. 221, cf. pp. 147 and 290, and our P1. 3 Ia. I do not think that the examples given by Bonner for the "Canopus" type are all forgeries, although some probably are, and would suggest seeing here a personification of (Isis?-)M~tra, the Uterus being repre- sented in the "corrugated" form discussed above. The five-pointed star (not six-pointed, as Bonner writes, p. 290), apparently regu- larly connected with this representation, is the symbol for Hygi(ei)a (cf. P. Perdrizet, Negotium perambulans in tenebris, Strasbourg, 1922, p. 35 if.); Hygia as the appropriately chosen name of a midwife (obstetrix) occurs in a Roman inscription (Corpus Inscript. Latin., VI/2, 4458). The "Canopic jars" con- nected with this type by B. H. Stricker ("Een egyptisch Cultusbeeld uit grieksch-romein- schen tijd," Oudheidkund. Mededeelingen, N. S., XXIV, pp. I-Io [Internat. Archiv fiir Ethno- graphic, XLIV, 1943] ) were brought together by others (cf. Stricker's quotations, loc. cit., p. 8) with the "aniconic" form (or "omphalos") 4</page><page sequence="30">218 A. A. BARB of Amon (SMA, pp. 37 f.-here too a human head is later added to what was originally some part of the entrails). I shall have to say more about this symbol below (see notes II o- "I5). 56 The majority of western mediaeval lapi- daries, seemingly having scruples about the manufacture of magic amulets, preferred to "find" the stone already engraved (cf. ab6ve, note 38, and Leonardus, op. cit., lib. III, c. 3), even suggesting that the engraving had not been done by human hands at all but by nature or divine creation. In "Picatrix," however (see above, note 48), we find numerous prescriptions for engraving magic ring-stones, prescriptions which found their way into other similar works and must at least occasionally, have led to the actual fabrication of such amulets. I should like to give here just one example: Bonner, in Hesperia, loc. cit., pp. 305 f. and 338 (No. 62), deals with a strange crowned figure above four (winged) angels. The wings are quite distinct on a specimen of this type in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (Inv. No. I257). It corresponds fairly accurately to a Jupiter-amulet, described by Cornelius Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, lib. II, c. 39, and to a similar description in Ps. Trithemius, Veterum sophorum sigilla . . ., 1612, p. 16. But an exact prescription for the fabrication of this amulet (expressly stating that the four figures bearing the throne of the crowned figure must be winged) can be read in Picatrix, Part II, Sect. io. The original conception goes back, I think, to Psalm xcviii (xcix). i: "Dominus regnavit . . . qui sedet super Cherubim . . ." 57 Cf. E. Bonnaff6, Dictionnaire des amateurs fran;ais au XVIIe siecle, Paris, 1884, p. 51 f. 58 SMA, p. 82 f. 59 Bonnaff6 quotes from a letter by Peiresc about Chaduc's collection: ". .. ha messo insieme ducenti amuleti di corniole, agathe et altre gemme,'con inscrittioni le pif" rare, et le piui stranne che si possino imaginare, dove veggono rappresentate tutte le magior forfanterie amorose di tutta 1'anti- quital Greca et Romana et se non fosse l'obscenitad, forse non si potrebbe vedere cosa piz' curiosa, tra le cose antique." A more comprehensive and probably more balanced description of the collection is given by Claude Du Molinet, Le cabinet df la bibliothIque de Sainte Genevikve, Paris, 1692, p. I 9 f. (This library had received Chaduc's catalogue as well as the majority[?] of his gems.) The "forfanterie amorose" which seemed to Peiresc of paramount interest are passed by with charitable silence in Father Du Molinet's book. 60 "per cio che gli non ha cose pill utile in questo genere per provare che la lumaga rappresenti il sesso femineo di che egli cerca authorith con tanto ardore" (Peiresc to Rubens, loc. cit., p. 203). 61 Loc. cit., p. 216. 62 Charles-Cesar Baudelot de Dairval, De l'utilite' des voyages . . . et l'avantage que la re- cherche de tout ces antiquite's procure aux sfavants, Ed. Paris, 1693, p. 343; cf. also ibidem, p. 312 f. 63 A. Letronne's assertion (Revue archeolo- gique, III, 1846, p. 258 ff.) that the planetary signs as used to-day do not appear before the 15th century, and that engraved stones which show these signs are modern fabrications, still appears to be correct. Cf. A. Wiedemann in Byzantinische Zeitschrift, XIX, I910, p. 145 fo This fact does not however exclude the possi- bility that the modern signs developed from certain antique symbols, cf. also C. O. Zuretti, Alchimimistica signa (Cat. des MSS. alchim. grecs, vol. VIII), Brussels, 1932. On the sign for Venus in particular see below, note 97. 64Cf. J. J. Winckelmann, Description des pierres gravies du feu Baron de Stosch, p. 443 f. (No. 237). On several of these stones the snail is combined with phalli. L. Stephani, Compte rendu . . . pour les annies 1870-71, I874, p. 20, note 6, infers from these stones that there must have been some ancient monu- ments identifying the snail with the female pudenda. But his arguments are not con- clusive. What Winckelmann, op. cit., and in addition Ch. A. Klotz, Historia numorum con- tumeliosorum et satyricorum, 1765, p. 8, quote from ancient authors shows only that the snail might have been a symbol of lewdness and a nickname for whores. 6e Sueton, Claudius, 26, 2; 29, 3. Does per- haps the number XXIIII(?) in the exergue of Chaduc's gem refer to the saucy story told by Pliny, Nat. Hist., X, 172? 66 ZDTHP KOZMOT is engraved on the pedestal of a bronze bust showing as head an erect phallus with a cock's comb (reproduced from the collections of R. Fabretti by Michelange de la Chausse, Le grand cabinet romain, 1 7o6, fig. I of the plate facing p. 123), possibly (note the reversed Z) a forgery. It is however known that certain gnostics, cf. Hippolytus, op. cit., V, 26, 32 ff. (ed. Wend- land, p. 132), saw in Priapus ("the Good") the first principle of cosmic creation. As such he is identified with Pan-Pantheos, e.g. in the</page><page sequence="31">DIVA MATRIX 219 inscription of Tibur, Corpus Inscript. Latin., XIV, 3565; for further references see H. Herter, De Priapo, 1932, esp. pp. 236-239. Cf. also Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopddie, s.v. Phallos, esp. 1723 ff. 67 We are fortunate in having the clues of C. SILIU(s) and MES(salina) to explain what otherwise may appear to be completely nonsensical inscriptions. Still it is hard to believe that any meaning at all can be found behind some of the inscriptions on the for- geries in Chaduc's collection, see, e.g., the example reproduced by Baudelot de Dairval, op. cit., p. 394. The familiar planetary signs (cf. above, note 63) and the same kind of intriguing word-fragments occur on a group of obviously faked gems in the Cabinet de Medailles (Chabouillet, op. cit., Nos. 2240-41, 2243-44, 2246-49)-cf., e.g., No. 2243: "LVCR COL VX FELL." As the majority of them were reproduced already in Du Molinet's Cabinet de Sainte- Genevilve (see above note 59) it is likely that these gems too came from Chaduc's collection and were engraved by the same forger. The work of this man seems also to be recognizable on a large number of fakes in the collection of J. de Wilde (Gemmae selectae e museo Jacobi de Wilde, Amsterdam, 1703), cf. especially his use of the column- or altar-shaped pedestal (Nos. 4, i6, 66, 71, 72, 93, 98, I20-I22, 128, 167-this pedestal occurs also on the "Se- pulius Macer" forgery exposed by Letronne, loc. cit. [see above note 63]), of the astrological signs (Nos. I6, Io2, 175, I86) or of the word FELIX (Nos. 94, Ioo, 125, 175; the XXIIH in the exergue of the Chaduc gem has its parallel in XXX on the same place of de Wilde's No. 123 and even the same snail as on Chaduc's gem occurs (No. 75), in an abso- lutely absurd combination. The forger seems to have been careful to give abbreviated words, both to conceal his ignorance and to leave ample scope for ingenious interpretations by scholars. It is quite amusing to read how de Wilde solves all this startling nonsense, but that does not encourage similar attempts. 68 Bonner, SMA, p. 80. 69 SMA, p. 8i, n. 8. 70 I, 35 or I, 31 in other editions. 71 Epiphanius, Panarion haereseon, XXV, 5, 1-3 (ed. Holl, p. 272 f.). 72 Hippolytus, Refutatio omnium haeresium, V, I9, Ii (ed. Wendland, p. i 18, Io ff.); we find the same doctrines of the Sethians almost verbatim repeated in the summary, op. cit., X, Ii, 6 (ed. Wendland, p. 271, 7 ff.). 73 For a clearer explanation of the terminus oppaytg as the "impressions" of any single one of the innumerable "powers" of each of the three "principles," originating at the contact with each other see Hippolytus, op. cit., V, I9, 9-Io and I2 (ed. cit., p. 118, 2 ff. and 17 ff.). Cf. also F. J. Doelger, Sphragis, Pader- born, 1911. 74 We get some idea of the cosmic sym- bolism of the uterus as seen by another gnostic sect from Hippolytus' account of the teach- ings of Simon Magus (op. cit., VI, I4, 8 ff.; cf. Genesis ii. 8 ff.) : The uterus is the Paradise, the placenta (chorion) is Eden, the "river going out of Eden to water the Paradise" is the navel (omphalos), cf. below, note I15. As this river is "parted in four heads" so there are two arteries and two veins at the two sides of the omphalos (etc.). See also the comments on this symbolism by R. Eisler, Weltenmantel und Himmelszelt, Munich, I9Io0, II, p. 478 ff. Eisler explains the omphalos in this connexion as the cosmic "Navel-Mountain" from which the river descends divided in four arms. Cf. also the notes I05 and 115 below, and W. Gaerte in Anthropos, IX, 1914, p. 956 ff., on "Erdberg, Himmelsberg, Erdnabel und Welt- str6me." 75 This recalls the conception of the "Abyssus" (Ocean as well as Hell) of the Bible. The dark "Tehom" over which ("over the waters") the "Spirit of God was hovering" (Genesis i. 2) must one way or the other have some connexion with this heretical cosmology. Cf. also on these conceptions A. Dupont- Sommer, La doctrine gnostique de la lettre " Wdw," Paris, I946, p. 64 ff. The implied impregnation of the Chaos-Ocean by the "Spirit" appears as it were repeated in the mythology of the Sethians as further ex- pounded by Hippolytus :The "stormy Wind," firstborn of the Ocean, raises from the sea the "Wave" and impregnates her-the first female. We shall return to this conception of the sea-born Aphrodite later (see p. 205 f.). 76 Hippolytus, op. cit., V, 20, 4-5 (ed. Wend- land, p. 121, 21 ff.); O.

BARB The word "Thalassa" connected with the names Iao Sabaoth Adoneie and with "Darkness of the Nether World" occurs on the reverse of a haematite gem in Paris (the obverse shows Aphrodite Anadyomene drying her hair), cf. Chabouillet, Catalogue glne'ral des camies, Paris, 1858, p. 305, No. 2239. The v xccav, 6xesv of the magical papyri (P.G.M., I, pap. III, 144 and pap. IV, 1642) may have some connexion with this conception, perhaps also the as yet unex- plained "Okeane"-acclamation (cf. E. Peter- son, Heis Theos, p. 141, n. 2 and p. 312). See also C. G. Jung and C. Kerenyi, Essays on a Science of Mythology, New York, 1950, p. 63 ff., about "the primal waters conceived as "womb," and p. 91 on "the prime element whose symbol . . . is the sea"; also ibid., Index, s.v. "womb," and L. Frobenius, Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes, I, 1904, p. 265 ff. 81 On the other hand Kronos was for the Peratae the element of Water as a symbol of death and destruction, cf. Hippolytus, op. cit., V, x6 (ed. cit., p. iii). It seems easy to identify Kronos [Saturnus] with Okeanos, both being names for the primeval old god. The god resting on top of the round Mithras relief in Spalato (cf. Bull. Arch. e Storia Dal- mata, 1909, P1. VII, 2. and Vermaseren in Studia Archaeologica, G. van Hoorn oblata, 1951, pl. XXIII, 8), interpreted by Vermaseren (loc. cit., p. I04) as Saturnus, is more likely Okeanos, as the circle with four marine animals (crocodile, dolphin, lobster and conch [not snail]) seems to indicate. Cf. also below, note 290. 82 In a magic papyrus (P.G.M., I, pap. IV, 3086 ff.) Kronos is invoked as "the Founder of the whole world, injured by his own son, bound by Helios with iron chains, of both sexes, Father of thunder and lightning, Ruler of the Netherworld"; cf. also S. Eitrem, "Kronos in der Magie," Milanges Bidez, 1934, p. 351i ff. 8 C. Muiller, Fragmenta Historicorum Graeco- rum, II, 1848, p. 497 f. " The name is differently transmitted and the various attempts to explain it are not convincing. 85 "Chaldean" Thalatth for Greek Thalassa is the same kind of (Graeco-) Aramaic jargon which, I think, produced from the Greek Abyssos the female archdemon Abyzouth (Obyzouth), cf. H. A. Winkler, Salomo und die Karina, Stuttgart, 1931, pp. I 0-112, 178 f.; P. Perdrizet, Negotium perambulans in tenebris, Strasbourg, 1922.

Pritchard, Prince- ton, 1950, p. 67. The translation "like a shellfish," previously only tentative (E. Ebe- ling [i92i]: "wie eine Muschel?", R. Labat [1935]: "comme un coquillage?") seems now generally accepted. About the symbolism of the conch see p. 204 f. 88 See above, note 82. 89 See also R. Eisler, Weltenmantel und Him- melszelt, II, p. 397, note I. Eisler shows that the words Mjtra and Chaos are "not only synonymous but also isopsephic," i.e., that the numeral value of the letters of each adds up to the same sum (56). The esoteric use of isopsephy is well known from gnostic and cabalistic systems; according to Eisler (op. cit., p. 698 ff.) it is to be found already in the philosophy of Heraclitus (ca. 500 B.c.). Kereny finds (op. cit., see above, note 8o) that "in the epoch of the great Ionian thinkers the cosmic content that forms the nucleus of mythology passes over in Greek philosophy." 90 A. Deimel, Pantheon Babylonicum, 1914, p. 208 f., No. 2576. See also the references in the following note. The "Lady of the Mountain" closely resembles the "Magna Mater" of Asia Minor and other later types of Mother-Goddesses. Now R. Eisler has shown that the name of Kybele (and similar goddesses of the Near East) is derived from a root KU(M)BA = "the Womb" ("Kuba- Kybele," Philologus, 68, 1909, p. 18 ff.). On the other hand H. Frankfort (op. cit., see the following note) mentions that "Ninhursaga is in one list called simply Uterus." Cf. also W. F. Albright, "The Anatolian Goddess Kubaba," Archiv fir Orientforschung, V, p. 229 ff. 91 M. Ebert, Reallexikon der Vorgeschichte, IV/2, p. 431 ("Band"). E.

H. Frankfort, "A Note on the Lady of Birth," Journal of Near Eastern Studies, III, 1944, pp. I98-200. Van Buren's explanation of the symbols on the Iraq Museum and Louvre terra-cotta plaques as swaddling bands hung from pegs "do not really account for the shape very well" (Frankfort, loc. cit., p. I98). I think we can safely accept that the Omega-shaped</page><page sequence="33">DIVA MATRIX 221 symbol is a simplified form of the uterus ("the bicornate uterus of a heifer"?--see the refer- ences given by Frankfort, loc. cit., p. 200, n. 9), in the case of the clay reliefs mentioned above perhaps "the womb with the navel (omphalos) in the middle," to quote the words of St. Hippolytus (cf. above, p. 198). I fail to understand why Van Buren, while listing various other explanations ("weighing scales, the yoke of a chariot pole, a head band, or a wig") and admitting the similarity with the Hittite ideogram for "Life", does not even mention the Uterus-explanation, although quot- ing Frankfort's paper and in spite of the fact that M. Jastrow, jr., Bildermappe zur Religion Babyloniens und Assyriens, Giessen, 1912, does not mention any other explanation than this one ("Vulva?", cf. op. cit., Text on No. 29, also on Nos. 28, 39-45, 47). It seems to me that this symbol lives on in amulets like those published by R. Mouterde, "Le glaive de Dardanos," Milanges de l'Universitl Saint- Joseph (Beyrouth), XV/3, 1930, p. 80, fig. 12 and p. 99, fig. 28, blending later in orna- mental symbolism with certain kinds of peltae amazonarum and lunulae (see Pls. 28g-h; 32e). 92 Pl. 27a-f, after C. W. King, Babylonian Boundary-Stones and Memorial Tablets in the B.M., 1912, pl. xliv/9o084o; 24/104415; i/102485; 14/90922; lxxvi/9o835; xc/ 90858. Pls. 27g-h, 28c, after W. J.

The knife sometimes accompanying the Uterus-symbol (as on the stone reproduced by Frankfort, op. cit.), has tentatively been explained as destined to cut the navel cord. Could it have something to do with the cut- ting in two of the primeval uterus to divide Heaven and Earth? Cf. also the Tiibingen thesis by W. Staudacher, Die Trennung von Himmel und Erde.

We reproduce from this paper our P1. 28a, d. 95 It might be pertinent to refer here to my observations in this Journal, XIII, I950, p. 321, note 2 about the Egyptian hieroglyph "vulture" signifying the goddess Mut and also "Mother" and "Compassion" and about a similar Semitic correlation obvious in the Hebrew t l 1 meaning (a) "Vulture," (b) "Uterus," (c) "Loving Kindness." Here lies the reason for the vulture-emblem worn by mother-goddesses like Hathor, Mut, or Isis, for the two vulture-heads which Mut has besides her human head in certain representa- tions (Ninhursag also shows three heads on the terra-cotta reliefs published by Van Buren!). On the other hand these correla- tions might throw some light on the Sumerian mythological text, according to which Nin- hursag heals the ailing Enki "in her vulva" (Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern Texts [see above, note 87], pp. 37 and 40, notes 1o and 52). There is an odd parallel to this con- ception in the alchemistic treaty Rosarium philosophorum as quoted by C. G. Jung, Psychologie und Alchemie, 1944, P. 459, n. x. 9 Man, XI, 1911, p. 117. 97 On the similarity of the Babylonian Ninhursag-Uterus-symbol and the Hittite hieroglyph for "Life" cf. above, note 91. W. Budge, Amulets and Superstitions, 1930, p. 134 f., thinks that the Ankh-sign origin- ally represented "probably some part of the human body which the Egyptians be- lieved to be intimately connected with genera- tion," but that later they "did not know what object it represented." Just as the Babylonian symbol is explained as "band" so the hiero- glyphs Sa and Ankh are thought by some scholars to represent some kind of bands (Sa: "girdle of Isis"; Ankh: "a man's girdle"). A third, similar, symbol, the Tjet ("Knot of Isis"?) was according to Budge (op. cit., p. 137, n. i) "intended to represent the vulva or matrix of Isis." It is probably more than a coincidence that in Coptic art the Ankh sign often resembles the familiar sign for Venus - (cf. Maria Cramer, Das altaegyptische Lebenszeichen im christlichen (koptischen) Aegypten, 2nd ed., Vienna, 1943, plates, figs. 46-47 and passim.

Budge, The gods of the Egyptians, I, p. 428 ff.; H. Bonnet, Reallexikon der dgyptischen Religionsgeschichte, p. 277 ff. The name Hathor means "House of Horus" and it should be noted what R. Eisler, Philologus, LXVIII, 1909, p. 164 ff., has to say about the mother- goddess as "house" = womb, observations which dovetail with those by H. Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, 1948, p. I7I.

An ultimate derivation of this coiffure from a Babylonian uterus-symbol does not exclude the possibility that, when and where the origin was forgotten the "wig" really was interpreted as plaits of hair; actually there exists another (later?) type of Hathor-head, where the arrangement of the hair has abandoned the omega-shape. Still, it might be that the old importance of just this part of the Hathor-representation was felt, when the hair of Hathor, as we are told, "plays an important part in Egyptian mytho- logy" (Muiller, as quoted by Hinke, op. cit., p. 245, footnote); cf. also my observations in this Journal, XI, 1949, p. 62, n. ix, and below, note 200. o00 If the sistrum originated from a simple rattle, i.e. a hollow body containing loose objects, it could have been compared to the pregnant womb, just as it actually happened with similar, natural stone-concretions ("Eagle-Stones," see this Journal, XIII, 195o, p. 317). C. W. King, The Gnostics, 2nd ed., p. iII f., suggests that the sistrum "got its peculiar outline from the Indian Yoni" (King, however, sees the female sex emblem also in the almond and in the vesica piscis). 101 See Illustrated London News, 1931, p. 8io, fig. 20; 1934, P. 979, fig.

Al- though assembling a wealth of information, Roscher, while overstressing the idea of the omphalos as centre of the earth, neglects the more primitive and probably older meaning of the omphalos as marking the place of the womb, i.e. of the interior of the earth. This womb of the earth is the realm of the dead and at the same time the place of the primeval "waters of the deep." So the omphalos is sometimes conceived as the stone preventing these waters from breaking forth and delug- ing the earth; on the other hand it marks the spot from where contact (e.g. for the purpose of divination) with the nether world is more easily possible.

I98), of the "womb with the navel in its middle" and we can understand how Heracles' wife Omphale (omphalos = navel) became identified by the Gnostics with Babel (i.e. Astarte) and Aphrodite (Hippolytus, op. cit., V, 26, 28); cf. also Eisler, Philologus, LXVIII, p. I39. For omphalos-=belly cf. e.g. Nicander, Theriaca, v. 341. It is interesting to note that in modern Greek charms the "omphalos" assumes the role of the roaming "hystera" (see above, note 23), cf. Ph. P. Argenti and H. J. Rose, The Folk- Lore of Chios, I, p. 404.

Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, Chicago, 1948, p. 71 ff. and passim (see index, s.v. "Placenta"). The connexion of this "placenta of the King" with the god Khonsu, who with Amon and Mut (see above, note 95; the latter is occasionally represented as bi- sexual!) forms a rather artificially constructed trinity, again points towards the "omphalos"- Amon. With the "navel" of Amon and the "placenta" of Khonsu one might compare the "kidneys" of Hadad (cf. Barb, Syria, loc. cit.-see above, note 23) and the "liver" of Jahve (Eisler, Philologus, LXVIII, p. 138). x115 See above, note 74. The "navel" going out from the placenta in the quotation from Hippolytus appears to be not the navel proper but the umbilical cord (Om- phalos and umbilicus are uniformly used by Greek and Roman medical writers both for the navel and the umbilical cord, cf. J. Hyrtl, Onomatologia anatomica, 1 88o, p. 582). This umbilical cord seems to be represented with the "placenta" on the Egyptian standards (cf. Man, XI, p. I65 ff.). For more recent beliefs and superstitions about the placenta see Handwirterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens, VI, cols. 760-766 (also passim, see index- volume s.v. "Nachgeburt") and E.

Elliot Smith, The Evolution of the Dragon, pp. 47-52, and below, note 205. 116 The symbolism of Egyptian divine images was so very different from Greek and Roman conceptions that it was open to cheap derision just as well as to wild philosophical or theo- sophical interpretation. It seems best to take most of their divine images as "pictograms not portraits" (H. Frankfort, Ancient Egyptian Religion, p. 12), even as a "rebus" (S. Schott in Abhandl. d. Akad. d. Wiss. Mainz, Geistes- und</page><page sequence="38">224 A. A. BARB sozialwiss. Kl., I950/24. p. I715). A very fair statement of the Egyptian point of view as still alive in the 3rd cent. A.D. can be found in Philostratus, Vita Apollonii Tyanensis, VI, 19 (I am quoting from the translation by F. C. Conybeare, Loeb class. libr., II, 79): "You criticize our religion very superficially; for if the Egyptians have any wisdom, they show it by their deep respect and reverence in the representation of the gods, and by the circum- stance that they fashion their forms as symbols of a profound inner meaning, so as to enhance their solemnity and august character." Apol- lonius, however, according to Philostratus by no means an admirer of the Egyptians (whom he thought far inferior to the Indian philo- sophers), upholds with his usual exasperat- ingly priggish verbosity the classical, Hellenic, point of view. x17 Apuleius, Metamorphoses, XI, i i (ed. Helm, p. 275). A fairly good illustration to this account is provided by the relief of an Isis procession in Potsdam, published by M. Schede, Angelos, Archiv fiar neutestam. Zeitge- schichte, II, 1926, p. 6o f. and plate 4. Here, however, the symbolic vessel carried is of the Canopus type (see above, note 55). Cf. also the similar relief in R. Venuti and G. C. Amaduzzi, Vetera monumenta . . . , Rome, 1778, III, pl. 26/2 (see Addenda, p. 238). 118 See above, note 45. 119 This fourfold negation seems to refer to some important and very old conception. If we substitute for the three kinds of animals their generally accepted "kings" (bull, lion, eagle) we have (including man) the four faces of the cherubims according to the vision of Ezekiel i. 5- 10, reappearing in Revel. iv. 7 and as the well-known symbols of the four Evan- gelists. In the symbolism of Roman tomb- stones the Lion represents the Fire, the Eagle the Air, the Dolphin (as "king" of the "fish"-cf. O. Keller, op. cit. [see above, note io8]) the [sea-] Water; the water of springs and rivers seems to have been con- nected in ancient symbolism with the Bull. On the other hand the lids of the four "Canopic Jars" in which the entrails of the dead, removed in the course of mummifica- tion, were deposited, show the heads of a man, a dog, a jackal and a hawk ("the four children of Horus"). That seems to repre- sent again the four animated kinds of beings: man, bird, domestic quadruped (dog) and wild quadruped (jackal). no The solemn words with which Apuleius introduces his description of the object in question (the "argumentum ineffabile" is about the same as what Ker6nyi, op. cit. [see above, note 8o], p. 76, compares to "a melody that utters the unutterable" !) should warn us to expect something stranger than just a "kleiner goldener Krug, der mit wunderlichen dgyptischen Bildern geschmiickt ist" (so still A. Erman, Die Religion der Aegypter, 1934, p. 433). It might be noted too that among the Isis symbols carried in the procession Apuleius had mentioned already a golden "breast- shaped" vessel, from which milk was sprinkled. Teats and womb are comple- mentary symbols in the description of blessed motherhood (cf., e.g., Genesis xlix. 25 and Luke xi. 27). Some scholars have also sug- gested that the cista mystica carried in the Isis procession contained a phallos (see references in Pauly-Wissowa, R.E., s.v. Phallos, 1715, 68 ff.; see also Addenda, p. 238). 121 Cf. "Fundus" on P1. 25b. 122 Covered with figural reliefs are also the "aniconic" Amon symbols, cf. the illustra- tions given by Daressy and Wainwright (see above, note i i1), here P1. 3oe. The various figures represented on the more elaborate uterus intaglios, on top and sides of the mitra (cf. Pls. 3Id, f, h, 33e) can probably give an idea of the imagery embossed on the golden Isis-symbol in uterus-form; the small- ness of the gems made it impossible to engrave those images on their proper place, i.e. the surface of the matra. 123 Cf. "Orificium" on P1. 25b. 124 "Canalis" is, according to Celsus, De medicina, IV, i the correct medical name for what he also calls "Cervix" (for the latter see again P1. 25b) of the "Vulva." Cf. also Soranus, Gynaecia, ed. Rose, p. 8, 6 ff. 125This last sentence ("Eius orificium non altiuscule levatum in canalem porrectum longo rivulo prominebat") seems the obscurest part of the description. Since Beroaldus suggested in his commentary to the "Golden Ass" (Bologna 1500) that the "vessel" in question "fuisse nasutiorem . . . nasus dicitur in vasis rivulus ille prominens ex quo liquor egeritur" all the trans- lators accepted the explanation as "spout" (H. E. Butler's translation, Oxford, I9Io0, runs: "Its mouth projected into a long low spout with outstretched tube.") It might be that Apuleius himself relied here less on autopsy than on a written description which he did not fully understand. 126 "Ex alia parte vero multum recedens spatiosa dilatione adhaerebat ansa, quam contorto nodulo supersedebat aspis." Butler translates (loc. cit.) :</page><page sequence="39">DIVA MATRIX 225 "On the other side, with ample arch, ex- tended a long retreating handle, on which was set an asp with twisted coils, holding erect the streaked scales of its swelling neck." The Latin text does not use a word meaning "arch" and the description of the "handle" could well apply to the two snake-like appen- dices extending (horizontally) from the "fundus" of the uterus, cf. Pls. 25a, 31d-f, h. It is here that the Chnumis serpent, sitting erect, is often represented (cf. P1. 26f, and note 47). 127 Inv. No. 8ooi; our P1. 33d. Cf. the simi- lar, but less distinct specimen, SMA, P1. VII, No. 143, and the references to other ram- headed figures, SMA, p. 87. 128s About the god Bes see now Bonnet, Real- lexikon, p. Io0 ff.; his function as patron of childbirth is stressed by H. Epstein, Archiv. far Geschichte der Medizin, XI, 1919, p. 233 ff., cf. also Spiegelberg, Annales du service des anti- quites de l'Egypte, XXIX, 1929, p. 162 ff. In this context the female representations of Bes (see Bonnet, Reallexikon, s.v. Beset (p. i 16 ff.) and the Greek "Baubo" (Th. Wie- gand and H. Schrader, Priene, p. 162 f. and figs. 149-1 54; Ch. Picard, Revue de l'histoire des religions, XCV, 1927, p. 22o ff.) must also be taken into account. Harpocrates rising from the (head or headless body? of the) Bes-figure (see Pls. 31d, f; 33d) is obviously a variation of the so familiar representation (particularly frequent on "gnostic" gems) of Harpocrates sitting in the lotus-blossom. This latter image has appropriately been connected by Kerenyi, op. cit., pp. 66 and 67 f., with the Hindu "Primordial Child," sitting in a lotus-leaf in the world-ocean; the "world, shaped like a lotus, springs from the navel of the fish-bodied Vishnu when he lay in the world-ocean. Cf. also Jamblichus, De mysteriis, VII, 2 for the meaning of Harpocrates sitting on the lotus (and in the boat) and L. Frobenius, Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes, I, 1904, p. 271. For the Lotus-flower as equivalent to the cosmogonic Egg cf. F. Lukas, Zeitschrift fir Volkskunde, loc. cit. (below, note 230), p. 234 f. It may be consistent with all this symbolism to see in the Bes figure another emblem of the primeval womb; see also Appendix, p. 209 f. 129 It seems doubtful whether the round vessel, held on some gems in the raised hand of Isis (e.g., Bonner, Hesperia, loc. cit., pl. 97, No. 27 [B.M. 56543 = 480241]; another example in the British Museum is B.M. 56079, identical with Koehler, op. cit., No. 23, from the Townley collection, see our P1. 3 if.), means the uterine symbol, as has been thought possible by Bonner. Vessels of exactly this shape are used as hieroglyphic sign for "bowl" (a group of three of them, however, signifying Nun = the Abyss), cf.

Ruska, "Griech- ische Planetendarstellungen in arabischen Steinbiichern," Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberg. Akad. d. Wissenschaften, Phil.-hist. Kl., 1 9 9, 3, P. 44.

Graindor, Terres cuites de l'Egypte grico-romaine, Antwerp, 1939, pls. XI-XIII). Explanations of this type as "apotropaion" (Weber, op. cit., p. 165; similarly already O. Jahn, op. cit. [see above, note 4], P. 93 f.; about the "anasyrmos" cf. Ch. Picard, Eranos-Jahrbuch 1939, Ziurich, 1940, pp. ioi-io6, and lately J. Moreau in Mdlanges Henri Gregoire, III, 1951, p. 292 ff.) or as "Totenweib" (Weber, op. cit., p. 148 ff.) are not generally convincing. Some of these figures clearly stress, as Graindor (op. cit., p. oxO f.) has shown, the parturient condition of the woman (or rather goddess). Could the "Totenweib auf einem Sopha" (Weber, op. cit., No. 229, cf. also Perdrizet, Terres cuites No. 336) possibly be taken for a parturient woman on an accouchement chair (cf. also SMA, p. 93 f.)? It is interesting to compare the "Situs" figures of parturient women in 15th and I6th cent. anatomical works (cf. Weind- ling, op. cit., figs. 54-56) which show the same typical "prayer" attitude as Weber's "Toten- weiber" and Perdrizet's "Orantes." Cf. now also W Deonna, "La femme et la grenouille" (see above, note 23), p. 238. An Egyptian relief, reproduced by Spiegelberg, op. cit. (see above, note 128), p. 162, shows conclusively that the raising of the arms was supposed to facilitate parturition. 138 SMA, D(escription No.) I39, 140, 145 (=-B.M. 56389); Hesperia, loc. cit., No. 27 (= B.M. 48024). D 139 is from metal, a fact which Bonner (SMA, p. 275) noted as un- usual and remarkable. But he gave further examples for such metal casts in American Journal of Archaeology, LIII, 1949, p. 271 (after J. Keil, Jahreshefte des isterr. archdol. Instit., XXVI, p. I36 ff.) and Hesperia, loc. cit., p. 309 (Nos. 67 and 68). Another such bronze-cast (in Leningrad, the Hermitage, Inv. No. I 1323), repeating exactly the stone reproduced by Daremberg-Saglio, Dictionnaire, s.v. Gemmae, p. 1481, fig. 3532 (i.e. identical with Hesperia, loc. cit., No. 68 !) is mentioned by Procop&amp;-Walter, Archiv fiir Religionswissen- schaft, XXX, 1933, p. 45, note I. In the Vienna collection of gnostic gems there is- as far as I know unpublished-a cast of white metal (silver?) from a gnostic stone (Inv. No. 1211, Avers: Anguipede; Rs.: Magic inscription), in the British Museum (Inv. No. 56529) a bronze-cast from one of the typical, cabochon-shaped, Chnoumis stones. It is perfectly clear that in all these instances we have metal-casts made from stone intaglios, and this technique is expressly mentioned by Peiresc in connexion with his gift of gems to Rubens. He asked Rubens (Rooses-Ruelens, op. cit., p. 21o) to have made for him (when making casts from some other objects) casts of these gems "in lead or some other metal as one casts especially medals with inscriptions on the reverse so that the casts reproduce the original faithfully." Rubens comes back to this request in his answer (loc. cit., p. 216) regretting that he had not found time to make these casts, "not even in Spanish wax." It seems likely that some, if not all, the metal casts mentioned above, were made about this time, perhaps even in Rubens' workshop. 139 Cf. Bonner, SMA, pp. 84 f. and 90.

A gem of the Ustinow collection with the "squatting woman" on the obverse shows on the reverse a running dog (or jackal) with the legend Ororiouth, cf.

The three Kappas (KKK) so regularly connected with this gem engraving I should interpret (following U. F. Kopp and R. Heim) as the (Hebrew) Trishagion (Kadosh - Hagios = Sanctus). The Greek Hagios three times repeated is frequent on Byzantine (cf., e.g., SMA, D 324) and mediaeval amulets; but the Hebrew form too was much used (cf. "per nomen cados cados cados" in Cornelius Agrippa's apocryphal "Oeuvres magiques mises en franfais par Pierre D'Aban[!!], Rome, 1744" [= Lille, ca. 1830], p. 6I f., similarly pp. 46 f., 71). The K (or Hebrew p) was occasionally mis-read for R ("rados rados rados", cf. Perdrizet in Seminarium Kondakovianum, II, 1928, p. 261, note I). Sometimes we find on amulets, besides the KKK, what must be meant to give the non-Greek (Old-Hebrew or more likely Aramaic) equivalent of the triple K (cf., e.g., SMA, D io8). These three signs might in turn (barred to mark them as abbre- viation) be the origin of the "Chnoubis"- symbol (SMA, D 83 ff. and D 296) and the barred triple S, so frequent in the Middle Ages, could have been read as "sanctus sanctus sanctus." Cf. also E. Williger, Hagios, Giessen, 1922, p. 99. s151 Cf. above, p. 197. The same antithesis of male and female principle might also be found on the "Tantalus" gem, see references above, note 54. s152 "Wie sollte man noch weiter zurfick- gehen k6nnen als in den miitterlichen Uterus?", C. G. Jung, Symbole der Wandlung, I952, p. 570. 1s3 Literature see A. B. Cook, Zeus, I, p. 191 f. The paper by K. Preisendanz, "Aus der Ge- schichte des Uroboros," Brauch und Sinnbild (Anniversary volume for Eugen Fehrle, Karlsruhe, 1940) has not so far been accessible to me. See now also W. Deonna, "Ouro- boros," Artibus Asiae, XV, I952, p. i63 if. 1s4 Inv. No. 56079, here reproduced (P1. 3 if); this stone seems identical with Koehler, op. cit., No. 23 (Collection Townley). For IAM see above note 44. The fact that this name very often occurs inscribed on the shield held by the "Anguipede" obviously does not mean that the anguipede equals Ia6, but rather that the shield equals Ia6: cf. Genesis xv. I where God calls himself a "Shield" (Hebr. Magen) for Abraham, and Psalms iii. 4; xxviii. 7; xxxiii. o20; lix. I2; lxxxiv. Io; lxxxix. 19; cxix. 1 14; cxliv. 2, where he is called so (in the Hebrew text) by the psalmist; see also 2 Samuel xxii. 3. I think Bonner tends to underestimate the definitive Jewish component in these amulets, just as the Gnostic component (see below, notes 157, 158). 155 Pap. Graec. Magicae, I, Pap. V, I58. 156 There seems to exist some confusion be- tween "Heart" and "Stomach," evident in Greek kardialgia (= Heartburn); on the other hand we saw "Stomach" used for "Uterus" (see above, note 105). Mgtra and kardia appear to be used as synonyms in a Greek charm, cf. A. Delatte, Anecdota Athenien- sia, I, p. 82, 25 f. On the use of kardia for koilia, gaster, stomachos, cf. F. Bechtel in Apophoreton von der Graeca Halensis, Berlin, 1903, p. 67 ff. 157 Cf. SMA, pp. v13, I f., 45, I38 f. All depends, of course, on the definition of the term "Gnostic." If we take it-as I personally think we should-in its wider sense as defined by H. Puech in a brilliant recent paper (Eranos-Jahrbuch I951, esp. pp. 77-79; cf. also K. Kerenyi, Mythologie und Gnosis, 1942) it certainly includes everything typical for these amuletic gems. That some, although few, stones are most definitely "relics of Gnosticism" has been admitted by Bonner (SMA, p. I35 f., D I88 and Commem. studies in honor of Th. L. Shear [= Hesperia, Suppl. VIII], pp. 43-46; cf. also SMA, D 235 and p. 325 [Addenda to pp. 133-134]. Bonner's statement that "the influence of magical ideas upon decadent Gnosticism . . . is more im- portant than the influence of Gnostic theology upon ordinary magical practice" (SMA, p. I39; cf. similarly p. 203) seems to me un- acceptable. As far as one can speak of magical "Ideas" at all they appear derived from perverted religion, i.e., from "Gnosis" in its wider sense. See also the following note. s158 In this respect Bonner might be unduly influenced by Pieper (op. cit., see above, note I o). Pieper rightly stressed the prac- tical amuletic character of these gems. But this should not make us overlook the under-</page><page sequence="42">228 A. A. BARB lying Weltanschauung. Pieper finds that neither the manufacturers nor the users of these gems "took part in the developed Hermetic and Gnostic doctrines." But see what is mentioned above, note I57, about unequivocal Gnostic doctrine. As regards Hermetism it might be pointed out that the British Museum stone No. 56489 (= SMA, D 274) shows a verbal quotation from Poi- mandres! Furthermore we must take into account that, as A. Dietrich has pointed out already (Abraxas, p. 2; of. also H. Lietzmann in Forschungen und Fortschritte 933, p. I54), Magic is nothing else but "the people's Gnosis." Theoretical and popular Gnosis, however different, are still both Gnosis, just as dogmatical and practical Kabbalah-the first with its lofty speculations, the latter with its formulae and amulets-are both Kabbalah (cf., e.g., E. Borowski in Genava, XXII, 1944, p. 196). There is a certain tendency to-day, not least among psychoanalysts and their followers, to glorify gnosticism, which in many respects seems very congenial to modern psychoanalysis. But (apart from or- thodox Christian dogmatics) other views are not wanting: J. Bataille wrote about "le bas materialisme et la gnose" (Documents, II, Paris, 1930, p. I ff.), H. J. Schoeps speaks of "gnostischer Nihilismus" (Aus friihchristlicher Zeit, Tibingen, 1950, pp. 255 ff.), and H. Ch. Puech (Eranos-Jahrbuch, I951, p. 85) feels that "la revolte gnostique contre le monde est, de fait, une revolte contre la science grecque." 159 See above, p. 196 (and note 56). 16xe0 Cf. mainly the 4th book of the Opus para- mirum ("De matrice": Paracelsus, Sdmtliche Werke, ed.

Ch. de Tolnay, The drawings of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, 1952, fig. 53) symbolize sloth ("desidia"). What symbolic value (if any) the three snails (with bird) express on a Roman mosaic (cf. Th. Ashby in Papers of the British School at Rome, VII, 1914, pl. II) I cannot tell; they adorned a sepulchral monument and some symbolism is not unlikely. In alchemistic language the snail is supposed to appear as a "symbol of resurrection" (cf. E. Castelli, Il demoniaco nell'arte, Milan-Florence, 1952, Indice, s.v.), perhaps in conformity with mediaeval Chris- tian usage, see below, note 203. 172 Otto Keller, Die antike Tierwelt, II, 1913, p. 523. 173 Soranus, Gynaecia, ed.

In a letter by the Spaniard Enrique de Villena (1411) mentioning "shells" as amulets, the scribe interpolated "of the sea" to avoid this ambi- guity (cf. W. L. Hildburgh, "Cowrie shells as amulets in Europe," Folk-Lore, LIII, 1942, p. 192 f.). However there exist some real con- nexions of the ordinary snail with sexual magic. The ancients appreciated snails as aphrodisiac food (Keller, Die antike Tierwelt, II, p. 519) and Hildburgh, op. cit., p. I88 f., gives interesting references about the use of snails' opercula as popular sexual or fertility amulets and medicines. (But cf. Zeitschrift des Vereinsfiir Volkskunde, XXV, 1915, p. 88 f., for the maritime origin of at least part of these opercula.) Unlike the English "snail" the German word Schnecke is used for both snails and conchs (Cowrie = Porzellan-Schnecke, Eier-Schnecke, etc.), a fact responsible for some inaccuracies in recent folkloristic litera- ture, e.g., Meisen in Rheinisches Jahrbuch fdr Volkskunde, I, I950, p. I51, note 65. In the same periodical, however, II, 1951, p. i i8 ff., L. Schmidt ("Die Schneckenmaskierung") has assembled interesting evidence for the common snail having been used since early prehistoric times as apparently magic body- ornament in some kinds of fertility rituals; of particular interest seems the parallel use of snail-shells and egg-shells (loc. cit., p. I43 ff.). A paper in the periodical Anthropo- phyteia, VI, Leipzig, 1909, pp. 35-50 (Dr. Aigremont: "Muschel und Schnecke als Symbole der Vulva ehemals und jetzt") has been inaccessible to mie. But the possibility must be taken into account that in countries remote from the sea popular custom and belief replaced the foreign sea-shells by their nearest equivalent, the land-snail. The "snail" on a Mithras relief in Spalato repre- sents (see above, note 81x) a sea-shell. 183 R.

(see below, note 195), p. 406, where further references can be found. After having submitted this paper for printing I came across the book by M. Eliade, Images et symboles, Paris, 1952, whose "Remarques sur le symbolisme des coquillages" (ch. 4, p. 164 ff.) bring some useful additional references. The same applies to a paper by E. G. Gobert, "Le pudendum magique et le problkme des cauris," Revue africaine, XCV, I951, pp. 5-62. 18 The similarity with an eye was, if ob- served at all, of secondary importance and by no means essential for its use against the "evil eye"; the phallus, used the same way, has no similarity whatsoever with an eye. But it might be possible that the indented opening of the cowry (and other shells) has something to do with the curious belief of the "vagina dentata" (cf. Funk and Wagnall's Standard dictionary of folk-lore, II, I950, p. 1152, and Verrier Elwin, Myths of Middle India, London, 1949, PP. 354-387, 407-409. 185 Briffault, op. cit., p. 275. 1s8 Keller, op. cit., p. 543.

Incidentally Rubens, too, painted the same subject-in- cluding the conch (Sanssouci, Potsdam); but it does not appear that he saw any connexion between Venus' shell and the snail-hypothesis of M. Chaduc (see above, p. 196 f.). 195 Cf. for the following subject W. D6onna's comprehensive paper "Aphrodite a la co- quille," Revue archdologique, 5e srie, T. VI, 1917, p. 392 ff.

The learned discussions on the subject by L. Stephani in Compte rendu de la commission archdologique pour les annies i870- 1871, St. Petersburg, I874, p. II ff., 55 if., I34 ff., 282 f., however obsolete, should still be used for their references. 196 B i r t h is quite unquestionably repre- sented on some of the monuments, cf. Stephani, op. cit., p. 51i; Deonna, op. cit., p. 400 f.; H. Usener, Vortrdge und Aufsdtze (1907), p. 223 f. For the "birth" of "the first woman" from a cowry shell cf. the anthropo- logical parallels from the Pacific, given by Jackson, op. cit. (below, note 206), pp. 65-67. 197 As a vehicle drawn by dolphins the conch (genus Cardium) appears also in Raphael's Galatea (Villa Farnesina), a painting ob- viously based on Philostratus, Imagines, II, x8; but the ancient author does not mention a conch as vehicle. 198 In ancient literature we do not hear of a "sea-womb" but, what comes very near to such a conception, of animals called "sea- navel" (umbilicus [marinus]-cf. above, notes 104 and 105 for umbilicus - uterus). These umbilici, mentioned together with but distinct from the conchae, cannot be anything but echinids (sea-urchins, sea-eggs). Cf. also below, note 205. 199 See above, p. 197 if. 200 The traditional attitude of the Anadyo- mene, lifting with both hands her hair, has appropriately been called by Deonna (op. cit., p. 396) "un geste ficond." It is the common gesture for Aphrodite on most of the "gnostic" gems, e.g., also on the haematite mentioned above, note 8o, and SMA, D 55; other un- published examples are to be found in the collections of Vienna, London and Paris. Cf. P1. 32b, after an unpublished lapis lazuli gem in the Cabinet des Medailles. A similar stone, published by E. Drioton (Annales du Service des Antiquites d'Egypte, 45, 1947, p. 82 f.) invokes this Anadyomene-type as "Hathor." The gesture might be connected with the (sexual?) significance of the hair mentioned above, note 99. For the hair as the seat of vitality see also L. Sommer, Das Haar in Religion und Aberglauben der Griechen, 1912 (Dissert. Miinster i. W.). Modern psycho- analysis, of course, has a lot to say about hair and sexuality, cf. Charles Berg, The uncon- scious significance of hair, London, 1951. 201 Kerenyi, op. cit. (cf. above, note 8o), p. 76. One is reminded of the Babylonian Creation Epos (Enuma Elis), I, 5 (Apsu and Tiamat commingling their waters as a single body) and of parallels in Jewish tradition mentioned by R. Patai, Man and Temple, 1947, p. 62 ff. Cf. also below, note 230o. 202 See above, p. 198, and notes 75 and 230. 203 An excellent example for the astonishing virtuosity with which old myths were twisted to represent esoteric allegories has been given by F. Cumont, Recherches sur le symbolisme funeraire des Romains, 1 942, p. 20 f.: the saucy story of the misconduct between Mars and Venus is turned on sepulchral monuments into an edifying symbol of the imprisonment of the soul in matter, ending only with death. Under such circumstances we are most cer- tainly entitled to interpret representations of Venus in the Shell rising from the Sea on early Christian objects (e.g., the Projecta- Casket and the silver patera of the Esquiline treasure, Cabrol-Leclerq, Dict. d'arche'ol. chrgt., X, 1916 ff., fig. 7655 and XIV, 1896 ff., fig. 10568) as the Christian soul or the Church born or re-born in baptism; cf. above, note 170. It seems an odd coincidence that on the other hand Gombrich, op. cit. (see above, note 194), P. 55, finds that in Botticelli's 'Birth of Venus' the compositional scheme of the traditional group of the Baptism of Christ (and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost) was taken over from religious art!

DNonna, op. cit., pp. 407 and 415; Cabrol-Leclercq, Dictionnaire d'archiologie chre'- tienne, s.v. "Coquillages" and "Limagon." Dr. C. H. Talbot very kindly draws my atten- tion to a passage on the Assumption of the Virgin Mary by John Godard (ist abbot of Newenham, d. 1250) in MS. Camb. Univ. Libr. Mm. VI. 4, fol. I I3v: "Conchilia num- quam deserunt conchas quocumque se di- vertunt, in quibus indita sibi natura mira- biliter operante coaluerunt et concreta sunt; ac per hoc recte rationis arguit suadela te suam concham corporalem et virginalem sue humanationis secum in gloriam assumpsisse." 204 For good examples see A. Rumpf, Die Meerwesen auf den antiken Sarkophagreliefs (Ant. Sarkophagreliefs, V, I, I939), p. 23 ff. (Nos. 67-90). 205 Cf. Deonna, op. cit., p. 406 f.; Bratsch- kova, Bull. d'inst. arch. bulgare, loc. cit., pp. 5-7 and p. 68 (Cat. No. Ii); M. Much, Mitteil. d. anthropol. Ges. Wien, XXVII, 1897, Sitzungs- ber, p. 44 f. Instead of (or even together with) sea-shells one finds sometimes in pre- historic and later tombs fossil echinids (sea- urchins, "sea-wombs," cf. above, note 198), see O. Abel, "Vorzeitliche Seeigel in Mythus, Brauchtum und Volksglauben," Nachrichten v. d. Gesellsch. d. Wiss. zu Gattingen, Fachgr. Religionswissenschaft, I, 3, 1939, p. 67 ff.; other references see Folk-lore, LXIV, 1953, p. 274 (L. V. Grinsell). This fact is so much more remarkable as these fossil sea-urchins, usually identified with the "Serpents' egg" of Pliny (see below, note 233) were called in old Czechoslovak folk-lore "Soul-Stones" (Abel, op. cit., p. 6I iff.). It may seem fan- tastic to connect these "Soul-Stones" with the roundish and similarly ornamented "Soul-Stones" treasured (and believed to be the embodiment of the deceased an- cestors) by the Australian aborigines (cf. G. Buschan, Illustrierte Volkerkunde, II / I, 1923, p. 31 and p. 19, fig. io/6), but there are striking similarities, not only between the old Czechoslovak and Australian soul fetishes but also with the African placenta beliefs (see literature above, notes 114 and I 15); for a connexion between soul and placenta in Australia cf also Hasting's Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, II, p. 247 b. 206 J. Wilfrid Jackson, Shells as evidence of the migrations of early culture, Manchester, 1917, pp. I85 ft. and passim (see Index, s.v. "Death"). Cf. now also M. Eliade, op. cit. (see above, note 183), pp. 182, I88, etc. 207 For a typical and conclusive example see M.-E. Marien, "Le symbolisme funeraire de la Coquille de Cortilnoirmont," Bulletin des musees royaux d'art et d'histoire (Bruxelles), s6r. 3, XVI, 1944, pp. I113-120, although I disagree with some minor details of his interpretation (there is no question of a voyage to the Island of the Blessed; the vessel held by the griffin does not contain the ashes of the dead but is the container of the "Water of Life," familiar from countless similar representations). o208 Evang. Joh. iii. 3 f 209 De legibus, II, 22: "Redditur enim terrae corpus et ita locatum ac situm quasi operimento matris obducitur." 210 Cf. Ebert, Reallexikon der Vorgeschichte, IV, p. 454, and V, p. 335(b). The explanation of the position as fettering (to prevent the return of the dead) seems to me a secondary development. 211 Ebert, op. cit., IV/2, p. 478 and pl. 236c; J. Przyluski in Eranos-Jahrbuch 1938, Ziurich, I939, p. I4, n. 3. About the "Mother-Pot" cf. also G. Elliot Smith, The Evolution of the Dragon, Manchester, I919, p. 178 ff.; C. G. Jung, Psychologie und Alchemie, p. 325, etc.; idem, Symbole der Wandlung, p. 340 and Index, s.v. "Gefiss," "Uterus." See also the "Vessel" of Isis, above, p. 201 and note I29, and the Amphora-symbol, below, note 215. 212 Cf. H. Frankfort, "Ishtar at Troy," Journal of Near Eastern Studies, VIII, I949, p. 194 ff. It would be a welcome confirma- tion of these ideas to refer to the Etruscan ossuary from Chianciano in form of the en- throned mother-goddess, "Mater Matuta" according to Jung, op. cit., p. 602 and fig. 232; unfortunately there is for the time being no proof that P. Ducati, Storia dell'arte etrusca, 1927, pl. 138, No. 356 and Text p. 32o, is wrong in taking this and similar monuments for portraits of the deceased. 213 I. Lublinski, "Der Mythos von der Ge- burt," Zeitschrift far Ethnologie, LXIV, 1932, p. I 12 ff. The usefulness of this interesting paper is, however, much reduced by faulty and insufficient references. Cf. also E. Baum- gartel, "Tomb and Fertility," Jahrbuch far kleinasiatische Forschung, I, 1950, p. 56 iff.; L. V. Grinsell in Folk-Lore, LXIV, 1953, p. 271 f. 214 In fine art this "Neptunist" Olympus (if we may be pardoned the geological term and the contradictio in adiecto) was established al- ready by Skopas (cf. Pliny, N.H., XXXVI,</page><page sequence="48">232 A. A. BARB 26). It can best be studied on sarcophagi (cf. Rumpf, op. cit. [above, note 204]), and on the mosaics of the Roman empire. The explanation of these subjects on sepulchral monuments with an assumed sea voyage to the Isles of the Blessed (see also above, note 207) has rightly been abandoned, cf. Rumpf, op. cit., p. I31 f., R. Herbig, Die jiingeretruskischen Steinsarkophage, 1952, p. 107; still less convincing seem the more "trivial" explanations mentioned by Herbig, loc. cit. We have to see in the Sea the "Other World" kat'exochin, where, according to "common opinion" (cf. Pliny, N.H., IX, 2), "anything born in any department of nature exists also" -vulgi opinio quidquid nascatur in parte naturae ulla et in mari esse-(I am quoting the transla- tion by R. Rackham in the Loeb Classical Library), besides many things not to be found in "This World." With this "common opinion" in mind we might perhaps reach a better understanding of the sepulchral monu- ments as well as of certain literary utterings, dealt with by L. Radermacher, "Das Meer und die Toten," Anzeiger der Wiener Akademie der Wissensch., 86, 1949, p. 307 ff. J. Fonten- rose (Semitic and oriental studies presented to William Popper = --Univ. of Calif. publ. in semitic philol. XI, I951I) finds (p. 145) that "in seaside cities the descent into the earth was replaced by a descent into the sea." 215s The "source" (spring, well) too is a symbol of the (primeval) womb (cf. the Egyptian hieroglyph, Gardiner, op. cit., Sign- List No. N/41) and consequently for the mother-goddess (see R. Eisler, Philologus, LXVIII, 1909, p. 200 ff. and p. 209). We find the Greek word pigi used for Hera, Magna Mater and the Virgin Mary (cf. E. Bratke, Das sog. Religionsgesprdch am Hof der Sassaniden, Leipzig, 1899, see Index, pp. 294 and 305). This is the other, the positive side of the ambivalent Womb-Archetype (cf. also my paper "Noreia and Rehtia" [see above, note io6], p. 168 ff.); the "Womb" appears simultaneously as the dark "Abyss of Death" (see above, p. 198) and as the bright "Fountain of Life." Classical and later art presents this Pegi-Symbol (cf. also Syria, XXIX, 1952, p. 275 ff.) as a vessel, usually of the amphora type and flanked by two animals (could this composition be somehow con- nected with the anthropomorphic representa- tion of the same principle as Mitr Thiri;n?). I cannot refrain from quoting here the words of one of the great modern artists (Auguste Rodin, L'Art. Entretiens re'unis par Paul Gsell, Paris, I912, p. I55) about the female body as vessel: "D'autre fois encore c'est une u r n e. J'ai souvent fait asseoir par terre un module en lui demandant de tourner le dos de mon cot6, jambes et bras ramen6s en avant. Dans cette position, la silhouette du dos qui s'amincit a la taille et s'l61argit aux hanches apparait seule, et cela figure un vase au galbe exquis, l'a m p h o r e qui contient dans ses flancs la vie de l'avenir." See also above, note 2x11. Here the grasp of the modern sculptor coincides in a startling way with that of his neolithic colleagues some four thousand years before him: cf., e.g., M. Hoernes-O. Menghin, Urgeschichte der bildenden Kunst in Europa, 3rd ed., I1925, p. 319, fig. Ia (our P1. 32c), or the anthropomorphic vase of Vidra, Illust. London News, June 23, 1934, p. 1029, figs. 15-16 (= V. Dumitrescu, L'Art prehist. en Roumanie, Bucharest, I937, pl. V. 216xe Cf. above, note 80. 217 See above, p. 200 and notes 108-o109. 218 That the shell in graves and on tomb- stones symbolizes rebirth has been seen al- ready by H. C. Coote, "The symbolism of the scallop shell," Archaeologia, XLII, 1869, p. 322 ff., and by L. Stephani, Compte rendu . .. , 1870-71, p. I34 ff. Cf. also E. Strong, Journal of Roman Studies, IV, 1914, p. I49. O. Keller, Die antike Tierwelt, II, p. 560, is most definitely mistaken when he writes: "Von Auferstehungssymbolik... kann nicht die Rede sein." M. Bratschkova, op. cit., does not even mention the possibility of such a symbolism. 219 A good example is the sepulchral relief of L. Antistius Sarculo and his wife in the British Museum, published by E. Strong, loc. cit., pl. XXIV, here reproduced P1. 32a. 220 Cf. Bratschkova, op. cit., p. 14 ff- 221 Varro, De lingua latina, VII, 7, quotes two verses by Naevius who calls the sky "a blue conch": hemispherium ubi conc(h)a caerulea saeptum stat; K. O. Mueller's far-fetched emendation [1833!] should not have been taken over in the Loeb edition. The conch sometimes replaces the nimbus, not only on Christian monuments (Bratschkova, op. cit., p. 63) but already on Roman reliefs of the Thracian Rider-Hero (cf. Jahreshefte des 6sterr. arch. Instit., XXXII, 1940, Beibl. 102, fig. 33). 222 Cf. above, p. 198, and notes 73-74. 223 Cf. above, p. 199, and note 87. 224 "Lumaca," so Ed(vard) L(ehmann), s.v. "Cosmogonia" in the Enciclopedia Italiana, XI, p. 582. But see the following note. 225 P. Hambruch, Nauru, Halbband I, 1914,</page><page sequence="49">DIVA MATRIX 233 p. 38I f. (= Hamburg. wissensch. Stiftung. Er- gebnisse der Siidsee-Expedition 90o8-X9g0o, II/B, i). Actually these "snails" (Schnecken) again turn out not to be Landschnecken (see above, note I82) but Meeresschnecken, of the species tritonium. As, however, the demiurg "Old Spider" takes the animals out of their shell before applying them to the splitting open of the tridacna shell they appear practically as slugs. For snail and/or conch shells representing the Moon (and Sun) in India as well as Mexico cf. Jackson, op. cit., pp. 52- 56. In a Polynesian cosmogony the Octopus (and his sister!) seem to replace the two "snails" in the task of separating Heaven from Earth, cf. A. Bastian, Die heilige Sage der Poly- nesier, i1881, p. 107. 228 F. Boll, Sphaera, Leipzig, 1903, p. 465, 1. i9; cf. ibid., p. 468 and plates I and V. 227 For the "She-Bear" as mother-goddess cf. also my paper "Noreia und Rehtia" (see above, note io6), p. 170 f., n. 85. 228 Gundel's doubts regarding the interpre- tation of Helike as "snail" (Roscher, Lexikon der Mythologie, VI, col. 874/29 ff.) are as a typical argumentum ex silentio inconclusive. 229 Cf. p. 204, and note I73. 230 F. Lukas, Die Grundbegriffe in den Kosmo- gonien der alten Velker, Leipzig, 1893, p. 251 f. and passim (see Index, p. 270, s.v. "Ei"); idem, "Das Ei als kosmogonische Vorstel- lung," Zeitschrift des Vereins fiir Volkskunde, Ber- lin, IV, I894, p. 227 ff. Important material on the cosmogonic egg in old Egyptian myth- ology is presented by S. Morenz ("Aegypten und die altorphische Kosmogonie") in Aus Antike und Orient, Festschrift for Wilhelm Schu- bart, Leipzig, 1950, p. 71 ff. The interesting mythologem of the impregnation of the Egg (== Abyssos-Chaos) by the Wind (cf. above, note 75) gains further importance through the observation that in Egyptian language (on the important r6le of punning in the creation of mythologems see Morenz, loc. cit., p. 97 f.) "Egg" appears as the feminine form of "Wind" (loc. cit., p. 99) and so the god Amun who personifies the Wind ultimately impreg- nates himself-just like Kronos-Thalassa, see above, p. 205 and note 201. 231 While the Greek Aphrodite is born from a Sea-Shell the Syrian Aphrodite appears born from an Egg, cf. Deonna, op. cit., p. 397. For the occurrence of eggs in tombs, very similar to that of sea-shells cf. M. P. Nilsson, Opuscula selecta, I, I951, p. 3 ft. ("Das Ei im Totenkult der Alten"). See also above, note 182 about egg shells replacing snail shells. 232 See also above, note 150. Heracles is called Drakon heliktds (0. Kern, Orphicorum fragmenta, p. 138, No. 58) and Helios, ac- claimed as the "creator of the universe," is said to "coil round (upLe)Laaov) the great pole" (Preisendanz, Pap. Graec. Mag., pap. IV, 438 and 1959). 233 Kern, op. cit., p. 137, No. 57. The "Serpents' Egg" of Celtic mythology (Pliny, N.H., XXIX, 52 ff.), ovum urinum (uranium?) might be the residue of a similar mythologem. 234 Reproduced, e.g., in this Journal, XI, I948, pl. 2Ib. For the "Light"-producing primeval Egg cf. also Philo Byblius (or rather Sanchuniaton) as quoted by Eusebius, Prae- par. Evang., I, 10o, 2, and our Pls. 31g, 33c. 235 The symbolic value of the so-called omphalos-bowls has not been touched in the otherwise very useful Munich thesis by H. Luschey, Die Phiale, Bleicherode a. H. I939; Luschey also omitted mentioning the in- numerable omphalos bowls from Hallstatt and La-Tene tombs in Central Europe. Leise- gang, op. cit. [see the following note], p. 227, is most certainly right in stressing the cosmic symbolism of the omphalos-bowls. This might also help to explain the omphalos-bowl (patera umbilicata) held in the hand of the deceased, cf. A. Rumpf, Katalog der etrusk. Skulpturen (Staatl. Museen zu Berlin), pl. 28, E 38 and 40; pl. 32, E 42 and 44, and the omphalos- bowl symbol on tombstones (see below, note 295). 238 R. Delbrueck and W. Vollgraff, "An Orphic bowl," Journal of Hellenic Studies, LIV, 1934, p. 129 ff. H. Leisegang, "Das Mys- terium der Schlange," Eranos-Jahrbuch 1939, Zirich, 1940, p. 151 ff. 3 J. Schwabe (op. cit., p. 231) gives a Chinese example for the interchangeability of serpent and snail; he also notes the common root of English "snake" and German "Schnecke" (== snail--cf. F. Kluge and A. Gotze, Etymologisches Worterbuch, I5th ed., 1951, p. 685). There is perhaps a connexion between the Micronesian myth of the two cosmogonic snails and the Mexican story of two serpents who create heaven and earth by breaking the evil toad-shaped mother-goddess in two: cf. F. A. Thevet, La cosmographie uni- verselle illustre'e, Paris, 1575, II, p. 443 f., as quoted by J. Schwabe, op. cit., p. 234 f. See also the story from the island Tomman near Malekula (Schwabe, pp. 234 and 443 f.) where the gigantic primeval womb shaped as tridacna shell is killed by inserting a stick "wound round with two kinds of string in 5</page><page sequence="50">234 A. A. BARB opposite directions"; Layard (Eranos Jahrbuch 1948, p. 245) compares this stick to the caduceus of Hermes with two serpents. Schwabe, pp. 2 17-294, assembles an impres- sive amount of material for the two cosmo- gonic serpents (male and female, sun and moon). 238 Cf. Aristotle, Hist. animalium, IV, 4, 1. 239 It is most interesting to compare what L. Schmidt, op. cit. (see above, note 182), p. 158 f., observes about the decisive impor- tance of the spiral form for the uterus- symbolism of the snail. 240 See above, p. igg99 ff. and Pls. 27-29. 241 Smith, op. cit. (see above, note 211), pp. 176 and 177. 242 See G. Wilke in Ebert, Reallexikon der Vorgeschichte, IV/2, p. 494, and plate 237 A/a (Wilke sees in the double spiral "an abbre- viation of the snail and as such a symbol of the moon"-cf. the Micronesian Moon-snail mentioned above!). This spiral motive was of astonishing longevity on tombstones, as can be seen on the Bulgarian example of the 3rd cent. A.D., reproduced on our P1. 32e and on certain mediaeval tombstones ("stetchak," ca. 1400 A.D. ?!) from Yugoslavia, reproduced by A. Benac, Olovo, Belgrade, 1951, plates 1-5, 7-12, etc. (particularly interesting plate I6). As regards the complex and far-reaching con- nexions of the symbolism of the Spiral with that of the Labyrinth I must here confine myself to mentioning K. Kerinyi, Labyrinth- studien, 2nd ed., Zurich, 195o (= Albae Vigilae, N.F.X), esp. p. 57 ff.; idem ("Laby- rinthos") in Laureae Aquincenses memoriae V. Kuzsinsky dicatae, II, Budapest, 1941, p. 3 ff. M3 For the following cf. also Donald A. Mackenzie, The migration of symbols, London, 1926, pp. 47-138 ("The Spiral"). 24 See above, note g91. Cf. also Gardiner, op. cit., Sign List F/45; Smith, op. cit., p. 191, fig. b. This sign seems to me to under- lie the idols dealt with by Frankfort, "Ishtar in Troy" (see above, note 212) just as well as the two tufts of hair on "Baubo"-repre- sentations as shown in Th. Wiegand and H. Schrader, Priene, 1904, p. 16I, figs. 150- I51, I53-I54; these terra-cottas would so amalgamate the double-spiral-symbol, the belly-symbol (cf. above, note 128 and Ch. Picard, Eranos-Jahrbuch 1939 [1940], p. io6), and, in a way, the hair-symbol. 25 See above, note 99, and note 2o00. The Greek word helix has been used for hair- curls too. Cf. also G. Kaschnitz-Wein- berg ("Zur Herkunft der Spirale in der Aegais"), Praehistorische Zeitschrift, XXXIV/ V, I949/50, p. 2 10, about the spiral orna- ment representing hair "als Sitz der Lebens- kraft." See also R. B. Onians, The Origins of European Thought, 1951, p. 13o f., 231 ff., and J. H.

For the Lotus as womb-symbol see above, note 128. 251 In Greek "Helix" is used not only for the tendrils of vine or ivy but also as a name for ivy as such (cf. "Hedera Helix"). On the vine and ivy rinceau and their fertility symbolism cf. now W. Deonna in Les cahiers techniques de l'art, II, 3, 1952. Goethe in his study "Ueber die Spiraltendenz der Vegetation" (Works, Cotta's edition of 1867, Vol. XXXII) speaks of the "Spiraltendenz als Grundgesetz des Lebens" (ed. cit., p. 153) and sees (e.g., ed. cit., p. 171) in the spiral the female element in contrast to the straight male part. 252 W.

Frankfort, "Ishtar at Troy" (see above, note 212). 253 The derivation of the volutes of the Ionic capital from the palm-tree is far better documented and more convincing than Andrae's theory. Cf. F. von Luschan, Entste- hung und Herkunft der Jonischen Saule, Leipzig, 1912 (= Der Alte Orient, XIII/4); E. and R. Wurz, Die Entstehung der Saulenbasen des Altertums, Heidelberg, 1925 (= Zeitschr. f Gesch. der Architektur, Beih. I5). I do not think that there is sufficient evidence to try a derivation from the Babylonian Womb- Symbol and to see in the Ionic column a kind of Yoni-Lingam symbol, although there is some similarity between the Ionic capital and representations like our Pl. 27f-h. 254 Plato, Timaeus, 39a (cf.

Aus der Analyse von Trdumen und Einfallen kam ich wiederholt in die Lage, das Medusenhaupt als schreckhaftes Symbol der weiblichen Genitalgegend zu deuten, dessen Einzelheiten 'von unten nach oben' verlegt wurden. Die vielen Schlangen, die sich urns Haupt ringeln, diirften-durch das Gegenteil dar- gestellt-das Vermissen des Penis andeuten und das Grauen selbst den furchtbaren Eindruck wieder- hglen, den das penislose (kastrierte) Genitale aufdas Kind machte. Die angstvoll und dngstigend vor- quellenden Augen des Medusenhauptes haben auch die Nebenbedeutung der Erektion." 263 Internat.

"zu vertreten, miisste man der Genese dieses isolierten Symbols des Grauens in der Mytho- logie der Griechen und seinen Parallelen in anderen Mythologien nachgehen." Freud, loc. cit., p. 48. 265 Cf., e.g., C. Berg, op. cit. (see above, note 200oo), p. 78: "The Gorgon's head clearly shows us that hair equals snakes equals phallus." 266 The familiar story tells us how Perseus first has to pass the three Graiae (I'pptL) and to rob them of the s i n g 1 e eye which they guard in common, to find (and kill) the Gorgo. Now ypertc denotes (among other things) "the folds of skin below the navel" (cf. Lidell-Scott-Jones, Greek-Engl. Lexicon, s.v. ypMTM) and their single common eye might be the navel (omphalos)-leading to the Gorgo = mitra. If this is a coincidence, it is certainly a remarkable one. 267J.

An argument in favour of his theory, not used by him as far as I can see, is to be found in Etruscan imagery, where the Gor- gon's Head (but also other heads similarly used on sepulchral monuments) is combined with the Omega-shaped "Hairdress" of Hathor; cf. our Pl. 33a, b, and E.

A. BARB (Kumba) = "womb" (above, notes 9go and 135). Perhaps it should be mentioned here (much as I personally distrust these specula- tions), that according to Eisler, Weltenmantel und Himmelszelt, p. 524, n. 4 in Greek Kephale (= head) and Kybele are isopsephic (see above, note 89). 277 See now K.

Preisendanz neglects Delatte's identification Akephalos = Bes for his less obvious one Akephalos = Osiris; but the latter equation is, I think, the secondary re- sult of a preceding (Akephalos-)Bes = Kronos (-"Thalassa," see above, p. 198). For mediaeval "stethocephalic" representations of "Acephali" see R.

(Leisegang, loc. cit., plates I I-14). 303 The very name Gorgo means "the roar- ing," cf. Roscher's Mythol. Lexikon, s.v. "Gorgo," col. 1633. 304 The simple truth that one cannot cast out other devils by Beelzebub, if sadly missed by the Pharisees, was never ignored, as far as I can see, by the manufacturers of amulets. It is always some representant of Light: Heracles, Perseus, Horus, Solomon, one of the Archangels (especially Michael), or some Saint (Sisinnios), who provide the helpful force on the amulets against the powers of Darkness. Whenever an evil power is repre- sented without this counterbalance of the "Saviour," this portrait could-in the sense pointed out above-provide protection solely against the portrayed evil itself. 305 Testamentum Salomonis, c.

According to some scholars the earliest type of the Gorgoneion appears to be derived from the (Hittite?) lions' heads, cf. M. P. Nilsson, Geschichte der griechischen Religion, I, 1941, p. 211. 313 Hystera too hisses like a snake and (on one amulet at least) is said to roar like a deer.

It originally denoted the iron ore Haematite, further the chemically closely related Magnetite (cf. French aimant =- magnet from adamant) and the newly dis- covered iron (or steel), primarily produced from these two ores. The hardness of the new metal led the Greek to the wrong etymology adamas = the "unconquerable" (from dama3 = to conquer). 322Jung and Ker6nyi, op. cit.

ADDENDA P. 205, second paragraph: we can add to the Egyptian, Graeco-Roman and Archaic-Greek mother goddesses with womb-symbols a Far Eastern parallel. A neolithic figure published by K. Singer ("Cowrie and Baubo in Early Japan"), Man, XL, I940, pp. 50 ff., fig. I, shows a cowrie shell in the suggestive position. P. 220, note 85: TAAATO could however be a "scribal error" for TAMTH (?) = Tiamat (or tamtu = ocean), cf. A. Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis, 2nd ed., Chicago, 1951, pp. 77 and 98 f. P. 224, notes I 17 and I20: the vessel carried by the priest on the relief in Rome (now in the Vatican collections, cf. W. Amelung, Die Skulpturen des Vatikanischen Museums, II, P1. VII/55 and pp. 142 ff.) clearly shows the uterus-shape and serpent-handle. A strange pot of exactly the same form and with a coiled serpent as handle, found in Hadra (Egypt) and published by A. Adriani (Annuaire du musde greco-romain, Alexandria, III, 1952, p. 21 and pl. XII/1-3) is adorned with a small relief representing the head of Athena. But this head is turned upside down, so that the Hadra vessel was clearly intended to be looked at with the opening down- wards-i.e. in the same position as the uterus-pictures on the engraved stones and in the medical books. For the "head of Athena" obviously meaning Hathor-Isis, cf. Preisendanz, Pap. Graec. Mag., II, p. 29 (pap. VII, 644 f.) and the references given by H. P. L'Orange in Symbolae Osloenses, XXI, 1941, p.
