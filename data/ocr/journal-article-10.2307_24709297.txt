Christian moderates of an intellectual bent and even some agnostics and atheists have taken umbrage and lashed back. In this paper I defend the New Atheists against three common charges: that their critiques of religion commit basic logical fallacies (such as straw man, false dichotomy, or hasty generalization), that their own atheism is just as "faith-based" as the religious beliefs they criticize, and that their expressed disrespect for religious belief is immoral. Keywords Atheism • Dawkins, Richard • Harris, Sam • Hitchens, Christopher • Irrationality • New Atheism Introduction In the tradition of Christian apologetics, an apology is a defense of a framework of beliefs against criticisms or misunderstandings by those who reject the framework. It is in this sense of 'apology,' not the more colloquial sense of an expression of regret, that I wish to offer an apology for the so-called "New Atheism." I use the term as a convenient name rather than as a definite description. The appellation derives from Gary Wolf's article "The Church of the Non-Believers," from the November 2006 issue of Wired magazine. Wolf reflects critically on four then-recent and prominent atheist polemics: Sam Harris' The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason and Letter to a Christian Nation, Daniel Dennett's Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, and Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion (Wolf 2006).

It is the unapologetic, antireligious zeal of Harris, Dennett, and Dawkins that makes them, in Wolf's eyes, new atheists. Physicist Victor Stenger, now often identified as a leading New Atheist himself, concurs. According to Stenger, the New Atheism says that we shouldn't be treating religion with kid gloves or avoid offending moderate Christians merely because we need their support for various science education battles, such as the fight over evolution being taught in the schools. It says that there are too many evils resulting from religion, requiring that we speak out more forcefully than before. (Grothe 2010) As a number of commentators have pointed out, however, there is nothing essentially new about the "New Atheists." "Old" atheists like Bertrand Russell, H. L. Mencken, Robert Ingersoll, and W. K. Clifford, to mention just a few names, wore no kid gloves; the rhetorical forcefulness of their critiques of the evils of religion and of the rational superiority of disbelief over belief is unmistakable. Perhaps Tom Flynn, the editor of the secular humanist magazine Free Inquiry, had it right when he said that the only thing new about the New Atheists was that, "for the first time, uncompromising athe ist writing was coming from big-name publishers and hitting best-seller lists" (Flynn 2010). Whether or not the New Atheism is significantly new, it has certainly created a stir. Wolf's judgment in November 2006 that the New Atheists have not "hit a nerve" with society, that they are to be tossed in with the "would-be prophets in the world, vainly peddling their provocative claims" (Wolf 2006), now seems premature at best. Despite their heavy subject matter and theological iconoclasm, the books Wolf dismissed all made it onto the New York Times bestseller lists. And they were followed by the publi cation, in 2007, of Victor Stenger's God: The Failed Hypothesis—How Science Shows that God Does Not Exist, which somewhat improbably, given the scientific content of the book and Stenger's comparative obscurity as an author, climbed up onto the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list, and Christopher Hitchens' God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything, which hit the No. 1 spot on the list. No sooner had the New Atheism become a cottage industry, however, than a competing cottage indus try of anti-New-Atheist and predominantly pro-Christian apologetics had sprung up beside it. The writings and public appearances of the New Atheists have rankled people all along the spectrum of religiosity: from religious fundamentalists to religious mod erates to agnostics to, even, other atheists. I will be focusing on charges against the New Atheism leveled by religious moderates and agnostics; objections from religious fundamentalists tend to be question-begging at best, and objections from atheists are much more tactical than substantive. The charges against the New Atheism are legion. It would be a practically impossible undertaking to defend the New Atheism against all of them, and I would not wish to do so even if it were not impractical. Some of the accusations are fair: mischaracterizations, oversimplifications, and sketchy arguments do make their appearances in the New Atheist manifestos. Still, we should bear in mind a point that critics too often overlook: namely, that none of the bestselling New Atheist books were written for an academic audience; that, in all likelihood, some â Springer</page><page sequence="3">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 7 avoidance of complexity and nuance was deliberate. And this means there may be more to be said in defense of some of the New Atheists' key contentions than the New Atheists actually say. The audience-based limitations of the New Atheist treatises aside, some charges against the New Atheism are simply misplaced. The fact that they are being taken seriously is an impediment to sound reasoning about the truth claims of religions and about the actions that follow from acceptance or rejection of these claims. In this paper, I focus on three charges against the New Atheists. They have been leveled frequently, and I believe they go to the heart of some crucial disagreements among theists, atheists, and agnostics: a. The arguments that the New Atheists use to justify their atheism commit elemen tary logical fallacies. Many critics accuse the New Atheists of attacking a straw man. The philosopher Andrew Fiala characterizes the target of the New Athe ists' critiques as a "mythic sky-God ... that has long since been dead" (Fiala 2009, p. 140). The prominent literary critic Terry Eagleton remarks that "[wjhen it comes to the New Testament, at least, what [the New Atheists] usually write off is a worthless caricature of the real thing, rooted in a degree of ignorance and prejudice to match religion's own" (Eagleton 2009, p. xi). The accusation can be heard in less academic circles as well, as illustrated by Deepak Chopra's derision of the New Atheists' God as a "dead white male" and a "straw man" (Chopra 2010). Other critics claim to diagnose a false dichotomy or bifurcation fallacy. Thus the philosopher J. Angelo Corlett has accused Dawkins in particular of "suffering] from the God less delusion of wrongly reasoning that the defeat of orthodox Chris tian theism justifies atheism" (Corlett 2009, p. 126). In the same vein, the noted author Robert Wright contends that the New Atheists have at most discredited "the traditional, anthropomorphic god" (Wright 2009, p. 445). Still others iden tify the New Atheists' target as religious fundamentalism more generally (Reitan 2009; Harris 2008), and point out that the inference from the falsity of religious fundamentalism to the falsity of all varieties of theism is a hasty generalization. b. The atheism of the New Atheists is epistemically just as unwarranted as the funda mentalist theism they criticize. In the words of Christian philosopher Eric Reitan, "[t]heir atheism is a matter of faith, that is, a way of seeing the world that they have chosen from an array of alternatives about which reason and evidence have nothing decisive to say" (Reitan 2009, p. 181). Author and filmmaker Frank Scha effer echoes this thought, while making the point more general: "One thing we can count on: Everyone has faith in something, even if it is faith in having no faith" (Schaeffer 2009, p. 4). According to Georgetown theologian John Haught, "Harris's and Dawkins's own scientism, the intellectual backbone of their sci entific naturalism, is a belief for which there can be no 'sufficient' scientific or empirical 'evidence' either" (Harris 2008, p. 11). But one need not be a theist to view atheism as a leap beyond the evidence. Although not remarking on the New &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="4">8 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 Atheism as such, the agnostic Bible scholar and bestselling author Bart Ehrman expresses a common critical sentiment: I don't know if there is a God. I don't call myself an atheist, because to declare affirmatively that there is no God (the declaration of atheists) takes far more knowledge (and chutzpah) than I have. How would I know if there's a God? I'm just a mortal like everyone else. (Ehrman 2008, p. 125) Since atheists are mortals just like everyone else, isn't their belief in God's non existence unjustified? c. Not only is the New Atheism intellectually flawed, itisimmoral. Fiala refers to Har ris, Dawkins, and Hitchens as "the new breed of militant atheists," characterized by a contemptible "intolerance toward religion" (Fiala 2009, p. 140; emphasis added). Eric Reitan goes so far as to assert that "[w]e see ... hate today in the spewing vitriol of Dawkins, the righteous outrage of Harris, the cold intellectual disdain of Dennett" (Reitan 2009, p. 33; emphasis added). The first two accusations against the New Atheists are logically connected: if the atheism of the New Atheists is based entirely on fallacious reasoning, then it is epi stemically unwarranted. So it makes sense to deal with the accusations in tandem, and this is what I will do. After defending the New Atheism's epistemic credentials, I turn to the third accusation and offer an argument that the New Atheism is morally justified. To make my evaluation of the charges against the New Atheism more manageable, I will take the work of four of the most prominent New Atheists, Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens, and Stenger, as representative.1 An important caveat is in order regarding my project in this paper. It is far from a full-fledged defense of atheism. Such a project would have to engage critically with the classic theistic arguments—for example, of the ontological, cosmological, and design varieties—and that is far more than a single paper can do. My project here is instead a defense of the New Atheism against the specific and common criticisms identified above. Because the critics I consider do not press any of the classic theistic arguments against the New Atheists, none of these arguments is evaluated (in any substantial way) in the paper. Is the New Atheist critique of religion fallacious? Let us begin with the straw-man charge. To commit a straw-man fallacy is to attempt to refute a position by criticizing a weak and distorted version of it. One gets the impression from reading some of the anti-New Atheists that they are working with a 1 Along with Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens, it is the philosopher Daniel Dennett, rather than the physi cist Victor Stenger, who has been admitted to the ranks of the "Four Horsemen of Atheism." 1 choose to include Stenger in my discussion rather than Dennett because Stenger's project in a number of books— including God: The failed hypothesis (2007), Quantum gods: Creation, chaos, and the search for cosmic consciousness (2009), and The New Atheism: Taking a stand for science and reason (2009)—is the defense of atheism, whereas Dennett's New Atheist work, Breaking the spell: Religion as a natural phenomenon, offers a naturalistic account of the appeal and prevalence of religion, rather than, primarily, a debunking of it. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 9 different understanding of the fallacy. Apparently, the New Atheists commit it when they aim to refute a version of theism other than the one the anti-New Atheist subscribes to! Thus we find Eagleton objecting to Dawkins' and Hitchens' "straw-targeting of Christianity" with "vulgar caricatures" (Eagleton 2009, p. 52), since he himself doesn't subscribe to the Christian fundamentalism which is the target of some (but only some) of Dawkins' and Hitchens' criticisms. For the New Atheists to be genuinely guilty of committing a straw-man fallacy with their antitheistic arguments, they would have to be attacking a version of theism to which no one, or at most relatively few people, subscribe. This is not the case. As Sam Harris notes in the preface of his Letter to a Christian Nation, over 50 % of Americans accept "that the Bible is the inspired word of God and that only those who accept the divinity of Jesus Christ will experience salvation after death" (Harris 2008, p. viii). Harris also cites a 2005 poll conducted by CNN, USA Today, and Gallup, according to which a full 53 % of American adults hold that "God created human beings in their present form exactly the way the Bible describes it" (Harris 2008, p. x); thus, over half of American adults reject the theory that lies at the foundation of all the biological sciences: evolution by natural selection. An average of Gallup polls taken in May 2005, May 2006, and May 2007 shows that virtually a third of Americans, 31 %, believe the Bible to be the "actual word of God, to be taken literally" (Newport 2007). Given the prevalence of such religious beliefs, the scorn the New Atheists heap on Christian fundamentalists is hardly heaped on a straw man. But even if there is no straw man to be found in the vicinity of these antifundamen talist criticisms, the New Atheists could, in theory, be guilty of a false dichotomy—a common charge against them. And they would be guilty of a false dichotomy if they argued simply from the falsity of some form of religious fundamentalism to the truth of atheism. Dawkins gives the impression of doing this in the preface to the paperback edition of The God Delusion. Responding to the charge that "You always attack the worst of religion and ignore the best, [i.e.,] sophisticated theologians like Tillich and Bonhoeffer," Dawkins asserts that "[t]he melancholy truth is that this kind of under stated, decent, revisionist religion is numerically negligible" (Dawkins 2008, p. 15). But here Dawkins actually sells himself short. As we will see, the "God hypothesis" that he spends so much time refuting in The God Delusion is not a hypothesis accepted only by fundamentalists but is quite (although not entirely) nonsectarian. And of the New Atheists in general it can be said that, while their most vitriolic denunciations are reserved for the pernicious moral and intellectual tendencies of religious fundamental isms, their overall critique, properly understood, applies to supernaturalistic theisms of all stripes. It does not, however, apply to forms of theism that are not supernaturalistic, such as certain forms of pantheism.2 It is this fact that inoculates the New Atheists against the common criticism, noted above, that the God whose existence the New Atheists disprove is the primitive God of monotheistic fundamentalisms. In Haught's words, it is "the God of creationists, fundamentalists, terrorists, and intelligent design (ID) advocates," rather than the God 2 The question of how to demarcate the natural from the supernatural is a vexed one. For purposes of this paper, 1 simply assume that a distinction between the two exists and that the distinction is consonant with the descriptions of it given by the New Atheists. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">10 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 of "any major theologians" (Harris 2008, p. xv). Because this misplaced criticism is so common, it is worth lingering over. Reitan has written at greater length than perhaps any other critic of the New Atheists on the question of the legitimacy of their definitions of God (Reitan 2009, pp. 14-57). He lambasts Harris for "blithely equaling] religion with fundamentalism" (Reitan 2009, p. 30). He chastises Stenger, who provides a list of eight purported attri butes that God would have if God existed (Stenger 2007, pp. 41^2), for including in his definition properties pertaining to what God does or has done—such as that "God steps in whenever he wishes to change the course of events" and that "God has endowed humans with immaterial, eternal souls" (Stenger 2007, p. 42)—rather than limiting himself to properties that describe what God is. And he upbraids Dawkins for allegedly defining God as "the god of superstition, the dangerous power that, if we believe in it, will inspire subservience rather than devotion" (Reitan 2009, p. 57). In fact, each one of these accusations is unjust. That Harris does not equate religion with fundamentalism should be apparent (and it does seem apparent to Reitan when he is not engaged in rhetorical flourish) from the fact that The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation, in addition to inveigh ing against the immoral and anti-scientific tendencies of religious fundamentalisms, expound a separate argument explicitly directed against religious moderatism, to the effect that it "represents a failure to criticize the unreasonable (and dangerous) cer tainty of others" (Harris 2005, p. 39). If anyone is guilty of equating religion as a whole with a mere part of religion, it is Reitan, who can pay lip-service to the ideal of "[rjespect for religion in all its forms" only because, following Schleiermacher, he denies "authentic religiosity" to any but the practitioners of what he takes to be benign forms of religion (Reitan 2009, p. 29). Reitan's objection to Stenger's list of divine attributes is a semantic quibble rather than a substantive objection. In one sense of the word 'attribute,' an attribute is just a property, and a being's properties include doing such and such or having done such and such. While it is true that not every theist believes in a God that possesses all eight of the properties Stenger enumerates, this is beside the point for purposes of Stenger's argument. For if Stenger's book-length argument in God: The Failed Hypothesis is sound, there exists no supernatural being that exhibits even one of those properties. Given that the list includes such basic properties as being "the creator and preserver of the universe" and being "the architect of the structure of the universe and the author of the laws of nature" (Stenger 2007, p. 41), Stenger's argument can hardly be accused of refuting the existence of a "straw God." Finally, Reitan's critique of Dawkins' "God Hypothesis," namely, the hypothesis that "there exists a superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us" (Dawkins 2006, p. 31), equally misses the mark. Reitan takes Dawkins to task for omitting from his highly ecumenical God Hypothesis any mention of God's goodness, without which a central element of Reitan's own faith, "the ethico-religious hope," the hope that "the uni verse is fundamentally on the side of goodness" (Reitan 2009, p. 49), cannot be justi fied. Reitan claims to be "particularly fond of the summary [of God's nature] offered by atheist philosopher William Rowe ... : 'The dominant idea of God in western civilization ... is the idea of a supremely good being, creator of but separate from â Springer</page><page sequence="7">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 11 and independent of the world, all-powerful (omnipotent), all-knowing (omniscient), eternal, and self-existent'" (Reitan 2009, p. 40). But of course inserting the concept of goodness into Dawkins' God Hypothesis doesn't help matters for Reitan. For if Dawkins succeeds in refuting the existence of a "superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us," he thereby succeeds in refuting the existence of a supremely good "superhuman, super natural intelligence ..This is a straightforward logical truth: if nothing exists that exhibits properties F and G, then, ipso facto, nothing exists that exhibits properties F, G,and H. Atheism and epistemic justification So the straw-man and false dichotomy charges are misplaced. To be dealt with next is the popular contention that the atheism of the New Atheists is just as much a matter of faith as the theism of the most dogmatic fundamentalist. Indeed, it has become fashionable to refer to the New Atheists as "fundamentalist atheists." This clearly pejorative use of 'fundamentalist' cannot mean simply "exhibiting strict adherence to certain fundamental principles," since fundamentalism in that sense can be a positive thing. (One could be, for example, a "fundamentalist altruist.") The idea, rather, must be that, when it comes to their (a)theological beliefs, the New Atheists are just as impervious to evidence as religious fundamentalists. Against this criticism, I argue that the New Atheism is legitimately grounded on the epistemic principle that Antony Flew has called "the presumption of atheism" (Flew 1999), which in turn is based on Ockham's Razor. Understanding the role that Ockham's Razor plays in the thought of the New Atheists is essential for seeing that their atheism is not a matter of blind faith or epistemic overreach. The epistemic principle that has come to be known as Ockham's Razor3 or the Prin ciple of Simplicity instructs us, in the most famous formulation attributed (perhaps falsely) to Ockham (see Ockham 1990, p. xxi), that "entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity."4 But Ockham scholar Sharon Kaye points out that this proposition requires clarification: For Ockham, the principle of simplicity limits the multiplication of hypothe ses not necessarily entities. Favoring the formulation "It is useless to do with more what can be done with less," Ockham implies that theories are meant to do things, namely, explain and predict, and these things can be accomplished more effectively with fewer assumptions. (Kaye 2007) Simplicity is one of a handful of so-called "explanatory virtues." These are most commonly discussed in connection with questions of scientific theory selection but can be seen at work as well in the explanations we construct, often effortlessly, for It should be noted that this—virtually instinctive—epistemic principle was not original to Ockham. We find references to it as early as Ptolemy (Carrier 2010, p. 416). 4 Ockham did use the similar formulation: "Plurality is not to be multiplied beyond necessity" (Ockham 1990, p. xxi). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="8">12 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 everyday phenomena. One theory or explanation is rationally or epistemically supe rior to another when it better exemplifies the explanatory virtues: qualities including, but not limited to, simplicity, explanatory power, and unification of previously dis crete problems by subsumption under a single problem-solving strategy (Lycan 1988, p. 130; Kitcher 1982, p. 48). In the view of the New Atheists (and of atheists in general), God is, to put it bluntly, a superfluous hypothesis. Dawkins, in The God Delusion, makes liberal use of the term 'God Hypothesis,' predictably rankling many theists. They point out that there are many God hypotheses' rather than one—and that even this improved formulation is misleading, as the typical theist does not regard the divine as a coldly intellectual hypothesis. But the New Atheists need not be seen as denying any of this. Their target is the common core of any supernaturalistic theism: acceptance of the proposition that at least one supernatural deity exists. The crucial role that the presumption of atheism, and more fundamentally Ockham's Razor, plays for the New Atheists is to put the burden of proof on the theist and even on the agnostic. Given that the existence of God is neither self-evi dent nor immediately perceived, theists must show that some datum that we know or rationally accept is explained at least as well by the hypothesis that a deity or deities exist as by any competing naturalistic hypothesis. Some critics of the New Atheists misunderstand the sort of evidence or epistemic justification the New Athe ists demand. Eagleton, for example, protests that "we have to put up with something less than certainty, known as faith" (Eagleton 2009, p. 111). But the New Atheists are not demanding certainty. We can never be certain that the best explanation is true; we can know at most that it is better than other explanations we have so far considered. Thus we find even a tenacious atheist like Dawkins abjuring the stance of the "strong atheist," who claims to "know there is no God"; he describes himself instead as a "[d]e facto atheist," someone who affirms that "I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there" (Dawkins 2006, p. 51 ; emphasis added). A core tenet of the New Atheism is that there is nothing the God Hypothesis explains at least as well as an alternative naturalistic hypothesis does. It is not incumbent on the New Atheists to go beyond this and furnish some sort of positive proof that there are no deities, any more than it is incumbent on one to furnish positive proof that there are no fairies if one is to be a rational "a-fairy-ist."5 Rather, the burden of proof—or, more precisely and less demandingly, the burden of justification—is on the theist and even on the agnostic like Ehrman, who, affecting the posture of the "mortal like everyone else," disclaims knowledge that there is no God (Ehrman 2008, p. 125). Not only does Ehrman misunderstand what it means to be an atheist—atheists are no more bound to claim knowledge or certainty that there is no God than theists are bound to claim knowledge or certainty that there is a God—he fails to recognize that atheism is the default position. This follows from the general presumption against the existence of putative entities—which is acknowledged, at least in practice, with respect to uncontroversially fictitious beings like fairies, gob lins, and unicorns—in the absence of any evidence that their existence is more likely 5 The analogy between disbelief in deities and disbelief in fairies is taken from Dawkins (2006, p. 37). Springer</page><page sequence="9">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 13 than not. Until the presumption of the truth of atheism can be overridden, atheism is presumptively true on grounds of simplicity. Opponents of the New Atheism are not entirely to blame for overlooking this bur den-of-proof argument. The phrase "presumption of atheism" occurs in none of the New Atheist works I'm taking as representative, and explicit meditation on the rele vance of Ockham's Razor to the question of belief in God is found only in Hitchens' God Is Not Great (Hitchens 2007, pp. 70-71). Yet even though neither Harris nor Dawkins mentions Ockham's Razor by name, both signal their reliance on the pre sumption of atheism, which in turn is grounded in Ockham's Razor. Harris remarks in his Letter to a Christian Nation that "[a]theism is not a philosophy; it is not even a view of the world; it is simply an admission of the obvious. In fact, 'atheism' is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a 'non-astrologer' or 'non-alchemist'" (Harris 2008, p. 51). In other words, atheism is presumptively true in the absence of solid evidence for theism, just as "non-astrology" and "non-alchemy" are true in the absence of solid evidence for astrology or alchemy. Dawkins' tacit acceptance of the presumption of atheism can be seen in his invocation of Bertrand Russell's famous example of the celestial teapot. In Russell's words: If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. (Dawkins 2006, p. 52) The point, of course, is that an epistemically justified atheism no more requires the positive disproof of the existence of any deity than an epistemically justified "a-teapot-ism" requires the positive disproof of the existence of any celestial teapot.6 Reliance on Ockham's Razor underlies not just isolated assertions of the New Atheists but their overall methodology as well. Working on the presupposition that one needs a good positive reason for believing in God, they devote significant por tions of their books to rebutting what many theists have traditionally taken to be good reasons for theism: design arguments, cosmological arguments, arguments from mir acles, moral arguments, etc. This fact is sufficient to dispose of Eagleton's contention that according to Dawkins and Hitchens "all Christians are fideists" (Eagleton 2009, p. 53). If they thought this, they wouldn't presume that any Christian cares about the traditional arguments for God. The point that Ockham's Razor shaves off the God hypothesis should deflect the charge that the New Atheism is faith-based, since it takes no faith to believe in the simpler of two competing hypotheses (naturalism) when the more complex hypoth esis (supernaturalism) isn't redeemed by possession of other explanatory virtues to 6 At this juncture, the theist will naturally object that the "teapot hypothesis" explains nothing, whereas the "God hypothesis" explains a great deal. Whether this is so is beside the present point. For purposes of this paper, I am focusing on common criticisms of the New Atheists that do not engage them on the question of the explanatory power of the God hypothesis. Springer</page><page sequence="10">14 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 a greater degree. What, then, are we to make of John Haught's charge that the New Atheism reflects a faith-based "scientism"? Haught never offers a definition of what he means by 'scientism,'7 but we can glean something of his understanding of it from his critique. Contra the New Atheists, he says: There is no way, without circular thinking, to set up a scientific experiment to demonstrate that every true proposition must be based in empirical evidence rather than faith. The censuring of every instance of faith, in the narrow new atheist sense of the term, would have to include the suppression of scientism also. The truly thoughtful scientific naturalists—Einstein is a good example— have been honest enough to admit that faith, especially faith that the universe is comprehensible at all, is essential to ground the work of science itself. Moreover, the claim that truth can be attained only by reason and science functioning inde pendently of any faith is itself a faith claim. Complete consistency would require that the new atheists' world of thought be cleansed of scientism and scientific naturalism as well. (Harris 2008, p. 11) Apparently, then, scientism includes the claim "that every true proposition [worth believing] must be based in empirical evidence rather than faith." But to argue against the New Atheists on the grounds that they accept as bold a proposition as this—and moreover a false dichotomy—is surely to argue against a straw man. It is highly doubtful that the New Atheists would demand "empirical evidence" for mathematical and logical truths. And they don't demand that religious beliefs be based on empir ical evidence (except insofar as the beliefs have empirical implications, regarding, for example, the efficacy of prayer8); they demand that it be based on evidence. For example, the New Atheists could in principle be convinced by Anselm's ontological argument for the existence of God, which is conceptual rather than empirical. As it happens, the New Atheists do not find the argument convincing; Dawkins rejects it for the reason famously articulated by Kant: existence is not a predicate (Dawkins 2006, p. 83). Granted, the New Atheists are not as explicit as we would expect a good epistemologist to be about what counts as evidence. I have tried to suggest how the gap might be filled in here by introducing Ockham's Razor and explanatory justification. But one need never have heard of Ockham's Razor to understand the challenge the New Atheists pose to theists: Never mind the niceties of the definition of evi dence; what do you theists say your evidence is? Is it that you feel God's presence in your life? A simpler explanation of this feeling can be constructed in terms of social conditioning and perhaps biology—simpler in the sense of avoiding supernaturalistic hypotheses that go beyond the sorts of scientific claims that already figure in estab lished explanations of other behavioral phenomena. Is it the testimony of some holy text, like the Bible or the Koran? The contradictions and immoral exhortations in these texts show that they are hardly credible regarding a question as profound as the existence of a deity. Is it one of the traditional arguments for the existence of God? 7 A typical dictionary definition, "the uncritical application of scientific or quasi-scientific methods to inappropriate fields of study or investigation" (Collins English dictionary—Complete &amp; unabridged 10th edition 2009), is too vague to be helpful. 8 See Dawkins on "The Great Prayer Experiment" (Dawkins 2006, pp. 61-66). Springer</page><page sequence="11">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 15 Dawkins, Hitchens, and Stenger have put forward refutations of the most important of these—where do they go wrong? Haught, and many other critics of the New Atheists, are frustratingly silent on these questions. Haught is correct, however, in seeing the New Atheists as naturalists; they believe that the whole of reality is identical with the whole of the natural universe. To the extent that the legitimacy of inference to the best explanation rests on the presupposi tion that unwavering laws of nature exist, the New Atheists' embrace of science does involve a "faith that the universe is comprehensible." But this "faith" assumes far less than religious faith does. The proposition that the best explanation of a given phe nomenon may legitimately be accepted as true is a canon of reasoning among all but the most dogged epistemological skeptics. Of course not everything can be explained: our explanations must begin with certain propositions taken to be facts, and these will be brute facts. The aim is to keep the brute facts to a minimum, reducing the complex, as far as possible, to the simple, without sacrificing the other explanatory virtues. According to the New Atheists, it is superfluous to postulate an intelligent supernatural being possessing an array of prodigious powers, when this postulation serves to explain nothing that cannot be explained within the confines of naturalism. Faith—ungrounded belief—in the existence of such a supernatural being is faith of a wholly different epistemic order than "faith" in the explainability of natural phenom ena. Supposing that the New Atheism is, because of its protagonists' "faith" in the comprehensibility of the universe, just as faith-based as theism is like supposing that a man with 1 % body fat is, because he has fat, just as much in need of a diet as a man with 30 % body fat. Is the New Atheism immoral? The danger to society is not merely that it should believe wrong things, though that is great enough; but that it should become credulous, and lose the habit of testing things and inquiring into them; for then it must sink back into savagery. —W. K. Clifford, "The Ethics of Belief" If we believe absurdities, we shall commit atrocities. —Voltaire I know of no society in human history that ever suffered because its people became too reasonable. —Sam Harris, The End of Faith (p. 231) The most palpable reaction the New Atheists have elicited from their opponents is indignation. It's one thing to respectfully disagree with believers. It's another thing to disparage all that is holy to them. Yet this is precisely what the New Atheists have done. Thus, for example, we find Richard Dawkins deriding the Jewish and Christian God of the Old Testament [as]arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully. (Dawkins 2006, p. 31) Springer</page><page sequence="12">16 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 We find Sam Harris declaring that Islam is undeniably a religion of conquest. The only future devout Muslims can envisage—as Muslims—is one in which all infidels have been converted to Islam, subjugated, or killed. The tenets of Islam simply do not admit of anything but a temporary sharing of power with the enemies of God. (Harris 2005, p. 110) And we find Christopher Hitchens, arguably the most acerbic of the New Atheists, offering the following diagnosis of the religious malady: ... the mildest criticism of religion is also the most radical and the most dev astating one. Religion is man-made. Even the men who made it cannot agree on what their prophets or redeemers or gurus actually said or did. Still less can they hope to tell us the "meaning" of later discoveries and developments which were, when they began, either obstructed by their religions or denounced by them. And yet—the believers claim to know! Not just to know, but to know everything. Not just to know that god exists, and that he created and supervised the whole enterprise, but also to know what "he" demands from us—from our diet to our observances to our sexual morality. In other words, in a vast and com plicated discussion where we know more and more about less and less, yet can still hope for some enlightenment as we proceed, one faction—itself composed of mutually warring factions—has the sheer arrogance to tell us that we already have all the essential information we need. Such stupidity, combined with such pride, should be enough on its own to exclude "belief" from the debate. The person who is certain, and who claims divine warrant for his certainty, belongs now to the infancy of our species. It may be a long farewell, but it has begun and, like all farewells, should not be protracted. (Hitchens 2007, pp. 10-11) For such statements as these, the New Atheists are berated as "angry," hateful, "militant," "intolerant," and "strident" (among many other appellations: Reitan 2009, p. 33; Fiala 2009; Miller 2009). As such labels are frequently used for moral censure, they raise the question: Is the New Atheism immoral? I respond to this challenge by way of examining two more basic questions: Are these labels accurate? And, to the extent that they are, do they point to something morally objectionable? One reason to consider some of these labels inaccurate is that their application to the New Atheists rests on a double-standard. Hardly anyone would think of calling the great Southern Baptist preacher Billy Graham an angry, hateful, militant, intolerant, strident Christian, yet in many of his classic sermons he fervently condemned to eternal hellfire anyone who wasn't a born-again Christian. As Dawkins is fond of pointing out, the derogatory sense of 'strident' is applied with unfair liberality to the New Atheists: "When somebody offers an opinion about anything other than religion—say, politics or economics or football—they will use language that is no more or less outspoken than mine, and it isn't called strident" (Miller 2009). Reitan's claim to see "hate ... in the spewing vitriol of Dawkins" (Reitan 2009, p. 33) is gratuitous and worse than uncharitable, given that Dawkins' language is consistent with a benevolent concern for the well-being of humanity combined with a firm—and argued—conviction that religion, on the whole, has been and continues to be a threat to that well-being. While it's true to say that the New Atheists are "militant" in the sense that denotes active Ô Springer</page><page sequence="13">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 17 and aggressive support of a cause, the word carries connotations of violence that are completely inapplicable. The New Atheists are no more militant than Billy Graham was during his decades of active preaching, but hardly anyone calls Graham a "mil itant Christian." Likewise, the term 'intolerant' applies to the New Atheists only in a relatively benign sense. They do find repugnant many of the irrational beliefs and immoral behaviors adopted by religious persons. However, any suggestion that the New Atheists are opposed to freedom of religion is unfounded. Contrary to Haught's allegation, there is no evidence that the New Atheists would prefer that "the Absolute [be] disposed of officially" (Harris 2008, p. 76; emphasis added). It is safe to say that they value the freedom that allows them to voice theologically unpopular opinions without fear of punishment (or at least without fear of legal punishment). Nonetheless, it can be conceded that at least two negative or disapproving emotions imbue the works of the New Atheists: frustration and disrespect. Are these emotions immoral? Surely frustration in itself is not a moral failing; frustration with the status quo has been a common trait of history's great reformers (which is not to imply that the New Atheists are among history's great reformers). Nor is there any plausible moral requirement that irrationality and immorality be respected. Still, even if the New Atheists cannot be faulted for having these negative emotions, they could be at fault for expressing them in their books and public appearances. What could be the justification for not adopting a kinder, gentler tone? Religion and irrationality Underlying the New Atheists' sense of urgency and no-holds-barred rhetoric is the conviction that, quite literally, the fate of the world depends on how well humanity can overcome its innate propensity toward irrationality—toward epistemically unjus tified belief, toward adopting beliefs without good reasons. (On my understanding of the term 'irrationality,' probably every human being that has beliefs is guilty of some degree of irrationality. Probably no human being is epistemically perfect, just as probably no human being is morally perfect. Hence I do not mean for 'irrational' to have the harshness of an epithet applied only to the worst of the worst, though I do intend it as a negative evaluation of epistemic behavior.) The New Atheists focus on religion not out of some animus against religion as such but because in their view irra tionality is so powerfully manifested in and reinforced by so many forms of religion. Illustrations of widespread but irrational beliefs derived from religion abound. Consider first a scenario that Sam Harris poses in Letter to a Christian Nation: It is, therefore, not an exaggeration to say that if the city of New York were suddenly replaced by a ball of fire, some significant percentage of the American population would see a silver-lining in the subsequent mushroom cloud, as it would suggest to them that the best thing that is ever going to happen was about to happen: the return of Christ. It should be blindingly obvious that beliefs of this sort will do little to help us create a durable future for ourselves—socially, economically, environmentally, or geopolitically. Imagine the consequences if any significant component of the U.S. government actually believed that the world was about to end and that its ending would be glorious. The fact that •£) Springer</page><page sequence="14">18 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 nearly half of the American population apparently believes this, purely on the basis of religious dogma, should be considered a moral and intellectual emer gency. (Harris 2008, p. xii) Dawkins approvingly cites this passage in The God Delusion, and he adds to Har ris's hypothetical scenario a number of actual statements by persons of influence in the United States. Examples include: the assertion by James Watt, while serving as Secretary of the Interior under Ronald Reagan, that "[w]e don't have to protect the environment, the Second Coming is at hand"; the late Reverend Jerry Falwell's explanation that "AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals; it is God's pun ishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals"; and Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson's gentle admonition to women, "I know this is painful for the ladies to hear, but if you get married, you have accepted the headship of a man, your husband. Christ is the head of the household and the husband is the head of the wife, and that's the way it is, period" (Dawkins 2006, pp. 288, 289, 290). Had Dawkins published The God Delusion a few years later, he likely would have added the case of Illinois Con gressman John Shimkus, now chairman of the House Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy, who in a Congressional hearing in March 2009 offered assurance that "The planet won't be destroyed by global warming because God promised Noah" (Mail Foreign Service 2010). The prevalence of such beliefs is just as cringe-inducing for many religious mod erates as it is for the New Atheists. Consequently, the referencing of such howlers by the New Atheists is likely to elicit from moderates cries of "straw man!" and "hasty generalization!" Contrary to popular conception, however, the New Atheists do not view all forms of religion as equally dangerous. They acknowledge that there are a multitude of religions around the world, and that many of them come in more fun damentalist and more moderate forms. They recognize that the more fundamentalist forms of religion are more likely to give rise to bizarre and dangerous beliefs. In spite of all this, the reason the New Atheists can criticize present-day (supematu ralistic) religion in general rather than always targeting specific faiths or denominations is that it is not religious belief as such that worries them. It is the intellectual sloth that often, in our modern era of scientific explanation, both enables and is enabled by it—the readiness to adopt beliefs without evidence, or with grossly insufficient evidence; this is the crux of irrationality, as the New Atheists see it. Of course this sort of intellectual sloth comes in degrees. When it comes to science, for example, fundamentalists possess it in greater measure than moderates. But if, in our modern scientific era, all religious beliefs are based on insufficient evidence, as the New Athe ists argue, then all religious beliefs manifest some degree of intellectual sloth (which is not to deny that there are some very smart and intellectually industrious religious believers!). In responding to nonbeliever critics who have admonished him for alienating evo lution-friendly theists, Harris gets to the heart of the New Atheists' epistemic concern: The goal is not to get more Americans to merely accept the truth of evolution (or any other scientific theory); the goal is to get them to value the principles of reasoning and educated discourse that now make a belief in evolution oblig atory. Doubt about evolution is merely a symptom of an underlying condition; â Springer</page><page sequence="15">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 19 the condition is faith itself—conviction without sufficient reason, hope mistaken for knowledge, bad ideas protected from good ones, good ideas obscured by bad ones, wishful thinking elevated to a principle of salvation, etc. (Harris 2010, p. 175) The persistence of ubiquitous religious belief is a doubly negative sign: it reveals our lack of progress toward a rational ideal, and it bodes ill for a future filled with some of the most daunting challenges—natural-resource depletion, climate change, religious fanaticism in an age of "weapons of mass destruction"—humankind has ever faced. These challenges will be difficult enough to meet even if tackled with concerted rational action. They may be impossible to meet if a substantial swath of humanity continues to allow its beliefs to be governed by the forces of tradition, self-justification, and wishful thinking, rather than by evidence. These stakes reveal that alarm over the persistence of human irrationality—especially within the United States, the world's most powerful country and the home of the New Atheists' primary target audience— does not constitute a kind of reason-fetishism. Rationality matters because it is integral to the welfare of the human race. How, exactly, are religion and irrationality intertwined? This is not the place for anything like a detailed discussion—that would be too expansive an undertaking— but an illustrative sketch can perhaps be provided. Consider how religion exploits and engenders five prevalent intellectual vices: black-and-white thinking, wishful thinking, close-mindedness, false certainty, and credulity. (These intellectual vices are not all mutually exclusive of each other, but rather in various ways overlap and mutually condition each other.) Famously, Aristotle's Metaphysics begins with the declaration that "[a]ll men by nature desire to know." If we take 'know' to be a success term, as we normally do, then Aristotle's observation is clearly Pollyannaish: It is far from the case that all human beings desire to have only justified true beliefs (or whatever the defining character istics of genuine knowledge may be), and as many justified true beliefs as possible. Human beings historically have been astoundingly superstitious and uncritical; many continue to be even in the more scientifically literate countries. But suppose we take 'know' to refer to "illusory knowing" as well—to "certainties," be they true or false. Then Aristotle's dictum seems much more plausible. Human beings naturally fear the unknown; they naturally want to feel as though they understand and can control the events that affect them.9 And they naturally want to think of themselves as sensi ble, morally decent people. Fulfilling these wants doesn't require them to have actual knowledge but only "certainty," the firm belief that they have actual knowledge. This is why simplistic, black-and-white thinking—it is easier to believe one knows simple, black-and-white facts than complex, shades-of-gray facts—wishful thinking, and false certainty are such widespread and intractable epistemic vices. While these epistemic vices are inherent in human nature, human beings differ in how well they overcome them. All too often, religion taps into and nurtures these vices. The Christian tradition, for example, abounds in oversimplifying dichotomies: 9 The health benefits, both physical and emotional, of having control over one's environment are well known. See, e.g., Haidt (2006, pp. 92-93). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="16">20 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 people are either righteous or wicked (or perhaps everyone is wicked); Jesus was sin less, everyone else is sinful; believers go to Heaven, unbelievers to Hell; a person is sexually pure or sexually impure; foods are clean or unclean. The wish to escape suffering and death can be fulfilled by praying to a loving, interventionist God; and no matter what happens in this world, one can take comfort from the promise of eternal bliss in the next. Such simplistic, wishful thinking is the very antithesis of the humble, questioning, innovating, hypothesizing, experimenting, evidence-adducing scientific mindset. The great astronomer and science-educator Carl Sagan poignantly captures this dimension of difference between religion and science: ... the organized religions do not inspire me with confidence. Which leaders of the major faiths acknowledge that their beliefs might be incomplete or errone ous and establish institutes to uncover possible doctrinal deficiencies? Beyond the test of everyday living, who is systematically testing the circumstances in which traditional religious teaching may no longer apply? ... What sermons even-handedly examine the God hypothesis? What rewards are religious skep tics given by the established religions ... ? (Sagan 1996, p. 34) It is probably no accident that the advent of the scientific mindset (on a wider scale than in ancient times) coincided with the beginning of the Age of Enlightenment, which ushered in advances not only in science, including medicine, but in politics, economics, morals, the arts, and other areas as well. Why was the age of modern exper imental science so slow in arriving? In large part because of the vice grip religion held on people's minds and actions. As Sam Harris has observed: There is no telling what our world would now be like had some great kingdom of Reason emerged at the time of the Crusades and pacified the credulous mul titudes of Europe and the Middle East. We might have had modern democracy and the Internet by the year 1600. (Harris 2005, p. 109) When the proponent of any understanding of the natural world at odds with "holy scripture" or established tradition is threatened by imprisonment or execution in this world, or eternal suffering in the next, it is difficult for new scientific ideas to be con ceived, much less be disseminated, tested, and refined. True, scientific genius and piety are not psychologically incompatible—witness Sir Isaac Newton, and even Galileo, despite his troubles with church authorities—and a large degree of accommodation between science and religion has been achieved by interpreting passages of scripture as metaphors or edifying myths. But religion deserves no credit for such rapprochement. As Harris notes: The doors leading out of scriptural literalism do not open from the inside. The moderation we see among nonfundamentalists is not some sign that faith itself has evolved; it is, rather, the product of the many hammer blows of modernity that have exposed certain tenets of faith to doubt. (Harris 2005, pp. 18-19) By way of further contrast with the scientific mindset, many a religious mindset is encumbered by the complementary vices of close-mindedness and false certainty. Neurologist Robert Burton, in his recent book On Being Certain: Believing You Are Right Even When You 're Not, explains that certainty "is neither a conscious choice nor "Ö Springer</page><page sequence="17">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 21 even a thought process. Certainty and similar states of knowing what we know arise out of involuntary brain mechanisms that, like love or anger, function independently of reason" (Burton 2008, p. xi). Like love and anger, certainty is a feeling, the dis position to which can be strengthened or inhibited by our decisions to ignore or seek out potentially countervailing evidence. The epistemic virtue to be cultivated here is active open-mindedness, to use the term coined by Jonathan Baron, one of the leading psychologists of judgment and decision-making. Active open-mindedness counteracts the all-too-natural tendency to "ignore possibilities, evidence, and goals that we ought to consider, and [to] make inferences in ways that protect our favored ideas" (Baron 2008, p. xiii). Religions generally cultivate, at least with respect to broadly theological matters, the very antithesis of active open-mindedness. Not only do religious communities claim to be already in possession of the most profound metaphysical and moral cer tainties; they have also developed strategies to reinforce and protect these certainties. Psychologist Valerie Tarico observes: Conversion experiences can be intense, hypnotic, and transformative. Worship practices, music and religious architecture have been optimized over time to evoke right-brain sensations of transcendence and euphoria. Social insularity protects a community consensus. Repetition of ideas reinforces a sense of convic tion or certainty. Forms of Christianity that emphasize right belief have built-in safeguards against contrary evidence, doubt, and the assertions of other religions. (Tarico 2010, p. 54) These last safeguards are forms of close-mindedness and are at least as old as the books of the Bible. In his essay "The Ethics of Religion," W. K. Clifford singles out for reproach two Gospel passages that employ fear and hope, respectively, to ward off theological doubt: "He that believeth not shall be damned" (Mark 16:16) and "Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed" (John 20:29) (Clifford 1999, p. 102). And Deuteronomy prescribes a highly effective method of combatting advocates of other religions: If a prophet arises among you, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or wonder, and the sign or wonder which he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, "Let us go after other gods," which you have not known, "and let us serve them," you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or to that dreamer of dreams; for the Lord your God is testing you, to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. You shall walk after the Lord your God and fear him, and keep his commandments and obey his voice, and you shall serve him and cleave to him. But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has taught rebellion against the Lord your God (13:1-5) Consider finally the intellectual vice of credulity. A standard dictionary defini tion of 'credulity' is "willingness to believe or trust too readily, especially without proper or adequate evidence" (credulity n.d.). Credulity is obviously closely related to a standard meaning of 'faith': "belief that is not based on proof" (faith n.d.). Hence it is natural for Sam Harris to observe—although he offends many believers in doing Ô Springer</page><page sequence="18">22 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 so—that "[f]aith is what credulity becomes when it finally achieves escape velocity from the constraints of terrestrial discourse—constraints like reasonableness, internal coherence, civility, and candor" (Harris 2005, p. 65). While all of the New Atheists have assailed particular "faith-based" beliefs as contributing causes of persecution, terrorism, murder, and war, it is Harris who has most clearly recognized the crucial importance of the connection between belief and action in general. One of the central points of his chapter "The Nature of Belief' in The End of Faith is that "[b]eliefs are principles of action: whatever they may be at the level of the brain, they are processes by which our understanding (and misunderstanding) of the world is represented and made available to guide our behavior" (Harris 2005, p. 52). On any consequentialist view of morality, credulous—and thus unjustified—beliefs are to be opposed since they tend to give rise at best to ineffectual actions and at worst to atrocities: the most monstrous crimes against humanity have invariably been inspired by unjustified belief. This is nearly a truism. Genocidal projects tend not to reflect the rationality of their perpetrators simply because there are no good reasons to kill peaceful people indiscriminately. Even where such crimes have been secular, they have required the egregious credulity of entire societies to be brought off. (Harris 2005, pp. 78-79) Trying to combat harmful actions without rectifying the underlying unjustified beliefs is like trying to cure an illness by addressing only its symptoms. But Harris and the other New Atheists might have gone farther. What we believe, and the processes by which we form our beliefs, are ethical matters not only because they can give rise to atrocities but because sound beliefs and belief-forming habits are integral to the efficient solution of all of the problems that confront us. We can efficiently solve problems only when we quickly and accurately represent their nature to ourselves—i.e., only when we efficiently form true beliefs about them. Even the religious will likely give their assent to this proposition. What they fail to realize, how ever, is that any acceptance of a religious tenet "on faith" works to instill an intellectual tendency toward credulity that ineluctably ventures outside the bounds of theology, making the stakes far higher than mere doctrinal rectitude. The locus classicus for this point of view is of course Clifford's essay "The Ethics of Belief." "No real belief, however trifling and fragmentary it may seem," Clifford observed, is ever truly insignificant; it prepares us to receive more of its like, confirms those which resembled it before, and weakens others; and so gradually it lays a stealthy train in our inmost thoughts, which may someday explode into overt action, and leave its stamp upon our character for ever. (Clifford 1999, p. 73) What's more, even unjustified beliefs that never have occasion to prompt action, in the usual understanding of the word, are apt to be passed on to others: no one man's belief is in any case a private matter which concerns himself alone. Our lives are guided by that general conception of the course of things which has been created by society for social purposes. Our words, our phrases, our forms and processes and modes of thought, are common property, fashioned and perfected from age to age; an heirloom which every succeeding generation &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="19">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 23 inherits as a precious deposit and a sacred trust to be handed on to the next one, not unchanged but enlarged and purified, with some clear marks of its proper handiwork. Into this, for good or ill, is woven every belief of every man who has speech of his fellows. (Clifford 1999, pp. 73-74) A natural objection to Clifford at this point is that he has overlooked a common dox astic phenomenon: the ability of people to draw a strict line of demarcation between their religious beliefs and their secular beliefs. Aren't there religious scientists, for example, who systematically employ one, more credulous, set of epistemic standards at the church, synagogue, or mosque and another, more skeptical, set in the labora tory? Evidence that theological credulity on the one hand and scientific incredulity or skepticism on the other cannot, in general, be neatly compartmentalized is found in the fact that the best scientists are overwhelmingly unbelievers. In The God Delusion, Dawkins cites the study by Larson and Witham, published in 1998 in the preeminent scientific journal Nature, which "showed that of those American scientists considered eminent enough by their peers to have been elected to the National Academy of Sci ences (equivalent to being a Fellow of the Royal Society in Britain) only about 7 % believe in a personal God" (Dawkins 2006, p. 100). Another community of intellectuals generally held to be comparatively adept at critical thinking, academic philosophers, are overwhelmingly atheistic as well. According to one survey, 69.7 % of respondents with a Ph.D. in philosophy "accept or lean toward" atheism, whereas only 16.3 % "accept or lean toward" theism (Bourget and Chalmers n.d.). The fundamental difficulty with the notion that separate epistemic standards can be deployed in the realm of religion and the realm of science is that there is no neat demarcation to be drawn between the two realms. The paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould famously dubbed religion and science "non-overlapping magisterial The magisterium, or domain, of science "covers the empirical realm: what is the universe made of (fact) and why does it work this way (theory). The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value" (Gould 1999, p. 6). I have nothing to add to Dawkins's and Stenger's dismantlings of this distinction. As Stenger notes, contrary to the impression Gould gives, "religions do more than just preach on morality. They make claims about the real world—about space, time, and matter—that are thereby open to scientific testing" (Stenger 2009, p. 69). A deity that is completely causally isolated from the physical universe, a deity that has never revealed his nature or his will to any human being, a deity that never answers prayers or works miracles, is not the sort of deity belief in which alarms the New Atheists. Nor is it the sort of deity whose existence is endorsed by the vast majority of religious believers. The need for social disapproval In a world threatened by climate change, war, terrorism, and "weapons of mass destruc tion," irrational tendencies such as black-and-white thinking, wishful thinking, close mindedness, false certainty, and credulity can quickly have life-or-death consequences, especially when they manifest in antipathy toward science and members of social out groups. How are these tendencies to be combatted? Better education, including greater &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="20">24 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 access to it, is certainly part of the answer. But another likely part of it is social dis approval. Just as social disapproval is a key ingredient in keeping crime rates from escalating out of control, so we should expect it to be a key ingredient in combatting irrational beliefs and the often tragic actions to which they give rise. It is here that the question of the moral propriety of expressed frustration and disrespect becomes relevant. The New Atheists offend religious fundamentalists and moderates, and even some agnostics and atheists, in large part because of their obvious frustration with and lack of respect for religious belief. But might the display of these emotions toward irratio nal religious beliefs be morally justified, at least if we take a consequentialist view of morality? Newsweek reporter and editor Lisa Miller claims that Dawkins' blunt style (she says "strident") will "alienate" the "[n]inety percent of Americans [who] say they believe in God" (Miller 2009). This no doubt overestimates both the percentage of Americans who believe in God and the sensitivity of a fair number of believers. But even if Miller were completely correct in this assessment, it would not prove that the New Atheists' blunt and disrespectful critiques of religion lack a consequentialist moral justification. If we as a society come to see the typically unchallenged statement "I have faith that such-and-such is true" as equivalent to the intellectually irresponsible "I believe that such-and-such is true even though I have no good evidence for it," we will have taken an important step toward becoming more rational and beginning to overcome all of the problems our propensity toward irrationality has given rise to. Battles to change public opinion are always fought first at the margins, and that is where the New Atheist manifestoes aim—at those who are already suspicious of the intellectual integrity of religious doctrines, or at those whose theological convic tions are tenuous. Since most people, or at least most young people, adopt the beliefs of those with whom they are in greatest social proximity, convincing some of the small fraction of people at the margins of religious belief could set in motion a slow but exponentially growing trend toward liberation from the intellectual shackles of religion. What will actually happen is of course uncertain. Religious evangelists and indoctrinators will continue to peddle consoling simplisms to an irrational audience prone to existential anxieties. It is unmistakably the view of the New Atheists that religion is a net detriment to societies around the world. In making their case for this view, they have, according to many of their critics, been guilty of cherry-picking from the relevant evidence. In the words of Haught, the new atheists unveil religion at its absolute ugliest. They are not interested in taking a balanced approach essential to real scholarship. Serving up the most extreme forms of rabid religiosity, they try to convince their readers that this repugnant material is the essence of faith. What most of us consider the most objectionable religious expressions sum up for the new atheists what the theistic faiths are really all about. (Harris 2008, p. 28) I hope I have dispelled the notion that, for the New Atheists, "the most objection able religious expressions sum up what the theistic faiths are really all about." As I have noted, Dawkins, and especially Harris, explicitly criticize the less Springer</page><page sequence="21">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 25 objectionable, moderate forms of religion as well as the more objectionable, fun damentalist forms. Admittedly, however, the New Atheists have not dealt with the question of the over all value of religion in its full, daunting complexity. In a recent essay in this journal, Christopher Callaway identifies a number of questions a thorough analysis would have to take into consideration: (Q 1.1) What exactly is "religion?" (Q1.2) Is it distorting to treat religion as a single category rather than looking at individual religions? (Q1.3) Should all expressions of a particular religion be considered, or only the best or most authentic ones? (Q1.4) In what sense and in what ways can religion be said to "cause" anything? (Q1.5) What is the relation between religion's causal influence and individual moral responsibility? (Q2.1) Do salviflc goods count? (Q2.2) Are human beings immortal? (Q2.3) What else will count as benefits and harms caused specifically by religion? (Q3.1) In what way and to what extent are the relevant values and harms commen surable? (Q3.2) How can the relevant benefits and harms be compared across persons? (Q3.3) What are the relevant counterfactuals, and how should they factor in? (Q3.4) What does the evidence show about how religion's consequential value will change over time and across social contexts? (Callaway 2011) I agree with Callaway that "finding ... answers [to these questions] looks to be extraordinarily complicated, and can result only from far more empirical research and philosophical analysis than has yet been performed" (Callaway 2011, p. 245). For pur poses of defending the moral permissibility of the New Atheists' critique of religion, however, I think it is fair to focus on a different question: Will the earthly welfare of human beings in general (and whatever other kinds of beings possess a welfare that matters morally) be better promoted the more human beings develop the habit of adopting only beliefs supported by sufficient evidence? This leaves out "salvific" goods and goods that may come with immortality, but so long as the New Atheists' critique of the very existence of such goods is not rebutted, it is question-begging to argue on the basis of such goods.10 Given that actions aimed at promoting human welfare that are guided by beliefs based on sufficient evidence are much more likely to succeed in promoting human welfare than actions guided by beliefs not based on sufficient evidence, the value of an epistemic habit of believing only on the basis of suf ficient evidence seems clear. And insofar as religious beliefs lack sufficient evidence, holding them can only hinder the development of the proper epistemic habit. The well-being of a society depends on the interplay of a byzantine array of factors, but the hypothesis that lack of religiosity promotes societal well-being is certainly con sistent with the available data. According to Gallup Polls from 2007 and 2008, "the 10 Besides, to echo a common criticism of Pascal's wager, if a deity does exist, it could be the case that it rewards rationality eternally and punishes irrationality eternally. Springer</page><page sequence="22">26 Int J Philos Reiig (2013) 73:5-28 10 least religious countries studied include several with the world's highest living standards, including Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Hong Kong, and Japan" (Crabtree and Pelham 2009). Sam Harris has observed that on almost every measure of societal health, the least religious countries are better off than the most religious. Countries like Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands-—which are the most atheistic societies on earth—consistently rate better than religious nations on measures like life expectancy, infant mortality, crime, literacy, GDP, child welfare, economic equality, economic competitive ness, gender equality, health care, investments in education, rates of university enrollment, internet access, environmental protection, lack of corruption, polit ical stability, and charity to poorer nations, etc. (Harris 2010, p. 146) Conclusion Perhaps, contra the New Atheists, some form of theism can be rationally vindicated. Perhaps the arguments of the New Atheists against the traditional proofs of God's existence are flawed in certain respects. If so, it is open to their critics to defend one or more of these proofs against the New Atheists' criticisms, or to present novel argu ments for the existence of God. Or, more radically, these critics could reject Ockham's Razor (although this would fly in the face of both the methodology of science and most of our everyday reasoning about objects and events that we don't immediately perceive). A significant number of anti-New Atheists are not taking any of these approaches. Instead, they accuse the New Atheists of attacking straw men and invalidly inferring the truth of atheism from the falsity of fundamentalism. I have argued that such accu sations misconstrue the New Atheists' polemics. The New Atheists cannot fairly be accused of attacking straw men in lambasting fundamentalism, since in the U.S. alone there are over 100 million fundamentalists. And the New Atheists aren't making an invalid inference to the truth of atheism, for, in a sense, they do not infer to atheism at all; rather, they start with atheism as the default position, as it is simpler than the ism. Since, other things being equal, we should accept simpler positions over more complex competing positions, what the New Atheists argue for is just what we should expect: that, for the theist, other things are at best equal—that theism cannot offset in explanatory power what it lacks in simplicity. The default status of atheism gives the lie to the fashionable objection that the New Atheists are just as much in the grip of blind faith as the fundamentalists who bear the brunt (though hardly the entirety) of their criticism. It takes no faith to believe in the absence of something when there is no good evidence for its presence, whether we are talking about fairies, celestial teapots, or supernatural deities. If there is good evidence for the existence of God, the criticisms of the New Atheism ought to make use of it. As for the notion that the New Atheists are objectionably disrespectful toward reli gion, while I certainly do not wish to equate religion with Nazism—no present-day world religion includes genocide as a tenet—we would do well to heed the words of Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments and War Production in the Third Reich, on the importance of social correctives to irrationality: Springer</page><page sequence="23">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 73:5-28 27 [I]n normal circumstances people who turn their backs on reality are soon set straight by the mockery and criticism of those around them, which makes them aware they have lost credibility. In the Third Reich there were no such correc tives, especially for those who belonged to the upper stratum. On the contrary, every self-deception was multiplied as in a hall of distorting mirrors, becoming a repeatedly confirmed picture of a fantastical dream world which no longer bore any relationship to the grim outside world. In those mirrors I could see nothing but my own face reproduced many times over. (Speer 1997, p. 291) The "grim outside world" humanity now faces can be successfully negotiated only with a clear-eyed recognition of the challenges it presents. Now that, in several respects, we are pushing against the limits of the planet's capacity to support us, it is more important than ever that we not be blinded by an unquestioning allegiance to fantastical religious dogmas, our self-deceptions "multiplied as in a hall of distorting mirrors." The New Atheists are doing humanity a service by withholding respect from and bestowing criticism on religious beliefs that are either detached from reality or sorely lacking in justification.
