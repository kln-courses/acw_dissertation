STRODACH Lafayette College The last years of the Roman Republic were marked not only by political disruption but by the failure of religion and critical in- telligence as well. A century of anarchy, in which force was the sole basis of authority, had stimulated individualism and by re- laxing family discipline had appreciably liberalized the Puritanic mores common enough in pre-Gracchan society; a century of im- perialistic exploitation and contact with Greek life and thought had revealed the full potentialities of money, pleasure, and per- sonal freedom. Because of the dangers attending political dis- tinction in an age ruled by militarists and strong men, gloria as a public career was less attractive and the business of money-making became a prevalent occupation; an expanding imperialism and a commensurately expanding national economy were putting the new capitalist class in the saddle. The opening up of an empire by irresponsible business interests had shoved equity and moral issues into the background. The economic disparity between the im- poverished urban proletariat and the moneyed classes only height- ened materialism. Political turbulence, the insecurity of property and of life itself, and a flair for freethinking among the educated combined to devitalize theistic belief in a stable, benevolent, and partially controllable world order. The state religion was a pretense and mockery. The native ritual of the Romans was mainly agrarian in origin; and, though its forms were punctiliously maintained, they had ceased to be com- prehensible and emotionally necessary for a dispossessed and 1</page><page sequence="2">2 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL urbanized peasantry. Formerly religion had been employed in critical times by the authorities to allay group hysteria or to make the lower orders tractable to governmental policy. Now the es- tablished religion was frankly regarded by theorists and utilitarian statesmen merely as an instrument of social cohesion and as an opiate for the proletariat. What was worse, the formalized religious machinery now permitted cynical manipulation and throughout the last half century of the Republic was currently abused in the interests of partisan politics. The official ritual was not only ceas- ing to function organically in the society which still supported it; but, because of its legalistic approach to its deities, it was de- void of emotional satisfaction as well, and fostered a contractual relationship which the worshiper was willing to maintain only so long as he got what he had bargained for. The anthropomorphism of Greek mythology, which had been superimposed upon the im- personal and abstract deities of the antique Roman religion, was discredited by the intelligent and the credulous alike. It had, in fact, never come to life in the Roman imagination, and the moral- ity which it exemplified was too ridiculously human to serve as anything but pabulum for poets and cynics. A ritual inadequate for an urban society and too formalized to contain the religious emotions of a nervous and despairing age, the abuse of certain observances as a political expedient, and the triviality of its theology were three major factors in the discredit- ing of the state religion. But, in spite of the discontinuity of po- litical and religious traditions, fin de sidcle Republican society did not fall apart nor was it irreligious throughout. In increasing num- bers the pauperized lower classes and noblewomen tasting eman- cipation for the first time were seeking emotional compensations for misery and discontent; in the undignified practices of the Near Eastern mystery cults they found periodic excitement, unction for social injustice, and the assurance of personal salvation. A few re- actionaries like Varro sought by historical investigation to revive interest in the traditional institutions of the established religion; others romantically expected a political savior with whose advent the world would automatically revert to a utopian Golden Age. Even the religion of Stoic pantheism became a kind of romanti-</page><page sequence="3">HORACE'S INDIVIDUALISM RECONSIDERED 3 cism in the hands of intellectuals of the ruling class; the teleology of Stoicism supplied these imperialists with a theoretical argu- ment by which they could justify their notions of Manifest Des- tiny, and ended by giving a fillip to their dreams of empire. But the typical Roman, temperamentally an extrovert and a realist, still remained too self-contained and dignified to give way to emo- tionalism or romanticism. Increasingly he became skeptical of the claims of religion, established religion as well as that of the poets. Throughout this period he declared his emancipation by cynicism and immorality, and at the same time, at the instance of an en- tirely practical religiosity, he fell back upon the approved forms of superstition. In great numbers the average man docilely submit- ted to a stultifying fatalism, pursued an opportunist ethic, and stupidly denied the power of character to change the course of events. Chaos and disbelief were aggravated for the nobly born Roman by the fact that during these years he was losing his intimate con- nection with those groups-the family and the State--which had formulated his purposes, educated him to live by a moral code, and vitalized all his action. Now, with the gradual dissolution of those unities, the gregarious Roman found himself, socially and politic- ally, more or less of an individual; it still remained for him to explore both the moral and the spiritual implications of his new status. He most naturally turned to philosophy for guidance. For Greek philosophy at Rome had been a factor in creating individu- alism; it had acted as a solvent upon religious institutions, had made men critical of unreflective conformity to the aristocratic code, and had fomented what passed for enlightened self-interest. But it had not remained content with the work of emancipation. It earnestly instructed the neophyte in the proper use of freedom; it exhorted him to look within himself and discover there what was right and wrong, what was valuable and what was not valuable. As a matter of fact, no positive advance was made by substitut- ing a subjective sanction for conduct for the older corporate sanc- tion of society. This was merely an incentive to untrammeled self- expression, since the first stages of emancipation regularly include experimentation in living and the search for personal values by the</page><page sequence="4">4 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL interesting method of trial and error. It was inevitable, for exam- ple, that the negative hedonism and enlightened self-interest of pure Epicureanism should degenerate into self-seeking and mere expansiveness of the instinctive personality, for the life-loving Ro- man never equated pleasure merely with the absence of pain, and consequently was unwilling to submit himself to the ascetic regi- men of an Epicurus. The Stoic scheme, in theory at least, was not open to such gross misapplication. It pointed out that what dis- tinguished men from animals was the reasoning faculty, and found in the reason the only sanction for conduct which was at once in- dividualistic and universally binding. In practice, however, it was soon discovered that rationalism was not necessarily synonymous with morality. To act rationally could justifiably be interpreted by the pragmatic Roman as acting with deliberation and calcula- tion, not according to right principles, for was it not the natural function of the reason to suggest the appropriate means to a de- sired endI rather than to evaluate the goodness or the badness of a desired object? Thus it was incidental to 'rational' conduct whether one desired the good, the apparent good, or even the bad. The spiritual implications of individualism and the larger ques- tion of the nature of the universe and the individual's relation to it were never sufficiently clarified and exploited at Rome. The prac- titioners of Greek philosophy had too generally assumed that Roman practicality could not be interested in speculation about the psyche or in theoretical science. They overlooked the fact that the pragmatic attitude is readily convertible into the inductive method of science, and accordingly directed philosophical thinking at Rome largely toward ethical ends. It was unfortunate for the growth of science that the Stoic system, which by reason of its teleological and ethical aspects was more appealing to the national prejudices than any other system, should have entailed a meta- physic which was baffling. The Stoic postulate that Reason is the sole reality in the universe proved a major difficulty. An a priori assumption such as this was repugnant to the Roman mind, which 1 This is Horace's conception of rationalism; see note 80, below. In Epist. I, 2, 17-31 Ulysses is the prototype of the rational man in contradistinction to the suitors, who are typical of the acquisitive and impulsive common man.</page><page sequence="5">HORACE'S INDIVIDUALISM RECONSIDERED 5 had always regarded the primacy of empirical reality as self-evi- dent. This impasse created a distrust of metaphysics in particular and of philosophical technique in general, and, what is worse, it damaged whatever interest there was in the methodology of sci- ence. It is regrettable that the Roman had not ceased to be pre- occupied with his metaphysical difficulty before the early Empire, when Epicureanism roused the puritanic ire of the government and passed completely under a cloud. For even if he did not accept its negative hedonism as a way of life, he would at least have found scientific materialism stimulating to his natural curiosity; more congenial, certainly, than Stoic mysticism, and more liberating than the barbarities of the invading Oriental cults. The national religion was atrophied and bankrupt. Greek phi- losophy had not only served Rome ill by thwarting her potential interest in science, but was unconsciously abetting the predilec- tions of a nobility in a state of transition. In advocating rational- ism or hedonism as a way of life, it unluckily promoted casuistry and immorality. Men could call good that which they desired, and could act accordingly; nor was it difficult afterwards to devise a facile justification. If intelligent Romans hardly required a whole systematic philosophy in order to solve the immediate problems of their new freedom, they did require the ministrations of a moralist, a native critic who had a direct intuition of his country- men's needs, and who, having achieved sanity himself, could offer guidance to others.2 The new working philosophy would be dis- tinctively Roman, not by virtue of its originality, but in the prob- lems and the tenets which it selected for emphasis; it would base itself on common-sense rationalism and would eliminate all specu- lative and transcendental questions from its consideration; it would be socially minded and would seek to counteract contemp- orary materialism; by invoking native Roman self-control as the moral imperative it would endeavor to modify rank naturalism; and, finally, it would aim to serve the best interests of individual- ism by replacing the dilapidated ideals of the ruling class with oth- er positive values. 2 Cf. Horace, Epist. I, 1, 20-32, 47 f.</page><page sequence="6">6 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL This task of tentative formulation the poet Horace was not un- qualified to perform for Rome. Born of honest rural stock, he was early indoctrinated in the homespun virtues of the countryside, which, he was later to declare, had made Rome great.3 Thanks largely to his country distrust of sophisticated urban civilization,4 he was forced into the defensive attitude of the critic, and continued to live as a detached participant in his age. In middle life he en- joyed the company and the confidence of great men and became emboldened to prescribe a way of life for the crass would-be and near great.' Considering himself the heir of the satiric tradition, he found in it a vehicle of didacticism which had already endeared itself to the Italian heart. An excellent technician in verse rather than a competent thinker, he avoided the conventional media of philosophy and chose to continue that type of philosophical writ- ing, very popular in antiquity, which combined poetry with moralizing and illustrated morality by examples from mythology and the national history. An amiable man,he disavowed all polemic intention in criticizing his age6 and found it impossible to lay lustily about him, as did the rabid Juvenal four generations later. Being humanitarian in his instincts and good-natured in his stric- tures on public behavior, he won popularity and could reconcile society to seeing itself as he saw it. Yet the extent of his positive influence must remain in doubt for the reason that his values were largely conditioned by his own temperament. By the time of the publication of the Odes, Books I-III, in 23 B.c., Horace's personal preferences and his recommendations to society at large are already fused into a credo of individualism. But certain articles of that credo appear so ill adapted to the activistic temperament of his country- men that one is led to suspect that he first found a solution for his own needs and then ineptly generalized those values into a panacea. Thus, no extrovert himself, he advocated the limitation of purpose- ful action to present needs,7 emphasized the fatuity of the acquisi- 3 Carm.

Finally, being less sensual in his en- joyments than most of his race, he recommended friendship, idyllic dolce far niente, and philosophizing in a country villa as the prime valuesl2 of our changing and uncertain existence. To accept, to refrain, and to enjoy-these are the three impera- tives which Horace enjoined upon himself and upon those of his contemporaries who believed that personal happiness was the end of living. With the first of these commands we may begin a con- sideration of the scheme of thoughtl3 which one may artificially construct from the Carmina, the Sermones and the Epistulae; but Horace himself nowhere felt the need to systematize his thoughts and might more properly have considered them as independent leitmotifs rather than as the components of a philosophy. Passive acceptance of life and whatever it may offer, whether that be good or evil, is the rational attitude of the fatalist. Fatal- ism, in its turn, is found associated, first, with theistic belief in a conscious, purposeful, and partially benevolent power or powers which predetermine all events, and secondly, with non-theistic belief either in a mechanistic sequence of cause and effect or (in unscientific minds) in cosmic forces which are unconscious and unpredictable in their operation, and entirely indifferent to human 8 See notes 45, 48, below. 9 Cf.

By means of an academic re- construction of what Horace might have thought, had he been a systematic thinker, I have arrived at a coherent sequence of ideas where none exists in the original. This is, of course, not strictly defensible, but I have considered schematization the best possible corrective to the unconscionable practice of reading Horace merely for edification and of lifting little texts and maxims out of their settings. The poet has been so long ex- cerpted by the sententious that he has become a pious sage and his thoughts have been rendered platitudinous.</page><page sequence="8">8 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL needs and prayers. In Horace the cosmic power which dispenses good and evil is called indifferently Jupiter,"4 Fortuna,"s Fate,'6 divi'7 or simply deus.'8 It is true that the power, whatever name it may bear, is often represented as a conscious Providence,'9 or, again, as a blind, if personalized, force ;20 yet it is impossible to con- clude from his terminology that Horace consistently recognized two complementary powers. It would be much nearer the truth to say that Horace the countryman and propagandist was still a polytheist21 and that Horace the reflective man was moving to- ward pantheism,2 and accepted fatalism as a valid solution of the problem of good and evil; and furthermore, that his fatalism has sometimes a theistic coloring, occasionally a non-theistic coloring. An examination of contexts and defining epithets permits of the conclusion that he is more often theistic than necessitarian in tone, and that the former type of fatalistic belief probably had more emotional validity for him at most times than the latter. Whatever the reason for this inconsistency, it has no practical 14 Carm. I, 11, 4; II, 10, 16; III, 29, 44; Iv, 4, 74; Epist. I, 18, 111 f. 16 Carm. I, 34, 15; I, 35; III, 29, 49. Carm. I, 34 may well represent a stage of belief prior to the syncretizing of Jupiter and Fortuna, for here two aspects of the Stoic world- god--supremacy and foreknowledge-are juxtaposed, but not yet predicated of one deity-or does deus in 13, which is usually taken as referring to Fortuna, indicate the composite Stoic deity? (Compare Cyril Bailey, Phases in the Religion of Ancient Rome: University of California Press [1932], 231-235, especially 234.) In this early piece the poet relates his alleged conversion from the mechanistic Epicurean view to Stoic fatal- ism. The conversion was ostensibly effected by Jupiter's hurling a bolt from the blue; but, even though Jupiter is not explicitly raised to the status of the Stoic world-god and is treated in his traditional capacity of wielder of the thunderbolt, he need not be considered ancillary to Fortuna. There is no unequivocal evidence that Horace was a pantheist. The most that one can say about his religious philosophy is that it was theis- tic and fatalistic, and that the poet, like other members of the intelligentsia, was ap- parently passing through a pre-syncretistic stage of belief. 16 Carm.

Fatalism is not only a method of accounting for the opposing elements of experience; it is also a belief that good and evil are necessary, and, as such, to be accepted. In what way did the poet propose that they be accepted by the rational individual? Since good and evil are co-existent, acceptance of life must be under- stood in a twofold sense, and, accordingly, two modes of rational conduct were proposed by Horace. Enjoyment of the present moment is the first mode of accept- ance. Since the future is unknowables2 and is only potentially good, the rational man will become an opportunist (in the best sense of the word), and will "set down as gain each day that For- tune grants";"24 that is, he will not overreach himself by indulging in ambitious hopes,25 which are realizable only in the uncertain fu- ture, if at all, but will concern himself with the immediacy of living in the present as pleasantly as he may.6 It should be added that this is not the only aspect of Horace's fatalism which furnishes a basis for hedonism. His view includes not only future contingencies in their effect upon the living, but also the ultimate event which annihilates life. Indeed, an equally powerful and equally rational motive for present enjoyment rises from his pessimistic attitude to- ward death and the after-life-an attitude which was probably not derived from mechanistic Epicurean theory, but was prevalent among those of his contemporaries27 who were unattracted by Stoic mysticism and were repelled by the vague popular belief in collective survival.28 Horace is not only aware that death is inevi- table,29 but is convinced that it is the final event in human life;30 23 Carm.

The belief in human mortality Horace reinforces in an ode to Spring (Iv, 7) by pointing out a major deviation of human nature from the</page><page sequence="10">10 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL this belief he reiterates, always with earnestness, even when he disguises his intensity by a somewhat ornamental use of outworn Greek eschatology.31 But he did not stop with personal awareness; he preached a saving doctrine to his whole generation. Neither piety nor the magic of Orpheus' song can recall the dead to life.32 Extravagant piacular offerings are no talisman against dying,33 and stark finality is in no way altered by a man's eminence, his moral worth, or his intellectual attainments.34 Death, moreover, is a leveling force which obliterates all the gradations which human society finds important.35 In fact, it cancels all the extrinsic values for which the common man lives.36 The moral of this is obvious. Since life is short at best,37 and since wealth, prestige, and personal distinction of whatsoever sort are to be nullified in the end, the rational man will not concentrate his vital energies on these il- lusory values, but will direct those energies away from future goals38 and toward immediate needs"9 and immediate pleasures, even if the immediate pleasure be pederasty40 and the immediate need be merely the racking of one's wine.4' Not only are the ener- gies conserved by being focused on the present; two positive bene- fits follow as well. The limitation of purposeful effort to everyday needs does not defer satisfaction and results in a complacency un- natural order: the renewal of earth in Spring (1-8) and the passing of the moon through its phases (13) are periodic reminders to man that he is otherwise constituted and that no rejuvenation follows senility. Horace, of course, uses the motif of collective survival purely as a poetic cliche' (see note 28, above). He does not recognize personal immortal- ity as such, only the survival of one's reputation (cf. Carm.II, 2, 5-8; II, 20; III, 30, 6- 14). This had no basis in native Roman religious practice and may have been a popular extension of the orientalizing tendency to accord deification to culture-heroes and rulers for their merits (cf. Carm. III, 3, 9-16; 5, 2-4; Iv, 8, 28-34; Epist. II, 1, 5-17). A phase in the generalizing of this pseudo-immortality may be seen, perhaps, in Carm. IIT, 2, 21-24, where caelum is vouchsafed not only to statesmen of integrity, but to all im- meritis mori. 31 Carm. I, 4, 16 f.; II, 14, 6-12; 17-20. 32 Carm. I, 24, 11-14. 33 Carm. II, 14, 5-7.

In a second, and purely negative, sense, acceptance means resignation. Here again a rational ground is supplied by fatalism. Since the fatalist believes that whatever is about to happen is inevitable, he must also be- lieve that there is no use in resisting the inevitable. He therefore declines to assert his will in attempts to mould impersonal causes to his desires, and endeavors to be content with what he now is and has." Effort is not to be expended in the futile business of self- aggrandizement,45 but is to be centered on the routine task of liv- ing from day to day, over which one has immediate control.46 Still other causes, implicit in Horace's Weltanschauung, paralyze the will to act purposefully: first, the conception of an amoral universe in which high purpose has no religious sanction and where reward and punishment are not administered in an after-life, and, second, the fact that individualism, as Horace understands it, recognizes moral obligations to others to a much less degree than the respon- sibility of personal happiness.47 But resignation in this sense, con- noting as it does retrenchment of expansive effort, simplification of the mechanics of living48 and self-interest, is not so much a 42 Carm.

On the other hand, resignation may be passive acquiescence in the evil which the ex- ternal world may impose."5 Here again the rationalist's task is to preserve his spiritual identity--in this case, from the damaging impacts of life. Since emotional poise is the chief factor contribut- ing to that identity, he will temper despair with optimism, a kind of animal faith that, "if we fare ill today, 'twill not be ever so.'"'5 But Horace is not content with a simple act of faith. He ration- alizes his belief from empiric observation of the operations of out- door nature: the fact that "though Jupiter brings back the un- lovely winters, he also takes them away" justifies his faith in the equalizing action of the law of compensation.52 In fatalism, therefore, lies the rational ground for self-limitation, with its twin ideals of present enjoyment and contentment or ac- quiescence. A technique for creating selfhood, in which enjoyment and acquiescence are the principal imperatives of living, is offered in the doctrine of the"golden mean."I The mean isa conscious mor- al check, which is to be applied primarily in order to modify na- turalistic impulses and appetites in conformance with a common- sense judgment of what constitutes rightness, propriety, or in- trinsic value, and secondarily, with the ultimate aim to create emotional poise in the individual and enable him to live a self- contained life with a minimum of emotional expenditure. Inci- dentally, Horace is not content with the Aristotelian pedigree of the mean, and corroborates this moral principle by pointing again I, 38; III, 16, 21-44 (21 f.: quanto quisque sibi plura negaverit, ab dis plura feret; 39: contracto ... cupidine); Epist. I, 1, 41-51; 2, 56: semper avarus eget: certum voto pete finem; 10, 32 f.; 17, 9 f. Simplicity to Horace usually connotes living "in accord with (outdoor) nature." This is partly of Stoic provenience, partly a rationalization made by his own romantic nature, which had its roots deep in the countryside; cf. Epist. I, 10, 12-25. 4 Serm. II, 7, 86 f.; Epist.

In its primary function, then, this rational principle is designed to mediate between extremes of spontaneous impulse, which result in human inconsistency, folly, stultification, and perversity, and which are major causes of human suffering, unhappiness and ruin.65 The via media of the rational liver will lie, to use the poet's own examples, between temerity on the one hand and cowardice on the other, between prodigality and avarice, between ostentation and miserliness.56 If Horace succeeded in impressing only the full mean- ing of this elementary principle of restraint, he still performed a great service for an aristocracy which was already rank with "rugged individualism,""7 had substituted self-interest for social responsibility to family and State,"8 and which lived no longer by the aristocratic code with its objective and corporate sanction for conduct, but by the subjective ethics of naturalism. Before we consider the secondary function of this doctrine, it is important to notice that the mean is a principle of will which is regulative of the degree of experience and is not itself a selective principle of intelligence which judges what kind of experience is good or valuable, and, furthermore, that the principle of rational- ity which empowers it to act is no higher than the common-sense judgment of what is right and wrong, valuable and not valuable, feasible and not feasible. The point may be illustrated by the norm of behavior proposed by Horace to regulate sexual appetite. It is better, he says, to seek gratification from the prostitute, who displays her charms and imperfections frankly and amid no en- tangling circumstances, than from the matron whose allure may prove to be specious and whose husband is certain to be in the of- fing.69 Nor is this choice a facetious or cynical one; on the contrary, 4 Carm. n, 10, 9-12; 15-17. 66 These commonplaces were much labored in all periods of his writing: cf., e.g., Serm. I, 2, passim; 11, 2, 53-69; 3, 82-295; 7, 6-42; 88-115; Carm. I, 18, 7-16; 27, 1-8; II, 9; Epist. I, 1, 33-61; 97-102; 2, 27-63. 68 See Serm. I, 1, 95-107; Carm. n, 10, 1-8. 67 Compare Epist.

A regulative principle of will has forbidden both the positive extreme of adultery and the negative extreme of continence,60 and an antecedent rational judg- ment has chosen the mean of venery. Yet surely the choice has been dictated by no higher judgment than the realistic common- sense judgment of which one of the two positive alternatives con- stitutes the better risk.6" In other words, the mean involves the veto power of the ethical will, presupposes only an ordinary sense of what constitutes rea- sonableness in behavior, and stops short of a genuinely intellectual criterion of values. But the recognition of this limitation should not obscure the fact that the mean was intended by Horace to function primarily as a control of the impulses of the ordinary man, not as a method of creating a superior type of individual. The poet was too sane to set up a standard for character which the conditions of the time would have made impossible of attainment. He had shrewdly seen that the nascent individualism of his day needed to learn how to refrain far more than it needed the benefits of intellectualism; accordingly, he correctly laid his emphasis on self-mastery62 and disregarded the potentialities which the critical intelligence holds for the enrichment of life. We have seen that the mean is designed to operate as a dis- ciplinary check. But Horace intended that it should also enable his individual to realize selfhood and freedom. Obviously, the ulti- mate aim of self-control will be both to harmonize the unstable impulses of the soul and to evolve a self which is detached from its own vitiating forces. Yet discipline cannot stop with the extroverted impulses. Since fatalism counsels the limitation of purposeful ac- tion, the mean must also inhibit the extravagant energies expended in the acquisitive life.63 A rigorous retrenchment of grandiose am- bitions can be expected to induce a toughness of soul, a calculated indifference regarding what the future may take away or add.64 so Compare Serm. I, 2, 111-113; 116-118. 81 Serm.

Thus, the laetus in praesens animus67 has achieved a double freedom, first, from unstable impulses and the crasser self, and, secondly, from engrossing ambitions and, by in- ference, from fear of uncertainty.68 This detached state, which is the culmination of his rationalism, Horace calls otium,69 tranquil- lity achieved through discipline. It will be seen that Horace's ideal of peace, far from being bovine contentment or stagnant com- 61 Carm. 11, 10, 13-15: sperat infestis, metuit secundis/alteram sortem bene praepara- tum/pectus. 66 Serm.

II, 16, 6-8: otium .. non gemmis neque purpura venale neque auro. For other expressions of the ideal cf. Serm. II, 7, 86 f.; Epist. I, 18, 102; 11, 7-10. Here Hor- ace somewhat romantically pictures himself sitting on a headland at Lebedus like a Lucretian sage, "the world forgetting, by the world forgot." An amplification in psy- chological terms of the ideal of philosophic detachment is furnished in Epist. I, 6, 1-16. Here the moral imperative nil admirari enjoins a modified emotional response to life and all its stimuli, in order that the psyche may exist statically self-identical and enjoy spiritual independence. Nil admirari doubtless translates Pythagoras's -rb ati 8 Oavlldfev (compare the term Oavppacrla in Strabo I, A, 3, 21). By "marveling" Horace means a state of psychological stupefaction or obsession (14), accompanied by a specific emotion (12), which results from response to a stimulus, usually an object of desire (17-23, passim). Miror is frequently used in the meaning "look at with desire"; cf, e.g., Serm. II, 7, 95-98; Carm. I, 4, 19; InI, 29, 11; Epist. I, 1, 47; 10, 31. By thus "marveling" at a stimulus outside itself the soul simultaneously forfeits its self-sufficiency and passiv- ity, experiences emotion, and enters a state of velleity or inchoate will. A blas6 disin- terestedness of the nil admirari brand may perhaps have been an attitude of the con- temporary intelligentsia: only the nalvc react instinctively to the element of the un- expected (ibidem, 9-14), while the sophisticated soul knows what to expect of life be- forehand and continues to gyrate in the limbo of quietisml</page><page sequence="16">16 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL placency, involves organic moral change, and that, as an active attempt to maintain spiritual identity in the midst of inner and outer flux, it must be considered the very core of his individualism. Peace of soul, in this sense, is the negative aspect of the poet's conception of the good life. Horace's perfect man has now liber- ated himself from subjective and objective evils, has rejected ad- ventitious values, such as wealth and prestige, which only encum- ber the self without enriching it, and is now free to pursue the only good which is organically valuable--pleasure. If it is true that the fatalistic attitude supplies a rational ground for a doctrine of enjoyment, it is also true that pleasure contains its own justification. It is possible to enjoy life simply because cer- tain sensations are pleasurable; one need not be a fatalist in order to find life pleasant. Hedonism, then, has a fundamentally sensa- tional basis, whatever the ideology by which it is justified. This basis is partially obscured by Horace, who is a thoroughgoing ra- tionalist; hedonism is represented by him as a rationalized mode of living and as the reflex of the fatalistic attitude. He does not argue that, since the present alone holds the possibility of pleasant sen- sation and since pleasant sensation is good, present enjoyment is preferable to future satisfaction, but rather, since the future is uncertain, since death is inevitable and life short at best, let us enjoy the present.70 Yet it is precisely from his norm of enjoyment that we see that Horace's hedonism is basically sensuous and aesthetic, and that it has subsequently been provided with a framework of rationalization. For the hedonic norm at least is not the expression of any rational principle, but is tacitly prescribed by the man's own temperamental preferences-his deep love of com- monplace,71 his delight in the Sabine hillside,72 the pleasure found in conviviality and friendly chatter over the wine,73 and the sen- 0o See notes 23, 26, 29, 34, 37, 42, 43, above. 71 Serm.

Venery, as well as camaraderie, was a perennial lyric theme of Horace; but his own amatory life seems to have come to an end shortly after his bohemian days (cf. Carm. III, 14, 25f.; III, 26; Iv, 1, 1-7; 29 f.; 11, 31-34).</page><page sequence="17">HORACE'S INDIVIDUALISM RECONSIDERED 17 suous enjoyment which he derives from vegetating in the coun- try.74 Even dialectic-that earnest conversation between friends, directed toward some large question-seems to be practiced in his villa mainly for its aesthetic value, not purely as a means of in- tellectual clarification.7" One is inclined to wonder how this regimen of innocuous de- lights was received by the ordinary life-loving Italian, for whom pleasure usually meant animal pleasure, and to ask whether this eminently sane man Horace was not in effect aggravating an al- ready prevalent naturalism; for the danger of generalizing a purely sensuous or even aesthetic hedonism is plain. A norm of enjoyment which should have remained personal would readily be appropri- ated and quickly degraded by the sensation-seeker; it would serve to justify in his eyes the uncritical indulgence of any passing im- pulse and to sanction expansiveness on merely instinctive and volitional levels. Criticism is not here directed at hedonism as such, but at a hedonism which is potentially naturalistic. Without a rationale of enjoyment, no moral imperatives can operate to sanction some kinds of pleasure and disallow others. It was inade- quate for the poet to set up the regulative principle of will to limit expansiveness76 and at the same time fail to invoke critical intelli- gence as an arbiter of what constitutes valuable pleasure. In fact, Horace's philosophy of life, considered in its broadest implications, may be said to represent a failure of the critical intel- ligence and a pyrrhic victory for common-sense rationalism. On the one hand, it fails to satisfy the congenital human need for self-fulfilment through purposeful action, and, on the other, suc- ceeds in showing how one may escape from life and live with a min- imum of physical effort and emotional expenditure.77 Alike 14 For vignettes of this agreeable, sun-warmed life cf. Serm. 11, 6, 60-62; Epod. ri, 1-66, passim; Carm. I, 4, 9-12; 7, 10-14; I, 38; 11, 3, 9-16; 6, 5-20; Epist. I, 10, 1-25; 14, 31-39; 18, 104-110. 75 Serm. n, 6, 70-76. Among Horace's own aesthetic pleasures the writing of poetry naturally took pride of place (cf. Carm. r, 1, 30-36; 31, 20; r, 32; 1I, 16, 38 f.; 11, 20; in, 4, 6-8; 21-36; m, 30; Iv, 3; 6, 29-44; 8, 13-34). This latter satisfaction, being de- rived from a highly technical skill, could obviously not be embodied in his generalized hedonic norm. 7a Epist. I, 2, 55. 77 For the minimizing of emotional response see note 69, above, on nil admirari.</page><page sequence="18">18 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL through fatalism and quietism the vital energies are economized, made to converge on the present, and directed toward immediate satisfaction and pleasure; but the norm of enjoyment and the criterion of value are peculiar to the poet himself and so remain entirely relative standards.7" The "golden mean," the only element of his rationalism which has universal validity, advocates moral change under the principle of the unity of thought and action: right action follows from right judgment. But the emphasis is negative: the will which implements change is the will to refrain, not the will which directs the energies to higher levels of accom- plishment. Horace's thought is humanistic in its man-centeredness. Since it is focused on the problem of personal happiness, it naturally stops short of a theory of moral obligation."7 Moreover, like humanism in other ages, it regards human intelligence as inadequate to in- terpret the external world. Accordingly, it ignores all transcen- dental and scientific problems, adopts a "defeatist" position, and proposes to submit the human will to an unknowable cosmic Will. The only forces which the human will can control will therefore be inner human forces. Hence Horace as a humanist is more immedi- ately concerned to show the relation between impulse and re- straint than to indicate a program of mental development. By the same token, we must interpret his rationalism to mean the func- tioning of the ethical will in accordance with enlightened and sane judgment and the selection of the appropriate means to a de- siderated end,81 not, as in the case of the scientific Lucretius, as intellectualism or the theory that reason is the source of knowledge. As a practical working philosophy, designed to meet the needs of the new Roman individualism, Horace's scheme must probably ?8 Horace intermittently recognized the relativity of his standard of happiness; cf. Epist. I, 14, passim, and the dictum in 44 with Epist. I, 10, 12-25 (a piece of special pleading). Cf. also Epist. I, 6, 47-68, where he (ironically) admits the diversity of possi- ble summa bona. 79 See note 47, above, ad finem. 80 Horace's favorite illustration of rationalism is an analogy. He argues that just as we all regularly use a specific medicant or cure for a given physical illness, so we should apply the lessons of philosophy as specifics for moral ills. Cf. Epist. I, 1, 28-37; 2, 33-43; 6, 28-31; II, 2, 146-157. In Epist.

In general, its values are too largely conditioned by the poet's own temperament. The tenets preached by Horace, the reflective man, are mainly the outcome of the needs and the experience of Horace, the human being. His hedonic norm, we have seen, was entirely suitable for him, but could not have been applied as a universal standard. The ideal of quietism especially is clearly a rationalization of a mode of life imposed both by the requirements of a retiring temperament and by a modest income;81 to have generalized it into a panacea for his activistic countrymen82 was inept. This humanitarian poet doubtless felt it his duty to offer an ideal to a society which was cut off from the sources of the spirit and was becoming increasingly bourgeois in its preoccupations, but to confront it with the ideal of static self- hood, to substitute aesthetic values for materialistic objectives, and to expect the common man to reject the only things which have obvious value for him was futile and unrealistic. An individu- alism which proposes to stabilize life at the expense of devaluating it is not dynamic. It involves no straining toward superiority, no heightening of human potentialities. The crux of the matter is that Horace, an introvert, sought to influence an extrovert society. The inner simplification of human nature, the partial detaching of one's identity from the texture of life, and the raising of the soul above evil, if not above good-this ideal of the good life must necessarily have found little acceptance, and it will continue to find little ac- ceptance so long as the race is conditioned by nature to lead the extrovert life. 8 81 See note 48, above, ad finem, and Serm. I, 6, 93-131, passim. Cf. also Carm. iu' 15 (a rationalization of his resentment at the progressive urbanization and prettifying of the countryside), and Epist. I, 15, 42-46: tuta et parvola laudo cum res deficiunt (a good-natured admission that plain living and high thinking are frequently enforced by necessity and subsequently rationalized into virtues). 82 Epist. I, 11, 25-30 (compare especially 28: strenua nos exercet inertia). 83 It has been said that every major philosophical attitude is represented in every age. Certainly the "defeatist" position is as prevalent today in popular philosophy as it was in antiquity. The nihilistic quietism of John Cowper Powys may be instanced (cf., e.g. his book A Philosophy of Solitude: New York, Simon and Schuster [1933]); but Mr. Powys is considerably more tough-minded and intense in the preaching of his gospel than the easy-going and frequently sentimental Horace.</page></plain_text>
