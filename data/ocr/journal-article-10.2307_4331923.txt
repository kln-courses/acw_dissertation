Darwin proclaimed his own work revolutionary. His revolution, however, is still in progress, and the changes that are going on are reflected in the contemporary historical and philosophical literature, including that written by scientists. The changes have taken place at different levels, and have tended to occur at the more superficial ones. The new ontology that arose as a consequence of the realization that species are individuals at once provides an analytical tool for explaining what has been happening and an example of the kind of changes that seem in order. It provides a clear distinction between the roles of history and of laws of nature. Pre-Darwinian "evolution" was superficial in the sense that it treated change as either as something pre-ordained or else due to timeless laws of nature, rather than historical contingency. Darwinism puts the ontological emphasis upon concrete, particular things (individuals) and therefore del- egitimizes both essentialistic and teleological ways of thinking. However, traditional ways of thinking have persisted, if not explicitly, then often as assumptions and pro- cedures that are merely implicit or even unconscious. As a result, anti-evolutionary attitudes continue to influence the practice of evolutionary biology as well as the study of its history and philosophy. Keywords: contingency, Darwinian revolution, essentialism, individuality, Scala naturae, teleology, typology Introduction From many years of experience I have learned that the best way to master a branch of knowledge is to do some original research in it. The understanding so gained provides a deeper understanding of the fun- damentals than does just reading, talking, and writing about it. Although I am a comparative invertebrate anatomist by doctoral dissertation, I have done a great deal of historical or quasi-historical work on the origin and assimilation of Darwinism, of which my first book, The Triumph of the Darwinian Method, is the best-known example.' In philosophy, my main accomplishment (for which I gladly share credit with David Hull) ' Ghiselin, 1969a.</page><page sequence="2">124 MICHAEL T. GHISELIN has been the proposal and elaboration of the thesis that species are individuals, the revolutionary implications of which are becoming widely begrudged.2 Historians and philosophers however are largely unaware of my contributions to Darwinian evolutionary biology, such as the mod- ern theory of sex-switches.3 The fact that the historical, philosophical, and more strictly scientific aspects of my work have been mutually supporting is therefore not always obvious. This essay shows how the new ontology can help us to understand the Darwinian revolution. However, no attempt is made to justify that ontology, except insofar as it has explanatory value for the topics under consideration. Because this is an effort to show the consequence of a point of view, documentation has been kept to a minimum, and differences of opinion with others have been stated mainly in the form of generalities. The concept of a scientific revolution emerged gradually. For a long time it was applied almost exclusively by commentators discussing past accomplishments, rather than by the scientific revolutionaries them- selves. Indeed, the first important one to characterize his work as such was Lavoisier - a victim of a political revolution that happened at around the same time.4 From Darwin's notebooks it is obvious that he was quite conscious of the revolutionary character of his evolutionary thinking, especially its philosophical significance. At the end of the Origin of Species he compared his accomplishment to that of Newton - after, we must emphasize, remarking "6we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history" and then laying out his vision of the future.5 Even though the crucial breakthrough that resulted from reading Malthus would seem to have come to him in a moment, the Origin was the product of some 20 years of study and reflection. We know that he only gradually abandoned the old ways of thinking and replaced them with the new. Saltations are equally illusory whether we are dealing with intellectual or organic evolution.6 We can only expect Darwin's con- temporaries (and ours) to have been even slower in coming to grips with evolutionary reality. We are not just reflecting upon the Darwinian Revolution, we are experiencing it. The layperson's travesty of evolution has been that man is descended from an ape: it has not changed much since Darwin's day. The twen- tieth-century historian's travesty of evolution has been that although the 2 Ghiselin, 1974a, 1997, 2002a. 3 Ghiselin, 1969b. 4 Cohen, 1985, pp. 229-230.

Both of these travesties are at once closer to reality and farther from reality than one might think. Man is not just descended from an ape; if the word "ape" has any scientific meaning then man is an ape. As to the acceptance of evolution, it is more than problematic how much of what was considered "evo- lution" in the nineteenth century would be called that by a modern evolutionary biologist. As to the acceptance of natural selection, it was of course a minority position, but as I have said elsewhere there has been considerable hyperbole with respect to Darwin's contemporaries.7 There were some important contributors to the theory of natural selection, most of whom worked on invertebrates and plants: Wallace, of course, but also Fritz Muller and his brother Hermann, Henry Walter Bates, George John Romanes and August Weismann. A larger number of scientists under- stood and appreciated natural selection well enough that the theory had a significant effect on their choice of research projects and their results. Anton Dohrn, for example, shifted his research program from terrestrial to marine arthropods even before he invented the principle of the suc- cession of functions.8 The Darwinian faction can be further enlarged by having it encompass scientists who accepted natural selection but whose research was not significantly affected by it, irrespective of how well they really understood it. Even the notion that natural selection was accepted by the 1950s, although true, is misleading, as is evident when we con- sider the rejection of species-level advantages and the consequent renaissance of sexual selection in the late 1960s.9 Accepting evolution is one thing, learning to think like an evolu- tionist and to frame appropriate historical questions about real organ- isms and concrete populations is another. Likewise, admitting that natural selection exists is not the same thing as framing one's evolu- tionary questions in terms of differential reproductive success. The problem of intellectual retooling is particularly difficult because the old assumptions and ways of thinking often persist, whether explicitly, implicitly, or unconsciously, as a part of intellectual tradition. A great deal of that which is implicit or unconscious is there because it is taken over uncritically, perhaps from every day life, perhaps from what we have been taught in school, perhaps through indoctrination as a grad- uate student. Or what may be appropriate to some other branch of knowledge is transferred to evolutionary biology without any 7 Ghiselin, 2001. 8 Ghiselin, 1994. 9 Ghiselin, 1969a, 1969b.</page><page sequence="4">126 MICHAEL T. GHISELIN consideration of whether it may be inappropriate in the new context. The less we are aware of what goes into our reasoning, the less apt we are to question its validity and to seek alternatives. Such considerations suggest that Darwinism can be understood at various levels, and accordingly that the Darwinian Revolution itself likewise took place, is taking place, and may yet take place, at various levels. Change, understanding, and accommodation range all the way from the utterly superficial to the altogether profound. Change within certain limits, perhaps in adaptation to local circumstance is one thing. Ines- sential characters come and go. Essential ones would have to be a dif- ferent matter. To allow for change to be indefinite, and sufficient to permit the origin of new species, implies that we may need to rethink some of our fundamental metaphysical assumptions. Maybe species do not have essences. Pre-Darwinians conceived of change as something superficial, and in that sense they did not treat it as real. This is clear from the way in which they attempted to relate organic evolution to the kinds of change with which they were already familiar. If the world was created, then it had pre-existed in the Mind of the Creator and therefore evolution was the unfolding of something that already existed but had not yet been realized. Alternatively, the laws of nature, ordained by the same Per- sonage, brought living beings into existence through secondary causes. Therefore, two "models" for evolutionary change were available. The first was ontogeny, or the development of an embryo. The second was the formation of a crystal as the result of timeless and eternal (albeit divinely ordained) laws of nature. In either case, it was not a matter of something coming into being that was ontologically new. Rather, it was the actualizing of a potentiality. These "models" continue to be evoked by scientists and philosophers alike. Genealogical classification as advocated and practiced by Darwin is strictly historical, and ontologically real common ancestors, in other words not abstractions but concrete particular things, determine the composition of the groups. Biology, like astronomy, is an historical science that works with both contingent events and laws of nature. An explanatory historical narrative therefore becomes the ultimate form of knowledge. Of course, such narratives refer not just to concrete par- ticulars, but also to abstract generalizations about nature's uniformities. But the Darwinian Revolution necessitated a serious reconsideration of the significance of those uniformities. Darwin's predecessors had grossly overestimated the extent to which laws of nature might account for the observed phenomena, or, what is much the same thing, they had underestimated the amount of historical contingency that is necessary to</page><page sequence="5">A PHILOSOPHICAL BIOLOGIST'S VIEW 127 provide a proper scientific account of this world. In Darwinism, history is not an epiphenomenon: it is the fundamental reality. Expanding upon that line of thought, we can treat the reality of change as a more particular case of what I like to call the priority of the concrete over the abstract. So far as metaphysics goes, it was an intel- lectual revolution of the first magnitude. Much as Copernicus had moved the sun to the center of the physical world, Darwin moved concrete particular things to the center of the metaphysical world. Individuals, not classes, were the ultimate reality: the individual organisms that struggle for existence and also the individual species that speciate and are transformed through time. In taxonomy, this change in perspective has often been explicated in terms of the rejection of essentialism, and that is surely a part of it. Taxonomic groups are individuals and individuals have neither the essences nor the intellectual baggage that goes with them. Their component organisms are also individuals and the fact that it is they that differ from one another and reproduce differentially means that they play a crucial role in evolu- tionary processes. Variation is not deviation from a norm, but a reflection of the underlying causality. Of course, the uproar over the Origin was largely about its impli- cations for religion. That helps to explain why it was so repugnant to theists and so attractive to atheists, and also why so much effort was expended upon trying to reconcile Darwinism with traditional beliefs. The kind of natural theology that had impressed Darwin in his college days ceased to be taken seriously by scientists. But far more was at stake than whether a creation myth was to be taken literally, or figuratively, or perhaps abandoned outright. God was not just being dismissed as an unnecessary hypothesis: there was no longer any justification for rea- soning from assumptions as to His nature, irrespective of whether one granted His existence. I call this feature of the Darwinian Revolution the delegitimizing of theosophy. To the more perceptive intellects at least it was obvious that Darwin was, as Kant had put it, the Newton of the grass-blade and that tele- ology was a metaphysical delusion. Nonetheless that very teleology was a special case of a yet more pervasive anthropomorphism. Pre-Dar- winian science had presupposed that, one way or another, the physical universe had been brought into being by God. To what extent the work had been done by His Fiat, by the ministrations of angels, or by the laws of nature was of course debatable. Scientists, following Hume, had agreed that miracles have no place in science, for by definition miracles are events that happen contrary to the laws of nature, which are all that science can deal with. But rejecting miracles was just a matter of</page><page sequence="6">128 MICHAEL T. GHISELIN demarcation, or a criterion for telling us what kinds of questions science can and cannot answer. Darwinism ruled out all such a priori assumptions toto caelo. Not only could one no longer assume that the Creator had created the universe, one could no longer reason as if it had been so created, for example by treating teleology as a Kantian regu- lative principle. The same stricture applied to the laws of nature that supposedly govern the universe, for it could no longer be presupposed that the Creator was also the Divine Legislator. As the philosopher William Whewell explained quite well, that very assumption underlay the various forms of idealism that seemed quite reasonable to him and many other persons just before the Darwinian Revolution.'0 Episte- mologically, therefore, the Darwinian ontology called for a radical empiricism, albeit a sophisticated one. One way or another, claims about the natural world had to be justified on a strictly experiential basis. That includes the metaphysics, and on that basis we are justified in considering metaphysics itself a natural science. As is common knowledge, Darwin demolished the traditional "argument from design." On the face of it this is because Darwin provided a strictly mechanistic explanation for the facts of adaptation. Merely admitting, however, that natural selection explains adaptation did not suffice to get rid of teleology. Having God effect His Will by means of natural selection was a somewhat deeper-level accommoda- tion. Naturally there were some efforts at superficial accommodation, the most interesting one perhaps that of Asa Gray, who devised what John Dewey called "Design on the installment plan."''l God nudged things so that they changed along pre-ordained lines. But even those who deny His existence have often failed to reorganize their thinking and have merely put natural selection in His place. Darwinism explains the properties of living beings as the conse- quence of reproductive competition between individuals, especially organisms but also such individuals as families. Organisms have the properties that they do because they repeat that which, in the long run and for the most part, has given their ancestors an edge in that com- petition. Adaptation is a process, and adaptations are the products of that process. Consequently, in Darwinian biology adaptation state- ments are (implicit or explicit) historical narratives: they explain the data in terms of particular events and the relevant laws of nature. Apart from the historical evidence, there is no legitimate scientific justification for them. In my youth it was common practice to attribute many '? Whewell, 1853. " Dewey, 1910.</page><page sequence="7">A PHILOSOPHICAL BIOLOGIST'S VIEW 129 properties of organisms to the "good of the species" but of course that was contrary to the relevant laws of nature. The somewhat later notion that organisms exist "for the sake of their genes" is another example of the persistence of such pre-Darwinian thought habits. Victorian moral sentiments were outraged when Darwin suggested, in The Descent of Man, that if "men were raised under precisely the same conditions as hive-bees, there can hardly be a doubt that our unmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty to kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile daughters; and no one would think of interfering."'2 The message here was that what has sometimes been called "naturalistic ethics" is an exercise in futility, as has been born out by all such efforts ever since. There is no way in which an "ought" can be justified by an "is" once the teleological assumptions that underlie such efforts have been rejected. Whatever is is trite. But efforts along such lines have been pervasive, and it is obvious that the teleology is still being presupposed, as it is in other contexts, perhaps without the proponents even being aware of what they are doing. The delegitimizing of theosophy implies that teleology must be rejected categorically. We must not even reason as if the world were the reflection of Divine Providence or anything that even remotely resembles it. That follows from Darwinian ontology, but the problem of teleology is largely an epistemological one.13 Teleology is a fallacious way of reasoning. Much of the philosophical literature on teleology is nugatory because it completely misses that point. Philosophers are often misled because of their obsession with words, and consequently fail to understand the propositions that the words are intended to convey. The problem is exacerbated because biologists often talk like laypersons, whose thinking really is teleological. They may excuse themselves by saying that such language is metaphorical, or just a figure of speech. But given that the thought processes may not be explicit, and indeed may even be unconscious, how do we know that, at some level, the metaphor has not been reified? And will our audience be able to avoid misinterpretation? The other excuse for what is loosely called teleology is its supposed "heuristic value." According to this notion, pretending that the world was created by some omnipotent and prescient Being is useful in fig- uring what things do and how they work. There are two obvious answers to this argument. First, granted that it may help to suggest hypotheses, that is no excuse for not doing one's job as a scientist and 12Darwin, 1871, Vol. 1, p. 73. 13 Ghiselin, 2002b. Critics of my views on teleology generally ignore my book about it (Ghiselin, 1974b).</page><page sequence="8">130 MICHAEL T. GHISELIN searching for alternative hypotheses and testing them. Second, why not do the job right in the first place, and conduct the investigation as an exercise in historical reconstruction? In other words, instead of asking what God might have done, ask what might have happened to real organisms in the real world.'4 The scala naturae or great chain of being is part of the intellectual Kitsch that has come down to us from antiquity. Like teleology, it can be attributed to the kind of anthropomorphism that characterizes so much of pre-scientific intellectual life. In Baroque times it was explicitly developed as a system of correspondences between the human body, the universe as a whole, and the mind of God. Everything could be arranged in a single series from lower to higher. That conception underlay Lamarck's approach to taxonomy. It was also integral to Lamarck's notion of progress: a law of nature necessitated that animals would evolve so as to become increasingly like man, unless something inter- fered. There was an implicit theosophical assumption driving Lamarck's thinking. When Darwin revolutionized taxonomy he replaced the figure of a ladder with that of a tree, emphasizing diversification as a result of economic forces, and consigning anthropomorphism to the rubbish heap. Likewise with his conception of progress: it was a contingent manner within the context of a truly historical view of life.15 There has been much discussion on the persistence of the scala naturae, and its pernicious effects on the writing of textbooks, the design of cur- ricula, and governmental policy are almost too obvious to deserve com- ment. What is not so obvious is the extent to which this is a projection of the anti-evolutionism that pervades intellectual culture. The Lamarckian conception of higher and lower was based on the primitive (by our standards) physiological conceptions of his day. He was trying to ape the physical sciences. Darwin's diversity model was a based upon a theory about the competitive natural economy. It was the product of a new way of thinking that might have reordered our priorities. A more interesting question is the extent to which the scala naturae as an assumption that is implicit rather than explicit, or even is unconscious, distorts the thinking of people who ought to know better. Historians often praise Lamarck for introducing the word "invertebrate" into scientific discourse. The rejection of typology, or essentialism, has often been treated as one of the most important features of the Darwinian Revolution. However the essences of "essentialism" that are invoked by its critics all too often reveal that essentialism has been dealt with only at a very 14 Ghiselin, 1974b. 15 Ghiselin, 1997.</page><page sequence="9">A PHILOSOPHICAL BIOLOGIST'S VIEW 131 superficial level. The priority of the concrete implies that what is causally important is particular things, not abstractions. That does imply that individual organisms are important, and that when dealing with evolutionary problems we must not screen out variation or think of groups in terms of stereotypes. The delegitimizing of theosophy also implies that essences shall not be treated as ideas in the mind of God of which individuals are imperfect copies. But merely granting those two concessions does not mean that we cleaned up our metaphysical act. One can easily do lip-service to the problem by asserting that essences are immanent rather than transcendent while all the time conducting one's life as if nothing had changed. And emphasizing organisms and their variations is by no means enough. It is largely because The Organism has always functioned as the Platonic Idea of The Individual that scientists and philosophers alike have had so much trouble coming to grip with the fact that biological species are individuals rather than classes. People have a hard time conceptualizing populations as concrete particular things, and for that very reason they are apt to treat them like the extensional sets that often go by the same name. Mayr's seminal essay on population thinking turns out to have had a somewhat per- nicious effect for that very reason.'16 As long as one grants the impor- tance of variability, one is not a typologist! One superficial way of accommodating variability and change was to treat the essence of essentialism as if it were a matter of how classes ought to be defined. Supposedly, Scholastic notions about definition in terms of necessary and sufficient defining properties could be replaced by more "Wittgensteinian" notions of family resemblances, disjunctive or polythetic definitions, fuzzy sets, or whatever. But there is no reason why a Platonic Idea cannot be conceptualized as somewhat elastic, fuzzy, or even muddled. A timeless and eternal pattern can still be assumed to underlie appearances. Both the distinction between essential and accidental characters and the notion that the essential limits cannot be passed are unaffected. Although the problem of essentialism in the thinking of pre-Darwinian biologists needs to be re-examined, the question is not whether or these people were essentialists, but rather what role essences played in their thinking.'7 A more recent maneuver has been to shift to another kind of essentialism, and treat biological taxa as if they were natural kinds, like the elements in the periodic table, which owe their properties to laws of nature. In other words, play Kripke instead of Wittgenstein. 16 Mayr, 1959. 17 Winsor, 2003.</page><page sequence="10">132 MICHAEL T. GHISELIN The branch of biology in which essentialism has been most explicit, and I dare say flagrant, is morphology.'8 Idealistic morphology might even be defined as a search for Platonic Ideas in biological materials. The underlying metaphysics again need not be explicit or even con- scious. As long as one is seeking for timeless, eternal patterns rather than real history amidst the road-kills of paleontology one is not operating within the philosophical framework of Darwinism. Mor- phology has been somewhat modernized by the adoption of cladistic techniques and new materials such as sequence data. However, many who have embraced cladism are retread typologists who continue to think as if only the algorithms had changed. One wonders why they continue to use the nomenclature of eighteenth century occult meta- physics rather than modern science. Why do they talk about Baupidne, instead of anatomical diagrams? Why do they talk about archetypes, rather than common ancestors? Why do they say that synapomorphies define groups, rather than diagnose them? Those are just symptoms of course, and we need hard data to find out to what extent the outdated ways of thinking are actually operative. It could of course be just a matter of old words taking on new meaning. It happens that Stephen Jay Gould's last book, The Structure of Evo- lutionary Theory, provides an excellent example of the continuing influence of essentialism. The book, which I have reviewed in depth already, is a long one, but that has some advantages.'9 The author explains his reasoning at great length, and the philosophy is explicit enough that it is accessible to criticism. My paper entitled "A radical solution to the species problem" first drew the attention of the scientific community to the fact that biological species are individuals, not classes.20 They are historical entities or concrete particular things, with a beginning and an end, and not time- less abstractions. Upon reading that paper Niles Eldredge realized that species, like organisms, might reproduce differentially with long-term consequences. That possibility of selection at higher levels of integration led him and Gould to elaborate upon the possible role of species selection as a macroevolutionary mechanism. Gould treated the indi- viduality of species as the philosophical justification for that effort. However, he was unable to give up his longstanding infatuation with idealistic morphology, which he identified with what he called "struc- turalism." He tried to make essences be not transcendent, but imma- nent, by incarnating them in the genome. In effect, he confused what are 18 Ghiselin, 1980; Breidbach and Ghiselin, 2002. 19 Gould, 2002; Ghiselin, 2002c. 20 Ghiselin, 1974a.</page><page sequence="11">A PHILOSOPHICAL BIOLOGIST'S VIEW 133 often called "conservative characters" or ones that evolve very slowly and perhaps for a while not at all, with ones that are unrestricted with respect to space or time. The problem is that genomes are individuals, and every bit as historical as their phenotypic expressions are. It is ironic that in an earlier book, Wonderful Life, Gould made a strong case for historical contingency in macroevolution.21 He was unable to carry that line of reasoning to its logical conclusion: life is history all the way down. Evolutionary biology is an historical science. But what does it really mean, when we say that a science, or science in general, is historical? And what is science? So far as the Darwinian Revolution is concerned, we must reject the traditional philosophical notion that science is about classes rather than individuals. Science deals with both laws of nature and particular material bodies, events, and other individuals. It has both its nomothetic and its idiographic aspects. The relationship is reason- ably straightforward with respect to physics and astronomy. There is no good reason for denying that astronomy, plate tectonics, paleontology, genomics, or the study of the history of evolutionary theory are sciences. There are of course bad reasons, including the tradition of dissociating the philosophy of science from objective reality. Who cares whether Martian tigers are grue? Philosophy has been saddled with a tradition of anti-evolutionism. Such anti-evolutionism is but a more particular symptom of a pervasive antipathy to history in general. That philo- sophical attitude has militated against the proper appreciation of his- tory not just by philosophers, but also by scientists themselves, and, although it may seem paradoxical, by historians. The tradition within philosophy has been to presuppose the legiti- macy of its own perspective and assumptions, and if it has anything to do with science, to legislate to it, rather than to grapple with it on its own merits. Consequently, philosophical puzzles in science have habitually been treated at a very superficial level, by applying whatever intellectual technology happens to be available and would seem to do the trick. A more enterprising approach that involves real creativity upon the part of philosophers has to involve a deeper understanding of the science itself than is easy to come by or generally deemed worth the time. The history of the philosophy of biology during the last half of the twentieth century provides some good examples of how this can be accomplished and also of how difficult it can be. A yet deeper engage- ment with science might involve testing the philosophy against what a 21 Gould, 1989.</page><page sequence="12">134 MICHAEL T. GH1SELIN scientist would call hard data, and gaining something from the experi- ence that might engender substantive changes in philosophy itself. When scientists themselves have philosophical arguments it all too often is more a matter of winning points in academic power struggles than addressing the substantive issues or gaining practical wisdom. Such motivation militates against importing any but the most superficial of philosophical notions and often results in not getting them straight. So long as the "philosophy of science" remains anti-evolutionary evolu- tionary biologists will have little to gain from it. And should they have something to offer in return it will probably fall upon deaf ears. The history of science is another matter. Evolutionary biologists do have something to offer in return. For one thing, paleontology, biogeogra- phy, and many other biological disciplines are truly historical sciences, and the history of such disciplines can provide a valuable contribution that might counteract the pervading antipathy toward history in gen- eral. For another, the practitioner of one historical discipline should be able to transfer conceptual skills to other areas of experience. Scientists often are seriously interested in the history of their subjects, and for very good reasons, not the least of which is the kind of scholarship that grades into history proper. On the other hand much of the historical literature has also been produced within the context of academic power struggles. It needs to be treated with the same kind of critical under- standing that is applied to literature based upon what goes on in the laboratory and the field. Many biologists have presupposed the kind of anti-evolutionary attitude that has so long pervaded the "philosophy of science" when discussing the history of their subject. The historiography of embryology is particularly untrustworthy. Many professional historians share the kind of antipathy toward history that pervades the "philosophy of science" and therefore it is not paradoxical for them to endorse the kind of anti-evolutionism that is all too common among those biologists who oppose the Darwinian revo- lution. Accepting the notion that history is not science, they treat it as if it were a branch of imaginative literature, and relegate the practitioners of the historical sciences to the inferior status that they have accepted for themselves. Under such circumstances it is easy to understand why historians have had such limited success in dealing with topics that are intrinsically historical. One great vice of historians has been to treat the past in terms of the past, and not to see what has been going on as part of an ongoing process. The errors of the eighteenth century have been used to misin- terpret the accomplishments of the nineteenth century, and thereby to sabotage research in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. How easy</page><page sequence="13">A PHILOSOPHICAL BIOLOGIST'S VIEW 135 it has been to find similarities, however remote, between Darwin's work and that of his predecessors and then proclaim a virtual identity! It is as if nothing interesting had happened to us vertebrates since the days when our Paleozoic forbears first began to venture forth upon the land. When dealing with the Darwinian Revolution we must not fall into the same trap and pretend that it was something that happened in the nineteenth century, or even that it really did not happen until the middle of the twentieth century. Again, the revolution is work in progress, and something that is going on here and now. We are in no position to specify how profound such changes might be. Conclusion Although the Darwinian revolution is an individual, and therefore has no intensional definition, revolution in general or in the abstract is quite another matter. We need a classification of revolutions and similar entities consisting of natural kinds that correspond to the laws of nature that apply to such individuals. In that connection I note a few thoughts that have come to mind. Revolutions should not be confused with breakthroughs or noteworthy discoveries. The Synthetic Theory was not a revolution. It was a restoration. My own work on sex-changes is a case in point. It stimulated a great deal of research on that topic, but it was a straight-forward synthesis of Darwin's ideas on sexual selection with those of Bernhard Rensch on body size. It contributed to the demise of group selection, but that simply eliminated an alternative within the tradition in which I was working. As to my insight that species are individuals, it originated as nothing more than an effort to correct some logical mistakes that were made by systematists. Only when it encountered serious opposition from professional philosophers did it begin to seem revolutionary. From the point of view of evolu- tionary biology, it is a straightforward incorporation of ontological theory into the more or less orthodox Darwinian view of life. From the point of view of philosophy, however, the situation is quite different, for that very ontology poses a serious challenge to the kind of philosophy of science that dominated for most of the twentieth century.
