<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS James A. Kelso, 1873-15^51 We regret to report the death, on No- vember 3, 1951, of James A. Kelso, president emeritus of Western Theolog- ical Seminary, Pittsburgh, Pennsylva- nia, a member and former officer of the Pittsburgh Society of the Archaeo- logical Institute of America, and a lifelong student of the archaeology of Palestine. In Dr. Kelso's obituary, the meticu- lous New York Times published a biog- raphy which hopelessly confused the professional careers of James A. Kelso and James L. Kelso. By a chain of coincidences, James A. Kelso and James L. Kelso both were ordained Presbyterian ministers; both taught at Presbyterian theological seminaries in Pittsburgh's North Side, James Ander- son at Western, James Leon at Pitts- burgh-Xenia, which face each other across a small park; both taught the same subjects; both were members of the A. I. A. and the American Orien- tal Society; both were active in support of the American School of Oriental Re- search in Jerusalem. Their academic neighbors at Pittsburgh distinguished them irreverently as Western Kelso and Xenia Kelso. But they were not related. James L. Kelso, who in a letter of December 3 affirmed his continued good health, was director of the Jeru- salem School in 1949-50 and president of the Board of Trustees of the Pales- tine Archaeological Museum, and wrote for Archaeology an account of the museum which appeared in Volume 3, Part 2 (Summer 1950), pages 66-68. His description of his work at Jericho, illustrated with his own excellent pho- tographs of actual excavation scenes, appeared in the December 1951 number of the National Geographic Magazine ('Ghosts of Jericho,' pages 825-844). Cairo Center Newsletter Number Three of the American Research Center in Egypt transcribes a long letter from the pres- ent director, William Stevenson Smith, giving the news up to a date in October. We quote one paragraph of particular interest: "I have succeeded in completing tracings of a large series of fragmen- tary blocks which once decorated the temple of King Weserkaf, the first king of Dynasty V in the Old King- dom. Although terribly smashed, these constitute the earliest body of royal re- liefs of any size and it has been pos- sible to reconstruct an amusing scene of men energetically paddling a large boat. Each group of men works in rhythm, some raising their paddles high in the air and others leaning far down over the side of the boat in an unusual example of arrested move- ment. There is also a charming exam- ple of a rare scene of bird snaring in an orchard which can be put together from various fragments. One block turned out not to belong to Weserkaf at all and provides us with the name of a Queen Khent-kaw-s. She may prove to be a second lady of this name and not the much-discussed builder of the so-called 'Fourth Pyramid' at Giza as I had at first thought. Even more curious are two other 'blocks which one would have taken to be typically Old Kingdom in style but which show the famous son of Rames- ses II, Prince Kha-m-waset. He is known to have taken a particular in- terest in the Saqqara Cemetery and we seem to have here a most intriguing example of alterations made to a tem- ple built some twelve hundred years earlier than the time in which the prince lived. Such an early example of 'archaeological' interest is in keeping with stories about Kha-m-waset. Jean- Phillipe Lauer, the Government Ar- chitect at Saqqara, is completing the study of the Weserkaf Temple which was begun long ago by Cecil Firth in 1928. It is hoped that the drawings of the reliefs can be employed in a publi- cation by the Antiquities Department of this valuable material." In addition to his other obligations, Mr. Smith has undertaken the editor- ship of the 'Near East Archaeological News' for the American Journal of Archaeology. He also attended the International Congress of Orientalists in Istanbul in September: "There were two weeks before the Congress and a few days afterwards in which to see again most of my Turkish friends and to enjoy at leisure the many fascinating things to be seen in Istanbul. I should particularly like to acknowledge the courtesy of Bay Aziz Ogan, the Director of the Archaeo- logical Museum, who showed me the alterations which he is making in that building. The old wooden roof is be- ing replaced by fire-proof materials and the small objects on the vast upper floor must now all be put back in place. Structural repairs are also being undertaken in the Cinili Kiosk which is to be made into a museum devoted to the time of its builder, Mohammed the Conqueror. The other small build- ing across the courtyard contains the collections of the Ancient Orient brought here from sites the mere names of which cast a certain spell from the romantic days of early ar- chaeology: Carchemish, Boghazköy, Assur, Babylon, Nippur, Telloh. Surely it would be hard to find such a picturesque cluster of museum build- ings laid as they are about a courtyard terrace above the old trees of the pal- ace gardens which fall away to the Golden Horn. Ancient stones have been casually arranged amongst trees and shrubbery. The sunlight flashes back from the bright tiles of the Cin- ili Kiosk contrasting with the sombre masses of porphyry imperial sarco- phagi, while dark basalt Hittite lions stare stonily at the fantastic tree forms of Byzantine columns. It is this court- yard which really prepares the visitor for the strangely impelling beauty of the justly famous 'Alexander Sarco- phagus.' " M. A. A .

Bank, II, has written from Ann Arbor as of November 27, 1951, concerning the University of Michigan expedition to the Aleutian Is- lands, of which he is field director: The University of Michigan has sponsored for the past four years a continuous program of anthropologi- cal and botanical field work in the Aleutians. Beginning in 1948, the project has been co-sponsored by the Office of Naval Research and the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project. Associated, aside from the writer, who acted as leader, have been A. C. Spaulding, J. F. Bank, W. R. Hurt, H. A. Miller, D. S. McClain and L. H. Jordal. Field investigations were undertaken on more than twenty Aleutian islands and in five Aleut villages. Major archae- ological excavations were completed at Agattu and Unalaska, and in addition most of the known Aleut burial caves were revisited for excavation of levels below those previously sampled by Dall, Jochelson and Hrdlička. A number of interesting correlations between anthropological and botanical data have resulted. Phytoecological studies of prehistoric village sites in- dicate a close correlation between for- mer Aleut plant uses and present day vegetation and a possible correlation be- tween the latter and age since abandon- ment of such sites. Ethnobotanical stud- ies have shown the old Aleut plant lore to be more extensive and important to Aleut culture than has previously been supposed. At Unalaska, two deep sites separated by only a few miles of water produced artifacts which appear to be representative of different cultures. Aside from botanical and archaeo- logical studies, the expeditions com- pleted ethnological studies in the pres- ent day villages. Medical and economic data are available for a close analysis of the trends of Aleut acculturation. Plant, animal, and place names fully annotated with actual Aleut names pro- vide a basis for linguistic comparisons among the various Aleut dialects and between Aleut and Eskimo. The 1951 expedition returned to Ann Arbor only a few weeks ago. Material is being studied at the University of Michigan and by specialists at other in- stitutions. Ethnobotanical samples are being dated by the University of Michi- gan radiocarbon laboratory. Kramer to Turkey Samuel Noah Kramer, professor of Assyriology at the University of Pennsylvania, received a Fulbright award for research in Turkey and is now at Istanbul, where he is collating clay tablets and fragments, in the Su- merian script and language, found at Nippur a half-century ago by a Uni- versity of Pennsylvania expedition. $ 4 ý Y y The Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies y v -Ô» ^ President : Professor T.

Life in a Rain Forest Described by its creators as a land- mark in the progress of museum display techniques, the American Museum of Natural History's exhibition of "Men of the Montana; a story of life in the Peruvian rain-forest," was opened on November 28, 1951. In this first major showing in the United States of ethnological material from the Amazon, full use is made of lighting, color, sound, and careful selec- tion and arrangement of the materials, to enhance the effect of the culture of the area. The nucleus of the exhibition is the collection, numbering several thousand items, assembled by Raul de los Rios during a twenty-five-year resi- dence on the eastern slopes of the An- des, and obtained for the museum by the late Francis Adams Truslow. Among the unusual techniques em- ployed are the use of free-standing fig- ures placed in open jungle settings cre- ated of actual liana vines brought from Peru. At one end of the hall a fisherman on the beach at the edge of the jungle mends his net, while among the tangled vines and tropical foliage of the other jungle setting a warrior, bow and arrow in hand, stalks his enemy. Headhunting, fishing, farming, hunt- ing, weaving, and the ceremonial rites of the Indians who inhabit this inac- cessible area on the upper Amazon are depicted against a stylized simulation of the Montana. Figures, designed in the manner of fashion mannequins, rep- resent the activities peculiar to these natives. A Yagua man shoots a blow- gun, while a Conibo man and woman, both dressed in full ceremonial costume, are shown ladling beer from a large earthenware pot into a drinking gourd. The use of sound as a display tech- nique is unique in that this is the first time the sounds of a region have been represented naturally. Peepers and tree frogs, giant frogs and howler monkeys announce the impending rain in a wild cacophony. Sounds of other animals are heard in a minor key while it is raining very hard. When the rain recedes, the visitor hears the thunderous crash of falling branches which startle the ani- mals and provoke the screaming of monkeys and squawking of macaws. The plaintive cry of the bell-bird, the melodic coloratura of the toucans, the conversational calls of the crested guans, and the eerie wail of the howler monkeys are part of the fusion of sounds that pervade the hall. With the co-operation of Moses Asch of Ethnic Folkways Records, two different records were prepared espe- cially for the exhibition, one with a background of falling rain, communi- cating the different phases of a rain- storm, the other a condensation of the sounds one would hear on a sunny day. They are played continuously from speakers located at various points in the hall. Under the general direction of Harry L. Shapiro, chairman of the museum's Department of Anthropology, the ex- hibition was designed by Katherine Beneker and documented under the supervision of Harry Tschopik, Jr. Aelurolaters The prehistoric inhabitants of Peru's northern coast, whose religion and art centered in the great cat god whom they worshiped, are described by Raphael Larco Hoyle, director of the Museum of Archaeology at Trujillo, Peru, in a handbook in the Smithsonian Institu- tion's series on South American Indians. Most advanced of these people, prob- ably vaguely related to the Indians who developed the Inca civilization in the Andes, were the Mochicas. Presumably this cat god started as a local deity, but among the Mochicas he was elevated into a supreme divinity. He is shown in Mochica art as a man with great fangs, a wrinkled face, and catlike whiskers spreading from the nose. This supreme god, Dr. Larco says, apparently was considered as ruling the destinies of the world, but he lived like people and could reveal himself both as a man and as a god. Numerous pottery vessels show him receiving sacrificed human beings who are being thrown from a high cliff. He sits at the foot of the cliff, receiving the blood of the vic- tim as a precious offering. He is shown in other pottery designs as a farmer shelling corn, as a fisherman in a small balsa boat, as a doctor, and as a musician and a hunter. He is pic- tured also holding up the rainbow in the form of a two-headed serpent, and as a god of war whose intervention is nec- essary for victory. An anthropomorphic lizard is his servant and a dog his faith- ful friend. A cormorant attends him while fishing, propelling the balsa boat. A sea eagle, appearing like a human figure, is the messenger who brings him the blood of the sacrificed. As a personi- fication of good, he fights demons, pic- tured as vampire bats in the form of men, sea demons, a two-headed dragon with one head set in his tail, and a serpent with ears. When he returns wounded from his contest with the de- mons, he is attended by buzzards and falcons. The great number of pottery vessels depicting religious scenes or beings, ac- cording to Dr. Larco, indicate that the life of the Mochica people was strongly interwoven with nature worship. Perhaps the most remarkable devel- opment of the Mochica culture, as de- picted in their pottery designs, was in surgery. They knew a good deal about amputation, and used circular knives for the removal of tumors. In ampu- tating arms and legs they used great care and precision, cutting the bone above the flesh incision in order to yield a healed stump. A femur and ulna have been found which show a perfectly healed fracture, indicating that these Indians knew how to set broken bones.

The Kensington Stone Runic inscriptions on the much-dis- cussed Kensington stone, supposedly left in central Minnesota near the mid- dle of the fourteenth century by a band of Norse adventurers, have been sub- jected to an intensive critical examina- tion by Dr. William Thalbitzer, Danish ethnologist and one of the fore- most living authorities on runes. (See Archaeology 1.116-117, 3.186.) The runes are clearly carved and easy to read - altogether too easy, it seemed to runic scholars at first. Even aside from the grammar, there were reasons to doubt its authenticity. It was known that there had been in the dis- trict about the time of the discovery a Swedish schoolteacher, an unfrocked clergyman, who had been a friend of Olof Ohman, who found the stone in 1898. He was said to have had a Swed- ish textbook in which a runic alphabet was printed. Since there are some words in the inscription surprisingly similar to English, it looked at the time as if it were the work of a clever but rather unscrupulous man with no ex- pert knowledge of runes or of the old Norse or Icelandic languages. Dr. Thalbitzer also reports on a runic stone of roughly the same pe- riod found on the small island of King- igJtorssuaq ten miles north of the present village of Upernavik in West Greenland - presumably left by an- other exploring expedition. No doubt ever has been raised as to the genuine- ness of that stone. Its language tends to support the authenticity of the Ken- sington stone. Hitherto Dr. Thalbitzer, together with most other Scandinavian runic experts, had considered the stone as fraudulent. But after the present study, and in the light of later discoveries, he reports: "I cannot but waver in my doubt. ... It seems to me that, after all, the inscription may be authentic." Dr. Thalbitzer's report on his more recent analysis of the runes which Elegy on a North African Roman Ruin The sun glides down the afrikanisch sky, The wheat tops shimmer in the breeze of eve, The quadratarius lays his mallet by, Les colons feed their patient cheptel vive. Der Töpfer stops the spinning of his wheel, Textrices still the clacking of their tela, The workmen seal the last few jars of huile And hang their smocks upon the senam's prela. The hungry fowls surround the vilica, The last late buyer haggles in the souk, The public slaves sweep the basilica, The camels wheeze and sneeze in the fondouk. At lengthy last the village Cicero ends, The curiales turn their footsteps home, Out past the pharos Caesar's legate sends Getreideschiffe on their way to Rome. O happy scene of plenty and of peace, Where land and man are partners nel lavoro! O that these quiet joys might never cease, Nor l'âge de fer succeed l'età dell' oro! Alas! the loom is still for evermore, The wild goats browse where once the wheat waved high, The sand creeps up upon the empty shore, The forum echoes to the hoot-owl's cry.

Ex-Editor The resignation of Jotham Johnson from the editorship of Archaeology takes effect with the publication of this issue. The present expectation is that the editorial work will be divided among three active editors, a sen- ior editor and two associates. Lo- cum tenentes for the as yet undes- ignated editor-in-chief, are Rob- ert L. Alexander and Marga- ret A. Alexander, of New York University's Institute of Fine Arts. Dr. Johnson, who has been editor of Archaeology since the publication of the first number, expects still to have his hands full as chairman of the department of classics at Washington Square College and classics adviser in the Graduate School of Arts and Science, New York University. He has also undertaken to con- tinue editing the Archaeological Newsletter through 1952. Winter 1951 249</page><page sequence="5">brought this change in his viewpoint has recently been published by the Smithsonian Institution. The original Kensiagton stone was on exhibition at the U. S. National Museum in Washington from February 17, 1948, to February 25, 1949, when it was returned to the Alexandria, Minnesota, Chamber of Commerce. The Smithsonian Institution has taken no position with regard to its authen- ticity, but felt that its presence in Washington would provide runic schol- ars a further opportunity to study it. A full-size replica is now on special exhibition in the National Museum. The Snows of Yesteryear On October 1st the Chicago Natural History Museum formally opened a new hall - named Frederick J. V. Skiff Hall in honor of the first director of the museum (1893-1921). It answers such questions as the famous one posed by François Villon, "Where are the snows of yesteryear?" - and such other questions as: "What part of the world was covered with ice a few thousand years ago?" "What living things ruled the world a few million years ago?" A long panorama of over a billion years of earth history is set forth in a series of entirely new exhibits, emphasizing the last 540 million years, the time dur- ing which the earth has been inhabited by living creatures. The snows that fell in Wisconsin a few hundred years ago are now being pumped from deep wells beneath Chi- cago, as water for industrial use. A diagram shows that the water has slowly worked its way through beds of underground porous rock. The area of the great ice sheet of about 25,000 years ago is shown as a cold icy-look- ing layer of plastic, covering part of a world map. Ancient animals and plants from the ages before history are there in abundance. Many are in the form of accurate life-sized models shown in natural surroundings, but more are shown as actual fossils, from Chicago's quarries, Illinois' coal fields, and hun- dreds of more distant places in the United States and elsewhere. An outstanding feature is a series of ten habitat groups restoring the weird creatures of eons ago. The res- torations show these animals as they appeared in life amid reproductions of their various natural environments. The natural groups of animals and plants are arranged in systematic se- quence beginning with the protozoans and sponges, and a case showing how foraminifera, tiny fossil protozoans, are important in oil-well drilling. In other cases are the groups of plants that have left a significant fossil record, begin- ning with a case showing the relation of fossil plants to coal, and ending with a "family tree" illustrating the relationship and classification of plants. Entering the hall from the east, the visitor sees first a group of introductory exhibits. People who collect their own fossils will find a map showing the dis- tribution of bedrock of various ages in the Chicago area, with examples of fossils found within 50 miles of the Loop. Another case shows what fossils are, and a collection of objects that look like fossils but are really some- thing else. Outstanding features of the new hall are spaciousness both in the arrange- ment of cases and of exhibits in them, tasteful use of color, and clarity in pres- entation of subject matter, with empha- sis on dioramas. •THE MEDIAEVAL ACADEMY OF AMERICA was founded in Boston in 1925 and incorporated under the laws of the Com- monwealth of Massachusetts "to conduct, encourage, promote and support re- search, publication, and instruction in mediaeval records, literature, languages, arts, archaeology, history, philosophy, science, life and all other aspects of mediae- val civilization by publications, by research, and by such other means as may be de- sirable, and to hold property for such purpose." Membership in the Academy is open to all persons interested in mediaeval studies. SPECULUM, published quarterly since 1926 by the Mediaeval Academy of America, presents articles and reviews concerned with mediaeval architecture, armor, fine arts, geography, heraldry, law, literature, music, numismatics, phi- losophy, science, and social and economic institutions of the Middle Ages.
