<plain_text><page sequence="1">"He do the Police in Different Voices99 By D. E. S. Maxwell Much of the response to The Waste Land, in 1922 was uncomprehending, hostile, or both. Nevertheless, the poem sold well and won Eliot the $2000 Dial award for the year. Its votaries read it as 'the voice of a generation,' a myth of contemporary apocalypse, a powerfully objective testament of desolation. Alert young men in university poetry anthologies were quick to line up the newly fashionable addresses: rat-infested alleys, tenantless houses, filthy river-banks. Rose Macaulay, however, remembering the poem's effects on her then, registers a somewhat different understanding of it. It spoke to her of an interior life and in a distinctively individual voice. "Here," she has said, were the ruins in the soul, the shadowy dreams that lurked tenebriously in the cellars of consciousness and arcades of dream, the wilderness that</page><page sequence="2">168 He Do the Police in Different Voices stretches not without but within... expressed in the authentic voice of one who ... with all his borrowings, remained himself.1 A statement by Eliot about The Waste Land insists more prosaically, de meaningly indeed, on its purpose as self-expression: Various critics have done me the honour to interpret the poem in terms of criticism of the contemporary world, have considered it, indeed, as an important bit of social criticism. To me it was only the relief of a per sonal and wholly insignificant grouse against life; it is just a piece of rhythmical grumbling.2 The statement has its truth. One knows more now of Eliot's sad, con suming first marriage, of his strain and overwork culminating in the early twenties and his own breakdown. The dialogue in 'A Game of Chess'—"My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me"—is, at a number of imagina tive removes, between Eliot and his wife, who secured the omission of the line, "The ivory men make company between us," and to the pub monologue contributed, "What you get married for if you don't want to have children."8 In the poem's accents one cannot mistake the conspicuously individual tone, "as recognizable," in Victoria Sackville-West's phrase, "as a well-known voice in the distance or a scrap of handwriting on a stray bit of paper."4 The Waste Land has certainly assimilated experience from Eliot's private life, assimilated and deeply submerged. About such experience Eliot maintained silence. It was only after the second world war that friends began to disclose personal glimpses of the poet. Some of their stories, it must be said, convey a strong sense of coming over a private line to an inner circle of the elect. They recall what passes for wit in the British House of Commons. One must take a great deal on trust. Others resemble James Thurber's story, 'My memories of D. H. Lawrence,' which turns upon two occasions when the narrator did not meet D. H. Lawrence. In Clive Bell's reminiscent essay, 'How Pleasant to Know Mr. Eliot,' the people of the group Eliot moves amongst—Virginia Woolf, Roger Fry, Aldous Huxley, Maynard Keynes—emerge at least as strongly as Eliot himself. Even Eliot's presence is unemphatic, withdrawn, observant rather than as sertive. Always, says Bell, "the poet made himself inconspicuous by the ap propriateness of his costume." And Wyndham Lewis concludes an account of his acquaintanceship with Eliot by saying, "... although I bring the scene to life in which Mr. Eliot at that stage of his career found himself, it is the scene, and not Mr. Eliot, I recreate."5 Amongst other arts of self-defence, Eliot cultivated the incongruous response.

Eliot A Symposium for His Sixtieth Birthday (London, 1948).</page><page sequence="3">He Do the Police in Different Voices 169 said that it was very interesting, Eliot replied, 'Yes, if one can see the full horror of it.'6 And to Lady Ottoline Morrell, who was rhapsodizing over Greek statues, he confided that they "gave him the creeps."7 Still, from these recollections, from diaries and letters now available, one can arrive at an impression of Eliot's manner and personality. It may seem an impertinent line of enquiry, especially with Eliot. He so often insisted that personality was a distraction to the reader, and to the poet an encum brance. However, I believe that thereby one may arrive, by indirections, at a central quality in his creative process, fully at work in The Waste Land. One of the earliest reports is in May 1914 from Bertrand Russell, recom mending Eliot, whom he had known at Harvard, to Lady Ottoline: ".. .ultra civilized, knows his classics very well, is familiar with all French literature from Villon to Vildrach, and is altogether impeccable in his taste but has no vigour or life—or enthusiasm. He is going to Oxford where I expect he will be very happy."8 As it happens, Russell was deceived. Eliot wrote to Conrad Aiken, "Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead."9 London, after some initial disappointment, proved more to his taste. But he does not appear to have radiated enthusiasm. Virginia Woolfs diaries refer constantly to an almost enervating effect produced by his com pany. In 1920, "Eliot coming on the heel of a long stretch of writing fiction ... made me listless"; in 1924, "... the telephone ringing with Tom's sepul chral voice." She recalls as a prodigy his response to the final chapter of Ulysses: "He was for the first time in my knowledge rapt, enthusiastic." More typical was Eliot as a dinner guest in 1921. Once again, Virginia Woolf insists on his inaccessibility and a certain self-defensiveness: ... pale, marmoreal Eliot was there last week, like a chapped office boy on a high stool, with a cold in his head, until he warms a little, which he did. We walked back along the Strand. "The critics say I am learned and cold," he said. "The truth is I am neither." As he said this, I think coldness at least must be a sore point with him. Finally, around the same time, she notes in his appearance a striking char acteristic reflecting some inner tension; ... his eyes are lively and youthful when the cast of his face and the shape of his sentences are formal and even heavy. Rather like a sculpted face—no upper lip; formidable, powerful; pale. Then those hazel eyes, seeming to escape from the rest of him. The lively eyes and the pale, passive features perhaps are emblematic. There was certainly in Eliot a spiritedness and an irreverence not apparent to Russell and Virginia Woolf—or not apparent then—as it was to Conrad Aiken. A continuing enterprise was the epic of King Bolo, whose Queen was "that airy fairy hairy 'un, who led the dance on Golder's Green with Car 9Herbert Howarth, Notes on Some Figures behind T. S. Eliot, (Boston, 1964). 'Stephen Spender, World Within World (London, 1951) pp. 162-3. "Quoted in Robert Gathorne-Hardy, Ottoline.

In the Faber office he indulged a liking for juvenile practical jokes, using coffee that foamed over and cigarettes that produced snowstorms. But over these years, 1916-25, he had little to stimulate him to gaiety. He taught in High Wycombe Grammar School, and Highgate Junior School, moving from there to Lloyds Bank and from £160 a year plus dinner and tea to £130 a year and no meals. For many of these years he worked fifteen hours a day. His wife's mental decline began and accelerated. Her bert Read describes her as pretty, vivacious; Stephen Spender, as gay, talk ative, a chatterbox. But the gaiety and candour degenerated into neurotic instability. At this period, too, Eliot had no great prestige as a literary arbiter. F. V. Morley, indeed, suggests that in 1925 the newly established Faber &amp; Gwyer offered him a job less for any opinion they had of his writings, than for his banking experience. When he did begin to establish some authority, when in the nineteen-thirties he became the Pope of Russell Square, he appears, in his encounters with others, to take on a weightier rôle. But it is a rôle conferred by them, not annexed by Eliot. II Eliot, then, in the early London years, is elusive, a presence that often disconcerted, discomposed, induced 'Portrait of a Lady's' "slight sensation of being ill at ease"; but ironic, discreet—"the silent master," William Empson recalls him.10 So far as we can apprehend him, he seems a figure, so to speak, while absorbed into a social landscape, also absorbing from it what he needs. 'Tradition and the Individual Talent,' Eliot's first major critical statement, comes from the meditations of those years. It is very closely in tune with the personality of the young man who wrote it. The celebrated—or notorious—argument of this essay is of course that the poet must divorce his work from his personality. If he does not, there will be pejoratively phrased consequences. Poetry will satisfy "those who demand of poetry a day-dream, or a metamorphosis of their own feeble desires and lusts, or what they believe to be 'intensity' of passion"; it will become "a collection of psychological data about the minds of poets"; and so on. Rather, Eliot says, "the more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates"; and so, "The progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality." In proposing this argument Eliot was quite consciously out to discredit the sub-Wordsworthian fashions of the period. Eliot wanted more rigorous approaches. He was asserting the autonomy of poetry, its right to be con sidered as a literary creation, not a substitute for gossip columns, or psy chiatric case studies, or anthropology, or religion. Eliot never, I think, formulated a systematic general theory of literature, with a logic that would reconcile his applications of doctrine to particular works, or writers, or, more broadly, the ways and means of the imagination. Nor do his many essays compose such a system. He had, rather, a number of attitudes to poetry. They are fairly consistent, but not entirely so. 10In March and Tambimuttu op. cit.</page><page sequence="5">He Do the Police in Different Voices 171 What unity there is lies in Eliot's persistent minimising of the importance to writing or appreciating literature of anything outside the work itself: re ligion, politics, its audience, even, in the most empirical sense, the 'experi ence' which supplies its matter. Hence, for example, his views on the relationship between poetry and philosophy, systems of ideas 'explaining' life. To what extent does our appreciation of a literary work depend on our attitude to the beliefs it embodies? Eliot's instinct was to segregate the two. Similarly, he dwells for the most part upon the distance between the 'real emotion,' the experience, and the poem to which, somehow, it leads, and in which, somehow, it is present. As he remarks in the Preface to The Sacred Wood, with his usual urbane equivocation, "poetry certainly has something to do with morals, and with religion, and even with politics perhaps, though we cannot say what." In any case, the quality or intensity of the original experience has no bearing on the quality of the poem. In the words of 'Tradition and the Individual Talent,' "the difference between art and the event is always absolute." How, then, is the individual talent to be put in its place? The answer, so far as 'Tradition and the Individual Talent' enunciates it, is in the first term of the essay's title. Though its propositions are well enough known, I should like to recall them at a little length. The tradition of which Eliot writes is European, the whole body of Europe's artistic achievement. His speculations on its nature, and its value to the practising writer, reflect his discontent with the fortuitousness and sparsity of its American counterpart. He regarded this as a kind of Black Hole in the literary universe, perpetually collapsing in on itself. He speaks of "the scattered fragments of American literature," and concludes that "Three or four great novelists do not make a tradition." Reviewing a book on the subject he says, "it is inevitable that any work on American literature should contain a great deal of stuffing," and that "the great figures of American literature are peculiarly isolated." He sought, and in the European tradition found, to his own satisfaction, a certain magnitude, complexity of parts, coherence, and organic growth. It is to this that the poet must assimilate himself. To do this, he must be closely and unremittingly aware of its constitution. Eliot puts it like this: He must be aware that the mind of Europe—a mind which he learns in time to be much more important than his own private mind—is a mind which changes, and that this change is a development which abandons nothing en route, which does not superannuate either Shake speare, or Homer, or the rock drawings of the Magdalenian draughts man. ... I am alive to a usual objection to ... my programme for the métier of poetry... that the doctrine requires a ridiculous degree of erudition (pedantry), a claim which can be rejected by appeal to the lives of the poets in any pantheon.... Some can absorb knowledge, the more tardy must sweat for it. Shakespeare acquired more essential history from Plutarch than most men could from the whole British Museum. What is to be insisted upon is that the poet must develop... the consciousness of the past and that he should continue to develop this consciousness throughout his career.</page><page sequence="6">172 He Do the Police in Different Voices The most interesting aspect of this, and the one perhaps least discussed, is its relativistic nature. Tradition itself changes: The existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new (the really new) work of art among them ... for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the whole existing order must be, if ever so slightly, altered ... the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past. The Shakespeare expounded by Dr. Leavis, or directed by Peter Hall, is not the Shakespeare of Dr. Johnson or A. C. Bradley, and none is more, or less, true than any other. Each is a response, which the great work of art can absorb, to this or that age's vision of itself, articulated by its artists. The process is a reciprocal one. The writer works in a universe of symbols, creating a structure of words and combinations of words. Tradition, the evolutionary record of such designs, is the testing ground of the artist's own devisings. And when his work takes possession of that ground, all the exist ing relationships enter into new perspectives. Partly, the benefit to the writer is technical. Tradition illuminates the problems of his craft, "the labour of sifting, combining, constructing, correct ing, testing." More important, it will open to him its capacious range of emotions which, in the process of artistic fusion, have taken on an identity entirely different from that of any possible original in real life. The poet will see that his own emotions may be insignificant, quite irrelevant to his pur poses, while, in Eliot's words, "emotions which he had never experienced will serve his turn as well as those familiar to him." In this way, tradition offers a liberation from, or extension of, the self. "Poetry," the argument ends, "is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it is to want to escape from these things." Eliot's early criticism abounds in obscurities and inconsistencies. What, for instance, is the exact distinction between the terms "feeling" and "emotion," so frequent in 'Tradition and the Individual Talent?' Even "tradition" Eliot uses here and there in a derogatory sense, and without any explicitly re strictive connotation. An early essay, 'Reflections on Contemporary Poetry,' severely belabours tradition, resorting for support, somewhat freakishly, to Pope Gregory XVI and the Vatican Council canon of 1870.11 Personality, too, is cast now as villain, now as hero. It's not my intention to pursue all these dilemmas, let alone resolve them. Generally, my view is that while contradictions emerge, there is a consistency of emphasis; and that often Eliot is assuming the existence of special definitions, precise distinctions, rather than stating them: halting, as he says, "at the frontier of metaphysics." "Personality," however, Eliot's concept of it, and its relationship to his poetry, is at the centre of all these concerns. But before advancing any conclusions, I should—at last—look at the poems themselves. nThe Egoist, November 1917.</page><page sequence="7">He Do the Police in Different Voices 173 III The poems act out the manner of Eliot's life. In his essay on Vergil, he remarked that a poet, in his poems, is talking about himself without giv ing himself away. The comment could well be applied to the young Eliot recorded by his London acquaintances. We are aware of a figure in a scene, a figure, so to speak, seeking camouflage in the scene—to recall Wyndham Lewis, .. it is the scene, and not Mr. Eliot, I recreate." The effort, in life as much as in the poems, is to present oneself without giving oneself away. Whether in the work or in the biography, we appear to be dealing with masks and masquerades. As in 'Prufrock,' "prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet"; in 'Portrait of a Lady,' "borrow every changing shape to find expression"; in 'The Hollow Men,' "Let me also wear/Such deliberate dis guises"; in 'Preludes,' "the other masquerades/That time resumes," where 'resumes' may mean both 'begins again' and 'summarises': the person is the total of the masquerades. In the poems the Eliot persona exists as an element in the landscape of the poem, often, indeed, defined by the landscape, from which it takes voice, tone, shape. Many of the early poems make the point fairly explicitly. The last word of the title, Prufrock and Other Observations is exactly pointed. In the justly praised opening passage of 'Prufrock' itself, it is the seemingly objective things, the evening, the streets, the restaurants, that impose their mood upon the speaker and his companion, and set up the nervous, jerky rhythms. There is a constant proposal of some intimate association between the setting and the person, who looks to the scene, present or recollected, to find a formula for his predicament. The scene is strongly present, sensuous ly, as an object; yet it is also given its character by the observer: I have measured out my life with coffee spoons Is it perfume from a dress That makes me so digress? Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl. Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully! Smoothed by long fingers, Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers, Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me. And again, there, the now quiescent evening sets up the languid pulse of the lines. In 'Portrait of a Lady,' Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon You have the scene arrange itself ...</page><page sequence="8">174 He Do the Police in Different Voices The street piano, "the smell of hyacinths across the garden," a glimpse of one's own expression in a glass, these, because of how they are seen, provoke the shifts of feeling of which they then become symbols. An am biguity of construction at the beginning of Part III is interesting: The October night comes down; returning as before Except for slight sensation of being ill at ease I mount the stairs. The ambiguity makes "returning as before/Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease" attach itself briefly to "The October night" as well as to the narrator. And at the end he sits, thinking of death, "pen in hand/With the smoke coming down above the housetops," returning the scene and the speaker to the smoke and fog of the opening lines, still, in a sense, standing in for, uttering, the speaker's private sensations. The 'Preludes' make even more overt statements of these concurrences: His soul stretched tight across the skies The conscience of a blackened street Impatient to assume the world ... the night revealing The thousand sordid images Of which your soul was constituted In general, the scenes are of the kind familiarly associated with Eliot's poetry: urban, squalid, faintly menacing. John Betjeman identifies London as one element in their constitution: the London of Bloomsbury, Pimlico, Highgate, Putney, the City; the nineteenth-century London of Sherlock Holmes, and a London older still. Here and there outside the poems Eliot has recorded his observations of it. In The Criterion for April 1929: Sherlock Holmes reminds us always of the pleasant externals of nineteenth-century London ... the han som cabs, the queer bowlers, Holmes's fore-and aft cap, Holmes in a frock-coat after breakfast ... in the Sherlock Holmes stories the late nine teenth century is always romantic, always nostalgic, and never merely silly. In The Dial for June 1921, on the proposed demolition of some London churches: To one who, like the present writer, passes his days in this City of London ... the loss of these towers, to meet the eye down a grimy lane, and of these empty naves, to receive the solitary visitor at noon from the dust and tumult of Lombard Street, will be irreparable.</page><page sequence="9">He Do the Police in Different Voices 175 The London, too, of his own day. In The Dial of October 1921, he wrote of Le Sacre du Printemps that its music metamorphosed ... the rhythm of the steppes [in] the scream of the motor horn, the rattle of machinery, the grind of wheels, the roar of the underground railway, and the other barbaric cries of modern life. In such observations are the origins of the recurring London sequences in The Waste Land. And the motor horns, the lanes, the towers, all assert their presence there, even, in the original version, "the closed carriage at four," until Pound objected to "carriage" as not contemporary. It was the London that Eliot came to know in the nineteen-twenties. Again it appears, "receiving the solitary visitor," as offering a protective coloration, objects and words for feelings, a vocabulary of the emotions. It is in The Waste Land, too, of all Eliot's poems, that tradition, by way of quotation and allusion, speaks most distinctly: "withered stumps of time," "These frag ments I have shored against my ruins," analogues of the "thousand sordid images," the "changing shapes," the sunsets, the dooryards, the streets. Poems like 'Prufrock,' 'Portrait of a Lady,' 'Rhapsody on a Windy Night' convey the sense of an individual identity, mood, moment of perception, whether one chooses to think of it in psychological or spiritual terms. Eliot's method, however, does not in any strict sense intend to imitate the inner workings of consciousness—in the manner, for example, of Joyce's 'interior monologue.' Despite his enthusiasm for Ulysses, Eliot did have reservations. "Bloom," he said to Virginia Woolf, "tells us nothing. Indeed this new method of giving the psychology proves to my mind that it doesn't work. It doesn't tell us as much as some casual glance from outside often tells." In Eliot's poems the persona is a confluence of images which, though toned by the observer, originate in the world outside him: "as if," Prufrock says, "a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen." The screen, the outer affiliate, is indispensable to Eliot's method. It is a method entirely in keeping with his manner, at this time, of enunciating his own personality. It seems also to find some warrant in the metaphysical theory that then attracted Eliot. Since the publication (1964) of Eliot's doctoral dissertation, Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F. H. Bradley,12 critics have sought to associate it with Eliot's critical ideas and poetic method. In his foreword to the essay, Eliot professed himself to be no longer able to understand it. Still, he was concerned with it over the years and the experiences that pro duced the early poems. It is reasonable to look to Eliot's exposition of Bradley for some accord between poetic statement and metaphysical theory. If not for light, perhaps for darkness visible. Bradley supplied Eliot with a comment on these lines from The Waste Land: 12A11 quotations from this work referred to KE and located in text. I am much indebted to Joseph Sanders, a graduate student at York, Toronto, for an illuminating essay on this work.</page><page sequence="10">176 He Do the Police in Different Voices I have heard the key Turn in the door once and turn once only We think of the key, each in his prison Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison The note on the lines, from Bradley's Appearance and Reality, reads as follows: My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my thoughts or my feelings. In either case my experience falls within my own circle, a circle closed on the outside; and, with all its elements alike, every sphere is opaque to the others which surround it... In brief, regarded as an existence which appears in a soul, the whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul. The poem in its own right is making, of course, among other things, some such statement, conclusive in its different idiom. The interest of the note is the relationship which it affirms between the personality and the world of objects and events. This particular quotation from Bradley appears to emphasise the insularity of individual perception of the outside world. Each individual's world is his own creation, inaccessible to others, literally a private universe. One must, however, set this in a more general context, for neither Bradley, nor Eliot's interpretation of him, in fact allows to the per sonality quite so despotic a rôle. Although Eliot's dissertation very seldom uses the term personality, the nature of personality is one of its enquiries. The terms Eliot does use, ap parently synonymous with each other, and at least roughly equivalent to "personality," are "the self," "the I," and "the soul." All these acquire some definition in the concept of "finite centres," which Eliot calls "the units of soul life." By this he means the shifting and fleeting points of view which make up the experience of an individual, so that, for any one person, in Eliot's words, "The real world... consists in the common meaning and 'identical reference' of various finite centres" (KE, p. 140). From this we may suppose that Eliot concurs in the proposition of The Waste Land quotation from Bradley: the world of each individual's aware ness is of his own making. There is, however, more to it than that. While each individual does in a sense construct his own world, the observing "I" is itself identified only by the objects and events which it perceives. It is not self-subsistent. The " 'identical reference' of the various finite centres" to which Eliot refers, he specifies as "one consistent world" (KE, p. 147). This world is outside the consciousness, and Eliot argues that only in it, "the world of objects," do we "have time and space and selves" (KE, p. 31). Consequently, he holds, "no finite centre can be self-sufficient" (KE, p. 147). The relationship he is examining is between the subjective and the ob jective, the inside and the outside. These are terms, as Eliot observed in another connection, "which provide unlimited opportunity for quibbling." But he went on to accept them as adequate counters. So shall I. Eliot's view of the relationship is perfectly explicit in allowing to the subjective—the self, the "I," the personality—a subordinate or dependent role. "We have no right," he maintains, "except in the most provisional way, to speak of my</page><page sequence="11">He Do the Police in Different Voices 177 experience, since the 'I' is a construction out of experience, an abstraction from it." And again, "there is certainly no such thing as consciousness, if consciousness is to be an object or something independent of the objects which it has" (KE,p. 83). These propositions lead Eliot to his central philosophical problem, which he formulates in this question: ... how do we yoke our divers worlds to draw together? how can we issue from the circle described about each point of view? and since I can know that there are other points of view, or admitting their existence, how can I take my account of them? (KE, p. 141) The two issues, then, are the relationship between each individual and the world around him; and, second, between the separate points of view which those relationships constitute. The first of these seems very like the relation ship endorsed by the various personae of the poems between them and their worlds. That is, the objects and events seen by an individual are peculiar to him, yet without those exterior references, he can have no being. Just so, in the poems, the scene, the setting is both an extension of the persona, and a means by which the persona defines itself. The second issue is that of discovering an area or level of being which will admit some mode of communion between the various independent souls. One cannot be sure that Eliot's metaphysic reaches an answer. His definition of the problem, though, as exemplified in some of the passages I have quoted, appears to have prompted Eliot to strikingly analogous literary surmises. One quotation, from 'The Function of Criticism,' may sufficiently indicate the analogy: ... I think ... of the literature of the world, of the literature of Europe, of the literature of a single country, not as a collection of the writings of individuals, but as "organic wholes," as systems in relation to which, and only in relation to which, individual works of literary art, and the works of individual artists, have their significance. There is accordingly something outside of the artist to which he owes allegience... in order to earn and to obtain his unique position. The writer's difficulties resemble those which Eliot ascribes to the "self." Again they turn upon subject/object relationships: between the poet and the poem, between the poem and the accumulated bodies of writing outside the poem, between the individual and his contemporaries. Here, plainly, whatever the metaphysical answer, it is to tradition that Eliot looks for a synthesis. Once more, the relationship which Eliot envisages—between the writer, or the poem, and tradition—is a reciprocal one. Only by reference to tradition can the writer locate himself and his work; and tradition adjusts its elements in response to that work. In the same way—to exemplify the analogy again— according to Eliot on Bradley: Facts are not merely found in the world and laid together like bricks, but every fact has in a sense its place prepared for it before it arrives, and without the implication of a system in which it belongs the fact is not a fact at all. (KE, pp. 60-61 )</page><page sequence="12">178 He Do the Police in Different Voices Or in Bradley's own words: Reality... is not the sum of all things. It is the unity in which all things come together, are transmuted, in which they are all changed alike, though not changed equally. And... in this unity relations of isola tion and hostility are absorbed.13 Between these concepts and Eliot's idea of tradition the harmonies are distinct. I do not want to press too far these analogies between the poetic persona, its imagined mise-en-scène, the self and its world, tradition and some meta physical Absolute. Nor do I suggest that the analogies confer any extra authority on Eliot's critical opinions? I do not, either, see Bradley as in any direct way a formative influence on Eliot. It is rather that Eliot found in Bradley a philosophy congenial to his own disposition; almost, indeed, an accounting of it; and that it is a disposition recognizable both in Eliot's literary theory, and in the method of the poems. As I have suggested, The Waste Land is its most capacious poetic demonstration, and I propose now fifty years after its first publication, to look at it briefly, from this viewpoint. IV The recent volume of The Waste Land drafts shows that the poem as we have had it is the poem as it should be. Hugh Kenner, writing before this publication, supposed that the cuts advised by Ezra Pound transformed the work from a loose sequence into a single long poem.14 As a long poem, with its disruptions, its multiple and dissolving fields of view, it must have been as bewildering to Eliot as to any of its first readers. So he fretted over its departure from the method of 'Prufrock,' a kind of monologue governed by a single consciousness. When he wrote the notes, he took the chance to advertise Tiresias in this rôle, an afterthought, says Kenner, which was not one of the assumptions on which he did the original writing. The manuscript does not appear to confirm this argument. Much of Pound's advice Eliot himself had in mind anyhow. And certainly by the time he had reached 'Death by Water,' he was thinking of it as Part IV, integral to a larger design. The poem's unity, or lack of it, is indeed the question, and Kenner, having depreciated Tiresias—I think rightly—does not much pursue it. The poem seems to me not to depart from but to amplify, or to disperse, the method of 'Prufrock.' Instead of a single grouping of "finite centres"—one consciousness—we have a mosaic. That Eliot was thinking of such a process is suggested by the title he gave the first two sections of the draft: 'He Do The Police in Different Voices.' The allusion is to Sloppy, in Our Mutual Friend, who with such vocal embellishments read out the newspaper police reports. Perhaps Ti resias, if we give some weight to Eliot's note on him, is the Sloppy of The Waste Land. But even if we cannot regard him as so fully the poetic "control" 13F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, introduction R. Wollheim (London, 1969), p. 432. ^*The Invisible Poet: T. S. Eliot (London, 1965).</page><page sequence="13">He Do the Police in Different Voices 179 that Prufrock is, his presence gives a broad hint about the poem's organiza tion. It is not Tiresias that is important. It is the speaking parts into which he fragments, or which through him briefly speak in chorus. The Waste Land is a composite of scenes and voices. The voices are disembodied. We do not see the personae whose voices we hear—Marie, the couple in 'A Game of Chess,' the Thames daughters: there is no physical description. Some whom we glimpse, like the house-agent's clerk, we do not hear. The voices are each distinguishable, though, if only because their speech is differently cadenced. But their separateness coalesces in a controlling mood, established by the landscapes and the other objects from which the voices build their worlds, and their consciousness of self. Though the land scapes shift and shimmer, they have features in common, most obviously their uncertain lighting: candle-flames, shadow, brown, violet, twilight, moon light, torchlight. More important is the relationship which the voices enter into with these surroundings. There is a curious argument in Eliot's dissertation whose point, so far as I follow it, is that feeling does not belong to or affect only the person who experiences it. It is also a property of the object which causes the feeling. Something of the sort is at work in The Waste Land, when the personae see their surroundings participate in what they feel and even what they do, rather as, in 'Rhapsody on a Windy Night,' the street lamp has a voice: in The Waste Land, "forgetful snow"; "sad light"; "agony in stony places"; "... the evening hour that strives/Homeward ... clears her break fast, lights/Her stove"; "staring forms/Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed"; "April... mixing/Memory and desire"; "fear in a handful of dust." This constant interaction between the voices and the settings creates the poem's unity, its ambience of co-existence, universal now in its compass, not drawing-room or brothel but Jerusalem Athens Alexandria Vienna London. One of the most extended sequences where the human sensations diffuse into the setting is the first one hundred or so lines of 'A Game of Chess.' The lady here is invisible. Her possessions, not any presence of her own, represent her, engross the scene: "doubled the flames," "reflecting light," "strange synthetic perfumes... troubled, confused/And drowned the sense in odours," "candle flames . . ./Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling": oppressive, phantasmal, vitiated. They leave the lady as, at most, merely an aspect of her bric-à-brac, inert and empty. The forms around her include paintings and statuary, which as well as being real and present objects are also remembrances of the past—"The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king/So rudely forced"—a tradition reduced to so many commodities. We have a perspective, that is, not only in the here and now, but also into the past and the relationships which that establishes. In this passage, the artwork takes the part which elsewhere in the poem goes to other poets and their works: Baudelaire, Shakespeare, Ferdinand Prince of Naples, Cornelia in The White Devil, Hieronymo, Philomel, and so on. Tradition, by way of quotation, allusion, myth recalled,</page><page sequence="14">180 He Do the Police in Different Voices supplies objects as real as the Thames, the London streets, the furnished rooms. The past, fitfully apprehended, joins the miscellany of objects which situate the personae. The Waste Land is not an exposition of Bradleyan philosophy. It transposes to poetic statement a world for which Bradley's definitions were appropriate. One may think of the transposition as satisfying Eliot's requirement of "felt thought," thought apprehended as immediately and sensuously as, in his words from 'The Metaphysical Poets,' "the sound of the typewriter or the smell of cooking." The Waste Land, in its peculiar—and marvellous—way, is a personal poem, made the property, over fifty years now, of so many people. Eliot is the clandestine inhabitant of all his work, evasive behind masks, personae, bodiless, oscillating voices, blending, in his work as in his days, into anthropomorphic landscapes. The work is personal in so closely imitating the strategies of temperament. The author of 'Practical Cats' named himself appositely. His rôle was to play possum. The man concocted from his milieu and coterie his "deliberate disguises," becoming almost a part of, indis tinguishable from, his surroundings. So the poet found his personal cadences outside himself, in the harmonies of tradition. So the personae and the topography of the poems are one. We are conscious of a remarkable integrity in Eliot's entire work, a com munity in his manner of thinking. The effort is to order a world of frag mentary and irregular experience, to cling to awareness of the dissolving shapes and voices of "this twittering world," and to stabilize them in a set of contexts. It is proper, at the end, to give the last word to the voice of an early spokesman, anatomizing the promptings of his stage, apprehensive, questioning: I keep my countenance, I remain self-possessed Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired Reiterates some worn-out common song With the smell of hyacinths across the garden Recalling things that other people have desired. Are these ideas right or wrong? York University Toronto</page></plain_text>
