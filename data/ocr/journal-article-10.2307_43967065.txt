<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Kindness Douglas Hyde Gallery 18 January - 24 February 90 John Kindness is not primarily a gallery artist: over the years he and his menagerie have cropped up in person or as images in airports, on buses, trains, on hoardings, and (if the project had been realised) as postage stamps. For that reason there was something both brave and at the same time incongruous about the large Kindness exhibition at the Douglas Hyde Gallery. Somehow I feel that the artist shared that sense of incongruity so that the souvenirs (I use the word advisedly) of the show not only included the mandatory up-market catalogue and colour postcard but also a button badge with a bright coloured false moustache stuck on. It was wholly appropriate that the catalogue essay was written by John Carson, another Ulster artist of the same generation as Kindness. John Carson's essay isn't an exercise in contemporary 'neo-post-ism' spotting and quotation. It is delightfully old fashion- ed description, and it exhudes the bonhomie of a fellow traveller who can savour the Ulster Fry in all its iconic glory. In fact, there is a serious logic to the form of Carson's introduction in that it recognises that the precise local environment which produced Kindness and, in consequence, Kindness's art needs to be spell- ed out in all its layers of kitsch, working class symbols and aspira- tions, double standards and gallows humour. Thus the key to the work and to the world view that informs it is that the artist of the City must seek to use the argot of the City that he knows best so as to offer an art that is one with the City rather than simply a tourist commentary upon it. The particular rhythms that coalesce into the urban identity of New York, or Glasgow or the Middle Eastern bidonvilles around Paris are not the same as those of Belfast even if there are parallels of industrial degeneration, majority/ minority conflict and poverty. Today there are assertive couture fashions, musical forms and visual shorthand which are proclaimed as street art. When it is taken up by the image makers it is called Street Art. But far from highlighting the phenomenon those capital letters serve to distance, to sever Street Art from its street art roots. I always get a feeling that Kindness is struggling with that dichotomy. He wants to point up, to give a shape to the multitude of signifiers of his Belfast experience but he doesn't want to isolate it from the en- vironment that creates the experience in the first place. That is where the sense of humour comes in. All cultures create an appropriate sense of the ridiculous, and this is generally vulgar ( vulgus , the common people) and embraces the corporal rather than the cerebral. Bodily functions, from eating through procrea- tion to dying (violently and messily) are the stuff of low humour throughout the ages. Kindness has the ear, the eye and the brain to catch the nuances of the self-mocking and sometimes grim and cruel humour of the Belfast street and to re-cast them in a form that is both familiar/specific and yet has a wider set of values. Because he sometimes sets up certain value systems in order to knock them down again we are rarely certain whether his final intention is affectionate or vitriolic. I find his work to be both full of contradicitons and to be about the nature of contradiction itself. So in order to try to make some sense of it for myself I have appropriated a working title - Kind- ness Week or The Seven Capital Elements - derived from the irrational novel and film respectively by Max Ernst, and created seven elements each with a cliched sub-title as a starting point. 1. Commerciai? Art? For a long while John Kindness did not figure in the conventional career development of the young local struggling art college graduate. He worked as a graphic designer. Re-enter the hoary old debate about art versus mere illustration. And despite Pop Art and even Surrealism as historical precedents some people find difficulty with Kindness's Art on the DART, a 1988 series of fake advertisements on the advertising panels of the Dublin Area Rapid Transport trains. There was, inter alia, CHUMROSE, a composite canned dog-food and baby-food for low income families, and DAIL EIREANN, a politically green sauce in a bottle whose lettering, 'DE', and shape echoed the HP brown sauce bottle which still features the British Houses of Parliament. For some, these and other ad-influenced works by Kindness do not so much challenge the conventions of advertis- ing as simply use them. 2. My Country Right Or Left. How political is John Kindness?</page><page sequence="2">40 John Kindness, Art on the DART , 1988. 5 panels, chalk on paper, 25 x 10ins. His critics would argue that he does not dig deeply enough into the real meaning of power and oppression and that he appor- tions blame equally. It is certainly true that on the large acrylic painting Night Canvas(s) the wallpaper of the terrace house is patterned with alternate faces of Gerry Adams and Ian Paisley. Nevertheless, in its very explicitness and lack of allusive sophistica- tion this work says much about the constant threat of doorstep assasination. The 20 foot long panel employs an almost mediaeval simultaneous narrative: approach, action, reaction all fused in a single instant. The victim is no tragic, beautiful inno- cent; he is as brutish looking as the killer and getaway driver, not far removed from the animals of Kindness's Monkey Town Besieged By Dogs, itself not a million miles away from Orwell's Animal Farm and the cruel caricatures of the 19th century which inverted recent Darwinian logic to reveal the Irishman as Ape. 3. Tom Wolf And Other Painted Dogs. Anthropomorphism needn't mean cuddly Beatrix Potter animals. Kindness shows monkeys and dogs behaving with all the bigotry and myopia of humans but you know that he doesn't actually mean it. Ugly and naturally vicious as his dogs on the side of buses were (the Skybreaker project) he had a soft spot for them and when they appear as sculptures he reduces them to only as many points of reference as will still allow them to function as four-legged creatures, although no longer necessarily definable breeds. 4. Has Fergie Got A Big Arse or What? If you recognise that phrase you've probably read VIZ comic, the acceptable and pro- fitable face of the British subversive comic. VIZ is unfocused crudeness, whereas Kindness has always managed in his work within the comic format (Belfast People's Comic) and work related to it ( his 'busy', linear style in all his work, monochromatic and colour) to offer a critique of the crass, the un-subtle and the ugly without simply replicating these traits. 5. The Raw And The Over-Cooked. The symbolic and paradox- ical role of the Ulster Fry exemplifies the affectionate and yet critical stance that Kindness adopts when trying to extend the animal/human relationship. Animals get slaughtered to provide the sausages and bacon for the Fry and unborn chicks adorn the plate sunnyside up. But they get their own back when combin- ed with fried bread, sodie farls and tatey bread in that they are not only the succour of the working class in Ulster but also a fat inducing killer. Kindness's heraldic Flag of food includes a Red Hand made of sausages and the ubiquitous tatey bread, which is also laconic rhyming slang for dead. Whether it's the coronary (Oh God! chalk drawing) or the bullet (Night Canvas(s)) or the natural animal cycle of hunter/hunted (Cat with Goldfish, Pike and Shellduck, Cat and Bird chalk drawings) someone ends as dead meat. 6. The Material World. Until this large representative exhibition I hadn't fully appreciated how sensuous is Kindness's two and three dimensional work. A graphic designer who creates camera ready images for reproduction cannot employ the full value of surfaces, so perhaps Kindness is compensating for his years as a designer by stressing the tactile quality of things. Chalk on sand- paper works well in a formal sense and has the added bonus of being a witty comment on the abrasive nature of the image. The dog sculptures take it a logical step further: Fierce Dog has a rough coat of gravel chips; Tame Dog is smooth and strokable; Big Shoe Dog is made of donated (i.e. recycled) shoe leather. 7. Archimboldo Meets Lop/op. Much of the work shown involves a simple substitution or transformation. Like the painters Archim- boldo or Joost de Momper, Kindness understands the potency of re-assembling disparate parts into a new whole. The broken fragments of cheap and kitschy ornaments of animals, birds and other once prized mantlepiece decorations can still be identified as such but together they create a Big Ornament, (a huge bird) whose scale, confidence and unashamed joy is very Un-Irish/Un- British. Kindness's use of the potentially cold technique of mosiac owes more to the exuberance of Gaudi or Rivera than to the sanitary tile stiffness of much public art and decoration executed in mosaic. Loplop is the " superior of the birds", the bird-headed man who appears in so many of Max Ernst's collages and is in fact Ernst's alter ego. Loplop is himself a transformed being, and as an anarchic figure he flits through The Seven Capital Elements altering things as he goes, substituting one form "for another, showing up hypocritical standards and mourning Life killed by familiarity, fear and lack of imagination. Loplop isn't afraid to harness all the elements of the animal, avian and vegetable kingdoms to create a new universe that is part black nightmare and part colourful joyous childlike dream. Kindness Week isn't Kindess Weak. Seen together in the respectable enclosure of the Douglas Hyde the frenetic energy of Kindness's bestiary seemed larger than the gallery. If some of the pieces were merely clever, as an ensem- ble they disturbed rather than reassured. I had once felt that his two large drawings showing a possible/impossible Stubbsian skeletal anatomy of a dissected Rubber Duck and a Rabbit Hot Water Bottle were slight visual jokes. Somehow, in the com- pany of the other broken down and reconstituted animal sym- bols which chased each other in an cycle of Life-Death-Life they seemed quite natural and wished ill to no one.
