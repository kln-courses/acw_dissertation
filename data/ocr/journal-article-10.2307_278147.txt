<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN UNUSUAL CACHE FROM THE WYOMING VALLEY, PENNSYLVANIA BARRY C. KENT ABSTRACT In 1964, topsoil removal operations in the Wyoming Valley, Pennsylvania, exposed a large cache of beads and shell objects. There is evidence that many of the beads and objects were originally strung as necklaces or belts, but these were destroyed when the discoverer washed the material. An attempt is made to reconstruct the con- tents of the cache and to determine its approximate age. A S THE Susquehanna River passes Lacka- wannock Gap, it flows into the Wyoming Valley of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The broad flood plains of the valley on either side of the river have produced abundant archaeo- logical remains. Many sites are covered by the city of Wilkes Barre and its numerous surround- ing communities. Untold sites also lie buried be- neath the ubiquitous culm piles from the valley's once active mining operations. Many of the plains which are no longer being farmed are rapidly being torn away, together with their sites, for saleabIe topsoil. In 1964 a topsoil removal operation in Plains Township exposed an unusual cache of beads and shell objects. The discovery was made by Mr. Peter Sarf of Avoca, Pennsylvania, who dur- ing the course of his bulldozing noticed the cache on top of one his dirt piles. The exact provenience of the find can no longer be recon- structed, as continued soil extraction has elimi- nated all points of reference. The approximate location of the find is at 6-7 in. from the east, and 2 3 in. from the south printed margin of the Pittston, U.S.G.S. map, 15 min. series, 1939 edition. Sarf indicated that he was excavating about 8 ft. below the original land surface at the time he created the pile on which the cache was found. It is unlikely, however, that the cache would have been interred that deeply. Some time after his discovery, Mr. Sarf showed the contents of the cache to several members of the Frances Dorrance Chapter of the Society for Pennsylvania Archaeology. They, in turn, reported the find to John Witthoft who was at that time State Anthropologist for the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commis- sion. When Witthoft first examined the collec- tion, he found that it consisted of several thou- sand shell and glass beads together with a num- ber of carved shell objects, all of which had been washed and strung on necklaces. According to Sarf's description of the cache in its original condition, the beads and various shell objects were in a grease-caked wad inside of a leather pouch. The pouch had been placed inside of two brass kettles which were jammed together mouth-to-mouth and then hammered to secure a tight fit. Sarf recalls that at least some of the beads may have been on single strands, but he was unable to verify whether or not the beads and shell objects were strung in any particular pattern before he washed them. In March of 1968, Mr. Sarf consented to loan the collection to the William Penn Memorial Museum for a period of three months in order that it could be studied and photographed. The two brass kettles in which the cache was contained were of medium size (Fig. 1). The overlapping kettle measured about 71/2 in. in diameter and approximately 33/4 in. in depth. The inner kettle was smaller in both dimensions by less than a half inch. Sarf removed the pouch through the missing bottom of one of the kettles. The bottom of the other kettle subsequently fell out, but it is still with the collection. Approximately one half of the tanned leather pouch, which is presumably buckskin, is extant. No sewn seams are present on this portion. A number of holes are visible (Fig. 2) around the crinkled mouth of the pouch, which suggests that it was originally closed with a drawstring. The pouch did have a greasy feel. Since it was becoming very brittle around its edges, it was treated with hot neatsfoot oil as a preservative measure before it was returned to Mr. Sarf. The inside of the pouch had retained the impressions of numerous beads, but no uniformity of arrange- ment which might suggest wampum belts was discernible. The contents of the pouch which were exam- ined at the William Penn Memorial Museum consisted of 16,967 shell and glass beads, 6 tubu- lar brass beads, and 24 carved and drilled shell objects. Originally the cache included a few dozen more shell beads and one large white columella shell bead, which were not with the materials examined at the Museum. 185</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY FIG. 1. Two brass kettles which contained the Sarf cache. The salient features of each of the several types of beads in the collection are presented in Table 1. All but 3 of 43 longitudinally split shell beads showed evidence of having been drilled from both ends. The few exceptions to this may have resulted from a nearly perfect meeting of the drill holes, and therefore they probably do not represent beads drilled in only one direction. The purple beads range in color from dark purple to grey; some of the white beads grade into a light green. For convenience, the basic dimensions and descriptive features of the various shell objects are given in Table 2. Two types of decorative elements are listed: holes made with one point of a pair of dividers or a drill tip, and small circles incised with a pair of dividers. Holes created by the point of a divider in describing large circles or arcs were not counted as decora- tive holes. Two of the objects (Fig. 3e, h) have gouge marks as part of their decoration; these were not included in Table 2. Six of the objects on Fig. 3 (e, g-k) are positioned so that their suspension holes are vertical. The exact loca- tions of the holes through the fish are indicated by lines on Fig. 3e. Suspension holes on all of the other objects pass through their necks. Five of the objects shown in Fig. 3 (g-k) are referred to in the literature as runtees (e.g., Holmes 1883: 229). Runtees commonly have two longitudinal drill holes, suggesting that they were suspended on paired strings. The runtees shown in Fig. 3 (h-k) each have two such holes, while Fig. 3g has three. The third hole may have served to suspend another object below it. All of the runtees are bifacially similar in design with the exceptions noted in Table 2. Each runtee has one face which is stained slightly yellow and is more highly polished, the staining being caused by contact with the skin. Two anthropomorphic birds are shown in Fig. 3 (a, b). The beaks and the folded wings are quite apparent. Each has a necklace and belt of shallow drill holes bordered by incised lines. The eyes are depicted by incised compass-work circles. The leg-like projections probably repre- sented the bifurcated tail of the swallow. The feet are stylistically portrayed by incised crosses on the bulbous protrusions below the belts. Heye and Pepper (1915: 38) illustrate a shell bird on which similar protrusions are much more obviously feet. The two turtles (Fig. 3d, f) are extremely similar in size and design and are the most obvi- ous pair of objects in the cache. Probably all of the large shell objects in the cache were cut from conch shells. In lateral view, the beaver shows the marked curvature of FIG. 2.

KENT ] CACHE 187</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY pieces of the sinew strands which once held them together were preserved. Wampum was commonly used in belts, but single strands of beads were often employed for many of the same functions. It must be noted, however, that wampum was also carried loose in pouches. John Hays' diary of 1760 (Hunter: 1954) mentions that the party occa- sionally passed the time by making strings and belts of wampum, obviously from the loose sup- ply carried by the expedition. Wampum was used parsimoniously by such travelers, and it was apparently strung as it was needed. There is one piece of evidence in the Sarf col- lection which suggests that at least a portion of this wampum may have been carried unstrung in the pouch. The cache includes one purple shell bead which was started at both ends but never completely drilled through. Had all the beads been strung in either belts or single strands, it is very likely that this one bead would have been lost. The presence of this undrilled bead very strongly suggests that a portion of the beads were unstrung, as they might have been secured from a bead factory or other place where they were made. This one bead could easily have been mixed in with finished beads where they were manufactured. When the rest of the beads were strung, it surely would have been drilled or discarded and not carried as one loose bead among a collection of belts and strings. Some of the beads were unquestionably strung as a few of them contained bits of sinew or other string material. It has already been noted that at least three of the tubular brass beads were originally strung in parallel rows. Shell wampum belts occasionally have other tubular beads woven into them, but rarely are glass seed beads so used. Such beads would more likely have been used in strings of wampum or in making up necklaces. Occasionally various objects were attached to wampum belts, but here again they were more common on single strands. It is possi- ble that the shell objects were suspended in this manner. The fact that many of them show bead wear at the mouths of their drill holes (Table 2) demonstrates that they were at one time sus- pended on strings of beads. All of the shell ob- jects, however, are drilled so that they would be suspended in a balanced position on a necklace but not if they were at the end of a single string of beads or wampum. The 4,782 black glass beads, together with the 43 miscellaneous beads, may have formed the basis for such necklaces. All totaled, the glass beads in the collection could have made as many as nine midchest- length necklaces (32 in. in length), which could well have accommodated the 25 single and/or paired shell objects. It might be concluded, therefore, that the cache probably contained a quantity of unstrung wampum, some strings of wampum, perhaps several belts, and very likely a number of neck- laces of glass beads on which the shell objects were suspended. The fact that the beads and objects were in a leather pouch is not in itself unusual; only the fact that it was preserved is out of the ordi- nary. Beauchamp (1901: 436) notes that wam- pum belts were carried in little sacks. Indians of the 18th century may have known that brass or copper would preserve various delicate and important items. Often, perishable grave offer- ings of 18th-century Indian cemeteries were in- tentionally placed inside of an overturned cop- per or brass kettle. This also raises the question as to whether or not the Sarf collection may have been a burial offering. The conditions under which the materials were found provide no answer. How- ever, the unusual amount of care used in pre- paring it for interment and the comparative value of the material would seem to imply that it was intended to be recovered. The first historical references to native popu- lations in the Wyoming Valley begin as early as 1701 when, according to Wallace (1961: 154), small bands of Shawnee settled there. All of the histories of the area pertaining to Indian settlements reflect a pattern of many short-lived occupations. Throughout most of the 18th cen- tury, the Iroquois encouraged Indians of other nations to settle in the Wyoming area. Although the Iroquois were unable to colonize the valley themselves, the presence of Shawnee, Delaware, Nanticoke, and Conoy there, under their in- vitation and protection, served to block white encroachment of the Iroquois country from Pennsylvania. As Wallace (1961: 153) has noted, the valley was a "nub of Iroquois geo- politics." This also meant that it was an area which was often contested and frequently trav- eled through. These conditions, together with widespread stress upon all Indians of the period, made the valley a politically difficult place in which to live. This pattern of temporary settlements in the valley may also characterize the century and a 188' [ VOL. 35, No. 2, 1970</page><page sequence="5">CACHE FIG. 3. Shell objects from the Sarf cache.

Archaeologically the valley ap- pears as nearly a complete void after about 1550 A.D. A number of stockaded villages existed here prior to this date. At about this time the Susque- hannocks, who formerly lived in Bradford County, were beginning to move southward. Their passage through the Wyoming Valley is marked by the presence of Schultz Incised sherds in at least two of the major stockaded villages of the indigenous peoples. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission has con- ducted excavations, which are as yet unpub- lished, at two such sites: Schacht (Lu. 1) and Parker (Lu. 14). No European trade materials have been found in association with any of these sites, indicating that they were not occupied long after 1550 A.D. Logically this would imply that the demise of these towns was associated with the migrations of the Susquehannocks through that area. No sites of the succeeding two centuries have been excavated in the Wyoming Valley. In fact, it is uncertain if any existed there between 1550 and 1675. By the latter date the Iroquois had defeated the Susquehannocks, thus making it possible for other Indians to move more freely throughout the Susquehanna Valley. The few scattered trade goods which have been found in the Wyoming Valley pertain to this post- Susquehannock period, but they are not associ- ated with sites of known dates or Indian nations. Charles Miner (1845: 26-7) notes the pres- ence of two cemeteries on the plain where the Sarf cache was found. One of these may be asso- ciated with the Parker site. The other, accord- ing to Miner's description, was a historic ceme- tery located on the riverbank, and it consisted of extended burials laid out in rows. The only documented finds from these latter burials include a number of blue beads and a vanity case (Miner 1845: 27). A King George I medal, also reported by Miner (1845: 27), was found on the surface in this general area. It is, of course, impossible to associate this medal, which may have been lost there during the reign of King George I (1716 to 1727) or anytime thereafter, with the historic cemetery. Unfor- tunately it is also equally impossible to demon- strate any relationship with either the medal, the cemetery, or any attending historic village, and the Sarf find. Members of the Frances Dorrance Chapter of the Society for Pennsylvania Archaeology report that several burials and refuse pits were exposed in the general vicinity of the cache. The few identifiable artifacts recovered from these fea- tures during the course of the bulldozing indi- 190 [ VOL. 35, No. 2, 1970</page><page sequence="7">CACHE cate that they were pre-contact in origin and therefore not temporally related to the cache. With this as a starting point, it was obvious that any attempt to assign a more specific date to the cache would depend upon comparisons with similar objects from dated sites in other areas. It was also apparent that the cache could not clearly be attributed to any one particular Indian tribe of the seven or more that are known to have settled in or passed through this valley during the post-contact times. The shell wampum is of little help in attempt- ing to date the cache. Tubular wampum has its beginning some time prior to 1600 A.D. in the Seneca sequence (Wray and Schoff 1953: 56). It is also known from the pre-1600 Susquehannock cemetery at the Blue Rock site in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania (Heisey and Witmer 1962: 115). The Sarf wampum is technologi- cally later than these, but it is of a general type which was made until at least the end of the 18th century. Woodward (1934: 20) notes that wampum was still being supplied to the Indians, primarily those just west of the Mississippi and in the Great Lakes region, until the 1840's. Many of the wampum beads during this last stage of their use were almost twice as long as those of the 17th and 18th centuries (see, for example, Orchard 1929, P1. X). Runtees or drilled shell disks may have con- siderable antiquity in North America. It is possi- ble that the crosses and, particularly, the floral designs which frequently appear on conventional runtees may reflect a European influence. How- ever, crosses are also known from Mississippian engraved shell objects. Both Indians and whites are known to have made and used shell wam- pum, and perhaps this is true for some shell objects. Runtees may be an example of this, whereas the animal and bird figures display an artistic style which is more purely Indian. The types of runtees found by Sarf are certainly post- contact in date, if for no reason other than the fact that their suspension holes had to be made with fine steel drills. Extremely similar runtees are reported by Heye and Pepper (1915: 30-5) from the late 17th-century cemetery at the Bell-Philhower site in Sussex County, New Jersey. Wray and Schoff (1953: 58) note that runtees of this type are just beginning to appear in the Seneca sequence dur- ing the 1650-1675 period at the Dann and Marsh sites. Heye and Pepper (1915: 37-43) also describe shell figures from the cemetery at the Bell-Phil- hower site which are basically similar to the fish, beaver, and birds of the Sarf cache. Another very similar fish was recovered by an amateur archaeologist from a grave at the Conestoga site in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, which dates from about 1695 to 1763. Less ornate shell tur- tles and geese have been found at the Susque- hannock town of 1635 to 1675 known as the Strickler site in Lancaster County. None of the forms depicted by the shell figures in the Sarf cache is unique. Each has been pre- viously described in the literature (see, for ex- ample, Beauchamp 1901), but in few cases are the comparative forms as ornate or as finely made. Trade beads have in recent years become important in dating post-contact sites. In com- paring the glass beads of the Sarf cache with dated samples, it soon became apparent that they included a number of types representing a long timespan. The spherical blue and the subspherical black beads (Table 1) are identical to types found on Susquehannock sites of the period from 1575 to 1675. Heisey and Witmer (1962: 117) have shown that these types have their greatest occur- rence in graves associated with the Washington Boro Susquehannock village, which is dated be- tween 1600 and 1625 (Witthoft and Kinsey 1959: 95). The blue and white subspherical beads described in Table 1 are also like types which enjoy their greatest popularity at the same time in the Susquehannock sequence. However, somewhat similar seed beads again become popu- lar during the 18th century, e.g., at the Cham- bers site in western Pennsylvania, where they are by far the most common beads. This site has been assigned dates of 1750 to 1775 upon the basis of historical records (Zakucia 1960: 12). Tubular or cylindrical glass beads like those in the Sarf cache (Table 1) have their earliest oc- currence in both the Seneca and Susquehannock sequences at about 1635. Brass tubular beads are rather timeless, appearing in all sites of the Susquehannock sequence. The latest beads in the cache, and therefore the most important in terms of dating the find, are the 20 clear glass, wire-wound, faceted beads (Table 1 and Fig. 4). Identical beads have been found at the Conestoga and Conoy sites in Lan- caster County. The beginning date for Conestoga is uncertain, but it was probably just prior to KENT ] 191</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 1700. The last occupants of this town were killed during the infamous Conestoga Massacre of 1763. According to Wallace (1961: 108), Conoy Town was occupied from about 1718 to 1743. Small quantities of similar faceted beads have been found in grave lots from two separate sites represented in the Deisher collection at the William Penn Memorial Museum. Both sites produced total bead inventories very much like those from Conoy and Conestoga. One of Deisher's sites, located about 1/2 mi. northeast of Kutztown in Berks County, Pennsylvania, in- cluded a number of other trade materials. Among these were two kaolin pipes with the letters "ER" stamped on the proximal side of their bowls. H. Geiger Omwake, who examined these two pipes (personal communication to John Witthoft, August 18, 1953), suggested that they might have been made between 1720 and 1740; thus, possible dates are provided for the site. No wire-wound beads of any type are reported for 17th-century sites in this region. Only a few wire-wound faceted beads, and none like those in the cache, were present in the Chambers site (1750-75) collection in the William Penn Me- morial Museum, which includes more than 4,000 beads from 70 graves. Witthoft (1967) notes that a number of the wire-wound types of the Conoy site (but few of the faceted type under discussion) are present at the Wyandotte site (1748-51) of Old Kuskuskies at West Pitts- burgh, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania. He also suggests that by 1760 these wire-wound types were no longer in use. The paucity of these beads at the Chambers site would seem to con- firm this statement. On the basis of the evidence presented here, 1700 to 1760 would appear to cover the approxi- mate time range for these faceted beads and, therefore, represents the earliest period during which the cache could have been buried. All of the other beads in the cache are known to occur on earlier sites, some perhaps as early as 1600. Their inclusion with beads known only from 18th-century sites is, however, not unusual. Wray and Schoff (1953: 60) have noted the use of grave-looted beads by later Indians, and cer- tainly there must have been a few heirloom pieces. If the William Penn Memorial Museum's sample from the Conoy Town in particular is any indication, the practice of securing beads from 17th-century sites must have been rather prevalent. All of the 18th-century sites men- tioned here have some 17th-century beads in them. It is quite evident, however, that those sites which date after 1750 have far less of these early beads than those which come before this date. If this is indeed a valid criterion, then the high percentage of 17th-century beads in the cache might place its dating before 1750. The precise date for the introduction of wire- wound beads is uncertain, however, as Witthoft (1966) has suggested they probably began some- time after 1700. All varieties of wire-wound beads appear to have reached their peak of popu- larity at the Conoy Town (1718-43) and at other sites of this same period. This might imply, then, a narrower time range for these beads- perhaps 1720 to 1750. Such dates would not necessarily bracket the period of complete manu- facture of the belts and necklaces and their subsequent interment as a cache. The contents of the pouch, which may have been acquired over a period of time, undoubtedly had some sort of ceremonial or political significance to its owners, who would therefore have used them and who obviously intended to preserve them as long as possible. From 1700 to 1768, when in accordance with the Fort Stanwix Treaty the Iroquois ceded lands (including the Wyoming Valley), the Shawnee, Delaware, Nanticoke, Conoy, and occasional Iroquois are all known to have settled in the valley for different lengths of time. Many groups traveled through the valley during this period, and the histories mention various Indians there until at least the time of the American Revolu- tion. Any further guesses at this point as to when or which Indians deposited the cache would cer- tainly tax the reader with far too much specu- lation. Unfortunately it seems that the truth will never be known. The site is gone, the origi- nal condition of the contents of the cache is destroyed, and there is every promise that other sites which could provide answers will be found only as a result of man's fatal need to strip, spoil, and scar.
