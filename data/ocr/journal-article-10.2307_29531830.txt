<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW-ESSAY EIGHT WAYS OF LOOKING AT JAMES1 ADELINE R. TINTNER Of these eight authors at least five seem to have read Barthes, who wrote, "One can say that the critical task is purely formal, not to 'discover' in the work or the author something 'hidden,' 'profound,' 'secret' which hitherto passed unnoticed (by what miracle? Are we more perspicacious than our predecessors?), but only to adjust the language his period affords him (existentialism, Marxism, psychoanalysis) to the language, i.e., the formal system of logical constraints elaborated by the author according to his own period." If this is what the critical task should be a number of these authors have fulfilled it. Forms from struc? turalism, phenomenology, or semiotics are funnels through which they pour us old wine that to this reader has already turned a bit sour. But to the reader who does not accept Barthes's definition of what a critic should do with the authors' works under enquiry these books leave a lot to be desired. In the case of James we can say we are "more per? spicacious than our predecessors." The letters of James are being published; a fine bibliography is available, a five-volume life that docu? ments the many relationships James had with his family, friends, and fel? low writers, a name, title and place index to the critical writings?these are available for scholarly perusal. One now has tools to investigate the text of James's oeuvre and to relate that work to the world it was part of. Concordances of Shakespeare, Tennyson, and Milton are there to be checked in relation to James's incorporation of their work into his. His interest in the inclusion of art in his work can be interpreted by a grow? ing scholarship of art which makes many of the pictures he saw available to the student. With so much material at hand, what do we get? [73]</page><page sequence="2">74 / REVIEW-ESSAY Rereadings, a study of Adams and James which does not tell us very much although elegantly written, a book about "rhythms in James" with random sensitivity to random icons and a concentration on the language in at least four. The personal reaction of one writer to the language of The Golden Bowl, uneasiness, attempts to break down James's language into the components of uneasiness itself. At least two writers think that James stirs up anxiety and then assuages that anxiety in the same sentence, showing that focus on language is surely a fashion of the times. Three old-fashioned studies seem to come up with facts that are useful. These books for the most part do not reflect the results of new in? vestigations in James's work but base their critical attitudes on personal interpretations which have been given piquancy by the inclusion of cur? rent critical fashions. Phenomenology and semiotics are the points d'ap pui from which Veeder and Yeazell conduct their studies, and Graham's "drama of fulfillment" makes its argument from the currently "in" emphasis on "inter-disciplinary" impressions. Comparative analysis produced two of these books, one on the two Henrys, Adams and James, and one on the two Jameses, Henry and William. There are only two studies which one can say have investigated relatively untrodden areas, one on the material circulating in James's world, at the time he wrote "The Turn of the Screw," and the other a study in depth of the Turgeniev-James interaction, this time by a student familiar with Rus? sian language and literature. The icing on this composite pudding is the little smooth book by one writer about another in whose tradition he was nurtured, Auchincloss's Reading Henry James, although the icing is a lit? tle stale. This well-written trip through the oeuvre of James is not a wasted experience, although some of the critical attitudes are old fashioned. These eight volumes do not overlap much. Two concentrate on single works of fiction; one, Sheppard's on "The Screw" and one by Yeazell on The Bowl with attention to its language as an epistemological tool. Hocks handles James in relation to his brother's pragmatism in an exhaustive fashion and Rowe wraps up James in relation to Henry Adams in a competent historical and literary study. Veeder sees James's work as it frees itself from the linguistic cliches of popular nineteenth century fiction. Peterson's study of Turgeniev's influence on James is a superior comparative analysis, since specific stories are treated. There are in all two overviews of James's work stemming from different temperaments and background. The first shows Graham's British feel for the texture of the fiction; the other reveals Auchincloss's American view of James's achievement. One tendency manifested is concentration on fewer novels and stories and even where a number of books are considered only one or</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW-ESSAY / 75 two seem to surface as the touchstone. The Wings of the Dove is impor? tant for at least two authors. The Golden Bowl is the chief consideration of YeazelPs book and Roderick Hudson, now coming to the fore, is the focus of Graham, Peterson, and Veeder, although the latter concentrates mostly on The Portrait of a Lady. For Hocks, concerned with the Henry William philosophic interrelation, the late works, especially the late short stories, are important. There is an entire book on "The Turn of the Screw." The two 'overview' books by Graham and Auchincloss pay a lot of attention to The Tragic Muse, now rising in the critical canon chiefly because it lies there begging to be noticed, not because anything new is added. In his study of Turgeniev's influence on James, Peterson looks into all aspects of the literary and personal relationship between the two, coming up with interesting connections between specific stories. He shows how the young James was educated through the Rev?e des Deux Mondes, in which he devoured Taine's essays on Balzac and the stories of Merimee. The reconstruction of the early years at Newport under the French bias of LaFarge, although not new, is very well done and ex? plains James's susceptibility to the sympathetic pessimism of Turgeniev. Peterson's main point is essentially derived from James's first essay of 1874 on the Russian master. The American writer was well aware that Turgeniev "gives us a peculiar sense of being out of harmony with a native land"; "he has a poet's quarrel with it." James compares the situa? tion with his own, for "Russian society, like our own, is in process of for? mation." He sees the Turgeniev heroines as having "to our sense a touch of the faintly acrid perfume of the New England temperament?a hint of Puritan angularity." Peterson's thesis is based on an insight of James that the two men have temperamental affinities stemming from their similar cultural locations on "the provincial periphery" of Europe. Turgeniev, Peterson tells us, "opened up to Americans the prototype of a provincial bildungsroman" discussable "in cosmopolitan circles." This also seems to be what James said very succinctly in his second essay on Turgeniev in 1884 after the Russian's death: "Cosmopolite that he had become by the force of circumstances, his roots had-never been loosened in his native soil." The fact of Turgeniev's cosmopolitanism, an "ism" which itself appears in so many of his stories, should have led Peterson in his study of comparative plots and situations in Turgeniev and James, to the one and only place where James mentions "le roman russe." It oc? curs in the story "Collaboration," 1892, and illustrates the virtue of cosmopolitanism when applied to artistic collaboration. It contains</page><page sequence="4">76 / REVIEW-ESSAY another piece of evidence of the Turgeniev connection ignored by Peterson, the incorporated literary parallel of Faust. It is highly probable that this allusion is to remind the reader that the young French poet and the German composer in the story are, in their collaboration, similar to the famous collaboration (out of time) between the French composer, Gounod, and the German poet, Goethe. It also reminds the ideally cosmopolitan reader that Turgeniev in his story, "Faust," also uses Goethe's poem as the disturber of a young woman's peace of mind. The "cosmopolitanism" of "Collaboration" invokes not only Turgeniev but also Bourget, whose "Cosmopolis" was being written while James stayed with the author in Italy. The Turgeniev influence seems to spill over in another story written just at the same time, "The Visits," in which the sense of shame felt by both James's heroine and the Turgeniev heroine in "Faust," leads to their deaths. But Peterson does not see this connection which to this reader seems so striking. He does, however, see other evidence of Turgeniev's fiction in other manifestations. I find most il? luminating his notion that the title of James's early story "My Friend Bingham" imitates Turgeniev's, "My Neighbor Radilove," which makes good sense. The tie with Turgeniev once established, one then sees for oneself that the hunting theme in James's story was probably suggested by Memoirs of a Sportsman. Peterson sees James's "Three Meetings" modeled in both title and substance on Turgeniev's "Four Meetings." He has also found a model for "Daisy Miller" in the story, "Asya," although the Russian heroine seems to have a much more servile relationship to the men around her than Daisy had. For James the basic idea of a young girl flaunting society would be enough to get him started on his own material in his own way. Peterson interprets the difference between Turgeniev and James as simply the differences of their specific nationalities. Both writers "ex? pressed the plight of provincial consciousness" which "struggled to ac? commodate its thirst for experience with indigenous moral sensibilities." James's middle course helped Americans "to define realism as a function of a given culture's point of view." James put their differences so neatly and so succinctly that I feel I must quote it here in relation to the above more complicated passage. He writes in 1884 of Turgeniev, who did not seem to be interested in some of the stories James sent him. "He cared, more than anything else, for the air of reality, and my reality was not to the purpose. I do not think my stories struck him as quite meat for men. The manner was more apparent than the matter." Peterson sees "Madame de Mauves," a story just now being courted by critics, and "Eugene Pickering" as "tales of disenchantment," typically Turgeniev in place and mood. James called Turgeniev above all "an observer and a poet," two functions he himself would try all his life to exercise. The</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW-ESSAY / 77 "richness and sadness" of the Russian's prose were the two other ele? ments James admired in the same essay. Peterson again phrases these in? sights in a more complicated, but less original form. He says that James got from the Russian a "visionary poetry of reconciliation to life's gross vitality." He ends his book by saying that James learned how to impose an "aesthetic shaping of experience" which would become "a redemptive exercise of the free spirit's sovereign imagination." Perhaps, but from James's own comments other factors were probably involved in the evolution of his esthetique, especially his training in the plastic arts and his admiration of Merimee. However, "the richness and the sadness" of the Russian may be what Peterson is thinking of when he concludes that both men attained "victories of perception over predicament." Louis Auchincloss in Reading Henry James, illustrated with Max Beerbohm cartoons, begins with Henry James the man and the artist, goes through the stories and novels, and ends up with James as a critic. He sees James's celibacy as a result of his failure to play his part in the Civil War. His interpretation of the "evil" in the later novels is defined by negatives. Good is what is not "in Kate's and Charlotte's natures" and what is in Millie's and Maggie's (he does not accept the newer at? titude to Maggie as a kind of villainess). "James was intentionally fitting the richest kind of integument around his prime intelligences." He also, wrongly, I think, says that James came to be "himself the master impres? sionist of the novel, for in his last works he abandoned . .. exact descrip? tion and substituted a long series of dazzling metaphors." What do "daz? zling metaphors" have to do with impressionism? He explains the pur? pose of the notebook entries and apologizes for their lack of political comment. He has a theory about how to distinguish minor from major stories. Where "the imagined . . . situation does not of necessity imply the existence of at least one strongly individual character ... the resulting story is minor James. If... a vivid . .. character seems to spring inevitably from the donnee, a major James work is in the making." Among the stories which he thinks are decidedly minor, I will agree on "The Path of Duty" but not on "The Marriages" (and R. L. S. agreed with me), and I think he misses the whole point of "Lord Beaupre." It becomes the tussle between a cagy mother who tries to get her daughter wed to the most eligible bachelor in England by devious tactics and her daughter whose pride prevents her from taking advantage of the situa? tion. Auchincloss, seeing in "Glasses" merely the story of a beautiful woman who must wear glasses or else go blind, shows a certain blindness on his part to a story which penetrates the very heart of human vanity.</page><page sequence="6">78 / REVIEW-ESSAY He recognizes that Balzac's Eugenie Grandel is an important source in Washington Square along with a Trollope story, but he is wrong, when he writes, "In Balzac . . . the lover alone is the villain," not the father, as in Washington Square. The whole point of the Balzac tale is Eugenie's stub? born resistance to her father, exactly the issue in the James story. Both heroines, French and American, carry their resistance on after their fathers' deaths. They resist their lovers on their return and continue their battle with their fathers. Auchincloss pooh-poohs the International theme and he deplores the mechanical way in which James kills off Daisy by snubs. He thinks that the redeeming thing about James's overconcern with the International theme was that it produced The Portrait of a Lady. That "so deep a work of fiction should spring from so shallow a subject" is because it is only its starting point. He adds that "Isabel Archer's tragedy might almost have been acted out in New York" (hardly, since the New York at that time could not have tempted her). Yet Daisy, he says, "shows the opposition of Americans to Americans, not Americans to Europeans." For me the point is that Daisy was a Byron in petticoats for James. If we Americans were ever to have a Byron it would be a girl, who would go to Europe as Byron went to Greece. In her own analogous way she dies like Byron, of the fever, not at Missolonghi fighting for Greek independence but in Rome, fighting for the independence of the young American girl abroad. The story abounds in Byronic allusions: Chillon, the Colosseum at midnight, etc. "The Siege of London" 's Mrs. Headway is a crude character and the family of aristocrats is also broad? ly sketched with a hint of caricature. But Auchincloss overlooks the main point: the issue between the two young men who have just seen two plays by Dumas fils and by Augier, distressing to one of them because the "intruder" woman is lied to in order to be gotten rid of. The plot demonstrates how an American sympathetic to the "intruder" woman as a human being still manages to tell the truth about her origins. The ten? sion between his conscience and his sympathies is resolved when Mrs. Headway's beau marries her anyway. He thinks The Reverberator is great since he admits "the crunch of the situation is* a class crunch" (p. 70) "rather than an international one," and he considers Dr. Lemon in "Lady Barberina" a nincompoop for having married the Greek goddess type of Englishwoman, the kind of model Lawrence and Romney painted that entranced the New Yorker bred on English art. "Lady Barberina" as a story has more strength than Auchincloss gives it credit for and it may have instigated Oscar Wilde to write his "Canterville Ghost." Wilde has Americans come to England to live on Lord Canterville's estate, and pays back the Cantervilles for their shabby treatment of Lemon. Since Lord Canterville was the name of Lady Barberina's father, the situation has been farcically reversed by</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW-ESSAY / 79 Wilde. Auchincloss's summaries of the plots of such works of com? plicated art as The Princess Casamassima sound like Walt Disney ver? sions of The Idylls of the King. He also takes it for granted that Rosa Muniment "the crippled sister . . . came out of Dickens," following Tril? ling, forgetting that James said he could not stand that particular Dick? ens character. It seems more likely that the literary model, if there is one, is Vanda de Bourlac Mergi, the crippled daughter of the Baron de Bour lac in Balzac's Envers de THistoire Contemporaine, who confined to her bed conducts a lively life in a room lavishly decorated by her family. Auchincloss refers to the Balzac period of James's work, placed early in James's career, yet recent studies have pointed to a dependence on Balzac throughout his career. There is no such thing, it must be realized, as the one Balzac period in James. The Tragic Muse with its dilemma of the artist's role in society is discussed at some length. Auchincloss believes that James's asceticism in regard to his calling as an artist was an image he created because of his "failure of manhood," and I think he is wrong in saying that James agreed with Peter Sherringham that the stage was horrible. Auchincloss summaries sound like fairy tales for children. He is too much taken with plots. Miriam as an actress is as much a heroine as Nick is a hero and James does not share Peter's point of view. Auchincloss does not seem to penetrate the most superficial layers of James's story in The Tragic Muse. "James never convinces me that Nick is a great painter in the way he convinces me that Miriam is a great actress." Nick is not supposed to be a great artist (he may or may not end up as one) but the important thing is that he does what he wants and is not manipulated. Unlike Nick, Miriam never has any doubts about what her career will be once she is launched; she knows that only hard work will get her there. For it is not for nothing that James has invoked Reynolds and his "Tragic Muse," Mrs. Siddons. He knew about Sarah Siddons from Fanny Kemble, her niece, who told James in his twenties all about her aunt and had written about her in a book James owned. Anyone acquainted with the legend and facts about Mrs. Siddons's life will see how he drew on it for Miriam, down to the parts she played, even to the actor-manager hus? band she marries. Even though Auchincloss is a writer, he does not seem sensitive to the formal aspects of James's work. Auchincloss's judgment about whether the ghosts are real or part of the psychotic governess's love frustration in The Turn of the Screw seem well taken, for he thinks "James was conscious of both interpretations and that he used the ambiguity so created as a means of avoiding the an? cient dilemma of ghost-story writers." I quite agree that the so-called ambiguity of Henry James is nothing more than the ambiguity set up by the ghost story itself. We must remember, and the Beerbohm cartoon re</page><page sequence="8">80 / REVIEW-ESSAY minds us, that it was an archbishop who told the tale. A ghost story can? not be written if there is no ambiguity operating during the reading of the story. Auchincloss points out dramatically through quotation how James's stage notes show that he was really writing a novel while pretending to write a play, which accounts for its failure. However, if one looks also at Shaw's stage notes, one knows that, although they too do something for the armchair viewer of the drama, they do not interfere with the play's success on the stage. So the argument does not hold. Auchincloss sees The Awkward Age and What Maisie Knew as "Revul? sion from Sex" (different from Peterson who thinks they share fascina? tion with sex). Auchincloss admits James is exposing Laura Wing in "A London Life" as a hysterical girl but he insists that "identification [of James] with Laura and her dismay was growing," for he finds in The Sacred Fount sexual cannibalism expressive of James's extreme antipathy to sex. On the contrary, I find that the novel is saturated with sex, even the narrator falls in love with one of the characters and engages in the love tension of them all without cannibalizing. Mrs. Wix and Maisie he sees as clinging "to each other in the chilly hall of the vast bordello that is their universe." It also can be seen, this looser sexuality, as allowable in Edwardian England where James was now publishing many of his stories. Auchincloss thinks the antisex period beginning with "A London Life" and lasting ten years is a neuroticism that disappears with old age (p. 117) and that with The Ambassadors he not only tolerates adultery but becomes the champion of Chad and Madame de Vionnet. Auchincloss notices that in James's fiction the people with schemes are poor. He might have noticed that in addition to Balzac James was reading Gissing's New Grub Street, one of the greatest modern novels dedicated to the bitch-goddess poverty; as poverty had been the demon of Gissing's novel, it is also the demon of those characters who are caught in the world of the rich in James. The scheme in the last novels is not as Auchincloss puts it. The Assinghams are not rich and are good. Densher is poor and not evil. Mrs. Lowder is rich and not good. In The Golden Bowl Prince and Charlotte are paupers in the world of the rich. This relative condition of the poor to the rich James may have seen in New Grub Street since he read it with admiration. Auchincloss finds the three short stories written after the impact of the new American exhibit "rather crude satire." He misses the point of "The Jolly Corner" as I read it, for he thinks "the story has a nasty implication . . . that Spencer Brydon is a bigger man for having spent his life in Europe ... America is to be avoided at any price." The careful reader sees that Spencer stays and becomes a real estate promoter, realizing his potential as his alter ego and still having had the benefit of European values. He becomes his alter ego, pressed by his energetic friend Alice Staverton, who plays upon</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW-ESSAY / 81 the imagination he has cultivated in a European education of sensibility in order to prepare him for an American career. In The Ivory Tower Auchincloss misses the fact that even being cheated is something Fielder enjoys. Oddly, Auchincloss seems to be careless in his reading of the American stories, which should be his forte. However, he does notice that "The American Scene" is a new kind of writing. He also notices, with Pound, that for James European culture started in the eighteenth century. ("Put down in the seventeenth century James would be stripped of 90 percent of his culture.") Auchincloss's overview is important mostly because he has not ex? posed himself to scholarship other than that of Edel in the past twenty years, for those who have been so exposed tend to get caught in the ver? biage. Of the six books that remain to be discussed only two have submit? ted parts of their studies to the judgment of their peers and it is not sur? prising that these two are probably the best of the lot, even though their focus is restricted. In his Henry Adams and Henry James John Carlos Rowe finds the two men taken in relation to each other tend to shed light reciprocally, for they both reflect a fundamental shift in American literature, "from an earlier transcendental and logocentric vision to an increasingly speculative and experimental emphasis on methodology" (p. 9). And they both "deal . . . with a phenomenology of knowing that characterizes much turn of the century thought and literature." As to Henry and William, Rowe says, "What Henry James called 'the spreading human scene,' his brother termed 'the field of con? sciousness.' " Both Henrys "recognized the need for new methods to deal with an increasingly pluralistic world" (p. 37). They both experi? ment with different literary forms in an attempt to give symbolic shape and meaning to reality and a self. Henry James does it aesthetically and Henry Adams historically. Both their studies of consciousness are characterized by process and relation. By his viewing of James's prose through relations to Adams and, behind that, to William, Rowe sees the symbols of the late novels, par? ticularly The Golden Bowl, as "the successive interrelation and in terpenetration of consciousness" (p. 45). It "achieves its meaning as a reflection of the process of symbolization itself (p. 45). The Golden Bowl therefore is a prime example of this pluralistic symbolic activity. In con? nection with James's interest in symbols, Rowe remarks on the impor? tance of the vitrines containing precious objects that line the walls of the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre, a feature of James's famous dream, a</page><page sequence="10">82 / REVIEW-ESSAY recall of a boyhood experience. It seems to me that it is high time someone noticed that the great presence in that room is the ceiling by Delacroix which had been unveiled just a year or two before the young James saw it for the first time. It created a great sensation and still dominates the room as one enters it. Indeed, it has been overlooked that the theme and the atmosphere correspond absolutely to the theme of the James dream. Apollo, the god of art and the symbol of the creative spirit, is overcoming the serpent, the destructive element, the nonartist, while the lightning and thunder seen in the background brought in by the ser? pent give way to the radiance of the victorious god. The "awful agent, creature or presence" which James routs in his dream (in which lightning and thunder too are repeated) is the equivalent of the writhing serpent conquered by Apollo. James's sensitivity to painting and his reticence to face his real problems might have concealed from him the source of his figure but there it is high above him. I notice again that the material critics focus on in the late novels is always the same. The Bronzino and the Veronese are pressed into carry? ing the entire symbolic structure that underlies The Dove. But since Rowe does admit to "pluralistic interpretations" one wonders why he misses emphasizing that part of that symbolic apparatus of the book which would link Henry James to Henry Adams, namely, the Gibbon element with the Ravenna mosaics, the identification of Milly with Theodosia and the imperium of the Byzantine empire which also goes hand in hand with the revival of such historical images as were part of Symbolism, the art movement then sweeping over Europe. As it is he pushes the Bronzino identification too far, and adduces a corollary to it that seems totally irrelevant, for whether or not he thinks James either consciously or unconsciously put the spirit of the Bronzino Panciatichi Madonna which sits near the portrait of Lucrezia Panciatichi into Mil ly's character, the connection is gratuitous and confusing. "The relation of the two paintings, whether or not James himself made the com? parison, illustrates the problem of Milly's life and death." Although the attribution of the Bronzino portrait by Miriam Allott has been more or less accepted by all, it still is speculative. To build another speculation on that speculation is hardly good thinking. There are many symbols in The Wings of the Dove "which point to James's focusing rather on the portrait through-history than on Bronzino's many works, secular or religious. Rowe says, "The reader's voyage is a quest... a creative transposition of the language into the forms for his own understanding." James's iden? tification of Milly with a portrait is "a determining system imposed on the ambiguity of experience." This is another example of the current at? titude to James as a writer tyrannizing the reader, doing violence to the freedom of the reader (see a recent review in the TLS by Poulet).</page><page sequence="11">REVIEW-ESSAY / 83 Rowe is best on The American Scene, for it fits into the theme of his book. By "investigating aesthetic forms in terms of historical analogy, James clarifies the process of consciousness coming to be." He might have made more of the comparison between the travel books of both writers, since one traveled to the past and the other to the future, for James saw rather in the country America had become the future being made. Rowe's attitudes to Maggie in The Bowl also reflect the current tendency to see her as a manipulator who has broken with "her father's idealism" and who "uses her knowledge to preserve the illusion of order. In her misuse of creative power, she demonstrates how the symmetry of art can do violence to the real." At this point I usually think, what else could the poor girl do, given the situation the four find themselves in? Does the reader want Maggie to donate Charlotte to the Prince? Does not James make both Maggie and Adam atone for their placing Char? lotte, the "intruder," outside the area of danger to them by their pity and compassion for her? There is no hatred or cruelty to Charlotte but Mag? gie must manage her own life. There is nothing in the book to show that Charlotte's experience is anywhere as radically emotionally disturbing as Maggie's. Charlotte, too, does what she can in a very touchy situation which she herself has brought on, as the reader must be reminded, and she receives the plaudits of everyone but the Prince. Maggie finally is the one character who finally "does" in life what James "does" in art, and we all know "it all takes doing." I also dislike the careless use of the word ambiguity, which now is as? sumed by many critics to be a proven demonstrated aspect of James's work. Actually the ambiguity in James when it exists, in spite of Wilson's essay, is to be found only in his ghost stories. Ghosts for the modern man have to be "ambiguous" in order to exist in a story and one suspends dis? belief for the reading. Failing to reach a definitive conclusion about the meaning of the novel, many critics fall back on the old concept of am? biguity that is now updated. They try to show that even the syntax of the prose reflects James's ambiguity to a virtue. Oh, Edmund Wilson, what hath your essay wrought? Rowe invokes Geoffrey Hartman's description of James's attitude to knowledge: "James obstacles himself; he simply refuses simply to know. Every mind tends to be viewed through another, and the desire to know positively ... is always presented as a vampirish act." This seems a complete falsification of the pluralistic philosophy of William and Henry behind Henry's late fiction. If the world is a constel? lation of pluralistic aspects it does not mean that the mind must forego knowledge. In fact, the more minds the better and that is one reason that we have in The Golden Bowl the case presented by Fanny, by Maggie, by the Prince. The aim is not to establish ambiguity but to dissolve it.</page><page sequence="12">84 / REVIEW-ESSAY Strategically the points of view help and the metaphoric language further implements clarification, not obfuscation. The Drama of Fulfilment by Graham is a personal interpretation which tries to present James's rhythms mainly in Roderick Hudson, The Tragic Muse, and The Wings of the Dove, with a glance at "Madame de Mauves" and "Daisy Miller." We have not read sixteen pages when our confidence in the author is shaken because he tells us that "Daisy Mil? ler" was "subtitled 'A Sketch.' " Actually, of course James wrote "A Study" but Graham's inaccuracy involves him in an embarrassing es thetique based on the sketch, for he continues, "and it seems to work as fine sketches do, and with the advantages a sketch has over a finished picture, that the tentativeness and quickness of its lines can best convey the living mystery of a personality like Daisy's!" Nor does he stop there but concludes that "James ... is always something of a sketcher." He believes "in the fleeting impression," etc. If he had only substituted the word "Study" for "Sketch," one can imagine the very different nature of the flight of ideas stemming from that word. It would undoubtedly have been a flight nearer to the truth. Graham finds the terraces and parapets in both "Madame de Mauves" and "Daisy" very significant, and throughout the book one gets the idea that the art and architectural icons of which Graham is pleasantly aware seem, however, not to il? luminate the text the way they might. However, the author's sensitivity to their effect makes him turn up at least one happy find. In The Spoils when Fleda approaches Poynton at the end James makes her aware that "off in that corner was an air of wild rain, but there shimmered across it a brightness that was the color of the great interior she had been haunt? ing." Graham interprets this sentence as indicating that The Spoils are a "mirage" in Fleda's mind "with an excess of opulence in them, like a glimpse into one of Turner's paintings of the rooms at Petworth" (p. 158). The happy few who are familiar with the blazing Interior and Music Party at Petworth in the T?te can see that Turner's fiery vision of an ex? quisite drawing room fits Fleda's premonitory vision of the "things" go? ing up in flames. "The Aspern Papers" tends to distract him again with its doors, its garden, its walls, and its masks dislocated from the central meaning of the story. He shows evidence of sloppy homework when he mentions James's comparison of Juliana to "Mrs. Siddons, Queen Caroline and Lady Hamilton" as "historical demi-mondaines." Of the three only Lady Hamilton could be called a demimondaine, since at no point in Mrs. Siddons's career had there been scandal attached to her and since</page><page sequence="13">REVIEW-ESSAY / 85 Queen Caroline, in spite of her life, was nevertheless a queen. In my opin? ion James invokes the trio more as colorful women of a past era, for he follows with, "it seems to me that she belonged to a generation as ex? tinct." Graham pays a lot of attention to The Tragic Muse. He likes it "especially for its air of assurance . . . that security of tone, almost clas? sical in effect, that is the criterion of James's best writing." Graham has good instincts, and in his feelings about the classical quality of the novel, he is groping to understand its basic form but never gets around to it. He hits another bull's eye when he sees that "Nick is the hidden artist in us all" which answers the readers disturbed by the fact that we are not told whether or not Nick ever becomes a great painter. But again Graham's seduction by artifacts in James's novels blinds him to the author's great control and formal use of these plastic cores of creative energy. His sen? sitive awareness of the similar metaphors given to Notre Dame and the abbey of Beauclere screens from his view the basic formalizing, fusing element in this book that joins two fables, the one of the artist and the other of the actress. The clue is in the title, as James himself tells us in the Preface to the novel. It is the analogue of Sir Joshua and his great portrait of Mrs. Siddons that, together with the analogue of Romney and his portraits of Emma Hamilton, dramatize and concretize in the painter-and-sitter structures the two choices that are before Miriam: either the serious actress and artist, like Sarah Siddons, or the fille de joie who becomes the wife of an ambassador like Lady Hamilton. This dou? ble analogue is adumbrated at first in the portrait of Rachel by Gerome, which is the first of the portraits on which the book is strung (this is a figure by which Nick sees the great portraits that hang in the National Gallery). As for The Tragic Muse we must not forget that James thought highly of it even after he had written his late novels, for it figures in the five novels of the advanced list he prepared for Stark Young late in life. He respected that book and he went on record as saying there was much more in it than people would ever notice. In his section on The Wings of the Dove he contributes nothing new, paying attention, as everyone does, to the Bronzino and the Veronese, plus some heed to the architectural images in the metaphors which again are not focal, although for him they "take on the quality of touchstones," since they are dramatic as well as visual. He concludes his book with a plea for the strength of these images, for they "implicate us with a new definiteness, through the power of dramatic illusion." Through that drama we are able to grasp "a sense of life that will define us to ourselves, and fulfill us" (p. 232). Hence the "Drama of fulfilment."</page><page sequence="14">86 / REVIEW-ESSAY The limitation of E. A. Sheppard's book, Henry James and "The Turn of the Screw" is that the connection between the fascinating material he has dug up which was accessible to James at the time of the writing of The Screw and the use to which James puts it, is unclear. Shep pard ignores certain literary influences such as that of Wilkie Collins (mentioned en passant only twice) which influenced James artistry more than the random journalistic stuff Sheppard has dug up, interesting as it is. Some of it is simply absurd because James's mind rejected certain kinds of material. James's mind is not Shakespearian, not a kind of celestial flypaper. James rejects what does not fit into a system that is selective and closely welded. There is no reason to think that James thought of "Miles," meaning "a young soldier," when naming his boy Miles in The Screw. If we recognize Miles as another name (a minor one) from Jane Eyre at least we see it as part of a pattern which in James more often than not is his way of suggesting to the reader that he should keep in mind a story parallel to the one James is telling, in this case Jane Eyre. Sheppard tends to treat his conjectures in the next chapters as if they have already been accepted as fact. As for the recurring problem of am? biguity, James uses it in his famous letter to Meyers in a special way. In talking of his "small inventions" (his stories) he says that they are "the fruit ... of a very imperfect ingenuity. . . . The one thing and another that are questionable and ambiguous in them I mostly take to be condi? tions of their having got themselves pushed through at all. The Turn of the Screw is a very mechanical matter, I honestly think." Sheppard writes as if "ambiguity" refers to the ambiguity of meaning in the story. It is clear James is referring in his letter to the ambiguity of his getting the story written. "I somehow can't pretend to give any coherent account of my small inventions 'after the act.' " Sheppard builds up a case for James's making George Bernard Shaw the model for Peter Quint, as "a covert attack on Shaw" but in? cludes a meaningless comparison of the antithetical characteristics of each. It seems rather silly to prove that Quint is Shaw because the "things" Quint taught Miles would be Shavian, "mockery and denials of authority, of social obligations, of moral and religious sanctions" . . . "Miles as a boy atheist and an anarchist and Flora as an infantile 'new woman' would be phenomena shocking to Victorian teachers and guard? ians. . . ." This kind of reasoning seems all too tangential to say the least. These are gratuitous suppositions one could easily challenge. Sheppard unconvincingly says that "no one to this day would quarrel with James's summary damnation of the latter [Lord Leighton]." I would do so, for James's overall view of the painter, Leighton, was admiring and the year after Leighton died James missed "the note of style, the note in par? ticular of knowledge," and in the case of Millais as well as of Leighton</page><page sequence="15">REVIEW-ESSAY / 87 there "were things that?on occasion we missed in them; but evidently after all, they could ill be spared" (p. 255, The Partner's Eye). Sheppard ignores James's earlier very enthusiastic criticisms of Leighton's work. We are glad to be reminded of James's visits to Ford Castle, Lady Waterford's home, because we see Fordham Castle of 1904 coming out of it (p. 90). Although Martha Banta did the spade work in bringing in the Psychical Research Society and its connection with the ghost stories, Sheppard has done a great service in quoting whole sections from the case books. The reader can see how James, who must have looked at these books, would be fascinated by the reports and even if he did not believe them he might be sensitive to their style. The reports of Miss X who installed herself in a country house, Ballechin House, do suggest the prose and the point of view of the James governess. They are the most convincing pieces of evidence for new data connected with The Turn of the Screw (the Shaw points seem absurd, the Jane Eyre ones by this time acknowledged). Instead of muttering about how many different kinds of things John Marcher's beast can be, what about paying attention in "The Beast in the Jungle" to the riddle of the sphinx, the realization, from the story of Oedipus, of the immutability of law? There is another story about knowledge which James wrote in his twenties, "A Day of Days," probably inspired by Moreau's Salon picture in 1865, Oedipus and the Sphinx, showing a new kind of relation between Oedipus and the Sphinx. Would it not be more instructive to investigate the sources for James's stories of "knowledge" and find out what materials went into the imaginative projection of the riddle of the universe, by what it is guarded and how man can penetrate it? The critics up to now have been engaged in circular arguments and never go out of the story for their interpreta? tions. Sheppard, however, does happily emerge from the orbit of the story of The Screw to investigate those currents of thought circulating around James which might have contributed to his fantasy. Hocks's thesis is that what William names, Henry dramatizes, notably in his later fiction. He makes a slogan, "Jourdanism" from James's statement that all his life like M. Jourdain he had "unconscious? ly pragmatised," even though, as Hocks points out, the irony was that William disliked the late books of his brother. The author defines Wil? liam's view of cognition as essentially "ambulatory" or "made out of in? tervening parts of experience through which we ambulate in succession." In this way he claims that William dramatizes "knowing," as Henry, in</page><page sequence="16">88 / REVIEW-ESSAY his late style, dramatizes "action and character." Does the invention of "Jourdanism" help in any way to illuminate James's work? When Hocks gets down to the specific analyses of the late works, he goes in for what the rest of us do, close reading, instead of using a theoretical umbrella. However, one of Hocks's contributions to an explication of "The Jolly Corner" comes from William's idea of the "subliminal self which "may make at any time interruption into our ordinary selves." Hocks believes this is the basic presupposition underlying Henry's "ghost/y" reality. He strains a bit when he finds William's metaphor of "the white radiance" coming "through the dome, with all sorts of straining and situations imprinted on it by the glass" reflected in the metaphor in "The Jolly Corner" where the hall in the house is compared to "some great glass bowl." Hocks thinks that this metaphor in conjunction with the notion of "the subliminal self is evidence of identical thinking on the part of both brothers. However this may be, they converge, as Mattheissen earlier observed, upon the question of immortality. "Is There a Life after Death?", James's fascinating essay of 1910, is invoked and we can read that James saw "the medium and the trance" interesting for themselves as such, not because they might "savor of another state of being." James makes it clear that the notion of immortality comes from being a living human being and having a consciousness that must believe in the pos? sibility of an extension of itself. Hocks claims that this interesting document resembles "the relationship of Spencer Brydon to his alter ego." In his attempt to justify the idea Hocks reviews the details of the 1906 story to support the notion expressed in the 1910 essay where James says he finds himself "in com? munication with sources" from which he learns "far more and far other combinations than observation and experience have given me the pattern of (p. 223). It is "a question," he says, "of desire," not belief. From these words Hocks sees the foundation for James's late interest in the supernatural and in the extension of "the boundaries of human con? sciousness." Hocks sums up his argument that the "Jourdain" relationship as Henry's embodiment of William's doctrine of pragmatism shows "the fusion of energy and activity with thought and reflection" (p. 227). Hocks finds "Polarity embedded with the unity between them," "Polarity which consists of the energy of its own opposite concentrated at its opposite." This entire elaborate structure has been erected to ex? plain only one piece of Henry's fiction, "The Jolly Corner" specifically and one novel The Wings of the Dove rather vaguely. Like one of Rube Goldberg's machines, the apparatus does not seem to have enough work to do.</page><page sequence="17">REVIEW-ESSAY / 89 In Language and Knowledge in the Late Novels of Henry James Ruth Ye,azell writes that every reader, especially those who know a lot about James, are disquieted when they read the late novels. The more they have read earlier works the more "epistemologically unsettled the actual ex? perience of reading James's late fiction can be." She notices this through a discrepancy between the facts of the novel and the language used in them. She stresses the element of "delay" in James's later novels, and she implies almost in psychoanalytical terms that this shows a reluctance to face "the central mystery, sexual passion"; "the hidden knowledge which the Jamesian innocent must at last confront" (p. 20). The language of the book in its "pauses and timidities is the very mirror of the movements and the reluctance to move to discover knowledge of all the characters." The reader experiences the characters' "shocks and fears with a peculiarly disturbing immediacy: the narrative style of the late novels acts as a powerful metaphor for the movement of the characters' troubled and painfully divided minds" (p. 28). To prove this the author cites two long quotations, the first, Strether's reaction to the discovery of Chad and Mme de Vionnet's adultery and the second where "Maggie suddenly finds herself paralyzed by the strength of desire?" and at the same time holds off the Prince by using the word "wait." In the moment of discovery they are finding out what they really knew before. When Ms. Yeazell writes about "The Imagination of Metaphor" she tells us that some of our unease . . . stems from the fact that James's metaphors "seem almost invariably responses of the brain, not of the senses. The Jamesian universe is not one of material resemblances" (p. 41). I find this observation is belied by the remarkable resemblance of many objects contained in The Bowl metaphors with ob? jects d'art, sculpture, faience, furniture, and painting, found at Wad desdon Manor, Ferdinand de Rothschild's house, which James knew well and described as that "gorgeous palace" whose effect on him would last a long time. James had very acute senses, as his autobiography at? tests to and his impressions depended largely on touch, on smell, and above all, on sight, very much as did Proust's in Swanns Way. Ms. Yeazell agrees with the pace and rhythm of "ambulation" as Hocks defines it in the Will-Henry James order of perception and imaginative creation. Her important arguments occur in the chapter, "The Imagination of Metaphor." Ms. Yeazell says that metaphor distances one from the truth and shows indecision. Her definition runs counter to the definition of most rhetoricians of contemporary standing or of any time, for metaphors were thought up to create a set of similarities proposed to elucidate, not to obfuscate. Its clarifying function is admirablv</page><page sequence="18">90 / REVIEW-ESSAY demonstrated in a recent book called, in its explanatory subtitle, "Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth Century Developmental Biology" by D. J. Haraway. It assumes that a scientist's choice of metaphors helps to show how he solves his problems. James also uses metaphors to help his characters solve their problems and in The Bowl, the book most laden with metaphors, where the level in which the metaphors operate seems a metaworld, the main character does solve her problems through their aid, for they help situate her in a world in which these dilemmas can be solved. Whether Maggie is considered a villain or heroine, evil or good, castrating or liberating, any reader must agree that she solves her problem (and she does it in the face of great difficulties) by constructing models through metaphoric equivalents of paradigmatic situations comparable to her own, and she hits the jackpot. She gets her prince and establishes order out of anarchy. Good or bad she gets positive results. James's metaphors for this reader are not indirect nor meant to be. They meet the demands of specification; like metaphors in poetry or anywhere else they are a teaching and telling device to make the abstract realizable, touchable, seeable, pinchable, and smellable. Ms. Yeazell cites the metaphor that Strether and Miss Barrace build up (the burial of a character up to the chin), as evidence that "speaking in metaphors, like thinking in metaphors is a way of confronting and of avoiding unpleasant facts." Strether and Miss Barrace "assert a kind of witty control over the entire uneasy situation." In her beautiful prose Ms. Yeazell, a kind of Virginia Woolf of Jamesian criticism, sees the world of The Bowl as follows: it is a place where "clear-cut terms of good and evil no longer apply,?a world of ambiguities and fearful mysteries, one in which knowledge itself must re? main finally tentative and uncertain. And only through metaphoric in? direction can such knowledge even be approached" (p. 49). "The strain which the reader senses in a Jamesian metaphor has as its deepest source this intense struggle between the pressure of feeling and the need to con? tain that pressure." The melodrama of the early novels has moved in? ward, in the late novels, and has "become the stuff of metaphor . . . James's characters dramatize the human need to make such fictions?to channel intense feeling by giving it narrative form ... in the imagination of metaphor the desire for escape and the impulse toward uncomfortable discovery are strangely entwined. What excites us most deeply in the end is less the thought of beasts and burning ships than of just such strange entanglements." It is curious how Ms. Yeazell reminds the reader of Simone Weil's essay on the Iliad written over thirty years ago, but no one would quarrel with the violence of the Iliad exhibited there even though it took a religious mind to uncover that aspect of the epic. But</page><page sequence="19">REVIEW-ESSAY / 91 unlike Mile Weil's Iliad, The Bowl does not affect most people as it does Ms. Yeazell. For this reader the book is a triumph over uneasiness and anxiety by Maggie's strategies. It seems that Ms. Yeazell has got the meaning of a metaphor all backwards, for it is an attempt at clarifica? tion, at getting to what may be a pluralistic truth. James has set up a series of metaphors which, if they do not take care of the entire explana? tion, at least cover many aspects of the truth which now is multifold. The analogues which metaphors construct are seen by Ms. Yeazell in Freu? dian terms, but this reviewer, who tends to see James's analogues in Aristotelian forms, is in the position of having to deny Aristotle, who defined man as a thinking animal (perceiving would be a better Jamesian word) and having to redefine man as an anxiety ridden animal. Ms. Yeazell would have James's highly intellectual exercise, the analogue, converted to a defense against anxiety. Therefore, one has to conclude that Ms. YeazelPs interpretation of a metaphor simply is not logical; it is rather emotional, indeed, somewhat neurotic. Roman Jakobson's defini? tion of a metaphor (1971) seems more acceptable. "Similarity in meaning connects the symbols of a metalanguage with the symbols of the language referred to. Similarity connects a metaphorical term with the term for which it is substituted." Veeder, in The Lessons of the Master: Popular Fiction and Personal Style in the Nineteenth Century, writes about how James transformed the elements of plot and character of conventional novels. "As he fitted his characters from a common fund of types, he shaped his style from a common fund of diction and syntactic usages." The book is loaded with the fruits of statistical research. In fact, Mr. Veeder's entire family engaged in the game, making a Jamesian out of his mother. But I wonder whether his book will make any Jamesians outside of his devoted family. He has counted the frequency of such words as "perfectly" and "perfect" in The Initials and Roderick Hudson to prove James uses the same exaggerations as Baroness Tautphoeus did, and follows with other popular novels to find James uses the same intensifiers as they do. Then he goes on to prove that the frequent use of the word "perfect" or "perfectly" in The Portrait of a Lady shows James as concerned with perfection, naming it a touchstone for the book. He finds what he calls the syntax or the rhetoric of litany abundantly in Washington Square. He finds personification in Watch and Ward as well as in other popular novels of the time. It is impossible to read his graphs showing the cor? relations, for they should be in appendixes, with the text reading con? secutively. He follows through Dr. Sloper's name: Slop, Slope, Sloper, as derived from Sterne and Trollope, etc. In The Portrait of a Lady, the</page><page sequence="20">92 / REVIEW-ESSAY most sophisticated book of James, Lydia Touchett's telegram establishes "the novel's epistemological issues with a clarity and concision." "Ex? ploring his characters' explorations has brought James his own self knowledge," is what he concludes. This book is a kind of grab bag. It includes photographs that seem to have nothing at all to do with the book and simply show a desire on the author's part to publish the unpublished. In fact, one hears on good authority that Leon Edel rightly rejected these photographs for his five volume life of James. It must be said that it does neither James nor Veeder good to have them in this book. If the photos with their unhappy expressions are a deformation of James's face, then it is an outrage to show them. If they show James in what we consider from our experience with other photographs in an unfavorable although authentic light, then they have some value as documentation. However, we know from snapshots (which he hated and for which he produced his self admitted "scowls" and "grimaces") that he never resembled the cruel-looking man shown us by the pictures here published. We simply have to quote from one of Anthony Powell's plays the lines about the scholar who received "accusations of inaccuracy . . . weak arrangement of material . . . slipshod scholarship . . . blurred photographs." Perhaps not all but surely the last seems to fit this book. There are books that investigate the outside world, and those that pay close attention to words, to syntax and language. But where are the books that pay close attention to the form James is always writing about? His form is the incorporation of conscious signification, con? scious reference to things and works especially in The Bowl and The Dove and The Sacred Fount, things that were stirring in the cultivated world of France and England and whose echoing reverberations have become muted since we have moved away in time from Symbolism. We must get back to the sources in order to understand what James has put into the form and structure of the novel, but the sources themselves are useless unless we see how he works them into his material. In a review of Sheppard's book Martha Banta called our attention to his failure to show how these things made "The Screw" as good as it is. That is still a mystery that investigators have not yet dissected. All writers trying to interpret the meaning of a work of literature hope to ar? rive at the truth. Needless to say, the degree of verification depends often on the relation of the method of verifying to the size of the area of scrutiny, and to the condition of the author's equipment for investiga? tion. That every experiment formulates its conditions is something literary investigators often forget.</page><page sequence="21">REVIEW-ESSAY / 93 Can these books help the serious reader of James over any of the ob? stacles to understanding found in his work? Let us confess that the chief obstacle is not only the need to read James slowly but to reread James, which James himself reiterates. If the Duchess of Sutherland, a woman living in the society he wrote about, with plenty of leisure and the best of intentions, for whom James's references were still alive, was told by him to read five pages of The Ambassadors a day, how much more time must we give to reading and rereading James? Since his work is the most serious fiction ever written by an American, we have to believe that it is worth our time. I may be accused of a scientific fallacy when I propose a distinction between investigator and critic; between the man or woman who digs up facts and the one who postulates a theory that illuminates some aspect of the work, between one who does not make a judgment about the work and the one whose conclusions are based on the findings of others. Why must both jobs be done by the same worker? Some minds do one thing better than others, some can do only one kind of thing, and it seems it is the rare mind who can do both, like Wilson or Edel. But those of us who can do a limited study should not be forced into falsifying our instincts for truth by feeling inadequate if we do not account for the totality of which only a part has been under our control. I take for an instance the beautiful little article by Miriam Allott which in Notes and Queries es? tablished the identity of the Bronzino in The Dove. There should be more short, significant papers that change our reading and bring it closer to the author's intention. Yet the overall view of James is necessary. Louis Auchincloss's is fine except that it ignores the scholarship that should change that overview and bring it up to date. The technique of some critics is to take one phrase out of James and make it the touchstone. Wilson never did that; he went from important insight directly into its demonstration. The unease certain critics today feel in reading James is also expressed in Poole's review of Rowe's book in the TLS for October 8, 1976, for he accepts the notions that there are "voids, gaps and absences in James." He thinks Rowe is aware of these, for he sees both Adams and James are remaking past traditions and moving from an anthropomorphic center, "from a principle governing structurality into a Function describing structurality." From some of these books we see emerging a new James who personally manipulates the reader as well as his characters, a James who puts his personal antagonisms (as Sheppard would have us believe in relation to the Shavian material) in his villains, a James whose language is now being studied in minute detail and whose milieu is being carefully combed for correlations in his work. There is a new James emerging from some of the more original new books, a James who could in the words of Poole, "grasp and practice, with fascination</page><page sequence="22">94 / REVIEW-ESSAY and respect . . . the articulation of a different kind of 'movement' through the forms and activities of deceit, betrayal and treachery (of his characters toward each other, of the narrative toward the reader)." In this struggle is disclosed "the intimate, ineffaceable spaces across which words and gestures are forced to leap to their fragile credibilities. James presses us towards feeling that those spaces, like the crack in the golden bowl, are not merely inevitable but precious." This may be the new James but have we done justice to the old?
