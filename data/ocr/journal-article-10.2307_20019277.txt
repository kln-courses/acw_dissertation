THE ISSUE OF INCARNATION The issue of incarnation in the formative centuries of the Judaism of the dual Torah concerns not the invention of an essentially new conception of God but the recovery of what was among other Judaisms an entirely conventional one. What concerns us is not so much why in light of the prior Judaic systems and their statements, the Judaism of the dual Torah represented God in incarnate form. It is how the incarnation of God attained realization. For in the earlier stages of the unfolding of the canon of the Judaism of the dual Torah, e.g. in the Mishnah, Tosefta, and related exegetical writings, we have no hint of an incarnation of God, and it is only in the final and complete statement of that Judaism that we confront, in full and whole realization, the notion of God with an individuality, a personality, a corporeal character.1 The answer to that question requires us to pursue two distinct lines of inquiry. The first concerns incarnation - treating as human and fleshly and corporeal what is to begin with either an object or an abstraction - as a mode of thought, not with special reference to God. Here we want to know the point at which, in the unfolding of the canon of the Judaism of the dual Torah, the conception of incarnation serves as a mode of presenting as a human person or personality some thing or some idea. Within this inquiry, further, we want to know precisely how the conception of incarnation comes to expression. The second addresses the issue why is it that in the pages of the Bavli in particular the process of incarnation reaches the person of God ? II. THE SAGE AND THE INCARNATION OF THE TORAH The incarnation of not God but the Torah in the person of the sage marked the beginning of the process fully realized, for the divinity, in the Bavli's representation of God as a human being, specifically, a man, possessed of physical and other corporeal traits, and emotional life consubstantial with that of human beings, and ability to do the acts that human beings do in the way in which they do them - thus God incarnate. The process of turning an object or an abstract conception into a human being, representing what in 1 This is the argument of my The Incarnation of God. The Character of Divinity in Formative Judaism (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1988). I here summarize only part of the results of that extended survey.</page><page sequence="2">214 JACOB NEUSNER fact was not human as a sentient and human being, consubstantial with human persons and capable of human discourse, thus incarnation as cor? poreal, consubstantial in emotion and virtue, fleshly in action, got under way, for the Judaism of the dual Torah, when the Torah was made flesh. In the Talmud of the Land of Israel or Yerushalmi, c. a.D. 400, the Torah came to be represented in the person of the sage, who was, in himself, the Torah incarnate. Before the process of incarnation had reached God, therefore, in the Judaism of the dual Torah, the Torah itself had attained human form and representation in the person of the sage. The pages of the Talmud of the Land of Israel show us in statement and in story the process by which the sage came to be represented as the living Torah. Precisely how the incar? nation of the Torah in the person of the sage, who is represented as the Torah incarnate, came to full expression will require a protracted survey of the way in which the first of the two Talmuds portrays the incarnation of an object, the Torah, or the abstraction, revelation. The reason that the Torah was made flesh was that the Torah was the source of salvation. When the sage was transformed into a salvific figure through his mastery of the Torah, it was an easy step to regard the sage as the living Torah. That step most certainly was taken by the time of the authorship of the Yerushalmi, which set it forth in rich detail as an estab? lished fact of life. That is why we begin with the basic doctrine of the relationship between the figure of the sage and the salvation of Israel. In the Talmud of the Land of Israel, the rule of Heaven and the learning and authority of the rabbi on earth turned out to be identified with one another. The first stage in the incarnation of the Torah in the person of the sage is marked by that identification. Salvation for Israel depended upon adherence to the sage and acceptance of his discipline. Both God's will in Heaven and the sage's words on earth constituted Torah. And Israel would be saved through Torah, so the sage was the savior, as much as he embodied the Torah in the here and now as a kind of living and breathing Torah. The vastly expanded definition of the symbol of'Torah' stood behind the process of incarnation. For it now deemed appropriate to compare or apply that symbol to a remarkable range of things. Incarnation, however, was far more specific and concrete. It is represented by the claim that a sage himself was equivalent to a scroll of the Torah - a material, legal comparison, not merely a symbolic metaphor. Here are expressions of that conception in the Talmud of the Land of Israel. A. He who sees a disciple of a sage who has died is as if he sees a scroll of the Torah that has been burned. Y. Moed Qatan 3: 7. x I. R. Jacob bar Abayye in the name of R. Aha : ' An elder who forgot his learning because of some accident which happened to him - they treat him with the sanctity owed to an ark [of the Torah].' Y. Moed Qatan 3: 1. xi At this stage we find the sage represented as equivalent to the scroll of the Torah, and, turning the statement around, the scroll of the Torah is realized</page><page sequence="3">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 215 in the person of the sage. The conception is not merely figurative or met? aphorical, for, in both instances, actual behaviour was affected. Still more to the point, what the sage did had the status of law; the sage was the model of the law, thus once again enjoyed the standing of the human embodiment of the Torah. Since the sage exercised supernatural power as a kind of living Torah, his very deeds served to reveal law, as much as his word expressed revelation. That is a formidable component of the argument that the sage embodied the Torah, another way of saying that the Torah was incarnated in the person of the sage. The capacity of the sage himself to participate in the process of revelation is illustrated in two types of materials. First of all, tales told about rabbis' behaviour on specific occasions imme? diately are translated into rules for the entire community to keep. Accord? ingly, he was a source not merely of good example but of prescriptive law. X. R. Aha went to Emmaus, and he ate dumpling [prepared by Samaritans]. Y. R. Jeremiah ate leavened bread prepared by them. Z. R. Hezekiah ate their locusts prepared by them. AA. R. Abbahu prohibited Israelite use of wine prepared by them. Y. Abodah Zarah .5: 4. in These reports of what rabbis had done enjoyed the same authority, as statements of the law on eating what Samaritans cooked, as did citations of traditions in the names of the great authorities of old or of the day. What someone did served as a norm, if the person was a sage of sufficient standing. Far more common in the Talmud are instances in which the deed of a rabbi is adduced as an authoritative precedent for the law under discussion. It was everywhere taken for granted that what a rabbi did, he did because of his mastery of the law. Even though a formulation of the law was not in hand, a tale about what a rabbi actually did constituted adequate evidence on how to formulate the law itself. So from the practice of an authority, a law might be framed quite independent of the person of the sage. The sage then functioned as a lawgiver, like Moses. Among many instances of that mode of generating law are the following. A. Gamaliel Zuga was walking along, leaning on the shoulder of R. Simeon b. Laqish. They came across an image. B. He said to him, 'What is the law as to passing before it?' C. He said to him, ' Pass before it, but close [your] eyes. ' D. R. Isaac was walking along, leaning on the shoulder of R. Yohanan. They came across an idol before the council building. E. He said to him, 'What is the law as to passing before it?' F. He said to him, ' Pass before it, but close [your] eyes. ' G. R. Jacob bar Idi was walking along, leaning upon R. Joshua b. Levi. They came across a procession in which an idol was carried. He said to him, 'Nahum, the most holy man, passed before this idol, and will you not pass by it? Pass before it but close your eyes. ' Y. Abodah Zarah 3: 11.11</page><page sequence="4">2l6 JACOB NEUSNER FF. R. Aha had chills and fever. [They brought him] a medicinal drink pre? pared from the phallus of Dionysian revellers. But he would not drink it. They brought it to R.Jonah, and he did drink it. Said R. Mana, 'Now if R.Jonah, the patriarch, had known what it was, he would never have drunk it. ' GG. Said R. Huna, ' That is to say, " They do not accept healing from something that derives from an act of fornication. " ' Y. Abodah Zarah 2: 2. in What is important is GG, the restatement of the story as a law. The example of a rabbi served to teach how one should live a truly holy life. The requirements went far beyond the measure of the law, extending to refraining from deeds of a most commonplace sort. The example of rabbinical virtue, moreover, was adduced explicitly to account for the supernatural or magical power of a rabbi. There was no doubt, in people's imagination, therefore, that the reason rabbis could do the amazing things people said they did was that they embodied the law and exercised its supernatural or magical power. This is stated quite openly in what follows. C. There was a house that was about to collapse over there [in Babylonia], and Rab set one of his disciples in the house, until they had cleared out everything from the house. When the disciple left the house, the house collapsed. D. And there are those who say that it was R. Adda bar Ahwah. E. Sages sent and said to him, 'What sort of good deeds are to your credit [that you have that much merit] ? ' F. He said to them, ' In my whole life no man ever got to the synagogue in the morning before I did. I never left anybody there when I went out. I never walked four cubits without speaking words of Torah. Nor did I ever mention teachings of Torah in an inappropriate setting. I never laid out a bed and slept for a regular period of time. I never took great strides among the associates. I never called my fellow by a nickname. I never rejoiced in the embarrassment of my fellow. I never cursed by fellow when I was lying by myself in bed. I never walked over in the marketplace to someone who owed me money. G. 'In my entire life I never lost my temper in my household.' H. This was meant to carry out that which is stated as follows : ' I will give heed to the way that is blameless. Oh when wilt thou come to me? I will walk with integrity of heart within my house' (Ps. 10112). Y. Taanit 3: 11. iv The correlation between learning and teaching, on the one side, and super? natural power or recognition, on the other, is explicit in the following. A. R. Yosa fasted eighty fasts in order to see R. Hiyya the Elder [in a dream]. He finally saw him, and his hands trembled and his eyes grew dim. B. Now if you say that R. Yosa was an unimportant man, [and so was unworthy of such a vision, that is not the case]. For a weaver came before R. Yohanan. He said to him, ' I saw in my dream that the heaven fell, and one of your disciples was holding it up.' C. He said to him, 'Will you know him [when you see him]?' D. He said to him, 'When I see him, I shall know him. ' Then all of his disciples passed before him, and he recognized R. Yosa. E. R. Simeon b Laqish fasted three hundred fasts in order to have a vision of R. Hiyya the Elder, but he did not see him.</page><page sequence="5">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 217 F. Finally he began to be distressed about the matter. He said, 'Did he labour in learning of Torah more than I?' G. They said to him, ' He brought Torah to the people of Israel to a greater extent than you have, and not only so, but he even went into exile [to teach on a wider front]. ' H. He said to them, 'And did I not go into exile too?' I. They said to him, 'You went into exile only to learn, but he went into exile to teach others.' Y. Ketubot 12: 3. vu This story shows that the storyteller regarded as a fact of life the correlation between mastery of Torah sayings and supernatural power - visions of the deceased, in this case. That is why Simeon b. Laqish complained, E-F, that he had learned as much Torah as the other, and so had every right to be able to conjure the dead. The greater supernatural power of the other then was explained in terms of the latter's superior service to 'Torah'. It seems to me pointless to distinguish supernatural power from magic. The upshot is that the sage was made a magician by Torah learning and could save Israel through Torah, source of the most powerful magic of all. The special position of the sage as a supernaturally favoured figure also imposed on Israelite society the requirement to accord him special dignity. The disciple of a sage himself had to exemplify what was required by his behaviour toward his own master, who taught him Torah. The disciple's acts of respect for the master, devotion to his standing and honour, ongoing concern for his comfort were principal expressions of the respect for Torah upon which the entire system rested. Accordingly, the respect paid to the Torah also was due to the sage, a view quite natural in light of the established identification of sage and Torah. Seeing Scripture in their own model, sages took the position that the (written) Torah of old, its supernatural power and salvific promise, in their own day continued to endure - among themselves and in their persons. In consequence, the promise of salvation contained in every line of Scripture was to be kept in every deed of learning and obedience to the law effected under their auspices. So while they projected backward the things they cherished in an act of (to us) extraordinary anachronism, in their eyes they carried forward, to their own time, the promise of salvation for Israel contained within the written Torah. In finding sages in the (written) Torah, the Talmud's sages implicitly stated a view of themselves as the continuation of the sanctified way of life of the written Torah. It followed that the pattern and promise of salvation contained therein lay within their way of life. The sage rules uncontingently, with perfect certainty to begin with meaning, confidence in his authority. So the Judaism of the dual Torah invents Scripture as source of certainty (something of which the Mishnah scarcely dreamed) and at the same time makes the sage authority and arbiter of what is true and certain. So the Talmud effects an astonishing parallelism between</page><page sequence="6">2l8 JACOB NEUSNER Scripture and sage. The Yerushalmi brings forth the sage as Scripture incarnate, and out of the union of the Torah and the person of the rabbi, the Judaism of the dual Torah was begotten. When the union is fully realized, then the literary expression will prove striking. We are able, moreover, to show that precisely the same modes of explanation and interpretation found suitable for the Mishnah and the Scripture served equally well for the sayings and doings of sages. That fact may be shown in three ways. First, just as Scripture supplied proof texts, so deeds or statements of sages provided proof texts. Second, just as a verse of Scripture or an explicit statement of the Mishnah resolved a disputed point, so what a sage said or did might be introduced into discourse as ample proof for settling a dispute. And third, it follows that just as Scripture or the Mishnah laid down Torah, so what a sage did or said laid down Torah. In the dimensions of the applied and practical reason by which the law un? folded, the sage found a comfortable place in precisely the taxonomic categories defined, to begin with, by both the Mishnah and Scripture. Specifically, we shall now see that what a sage says is treated precisely as statements in Scripture and the Mishnah are received. That is to say, the same modes of exegetical inquiry pertaining to the Mishnah and Scripture apply without variation to statements made by rabbis of the contemporary period themselves. Indeed, precisely the same theological and exegetical considerations come to bear both upon the Mishnah's statements and opinions expressed by talmudic rabbis. Since these were not to be dis? tinguished from one another in the requirement that opinion be suitably grounded in Scripture, they also should be understood to have formed part of precisely the same corpus of Torah truths. What the Mishnah and the later rabbi said expressed precisely the same kind of truth : revelation - whether through the medium of Scripture, or that contained in the Mishnah, or that given in the opinion of the sage himself. The way in which this search for proof texts applies equally to the Mishnah and to the rabbi's opinion is illustrated in the following passage. A. The party of Korah has no portion in the world to come, and will not live in the world to come [Mishnah Sanh?drin 10: 4]. B. What is the scriptural basis for this view? C. 'So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly ' (Num. 16: 33. D. 'The earth closed over them-in this world. E. 'And they perished from the midst of the assembly' - in the world to come [Mishnah Sanh?drin 10: 4D-F]. F. It was taught: R. Judah b. B?tera says, 'The contrary view is to be derived from the implication of the following verse : G. ' " I have gone astray like a lost sheep ; seek thy servant and do not forget thy commandments" (Ps. 119: 176).</page><page sequence="7">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 219 H. 'Just as the lost object which is mentioned later on in the end is going to be searched for, so the lost object which is stated herein is destined to be searched for' [Tosefta Sanh?drin 13: 9]. I. Who will pray for them? J. R. Samuel bar Nahman said, 'Moses will pray for them. K. [This is proved from the following verse:] '"Let Reuben live, and not die, [nor let his men be few]" (Deut. 33: 6).' L. R.Joshua b. Levi said, 'Hannah will pray for them.' M. This is the view of R.Joshua b. Levi, for R.Joshua b. Levi said, 'Thus did the party of Korah sink ever downward, until Hannah went and prayed for them and said, "The Lord kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up" (1 Sam. 2: 6).' Yerushalmi Sanh?drin 10: 4.1 We have striking sequence of proof texts, serving ( 1 ) the cited statement of the Mishnah, A-C, then (2) an opinion of a rabbi in the Tosefta, F-H, then (3) the position of a rabbi, J-K and L-M. The process of providing proof texts therefore is central; the nature of the passages requiring the proof texts, a matter of indifference. We see that the search for appropriate verses of Scripture vastly transcends the purpose of studying the Mishnah and Scrip? ture, the exegesis of their rules, or the provision of adequate authority for the Mishnah and its laws. In fact, any proposition that is to be taken seriously, whether in the Mishnah, in the Tosefta, or in the mouth of a talmudic sage himself, will elicit interest in scriptural support. Why does the quest in Scripture for proof texts matter here? It is because we see that the real issue turns out to have been not the Mishnah at all, nor even the vindication of its diverse sayings, one by one. Why not? Once the words of a sage, not merely a rule of Mishnah, are made to refer to Scripture for proof, it must follow that, in the natural course of things, a rule of the Mishnah or of the Tosefta will likewise be asked to refer to Scripture. That the living sage validated his own words through Scripture explains why the sage in the fourth century validated also the words of the (then) ancient sages of the Mishnah and Tosefta through verses of Scripture. It is one, undivided phenomenon. Distinctions are not made among media - (1) oral, (2) written, or (3) living - of the Torah. The Torah - in our language, the canon of revealed truth - is in three media, not two. Scripture, the Mishnah, the sage - the three spoke with equal authority. True, one had to come into alignment with the other, the Mishnah with Scripture, the sage with the Mishnah. But it was not the case that one component of the Torah, of God's word to Israel, stood within the sacred circle, another beyond. Interpretation and what was interpreted, exegesis and text, belonged together. While Scripture and the Mishnah govern what the sage knows, in the Yerushalmi (as in the Bavli) it is the sage who authoritatively speaks about them. What sages were willing to do to the Mishnah in the Yerushalmi and Bavli is precisely what they were prepared to do to Scripture - impose upon it their own judgement of its meaning. It is the source of the authority of the</page><page sequence="8">220 JACOB NEUSNER sage himself that turns out to pose the fundamental question. With the answer to that question, we also know, first, the status, as to revelation, of the things the sage says, whether he speaks of the Mishnah or of Scripture ; second, we know the standing of the books he writes, whether these are tractates of the Yerushalmi or the Bavli or the compositions of exegeses of Scripture. The sage speaks with authority about the Mishnah and the Scripture. As much as they, he therefore has authority deriving from rev? elation. He himself may participate in the process of revelation. There is no material difference. Since that is so, the sage's book, whether the Yerushalmi or the Bavli to the Mishnah or Midrash to Scripture, is Torah, that is, revealed by God. It also forms part of the Torah, a fully canonical document. The reason, then, is that the sage is like Moses, 'our rabbi', who received Torah and wrote the Torah. So while the canon was in three parts - Scripture, Mishnah, sage - the sage, in saying what the other parts meant and in embodying that meaning in his life and thought, took primacy of place. If no document organized itself around sayings and stories of sages, it was because that was superfluous. Why so? Because all documents, equally, whether Scripture, whether Mishnah, whether Yerushalmi, gave full and complete expression of deeds and deliberations of sages, beginning, after all, with Moses, our rabbi. The important point is simple. The sage forms a living Torah, a Torah become flesh. To state my prospective argument quite simply, first came the incarnation of the sage, in the Yerushalmi and related writings, then as we shall see presently - came God in the Bavli. It follows that an account of how the story came to serve as the chosen medium for the statement of the proposition of incarnation of the sage will provide a model for our review of the character and use of the story, in the Bavli, for the statement of the incarnation of God. III. THE SAGE-STORY AND ITS TRAITS Among the three media in which the Judaic system of the dual Torah came to systematic expression - the written Torah and its exegesis, the oral Torah and its exegesis, the person of the sage - it is the figure of the sage that now attracts our attention. The reason is that when an authorship wished to present the picture of the Torah as a human being, that authorship appealed to the figure of the sage. It would be quite natural later on to resort to the same medium, namely, the story, to represent the incarnation of God as well, and that is, in the main, what happened. So let us consider the stories about sages, then the ones that present the incarnation of God (henceforward : sage-stories).1 1 I review the argument of my Judaism and Story : The Evidence of the Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990).</page><page sequence="9">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 221 Among the modes of conveying thought available to an authorship within the Judaism at hand, as we have seen - commentary to the Mishnah and secondary expansion of its statements, commentary to Scripture, telling stories about sages - it was that third mode of expression that predominated. Accordingly, the representation of the sage as the incarnation of the Torah is expressed principally in stories about the sage and his deeds. The import? ance of that fact for our larger inquiry into the representation of God in the form of a human being will become clear in the next section. What we shall see, as we review the materials before us, is that when an authorship wished to accomplish the incarnation of God, the authorship appealed to the story as the medium for its message of incarnation, its Judaic 'gospel' of the Holy One, blessed be he, walking among human beings, arguing with them, teaching them, performing miracles for them, expressing love of them. One reason, as I have suggested, is that the work of incarnation to begin with had dealt with the sage, and portrayals of the sage as the incarnation of the Torah made use of the medium of the story. Consequently, the medium of story for the message of incarnation would in due course serve yet another topic. The document I have chosen for the present analysis is The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan, a document whose closet affinities place it in the circle of the authorship of the Talmud of Babylonia, c. sixth century. I choose that compilation for one important reason. The base-document upon which The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan is built, namely, The Fathers, a mid-third-century collection of aphorisms attributed to sages of the late second-century Mishnah, does not tell stories about its sages. But The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan does. That is why the later, complementary compilation provides a remarkably apt opportunity to in? vestigate in the context of religious literature the entry of the story as an important medium for presenting a message in Judaism, since that document contains an unusually rich selection of stories about sages. The Fathers, like the Mishnah and the Tosefta, contains no sustained narratives about sages and has very few narratives of other types. The narrative level pertaining to apophthegms set in a ' dramatic ' framework is reached by, 'One day he saw...and said...,' with the 'one day' serving to establish the episodic character in which the saying is presented. Had the apophthegm stated simply, ' Whenever he saw a skull, he said..., ' it would have obviated the need for the (pseudo-) narrative setting in which it presently appears. In the movement from The Fathers to The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan, therefore, we are able to see how the framers of the later work of exegesis of an earlier writing found a place in their composition for a genre of materials not found appropriate for use as a paramount medium among prior framers or authorships of canonical docu? ments. Following this development, for the incarnation of the Torah in</page><page sequence="10">222 JACOB NEUSNER sage, The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan provides guideposts in our examination of the parallel development, for the incarnation of God - also very much in the model of the sage - in the Bavli. Drawing the parallel at hand between the sage-story and the God-incar? nate-story proves apt for yet another reason. In the age prior to the Bavli, c. a.D. 600, the documents of the canon of the Judaism of the dual Torah rarely endowed God with a personality. Only in the Bavli do we find a rich representation of God as a human person. The same pattern unfolds for the telling of tales about sages, only the earlier of the two Talmuds, the Yeru? shalmi, c. a.D. 400, is the turning point. Until the Yerushalmi, the com? ponents of the same canon rarely tell detailed stories about sages ; when they do, moreover, these stories principally illustrate points of law or doctrine and contain remarkably slight representation of the sage's individual traits of personality and character, let alone deed. The Judaism portrayed in the writings of the sages, or rabbis, of late antiquity, from the first to the seventh century, in the beginning took slight interest in the lives and persons of those sages. The use of the sage-story as a principal mode of communication furthermore will have surprised the compilers of earlier compositions in the unfolding canon of the Judaism of the Dual Torah. For the authorship of the Mishnah, to which The Fathers had itself been attached as the first and most important apologetic, took slight interest in telling stories about sages. That is not to say the authorship of the Mishnah did not include narratives, for it assuredly did so, particularly for the purpose of a precedent of a law, or the illustration of the law, on the one side, or of providing a setting for the presentation of a saying, on the other. But many centuries later, the authorship of The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan made remarkably extensive use of the story about the sage, his origins, sagacity, historical importance, and mode of dying. In doing so, they supplied The Fathers, a tractate attached to the Mishnah and congruent, in its judgement of nar? rative, to the Mishnah, with a layer of narrative in the genre of the story about the sage. By the end of the period at hand, by contrast, the canonical writings of Judaism, represented first by the Yerushalmi and then by the Bavli, drew upon a rich corpus of stories about the beginnings (meaning, of Torah-study), sagacity, historical power, and endings (meaning, death while engaged in Torah-study) of those same figures. The story of an im? portant event in the life of a sage, told, for example, in the Talmud of the Land of Israel, in the end of the fourth century, and its successor, two centuries later, took an important role in the presentation of the message of the Torah. Here an important qualification is required. While the two Talmuds present stories about sages, neither one contains anything we might call a 'gospel' of a sage or even a chapter of a gospel. There is no sustained biography of any sage, and the stories we do have remain episodic and ad</page><page sequence="11">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 223 hoc. In the two Talmuds, serving as exegesis of the Mishnah, and in the contemporary Midrash-compilations, providing exegesis of Scripture, the sage-story does not play a prominent role. This may be seen in a simple fact. While both Talmuds resort for their fundamental redactional structure to the Mishnah, and while, in addition, the Bavli appeals to sustained passages of Scripture as the basis for organizing its materials, neither of the two Talmuds formulates as a continuous, more than merely episodic, narrative stories about a given authority. What is important for our study of the incarnation of God through the medium of story-telling requires a brief survey of one trait of the sage-story. The survey concerns its narrative qualities. In my analysis of the diverse narratives in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan I was able to ac? complish a taxonomy of narrative, generated by the document under close analysis here. I found five kinds of narrative, or to put it differently, five species of the genus, narrative. I classified these species as [i] parable, [2] precedent, [3] narrative setting for a saying, [4] scriptural story, and [5] sage-story. What I shall ask in the section following this one is how the stories they serve as the medium for the incarnation of God (God-story) compare to the sage-stories. I seek to set into the broader taxonomic framework the particular stories that serve as a medium for the message of God as a human being. The reason that we can accomplish such a comparison between the sage-story and the stories before us is simple. It is that formal, not merely thematic, differences generate the taxonomy at hand. A story about a scriptural hero differs in its narrative qualities from a story about a sage hero. The difference is simple. The conventions exhibited in the stories about sages but not in other types of narratives in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan require movement. The narrator requires that something actually happen, so that a problem and its solution are recorded through an account of what people not only said but also did (sometimes, to be sure, stated implicitly and not through detailed description). So I understand by 'sage story' a narrative with these distinctive and indicative (but by no means unique) traits: [1] a beginning, middle and end, [2] tension and resolution, [3] characterization accomplished through an account of motivation, [4] about a particular person, [5] concerning what that person said and did on a distinct and important, one-time occasion. [6] A sage-story rarely cites verse of Scripture and differs from a scriptural story in its omission of close attention to citations of verse of Scripture as a main focus of discourse. I derived the foregoing catalogue of those indicative traits of the sage-story</page><page sequence="12">224 JACOB NEUSNER from an inductive analysis ofthose sage-stories in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan that exhibit no parallels or counterparts in other writings. In comparing the version of the origins of Aqiba, which is unique to The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan, and the version of the origin of Eliezer, which appears both in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan and elsewhere, for example, as well as the two stories of the destruction of Jerusalem, the one in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan, the other in the Talmud of Babylonia, both of them involving Yohanan ben Zakkai, I was able to distinguish our document's sage-stories from counterpart narratives else? where by resort to the stated criteria for the definition of a story, meaning, a sage-story. For these distinctive and indicative traits do not characterize other stories, e.g. ones about scriptural heroes, let alone parables, settings for sayings (in which nothing much happens), or legal precedents and illus? trations of the law through concrete accounts of circumstance. Other kinds of narratives, precedents and illustrations of the law, parables, narrative settings for stationary sayings, and stories told as part of the exegesis of Scripture (e.g. about scriptural heroes), do not conform to these traits at all. None of the other kinds of narratives tells us about motivation and characterization, none of them portrays a situation with movement provided by tension and resolution, and, therefore, none has beginning, middle, and end. Ordinarily, the narrative other than the sage-story portrays a stationary tableau. The one exception, the parable, speaks of paradigms, not persons, illustrating a teaching in a rhetorically similar, if more affecting, way as does a narrative setting for a saying. It is in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan that the story about the sage, with its stylistically indicative traits, forms the largest proportion of narratives of any document among the principal writings in the canon of Judaism in late antiquity. All the others resort to narratives of various kinds in the service of making diverse points. But our authorship is the one to employ the story about the sage to make its two new and critical points, the one about the supernatural character of the Torah-sage, the other about the eschatological character of the teleology of the Judaism of the dual Torah contained within the canonical writings before us. The new messages of The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan, concerning the nation, enduring this age and waiting for the age to come, occur not only in sayings but also in stories. A medium hot utilized in The Fathers but extensively used in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan carries a new message. Let me now spell out in a concrete way the indicative traits of the sage story. A story may share the tasks of an illustration in that it presents a narrative: such and such is what happened. It also is alike in its interest in the concrete and specific way of framing a point. But it is different in one fundamental and definitive way. Its importance requires emphasis: while meaning to provide a good example of how one should behave, the teller of a story always deals with a concrete person and a particular incident.</page><page sequence="13">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 225 The person is concrete in that he (in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan there is not a single story about a woman) is always specified by name. It concerns a particular incident in that the viewpoint of the narrator makes clear the one-timeness and specificity of the event that is reported. The story always happens in historical time, and the point it wishes to make is subordinate to the description of action, the development of a point of tension, at which the story commences, and its resolution, at which the story concludes: beginning, middle, and end. The sage-story teller, moreover, is never bound by the requirements of a larger redactional purpose and intent. While we cannot say that the story is told 'for its own sake', since I cannot define the traits of a story told 'for its own sake', we must conclude that the generative and definitive power of the story derives from internal and in? trinsic tensions and interests and not extrinsic ones. That is, the story-teller wishes to compose the narrative along lines required by the generative tension of the story at hand, not those imposed by the redactional purpose supplied by the (planned) setting of the story. The power of the story - its definitive function - is intrinsic to the narrative and self-evident within the narrative. Any further point that the story serves to prove or illustrate lies outside of the imaginative framework. The medium bears a very particular message. Stories on sages in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan yield a single message: people may begin study of the Torah at any point in life, and, if they work hard, they will achieve success, riches and fame. If they cut off their ties from their family, they will end up inheriting their family's estate, and if their wives tolerate their long absences and support them and their family, their wives will share in their success, riches, and fame. It follows that the stories on the common theme of the origins of great masters, as preserved in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan, address the question of the breakup of the families of mature men who choose to study the Torah and respond by promising success, riches, and fame, for those who in mature years do convert to study of the Torah. The lesson of the origins of the great masters is to give up home and family in favour of the Torah. The subject-matter - sages - generates its own literary conventions, that differ from those that guide writers of stories about scriptural figures. We furthermore find propositions emerging from stories on sages. The distinctive narrative conventions make one cogent and critical point. The sage learns through study of the Torah, which is accomplished solely by service of the master, to be patient and affable and forebearing. The story about a sage has a beginning, middle, and end, and the story about a sage also rests not only on verbal exchanges ('he said to him..., he said to him...'), but on (described or implicit) action ; the story about a sage unfolds from a point of tension and conflict to a clear resolution and remission of the conflict; the story about a sage rarely invokes a verse of Scripture. That means that where a distinct subject comes into view, the narrator of stories about sages will nonetheless follow a fixed set of</page><page sequence="14">226 JACOB NEUSNER everywhere applicable narrative conventions. The point of differentiation among stories derives from the contrast between the topic, sage, and the topic, Scripture and its heroes and other topics. Stories are told in one way for the one topical category, in another for the other. The general remarks about the characteristics of the sage-story take on concreteness in a single example. I choose a brief story, in my translation, on the death of two sages (bold face = citation of tractate Avot, that is, The Fathers). The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan XXXVIII : V. i A. A sword comes into the world because of the delaying of justice and perversion of justice, and because of those who teach the Torah not in accord with the law. XXXVIII: V. 2 A. When they seized Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel and R. Ishmael on the count of death, Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel was in session and was perplexed, saying, ' Woe is us ! For we are put to death like those who profane the Sabbath and worship idols and practise fornication and kill. ' C. Said to him R. Ishmael b. Elisha, 'Would it please you if I said something before you?' D. He said to him, 'Go ahead.' E. He said to him, ' Is it possible that when you were sitting at a banquet, poor folk came and stood at your door, and you did not let them come in and eat?' F. He said to him, 'By heaven [may I be cursed] if I ever did such a thing! Rather, I set up guards at the gate. When poor folk came along, they would bring them in to me and eat and drink with me and say a blessing for the sake of Heaven. ' G. He said to him, ' Is it possible that when you were in session and expounding [the Torah] on the Temple mount and the vast populations of Israelites were in session before you, you took pride in yourself?' H. He said to him, 'Ishmael my brother, one has to be ready to accept his failing. [That is why I am being put to death, the pride that I felt on such an occasion.] ' I. They went on appealing to the executioner for grace. This one [Ishmael] said to him, ' I am a priest, son of a high priest, kill me first, so that I do not have to witness the death of my companion. ' J. And the other [Simeon] said, 'I am the patriarch, son of the patriarch, kill me first, so that I do not have to witness the death of my companion. ' K. He said to him, ' Cast lots. ' They cast lots, and the lot fell on Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel. L. The executioner took the sword and cut off his head. M. R. Ishmael b. Elisha took it and held it in his breast and wept and cried out : 'Oh holy mouth, oh faithful mouth, oh mouth that brought forth beautiful gems, precious stones and pearls ! Who has laid you in the dust, who has filled your mouth with dirt and dust?' N. ' Concerning you Scripture says, Awake, 0 sword, against my shepherd and against the man who is near to me (Zech. 13: 7).' O. He had not finished speaking before the executioner took the sword and cut off his head. P. Concerning them Scripture says, My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless (Ex. 22: 23). The story establishes the tension at the outset : why do we die as do sinners?</page><page sequence="15">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 227 This question is resolved in the colloquy at C-H, at which the first act concludes. The sequence of tension and resolution is exceedingly important for our analysis of the God-story, as we shall presently see. The second act has the sages appeal to the executioner to spare the one the sight of the martyrdom of the other, I-L. The third and final component has IshmaePs lament: the mouth that taught the Torah will be avenged. The sage who dies in peace addresses his lessons to the Torah-community : the decline of the great tradition because of the failure of the sages and their disciples. The sage who dies as a martyr teaches a lesson of hope to Israel at large : God will ultimately exact justice of those who sin by persecuting Israel, just as God exacts strict justice even for the peccadillo of pride. The lessons imparted are these: XXXVIII: V. 2: Sages suffer the death penalty for the sin of pride; XXXVIII : V. 2 : Sages are martyred but know that, in due course, God will punish those who have sinned against them. If I had to single out the main point sages wished through the topic at hand to underline, it is God's perfect justice. Sages' deaths, therefore, are so portrayed as to bring that comfort that is contained within the conviction of divine vengeance for injustice and divine faithfulness in exacting justice on sinners and evil-doers, Israelite and gentile alike. For if the sage is punished for mere pride, there can be no limit to the matter. Sage-stories, with their beginnings, middles, and endings, their actions whether described or merely implied within verbal exchanges, their tensions and resolutions, follow the pattern familiar within the earlier categories. That positive trait is joined to a negative one. The story about a sage never serves to prove a proposition concerning the meaning of a verse of Scripture. With this example in hand, we may turn back to the Bavli's stories to accomplish the incarnation of God. IV. FROM ALLUSION TO REALIZATION: THE STORY AS THE MEDIUM OF THE INCARNATION OF GOD Many stories that represent God as a human being allude to the incarnation of God. But only a few show us precisely where and how the incarnation of God comes to expression in detailed pictures of action and movement. These latter stories form the focus of interest. Merely alluding to God as incarnate, e.g. having arms or legs, engaging in set-piece dialogue based on verses of Scripture or exchanges of theological positions, hardly draws us close to the orbit of the moving tales of the sage as Torah incarnate. Stories that tell us the tale of God moving among (some) human beings, working among them, engaging in argument with them, transacting exchanges among them - those stories form a tiny but critical corpus. For they permit us to address what I think is the fundamental question before us. When sages in the authorship of the Bavli represent God as a human being, do they point us toward God as essentially in the model of the sage ? Or do the stories about</page><page sequence="16">228 JACOB NEUSNER the incarnation of God carry us beyond that model and into an entirely other realm of being and of meaning? That is what forms the question at hand. The really interesting question is whether or not we can provide, out of the materials of the Bavli, a kind of'gospel of the Holy One, blessed be he', parallel to the canonical Gospels of Jesus Christ, God Incarnate, of Christianity. To specify my criterion for answering the question at hand, our task is now to ask whether a story that accomplishes the representation of God as a human person, that is, the incarnation of God, carries forward the narrative policies of the sage-story, or whether the Bavli's pictures of God as a human being (which we shall henceforward call God-incarnate-stories) follow their own programme and conventions. We recall these criteria for the sage-story, as distinct from all other narratives in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan: [i] a beginning, middle, and end, [2] tension and resolution, [3] characterization accomplished through an account of motivation, [4] about a particular person, and [5] concerning what that person said and did on a distinct and important, one-time occasion. A sage-story [6] rarely cites verse of Scripture and differs from a scriptural story in its omission of close attention to citations of verses of Scripture as a main focus of discourse. A survey of the stories in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan yields in detail ample justification for the claim that, as the medium is different, so too is the message. On the surface we come across numerous obvious dif? ferences in narrative convention dictating the technique of telling stories about sages in particular. Three, among the six just now listed, seem to me definitive. (1) The story about a sage has a beginning, middle, and end, and the story about a sage also rests not only on verbal exchanges (' he said to him..., he said to him...'), but on (described) action. (2) The story about a sage unfolds from a point of tension and conflict to a clear resolution and remission of the conflict. (3) The story about a sage rarely invokes a verse of Scripture and never serves to prove a proposition concerning the meaning of a verse of Scripture. These traits prove distinctive. For, when I analysed, in the same com? pilation, the traits of stories about scriptural figures and themes (surveyed in my book but not cited here), they proved quite opposite. ( 1 ) In the story about a scriptural hero there is no beginning, middle, and end, and little action. The burden of the narrative is carried by 'he said to him..., he said to him... ' Described action is rare and plays a slight role in the unfolding of the narrative. Often the narrative consists of little more than a setting for a saying, and the point of the narrative is conveyed not through what is told but through the cited saying. (2) The story about a scriptural hero is worked out as a tableau, with description of the components of the stationary tableau placed at the centre. There is little movement, no point of tension that is resolved.</page><page sequence="17">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 22g (3) The story about a scriptural hero always invokes verses from Scripture and makes the imputation of meaning to those verses the centre of interest. We therefore can differentiate the sage-story from the Scripture-story of The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan. With the specified traits before us, we may now revert to a brief review of the stories presented in Chapter Nine. For the purpose of the present analysis I take one example among several. We begin with the representation, through mere allusions to accepted traits or facts, of God as man. The single most striking statement that God looks like a man is in the following : 1. A. Said R. Hoshaiah, ' When the Holy One, blessed be he, came to create the first man, the ministering angels mistook him [for God, since man was in God's image,] and wanted to say before him, "Holy, [holy, holy is the Lord of hosts]." B. ' To what may the matter be compared ? To the case of a king and a governor who were set in a chariot, and the provincials wanted to greet the king, " Sovereign ! " But they did not know which one of them was which. What did the king do? He turned the governor out and put him away from the chariot, so that people would know who was king. C. ' So too when the Holy One, blessed be he, created the first man, the angels mistook him [for God]. What did the Holy One, blessed be he, do? He put him to sleep, so everyone knew that he was a mere man. D. 'That is in line with the following verse of Scripture :" Cease you from man, in whose nostrils is a breath, for how little is he to be accounted" (Is. 2: 22).' Genesis Rabbah VIII: x This is not a story about God, e.g. things God did, arguments God con? ducted, God's behaviour in a given circumstance and how it solved a problem, and the like. We do not have the makings of a gospel-chapter at all. It is the statement of the abstract proposition, in the form of a story, that, since man looked like God, God had to show the difference. This he did simply by putting man to sleep - with the further implication, I think, that death marks the difference. Here we have a kind of narrative. But in the numerous other pericopes that impute physical attributes to God, we have not narratives at all. In proposing to show that a sizeable document imputed corporeal form to God, I had of course to assemble a variety of genres of writing. But none of those items can be classified as a story. Not only so, but in stories that represent God's emotional structure and other virtues, God rarely serves as the hero of the story or plays the role of protagonist. Showing that it is a virtue to be humble, the story-teller provides a narrative of how God showed humility. A. Said R. Joshua b. Levi, 'When Moses came down from before the Holy One, blessed be he, Satan came and asked [God], "Lord of the world, Where is the Torah?" B. ' He said to him, " I have given it to the earth..." [Satan ultimately was told by God to look for the Torah by finding the son of Amram.] C. 'He went to Moses and asked him, "Where is the Torah which the Holy One, blessed be he, gave you?" 9 RES 24</page><page sequence="18">23O JACOB NEUSNER D. 'He said to him, "Who am I that the Holy One, blessed be he, should give me the Torah?" E. 'Said the Holy One, blessed be he, to Moses, "Moses, you are a liar!" F. 'He said to him, "Lord of the world, you have a treasure in store which you have enjoyed every day. Shall I keep it to myself?" G. 'He said to him, "Moses, since you have acted with humility, it will bear your name: 'Remember the Torah of Moses, my servant' (Mai. 3: 22).'" b. Shab 89a God is not the protagonist of this story; God is only the straight-man. Jesus is always the protagonist of stories in the Gospels. Here not God but Satan is the principal actor, setting up the circumstance for Moses's stunning saying. In the drama, God speaks the critical line - but as a bit-player. The same critical - yet tangential - role is assigned to God in the story about Eliezer's and Joshua's argument. When Heaven's intervention is rejected, God enters the story - only to underline the main point of the story, which is made through the actions and dramatic dialogue assigned to others: B. He said to him, 'He laughed out loud, saying, "My children have won over me, my children have won over me."' b. B.M. 59b At the risk of taxing the reader's patience, I give yet a third example of how stories in which God is represented as incarnate, indeed, as a sage, treat God as a mere straight-man: A. In the session in the firmament, people were debating this question : if the bright spot came before the white hair, the person is unclean. If the white hair came before the bright spot, he is clean. What about a case of doubt? B. The Holy One, blessed be he, said, ' Clean. ' C. And the rest of the fellowship of the firmament said, 'Unclean.' D. They said, 'Who will settle the matter?' E. It should be Rabbah b. Nahmani, for he is the one who said, ' I am an expert in the laws of plagues and in the effects of contamination through the overshadowing of a corpse.'... F. A letter fell down from the sky to Pumbedita : 'Rabbah b. Nahmani has been called up by the academy of the firmament. ' b. B. M. 86a God plays a role here as an ordinary sage. But God's part in the story is minimal and even the representation of God as incarnate is tangential. It is a story about the sage in the heavenly academy; the sage is like God, doing the things that (by the way) God is represented as doing. God is not the hero, nor even part of the detail; God is a mere backdrop. Other descriptions of things God says and does follow suit. People refer to God, but God does not emerge richly characterized as the centrepiece of narrative. One last example of the numerous allusions to God, whether in the form of narrative or in other forms altogether : A. Said R. Isaac bar Samuel in the name of Rab, ' The night is divided into three watches, and over each watch, the Holy One, blessed be he, sits and roars like a lion.</page><page sequence="19">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 231 B. 'He says, "Woe to the children, on account of whose sins I have wiped out my house and burned my palace, and whom I have exiled among the nations of the world."' b. Ber. 3a, vu K. T said to him, "I heard the sound of an echo moaning like a pigeon and saying, 'Woe to the children, on account of whose sins I have wiped out my house and burned my palace and whom I have exiled among the nations of the world ""... M. '"And not only so, but when Israelites go into synagogues and schoolhouses and respond, ' May the great name be blessed, ' the Holy One shakes his head and says, ' Happy is the king, whom they praise in his house in such a way ! What does a father have, who has exiled his children ? And woe to the children who are exiled from their father's table!"" b. Ber. 3a, vm While represented as a fully formed personality in these stories, God none? theless does not enter into the narrative as an actor, a person who walks and talks among human beings. We may say very simply that when the author? ships at hand wished to make their points about God as a personality, they found no strong reason to tell stories about God as they told stories about sages. To state matters in our own, secular terms, the narrative role of God in these stories does not conform to that of the sage in sage-stories. That is not to suggest God appears only as a straight-man. We do have stories that can be transformed into materials for a gospel. These are of precisely the types we find about Jesus : stories in which God does things, stories in which God says things. When God is represented in negotiations with mortals, engaged in exchanges and gaining his wishes through give and take, God enjoys a more active role in the narrative. Unlike the foregoing pericopes, in the following one we have God as a hero and principal actor : F. Rabbah bar Mari said, 'What is the meaning of this verse: "But they were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea ; nonetheless he saved them for his name's sake" (Ps. 106: 7)? G. 'This teaches that the Israelites were rebellious at that time, saying, "Just as we will go up on this side, so the Egyptians will go up on the other side," Said the Holy One, blessed be he, to the angelic prince who reigns over the sea, "Cast them [the Israelites] out on dry land. " H. ' He said before him, " Lord of the world, is there any case of a slave [namely, myself] to whom his master [you] gives a gift [the Israelites], and then the master goes and takes [the gift] away again ? [You gave me the Israelites, now you want to take them away and place them on dry land.] " I. 'He said to him, "I'll give you one and a half times their number." J. ' He said before him, " Lord of the world, is there a possibility that a slave can claim anything against his master? [How do I know that you will really do it?]" K. 'He said to him, "The Kishon brook will be my pledge [that I shall carry out my word. Nine hundred chariots at the brook were sunk (Jud. 3: 23), while Pharaoh at the sea had only six hundred, thus a pledge one and a half times greater than the sum at issue.] " L. ' Forthwith [the angelic prince of the sea] spit them out onto dry land, for it is written, "And the Israelites saw the Egyptians dead on the sea shore" (Ex. 14: 30).' B. Arakhin 15A-B 9-2</page><page sequence="20">232 JACOB NEUSNER The pericope is a story, not merely an allusion to a fact or a syllogistic proposition or an exegesis. From G forward, the narrative takes its own course. It starts with a crisis, the problem of the Israelites at the sea. God intervenes as the hero to solve the crisis. The tension in the story derives from H and is worked out at the exchanges of H-I, then J-K. We have a beginning, middle, and end. There is a point of tension and conflict, ending in a resolution. But there is a very considerable point of difference between this narrative and the sage-story, and it is in the critical role, beginning and end, of verses of Scripture. The story is spun out to explain Ps. 106: 7. Its climatic moment is Jud. 3: 23, then Ex. 14: 30. In no way does this story, in which God plays the role of protagonist, conform to the pattern established for sage-stories in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan. That same reversion to Scripture as the critical source for narrative movement, on the one side, and the propositions for narrative statement, on the other, also characterizes stories of conflict between God and other per? sonalities. To show that the pattern persists, I give a further illustration : A. Said R. Isaac, 'When the temple was destroyed, the Holy One, blessed be he, found Abraham standing in the Temple. He said to him, "What is my beloved doing in my house?" B. ' He said to him, " I have come because of what is going on with my children. " C. 'He said to him, "Your children sinned and have been sent into exile." D. 'He said to him, "But wasn't it by mistake that they sinned?" E. 'He said to him, "She has wrought lewdness" (Jer. 11: 15). F. 'He said to him, "But wasn't it just a minority of them that did it?" G. 'He said to him, "It was a majority" (Jer. 11: 15). H. 'He said to him, "You should at least have taken account of the covenant of circumcision [which should have secured forgiveness despite their sin] ! " I. 'He said to him, "The holy flesh is passed from you" (Jer. 11: 15). J. "And if you had waited for them, they might have repented!" K. 'He said to him, "When you do evil, then you are happy" (Jer. 11: 15). L. 'He said to him, "He put his hands on his head, crying out and weaping, saying to them, God forbid! Perhaps they have no remedy at all!" M. 'A heavenly voice came forth and said, "The Lord called you 'a leafy olive tree, fair with excellent fruit'" (Jer. 11: 16). N. '"Just as in the case of an olive tree, its future comes only at the end [that is, it is only after a long while that it attains its best fruit], so in the case of Israel, their future comes at the end of their time. " ' b. Men. 53b One the one side, the tension established between God and Abraham gen? erates a compelling story. The issue is worked out with a beginning, middle, and end. There is surely a clear resolution at N. But the unfolding of the story, on God's part, is simply through statements God has already made - in Scripture. In fact, we have little more than a dramatization, to good effect, of Jeremiah 11: 15-16. No sage-story unfolds through the citations, in the months of sages, of verses of Scripture. The reason for the difference is not difficult to find. The author of this story (Isaac) has simply taken what God</page><page sequence="21">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 233 said to Jeremiah and recast the matter into statements God made to Abra? ham when the Temple was destroyed. Isaac has not given God language that, so far as Scripture is concerned, God did not say anyhow. Isaac has merely reframed God's statements in Scripture into a dramatic story. It follows that in the point at which a sage-story and a God-story differ, it is for a reason we can specify. But while the representation of God in God stories works itself out in a narrative model different from that of the sage story, the difference is still more profound. For, as we shall presently see, while God forms the model of the sage, God is not represented as merely another, more perfect sage. In the God-story as compared to the sage-story, God is truly wholly-other: alike but essentially unlike. We may go a step further and offer the hypothesis that, where we have a true story about God in incarnate form, it will ordinarily end with the climax of a verse of Scripture, being pointed toward that goal. A rather routine story shows us the central role played by the cited verse: A. Said R.Joshua b. Levi, 'When Moses came up on high, he found the Holy One, blessed be he, tying crowns onto the letters of the Torah. He said to him, "Moses, don't people say hello in your town?" B. 'He said to him, "Does a servant greet his master [first]?" C. 'He said to him, "You should have helped me [at least by greeting me and wishing me success]." D. 'He said to him, "Now I pray you let the power of the Lord be great, just as you have said" (Num. 14: 17.)' b. Shab. 89a The point of the story is made at C-D. God's message then derives from the cited verse of Scripture, which tells us how to greet the Master. Up to this point, we have found out a simple fact. When stories treat God as incarnate, they are unlike sage-stories at a critical point. Sage-stories do not reach their climax in the citation of verses of Scripture and do not serve to amplify the meaning or application of those stories. God-stories do. But does that definitive trait place God-stories into the classification of stories about scriptural figures and themes, as these appear in The Father According to Rabbi Nathan? We recall that three traits characterize Scripture-stories: [1] these lack beginning, middle, and end, and convey little movement; [2] they tend to form a tableau in stasis ; [3] the climax will come with verses of Scripture, exegesis of which forms the centre of interest. We shall now see that it is only at that third point at which stories about God and stories about scriptural heroes intersect. That leaves for reconsideration one profound and evocative story. It is a story that represents God as a critical actor, that unfolds from beginning to middle and end, that involves action, that sets up a point of tension and then resolves that tension, and that does not invoke a verse of Scripture or provide a proposition concerning the meaning of such a verse. In all its indicative traits, the following story treats the incarnation of God in accord with</page><page sequence="22">234 JACOB NEUSNER conventions characteristic of sage-stories in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan : A. Said R. Judah to Rab, 'When Moses went up to the height, he found the Holy One, blessed be he, sitting and tying crowns to the letters [of the Torah]. ' B. 'He said to him, "Lord of the universe, why is this necessary?' C. 'He said to him, "There is a certain man who is going to come into being at the end of some generations, by the name of Aqiba b. Joseph. He is going to find expositions to attach mounds and mounds of laws to each point [of a crown]." D. 'He said to him, "Lord of the universe, show him to me." E. 'He said to him, "Turn around." F. ' [Moses] went and took his seat at the end of eight rows, but he could not understand what the people were saying. He felt weak. When discourse came to a certain matter, one of [Aqiba's] disciples said to him, "My lord, how do you know this?" G. 'He said to him, "It is a law revealed by God to Moses at Mount Sinai." H. 'Moses' spirits were restored. I. 'He turned back and returned to the Holy One, blessed be he. He said to him, "Lord of the universe, now if you have such a man available, how can you give the Torah through me?" J. 'He said to him, "Be silent. That is how I have decided matters." K. 'He said to him, "Lord of the universe, you have now shown me his mastery of the Torah. Now show me his reward." L. 'He said to him, "Turn around." M. 'He turned around and saw people weighing out his flesh in the butcher shop. N. 'He said to him, "Lord of the universe, such is his mastery of Torah, and such is his reward?" O. 'He said to him, "Be silent. That is how I have decided matters."' B. Men. 29b This story in every detail but one conforms to the indicative traits of the sage story. Verses of Scripture play no role. God is the protagonist of the story; Moses the straight man. The story unfolds with a marked beginning, the tension by Moses' question about the details of the letters in which the Torah is written. The middle is worked out at D-H. There is then a second point of tension - Moses cannot understand the message - and then comes a resolution. Everything Aqiba says begins with Moses. But that produces the third and most intense point of tension, leading to the story's real point, which unfolds at I-O. So we move in stages, conflict, resolution, then to a higher level of conflict. But at one stunning point the story that expresses the incarnation of God takes its leave of the sage-story. What we lack is the resolution of the final point of conflict ; it is open-ended : Be silent, That is how I have decided matters. That statement hardly marks a happy ending, and it assuredly does not answer the question with which the passage commences. The story merely restates the question in a more profound way. So the one truly striking story about God in the form of not a human being in general but a sage in</page><page sequence="23">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 235 particular, a sage engaged in debate and argument, turns out to make precisely the opposite of the point of every other sage-story. All other such stories tell us how sages resolve points of tension and sort out conflict, bringing to a happy resolution whatever problem has generated the action of the story. But this story tells us the precise opposite, which is that God decrees and even the sage - even our rabbi, Moses, the sage of all sages - must maintain humble silence and accept the divine decree. Turning matters around in a secular direction, we may state the proposition in this way : the sage is like God, but, like all other human beings, subject to God's ultimately autocephalic decree. A story built on the premise of the incarnation of God, fully exposing God's traits of personality and portraying God like a sage, engaged in argument with a man as master engages in argument with a disciple, serves a stunning purpose, which contradicts its academic form. It is to show that God, while like a sage, is more than a sage - much more. And, even in this deeply human context, that 'more' is to be stated only in the submission expressed through silence. This I take to be the final statement of the incarnation of God of the Judaism of the dual Torah. God incarnate remains God ineffable. When the Judaism of the dual Torah wishes to portray the character of divinity, it invokes in the end the matter of relationship and not tactile quality and character. If we wish to know God, it is through our relationship to God, not through our (entirely legitimate and welcome) act of the incarnation of God in heart and mind and soul, deliberation and deed. And the way to engage with, relate to, God, in the face of (in the suggestive instance at hand) the Torah and torture of Aqiba, is silence. In an age struck dumb by horror and Holocaust, in anguish seeking God's face in a time of the hiding of the face, incarnation takes its unanticipated forms, just as at the Sea, just as at Sinai. In response to God's self-revelation, whether at the Sea, whether-at Sinai, whether in sickness or in health, whether in moments of despair and disappointment or in an hour of exultation and ecstasy, what is to be said? 'He said to him, "Be silent. That is how I have decided matters.'" 'And Abram put his faith in the Lord, and the Lord counted that faith in him as righteousness. ' V. WHY IN IRANIAN BABYLONIA IN PARTICULAR? It remains briefly to answer the second question raised at the outset. The process of the incarnation of God culminate in the Talmud Bavli, redacted in Babylonia, a western satrapy of Sasanian Iran, in c. a.D. 600. Since in earlier writings, produced in the Land of Israel ('Palestine') under Rom? an-Christian rule in the fifth century a.D., that process clearly had brought forth concrete statements that God 'in our image and likeness' is to be</page><page sequence="24">236 JACOB NEUSNER portrayed in incarnate form, we must wonder why only in the Bavli did the process yield explicit statements, such as we have seen. The authorship of Genesis Rabbah for example has presented a powerful story about the angels' not knowing the difference between God and the first man, since they looked exactly alike. That is why we wonder why it was in the Bavli, written in Iran, not in the Yerushalmi and its associated writings, produced in Rome, that the stories before us came to redaction. Once we frame the question in that simple way, the obvious difference between Roman-Byzantine-Christian Palestine, that is, the Land of Israel, and Iranian-Zoroastrian Babylonia, come to the fore. The Land of Israel also was Roman-Christian Palestine. Babylonia was part of the Iranian empire under Sasanian rule. Christianity posed a considerable challenge to Judaism on the Roman side of the inter? national frontier, but constituted itself a minority cult on the other.1 With the Christians pointing to Jesus Christ as God incarnate, the con? ception of the incarnation of God for sages became both plausible and also problematical.2 Scripture had long provided ample occasions for offering to Judaic system-builders a character of divinity that encompassed accessible, human traits. Genesis Rabbah (c. a.D. 400-450) and Pesiqta deRab Kahana (c. a.D. 450-500) give us sufficient reason to affirm that fact for the Judaism of the dual Torah. But the crisis of the age threatened the foundations of Judaism as it them flourished. Christian theologians maintained that the political triumph of Christ's Church, now in charge of the Roman Empire, had validated the representation of Jesus as Christ and also as the union of humanity and divinity. Christian iconography left little to the imagination in the representation of Christ as union of God and man. Christian theo? logians carefully explained in detail how the union realized in (that one) man the traits of God. For the Judaic sages political conditions in the Land of Israel, which is to say, in Roman and Christian Palestine, rendered acute and dangerous the formerly chronic dispute with Christianity. With the conception of the incarnation of God a considerable component of the Christian position, sages in the documents of the Land of Israel clearly treated with reticence, and mainly through allusion, the perfectly available conception of God as incarnate. While the politics of Christian Rome posed an obstacle to the realization of the incarnation of God in stories and allusions, on the Iranian and Zoroastrian side, there was no counterpart consideration. The Judaic writings redacted in Sasanian Iran contain slight evidence that the challenge of Christian required a response. The pressing issues of 1 I have presented the main facts of the matter in my summary of earlier findings, reprinted as Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism in Talmudic Babylonia (Lanham, 1986: University Press of America Studies in Judaism series). 2 The reason that Christianity in the fourth century, but not earlier, struck sages as a serious challenge is spelled out in my Judaism and Christianity in the Age ofConstantine (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, I987)</page><page sequence="25">THE GOD OF JUDAISM 237 inter-religious dispute came from the state religion, the worship of Mazda, and from the sages in the line of Zoroaster. Whatever the substance of these issues, the character of divinity as incarnate did not frame one of them. I know of no statement, deriving from the fifth, sixth, or seventh centuries, of a Zoroastrian critique ofJudaism. The one systematic Zoroastrian apologia in hand, Shkand Gumanik Vicar, comes to us from the ninth century.1 At issue in that statement are rather philosophical arguments, e.g. concerning whether God's essence was light or darkness, against the notion of creatio e nihilo, and - pertinent to our problem - against the corporeality of God. The author of the Shkand ridicules the notion that the Lord grew tired in making the world. Why was he tired? Why, then, did God make Adam and Eve and give them commands that they could not naturally carry out? God is shown to be confused, unreasonable, malicious, in favour of ignorance and against knowledge. God is furthermore represented by Judaism as vengeful, angry, harsh, possessed of unpleasant physical qualities, warlike, cruel, capricious, mean. The sheer anthropomorphism and incarnationalism of Judaism is ridiculed. We do not know that Mazdean critics ofJudaism in the centuries in which the Bavli took shape addressed to Judaism a similar critique of its corporeal conception of God, and we also cannot necessarily assign to Mazdean thinkers of the period in which the Bavli was forming that powerful rationalism that characterized the ninth-century apologetic (against Islam, as a matter of fact). All we can do is propose that if out of Zoroastrian theology in the later Sasanian period emerged no powerful tendency to accomplish the incarnation of God, sages will have found no motive to avoid saying what they wished. And if the later critique echoed earlier arguments (as many scholars suppose), then sages will have had every reason to affirm precisely what their critics in the Mazdean world will have condemned. The incarnation of God in stories concerning God's wisdom and love will then have faced the challenge - not a crisis at all - head-on: God indeed takes human form, but it is in love and wisdom, not in hatred and stupidity, as the other side maintains. The polemical charge in the incarnation of God on the part ofJudaic sages then contains both a negative and a positive: the positive is to affirm what the other side condemned, the negative to deny the traits alleged by the other side and to impute instead the ones all sides could affirm.2 Why, then, Babylonia, and not the Land of Israel? Because there ' I have reprinted my translation, from the Pazend, of the pertinent chapters of the Shkand in Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism, pp. 175-I98. 2 But in so stating, I seem to have wandered back from the sixth and seventh centuries in Iranian Babylonia to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Europe and America, where the same exchange repeated itself. With Christians affirming God's incarnation, Jews denied that incarnation found a place in the Judaic portrait of the character of divinity. They moreover claimed that such a conception of God was incompatible with the heritage of the Hebrew Scriptures, and that all representations of God as a human being in those Scriptures were 'merely figurative' or otherwise spiritual, whatever these things 10 RES 24</page><page sequence="26">238 JACOB NEUSNER was no reason not to, and every reason to, represent as incarnate the character of divinity. Brown University Rhode Island U.S.A. can have meant. With Christians condemning the Jews' God as vindictive and (merely) just, Judaic apologists (both Jewish and Christian) restated the obvious fact that the character of divinity in Judaism, like that in Christianity, portrayed God as loving and compassionate. The requirements of inter-religious dialogue therefore appear to play a more considerable role in the inner logic of religious reflection than may have been fully appreciated.</page></plain_text>
