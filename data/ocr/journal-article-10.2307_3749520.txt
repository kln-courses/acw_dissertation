<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY THE JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTE OF PHILOSOPHY VOL. XLV No. 171. JANUARY 1970 ON THE COHERENCE OF CHRISTIAN ATHEISMI COLIN LYAS I BEGIN with some remarks on Christian Atheism and the Death of God Theology. These are not, as might be thought, identical movements. Rather, as I shall try to make clear, Christian Atheism is one form that the Death of God theology has assumed. The Death of God movement originated in the work of a small group of American theologians. This group is not to be thought of as a unified group, working to a commonly agreed programme. Rather it embraces a number of thinkers who offer different, and sometimes contradictory, answers to certain common problems, e.g., the problem of how to make the Christian message relevant in the mid-Twentieth Century. Among the leading figures of the Death of God movement are the following: Gabrial Vahanian, whose book The Death of God gave the movement its name, Harvey Cox, author of The Secular City, Thomas Altizer, whose most representative work is The Gospel of Christian Atheism, William Hamilton, author of The New Essence of Christianity and Paul van Buren who wrote The Secular Meaning of the Gospel. 2 The religious affiliations of these writers vary somewhat. Vahanian is by upbringing a French Calvinist. Cox and Hamilton are Baptists. Altizer is an Episcopalian layman and van Buren is an Episcopalian priest. If we add to these, as Altizer tells us we should, 3 the Jewish theo- logian Dr. Richard Rubenstein, it will be seen that the movement is reasoeably ecumenical. These, then, are the fathers of the Death of God theology. Of them, I shall argue, it is Altizer who raises the most fundamental problems for the philosophy of religion. Before dealing specifically with him, however, I want to make a number of general points about the Death of God movement, and I begin with an attempt to classify the writers involved in it. 4 The statement "God is Dead" can be taken either literally or non- literally. I look first at the non-literal formulations. If we take this statement non-literally, we must either put quotation marks round the word "God", in order to indicate that it does not have I</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY its normal denotation, or we must put the word "dead" in quotation marks in order to indicate that this word does not have its normal mean- ing. It is more usual to put the quotation marks round the word "dead". A theologian making the assertion "God is'dead"' does not want to be taken literally. He is not saying the God is dead, as for example Napoleon is. He is saying such things as, "people don't seem to find the idea of God necessary any more" or even "there never was a God". If we do take the statement "God is dead" in this non-literal way, then it is but a paradoxical way of saying something that could be said quite straightforwardly, as, for example, the statement "parallel lines meet at infinity" is just a paradoxical way of saying that such lines never meet at all. We can next distinguish two main ways in which we may take the non-literal assertion of the death of God. There is first what I call "the theistic non-literal assertion"of this statement. Here the asserter wishes to claim that there is still a transcendent being, but that for some reason he is not at present a lively force in the world. There is, secondly, an atheistic non-literal assertion "God is dead". The atheist does not mean by this assertion that God once existed and now does so no longer. Rather he is saying in a striking and polemical way that there never was a God. We can, therefore, give a non-literal reading to the statement "God is dead". It is obvious that such non-literal readings remove much of the air or paradox that has surrounded the Death of God Theology. These non-literal versions of the Death of God Theology are either new examples of historically common complaints about the increase in unbelief or new ways of putting the atheistic position. Although by and large Death of God theologians mean the statement "God is dead" to be taken non-literally, it is, of course, possible that the statement "God is dead" is meant literally. It then amounts to the assertion that there was once a being rightly called God, and that this being in fact died. This is the much more interesting interpretation. Using the distinctions I have drawn, how are the main figures of the Death of God movement to be classified? Vahanian, Cox, Hamilton and van Buren are, I think, non-literalists. Of these Vahanian and Cox are theistic non-literalists. They would maintain that there is still some- thing transcendent. Their problem is that this transcendent being is described using an out-moded terminology, and hence that many people are cut off from knowledge of it. Hamilton and van Buren on the other hand, are atheistic non-literalists. Thus, in 1965, Hamilton finally came to accept that there is no God "out there". Van Buren also came to this conclusion, but by a somewhat different route. For him, the word "God" has no meaning. "The problem", he writes, "is that the word God is dead". 5 2</page><page sequence="3">ON THE COHERENCE OF CHRISTIAN ATHEISM Altizer, however, is a much more interesting case. He is, as far as I know, the only literalist. He writes: "It is essential that the radical Christian make clear what he means by his confession, eliminating so far as possible all that confusion and ambiguity arising from the language of the Death of God. To confess the death of God is to speak of an actual and real event; not perhaps an event occurring in a moment of time or history, but, notwithstanding this reservation, an event that has actually happened both in a cosmic and in an historical sense. There should be no confusion deriving from the mistaken assumption that such a confession refers to an eclipse of God or a withdrawal of God from history or the creation. Rather, an authentic language speaking of the death of God must inevitably be speaking of the death of God himself. The radical Christian pro- claims that God has actually died in Christ, that this death is both an historical and a cosmic event, and as such it is a final and irrevocable event which cannot be reversed." 6 I shall show later that this literalism makes Altizer philosophically very interesting. From the foregoing it will be clear that only van Buren, Hamilton and Altizer are atheists. What is interesting, and I shall take this up next, is that they call themselves Christian atheists. II Although all the death of God theologians differ, indeed often markedly, yet certain common problems have stimulated their work. All are in some way dissatisfied with both the quality of human life at the present time and with the quality of the religious message. All are seeking ways in which to make this message relevant to our present problems. Not only are they thus united in seeking answers to various problems about the human condition, but they are united also in the belief that any satis- factory answer to these problems must be an answer that will make life tolerable in this world, here and now and which will direct attention to the social and other problems of this life. In the answers that are given to these problems a division appears between the theistic and the atheistic versions of the death of God theology Vahanian and Cox offer answers in which an appeal to the figure of Christ is not a strongly marked and necessary feature. Altizer, van Buren and Hamilton are, however, remarkable for being Christian Atheists. An appeal to the figure of Christ is a marked, indeed necessary feature of their work. They claim that although no appeal to a transcendent being will answer our problems, yet an answer is to be found by reference to the figure of Jesus Christ who, after all, himself lived in the world and had to come to terms with it. This concentration on Christ varies. In Altizer the Christ in question is not the historical Christ, although He is the incarnate God. In van 3</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY Buren's work, the Christ upon which interest is focussed is not the in- carnate God but is the historical Jesus. Van Buren's theology rests on facts about the historical Jesus, and in particular upon the events in Jeru- salem and its environs at the time of the first Easter. Although van Buren can make no sense of the notion of a transcendent Being, yet, he claims, the gospel stories still have a message for us, a secular message. To get to this message we must translate the Gospels, traditionally taken to be accounts of the actions of an incarnate form of God, into human terms. Van Buren says: "I am trying to argue that Christianity is fundamentally about man, i.e., that its language about God is one way, a dated way, of saying what it is Christianity wants to say about man and human life and human history." 7 Jesus, on this translation, is the perfect man in that he exemplifies the qualities of personality which will make us most spiritually satisfied and best fit us for the life we have now to live. Jesus is taken to be the model of full manhood, and the fact that Jesus actually lived shows that this model is not an unattainable ideal. In Altizer, van Buren and Hamilton, therefore, the figure of Jesus is venerated although the notion of an existent transcendent being is dis- pensable. In this, as Altizer points out, the Christian atheism of the Twentieth century is linked to the Nineteenth century atheism of Nietzsche and, possibly, Blake. III I come now to my consideration of Altizer. Altizer, like the other Death of God theologians, begins with the aim of offering us a new gospel by which to live, a new message intended to redeem us from the rootless- ness, insignificance and spiritual misery that Altizer reckons to be our lot. Altizer proclaims the "good tidings" of the death of God as "a redemptive event". Before I come to my examination of the coherence of Altizer's assertion "God is dead", I need to make a number of expository and critical points about his work First, Altizer relies heavily upon a vast number of sources and in par- ticular on the writings of Blake and Hegel. He is, for example, com- mitted to the truth of Hegel's dialectical philosophy. Unfortunately, as at least one commentator points out it is not obvious either that Altizer has understood Hegel properly.8 Nor is it obvious that if Altizer had got Hegel right, the parts of Hegel which are important to him make much sense anyway. Since the appeal to Blake has a purely imaginative force, it is not clear that the intellectual underpinnings of Altizer's philo- sophy are sound. 9 Secondly the language of Altizer's work is often very obscure. A not untypical passage would be the following: 4</page><page sequence="5">ON THE COHERENCE OF CHRISTIAN ATHEISM "He (Christ) actually and truly becomes manifest in history, and finally history itself becomes not simply the area of revelation but the incarnate body of Christ." 1O A book replete with such remarks poses a great problem to the ordinary understanding and makes the task of relevant comment very difficult. Thirdly, apart from the obscurity of the language, there is another reason why it is difficult to mount any attack on Altizer's position. At one place in The Gospel of Christian Atheism, 1I Altizer appears to reject both the law of identity and the law of contradiction, and, incidentally, fathers this on Hegel. If Altizer does indeed reject these basic laws of logic, then even a discovery of a contradiction in his work will avail us little. It is not clear, therefore, exactly what Altizer's position is, nor what one could say to him that would lead him to see the falsity of his position. I shall, however, try to give an outline of the main features of the Gospel of Christian Atheism according to Altizer, since my later remarks depend on our having at least some understanding of what Altizer is up to. Having given this account I shall go then on to make some preliminary criticisms of it. IV Here is one statement by Altizer: "In saying that God is dead we are attempting to say that the trans- cendent God, the ultimate and final ground of the world, life and exist- ence has died. He has died in such a way as to embody himself re- demptively in Christ. He has died to make possible the final recon- ciliation of himself with the world." 12 How is this reconciliation effected? It is achieved when God, the sovereign and transcendent Lord, source and ground of all being, takes on form of a servant, becomes a man, and dies. In becoming a man He the enters, says Altizer, into this spatio-temporal world. By this means all that power formerly vested in a Being set apart from the world is released into the world that God "enters" through Christ. The realm of the transcendent then becomes empty and God is dead. This move from transcendent God to human figure shifts the centre of our interest from the transcendent and other worldly, to the fullness of life in the flesh, in space and time, in the life, energy and movement of the present world. In what way, however, is the death of God a redemptive event? Altizer's claim is that formerly we lived in fear of some transcendent being who, by His very nature, demands all our attention. With the death of this being we are freed from the inhibitions that such a figure imposes upon us and which prevent us from developing our human potential to the full. Released from the need to centre our lives on this being, we are free to turn to the task of developing this human potential. We can turn to this world 5</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY and are freed for a full, rich, uninhibited and energetic life in it. Thus Altizer writes of the man who knows of the Death of God: "He can rejoice because he knows that he is liberated from any trans- cendent ground, from any kind of awesome mystery, from any kind of ultimate norm, from any kind of beyond, and is herein released for a fullness-a totality of life and energy, here and now, in the world. We can participate fully and joyously in the world, in the time and flesh before us." 13 God, and here the appeal is to Blake, is to be identified with everything repressive and fills us with dread and guilt. 14 Altizer, I think, feels that any transcendent being must have this repressive effect on us. Once such a being is removed from the scene, we are liberated. God of course, sees this and, as the supreme act of love, in order to effect the final reconciliation that will liberate us, he chooses to annihilate himself. V Before discussing the more fundamental issues that are raised by the work of Altizer, and in particularly by his literally intended assertion that God is dead, I wish to make a number of less radical preliminary comments. First, it is worth pointing out that Altizer is at some initial advantage vis-a-vis such humanistic Christian atheists as van Buren. Van Buren's Christ is just a man, albeit an extraordinary one and it is hard to explain why this man should have such an over-riding claim on us. Altizer's Christ, however, was truly the incarnate God, and so naturally has a claim for our especial attention. Nonetheless Altizer is in a very exposed position. Since he needs the notion of a transcendent being "outside" space and time and with all the qualities usually assigned to God, he will come under attack from those philosophers and theologians who have found it difficult to make sense of statements about such a being. Thus a large part of his account would be rejected as meaningless by, e.g., a theologian such as van Buren. And since, having got this being, Altizer then tries to dispense with Him, he will be under attack from theologians of a more conservative stamp. Secondly, according to Altizer. when God died he made possible a new life for us. His death in some way rescued us from a meaningless exist- ence. The great interest in the death of God theology is evidence that many people feel, however inarticulately, the need for some message that will give some sort of meaning to their lives. If Altizer is right about the redemptive nature of the death of God, then the tidings of the death of God will indeed be "good news". Suppose we ask, however, what this new life will be, what we are told to do by the new message. We shall find that Altizer, like many of the death of God theologians, is disappointingly vague. All we are told of the life made new is that it is a life in which we live fully in the flesh, in the world, with liberty, energy, life and joy: 6</page><page sequence="7">ON THE COHERENCE OF CHRISTIAN ATHEISM "(We are) released for a .... totality of life and energy here and now, in the world. We can participate fully and joyously in the world, in the time and flesh before us." 1 5 The claim that we are released by the death of God for a life of fullness and energy in the flesh is not however, very helpful as a guide to conduct. We might ask, for example, whether it is not the case that many activities that some people might claim express "joyous life and energy in the flesh" are morally wrong, e.g., to take an extreme case, eating people. How are these activities ruled out on Altizer's account? This raises the general difficulty about the sheer imprecision of Altizer's message. How do we know just what we are supposed to do, just how we are supposed to comport ourselves in the light of the message of the death of God? Altizer, in a debate with William Montgomery, was asked just this question. His reply was: "It is a question that each man is called to answer for himself. Each man has to ask himself wherein he feels a release of energy, wherein he finds love and joy .... For me, I believe, we can look to the world, the flesh, the body, energy, as being most fundamentally the source of life for us."16 This, however, is not what is wanted, nor is it what we thought we were getting. If we ask what the full life is for man, we are likely to feel cheated if we are told "Do what you like", especially if no justification is given for this answer. It may, of course, be the right answer, the question is "What has Altizer done to show that it is ?". My third comment on Altizer's Gospel is this. Altizer claims that God, as a matter of fact, irreversibly died in Christ. This actually happened. The question we need to ask here is how Altizer knows that this event really took place. If people are to be asked to believe what Altizer says, and, as some would say, put their immortal souls at risk, they are entitled to ask for a proof that Altizer's story is true. What is Altizer's reply to this demand? Roughly speaking, he says that his story should be believed because, if we do believe it, we can fit everything happening about us into a coherent pattern. The story is a good interpretation of our present condition. Thus when, in the dialogue with Montgomery referred to above, he is asked why his claims should be believed his answer is: "(People) have an obligation to listen to anything that will bring mean- ing to life." ' 7 The answer to this is that if the only claim that one is making is to have given an account that imposes a possible interpretation on experience, one has, as yet, no right to claim that this account is true. If the events referred to in the account really happened, then the account is true. The question is, "Did they happen?". Altizer in fact dodges the important issues. If his claim is only to have given an account that gives meaning to life, not only must he give 7</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY up the claim to have given a true account, but he must also tell us what to do when someone else, say a Marxist, offers a rival interpretation and claims that it gives as good, if not a better, interpretation of experience. What does Altizer say about this? "I do not want to claim that my way is the only way . . . But I think it is a possibility because it attempts to understand Christ as being present in the world." 18 So, granted that Altizer's account is a possible account (and I shall shortly be asking whether it is) we want to know, first, how Altizer can know that his account is a true one. Secondly, if his account is an inter- pretation we want to know what to do about other alternative accounts. IV Altizer's account is based on the possibility of the literal truth of the assertion "God is dead". If this statement could not be literally true, then Altizer's account collapses. It is to the question of the coherence of this statement that I now turn. A proof that this statement is incoherent would have two important implications. First, the verification issue that I mentioned in my third criticism of Altizer is settled. If Altizer's claim that God died could not possibly be literally true, then we need not bother to enquire whether it is in fact true. The second implication of a proof that the statement "God is dead" is incoherent is more fundamental to the Death of God theology. The movement will lose much of its force. For if the notion of God dying is logically incoherent then the proclamation of the death of God will have to be construed in some non-literal way if it is to make sense. And, as I have said, if the statement "God is dead" is construed in some non-literal way it is either an historically common expression of the diffi- culty of making the Christian message relevant, or it is the expression of an atheistic or agnostic position. We can find our feet with such issues. It is because Altizer means what he says to be taken literally that he is the really interesting and disturbing death of God theologian. VII Most people when they hear the expression "God is dead" feel some sort of intellectual affront. The assertion strikes them as some sort of con- tradictory gibberish. It is, however, by no means easy, if it is possible at all, to show that this reaction is correct. To begin with, I want to try and show what common and traditional beliefs about God account for the feeling that there is some sort of inco- herence in the statement that God is dead. The feeling is, I take it, that anyone who understands the meaning of the word "God" understands by this term something all powerful, incorruptible, something which could never die or cease to be. Given "God" is understood in this way the assertion of the death of God is likely to seem strange. 19 But then, 8</page><page sequence="9">ON THE COHERENCE OF CHRISTIAN ATHEISM we might ask, is not Altizer claiming that God annihilated himself, and if he is to be called omnipotent, why should he not be able to perform this feat? After all, a proof that I could not commit suicide, would be a proof that there is something I cannot do and hence a proof that I am not all powerful. We should not be led astray here into asking why God should want to annihilate himself. If he did so, he would of course have a good reason. The interesting question is could he do this. If he could then the state- ment "God is dead" is not logically incoherent and Altizer's account might well be true, although there will perhaps be insuperable difficulties in showing that it is true. If, therefore, we consider the possibility of self annihilation, we are bound to ask why God could annihilate himself, and, if God could not, whether this places limits on his power. In consequence, anyone who thinks that the statement "God is dead" is gibberish is obliged to do more than assert it is so. He must show that it is nonsense to imagine an admittedly all powerful being bringing about his own demise. Let us ask then if God could bring about his own annihilation and if an inability to do so reflects upon his omnipotence. I shall try to make clear that there is a strong case that can be made for saying that the inability of God to annihilate himself does not reflect upon his omnipotence. The belief in the logical impossibility of the death of God is based on other beliefs, in particular the belief that God is a necessary being. Also involved are certain assumptions about omnipotence. The beliefs that lead to the rejection of the possibility of God's self annihilation are, I shall claim, beliefs that would be, and indeed have been, accepted by many religious people. Indeed did the beliefs I have in mind not express what many people believe about God, then few, if any, would have found the assertion "God is dead" intellectually offensive. A corollary of this is that if we wish to argue that the statement "God is dead" is not incoherent, then we must attack these beliefs. The two main beliefs I am concerned with are a belief about the omnipotence of God and a belief about God's existence as a necessary being. I begin with some comments on God's omnipotence. VIII When we say that X is omnipotent an important qualification must be implicit in our assertion. If we made this qualification explicit we would say that an omnipotent being can do anything logically possible, anything that can be meaningfully asked of him. If I claim to be omnipotent you can challenge my claim by asking me to jump thirty feet into the air, and my failure to do so shows that I am not omnipotent. On the other hand, if you ask me to produce a four-sided triangle, my inability to do this does not reflect upon my omnipotence. I can point out that what you are asking me to do is contradictory, doesn't make sense. And since what 9</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY you are asking me to do doesn't make sense, I can claim that you have not, as yet, asked me to do anything. An omnipotent being is required to do only what it is logically possible for him to do. He cannot meaning- fully be asked to do the logically impossible. There have been debates in the history of theology upon this matter. Descartes, for example, thought that God, in order to be an omnipotent being, would have to be able to do the logically impossible as well as the logically possible.20 Leonard Miller has argued, rightly I think, that Descartes made this claim because he did not understand the nature of necessary truths, but this is a point I do not now wish to explore.21 Anselm and Aquinas took a different line. In the following passage, for example, Anselm excepts certain contradictory things from the notion of God's power: "You cannot be corrupted, You cannot lie, You cannot make that which is true to be false, you cannot make that which has been done not to have been done, and so forth."122 Aquinas is more explicit: "Therefore everything that does not imply a contradiction in terms is numbered amongst these possible things, in respect of which God is called omnipotent, whereas whatever implies a contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. It is better to say that these things cannot be done than to say God cannot do them."23 The first point therefore, is that God cannot be asked to do the logically impossible and that an inability to do the logically impossible is irrelevant to questions about omnipotence. If this first claim is right, we have only to show that the notion of God's self-annihilation is a self-contradictory one. It will not then make sense to say God has annihilated himself, nor will it make sense to ask Him to do so. In consequence the fact that He cannot do this will not show that God is not omnipotent. Ix A closer look at the proposition "God has annihilated Himself" is now required. This entails the proposition, "God could exist at one time and at a later time might no longer exist", which is to say "an existent God could cease to exist". If we want to say that "God could annihilate Himself" is absurd, it is, I think, sufficient to show that the statement "An existent God could cease to exist" is absurd. For if we ask X to annihilate himself we are asking that he should exist at one time and then bring it about that he does not exist at a later time. If this is not possible in the case of God then it does not make sense to ask that God be able to annihilate himself. The belief that the statement "An existent God could cease to exist" is absurd rests on a fundamental belief of our religious tradition, viz. the belief that God is a necessary being. To show why people think that the 10</page><page sequence="11">ON THE COHERENCE OF CHRISTIAN ATHEISM claim "an existent God could cease to exist" is absurd is to show what these people mean by saying "God is a necessary being" or "God is a self-sufficient being", for what they have meant, among other things, is that once we allow that God exists, it does not make sense to suppose that he could cease to exist. Thinkers from Anselm to Norman Malcolm have laid stress on the claim that anything rightly to be called "God" would have to be a necessary being. For Anselm, as for Malcolm, this is implied by the belief that "God" means "being than which a greater cannot be conceived". We must, I think, admit that Anselm is right in his claim that "God" means "being than which a greater cannot be conceived". What I wish to discuss in the rest of this paper is whether a being than which a greater cannot be conceived must be a necessary being. I shall first try to explain the position of those who would maintain that the greatest possible being is a necessary being.24 Professor Findlay points out25 that the appropriate object for a reli- gious attitude must be the greatest conceivable being, something filling us with wonder and awe and before whom we are as nothing. What we mean when we call this being "the greatest possible being" is, inter alia, that such a being must not be limited in any way. For if it were limited, we could conceive of a greater being, one that is not limited in any way. This we cannot do, since, by hypothesis, the object of our religious attitude is the greatest possible being. The greatest possible being cannot be a limited being. Findlay then goes on to point out that when we contem- plate this unlimited object of our religious devotion: "We are led irresistibly to a yet more stringent demand. We can't help thinking that the worthy object of our worship can never be a thing that merely happens to exist. Not only must the existence of other things be unthinkable without Him, but his own non-existence must be unthinkable in any circumstances. God must be wholly inescapable." 26 There might seem to be something right about this. If we thought that the object of our religious attitude could cease to exist, then it would not be the greatest of all beings. Another could be imagined that could not cease to exist. But we have already assumed that the object of our reli- gious attitude is the greatest possible being, so it could not cease to exist. I should add here that if Findlay is correct in his claim that the appropriate object of the religious attitude could not merely happen to exist, then God could not annihilate himself. If he could annihilate himself, then it would be merely a matter of contingent fact that he did not do so and hence his existence would be a matter of fact, he would just happen to exist. Norman Malcolm writes: "If God is conceived to be an absolutely unlimited being, He must be conceived as unlimited in regard to His existence as well as His operation. 11</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY It will not make sense to say he depends on anything for coming into or continuing in existence. . . . It would be contrary to the conception of God as an unlimited being to suppose that anything other than God himslf could prevent him from existing, and it would be self-contra- dictory to suppose that he himself could do it." 7 Anselm first made this point when he wrote: "And it so truly exists that it cannot be conceived not to exist. For it is possible to conceive of a being which cannot be conceived not to exist and this is greater than one which can be conceived not to exist. .... So truly, therefore, is there something than which nothing greater can be conceived, that it cannot be conceived not to exist. And this being thou art, 0 Lord, our God."28 The following passage by Malcolm sums up the notion of a necessary being: "If God, a being a greater than which cannot be conceived, does not exist then He cannot come into existence. For if He did He would either have been caused to come into existence or have happened to come into existence, and in either case He would be a limited being, which by our conception of Him He is not. . . . If He does exist He cannot have come into existence (for the reasons given), nor can He cease to exist, for nothing could cause Him to cease to exist, nor could it just happen that He ceased to exist. So if God exists, His existence is necessary."29 It is claimed, therefore, that "God" means "being than which a greater cannot be conceived" and this is thought to entail in its turn that if God exists he necessarily exists.30 Moreover, to say that God necessarily exists is to say that once we concede that God does exist, it does not make sense to suppose that he could cease to exist. To say that an existent God could cease to exist would be to contradict oneself, and to ask him to annihilate himself would be to ask him to do the logically impossible, namely to bring it about that an existent God should cease to exist. Since what is being asked in this case is self-contradictory, the fact that God cannot annihilate himself does not show that God is not omnipotent. It is clear that if "God" means "necessary being", we rule out as logic- ally incoherent the assertion "God existed at one time and did not exist at a later time". Since this is just what Altizer is committed to, his account is ruled out as incoherent. Moreover, it will now be of no use trying to render the assertion "God is dead" in any literal way. The death of God theology must therefore either be taken as an outcry against the loss of relevance, or a confession of atheism. X I want now to make some remarks about the position I have outlined, the position according to which the statement "God is dead" is logically 12</page><page sequence="13">ON THE COHERENCE OF CHRISTIAN ATHEISM incoherent. I shall consider one or two preliminary difficulties to begin with, then I shall go on to difficulties of a far more fundamental nature. First, if it is right that "God" means "necessary being", then although Altizer must give up a claim to be making a literal statement when he proclaims the death of God, he can of course fall back on to a non-literal statement. He could say, and sometimes comes close to saying, that the death of God was no mere death but merely a transformation. 31 Such a move will naturally raise traditional difficulties about the ability of an incorruptible and immutable being to transform himself. Secondly, Altizer seems to me to have one important insight when he talks of the death of God as an irreversible event. Once we concede that God does not exist any more, then since by definition a necessary being could not begin to exist, God's death is final. Altizer's work, here, indi- cates that there are interesting paradoxes for Christian theologians who wish to assert that "God" means "necessary being". If God did become incarnate so that Jesus Christ was indeed God, then what are we to make of the events of Easter? If Jesus was God he could not, by definition have died on the cross, for He would have been a necessary being and necessary beings cannot cease to exist. Suppose, though, for the sake of argument Jesus, as God incarnate, did die upon the cross. Then, by definition, he could not as God arise again. For once God, a necessary being, is said not to exist, it is impossible to assert that he will begin to exist. The Easter story, therefore, is impossible. An incarnate God could not die on the cross, and if, per impossible, he did, he could not have risen again. The sequence of events beginning at the incarnation and terminating with the crucifixion, is somehow contradictory. 3 2 This deals rational theology a crippling blow. Various lines of defence may be open here. The task of producing a rational theology may be given up, that is, it may be claimed that there is no contradiction here, but that the resolution of the apparent paradox is hidden from our mortal eyes. Again, the traditional reading of the Easter story may be given up. It can be treated, as van Buren treats it, as an outmoded way of saying something that is not paradoxical. This is likely to be an unpopular move even though it avoids the contradiction. For at the very root of traditional Christian belief lies the claim that if Christ did not rise from the dead "we are of all men the most miserable". Yet again one may announce, as Pope Paul has done, that the church must not mind being called "a church of contradictions". Only then, logical difficulties about the implications of contradictions apart,33 such theologians must give up criticizing Altizer for his contradictions until they can say why their contradictions are to be preferred. Xi The second remark I wish to make about the position I have outlined in Sections VIII and IX is more fundamental. The position I outlined there 13</page><page sequence="14">PHILOSOPHY according to which there is a contradiction in the statement "God is dead" depends upon the truth of the claims (i) that "God" means "being than which no greater can be conceived" and (ii) that the greatest conceivable being is a necessary being. If the position is weak it is because either or both of these claims cannot be sustained. Two main lines of attack on this position therefore suggest themselves. One is to reject the claim that "God" means "being than which a greater cannot be conceived". This I take it would be unsatisfactory. The other possibility is to admit that "God" means "being than which no greater can be conceived" and then go on and deny that the greatest possible being is one that necessarily exists. We must say, if we take this latter line, that the greatest possible being, the most adequate object for the religious attitude, might be one which does not involve the idea of necessary existence. Let me indicate two directions in which this attack may be developed. First, someone might say that a satisfactory object for the religious attitude might be a being who, though not dependent on anything else for its existence, and although having no beginning to its existence, might nonetheless be able to bring about its own non-existence, it being merely a matter of fact that he does not choose to do so. Such a being might strike someone as having one more possibility open to him and hence a more fitting object of worship. There is an important reason why this approach is not likely to be thought satisfactory, a reason suggested by the popularity of the cosmo- logical arguments. Suppose we grant that cosmological arguments are, at the very least, an expression of a dissatisfaction with the contingent nature of our existence.34 The ability to believe in a necessary being, one whose existence is in no way contingent, has then been for many a source of comfort in the face of the world's contingency. If, however, we admit that God could bring about his own non-existence, it is a contin- gent matter of fact that he does not do so, and the existence of God is, after all, a contingent matter. Such a contingent being does not seem ade- quately to fill the needs of those who feel themselves dependent, limited and contingent and in need of a necessary ground of all being as an ade- quate object of worship. The second possibility is this. Suppose we ask what makes the greatest possible being as Anselm, Malcolm and Findlay have described him, so great. One would have to argue as follows: the object of the religious attitude must be the greatest of all possible beings. Suppose this being could annihilate himself. Then, contrary to hypothesis, he would not be the greatest possible being, for we could imagine a yet greater one, namely a being that could not annihilate himself. Put thus the greatness of the greatest possible being amounts only to the fact that his existence could have no beginning and no end. Someone now might try to undermine the claim that this is the greatest possible being in the following way. 14</page><page sequence="15">ON THE COHERENCE OF CHRISTIAN ATHEISM Assume it possible that God might realize that it would be of supreme advantage to mankind that he bring about his own non-existence. We cannot, I think, rule out such a possibility a priori. If a time comes in which this act of self annihilation is required, a necessary being would find himself unable to perform the act. Couldn't someone now say that this being would have been a greater being, a more fitting object of worship, had he been able, given a sufficiently good reason, to perform the supreme moral act and bring about his own demise? He does not, in the case I have imagined, increase in stature merely by being logically immortal, but his stature would be increased if he had the possibility of making a sup- reme moral gesture. A being who could bring about his own demise would be a being with greater moral possibilities. Suppose now we ask the following question: "which is the greater being, one who cannot annihilate himself even if he had a morally compelling reason for doing so, or one who, given a certain compelling need would be able, by self- annihilation, to fulfil a certain possibility of moral grandeur?". If we cleave to the interpretation of "greatest possible being" that comes down to us from Anselm, certain moral acts, e.g. acts of supreme self-sacrifice, acts of love, are impossible for the greatest being. We might think such an object is less fitting as an object of religious devotion. 35 The upshot of what I have said amounts to this. It might be possible to construct a sense of "greatest possible being" in which necessary exist- ence is not part of the meaning of "greatest possible being", and in this case a being capable of certain sorts of moral grandeur might, although not necessarily existent, be greater than one with mere necessary existence. I should point out additionally that we cannot dodge the problem I am posing here by saying that the greatest possible being would be one with necessary existence and these possibilities of moral grandeur, for the possibility of performing the supreme moral act as I have imagined it is incompatible with the possession of necessary existence. I have asked, therefore, if the tie between the expression "being than which a greater cannot be conceived" and "necessary being" should be loosened. If we do loosen it in the way I suggest, then it will not be impossible for the satement "God is dead" to be taken literally, and we must then find other ways of criticizing such thinkers at Altizer. Readers of Altizer will in fact know that Altizer does construe the death of God as the supreme act of God's love for man. God, seeing that men must of necessity suffer certain undesirable consequences if a transcendent being exists, has a morally good reason for self-annihilation. What should seem more natural than that the God of love should perform that act of self-annihilation as an expression of His love. The line of argument I have been pursuing raises, of course, a funda- mental question for philosophical theology. How does one decide between candidate descriptions of the greatest being? If I ask "which is greater, a being with necessary existence who is not able to perform the 15</page><page sequence="16">PHILOSOPHY greatest moral act or a being without necessary existence who can perform this act?" how is the question to be decided? On thing is certain, how- ever. Until we do know how to decide such questions we must defer our final assessment of the logic of Altizer's Christian Atheism and our ulti- mate decision as the possibility of its truth. XII I want in conclusion to point out the bearing of what I have said on Norman Malcolm's version of the ontological argument. Malcolm's argument is based on the claim that God is, by definition, a necessary being. The argument seems to be that such a necessary being must by definition, exist. Schematically, the argument begins with (i) the claim that "God is a necessary being" then adds (ii) a proof that a necessary being, as so defined by Malcolm, must exist, and finally concludes (iii) that God exists. Various powerful arguments have been brought against step (ii). 36 In the light of the foregoing we can however ask questions about the first step of this proof, (i) in the schema. The implication of my argument in Section XI above is that even if Malcolm has shown that a necessary being exists he has not shown that God exists. The argument is defective until we have a proof that "God" means "necessary being". As I have said, I am not sure what such a proof could be. Malcolm, to be sure cites many writers in the Christian tradition who have maintained that God is a necessary being. All this shows, however, is that those who do believe that "God" means "necessary being" may be able to prove that God as so defined exists. It does not show that this necessarily existent being is the greatest conceivable being, the most adequate object of worship and hence God properly so called. I suspect, however, that the God Malcolm thinks is the most adequate object of worship need not be a necessary being. Thus he writes: "Why is it that human beings have even formed the concept of an infinite being? .... I wish . . . . to make one suggestion (which should not be understood as autobiographical). There is the phenomenon of feeling guilt for something that one has done or thought or felt or for a disposition one has. One wants to be free of this guilt. But sometimes the guilt is felt to be so great that one is sure that nothing one could do oneself, nor any forgiveness by any other human being, would remove it. One feels a guilt that is beyond all measure, a guilt 'a greater than which cannot be conceived'. Para- doxically, it would seem, one nevertheless has the intense desire to have this incomparable guilt removed. One requires a forgiveness that is beyond all measure, a forgiveness 'a greater than which cannot be conceived'. Out of such a storm in the soul, I am suggesting, there arises the concept of a forgiving mercy that is limitless, beyond all measure .... There is that human phenomenon of an unbearably 16</page><page sequence="17">ON THE COHERENCE OF CHRISTIAN ATHEISM heavy conscience and it is importantly connected with the genesis of the concept of God, that is with the formation of the 'grammar' of the word 'God'."37 Malcolm believes that the greatest possible guilt has, for some, led to the concept of the greatest possible being. He may be right. My ques- ion, however, is about the content of this phrase "being than which a greater cannot be conceived". If the greatest possible being is the one that could relieve our infinite guilt, then it need not, I am suggesting, be a necessary being, one that could not cease to exist. Indeed, as Altizer suggests, such a being might be required to annihilate himself in order to relieve this guilt. Given, then, that Malcolm's account of the genesis of the notion of God is correct, it does not follow, I think, that this being must be thought of as a necessary being. The University of Lancaster.

Although my classification is somewhat like that proposed by Montgomery, I do not think he makes sufficient distinction between what he calls "literalists" and "non-literalists". Van Buren, Hamilton and Altizer are all classed together by Montgomery whereas I want to show that Altizer is a man on his own in the Death of God movement. I do not think that either Pailin or Montgomery fully realize the fundamental philosophical issues raised by Altizer's attempt to assert that God is literally dead. 5See William Hamilton, "The Shape of Radical Theology" in The Christian Century LXXXII 1965 and van Buren op. cit. p. 103.

I don't think we have to make the case in terms of God as a moral agent, though I would prefer to since this allows me to talk of the God of love. Professor Smart has pointed out to me that we can construct the case I have in mind by reference to many other sorts of acts, e.g. the supremely impressive act might conceivably not be possible for a being that could not cease to exist. This still of course leaves difficulties about anthropomorphism, but those I do not consider here. I am interested in beliefs about God that are held by many religious people and with certain difficulties raised in the context of these beliefs. 36Cf.
