<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Philosophy Quarterly Volume 3, Number 1, January 1986 COLLINGWOOD: A PHILOSOPHER OF AMBIVALENCE Lorraine B. Code I IN his Autobiography1 R. G. Collingwood characterizes metaphysics as a historical endeavour which attempts "...at any given time...to dis cover what the people of that time believe about the world's general nature; such beliefs being the presuppositions of all their "physics'..." (p. 66). The metaphysician is a historian who attempts to discover "...the corresponding presuppositions of other peoples and other times, and to follow the historical process by which one set of presuppositions has turned into another" (loc. cit.). This view is sustained and elaborated in the Essay on Metaphysics2, where metaphysics is characterized as a historical sci ence. Every putatively metaphysical investigation is properly to be seen as a historical enquiry, Collingwood believes. It proceeds through analysis of the scientific thinking of a particular people, a particular epoch, or, perhaps, a particular individual, with the aim of discovering the absolute presuppositions which underlie this thinking. The ideal metaphysician historian is wholly objective in this investigation, offering no evaluation of the absolute presuppositions unearthed, while granting these presup positions a status in relation to the particular body of thought which somehow places them in a realm where questions about their ultimate validity simply do not arise. Collingwood writes: It is a mistake...to fancy that by investigating the truth of their absolute presuppositions a metaphysician could show that one school of science was fundamentally right and another fundamentally wrong. The "embarrassing problem" does not arise. (Essay on Metaphysics, p. 52-3) One is inclined from the outset to consider a goal of such detachment, at least in its strongest formulation, to be beyond the limitations of phil osophical enquiry. Even the historian is rarely, if ever, capable of so absolute an objectivity. And if a professed metaphysician were to succeed in offering so objective an account of metaphysical presuppositions in their historical evolution one would, at the very least, regard this as a preliminary exercise, to be followed by a statement of the metaphysician's own position. For it seems to be a tacit assumption of philosophy as such?perhaps even one of its absolute presuppositions?that the philos 107</page><page sequence="2">108 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY opher will either profess affinities with a particular way of thinking, or will set forward a Weltanschauung of his/her own. The philosopher is expected both to be committed to a point of view, and to be creative, as well as to record and/or to analyse historical ways of thinking. Nor was Collingwood himself, in practice, capable of attaining the austere ideal he set for the metaphysician. In The Idea of Nature3, where he is engaged in just the kind of investigation described above, one sees evidence of a constantly shifting allegiance to two central trends in the history of Western philosophy. This dichotomy is evident, too, if to a lesser extent, in The Idea of History,4 The Principles of Art,5 and The New Leviathan.6 Yet Collingwood's failure to achieve this ideal of total objectivity is not a failure in any absolute sense: it is precisely what makes his philosophy interesting, and deserving of the designation "his philosophy." For purposes of this discussion, I take the modes of thought which Collingwood found alternately attractive and repellent to be roughly characterizable as the Platonic and the Aristotelian mode. In what follows, I consider each of these modes to be a broad and varied stream of thought which, in the case of the Platonic mode, can be traced through rationalism and Hegelianism to the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead; and, in the case of the Aristotelian mode, through empiricism and realism to the philosophy of Samuel Alexander.7 There are, evidently, large areas of overlap between these Platonic and Aristotelian ways of thinking, and the depth of Plato's influence upon Aristotle is apparent throughout the latter's thought. But the significant differences, which inspire Col lingwood's ambivalent affinities, are those between the Platonic view that the ultimately real is the world of Forms or Ideas adumbrated in mathematical models, coupled with a distrust of empirical science; and the Aristotelian view that individual substances have the greatest reality, and that empirical science can yield reliable, true knowledge. Collingwood's persistent, if avowedly repudiated, Hegelianism and his dislike of twentieth century realism seem to lead him towards the Platonic way of thinking. But his respect for natural science (at least as it is manifested in the Essay on Metaphysics and later works) make Aris totelianism more attractive, particularly in view of the fact that his idealist affinities can be accommodated within Aristotelian theology and teleology. Yet he is sceptical about the value of Aristotelian logic as a tool of enquiry, preferring a Platonic, dialectic approach to philosophical questions through what he calls a logic of "Question and Answer" (cf. e.g. Autobiography, ch. V). I think one can best view his philosophical position as a sort of Neo-Platonic-Aristotelianism, or Neo-Aristotelian Platonism; one in which the elements of the combination are frequently in strife one against the other. II Certainly the influence both of Plato and of Aristotle on Collingwood's</page><page sequence="3">COLLINGWOOD: A PHILOSOPHER OF AMBIVALENCE 109 philosophical thinking is considerable. T. M. Knox mentions in his Preface to The Idea of History that Collingwood used to say Plato was his favourite philosopher; and in the Autobiography Collingwood writes: "I had become something of a specialist in Aristotle" (p. 27). This is not unusual in the development of a philosopher's thought, nor are the two ways of thinking necessarily incompatible or contradictory within the framework of a par ticular philosophical position. Yet Collingwood's assimilation of the two tendencies seems to have given rise to a dichotomy within his philosophy as a whole, perhaps because of the particular aspects of each which he came to emphasize.8 This as as true of his philosophical method as it is of the specific content of his writings. One might, in general, be inclined to regard a philosopher's method as something peripheral to his/her philosophy as a whole: as the ladder to be thrown away when a fully-developed point of view has been achieved. But given that Collingwood plainly has a strong preference for the Platonic dialectical method, while at the same time rejecting central principles of Aristotelian logic; and given, too, that dialectical reasoning in its purest form was, for Plato, the way of doing philosophy par excellence, it is worthwhile examining the implications of Collingwood's methodolog ical views in the light of these considerations. It is especially useful to do so in recognition of his apparent preference for Aristotelian conclusions, reached by Platonic methods. In Part I of the Essay on Metaphysics, Collingwood acknowledges Aris totle as the first metaphysician. This is not just because Aristotle's Metaphysics was the first work in the history of philosophy to bear that title (a title well known not to have been Aristotle's own). It is primarily because most of the subject-matter of this work is, for Collingwood, metaphysics properly so called: "...the science whose subject-matter is logically prior to that of every other, the science which is logically presup posed by all other sciences, although in the order of study it comes last" (E. M., p. 5). Moreover, and the significance of this for Collingwood will become apparent later: "Sometimes he calls it Theology,...or the science which expounds the nature of God" (E. M., p. 6). At the same time Collingwood rejects Aristotle's contention that metaphysics should be conceived as ontology, claiming that a science of pure being would, in effect, have no subject matter. One would have thought that Collingwood's own metaphysical credo would, at the very least, have obliged him to consider the historical reasons for Aristotle's having accorded ontology such importance. Furthermore, at least in this work, where the nature of metaphysics is the central topic of discussion, he does not mention that Aristotle efficiently performs the most important task that he (i.e. Collingwood) claims for the metaphysician: that of recording the presuppositions of the science of his day, as well as those of the natural scientists and philosophers who preceded him, even though this task is performed without the full objectivity Collingwood demands. (In The Idea of Nature he does acknowledge Aristotle's having done this;</page><page sequence="4">110 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY but it is curious that he does not mention it here, in his most complete account of the appropriate task and nature of metaphysics.) What seems most curious is that, while he is aware that Aristotle's work was given the title Metaphysics after the author's death, he does not acknowledge, at least here, that Plato had preceded Aristotle with a full-blown metaphysical system of the sort which was to recur throughout the rationalist tradition in the history of philosophy. It is of course true that Plato did not see metaphysics as a science; and it seems to be the case, too, that Plato, unlike Aristotle, did not have a scheme for the classification of the sciences. So one might argue that Platonic thought does not fit with metaphysical enquiries into the absolute presuppositions of natural science. Nonetheless, some allusion to Plato at this point?even as an "improper" metaphysician because of his failure to engage in histor ical enquiry?would seem to be in order. This is particularly so in view of the arbitrariness of the title Metaphysics; of Collingwood's standards of historical exactitude; and of Aristotle's constant attempts to refute Plato throughout the Metaphysics: attempts which amount to a tacit acknowledgement that Plato's aims were at least similar enough to his own that they could be attacked on the some ground. A reference to Plato at this stage of the discussion would seem all the more pertinent in view of the fact that Collingwood proceeds to advocate that a Socratic-Platonic method be used by the metaphysician in his/her new-found task as histo rian. It is clear that he believes the ensuing enquiry will have an appro priate shape, if conducted according to this method, precisely because it will bear the stamp of the method. This method, which is to supersede the logic of propositions, "...the doctrine which is presupposed by all the various well-known theories of truth" (Autobiography, p. 36), is Collingwood's logic of question and answer. In order to follow it, the metaphysician must recognize that statements or propositions give only half of the picture which constitutes a particular body of thought: the other equally important and generally unarticulated half is comprised of the question or questions which the propositions were put forward to answer. The metaphysician's major task, then, is not just to examine the propositions themselves, submitting them to the test of Aristotelian or modern propositional logic to determine their truth or falsity, or their coherence or lack of coherence within a system. Rather, the point is to set about disentangling the entire complex of questions and answers which will be seen to make up any philosophical theory, analysing this complex to determine what questions the state ments of the theory were put forward to answer, and what presuppositions can be found to underlie these question. For Collingwood maintains that the asking of any question involves some sort of presuppositions about the world. As he observes: Every metaphysical question either is simply the question what absolute presuppositions were made on a certain occasion, or is capable of being resolved into a number of such questions together with a further question</page><page sequence="5">COLLINGWOOD: A PHILOSOPHER OF AMBIVALENCE 111 or further questions arising out of these. (Essay on Metaphysics, p. 49.) The end-point of the metaphysician's analysis of question-and-answer complexes will be the discovery of the absolute presuppositions upon which the Weltanschauung of a particular people in a particular era was based. That he considers the method similar to the Socratic dialectical method is evident from Collingwood's remark in the Autobiography that, in an assessment of the reasoning behind a particular philosophical system, one will take that answer to be "right" which makes it possible for the questioning and answering process to proceed to its next stage. This right answer will not necessarily be a "true" statement in any sort of timeless or absolute sense. For, as Collingwood remarks: Cases are quite common in which the "right" answer to a question is "false;" for example, cases in which a thinker is following a false scent, either inadvertently or in order to construct a reductio ad absurdum. (Ibid. p. 37.) An example from Plato's Republic follows to illustrate the point. Concomitant with the view that a "right" answer is one which enables the dialectical process to continue, all other logical considerations aside, is a repudiation of Aristotle's supremely respected principle of non-con tradiction, at least in its logical-epistemological implications. Col lingwood maintains that statements within a theory which, on the surface, appear to contradict one another, are frequently found not to do so when one analyzes the theory to discover the questions they were put forward to answer. He claims that contradictions which modern-day realists, fol lowing the rules of propositional logic, purport to find in philosophical systems are generally "...the fruit of their own historical errors as to the questions which their victims had been trying to answer" (Autobiography p. 42). Nevertheless, while he seems convincingly to reject Aristotle's logical formulation of the principle (namely, that it is not true that two contradictory propositions hold); it is not clear that he wants to, or could, reject its ontological formulation (namely, that the same attribute cannot at the same time belong and not belong to the same subject and in the same respect). Moreover, he is quite explicit in maintaining that Aristo tle's notion of metaphysics as first science, deducible from certain basic principles, is entirely fallacious, as is plain from his observation that: "Metaphysics, aware of itself as a historical science, will abandon once for all the hope of being a deductive or quasi-mathematical science." (Essay on Metaphysics, p. 67) One further point should be made with reference to Collingwood's gen eral view of metaphysics as historical enquiry. He regards as a "vulgar error, consequent on a kind of historical myopia which, deceived by sup erficial resemblances, failed to detect profound differences..." (Autobiog raphy, p. 60-1) the idea that the problems of philosophy are in any sense eternal. The notion that philosophy is concerned with problems which</page><page sequence="6">112 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY are unchanging and have not changed from pre-Socratic times to the twentieth century is, he believes, largely responsible for the failure of philosophers to understand that their basic and most important task is to be historians, enquirers who disentangle and arrange clusters of pre suppositions with a view to understanding the scientific thought of an era. This seems to be an Aristotelian way, at least in part, of looking at the matter: and a useful way as well. In the Categories9 Aristotle considers each particular "whiteness," for example, as an individual, perceived within its own setting, where its quality of whiteness can be seen to be at least partially dependent upon its context. Such an approach can be extended to a consideration of abstract ideas, where it will lead to the realization, for example, that Aristotle and Kant have something quite different in mind when they discuss "duty;" and the same is true of Plato and Hobbes when they discuss "the state." Investigations of the contexts in which theoretical ideas are discussed must certainly lead to a clearer understanding of what a thinker is attempting to do, Collingwood maintains. He does not believe that it is justifiable to go on to ask whether the particular thinker is right or wrong to think this way. But even if one agrees with his insistence on the necessity to reserve judgement, it seems likely that one's understanding of the theory in question would be improved by a discovery of the presuppositions upon which it is based. On the matter of eternal questions Collingwood is not entirely consis tent, however. Both in The Idea of Nature and in the Essay on Metaphysics he seems to want to regard the absolute presupposition "God exists" as eternal to the extent that it can be discovered in an almost identical form at the basis of the metaphysical thinking of philosophers as unlike, and as chronologically distant one from the other as Thaies, Kant, and Whitehead. The curious elaboration in The Idea of History of the thesis that one can re-think the philosophy of another philosopher, and thus know it as he knew it further complicates the entire issue. For Collingwood writes: In its immediacy, as an actual experience of his own, Plato's argument must undoubtedly have grown up out of a discussion of some sort, though I do not know what it was, and been closely connected with such a discussion. Yet if I not only read his argument but understand it, follow it in my own mind by re-arguing it with and for myself, the process of argument which I go through is not a process resembling Plato's, it actually is Plato's, so far as I understand him rightly. (The Idea of History, p. 301.) Here there is an evident inconsistency with the metaphilosophy of the Essay on Metaphysics: one which might be resolvable, self-referentially, if we could show that, in the interval between the writing of the two works, Collingwood's own absolute presuppositions about the nature of philosophy have undergone a transformation, so that he is now asking and answering different questions. Out of this apparent transformation arises one of his most interesting contributions to philosophy: what is</page><page sequence="7">COLLINGWOOD: A PHILOSOPHER OF AMBIVALENCE 113 now often called the "empathetic approach" to the history of thought. Ill Collingwood maintains that Plato, by claiming the highest degree of reality for a supernatural realm, rejects the possibility of natural science. For Aristotle, on the other hand, individual substances have the greatest reality, and natural science is a centrally important source of knowledge. Here it is possible to see an explanation for Collingwood's dislike of Platonism, while at the same time understanding his admiration for it, both aesthetically and methodologically. This could also suggest an expla nation for his inclination to return to a Platonic world view in his admi ration for Whitehead, who did not by any means reject the possibility of natural science, but was a scientist of repute and, at the same time, an idealist philosopher. It is against the background of these considerations that an examination of The Idea of Nature is particularly interesting; for this is Collingwood's full-length investigation of metaphysics as history. Collingwood was engaged in revising the manuscript of the lectures which comprise The Idea of Nature at the same time as he was writing the Essay on Metaphysics, possibly in order to bring his own metaphysical endeavours more closely into line with the ideals he was setting forth in the latter work. But certainly he has not produced a detached and uncom mitted account of the history of the presuppositions of natural science. In The Idea of Nature Collingwood divides the history of European thought into what he calls three periods of "constructive cosmological thinking": the Greek, the Renaissance, and the Modern view. He is primarily interested in the first and third of these phases, for he sees the middle phase as a mechanistic, materialistic one in which the principles of causation, and the laws of nature in general, form a complete antithesis to his own view that there is a kind of anthropomorphic causality at work in nature, and presupposed by natural science. The natural scientist undertakes a detailed study of fact; the philosopher reflects on the prin ciples of natural science, bringing them from the unconscious to the con scious level, both for himself, and for the natural scientist. The latter, once aware of this, is able to proceed with a new firmness and consistency. All of this is quite in keeping with the ideals expressed in the Essay on Metaphysics, though Collingwood's own avowed preference for a par ticular kind of presupposition is less clearly in accord with his originally declared goal. In his summary of the changes and shifts from one to another of these three main cosmological views in the history of science, one can see Collingwood's commitment to a semi-anthropomorphic view of cosmology, and of nature in general: a commitment more explicitly discussed in Part III of the Essay on Metaphysics. And throughout the work, Collingwood's own way of holding the absolute presupposition "God exists" is read into those periods in the history of cosmology which he sees as its high points.</page><page sequence="8">114 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Thus, in Collingwood's view, Greek natural science is based on the principle that the world of nature is saturated or permeated by mind; though one might well wonder whether either Plato or Aristotle, not to mention many of the pre-Socratics (e.g. the atomists) would agree with him. In the Renaissance view (the name he gives to the science of Galileo, Descartes, and Newton, inter alia) he finds a denial of the view that the world as studied by physical science is to be considered to be an organism; coupled with an assertion of the claim that it is devoid both of intelligence and of life. The modern view, however, is interpreted as based in an analogy between the processes of the natural world as studied by the natural sciences, and the vicissitudes of human affairs as studied by historians. This is an evolutionary conception of nature, where nature is held to be comprised of teleological processes. It is already apparent that, here, he is thinking of a Whiteheadean world view. And, in his claim that "...the self-consciousness of man, his historical consciousness of his own corporate doings, provided a clue to his thoughts about nature" (Idea of Nature, p. 13), there are interesting Jungian overtones. Collingwood's interpretation of Greek cosmology again gives evidence of his ambivalent Platonic-Aristotelian affinities. It shows, too, his need to read a particular kind of "God exists" presupposition into the most widely divergent world views. Indeed, in his discussion of the Ionians, he sees the only real progress toward an understanding of the processes of nature to have been made by those philosophers into whose thought he can read a monistic world view, where some sort of supremely intelli gent being is held responsible for all movement and change. Along with this goes the contention that any attempt to build a cosmology upon a materialistic foundation must be a "false move." Yet if these are the absolute presuppositions of the cosmology under discussion, Collingwood's own principles should not allow him to judge such a move as true or false. "Tha?es appears to have distinguished this primitive matter from God, but his successors identified the two...," Collingwood writes (Idea of Nature, p. 40). One wonders whether it is Tha?es and his successors, or Collingwood, who think of a God, and identify or fail to identify him with "primitive matter." Again, it is difficult to see how it is possible, on Collingwood's terms, to claim that Anaximenes has "broken the rules;" and, moreover, to express approval for his having done so as well as to imply that the originality involved in such rule-breaking corrects defects in the game of physics as it is played in his time. Here the metaphysician is allowed to do much more than simply to catalogue the presuppositions of his age: he can introduce an evaluative reference to an element of originality which goes so far as to characterize this originality as productive of the only possible progress in metaphysics and in science. Perhaps, in this regard, it makes more sense to emphasize the section in the Essay on Metaphysics where Collingwood stresses the dynamic nature of history: his view that "One phase changes into another because the first phase</page><page sequence="9">COLLINGWOOD: A PHILOSOPHER OF AMBIVALENCE 115 was in unstable equilibrium and had in itself the seeds of change, and indeed ofthat change... Where there is no strain there is no history" (p. 74-5). This is the less astringent aspect of the picture of the metaphysician historian as cataloguer: and the side Collingwood seems to favour in his own cataloguing endeavours. The metaphysician's job, on this reading, includes pointing to, and perhaps anticipating and preparing the way for moments of change. Platonic and Aristotelian cosmology are described in a most puzzling fashion. While both systems are accorded high esteem, it is never clear whether, for example, in the discussion of Plato, Plato is being made to speak in Aristotle's language, or vice versa. Of Plato's theory of forms, Collingwood writes: Relatively to the behaviour of the things in which it exists, form is essence or nature. Relatively to the human mind that studies it, form is not percep tible, like the things that go to make up the natural world: it is intelligible. (Idea of Nature, p. 55-6) Certainly the second of these statements gives accurate information about Plato's forms. But the first is much more plainly Aristotelian. It is Aris totle who claims that the essence of beings is most easily understood in their formal nature. And this is quite a different kind of form from those which exist in Plato's transcendent realm. Nor would Plato say, at least generally, that the form exists in things in nature (though it does seem, for example in the Phaedo, that he might at times consider the form to be both immanent and transcendent). The more usual Platonic view, however, is that things participate in the forms. Hence this is a context where Collingwood seems to blur distinctions between Plato and Aristotle, perhaps because of his inclination to adopt a philosophical position which is a combination of what he finds best in each. Moreover, to read an immanence-transcendence theory of forms into Plato, one which becomes a sort of theology, and is rewritten sometimes in Aristotle's language and sometimes in Whitehead's, is a move which seems to be not entirely true to Collingwood's own lights. Commentators on Plato's philosophy are by no means agreed that the Good is God; nor does the claim that this is an unconsciously-held absolute presupposition which becomes apparent in Plato's use of language say anything more than that this is the way Collingwood reads Plato's language. Further more, one can only see it as a move to save Plato as a scientist-cum-phi losopher to write, as Collingwood does: "...even in his most one-sidedly transcendent phase Plato by anticipation defends...what we nowadays call the empirical sciences of nature..." (Idea of Nature, p. 70). Evidence in support of this claim, in Plato's own writings, is hard to find, given the "lesser" reality of empirical entities. Much more interesting, particularly as an attempt to resolve his ambi valent reactions to Plato's philosophy, is Collingwood's discussion of Whitehead and Plato. For Plato's natural cosmology as it occurs in the</page><page sequence="10">116 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Timaeus is seen by Whitehead to provide "the philosophical setting required by the ideas of modern physical science" (Idea of Nature, p. 79). It is in its modern, Whiteheadean form that Collingwood is able to accept Platonism with many fewer reservations. Aristotle's attempts to move away from Platonic philosophy are gener ally glossed over in Collingwood's account, and pride of place is given to his (i.e. Aristotle's) theology. This is interesting, for early in the Essay on Metaphysics Collingwood criticizes Aristotle's occasional equation of metaphysics and theology. Yet in the Idea of Nature it is evident that for Collingwood, too, metaphysics is largely theology: a fact which is apparent also in Part III of the Essay on Metaphysics. In fact, his discussion of Aristotle's theology is as puzzling as the discussion of Plato's theory of forms. One wonders if he is reading Aristotle's theology into Plato, or Plato's putative theology into Aristotle. He writes: God in the Timaeus certainly thinks the forms; therefore, according to Aristotle, God and the forms are not two, but one. The forms are the ways in which God thinks, their dialectical structure is the articulation of His thought; and conversely God is the activity whose diverse aspects we are describing whenever we identify this or that form. This identification of God with the forms removes all the objections brought by Aristotle against the Platonic theory of forms... (The Idea of Nature, p. 87.) This surely cannot be construed to be Collingwood following a process of thought which actually is Aristotle's. One can only regard it as another example of his attempt to construct a philosophical position which con tains within itself the polarities of thought to be found within Plato and Aristotle. For purposes of this discussion, the middle section ofThe Idea of Nature, which deals with the Renaissance idea of nature, is less important. This is the period Collingwood sees as entirely materialistic: a period which denies God, or at least sees Him to be utterly alien to nature. Nature, on this view, is devoid of vital energy; all that is real in nature is mechan ical, measurable, and quantitive. Even those philosophers who discuss God at length see Him to be wholly removed from nature. Therefore, Collingwood believes, the philosophy of the era (a lengthy period of time which stretches from the Middle Ages to Hegel) is, in general, arid and devoid of interest. The implication is that because Collingwood can find in all of these many and diverse philosophers no place for his preferred sense of causation, i.e., the "historical" sense, in which every event in nature can be seen to be caused by an immanent, rational agent, these philosophies are lacking in value. Such a value judgment certainly goes against the tenets of Part I of the Essay on Metaphysics. The discussion of modern cosmology brings Collingwood's Platonic Aristotelianism (or vice versa) back into the foreground. Here, if the analogy is not pushed too far, the Aristotelianism emerges in Alexander's philosophy, and the Platonism in Whitehead's. But Collingwood comes</page><page sequence="11">COLLINGWOOD: A PHILOSOPHER OF AMBIVALENCE 117 down in favour of Whitehead, and is able to find in his process philosophy those elements of Aristotelianism, too, which most attract him. Both Alexander and Whitehead, at least tacitly, accept the absolute presupposition "God exists," both put forward a cosmology of process in which not only mind and life, but matter, too, is inherently and essentially active. Alexander sees the world as a single cosmic process in which, as it goes on, there emerge higher orders of being, each genuinely and qual itatively new. Mind is a pattern of vital activities whose evolutionary drive is directed towards the being of God. Thus God permeates all, and everything is in process toward God. the chief weakness in Alexander's philosophy, however, Collingwood claims, is its strain of empiricism. For he tells us that the business of philosophy is not to argue or to explain, but simply to observe and record facts. This, I think, is the Aristotelian element in Alexander which Collingwood rejects in favour of Whitehead's Platonism, with an Aristotelian overlap. Furthermore, he rejects Alexan der's peculiarly upside-down version of the "God exists" presupposition, claiming that with respect to this most crucial point, too, Whitehead is more successful. Whitehead's philosophy contains both immanent and transcendent relation of qualities to forms. Whitehead rises beyond Alexander's empiri cism in his identification of the known with necessary and eternal truths of a Platonic sort; and Whitehead has reconstructed the Aristotelian conception of God, making God both immanent and transcendent. Causa tion, too, for Whitehead, is an anthropomorphic concept in which the organism, which is the world, is in a constant process of creative advance, taking and producing new forms in every part of itself. For Collingwood, Whitehead puts forward a philosophical position in which the polarities that run through his own thinking can be reconciled. For in Whitehead's thought, as Collingwood puts it: ...a Platonic cosmology may be seen, in the pages o? Process and Reality, turning into an Aristotelian. Thus the cycle of cosmological thought in the modern world, from Descartes to Newton to Whitehead, recapitulates the cycle running from Tha?es to Aristotle. (The Idea of Nature, p. 170.) IV The conflicting points of view evident within the Essay on Metaphysics make the characterization of Collingwood as a philosopher of ambivalence a particularly appropriate one. The Essay itself is most interestingly viewed as a work within the scope of which a thesis-antithesis-synthesis development of ideas takes place. In Part I, the thesis section, one can see the influence of the Oxford realists on Collingwood's thought. While his Autobiography attests to the fact that he deplores much of the realists' thinking; and while he does reject their logic even here; the extreme objectivity of the approach to metaphysics advocated in this section of the book indicates something of a realist reaction against the excesses</page><page sequence="12">118 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY of his Hegelian period. The method urged here for the science of metaphysics is austere to the point that a philosophy which proceeded along these lines would be both uninteresting and entirely uncreative: in fact, philosophy as we know it would be virtually eradicated. It is interesting to recall Collingwood's Autobiography criticism of the Oxford realists, for their failure to teach moral philosophy in a manner which would enable their students to develop moral values of their own. For this section of the Essay advocates a method which expressly excludes evaluation. Part II, the antithesis section of the book, is wildly irrational: as irra tional, at least, as the positions it purports to attack. It is difficult to see why this should be so, particularly with regard to the attacks on psychol ogy, which are unreasonable, and even trivial to the extent of scarcely meriting a rejoinder. The methods of attack violate Collingwood's own principles; for he quotes Spearman out of context, making no attempt to understand what question the latter's apparently contradictory remarks were meant to answer. And his charge of plagiarism, also levelled against Spearman, is barely recognizable as the remark of a man who claims that natural science has always existed in a historical context, dependent on historical thought for its existence. His attacks on positivism are perhaps more easily understood, in that the positivists represent the same dehumanizing tendency in philosophy which he deplores in the realists (though it is interesting to note that he, too, uses positivistic arguments against system-building metaphysics). The synthesis section, Part III, is both less austere and less irrational. Although the specimina philosophandi which he offers in illustration of the newly-advocated approach to metaphysics are put forward as exam ples of the objective, purely historical kind of investigation recommended in Part I, this is certainly not what they are. Particularly in the section devoted to "The Existence of God" and "Causation," no attempt is made to give an objective, historical analysis of these concepts as they may or may not have played the role of absolute presuppositions at particular periods in the history of thought. Here philosophy becomes a Wel tanschauung of a personal nature, where evaluative judgements are made, and specific points of view with regard to the questions under considera tion are recommended as those which ought to be held if natural science and civilization are to progress. There seems here to reemerge an idealistic-theistic strand, which carries the force of an absolute presuppos ition, and runs as a sort of Leitmotiv through Collingwood's work, despite his avowal of allegiance to a goal of complete objectivity. The anthropomorphic theory of causation which Collingwood defends in this section has far-reaching consequences, particularly in matters of ethics, for it seems effectively to remove any element of contingency from the course of history, and to make human beings ultimately responsible for everything that befalls them. How Collingwood would deal with trad itionally-designated "acts of God" such as floods and earthquakes within</page><page sequence="13">COLLINGWOOD: A PHILOSOPHER OF AMBIVALENCE 119 this theory of causation is difficult to decide. But its implications for the historian-philosopher are such that it becomes his responsibility, as Col lingwood characterizes it, to "construct a science of human affairs...from which men could deal with human situations as skillfully as natural science had taught them to deal with situations in the world of Nature" (Autobiography, p. 115). Collingwood does not spell out an ethical theory of any completeness, at least in his published works. (His lectures on ethics have since been presented to the Bodleian Library.) But it is evident from the above quotation, as well as from his criticisms of the realists earlier in the Autobiography, that he regards it as the philosopher's business to be a "co-ordinator of values" (to borrow a phrase from Piaget) as well as a historian of absolute presuppositions. In The New Leviathan he leans toward an Aristotelian rather than a Platonic view of ethics, though it is apparent that he has considered both. He emphasizes the elements of tyranny and oppression which many commentators see in Plato's Repub lic, equating Plato's philosopher-king with a Hitler-like tyrant. (See The New Leviathan, p. 191) The Aristotelian view of happiness as the end of human life is one he applauds and elaborates, distinguishing it approv ingly from the utilitarian ideal of happiness, equated with pleasure and the absence of pain. Aristotle, by happiness, implies the full realization of "the human good;" and this Collingwood endorses (The New Leviathan, p. 84-5). While it may make considerable sense to be critical of Collingwood for his failure to live up to his own view of metaphysics, as it is expressed in Part I of the Essay on Metaphysics, one need not consider the ideal worthless on these grounds alone. Perhaps historicism in the sense orig inally advocated is an untenable position, at least in the extreme form of its initial articulation. But this does not necessitate a total repudiation of the historicist way of thinking as such, nor of the individual, valuable points that emerge from a consideration of it. I think one must credit Collingwood with important insights into the reasons for philosophical dogmatism, and with the formulation of a programme, both in the Autobiography and the Essay on Metaphysics, which would, he thought, enable him to avoid it. If, in his further exploration of the ideal, he tended to lean toward the acceptance of certain of the metaphysical theories he examined, one cannot, I think, condemn him on this ground alone. One can, perhaps, say that he required of himself a more-than-human objec tivity, in full realization of the fact that absolute presuppositions are deeply affecting and subjective in character. I am inclined to think that he does not lose sight of his ideal, even though some of the pieces of the puzzle he is putting together have more emotional and/or intellectual appeal for him than others. "The history of thought, and therefore all history, is the re-enactment of past thought in the historian's own mind," Collingwood writes (Idea of History, p. 215). But the historian's mind is not a tabula rasa: hence</page><page sequence="14">120 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY it is foolish to expect that he should sift and re-arrange past thought as a neutral observer. And it is all the more reasonable that Collingwood should cull something from Plato, and something from Aristotle, and come up with a patchwork in which certain colours predominate. It is worthwhile to point once again to Collingwood's recognition of strains in history; for it seems valid to infer that he recognized such shifting strains in his own thought. These strains are not to be attributed to his illness, and thus dismissed. It is too easy to attribute everything aberrant or inconsistent in a person's thinking to so readily available a cause. They should be attributed much more to his deep insight into the breadth and diversity of human thought, wherein Heracleitean polarities can and do exist side by side, and the principle of non-contradiction does not always hold, even for one who is inclined to be an Aristotelian in much of his thought.

In a sense, one might say that all subsequent philosophers have been partly Platonists and partly Aristotelian, leaning perhaps more towards one mode than towards the other. Clearly there are elements of rationalism in Locke's philosophy, for example, just as there are elements of empiricism in Descartes' philosophy. But what is striking about Collingwood in the constant intermingling of the two modes, whose presence, too, is more explicitly evident than in the works of most philosophers?perhaps just because of Collingwood's deep historical sense. 8. My impression that this is indeed a matter of strife is echoed in the following observa tion by the German poet Heine, quoted by Jung (in The Basic Works ofC. J. Jung (New York, The Modern Library, 1959), p. 183): Plato and Aristotle! these are not merely two systems: they are also types of two distinct human natures, which from time immemorial, under every sort of cloak, stand more or less inimically opposed. But pre-eminently the whole medieval period was riven by this conflict, persisting even to the present day; moreover, this battle is the most essential content of the history of the Christian Church. Though under different names, always and essentially it is of Plato and Aristotle that we speak. Enthusiastic, mystical, Platonic natures reveal Christian ideas and their corre sponding symbols from the bottomless depths of their souls.
