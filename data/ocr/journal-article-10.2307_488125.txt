<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Benjamin's Historicism by H.D. Kittsteiner "We want to eat bonbons and be banal." F. Hessel, Pariser Romanze Despite frequent claims to the contrary, the later Walter Benjamin can be thought of as a "historical materialist," even if only as a histori- cal materialist sui generis. He himself insists too resolutely on this title for it to be summarily refused him. His adversary in the field of his- toriography is said to be "historicism." The polemic against his- toricism dominates the sixth and seventh of the "Theses on the Philoso- phy of History" and culminates in the well-known demand that history be brushed against the grain. But since everything that is well-known (bekannt) is not for that reason necessarily understood (erkannt), such classifications bear reexamin- ing. The present essay undertakes such a reappraisal on the basis of the early drafts of the "Theses on the Philosophy of History" and a rather more cursory than thorough review of the Passagenwerk. As a non- professional reader of Benjamin I will nevertheless venture to suggest some terminological changes: out of a "historical materialist" will emerge a "materialist historicist" - not to Benjamin's disadvantage but merely to differentiate him clearly from Marx, for whom I would still like to reserve the title of a true historical materialist. This is not, admittedly, an auspicious time for confronting Marx and Benjamin: "It is not difficult, but does not lead very far, to show Benjamin his mis- understandings of Marxian theory."' I am of a different opinion; first of all, it is difficult, and secondly, it does lead far. Moreover, Marxian theory is today in the enviable position Benjamin had reserved for theology in the first thesis: it is small and ugly and has to keep out of sight. Since it is no longer modish, this might well be the time to recall the energies contained in obsolete things from which fashion has receded (II, 229). 1.

The God of Historicism In the notes and early drafts to the "Theses on the Philosophy of His- tory," Benjamin undertakes an organized campaign against his- toricism: a "first strike" is directed against the "idea of universal history"; then follows a counter-offensive, a theoretical construction which "explodes" and "liquidates" the "epic moment"; there re- mains, finally, the "third bastion of historicism,', the strongest and most difficult to name: "It presents itself as 'empathy' for the victor" (I, 1240f.). The fronts seem clear: "Articulating the past historically does not mean recognizing it'the way it really was.' It means seizing hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger" (I, 695). Ranke's alleged modesty - "History has often been assigned the task ofjudg- ing the past so as to teach one's contemporaries for the benefit of future years. The present work makes no such exalted claims; it wants only to show how things actually were (wie es eigentlich gewesen)"2 - was directed against a certain politicization of historical research. Benjamin seems to want to restore historiography to this political function, albeit with quite a different theoretical armature. This straightforward opposition is blurred by a remark from the early drafts in which both historicism and Ranke rise up again unvan- guished amidst instructions about how history ought to be written: "Witiko and Salammb6 represent their epochs as self-enclosed, 'im- mediate before God' ('unmittelbar zu Gott')." Just as these novels explode the temporal continuum, historiography ought to be able to follow suit" (I, 1244). To be sure, this is only a fragment from a Ranke citation; yet it is pre- cisely the idea of "blasting out" a particular era out of the "homoge- neous course of history," the "monadological procedure" otherwise strictly opposed to "historicist universal history," that is here insistently linked to a central historicist premise. If we follow up this clue, we will naturally stumble on the fact that the "immediate before God" to which Benjamin refers also turns up in Ranke in the context of a critique of the idea of progress and the classical German philosophy of history. In his theoretical introduction to Epochen der neueren Geschichte, the lec- tures given before King Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1854 and first printed in 1888, Ranke is concerned with saving historical specificity: "Should one want to suppose, in opposition to the view offered here, that prog- ress resides in the higher potentiality of each age in the life of man, that each generation completely surpasses the preceding one, and that the 2.

Such, as it were, mediated generations would have no meaning in and of themselves; they would only have meaning as a stage preparing the way for the following generations and would not stand in an immediate relation to the divine. I maintain, however, that each era is immediate before God, and its worth does not at all depend on what follows from it, but on its own existence, its own self." And: "Since no time lies before it, the Godhead as I conceive it - if I may dare to say so - oversees the whole history of mankind and finds equal value every- where. The idea of the education of mankind has, certainly, some truth in it, but before God all generations of mankind possess equal rights; the historian must view things accordingly."4 It would be a mistake to interpret such a view of history only as a mild God's eye view untroubled by any human value-judgments; the God of historicism acquires a decisive function through the equal distance he preserves in the face of all events. In his Deutsche Geschichte Ranke says: "We might perhaps say that the periods of history succeed one another in such a way that what is impossible for any given period may come to pass in all of them together, so that the plenitude of spiritual life breathed into the human species by the Godhead might in the course of centuries come to light."5 History is the revelation of the divine idea, a premise Ranke shares, as C. Hinrichs has pointed out, with the the- ology of history common to the age of Goethe. It is significant, how- ever, that all historical formations can reflect back this divinity only in a partial, unfree manner: the God of historicism is neoplatonically con- ceived as one who always remains above and beyond the world while his various gradations from the nus to the material are at work in the world. The idea does not, in Ranke, work itself out through the histori- cal formations, as it does in Hegel, in order finally to come into its own: "It is, as Plotinus would say, the only source that has no further origin and yet it gives one to all rivers without being exhausted by them, always remaining serenely the same. This is the decisive point: the idea in Ranke contains no immanent dialectical principle according to which it must develop in the phenomenal world, but rather emanates, even as it remains the one extra-worldly, immutable being, in a flux of appearances. As partial appearances, these bear the character of diver- sity and multiplicity, but at the same time each one contains within 3.

For it is only in the middle of the 19th century, almost simultaneously with historical materialism, that historicism takes root. Historicism and historical materialism are the two opposed approaches to history produced by the collapse of the philosophy of history. The crisis of the philosophy of history at mid-century is - if we leave aside the left Hegelian critique between 1815 and 1848 (im Vormiirz) - well- expressed by Rudolf Haym in Hegel und seine Zeit (1857): "Idealism, once thought to be all-powerful, had shown itself to be powerless. We stood and still stand assailed by a sense of great disappointment. Without respect for victorious realities, confronted by the triumphant poverty of the counter-revolution, we have at the same time forfeited all belief in our once cherished ideals. As at a single stroke, a hiatus separates the views and feelings of the previous century from our own. The philosophy on which our German spiritualism finally leaned has not stood the test."'7 In 1854, Ranke alludes critically to Lessing as the forefather of the German philosophy of history, whose concept of revelation has far-reaching effects that extend from Herder, Goethe, the Romantics, Schleiermacher, Hegel and Schelling to his own teacher, de Wette. His statement that the idea of the education of humankind surely has some truth to it shows that he doesn't want to reject it out of hand; it is, however, undeniable that the idea of the equal rights of all generations before God remains at odds with the idea of evolutionary development.8 The problem is not itself a new one: in the third sen- tence of his "Idee zu einer allgemeinen Geschichte in weltbiirgerlicher Absicht," Kant had already suggested that it would be strange to think that prior generations had only toiled away for the sake of their suc- cessors without being able to participate in the happiness they them- selves prepared. "But however mysterious this might be, it is at the same time also necessary"9: that the historico-philosophical designs a 6. Hinrichs, ibid., p. 164. 7.

On the relation of a "progressive" history to the individual life Kant writes: "In this connection it is strange that older generations appear to toil away only for the sake of succeeding ones, in order namely to prepare the way for the latter to build to a higher stage the edifice that nature intended; - and that only the most recent ones should enjoy the good fortune of inhabiting the building on which a long succession of</page><page sequence="5">H.D. Kittsteiner 183 teleologically conceived nature has on the human species still drown out any incipient doubts. If the idea of a development of the human species throughout his- tory is momentarily dropped, this crux of any philosophy of history is not slow to appear. It was someone other than Ranke who drew the consequences more precisely than he did; I refer to Hermann Lotze. Once again in the context of Lessing's "Education of the Human Species," education is, according to Lotze, clearly available to every- one. It is not supposed to be so clear, however, that "education should be thought of as distributed over the succession of human genera- tions." Its elaboration of this objection reads like an answer to Kant written after seventy years experience of bourgeois society: "Education is understandable to us only where it concerns the individual, where it is always one and the same person who becomes better, who bears the burden of his mistakes, enjoys the fruit of his atonement, and at least preserves in his memory, as an experience of happiness he has himself known, the good he once possessed, even if it had to be sacrificed to the progress of civilization .... The humanity, on the other hand, which is generally opposed to the individual, is nothing but the general idea of humanity; but this idea, which can neither do nor suffer nor ex- perience anything nor be the object of any development whatsoever, is the bearer of history."10 If one reverses this statement - it is not the their ancestors had worked (albeit unintentionally) without themselves being able to partake of the happiness they prepared" (Kant, Akademie-Ausgabe, Vol. VIII, p. 20). In "Science as a Calling" Max Weber takes up the problem of the separation between linear historical time and cyclical life time since the 18th century with reference to Tolstoy: "Abraham or some other peasant of ancient times died 'after a full life' (alt und lebensgesiittigt) because he was part of an organic circle of life, because in the evening of his days his life had essentially fulfilled what it had to offer, because no riddle that he wanted to solve now remained unanswered; consequently, he could have 'enough' of it. Modern civilization, on the other hand, continually enriches us with thoughts, knowledge, problems. Its members can become 'weary of life' but not fulfilled by it." Like the historical process, their lives could reach no end in terms of their intrinsic meaning (Weber, Gesammelte Aufsditze zur Wissenschaftslehre [Tiibingen, 1968] 3, p. 594). 10. Hermann Lotze, Mikrokosmus. Ideen zur Naturgeschichte und Geschichte der Mensch- heit, Vol. III (Leipzig, 1909) 5, p. 22 f. This critique - that only the individual is possessed of a unity of consciousness, not the human species, and that any notion of its "life course" is a mere fiction - is already formulated by Schopenhauer (Schopen- hauer, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, Siimtliche Werke, eds. J. Frauenstaidt, [Leipzig, 1922], Vol. 3, p. 505). Only in the second half of the century, however, does it gain significance. Lessing himself had weighed the possibility of palingenesis in order to meet objections of this kind: "Why should I not return as often as I am capable of obtaining new knowledge, new skills? Can I achieve so much at the first attempt that it would not be worthwhile to return?" (Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts, p. 98). On Herder's warning against the 'way of Averroism,' according to which mankind has only one soul and can only be educated as a whole, cf. W. Hiibener, "Leibniz - ein Geschichtsphilosoph?" in Studia leibnitiana, Sonderheft 10, p. 44.</page><page sequence="6">184 Walter Benjamin's Historicism idea of the development of the human being which is or was the bearer of history; rather, the actual course of history no longer sustains the idea of individual development - one sees what has taken place in the middle of the 19th century. In light of capitalist developments which had become a tangible experience in Germany by 1840/50, the ideal historico-philosophical pattern of the historical process fades away. The overheads of happiness exceed the promised returns; if one estimates the cost of the useful results of progress for the whole of life, "one might well wonder whether the greater mastery over nature on which we congratulate ourselves does not leave us even more dependent on that which we are constantly conquering."" The popular masses don't even share in this dubious gain; exposed to the "fluctuations of the world market," which they can neither survey nor resist, they alone bear the burdens and risks of this society.12 In such a situation, the idea of progress no longer yields anything for the idea of humanity; the generations would fall apart into an indif- ferent, disconnected mass if a new principle of coherence didn't con- nect them. Nothing would, according to Lotze, justify our bringing together generations that have historically remained alien to one another into a common "humanity" if a "miraculous vision" didn't strengthen us in the belief that there must be a higher order of things "in which the past is not simply not there but in which rather all the things the course of historical time irrevocably separates from one another exist side in a timeless community."'" The miraculous vision that prompts this belief is the observation that, despite all the selfishness of every present and all its ungrudgingness toward the future, a drive, more unconscious than conscious, impels humanity to work towards a better future.14 Once this idea has been established, the advantage it brings with it is 11. Lotze, ibid., p. 247. 12. Lotze, ibid., p. 275. 13. Lotze, ibid., p. 50. 14. Benjamin, who introduces the second of the "Theses on the Philosophy of His- tory" with this consideration, eliminates the accompanying orientation, still present in Lotze, towards a concept of progress. Lotze's concern is with the discrepancy between a "scientific" view of the course of history and an immediate feeling of life. What might be described as an injustice in relation to the whole - but in this case not as an injustice of the godhead, as in Ranke, but in the "division of the goods accumulated in a succes- sion of generations isolated one from another" - is not experienced as a misfortune in life itself. Despite this "general ungrudgingness of every present toward its future," a measure of "self-sacrificing labor for the sake of producing something better" links all ages. The idea of a "timeless community" is initially conceived only for those who helped produce these goods "without enjoying them" (Lotze, ibid., p. 49 f.) - This reference to the timeless community's participation in the future is bracketed by Ben- jamin. "Happiness which could arouse envy in us" (I, 693) is related to the present</page><page sequence="7">H.D. Kittsteiner 185 the notion of a mysterious bond that links past, present and future: "The premonition that we will not be lost for the future, that those who have come before us may well have departed from our earthly exist- ence but not from all reality, and that, in however mysterious a man- ner, the progress of history also takes place for them, this belief alone allows us to speak as we do of a humanity and its history."'5 Benjamin is aware of the ambivalence of Lotze's position: a strong historico-theological temptation - "rejection of the idea of progress in the religious view of history" - '6 is in the face of traditional historico-philosophical (geschichtsphilosophisch) stock that has not been gotten rid of turned into a "connexion of the idea of progress with that of the redemption";'" at the same time, a tendency is evident (as in Ranke) to think of the highest being no longer as a "substance" that develops as a "blind instinct," but rather as the one who lends co- herence to the multiplicity of the finite.'" The God that, with the his- toricization of all theodicies, has in the 18th century fallen into history is carefully escorted out again after the failure of his historical mission.'9 alone. "Life," which Lotze opposed with instinctive rightness to the scientific view of history, compresses historical time: "Our life is, in other words, a muscle that has enough strength to contract the whole of historical time" (V, 600). Only such "life time" is the object of happiness and redemption. 15. Lotze, ibid., p. 51. 16. The sentence Benjamin notes - "history could not through all its movements reach a goal that does not exist at its own level, and we would exhaust ourselves in our efforts to locate an overall progress which it is destined to make not over its whole tra- jectory but at every single point of its ascent" (V, 600) - occurs in Lotze in the context of considerations concerning the experimental character of progress. Only with the insight into its possible vanity does there emerge a tendency towards a theology of his- tory (Lotze, ibid., p. 48 f.) 17. With regard to Lotze and the degenerated concept of progress in the 19th cen- tury: "If the idea of progress through the entire course of history is characteristic of the satiated bourgeoisie, Lotze, for his part, announces the reservations of a class forced onto the defensive. Cf. by contrast H lderlin: 'I love the generation of the coming cen- turies' (V, 599). 18. Lotze, ibid., p. 580 f. 19. I consider the fall of God into history to be the flattening of the neoplatonic, vertically graduated chain of all being onto a temporal axis that marks progress and development: "The plenum formarum came to be conceived by some, not as the inventory but as the program of nature, which is being carried out gradually and exceedingly slowly in the cosmic history." (Arthur O. Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being [Cambridge, Mass., 1976] 13. p. 244). The mechanism of this immanent unfolding of all possibilities in time incorporates what was previously "evil" into itself as a motivat- ing force, now seemingly domesticated in the teleological packaging of moral philo- sophy. As it becomes clear over the course of the 19th century that the supposed "means" (the principle of competition still mostly conceived in anthropological categories) has not produced its "goal," but rather posits itself as the goal of historical movement, it becomes necessary to resurrect a God that transcends history.</page><page sequence="8">186 Walter Benjamin's Historicism Only when he no longer burdens himselfwith history can he guarantee the idea ofa "timeless community" and the ultimate "preservation and restoration" of all things.20 Benjamin refers explicitly to this motif in Lotze. For his own part, Benjamin, who knows no "periods of decline" (V, 575), outlines in a "small methodological proposal for a cultural- historical dialectic" a mechanism of negation whereby all that is futile, backward, and dead in a given era would gradually disclose its hidden meaning. "And so on into infinity until the entire past is restored to the present in a historical apocatastasis" (V, 573). With this notion of 'apocatastasis,' or what is called in rhapsodic pietistic treatises "the setting aright again of all that through Adam has fallen into sin, death, hell and eternal damnation," Benjamin seems far removed from historicism. And yet, if far less explicitly than Lotze, Ranke too cannot do without some notion of redemption. Before Origen, 'apocatastasis' referred to the recurrence of a specific planetary constellation; subsequently, with the stoics, to the return of the same world order in the rhythm of great cyclical movements of time. In the history of the apostles, 3.21, it means the fulfillment of the promises of the old covenant. Finally, with Origen it means the removal of all evil at the end of time and the complete restoration of creation to its original state. God's love takes back the fallen world into itself: "Tunc erit Deus omnia in omnibus." God's punishment is only a purifying fire; even Satan will return at the end of time to his creator so that "no more enemies remain."2' One must, I believe, ask with Ernst Benz why pre- cisely this teaching, which obeys the logic of the fall, was suppressed as heresy. "According to the Christian view of things, it is sin alone which destroyed this original harmony between man, God and the universe and made necessary God's intervention, i.e., the whole doctrine of salvation (.. .). Thus, one would expect that according to Christian eschatology divine history would culminate in the restoration of the beginning, i.e., in the renewal of the original image of God and the primordial sympathy of all things."22 20. The idea of humanity rests "in that real and living community ...which brings a temporarily discrete multiplicity of spirits together into a whole based on mutuality where each person's peculiar place is calculated and reserved in advance, as if all had been counted (. . .). Where the human heart strengthens its resolve by appeal- ing to the sprits of the ancestors or the palm of the future, it does so in this sense: every appeal to something non-existent is powerless; only that is powerful which is per- meated by the idea of such a preservation and restoration of all things" (Lotze, ibid., p. 51 f.; Benjamin, V, 600). 21.

Hinrichs' interpretation, the ground-plan of Ranke's world history displays just such a historico-philosophical schema. In order to represent the universal historical meaning of the figure of Jesus, Ranke refers to a memory from his student days in Leipzig which places his thought within the context of a Romantic mythology of history: humanity - symbolized by the figure of Prometheus in chains - is redeemed through Christ, the ancient pagan prototype of whom had been Hercules.23 "Prometheus, too, if we may put it thus, had to be released from his rock and humanity thrown back into its original state.""4 The origin of this gnostic interpretation of the Prom- ethean myth goes back to Plontinus: if Prometheus refuses to accept Pandora, this means that he prefers absolute spiritual being to earthly being. "The creator himself will also be enchained to the extent that he is himself bound to his creation, and such a chain comes from the exterior. And the freeing by Hercules means that he possesses a power which makes it possible for him to be redeemed."25 The surrender of historicism to history (Geschichtsverfallenheit) - this is all I meant to suggest - has a reverse historico-theological side. Pre- cisely because it reserves for itself a serenely undisturbed God beyond the multiplicity of historical events, it cannot imagine, should it allow itself such speculations, a redemption in history, but onlyfrom history. Ranke's watchword, "immediate before God," means not only the same proximity to the creator, but also the equal distance of all crea- tion from its origin. It confirms Lotze's notion of a "timeless com- munity" of generations. Where in the mid-nineteenth century the idea of progress begins to make a fool of itself, the historico-philosophical concept of humanity handed down from the Enlightenment is re- assembled and once again placed on historico-theological footing. Lotze, who explicitly takes up the idea of apocatastasis, is already close to Benjamin's idea of a "messianic world," conceived as a "world of all- sided and integral actuality." And this in turn functions as the redemp- tion of a true notion of "universal history" (I, 1238). Were these lines to be developed further, with much more precision than our present purposes allow, one would perhaps come to the con- clusion that Benjamin stood closer to historicism - via the function of God in its critique of the philosophy of history - than he himself thought. The attacks against historicism in the "Theses on the Philos- ophy of History" could well turn out to be a sideshow; the critique of 23. Hinrichs, op. cit., pp. 186 f. and 253; cf.

The Unconscious in History. Dialectical Image, Understanding and Deci- phering "Good formulation from Bloch for the Passagenarbeit: history shows its hallmark (Marke) from Scotland Yard. That was in the course of a conversation in which I discussed how this work - comparable in its method to that of atomic fission, which liberates the enormous powers that hold the atom together - is intended to liberate the enormous powers of history that are lulled to sleep in the "once upon a time" of classical historical story-telling. The urge to exhibit history, the thing itself 'as it actually was' was the strongest drug of the 19th century" (V, 1033). Even if the God of historicism and Benjamin's conception of a messianic universal history resemble each other to the extent that they make common cause against the idealist philosophy of history and its materialist offshoots, the comparison of history as a drug with the - today not unproblematic - image of atomic fission shows, conversely, that Benjamin proposed to make a quite different use than historicism of the enchained powers of the past. Nevertheless, I want to persist somewhat obstinately in considering Benjamin's thought in the con- text of certain historicist motifs. The theoretical enormity in Ranke's dictum that all generations have equal rights before God lies in the succeeding clause: "the historian must see things accordingly." What might work for God's view of his- tory, since in him "verum" and "factum" coincide,26 does not work quite so easily for the historian's view, and Ranke himself know as much.27 This methodological postulate remains important, however, 26. Cf. also Karl Ldwith's Vicos Grundsatz: verum etfactum convertuntur: Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften, Phil- hist. Klasse, 1 (1968), p. 8. 27. Alongside practical considerations ("One sees how infinitely difficult universal history becomes. What an infinite mass! How many differing endeavors! [... .] I con- sider it impossible to accomplish this task completely. God alone knows world his- tory!" [Ranke, Vorlesungseinleitungen, ed. V. Dotterweich/W.P. Fuchs (Munich/Vienna, 1975), p. 83]), Ranke is concerned with how the main ideas of history can be intuited. By deciphering these "sacred hieroglyphs," he performs a "divine service" (Gottes- dienst) in the proper sense (L.V. Ranke: Zureigenen Lebensgeschichte [Leipzig, 1890], p. 89). In contrast to discursive understanding, "intuitive understanding" carries only negative con- notations in Kant (Kant, Kritikder Urtheilskraft, AA Vol. V, p. 406 ff. (77). It comes into its own in the realm of historical knowledge because it promises to drown out the powerlessness of the observer in the face of a world he did not make. "The collusion of the universe" (Die Mitwisserschaft des Alls) is for Ranke, significantly enough, the ultimate result of historical research. Ranke, Tagebiicher, op. cit., p. 240. On Ranke's ambivalent position, cf. also H. Schnidelbach, Geschichtsphilosophie nach Hegel. Die Probleme des His-</page><page sequence="11">H.D. Kittsteiner 189 because it points to the connection between the acting and the know- ing subject of history. This idea of the identity of subject and object was to become a premise of the historicist version of understanding: "the first condition for the possibility of a science of history lies in the fact that I am myself a historical being and that the one who researches his- tory is also the one who makes history."28 The difficulties with this equation may be expected from the "making" of history; for the moment, however, they let us focus on the problems of "research- ing" it. "The Copernican turn in considering history is this: 'what happened' in the past was taken to be the fixed point and the present was seen as a groping effort to lead knowledge to this solid ground. Now this rela- tionship is to be turned around and what happened is to be subjected to a dialectical reversal and the intervention of an awakened conscious- ness" (V, 490 f.). Had this aphorism not already come to be almost mindlessly cited, it would be not at all apparent at first glance what the idea of an "awakened consciousness" is supposed to have to do with that "Copernican revolution," or why Benjamin can conclude: "The following is an experiment in the technique of awakening. An attempt to realize the dialectical, the Copernican turn of memory" (V, 490). If at first one only takes the formal, methodological side of this reversal - " 'What happened' in the past was taken to be the fixed point and the present was seen as a groping effort to lead knowledge to this solid ground" - this sentence reads like a summary from Karl Heussi's The Crisis of Historicism (1932), a book that does not so much develop theories of its own as summarize the experiences acquired with his- toricism since the beginning of the century. It discusses problems that arose in response to neokantianism which tended to dissolve every- thing "given" into an act of the perceiving consciousness.29 torismus, (Freiburg/Miinchen, 1974), p. 47: "Though Ranke distinguishes methodo- logically and in principle between God's immediate and man's discursive, inductive perspective on history, and limits scientific historiography to the latter, the divine vision nevertheless provides the basis for his understanding of world history." 28. Wilhelm Dilthey, Der Aufbau dergeschichtlichen Welt in den Geisteswissenschaften, ed. Manfred Riedel (Frankfurt, 1970), p. 347. The intervention of the "objective spirit," which is itself to be understood in turn only as the totality of forms in which the existing commonalities among individuals have objectified themselves in the sensorial world, also does not make much difference in this respect: "Its realm extends from styles of life, the forms of interaction society has developed in order to harmonize its goals, to custom, law, the state, religion, art, science and philosophy... Every place where trees have been planted, every room in which seats are arranged is understandable to us from childhood on because the human goals, arrangements, determinations of value have all assigned a place to every area and object in the room" (ibid., p. 256 f.) 29.

"As soon as the historian poses his 'theme,' the relevant moments come together in his mind and his conscious work is merely a matter of qualifying or critically validating the emerging historical complex with appropriate sensitivity or tact." Now this unconsciously appearing image is not a "treatment" of the supposed object, but is conceived as something "new" in relation to past events."5 In contradistinction to Ernst Bertram and Theodor Lessing, Heussi simply insists - with the censorious air objects are not'given' to consciousness as ready-made, fixed and naked in themselves, but that the relation of our imagination to the object presupposes an independent and spontaneous act of consciousness."

As far as the "unconscious pre-givens of historical thought" are concerned (ibid., p. 53, note 1), Heussi relies throughout on Scheler, who, borrowing in turn from William Stern, argues that a historical object is not constituted through the relation of generally valid values to preexistent facts. "A historical state of affairs constitutes itself through the rays of memory that fall upon it and in the coincidence of their intentions; 'sources' and mediate 'monuments' represent only the objective bearers of a symbolic function - the possibility of being remembered" (Max Scheler, Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens [Munich and Leipzig, 1924], p. 117, note.) 35.

The petrified rigidity of the past is valid only as an abstraction of the natural sciences, not for history."37 Above all, however, Heussi points to Max Scheler, who in Reue und Wiedergeburt in 1921 had already reflected on the possibility of shaking off the "determining power" of the past by an "operative intervention into the past of our lives": "The historical facts are incomplete and, as it were, redeemable. Certainly everything pertaining to the natural events that occurrred at the time of Caesar's death is as immutable as the solar eclipse predicted by Thales. But the'historical facts' - in other words, their effective unity in the web of human meaning and history - have an incomplete existence which can be completed only at the end of world history."S8 In his Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens (1924), Scheler expresses his satisfaction that in the meantime this idea has been taken over by E. Troeltsch, E. Spranger, Th. Litt, K. Mannheim, W. Stern and N. Hartmann.s9 Finally, Heussi recalls that the notion of a "fluid past" was already to be found in Nietzsche: "Historia abscondita - every great human being has a retroactive power: for his sake, all his- tory is again placed on the scales, and a thousand secrets of the past crawl out of their hiding-places - into his sun.

Scheler, who had in 1916 already prophesied a purifying ritual of penitence (Krieg und Aufbau [Leipzig, 1916], p. 20), could at the same time still write a preface to the second edition of his work Der Genius des Krieges und der deutsche Krieg by celebrating the war as "an almost metaphysical awakening from the dull state of a leaden sleep" (Ibid., [Leipzig, 1917], p. 4). His own reflections on the incompletion (Unabgeschlossenheit) of the past begin with the "incompleteness of its values" (Vom Ewigen im Menschen, p. 14); the subsequent re-evaluation of an event contributes to the completion of its meaning and is accomplished through "remembering." Memory interrupts the flow of causality and brings it to a halt (Ibid., p. 16). In the case of Scheler, who comes very close to "undoing," this much at least is clear: whoever promises to redeem a past himself seeks redemption from the burden of his continual guilt. 39.

The past is perhaps still essentially undiscovered! So many retroactive powers are still needed!"40 Behind all this lies Schlegel's dictum of the historian as backwards- turned prophet. Let us for the moment break off this excursion into the crisis of his- toricism and summarize its tendencies: the firmly held belief in a sta- ble historical object is fading, the conscious value relation is pushed aside by the unconsciously occurring image, the historian is granted retroactive powers, the past becomes plastic and accessible to "re- demption." All these motifs are easily rediscovered in Benjamin: "It is not the case that the past throws its light on the present or the present its light on the past; rather, the image occurs where the past comes together with the present to form a constellation .... These images come, as is well-known, involuntarily. History in the strict sense is thus an image from involuntary memory, one that appears suddenly to the subject of history at a moment of danger" (I, 1242f.). At the same time, Benjamin's thought clearly should not be reduced to its lowest common denominator by demonstrating such parallels. An outside perspective on his writings may, however, outline certain general problems that would otherwise remain concealed by an all- too-narrow reconstruction, if only because such problems can no longer be perceived if one merely reproduces his language. If we take up again the motif of the unconsciously occurring histori- cal image, which occupies the position of the value relation in the neokantian system, it becomes clear that the incorporation of the "un- conscious" into the historian's method presupposes the recognition of an "unconscious" in the actual historical process. A grandiloquent "will to make history" still lurks behind the Weberian value relation: "The transcendental precondition of a science of culture is not that we somehow find value in a particular culture or indeed in any culture, but that we are cultural beings endowed with the ability and will to take a conscious position toward the world and lend it meaning."41 The violence of such conscious self-assertion has fallen into a crisis. To borrow an allusion of Heussi (or rather of Scheler) to Klages, Frobenius, Spengler and Th. Lessing: 'homo faber' has proven to be a'faux pas of life.'42 The dark other of the value relation which Weber also sensed ("Endlessly the stream of immeasurable activity rolls towards eter- 40.

The crisis of historicism is far more than a "crisis of historical thinking in the years following the World War";44 it marks history's disruption of the protective cultural values of the Wilhelminian juste-milieu. "The story history tells is in fact only the long, heavy and confused dream of humanity"; Schopenhauer's curse45 appears at the turn of the century to have achieved its fulfillment. If, however, history is a "dream" - to take up this idea for a moment - then it is not attributable to any consciously acting subject; rather, it would be "unconsciously" produced and it would seem only proper that the historian adjust his method to remain adequate to his object. Benjamin clearly did not shirk this problem. He wants to deal with the problem of "awakening from the nineteenth century"; the historian is assigned the task of interpreting dreams (V, 580). This task would be comparable to the collaboration between analysand and analyst in extracting a dream's latent content, by a process of association and interpretation, from the manifest material that has been distorted by the dreamwork, in order to get at both the repressed and the proc- ess of repression. Before we take even one step further in this direction, however, we must first make sure that we are not falling victim to an equivocation. Evidently we are faced here with a twofold "unconscious": 1) a histori- cal unconscious that comes out in the experience that "history" as a total process cannot be consciously made, and 2) the "unconscious" of psychoanalysis, composed of repressed instinctual representations, an arsenal of fantasies, images and wishes. Now the really difficult task, the solution to which it is not my intention here even to consider, would be to relate these two ideas of the "unconscious" to each other and thus to ask what that inability to produce history has to do with this development of the unconscious as a partial aspect of the ego. For our present purposes, this distinction will serve more modest ends: it is merely intended to prevent us from surrendering unconditionally to an interpretation of history that operates with psychoanalytic ter- minology. Benjamin himself knew more work still needed to be done on arguments "concerning the collective unconscious and its imagin- ings" (V, 1157); his repeated requests that the institute give him urgent 43.

This somewhat aphoristic aside catches the intention of Schopenhauer's philosophy better than the chapter on history in general, in which history is after much polemics again assigned the status of a "serene consciousness of humankind" (ibid., p. 509).</page><page sequence="16">194 Walter Benjamin's Historicism support with these problems indicate as much (letter to Horkheimer of 3.28.1937; letter to Adorno of 5.17.1937; cf. also the letters to Scholem of 7.2.1937 and to Fritz Lieb of 7.9.1937). The idea that history is "unconscious production" is something that German philosophers of history were already clear about from Kant to Hegel; but they had at their disposal only rudimentary insights into the structure of this hidden center of historical movement.46 It was all the easier to superimpose on this largely unknown ground of history a teleology grounded in moral philosophy, and thus to construct an alien subject operating beyond our sphere of action, while at the same time guiding our interest in history and society towards a rational end. Schelling terms this relationship between freedom and necessity the "highest as yet unresolved problem of transcendental philosophy." In our freedom of action a hidden necessity is at work which must be explained in a new and different manner than "providence or fate."47 Schelling sees very clearly, as does Kant,48 that this problem can only arise out of the absence from all historical activity of a free will capable of forging history; this lack, in turn, is inherent in the structure of bourgeois society: "The success of my actions, then, does not derive from me but depends rather on the will of all the others, and I can accomplish nothing towards that goal if everyone does not want the same goal."49 Since, however, such a volontigbnerale is lacking, history is like nature to me: it happens to me as something that "arises for me 46. A philosophy of history that rests on the "philosophy of law" can inevitably have no way of understanding the dynamic of "bourgeois society." This is not the case for Anglo-Saxon "theoretical history." Emerging contemporaneously with German Idealist philosophy of history, it is already based on the categories of a "political economy." Cf. also H.D. Kittsteiner, Naturabsicht und Unsichtbare Hand. Zur Kritik des geschichtsphilosophischen Denkens (Frankfurt, Berlin, Vienna, 1980), p. 207 ff. 47. In this context, Schelling calls "unconscious" what happens to me "without my doing anything" in the execution of my free action; he describes men's historical action as a relation "by virtue of which, through their free action, and yet against their will, (they) become the cause of something they never wanted or, conversely, by virtue of which something must fail or come to harm which they freely wanted and exerted all their powers to achieve" (Schelling, System des transcendentalen Idealismus, Werke, ed. M. Schr6ter [Munich, 19271 ff., III, 594). 48. Kant discusses the problem of the power of human action to shape history in connection with the question of progress. Only from providence can one, according to Kant, expect a successful result "that extends to the whole and from there to the parts, since men, for their part, set out in their designs.., only from the parts, and can extend only their ideas, not their influence to the whole as such, which is too great for them - above all because their designs contradict one another and would only with difficulty freely achieve unity among one another" (Kant, On the saying: "That may be true in theory, but not in practice," AA, Vol. VIII, p. 310). 49.

Kittsteiner 195 unintentionally.""5 An escape from this dilemma is offered by the Absolute as the ground of identity between "absolute subject and absolute object, consciousness and consciouslessness."5' Yet this solu- tion, together with its subsequent historico-philosophical develop- ments, is not a durable one. On the basis of our earlier section on the "God of historicism," we might observe with reference to the 19th cen- tury that the unconscious production of history could be admired as the "cunning of reason" only as long as God was conceived as his- torically immanent. That the historian was unable to explain all occur- rences "from the minds of the actors" was acceptable as long as a merciful God presided over events.52 The unconscious production of history becomes precarious as soon as the true God of history one day announces his presence by shoving his colleagues down from the altar.53 It is under this open sky of capitalist modernity that Benjamin takes up the question of the unconscious. "Capitalism was a natural phe- nomenon which brought a new dream sleep, and therewith a reactiva- tion of mythical forces over Europe" (V, 494). We will attempt an interpretation of this statement after first demonstrating in a particular case how Benjamin's line of inquiry leads him to operate with Marx- ian categories. It may well seem characteristic that at the very moment when he is beginning to "look around in the first volume of Capital" he is also relaxing from this "nightmare" in the "dwarf garden" of Egon Friedell's cultural history (V, 1122). He by no means wanted to subscribe to a 50. Ibid., p. 596. 51. Only if an "unconscious lawfulness" can be assumed in and through all arbit- ratiness can goals be conceived in history (III, 597). A higher third dimension must be constituted beyond unconscious, objective laws and conscious, self-determining free- dom, not as an "object of knowledge, but only of the eternal precondition for action, i.e., of belieP' (ibid., III, 598 ff.). E.v. Hartmann takes up this passage of Schelling's and attempts to psychologize it. God's will is my unconscious will. "If, however, we cannot do without an unconscious will beside our conscious will, and if we also add to this the well-known phenomenon of unconscious clairvoyance, why still introduce a tran- scendent God when the individual as we know him is capable of coping on his own?" (E.v. Hartmann, Philosophie des Unbewussten [Leipzig, 1904; 1st ed., 1868], Teil 1, p. 343). 52. Ranke, Tagebi2cher, op. cit., p. 234. 53. The painless revolution of the true, the good and the beautiful in Diderot (Rameaus Neffe, Das erziihlerische Werk, ed. M.

Hoffmeister, [Hamburg, 1952] 6, p. 388) and finally the supremacy of the colonial trading system in Marx. "It was 'the alien God' who placed himself on the altar alongside the old gods of Europe and then one day shoved down the whole lot. It pro- claimed surplus production as the final and only goal of mankind" (Marx, Das Kapital, Vol. 1 [MEW 23], p. 78).</page><page sequence="18">196 Walter Benjamin's Historicism Marxist understanding of history at the price of its sensory concrete- ness (V, 575). The way his thought wanders between the most abstract and the most concrete levels may be documented as follows. When in Karl Korsch's book on Marx (V, 1333) Benjamin comes across the expression, "The hidden place of production, at the threshold of which we read: 'Authorized personnel only,' " he associates this with Dante's inscription on the gate of hell as well as an unspecified place in his "Einbahnstrasse" (V, 813). If we check it, we find to our surprise a meditation on the appearance of bank notes: "A descriptive analysis of bank notes ought to be done. A book whose immense satirical power would be matched only by its matter-of-factness. For nowhere more than in these documents does capitalism display its naive solemnity. The innocent young things disporting themselves around numbers, goddesses holding tablets of the law and mature heroes of various denominations of coins placing their swords in their scabbards - this is a whole world unto itself: the architectural fagade of hell" (IV, 139). Marx's theoretical advance - the step from the "noisy" sphere of cir- culation "housed at the surface" to the "hidden scene of production"54 - is transposed into a topographical descent into the underworld. This much is metaphorically implicit in Marx himself, but not the association - and here we find an echo of the 1928 text, which only now receives theoretical specification - that even the bank note itself, the means of circulation, bears the undisguised, yet initially illegible, imprint of its function (that of a self-validating value exchanged for labor-power), which it is destined to accompany into the underworld of production: as the "architectural facade of hell." The aesthetics of the bank-note is a grotesque confirmation of what Benjamin describes as "phantasmagoria." "The property attributable to the fetishized character of the com- modity derives from the commodity-producing society itself - not, certainly, as it is in itself, but rather as it constantly imagines and understands itself to be when it abstracts from the fact that it produces commodities. The image it produces of itself and is accustomed to entitle its culture corresponds to the notion of phantasmagoria" (V, 822). Phantasmagorias are unconsciously produced. Herein lies Ben- jamin's real interest. Capitalism, which came over Europe as a"natural phenomenon," brought about a "dream-sleep." Benjamin was of course familiar with the Marxian theory of "natural conditions" (Natur- wiichsigkeit).55 His primary concern, however, was not with the problem 54. Marx, Das Kapital, Vol. 1 (MEW 23), p. 189. 55. The excerpt (V, 605) shows that he read the section entitled "Nature and Socie- ty" in Korsch's manuscript, where the concept of "natural conditions" (das Natur-</page><page sequence="19">H.D.

It is in fact a law of nature that rests on the unconsciousness of those involved";56 Benjamin is pre-eminently concerned with the "un- consciousness" of those involved. "Didn't Marx teach" - he already writes in the first notes of the Passagenarbeit - "that the bourgeoisie can never achieve a wholly enlightened consciousness of itself as class? And isn't onejustified, in this case, in adding to his thesis the idea of a collective dream (a dream, that is, of the bourgeois collective)?" Ben- jamin immediately appends an afterthought: "Moreover, wouldn't it be possible to demonstrate how all the states of affairs with which this work is concerned are illuminated in the process whereby the pro- letariat achieves self-awareness?" (V, 1033). This second step - which was from the outset implicit in the Passagenarbeit as a theory intended to replace failing conceptions and organizations of that class-consciousness expected to develop on the basis of conscious insight - should not be lost sight of,57 whether one is inclined to welcome or regret it. Benjamin evidently assumes that the "awakening from the dream" which he constantly evokes as the "dialec- tical method of historiography" (V, 1006), can practice itself on the phantasmagoric objects left behind by a preceding bourgeois era in the unconscious reproduction of its life. What is true at the individual and biographical level for the resolution of youthful experiences,58 is also to apply to the interplay of whole eras: "The nineteenth century, to wikchsige) is explicitly described by Marx - against the Romantics - in its negative aspects (Karl Korsch, Karl Marx, ed. G. Langkau [Frankfurt, 1969] 2, p. 136). 56. Marx, Das Kapital, op. cit., p. 89, note 28. 57. Benjamin, who expresses his regret in a letter to Fritz Lieb in 1937 that the government of Leon Blum had succeeded in "robbing the working-class of the gut basis of instinctive action, the unerring sense for when and under what circumstances a legal action must pass over into an illegal one, an illegal action into a violent one" (Chryssoula Kambas, Wider den 'Geist der Zeit.' Die antifaschistische Politik Fritz Liebs und Walter Benjamins, in Der Fiirst dieser Welt, ed.J. Taubes [Fink/Schaningh, 1983], p. 281), seems to have pursued a theory of class consciousness which refuses the alternative opened up by Lukics, according to which the proletariat must either replace "the emptied and bursting shells" of the bourgeoisie with positive alternatives or else ideologically submit to "these utterly empty and hollow forms of bourgeois culture" (Georg Lukics, Geschichte und Klassenbewusstsein [Berlin, 1923], p. 228). Indeed, if one takes all the notes together (V, 1033), it becomes apparent that he considered the possibility that the "coming to consciousness" of the proletariat might be uncon- sciously accomplished, namely as the decoding of its own wishes from the phantas- magorias of the dreaming bourgeois collective. 58.

He ponders the ques- tion of whether one might not assume the existence of repressed economic contents in the consciousness of a collective "similar" to those maintained by Freud "for the sexual contents of an individual consciousness" (V, 669). These experiences, which are said to have "their repository in the unconscious of the collective" (V, 47; V, 508) impress themselves upon things and function in the minds of their recipients as "dream elements on awakening" (V, 59; 580). If one con- siders "phantasms" as libidinal representations that have been rejected by the system of culture and forced into the unconscious, where they do not, however, disappear but rather continue to press for the fulfill- ment of their wishes,59 then once this "societal unconscious" had, so to speak, gone through the stages of the dreamwork, it would, according to Benjamin, enter the use-value of capitalist commodities, where it would develop its subversive power to threaten social stability. (If, on the other hand, one assumes the existence of a death-instinct and its secondary forms, which could manifest themselves in a similar way, Adorno needn't have had to worry in his letter of 8.2.1935 that Ben- jamin was reacting only to the Saint-Simonian conception of the com- modity world as utopia and losing sight of the circles of hell [V, 1128]). The further one were to pursue this question, piling citation upon citation, the more likely one would be to find oneself confronted by the above-mentioned problem of the connection between a historical and an individual - or rather collective-unconscious. What distinguishes Benjamin is that he sees a connection between Marx's notion of "natural conditions" and "dream-sleep," but he finds no theoretical resolution of this complex. One can only observe that it is precisely at this point that he turns away from the economic structure of capitalist society toward the conscious or rather the unconscious producer caught up in this society. Horkheimer told him as much in writing: "you introduce the economic dimension not so much as the total process of produc- tion and its tendencies but in certain particulars" (V, 1143). Whether or not this neglect of the social totality is frought with consequences will be our concern in the final section. First, however, let us give some indication - lest Benjamin might after all be thought, as a result of such neglect, to have lost the title of a "historical materialist" - how our original claim that he is indeed a "materialist historian" is to be grounded. For historicism did not skirt the phenomenon of capitalism 59. Mario Erdheim, Die gesellschaftliche Produktion von Unbewusstheit.

Kittsteiner 199 undamaged on its way into Lebensphilosophie and from there into certain aspects of "critical theory"; it was forced to modify its concept of understanding and had to give up those premises of its notion of his- tory that derived from identity philosophy. A brief montage may serve to document this claim. "All understanding," says Humboldt, "presupposes, as the condi- tion of its possibility, that an analogy to what is subsequently under- stood, a pre-existing originary accord between subject and object, is already present in the comprehending subject."60 Historical objects, events, forms, and institutions are objectifications of a spirit that brings together historical producers and recipients into an intelligible unity. "Only what the human mind and hand have forged, fashioned, and touched, only the human trace lights up again before us. Fashioning, forging, ordering, humanity expresses its individual essence, its self- hood, in every utterance. Whatever is somehow, somewhere still acces- sible to us from such expressions and traces speaks, is intelligible to us."''61 History is forJ.G. Droysen that of the "human signature," the history of "human form-giving." "It is a question of tracing these expressions back to what sought to be expressed in them. What mat- ters is that we understand them."62 Similarly, the humanities are for Dilthey based on the connexions between "life, expression and under- standing."63 "The objectifications of life" occupy the place previously occupied by the "objective spirit": "To the extent that life in its totality - experience, understanding, the coherence of historical existence, the power of the irrational in it - takes the place of Hegel's universal reason, the problem arises as to how history is possible."''64 Now it is debatable whether "life" is an adequate replacement for Hegel's "reason" in history. The structural element of the truly "alien" is missing, as is the movement "behind the back" of the individual that was characteristic of all philosophies of history and inherited by the Marx- ian concept of capital. Acknowledging the power of the "irrational" within the context of "life" means taking up his problem in abbrevi- ated anthropomorphic form. Lebensphilosophie does not escape such anthropomorphism even if - as in Simmel - it registers the disturb- ance of those objectifications: "The excessive specialization which is 60. Wilhelm v.

As a result, they deviate from the direction in which they might accom- modate themselves to the personal development of the human soul." Simmel emphasizes that he is concerned with "products of human cul- ture"; the tragedy of culture as he sees it is that these destructive powers which are directed against a particular being themselves arise out of the deepest layers of that selfsame being.""65 Simmel's essay volume ap- peared in 1911. In the Theory of the Novel, Georg Lukics registers the alienation between "human beings and their images" as an accom- plished fact, no longer only a "deviation." The act of understanding - "as if soul delves into soul," in Droysen's formulation66 - fails in the face of the hardness of the world of things. "When the soul of objects can no longer become immediate to the soul, when they no longer appear as a damming up of inwardness that can be at any moment transformed back into soul, they necessarily acquire a blind, indis- criminate power that inescapably rules over us without exception in order to perpetuate its existence.''67 In his lecture on the "Idea of Natural History" (1932), Adorno takes up the Lukaicsian idea of the "second nature" of human creations. This nature "is a congealed, alien complex of meaning that no longer awakens inwardness; it is a boneyard (Schiidelstiitte) of decayed inwardness and could for that reason only be aroused - if this were at all possible - by the metaphysical act of a reawakening of the soul that created or maintained it in its earlier or intended existence; it could never again be experienced by another inwardness."68 The demand for a reawaken- ing of what is dead and frozen replaces an erstwhile empathy (Ein- flihlung) with structures which can now no longer simply be described as expressions of "soul" (Seelisches). "From the perspective of the philos- ophy of history, the problem of natural history first poses itself as the question of how it is possible to known and interpret this dead, ali- enated, reified world." The task of"interpretation" is to be maintained. In the face of the capitalist world of objects, however, it has become that much more complicated. "Awakening" now replaces and outbids 65.

One has to deal with things "that cannot be deciphered but confront us as ciphers."'' At this point Adorno passes from Lukics to Benjamin: for LukAcs history as boneyard would remain something merely enigmatic; for Benjamin it becomes a "cipher that is to be read."'7 To read the language of things: this idea connects the allegorist of the Trauerspiel book with the motif of "awakening" in the Passagenwerk. "In order to understand the arcades from the ground up, we immerse them in the deepest dream layer, and speak of them as if they had happened to us" (V, 272). It is not without significance that the concept of understand- ing should re-emerge in this context. The "Copernican turn" liquefies the solidity of "what was." Benjamin emphasizes on a number of occasions that although the relationship of the present to the past is certainly a temporal one, that of the past to the present is that of a non- temporal order of images (V, 57 8). The "image," which flashes up like lightning from the past into the present, awakens the dreamer and itself becomes legible at this very moment (V, 580). To the extent that Benjamin in this way maintains the legibility of things, one may speak of him not altogether without justification as a "materialist historian." Following the collapse of its ideas of objectification" (Objektivation) and "sympathetic identification" (Einfiihlung), the doctrine of understand- ing accompanied by the categories of the unconscious, dream, and the 69. Ibid., p. 356. 70. Ibid., p. 360. The idea of history as "God's hieroglyph," which was current from Herder to the early Romantics and also has an impact on Ranke, recedes in Droysen and Dilthey behind the problem of grasping historical forms as the objec- tification of human labor. From the Hegelian perspective, the world spirit is practically reduced to the level of the spirits of the people. Along with this goes the fact that already in Droysen the movement of history as a whole is bracketed out of the realm of forms. These still remain essentially "understandable." History remains, to be sure, the developing self-awareness of mankind (Historik, op. cit., p. 357), but the researcher can only perceive the "direction of the flowing" (Ibid., p. 358). The life of "moral powers" enters a restless, quantitative movement - that of progress and "intensification" (Ibid., p. 29; 18 1). With the hardening of the world of things and the distortion of the "soul" objectified in it, history - which is in general given over in the 19th century to "progress" - once again comes to the fore, but now as a negative movement wholly in need of a "redemption." When Benjamin writes that the "dialectical method could not take effect within the ideology of progress but rather only in a conception of history that overcomes it in all its parts" (V, 495), early romantic motifs - refracted by the experience of capitalist commodity production - simultaneously emerge. "Every- thing we experience is a message. The whole world is a message, a revelation of the spirit. The time is'nio more when the spirit of God was understandable. The meaning of the world has been lost. We remain standing before the letter .... The meaning of the hieroglyph is missing" (Novalis, Siimtliche Werke, ed. E. Kammitzer [Munich, 1924], Vol. 4, p. 14).</page><page sequence="24">202 Walter Benjamin's Historicism awakening of the self (but also of the awakening of others and redemp- tion) here finds its last refuge in the face of capitalist commodity production. One question remains: are the objects and structures of capitalist society always such that they can be seen - if not as objectifications of the spirit - as phantasmagorias of a dreaming collective? If Marx and Benjamin were to carry on a dialogue among the dead, Benjamin would perhaps say: "There are things that dream." And why should Marx not retort, by contrast: "But there are also things that don't dream." This distinction should make it possible to tell the "historical materialist" and the "materialist historicist" apart. III. Capital, Dream, Awakening, Myth Benjamin did not misunderstand Marxian theory. Nor did he want merely to interpret it differently; he wanted to change it. In a letter to Scholem he says of the parallels between the Trauerspiel book and the Passagenwerk "that here to the articulation of a received concept will stand at the center. There it was the concept of the Trauerspiel, here it would be the fetish character of the commodity. If the baroque book mobilized its own theory of knowledge, this would be no less true of the Passagen" (V, 1112). In a letter to Adorno he expresses the hope that he will, a la longue, have a solid position in the Marxist debate, "if only because the decisive question of the historical image will here be fully developed for the first time" (V, 1118). Having said this much, let us now return to the subjective element in Benjamin's version of the fetish. What he is concerned with is the overlaying of the commodity's use-value with the fantasies and re- pressed contents of a dreaming collective (V, 669; 822). The com- modity thus formed is a "phantasmagoria," the distorted "expression" of which can nevertheless be read (V, 574). The concepts of the "fetish" and the "phantasmagoria" mark Benjamin's divergence from Marx. Since our primary concern here is not with Walter Benjamin as a reader of Karl Marx, but rather with confronting certain categories, we will restrict ourselves to the first edition of Capital, which was of course not available to Benjamin but nevertheless contains more interesting de- tails than the later versions. Fetishism there appears as the fourth peculiarity of the equivalent form: "The fetishism of the commodity form is more striking in the equivalent form than in the relative value form."" As is well-known, 71. Karl Marx, Das Kapital (1st edition, 1867), ed. Fred E. Schrader (Hildesheim, 1980), p. 773.</page><page sequence="25">H.D. Kittsteiner 203 what is at issue here is the notion that the "value" (Wertsein) of the com- modity is not its natural but rather its social quality, and that the famous 20 yards of linen are of no other use to the equally famous skirt, i.e. the equivalent form, than to impose on it this its social determina- tion: "It serves it only by representing its value as an object of exchange as distinct from its use-value as stiff linen."72 This determination, to be the linen's expression of value, seems to attach to it as a thing "even beyond the connection with linen."'" This, then, is why fetishism, a social relation among commodities that becomes a thing, is "more striking" in the equivalent form than in the relative value form. For the moment, however, we are concerned less with the question of the objective content of the analysis of value forms than with the well-known sentences in which Marx introduces and explains the con- cepts of "fetish" and "phantasmagoria." They read as follows: "It is only the specific social relations among human beings themselves which here assume for them the phantasmagoric form of a relation among things. In order, therefore, to find an analogy, we must flee to the nebulous realm of the religious world. Here theproducts of the human mind appear as though endowed with a life of their own, relating to one another and to human beings as independent forms. Thus in the world of commodities theproducts of the human hand. What I call fetishism is what clings to the products of labor as soon as they are produced as commodities and is then insepa- rable from commodity production.'"74 At first glance, it seems as though Marx is using the concept of the fetish in the sense of contemporary ethnology and the philosophy of religion, a sense in which it had been habitually used since Ch. de Brosses' bookDu Cultedes Dieux ftiches (1760).75 It is possible that Marx 72. Ibid., p. 19. 73. Ibid., p. 23. 74. Ibid., p. 774. 75. Ch. de Brosses speaks of the fetish as a word "forge par nos commergans du Senegal sur le mot Portugais Fetisso, c'est-a-dire, chosefee, enchantee, divine ou rendant des oracles; de la racine latine Fatum, Fanum, Fari. Ces Fetiches divins ne sont autre chose que le premier objet materiel qu'il plait a chaque nation ou ' chaque particulier de choisir &amp; de faire consacrer en c&amp;remonie par ses Pretres: c'est un arbre, une montagne, le mer, un morceau de bois, une queu de lion, un caillou .. ." (Ch. de Brosses, Du Culte des Dieux Fitiches. Parallkle de l'ancienne Riligion de l'Egypte avec la Riligion actuelle de Nigritie [1760; republished in 1972, Farnborough], p. 18 f.). Zedlers Universal-Lexikon ([Halle und Leipzig, 1735], Vol. 9, p. 675) still cites the word in its Portuguese spelling; Kant uses it in 1793 in a Germanized version as a description of catholic "clerics" (Pfaf- fenthum) (Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, AA, Vol. VI, p. 179); Ersch- Grubers "General Encyclopedia of the Arts and Sciences" distinguishes between higher and lower fetishism and takes offense above all at the idea that "works created by human hands" can become objects of veneration (Vol. 43 [Leipzig, 1846], p. 337 f.).</page><page sequence="26">204 Walter Benjamin's Historicism read de Brosses,76 but it might also be that he was familiar with the rele- vant passages in Hegel's work on the philosophy of religion. Hegel there devotes a rather lengthy section to the fetish. Magic appears as the simplest form of natural religion, one that arises out of the need to oppose the power of nature with a power of one's own. Magic can be practiced directly or indirectly; in its indirect form, man does interfere in the power struggle of things, but cunningly allows a thing to perform the magic on his behalf. To this end, however, he must confer power on it.77 "This is thefetish, a word which was first brought into circulation by the Portuguese and which stems from feitizo, magic. Here to be sure, in the fetish, independence seems to assert itself against the arbi- trariness of the individual, but since this very objectivity is merely the self-expression of individual arbitrariness, the latter also continues to be the master of its image. What they imagine to be their power is thus nothing objective, solid in itself, and separate from them. The fetish remains in their power; they throw it away when it fails to do their bid- ding. They thus make something other into a higher power, imagine it to be a power over them, and precisely thereby retain power over it after all."78 This last formulation already shows that Marx's concept of the fetish runs counter to its normal use. Commodities are, certainly, man- made; they do not, however, become fetishes as such, but rather through their objective relation to themselevs as exchange-values. The thing that materializes in this relation is money; it does not express a human intention, but the value of a social relation. Nor does it remain in our power, but, together with the commodity in the self-actualizing process of value creation, constitutes the forms of capital, the self- generating substance/subject of history.79 Marx's language already 76. Fred E. Schrader calls attention to an early German translation of de Brosses and points to a Marxian note from 1842 on the concept of the fetish (Fred E. Schrader, "Die Aufl6sung der 'Politischen Theologie' Hegels," in Der FiRrst dieser Welt, op. cit., p. 246, note 90). In the early writings, Marx uses the concept "servant of the fetish" to de- scribe the mercantilists from the perspective of classical national economy (Okonomisch- philosophische Manuskripte [MEW Ergi.nzungsband. Part One], p. 530). 77. "I is the magician; but it is through the thing itself that it conquers the thing" (G.W. F. Hegel, Vorlesungen iiber die Philosophie der Religion 1, Werke in zwanzig Biinden, ed. E. Moldenhauer/K.N. Michel [Frankfurt, 1969 ff.), Vol. 16, p. 288). 78. G.W.F. Hegel, Die Vernunftin der Geschichte, ed.J. Hoffmeister (Hamburg, 1955) 5, p. 222. 79. Marx, Das Kapital (MEW 23), op. cit., p. 169; in his ethnological excerpts Marx later notes down SirJohn Lubbock's concept of the fetish, but without relating it to his own use of the word in Capital: "Fetishism; where man thinks he can compel the Godhead (a Godhead always of an evil nature) in order to pursue his desires." And on idols: "Not to be confused with fetishes; fetishism is an attack on the Godhead, idolatry</page><page sequence="27">H.D. Kittsteiner 205 reveals that the concept of the fetish is not really adequate to the state of affairs it is supposed to ilustrate. Precisely because it was "nothing really objective, solid in itself," the fetish was for Hegel only an object in the hand of a subject. For Marx, by contrast, the fetish is not made, but makes itself in the movement of the things themselves. It becomes an active subject that "attaches to the products of labor as soon as they are produced as commodities."80"" A similarly objective turn may be observed in the concept of the "phantasmagoria." There is no question the word should not be trans- lated as "fantasy image," but rather as "phantom," one which has, to be sure, acquired a quite astonishing solidity. In order to make sure the sentence in which it occurs is properly understood, a small adjustment of the reading habits we usually bring to Marx is in order. "It is only the specific social relations among human beings themselves which here assume the phantasmagoric form of arelation among things." Guided by the early writings and their theory of "alienation," one is normally inclined to telescope "human beings" and "themselves" so that an actual human social relation always gets translated as an "alienated" or "reified" rela- tion through the relations of commodities to one another and the doubling of the commodity into commodity plus money. This exegesis proves upon further reflection to be incorrect. To be sure, producers still stand behind commodities; without them, they form no com- munity, however, but rather contribute to the total labor of the society only by means of their products. Behind the relation of the 20 yards of linen to the 1 skirt there is not yet another "human" relation; rather, their social relation is this relation of things and no other. "Reification" here means only that the reflex of this relation solidifies into a thing in the equivalent form of the commodity (K, 23, 33); it is to be separated completely from all 'life-philosophical' (lebensphilosophisch) versions of "reification" as "alienation."8' That it is a question here ofa re-ification an act of submission to it" (Karl Marx, Die ethnologischen Exzerpthefte, ed. Lawrence Krader [Frankfurt, 1976], p. 505 and 507). Against the background of these notes - if an analogy can be drawn here at all - "idolatry" would still seem to be the more accurate designation for what Marx wants to express in the chapter on fetishism. 80. In subsequent editions of Capital, Marx smoothed away the linguistic violence from the sentence that speaks of fetishism as something that "attaches itself to the prod- ucts of labor." The sentence now merely reads: "I call fetishism that which attaches to the products of labor .. ." (Kapital, Vol. 1 [MEW 23], p. 87; Kapital, I st edition, op. cit., p. 774). This hardly clarifies the issue. 81. It is no coincidence that Luk~ics' fateful sentence - "The essence of the com- modity structure has already been frequently emphasized: it resides in the fact that a relation, a connection among persons acquires a thing-like character and thereby a 'ghostly objectivity' that conceals all trace of its essential nature as a relation among human beings through the strict, apparently completely closed and rational dictates of</page><page sequence="28">206 Walter Benjamin's Historicism (Ver-Dinglichung) - which always suggests that something "living" has become petrified - lies in Marx's genetic formngenetisch) method, whose mythological status still remains to be indicated. This relation among things is a "phantom" only to the extent that another human society is conceivable. Of course, Marx too does not forget the human beings besieged by these material relations; it is revealing, however, that where he speaks of the producers' 'own' selves he also falls into anorma- tive mode of argumentation: "The actual (Eigenes) social movement of the producers possesses for them the form of a movement of things which they do not control but which control them."82 The last part of the sentence shows the historico-philosophical orientation of the Marx- ian analysis of captial: human beings were supposed to be able to actually determine for themselves the concrete goals of their produc- tion and the speed at which their society was to develop in order to end the phase of its "natural history." Only against the background of this envisioned task does the "actual" (eigene) at the beginning of the sen- tence make sense; as a statement about the movement of real existing capital it is meaningless. In the context of nineteenth-century theories of history, a more fun- damental opposition can scarcely be imagined than that between the historicist-life-philosophical and the Marxian concept of form. What for the former is objectification, the expression and mark of a human signature that can be understood, is for the latter the self-objectifica- tion of a social relation, the "expression" of a relation among things its own laws" (Geschichte und Klassenbewusstsein, op. cit., p. 94) - stands at the forefront of Western Marxism; it shows that quite independently of the rediscovery of Marx's early writings, Lebensphilosophie had rediscovered for itself the problem of "alienation." It accompanies anxieties - typical for the period and today proliferating once again - at the rationalization of life and the mechanization of the soul. Later, too, Benjamin, who could describe Lukics' History and Class Consciousness as the "most rigorous phil- osophical work in the Marxist repertoire" (III, 17 1), understood the "fetishism of the world of commodities" in the context of a theory of "human self-alienation," as his excerpts from Korsch show (V, 813; Korsch, Karl Marx, op. cit., p. 97 ff.). Adorno's late polemic against reification - "Thought easily and consolingly imagines it possesses the philosopher's stone in the dissolution of the reification inherent in the commodity structure" and: "In the face of the possibility of total catastrophe, reification is an epiphenomenon; so, above all, is the alienation that accompanies it" (Negative Dialektik [Frankfurt, 1966], p. 189) - merely indicates that Lukics' philosophy of history has been replaced by a theology of history that in the place of a philosophical-imperialist annexation of the "alien" finds its happiness in the Benjaminian notion "that [the alien] remains distant and different amidst whatever nearness is granted" (ibid., p. 190). Both variants have until now prevented Western Marxism from developing a rational posture toward capitalism. 82. Marx, Das Kapital, 1st edition, op. cit., p. 39.</page><page sequence="29">H.D. Kittsteiner 207 which cannot be "understood." By a process of reversal, the concrete here figures as the bearer of this abstract, general relation. "Within the value-relation and the expression of value understood therein, the abstract-general does not count as a property of the concrete, sensorial- real, but the sensorial-concrete is, on the contrary, an appearance or a specific realization of the abstract-general."S3 Although Benjamin could not have known this sentence, he was familiar with a subsequent passage from the first edition of Capital which Korsch had included in his 1932 edition; he also copied it down and inserted it into the context of the second peculiarity of the equivalent form (V, 807f.). If I am not mistaken, he did not, however, clearly perceive its divergence from his own version for the nature of the fetish. He does note that the "value" of every product of labor is transformed into a social hieroglyph (V, 807), but he sticks to his task of deciphering the phantasms of the dreaming collective. Where he promises to deal with the expression of the abstract- general in the concrete, he does so in strangely inadequate terms: "Marx presents the causal relations between economics and culture. Here we are concerned with their expressive relations. It is not the economic origin of culture which is to be expounded but the expres- sion of the economy in its culture. It is, in other words, a question of attempting to grasp the economic process as a sensory, original phe- nomenon* (anschauliches Urphdinomen, see translator's footnotes on Goethe's Urphiinomen) out of which all the living manifestations of the arcades (and to that extent of the 19th century) emerge" (V, 573 f.). Phrases like "expression of the economy in its culture" and "the living manifestations of the arcades" point once again to the materialist his- toricist; it seems doubtful as best whether the double character of labor can ultimately be represented - for it would be a question of nothing less - as an "original phenomenon."84 83. Ibid., p. 771. 84. It appears that Benjamin wanted to deploy the Urphiinomen polemically against the vulgar materialist schema of base and superstructure (cf. also V, 495; on the transposition of the "Urphinomen from the realm of nature to that of history," cf. V, 577). Now Marx's own concern is certainly not with a "causal relation" between economics and culture, but already with an "expressive relation" - namely, that of the abstract-general within the concrete. This and nothing else characterizes the so- called "formal-genetic method" (on the concept of the "formal-genetic," cf. Marx, Theorien iiber den Mehrwert, Vol. 3, [MEW 26], p. 491). Benjamin's respect for the task of representing the history of capital "as the far-reaching, steel scaffolding of a theory" (1, 1241 and 1252) might be reconciled with the polarity of the Urphdnomen to the extent that both represent the fullness of phenomena - on the one hand as the shady area between value and use-value, on the other, in terms of the "doctrine of colors," as the "cloudiness" between "light" and "darkness" (cf. J.W. Goethe, Farbenlehre, 175). The difference would probably only reappear with the problem of the "intelligibility" of those forms of expression.</page><page sequence="30">208 Walter Benjamin's Historicism Let us here interrupt our confrontation of Benjamin and Marx and summarize the purpose of the preceding argument. Marx was delib- erately read as a "hard" theoretician ofreification; a connection to the concept of alienation from his early writings had to be bracketed. No misunderstanding of Marxian theory was imputed to Benjamin, but rather an open departure from it; one must see what such a departure yields and what it costs. What it yields is a Gestalt theory of the capitalist commodity; its price is a turning away from a rational concept of his- tory. However sensitively Benjamin responds to signals of the phantas- magoria, he is relatively deaf to the noise of the historical process itself. This relationship to history may be observed in Benjamin's critique of the idea of progress. Seen apart from the theoretical implications of his idea of redemption (cf. note 70), the critique is above all politically inspired and as such - directed as it is against social democracy and party communism - not implausible. What it underestimates, how- ever, is the fact that the history of capitalism in the historical period produced by the accumulation of capital is structurally identical with the concept - usually designated as progress - of a process realizing itself behind the backs of its producers. "From that moment on," Ben- jamin writes, "the idea of progress necessarily ran counter to the criti- cal theory of history, since it could no longer measure specific historical changes but rather the tension between a legendary begin- ning and a legendary end of history. In other words, as soon as prog- ress becomes the signature of the course of history in its entirety, the concept contributes to an uncritical hypostatization instead of a critical questioning" (V, 598f.). This assessment should be reversed: as long as the idea of progress entailed only this or that critique of the status quo, a truly critical theory of history could have no use for it. Only when progress comes to characterize the course of history in its entirety does it emerge that it in no way amounted to an uncritical hypostatization, but rather to a fully realized concept of history. When Benjamin insists on his adherence to the "elementary doctrine of historical material- ism" - again clearly in contradistinction to "historicism": "History disintegrates into images, not histories" (V, 596) - 15 the one is, strictly speaking, as incorrect as the other. "History" disintegrates neither into images nor histories; it doesn't disintegrate at all, but rather asserts itself as a collective singular with a material substratum in the process of capital accumulation. 85. On the transition from "histories" to "history" cf. R. Koselleck's "Geschichte, Geschichten und formale Zeitstrukturen" and his "Historia Magistra Vitae.

Kittsteiner 209 Marx develops a real basis - and if it still means anything to speak of a "historical materialist" it is in this sense - for the movement of mod- ern history beyond the control of its producers, a movement that was perceived almost simultaneously by the philosophy of history and classical political economy. Marx makes the investigation of the social formation, which "hangs like a fate" over the producers, 86 the center of his analysis. It in no way diminishes his achievement that this diagnosis was accompanied by an attempted therapy that is no longer applicable today. Behind the figure of the "world spirit," he recognizes the world market; he disqualifies the contentually determined time of the philo- sophy of history and replaces it with the time of capital development.87 In his preoccupation with the critique of an edifyingly utopian notion of progress, Benjamin loses sight of this crux of the historical process. Such time is in no way "empty" or "homogeneous," but rather pro- duces itself according to the rhythm of the structure of approp- riation.88 It is also free of all anthropomorphic overtones: "Progress is the first historical category that was posited in order to describe a genuinely historical time without natural or mythical attachments.""9 86. "Individuals are subsumed under social production, which exists as a fate out- side them; but social production is not subsumed under individuals who treat it as their common wealth" (Marx, Grundrisse, op. cit., p. 76). 87. Marx, Die deutsche Ideologie, MEW Vol. 3, p. 37; since Kant's critique of the "numbers cabbala" and the "holy chronology" of the messianic faith in history (Kant, Der Streit der Facultdten, AA, Vol. VI, p. 62), the demand has arisen that, instead of history being made to accord with chronology, chronology should be made to accord with his- tory (ibid., p. 195). "Time" is no longer the outer form, "in which all histories play themselves out; rather, it itself acquires a historical quality. History no longer takes place in time, but through time. Time becomes a dynamic force of history itselP' (R. Koselleck, "'Neuzeit.' Zur Semantik moderner Bewegungsbegriffe" in Koselleck, ed., Studien zum Beginn der modernen Welt [Stuttgart, 1977], p. 279). - The historical time opened up by Kant is initially, however, the time of the philosophy of history, i.e. the "unfolding (Auslegung) of the spirit in time" (Hegel, Die Vernunfit in der Geschichte, op. cit., p. 154). Only in the "measureless" movement of capital does historical time become identical with growing accumulation and the speed of its growth (Marx, Das Kapital [MEW 23], p. 650). 88. Benjamin's critique of a "homogeneous and empty time" (I, 701) does not basically affect either historicism or an understanding of historical time (aside from the idea of a "continual" representation; V, 588) that takes its bearings from Marx (if we disregard for the time being his critique of a "homogeneous," "continuous" mode of exposition; V, 588), but only unworkable attempts to measure history according to the standard of "mechanical change." "This time is certainly a relatively empty form, the filling ofwhich it makes no sense to imagine. The time of history is, however, quite dif- ferent from that of mechanics" (II, 134). From the very outset, "messianic time" (ibid.) emerges as the adversary of this time. Cf., on the connexion of historical time and the structure of appropriation, H.D.

The "unconscious" dimension of this temporal structure in Marx finds its most uncompromising expression in the relation of law and competition."9 The movement of history that realizes itself beyond the consciousness of the participants results, again, not even from blind human impulses or emotions, but from the struggle over participation in the average rate of profit. The people who act out these relations figure only as the bearers of social relations or "economic character masks."9' They are supposedly wide awake; they would reject the idea that they are dreamers. Yet from the perspective of the historical conse- quences of their actions (a vantage-point which cannot, however, be contentually filled, but exists only as an imaginary, empty place, not as a God's eye view of history) they will have acted like dreamers. Human- ity does not stand only before old inscriptions the keys to which have been lost, as Schopenhauer says, "like a sleepwalker who finds before him in the morning what he made in sleep.""92 The same holds true for his most modern productions. This is where Benjamin has his field of inquiry as an investigator of the myths of the 19th century; this is where his observations belong concerning the correspondences between modem technology and archaic symbolism, and the "originary histori- cal (urgeschichtlich) moment" disclosed in the most recent past by noth- ing other than the accelerated speed of historical development (V, 576).9" And here too, finally, belongs the notion of the fetish. Taking as our starting point the standard question of how a confrontation of Ben- jamin with Marx would turn out on this point, we first posited a subjec- 90. On the heels of the exposition of the theoretical context - "No category of bourgeois economics, not the first one, for example the determination of value, becomes real as a result of free competition" - follow the consequences for the concepts of "freedom" and "necessity," that "highest problem of transcendental philosophy" (cf., p. 15): "This kind of individual freedom is, therefore, both the most complete sup- pression of all individual freedom and the complete subjugation of individuality under social conditions, which assume the form of objective powers, indeed of over- powering things - things that have themselves become independent of the indi- viduals relating to them" (Marx, Grundrisse, op. cit., p. 545). 91. The treatment of persons as "personifications of economic categories" is by no means only a methodological trick; it is of far-reaching theoretical importance (Marx, Das Kapital, [MEW 231, op. cit., p. 16). 92. Schopenhauer, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, op. cit., p. 509. 93. "The old prehistoric shudder already enshrouds our parents' surroundings, because we are no longer bound to them by tradition. Perceptual worlds (Merkwelten) fall apart faster, their mythical dimension comes more quickly and crassly to the fore; an entirely different perceptual world must just as quickly be set up against it" (V, 576).</page><page sequence="33">H.D. Kittsteiner 211 tive deviation on Benjamin's part, but then argued that in Marx him- self the "fetish" expresses rather more poorly what is required of it. In the notion of the "phantasmagoria," on the other hand, the fetish is in its element: it is that thing which is constituted by and overladen with power-wishes and wish projections by means ofwhich humanity dares to involve itself in the power struggle of things.94 The objective content of the Marxian doctrine of the intentionless self-objectification of things nevertheless remains valid with regard to the totality of the his- torical process. There would be no reason to object to a metaphorics of dream and sleep as a way of describing the unconscious production of history if this image didn't inevitably carry with it the idea of an "awakening." Such rhetoric of the awakening shows that, like every philosopher of history, Benjamin thinks beyond the temporal limitations of his own epistemological situation (V, 579; I, 1237).91 What marks the revolu- 94. Freud describes "fetishism" as a "compromise formation aided by dis- placements like those that are familiar to us from dreams" (Gesammelte Werke, Vol. XVII, p. 133). The unacknowledged - but nonetheless perceived - reality, in this case the woman's lack of a penis - gives rise to a substitute formation "under the rule of unconscious laws of thought." This substitute betokens at the same time a triumph over fear, in this case the threat of castration (GW XIV, 313) - If one tries to build a bridge to Marx, it can only consist in the problem of a reality that is simultaneously per- ceived and denied. Fetishism cannot only be related, in the wake of Marx, to the autonomization of value; the concept of fetishism must also incorporate the dimension of the commodity's use-value as a reaction to the perception of historical powerless- ness. Hegel's formulation - "Just as chidren have the impulse to play and human beings the impulse to adorn themselves, so too we have here the impulse to possess something tangible, something autonomous and powerful, and the consciousness of an arbitrary connection that can just as easily be annulled .. ." (Hegel, Vorlesungen iiber die Philosophie der Religion I, op. cit., p. 294) - anticipates the function of the commodity's use-value: it serves as a fetish, a tangible replacement for a power or wish-fulfillment that does not exist in reality; at the same time, its possession serves as defense against fear in the face of history. The specific compromise formation of the commodity form, which entails that the fetish not be of lasting service but rather get beaten, thrown away and exchanged, resides in its dual nature. Its function as a component of self-realizing commodity capital "censors," so to speak, its wish-form and allows it to become a dis- torted "phantasmagoria." 95. In Hegel the "now" of knowability (Erkennbarkeit) was linked to the revelation of God in history: "Whether or not the time is ripe for knowledge must depend on whether that which is the world's final goal has finally entered reality in universally valid, conscious fashion" (Hegel: Die Vernunft in der Geschichte, op. cit., p. 45). Benjamin's Messianic concept of historical time gambles on a "temporal kernel implanted both in the knower and the known" (V, 578). It is identical with that "secret index" by which the past is referred to redemption (I, 693). Both in the object world as well as in the "dreaming collective," a "teleological moment" functions in the context of the dream as a waiting for the awakening (V, 492). "The historical index of the images signifies not only that they belong to a particular time, but above all that it is only at a particular time</page><page sequence="34">212 Walter Benjamin's Historicism tionary awakening for Marx is the possibility of transforming a social structure which has held humanity captive in a "dream-sleep." The complication resides in the fact that an awakening must always be con- ceived before the awakening: before humanity consciously controls its production, at least the revolutionary class must have come to its sen- ses. It is supposed to awaken in the same surroundings that, under the dull pressures of everyday life, prompts it to fall asleep.96 In Ben- jamin's last years, the hope for a "left" - as opposed to a right - awakening is dramatically accentuated. His political investment in a proletarian dream-collective leads him back via a series of associations to Sorel, on whom he had already relied in the "Critique of Violence."97 All the later themes are prefigured here: the task of projecting a revolutionary myth as an "order of images" "capable of involuntarily calling forth all the attitudes that correspond to the various declara- tions of war that socialism has taken up against modern society." They amount to an inclination to entrust oneself to an intuitive socialism which invokes a Bergsonian insight into an instantaneously perceived totality with the goal of pitting "the image of the total catastrophe that the general strike preserves in a truly perfect manner" against a failing politics of progress and reform.9" "History in the strict sense is thus an image from involuntary mem- ory, an image that suddently occurs to the subject of history at the moment of danger. The historian's powers depend on his sharpened sensitivity to the crisis which the subject of history has entered at any that they become legible" (V, 577). In and of itself such a model would not imply much more than that every generation deciphers the secret of the one that went before it, for every age "is a sphinx that plunges into the abyss as soon as its riddle has been solved" (H. Heine, Die Romantische Schule, Werke, ed. H. Friedemann/R. Pissin, Part 9, p. 33). The idea of the "awakening" gets its Messianic overtones only through the "moment of danger" (I, 1243) and only therewith its peculiar quality as a historically unique moment of knowledge. 96. It is worth considering whether Marx wrote to exorcise the fear that this society might not prove itself to be an "organism constantly in the process of transformation," but rather a "solid crystal." (Marx, Das Kapital, [MEW 23], p. 16). For apart from general statements concerning the customary dependence of the working class on the structure of capital (ibid., p. 765), he also allows for variable forms of subordination to capital in the extreme phases of its cyclical crises: with increasing wages the "golden chain" that the proletariat has forged for itself loosens (ibid., p. 646); if the law of the "in- dustrial reserve army" fully takes effect, that chain also binds "the worker more firmly to capital than Hephaestus forged Prometheus to the rock" (ibid., p. 675). 97.

This subject is by no means a transcendental subject but rather the struggling oppressed class in its most exposed situation (I, 1243). Benjamin was no modern mythologist but rather a critic of myth. He understood the myth of the eternal return as the reverse side of a progress that was running an empty (V, 175; 178), and knew that fascist myth operated on a false promise of autonomy in the face of the heteronomy of history.99 Yet he was himself not wholly immune to the temptation to invest the historical process with libido. In his last years, he no longer places his hopes on a hidden connection between the pro- fane order and the coming of the Messianic kingdom (II, 204) but only on catastrophe and a cessation of happening (I, 1243). But this stage of the historical process is in turn overlaid with a phantasmagoria that is, strictly speaking, inappropriate to it. No series of steps leads from the phantasmagoria of the commodity to that of history (V, 117 1).100 In the middle of the 19th century history undergoes structural transfor- 99. Ansgar Hillach, "Der Anteil der Kultur an der Praigung faschistischer Herr- schaftsmittel," in Walter Benjamin. Profane Erleuchtung und rettende Kritik, ed. N.W. Bolz/ R. Faber (Wfirzburg, 1982), p. 291 f. - On the function of myth in the tension between autonomy and heteronomy, cf. O. Marquard: "Zur Funktion der Mythologiephilos- ophie bei Schelling" (in Terror und Spiel, op. cit., p. 257 ff.) and the discussion on "Myth and Autonomy" (ibid., p. 639 ff.). The emigration into aesthetics has been described by Marquard as follows: "the autonomous subject cannot cope with history, seeks help in nature and flees from its alien superiority into art" (ibid., p. 641). P. Szondi answered that mythology is not "heteronomous history, but rather the realization of the identity of autonomy and heteronomy that was at first thought possible only in the aesthetic sphere and was then maintained to have always and already been the case" (ibid., p. 640). In this return from aesthetics to history, myth unfolds its fascist potential as the promise of autonomy amidst the heteronomy, "the aestheticization of political life" (I, 506). No "politicization of art" is a match for this seduction, but only the destructive severance of history from all contents and goals. Only if the craving for the "true" state of emergence vanishes can the urge toward a false reconcilation also be checked. 100. It is clear from the letter to Horkheimer of 3.13.1939 that in his Baudelaire project Benjamin had in mind a "whole series of phantasmagorias" that were to lead "Blanqui's great phantasmagoria of the universe" (V, 1171 ). Benjamin's critical inten- tion - "Blanqui's cosmic speculation teaches us that humanity will remain at the mercy of mythical fear as long as phantasmagoria has a place in its imagination" - cannot hide the fact that he was fascinated by this text (V, 1256 f.). The basic idea of the myth of the eternal return "is the world as punishment - the punishment itself engen- ders the culprit" (I, 1234). Even in this image the false transposition of the autonomous into the heteronomous is still clear; the anthropomorphic notion of a "punitive" his- tory again gets in the way of what is really needed: to imagine the "dark power of fate" as an impersonal one (Freud, GW, Vol. XIII, p. 381). The "Force-becomes-meaning" syndrome (Adorno, Negative Dialektik, op. cit., p. 308) expresses itself both in the idea of being guilty for something that has come about "unintentionally" and in the wish to be redeemed from this web of guilt (Schuldzusammenhang). In this sense, I would also count Benjamin's concept of a "messianic history" among the phantasmagorias.</page><page sequence="36">214 Walter Benjamin's Historicism mations; it can now only be heteronomously conceived and yields to no human signature. The following sentence also applies more or less to Benjamin: "All who ascribe the direction of world events to provi- dence, God, or God and Nature, prompt the suspicion that they still experience these remote and ultimate powers mythologically like parents and believe themselves bound to them by libidinal ties."'0' In the face of real existing capitalism, such a tie to history is inadequate, whether it is conceived in terms of a philosophy or of a theology of his- tory. The true myth of modernity is the myth of a complete heter- onomy, one in which no gods, heroes or men appear - only things. Karl Marx told the story: the one about the birth of money from the mutual reflection of twenty yards of linen and one skirt. Benjamin averts his eyes from this real substratum of history and shares this aversion with all historicism. His historicism is materialist because he reads the distortion in the phenomenon; his materialism remains historicist because, instead of limiting the concept of phantas- magoria to objects produced by capitalism, whose human signature has been effaced, he extends it to history itself. As the reference point for his analysis, then, he doesn't choose the qualityless process of the real, but rather a historico-theological point of entry from which res- cue and redemption might be conceived. The prudent Adorno senses this danger when, hedging his messianism with epistemological con- siderations, he describes the "standpoint of redemption" in Nr. 153 of his Minima Moralia as the only one "for which responsibility can still be taken" but one which he knows at the same time may not be adopted if the knowledge we produce is to have binding validity.102 IV Epilogue A series of Benjaminian images need to be reconsidered. I already 101. The predisposition towards a libidinal bond with history (Freud, Gesammelte Werke , Vol. XIII, p. 381) seems to have been acquired in a society in which an outer ring of things and objective relations, together with the economic character-masks that in- habit it behind a patriarchal fagade, is, if not dominated, nevertheless mortally wound- ed by a basic matriarchal complex (Kernkomplex) centered on the family. These and other reflections are the result of long conversations with Hortense v. Heppe concern- ing the escape from the world of the mothers, and the brother-horde as a positive counter-image to "male bonding" (Miinnerbund). M. Stoessel's demonstration that the "forgotten human" dimension originates in the mother-child relation (M. Stoessel, Aura. Das vergessene Menschliche. Zu Sprache und Erfahrung bei Walter Benjamin, [Miinchen, 1983], p. 150) shows how difficult it is to find one's bearings in a historical world that does not respond to our gaze. 102. Theodor W.

Kittsteiner 215 proposed at the outset that theology and Marxism exchange places in the image of the chess-player. And why in the IX thesis does the angel of history believe he can afford to turn his back to the future? Were he to turn around, he would see another pile of wreckage in front of him. That can only be of service to the "organization of pessimism." It pre- supposes mistrust. Mistrust also, however, in the myth of awakening and the theology of redemption. "And unlimited trust only in I.G. Far- ben and the peaceful advances of the air force" (II, 308). "But what now, what then?" "Marx says: revolutions are the locomotives of world history. But perhaps that is not all the case. Perhaps revolutions are the reaching for the emergency brake of the human beings traveling on this train" (I, 1232). Fine. Here is the train. But where is the emergency brake? And who has the long arm to reach it and the strength to pull it? Faced with the idea that all dreams are in a sense dreams of con- venience that serve the purpose of prolonging sleep but not of disturb- ing it,'03 Freud turns his interest to those dreams that manage none- theless to awaken us from our slumbers. "It is like chasing away a fly in one's sleep; one awakens ad hoc. When one falls back asleep, one has removed the disturbance."104 The historical materialist can't count on more than such an ad-hoc awakening, not even at the moment of greatest danger.And that is already a lot: it is probably that celebrated "blow with the left hand" (IV, 89).o?5 Translated by Jonathan Monroe and Irving Wohlfarth 103. Freud, Die Traumdeutung, GW II/III, p. 239. 104. Ibid., p. 583. 105. As a reader of Bachofen, Benjamin was familiar with the meaning of "left" and "right" (II, 228). The blow with the left hand should not, however, be conceived heroically; it is a matter, rather, of feeling out historical danger while half-asleep - beyond all the overworked phantasmagorias of happiness, explosion, and redemp- tion. "While the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex (in the case of right-handed persons) verbalizes abstract, logical thinking, the right hemisphere specializes in feel- ing out the total spatial Gestalt. It feels out the forest, whereas the left hemisphere can- not see the wood for the trees." Klaus D. Hoppe, "Die Trennung der Gehirnhdilften," in Psyche 29, 1975/10, p. 920.</page></plain_text>
