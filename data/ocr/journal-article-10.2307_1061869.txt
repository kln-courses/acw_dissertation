<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. Montgomery Watt THE DECLINE OF THE ALMOHADS REFLECTIONS ON THE VIABILITY OF RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS There will always be something of a mystery about the growth and development of Islam, as indeed there is about all the great religions. When one reflects on the facts, it is truly astounding that the message of the Qur'an, originally addressed to the relatively uncultured citizens of Mecca, should have been capable of becom- ing the basis of a great civilization whose leading exponents stood for centuries in the highest ranks of human culture. It might be suggested that military success contributed to the development, together with the existence of a situation in which military success on the scale of the Arab conquests was possible. Yet the military success itself owed something to the religion and, at the same time, was never more than one facet of the whole. It would be more adequate to say that the bearers of the religion of Islam were somehow able to respond more or less successfully to the series of challenges which they had to face. This growth of Islam to be a world religion is all the more astounding when it is contrasted with the ultimate failure of movements within Islamic history which in their early stages appeared to have a similar degree of success. One such is that 23</page><page sequence="2">The Decline of the Almohads branch of the Shi'ite movement which produced the Fatimid state to flourish for a time and then disappear. The present article, however, will confine itself to the Almohad movement, which had its origin in the preaching of Ibn-Tfumart in the early twelfth century, subdued before the end of that century vast territories in North Africa and Spain, and yet in the next century faded away to nothing. Ibn-Tumart (born ca. 1080) belonged to a tribe of Berber mountaineers from the Atlas, but had the opportunity of studying in Cordova, Alexandria, Mecca, and Baghdad. His visit to these intellectual centres of the Islamic world filled him with a great desire for the reform of the Muslim West (North Africa and Spain). On his way back from Alexandria, both in the ship and in the towns where he paused, he began to preach, though with little success and much opposition. He gained a devoted follower, how- ever, in a young Berber of another tribe, 'Abd-al-Mu'min. Together they retired to a remote spot in southern Morocco, but after a period of incubation, when the movement received a definite dog- matic and hierarchical form, emerged with a sufficient military force of Berber tribesmen to challenge such troops as the Almora- vid rulers had in the neighborhood. There were ups and downs. Ibn-Timart was killed in battle in 1130, but at length in 1147 'Abd-al-Mu'min was able to inflict a decisive defeat on the Almoravids. From this point he gradually extended his sway to embrace all the Almoravid empire and more-eastern Algeria, Tunisia, and much of Tripolitania to the east, and what was left of Islamic Spain to the north across the straits. Up to this point there is a certain parallelism between Ibn- Tumart's movement and that of Muhammad himself. Both began among rough frontiersmen on the periphery of lands of higher civilization; in the case of Muhammad it was Iraq and Syria; in the case of Ibn-Timart, Tunisia and Islamic Spain. Both success- fully met a series of challenges, practical and intellectual alike, and established an empire which included the lands of higher civiliza- tion. Yet there the parallel ends. Muhammad's movement went from strength to strength. The Almohads, as the followers of Ibn- Tamart and 'Abd-al-Mu'min were called, may be said to have reached their zenith in 1172 when they gained virtual control of most of Islamic Spain. They were still able to gain a great victory over Christian enemies at Alarcos in 1195; but a great defeat at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 showed that they were rapidly weakening. By 1223 their central administration in Spain had 24</page><page sequence="3">collapsed; and dynastic quarrels and the resulting inability to control subordinates led to the decline of their power in North Africa, until it was finally extinguished in 1269. Is it possible to find any reasons which would help to explain why Islam went on to be a world religion while Almohadism faded into nothingness? It is impossible to give a definitive answer to this question without instituting a whole series of comparisons, and that cannot be attempted in a single article. Some suggestions will be offered here, however, with a view to stimulating further discussion and research. In the field of moral and social reform we read that Ibn-Tumart preached against the laxity of the authorities in permitting the sale of wine, the production of pork, the use of musical instru- ments, and the presence of unveiled women in mixed gatherings.1 At first sight this might seem to be parallel to the moral and social reforms preached by Muhammad; but the appearance is deceptive. For one thing Muhammad is more concerned with basic social injustice, as, for example, in the perversion of traditional custom for the advantage of individuals. Though Ibn-Tumart is said to have been concerned about the misappropriation of the property of orphans, the matters mentioned above are peripheral and not central. Moreover, these matters affected "others" rather than Ibn-Tuimart's own followers; these were at first mostly tribesmen from a rough, hard life, and the moral criticisms sound like their protest against the soft life of the city-dwellers, not an attempt to reform themselves. If this suggestion is correct, it is not surprising that the Almohads found it difficult to retain the loyality of the inhabitants of the great urban centres. Muhammad's preaching, on the contrary, was from the first concerned with the vices of towns and of his own community. The field of moral and social reform, however, is probably less important and less decisive than the field of doctrine. When one looks at Ibn-Tumart's doctrines (as contained in his "book") in their historical context, it appears that many points he adopted were relevant to particular problems-and probably adopted for this reason. His whole "book," indeed, is the rhetorical expansion of a few simple ideas. Thus he claims to be the Mahdi, the divinely guided leader; and this is usually reckoned as a form of the Shi'ite conception of the imam. This claim was presumably made in order 1 Le Livre de Mohammed ibn Toumert, ed. J. D. Luciani (Algiers, 1903), Intro- duction (by Ignaz Goldziher), p. 97.

At the same time he was probably meeting a deep spiritual need of the Berbers, whose religious history is dominated by various types of charismatic leaders. Another point of doctrine emphasized by Ibn-Timart was the rejection of anthropomorphism (tajsim); that is, he insisted that the anthropomorphic terms used of God in the Qur'an, such as "hand" and "face," must not be understood literally. This was essentially a denunciation of his opponents, the Almoravids, and their supporters, the Malikite jurists of Spain and North Africa, and was part of his justification for attacking them physically. This doctrinal position indicates the acceptance of reason to a certain extent, and is similar to that of the Ash'arite theological school (dominant in Iraq); but Ibn-Tfumart is more rationalistic than the Ash'arites in his view of the relation of God to his attri- butes. Indeed, he conceives God as a bare abstract unity, and he and his followers came to look on this "assertion of unity" (taw'hid) as the distinctive feature of their movement; the name "Almohads" is a Europeanization of the corresponding Arabic participle, al-muwahhidin, "the asserters of unity." This seems to have been closely linked in his thought with the rejection of anthropomorphism. The doctrine of the attributes had little relevance to practical matters, but the general acceptance of reason was practically important. Ibn-Tumart also gave a place to reason in his conception of jurisprudence. On particular matters of law the Malikite jurists of Spain (and elsewhere in the Almoravid dominions) accepted the teaching of their school as contained in a few standard books, and did not consider how the particular rules were to be derived from the first principles or "roots" of law, especially the Qur'an and the Traditions about Muhammad. In opposition to the Malikites Ibn- Tumart held that it ought to be part of the training of a jurist to know how particular rules were derived from the "roots," and that therefore he must be familiar with the Qur'an and the Traditions. In his book, however, he discusses only a small number of par- ticular rules, and does not seem to have wanted to introduce any widespread reforms on the basis of his conception of jurisprudence. Thus in this matter it seems that he was chiefly interested in attacking the Malikite supporters of the Almoravids. On the other hand, it is curious to find him emphasizing the importance of the type of Traditions known as "widely transmitted" (mutawdtir).2 2 Cf. Islamic Quarterly, VII, 31-32. 26</page><page sequence="5">These Traditions dealt with matters generally accepted by the community of Muslims and so widely known that no definite transmitters were named. They were distinguished from the great body of Traditions, each of which was handed down by a few chains of transmitters whose names were known. It may be that on this point Ibn-Tfmart was trying to show that he favored the central Malikite school of Medina (as distinct from the Spanish school) over the schools of Iraq. If Ibn-Tfmart's moral and social preaching was peripheral and sectional, his doctrinal emphases are a hotchpotch; that is to say, they consist of a number of unrelated and apparently incom- patible points, which have been adopted because of some immedi- ate practical relevance. The root of the difficulty is that Ibn- Tumart has no radically new conception of the state or a way of life. Basically he accepts the Sunnite conception of the Islamic polity and way of life. Though he considers himself Mahdi and imam, these are not interpreted in a Shi'ite sense. For one thing he acknowledges that Abf-Bakr was rightful imam, which no good Shi'ite would do. For another he looks on the Mahdi as the agent of the Sharl'a (or ideal law), with the duty of "ordering the right" in accordance with that, and not as an independent legal authority. To accept the Shari'a, however, meant ultimately to accept the jurists or ulema, for it was only they who could pronounce with authority on the content of the Shari'a. This does not imply that the Almohads were bound to accept the Malikite jurists resident in their empire. It is conceivable that they could have encouraged the formation of a rival body of jurists to the Malikite who would have worked out a whole legal system on the principles of Ibn- Tumart. In actual fact this did not happen to any appreciable extent, and eventually, when things became difficult and the populace restless, the Almohad rulers had to seek the support of the Malikite jurists. The appearance of incompatibility between various points of Almohad doctrine is again something which is not necessarily final. It is conceivable that an intellectual genius could have found some way of harmonizing and unifying what at first sight was incompatible. Once again, however, the fact is that no such genius emerged among the Almohad subjects. So the conclusion seems to be forced upon us that the essential Almohad failure was a failure to convert. Because the teaching of the movement was peripheral, sectional, and not sufficiently radical, it became more and more irrelevant to the needs of people outside the milieu in which the 27</page><page sequence="6">The Decline of the Almohads movement first sprang up. Military successes could not prolong the life of the movement once it had stopped converting indi- viduals. By the thirteenth century we hear of a member of the ruling family who disbelieved in the official doctrines. This conclusion is not invalidated if we admit that there were some needs of some sections of the Muslim inhabitants of the Almohad empire which were met by Ibn-Tfmart's teaching. As already noticed, his claim to be the Mahdi may have satisfied the need of the Berbers for a charismatic leader. It is possible that to some extent and in some form such a need is present in all men; but, if so, then the Almohads must have put forward their claim in ways which left many men dissatisfied. Again, many men have what may be described as a need for a rational comprehension of their religion-for some harmonizing of reason and revelation. To such people Almohadism may have brought a solution of their difficulties and so a satisfaction of their need. It was certainly the Almohad outlook that made possible the flourishing of philosophy in Spain in Ibn-Tufayl and Averroes (Ibn-Rushd). Yet the section of the population which experienced the need for a rational religion must have been small; and the problem of how a rational theology was to be related to the religion of the masses was never adequately solved in Spain. In Ibn-Tufayl's philosophical romance the final retirement of Hayy ibn-Yaqzan and his friend to the desert island is a confession of failure to solve this problem; and though Averroes solved it in his own life (by being both a Shari'a judge and a philosopher), he had practically no influence on his fellow-Muslims. The conclusion that the failure of Almohadism was essentially a failure to make converts from all sections of the community and converts of sufficiently high quality is supported when we turn back to look at the prophet Muhammad. As already noticed, in the moral and social field he was constantly aiming at the reform of his own community; though he accepted current morality in certain respects (e.g., the blood-feud or corporate responsibility for crime), most of the points he emphasized were central and con- cerned with basic social injustice. From a doctrinal and general point of view he was putting forward a radically new conception of the community and way of life. The body politic which he gradually established at Medina was analogous to an Arab tribe in many ways, but its basis was religious-the acceptance by its members of the truth and validity of the revelations which Muhammad claimed to have received from God. Thus the Islamic 28</page><page sequence="7">community came to be regarded as a community actually con- stituted by its possession of a divinely revealed way of life-the way or sunna of Muhammad, given to him by God and practiced by him. It was above all this conception of the charismatic or divinely founded and guided community that inspired countless men to labor at the solution of the practical and intellectual prob- lems confronting the Islamic body politic in its early centuries.3 They were not merely converted but made to respond from the depths of their being. These remarks refer primarily, of course, to the Sunnite or majority form of Islam. The several Shi'ite minorities have on the contrary found their inspiration in a charismatic leader. It would appear that some men devote themselves more readily to a charismatic community, others to a charismatic leader. The leader is likely to have the greater immediate influence, but history suggests that in the long run a stable society is only established where there is some awareness of the charismatic nature of the community. The great religions are almost bound to attempt to find some harmony of the two conceptions (and Ibn-Tfimart could be regarded as exploring one avenue in quest of this goal). The continuing cleavage within Islam between Sunnites and Shi'ites is an indication of the failure to achieve a harmonization, that is, to find a doctrinal complex which will satisfy the needs of the different types of men. Perhaps it has been worthwhile to follow out this line of reflec- tion in order to reassert a truth which is obvious and yet which is often evaded-a great religion is one which abundantly and widely satisfies men's religious needs. 3 Cf. the author's Islam and the Integration of Society (London, 1961), esp. pp. 202-9. 29</page></plain_text>
