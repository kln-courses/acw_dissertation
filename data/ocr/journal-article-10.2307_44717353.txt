It is considered a possibility that a sizable percentage of these injuries and fatalities are avoidable, within the realm of aircraft crashworthiness design, utilizing practical improve- ments with regulatory potential. To this end, general aviation crashworthiness studies have been in process within the Fed- eral Aviation Administration (FAA) at Washington headquar- ters, the Aeronautical Center at Oklahoma City, Okla., and the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center (NAFEC), Atlantic City, N.J. In the recently initiated study at NAFEC it is planned to investigate certain aspects of fuselage design, seat design, and restraint system design, from both the theore- tical and empirical aspects. Differentiation is sought between improvements adaptable to retrofit and those adaptable to new assembly. A problem of immediate concern is one particularly evident in accidents, namely, that serious injuries and fatalities have been experienced by occupants, particularly pilot and copilot, even though the fuselage and restraint systems have remained basically intact during the crash. The injuries have been caused in many cases by collision of the head and chest with the in- strument panel, control yokes, and windshield and windshield posts, as a result of lack of support of the upper torso offered by the restraint systems. With the exception of general avia- tion aircraft type certificated after September 1969, the Federal Aviation Regulations require only lap belt restraint systems for emergency landing conditions. In many of these crashes predominantly longitudinal decelerations were in- volved, and under these conditions general aviation aircraft already appear to have a crash survival reserve not fully utili- zed. Accident studies have demonstrated, over a period of years, that an initial increase in the crash survivability record could be achieved without any further consideration being given to the energy -absorbing capabilities of the fuselage and seats, if only the upper torso of occupants could be restrained. Upper torso restraint appears to be the simplest, most practi- cal, and most effective initial crash survival improvement that can be incorporated. It was decided to initiate the NAFEC ABSTRACT A series of 22 dynamic tests was conducted on general avia- tion occupant restraint systems. These tests utilized lap belt, and lap belt/shoulder harness restraint systems. With the ex- ception of general aviation aircraft type certificated after Sep- tember 1969, the Federal Aviation Regulations require only lap belt restraint systems for emergency landing conditions. Based on the longitudinal deceleration/time response of an- thropomorphic dummy occupants, it was demonstrated that the lap belt/shoulder harness restraint systems offered occu- pants successful restraint at occupant inertia force levels sub- stantially above the current regulatory level. The tests, pre- liminary in nature, warranted continuation of the test program, in that the lap belt/shoulder harness restraint systems showed promise for regulatory inclusion, by virtue of the fact that results were achieved with restraint systems offered as options in recent years, requiring minimal weight increase with fuselage reinforcement adaptable to retrofit as well as new assembly. 1243</page><page sequence="2">1244 HECTOR DAIUTOLO general aviation crashworthiness program with a preliminary dynamic test program to first empirically, and quantitatively, demonstrate what has already long been observed more quali- tatively in general aviation crashes, namely, that serious to fatal impacts of the head and chest can be experienced by pilot and copilot occupants, even when pelvic decelerations indicate that occupants are experiencing inertia force levels in the regulatory range. A second, and more important, objec- tive was to determine whether upper torso restraint in the form of shoulder harnesses could be provided in a practical manner, requiring minimal weight increases, and with the cap- ability of restraining occupants at inertia force levels substan- tially above the regulatory level, taking greater advantage of human tolerance to severe injury resulting from decelerations. DESCRIPTION OF TESTS SCOPE - Overall guidance for the scope of the tests was provided by the fact that the tests were preliminary to the overall general aviation crashworthiness program. It was de- cided to keep the tests as simple as possible, including few parameters, so as not to obscure any trends that could appear in the test results. The following was decided: 1 . Only three restraint systems would be used on anthro- pomorphic dummy occupants. A lap belt, a lap belt/diagonal shoulder harness, and a lap belt/symmetrical shoulder harness restraint system. 2. The restraint systems would be installed in general avia- tion fuselages, utilizing only that portion of the fuselage which provides the protective envelope for the cabin area. Complete aircraft were not considered. 3. The test articles would be decelerated, as opposed to actually crashed, whereby the occupants would be subjected to inertia forces of an intensity which could occur in a crash. 4. Dynamic inputs would be held to the longitudinal direc- tion only, the direction for which the restraint systems are most effective. 5. The tests would be controlled, such that the instrument panel structure would provide the sole obstacle for pilot and copilot head and chest impacts. Occupant impact on the in- strument panel has been recognized as one of the primary causes of serious to fatal injuries in general aviation crashes. DYNAMIC TEST FACILITY - Tests were run at the NAFEC Catapult and Track Facility. Fig. 1 was taken at the arrest- Fig. 1 - NAFEC Catapult and Track Facility ment end of the track, with the catapult mechanism located under the shed in the background. The fuselage test article was mounted to the catapult car by a structural fixture with attachments at the engine mounts. The track is 300 ft long. The test article was activated by a pusher car connected to the catapult mechanism by a cable. The test article was accelera- ted to the desired velocity in the first 90 ft of track, after which it rolled free for the next 150 ft. It was then arrested to a stop by cables, over the desired arrestment distance. En- gagement velocity was measured just prior to arrestment. INSTRUMENTATION - Data were taken on 1 in magnetic tape utilizing 14 channels. The data can be divided into three categories- the dynamic input, the structural response, and the occupant/restraint system response. The engagement velocity and arrestment distance, both longitudinal measured the dy- namic input. The deceleration/time trace of the cabin floor measured the structural response, and can be considered the input to the occupant/restraint system. The occupant/re- straint system response was measured by deceleration/time traces over the dummy occupants and by force/time traces of the restraint system webbing. High-speed color motion pic- tures were taken of the tests. Camera speed was 500 frames/s with from 2-4 cameras mounted on the catapult car and 2 cameras mounted on tripods resting on the ground. TEST ARTICLES - The test articles consisted of four single- engine, 4-place general aviation fuselages. Two types were represented. Two fuselages were similar, and of a low wing type; two were similar, and of a high wing type. The fuselages were structurally complete from the engine firewall to a point beyond the cabin area, and all four seats were in place. One fuselage of each type was relegated to lap belt restraint system tests and one of each type to lap belt/shoulder harness re- straint system tests. Anthropomorphic dummy occupants were utilized. Two occupants, pilot and copilot, were used in the low wing fuselages. Four occupants were used in the high wing fuselages. Figs. 2 and 3 show the test articles. A tabulation of weights and occupant arrangement is shown in Table 1. Some variation in occupant seating arrangement was sought. RESTRAINT SYSTEMS - The minimum tensile strength of all fabric webbing in the restraint systems was 4000 lb. Lap Fig. 2 - Low wing fuselage mounted to catapult car</page><page sequence="3">GENERAL AVIATION OCCUPANT RESTRAINTS 1 245 belt assemblies, including webbing, buckle, adjuster, and end fittings, had a minimum tensile strength rating of 1 500 lb, in accordance with the Technical Standard Order (1)*. Three types of shoulder harnesses were utilized- diagonal, diagonal with inertia reel, and symmetrical with inertia reels. The iner- tia reels were utilized in the overhead mounting of the pilot and copilot harness assemblies only, one in the diagonal sys- tem, and two in the symmetrical system. Inertia reels had a minimum ultimate tensile strength of 2000 lb and locked at a webbing (strap) extension rate of 3 G. Overhead mounting *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper.

Diagonal harness straps were attached to the lap belts by a steel button which engaged a steel clip on the lap belt at the side of the occupant opposite the overhead attachment. The symmetrical harness straps were attached to the center of the lap belts by a quick release rotary buckle, which also received a centerline crotch strap. The lap belt/shoulder harness re- straint systems used were typical of those offered as options in general aviation aircraft in recent years. The end fittings of all lap belts, crotch straps, and shoulder harnesses were structure-mounted through single, high- strength, steel bolts. At the point of structural attachment all the strap assemblies fell approximately in a plane parallel to the centerline vertical plane of the fuselage. In the profile view, the strap assemblies formed angles with the horizontal, as shown in Table 2. The recommended geometrical configura- tions for restraint systems (2) were observed where possible. STRUCTURAL ATTACHMENTS, LOW WING FUSELAGE - The end fittings of the pilot and copilot lap belt assemblies were attached to an aluminum riveted bracket de- tail on the control alley inboard (Fig. 4), and on the fuselage skin outboard (Fig. 5). Bracket details were standard equip- ment. Additional overhead stiffening was used to receive the shoulder harnesses (Fig. 6). For the symmetrical harnesses, four 1-1/2 in-deep high-hat stringers of 0.040 in aluminum were riveted between the transverse frames bounding the pas- senger windows. Brackets of 0.125 in aluminum, which re- ceived the inertia reels, were bolted to both the stringers and the forward transverse frame. The shoulder harness for the diagonal systems was similarly supported, except that only two additional stringers were required and the high-hat sec- tion was made up by riveting a 1-1/2 in "Z" section of 0.040 in aluminum to the existing channel stringers, making up the upper window frame. The forward transverse frame was deepened by the addition of 1 in channel section of 0.062 in aluminum, bolted to the bottom flange of the existing frame, and further strengthened by the addition of a 2-1/2 in strip of 0.040 in aluminum plating, riveted to the fuselage skin above the frame. The frame reinforcement extends to a point about 4 in below the bottom frame of the windows.

Attachments for the rear passengers consisted of a common single, bolted detail on the floor at the centerline and a bolted bracket on the fuselage skin outboard (Fig. 8). For strengthening purposes, the latter bracket was replaced with a bracket of 0.125 in aluminum plating, otherwise all attachments were standard equipment. The overhead stiffening for the shoulder harnesses was fabricated from 0.125 in aluminum plating fastened to the fuselage structure with high strength steel bolts (Fig. 9).

The inertia reels for the pilot and copilot diagonal harness straps were bolted to a bracket on the upper aft corner of the door frame and above the passenger window frame. The end fittings of the diagonal harness straps for the rear passengers were bolted to a common centerline bracket mounted to the transverse frame behind the passenger seat. The outboard bracket connections behind the passenger windows, intended for an outboard shoulder strap mounting, were not utilized in the testing. TEST RESULTS GENERAL - A total of 22 dynamic tests were run in four different series, as outlined in Table 3. Dynamic inputs in- creased for a given restraint system as the tests within each series progressed. Damage to the fuselage, instrument panel, seats, restraint systems, and supporting structure was cumula- tive within each series, although instrument panels were re- paired after each occupant impact, and seats were repaired when necessary.

Data are given for the fuselage floor, the pilot, the pilot restraint system, the copilot and copilot restraint system, where necessary, and the occupant behind the copilot for the tests where rear passengers were used. The data pulses approx- imated triangular shapes. The pulses given for the fuselage floor apply over the entire test article arrestment. The pulses for the remaining data traces represent the most severe, or major, pulses experienced during arrestment. Pulses are described in the tables in terms of an instantaneous peak decel- eration or force, the time that it occurred after test article arrestment began, and the time duration of the pulse at the base line. Where two pulses are noted for an occupant data trace, the first relates to restraint, the second to instrument panel impact. The directions of the occupant decelerations were taken with respect to the reference axes of the dummies. The key parameter with which the tests were monitored was the peak pelvic deceleration of the pilot. The Federal Avia- tion Regulations, Part 23 (3), call for successful restraint of occupants in general aviation aircraft for emergency landing conditions in which 170 lb occupants experience a longi- tudinal inertia force of 9 G. This force is further augmented by a fitting factor of 1.33 on the restraint system attachment fittings, which, in effect, raises the inertia level to 12 G. Al- though there are no dynamic test criteria as such in the regulations, peak pelvic decelerations of 12 G on the pilot were considered to represent the regulatory level for the pur- poses of the tests. Testing was generally kept at, or above, this level. No vertical or lateral requirements were considered since all the testing was in the longitudinal direction. Tests were discontinued when either restraint system failure was obtained or "serious" to "fatal" injuries were experienced by the pilot and copilot dummies. LOW WING FUSELAGE - A typical setup for the lap belt restraint system tests is shown in Fig. 2. The dummy upset after arrestment, corresponding to the test data of Table 4, is shown in Fig. 10. Engagement velocity and arrestment distance were 71 mph and 32 ft, respectively. The decelera- tion pulse at the cabin floor, measuring the fuselage response, had a base line duration of 0.650 s, and an instantaneous peak of 8 G. Pilot and copilot foreheads experienced impact with Fig. 10 - Dummy upset, lap belt test, low wing fuselage the instrument panel, as noted in the high-speed films. En- gagement of the heads in the panel is evident in the photo- graph of the instrument panel damage (Fig. 1 1). Other than slight wrinkling of the fuselage skin between the firewall and windshield posts, no other visible damage was sustained in the fuselage or restraint system. The pilot pelvis experienced a longitudinal deceleration pulse of 0.007 s base duration with a peak of 14 G; the pilot head experienced an impact pulse of 0.015 s base duration with a 130 G peak, longitudinal, and of 0.01 1 s base duration and 45 G peak, vertical. The tests demonstrated that head impacts in the serious to fatal range (4) can be experienced by pilot and copilot occupants, when subjected to dynamic inputs, even though the peak pelvic decelerations are held within the regulatory range. A typical test setup for the lap belt/symmetrical shoulder harness restraint system tests is shown in Fig. 12.

Occupant restraint was success- ful. High-speed films showed the longitudinal shoulder move- ment to be about 6 in. Although dynamic inputs and pelvic responses were somewhat higher than those in the lap belt restraint system tests, the occupant heads experienced no instrument panel impact. The pilot head experienced a deceleration pulse of 0.560 s base duration with a 10 G peak, longitudinal, and of 0.560 s base duration with a 19 G peak, vertical. Fuselage damage was slight. The dummy upset after arrestment, corresponding to the test data of Table 6, is shown in Fig. 14. Engagement velocity and arrestment distance were 70mph and 10 ft, respectively. The fuselage response showed a 0.300 s base duration and a 25 G peak. Restraint of pilot was successful. Restraint of the copilot was partially successful, in that momentary restraint was obtained to the extent that head impact with the instru- ment panel was prevented, after which the copilot lap belt ruptured in two places, and the copilot's legs impacted the firewall.

The restraint system demonstrated the capability of taking advantage of human tolerance against severe injury resulting from decelerations (5). Considering the decelerations in Table 6, and the fact that the copilot dummy weighed 200 lb as opposed to 170 lb for the pilot, it would be expected that lap belt and shoulder harness forces for the copilot were in the general range of those shown for the pilot. Channels were not available for instrumenting the copilot restraint system. A typical test setup for the lap belt/diagonal shoulder harness restraint system tests is shown in Fig. 16. The dummy upset after arrestment, corresponding to the test data of Table 7, is shown in Fig. 17. Occupant restraint was success- ful. The greater forward lean of the pilot resulted from slack which entered into the harness system during the acceleration phase of the tests. The data of Table 7 indicate that the results were similar to the lap belt/ symmetrical shoulder harness tests run at comparable input (Table 5). The dummy upset after arrestment, corresponding to the test data of Table 8, is shown in Fig. 18. Engagement velocity and arrestment distance were 70mph and 13 ft, respectively.

Restraint of pilot and copilot was not successful. Each inboard lap belt attachment fitting, an aluminum yoke, failed in tension, releasing the occupants which then collided with the instrument panel. The inboard fitting, by virtue of the diagonal harness attaching on that side, received a greater load than the outboard fitting (Table 8). A detail of the fitting failure can be seen in Fig. 19. Damage to the fuselage, previously sustained in the symmet- rical shoulder harness tests, progressed. Damage to the fuselage between the instrument panel and the firewall was severe as a result of occupant impact with the instrument panel (Fig. 18). Note that during momentary restraint (first set of pulses, Table 8) pilot and copilot did not achieve the deceleration levels in the head and chest that were experienced in the similar symmetrical harness test (Table 6). Throughout all the testing utilizing the low wing fuselage, no visible damage was sustained in the pilot or copilot seats. A detail of the seat is shown in Fig. 20. Note the pins on each of the forward legs for adjustment of the seat position in the deck tracks. This feature of dual pins enabled the seat to react to occupant inertia forces symmetrically. Fig. 21 shows the pilot seat in place on the deck tracks. HIGH WING FUSELAGE - Test results on the restraint systems utilizing the high wing fuselage were generally similar to those obtained utilizing the low wing fuselage.

The dummy upset after arrestment, corresponding to the test data of Table 10, is shown in Fig. 26. Occupant restraint was successful although qualified for the rear passengers, since the dummies began to slip out of the restraint system from below the lap belt. Two factors concerning restraint system geometry contributed to the partial release of the rear passengers. First, the point of attachment of the shoulder harness to the lap belt was not as outboard, nor as low, as desired, due to lack of clearance between the passenger and the fuselage skin and between the passenger seat and the fuselage skin. Second, a more forward location of the lap belt anchorage would have been desirable so that the hip area of the occupant could have been better contained by the restraint system (6). The rear passengers were removed before further testing since occupant release was anticipated as the dynamic inputs increased. The dummy upset after arrestment, corresponding to the test data of Table 1 1, is shown in Figs. 27 and 28. Restraint of pilot and copilot was not successful. Heads struck the instrument panel. The pilot lap belt released as a result of tensile failure of the bolts making up the structural connec- tion of deck bracket to deck plating; Fig. 7 shows the connec- tion intact. Data on the copilot were less significant since the outboard shoulder harness released from the rotary buckle during the acceleration phase of the tests resulting in an in- complete restraint system.

The lap belt webbing subsequently ruptured on the outboard side. Both pilot and copilot seats slid forward, with the forward legs leaving the deck tracks (Fig. 28). This behavior was due, at least in part, to the fact that each seat engaged one deck track on the left side, with a pin connection for seat position adjustment; note detail (Fig. 29). The result was unsymmetrical reaction of the seat to occupant inertia forces. Failure was obtained in the forward left leg of the pilot seat as it struck the bottom of the door frame while moving forward. Note the rupture in the cast aluminum part (Fig. 30).

The instrument panel and pilot seat were repaired, after which testing continued. A typical test setup for the lap belt/diagonal shoulder harness restraint system tests is shown in Figs. 31 and 32. The dummy upset after arrestment, corresponding to the test data of Table 12, is shown in Fig. 33. Occupant restraint was successful. Figs. 34 and 35 show the dummy upset after arrestment, corresponding to the test data of Table 13. Occupant restraint was not successful. The inboard lap belt attachment fitting again failed in tension, as it had in the low wing fuselage tests, releasing the occupants which then collided with the instru- ment panel. Fig. 36 shows that the pilot seat partially left the deck tracks and that the copilot seat completely left the deck tracks. SUMMARY Based on the deceleration/ time response of anthropomorphic dummy occupants, the dynamic tests on general aviation occupant restraint systems demonstrated the following: 1. In the lap belt restraint system tests, serious to fatal head impacts were experienced by pilot and copilot, even though pelvic decelerations were held to the regulatory range. The slight damage to the fuselage and seats, sustained in these tests, corresponds to the results noted in crashes where longitudinal decelerations predominate, namely, that under these conditions general aviation aircraft possess a crash survival reserve, at present not fully utilized. 2. In the lap belt/ shoulder harness restraint system tests, restraint systems of the type offered as options in recent years had the capability of restraining pilot and copilot occupants at inertia force levels substantially above the regulatory level, taking greater advantage of human tolerance to severe injury resulting from decelerations. 3. Based on a symmetrical shoulder harness restraint system for pilot and copilot occupants, the weight increase was 5 lb/ occupant for the low wing fuselage, and 2.5 lb/occupant for the high wing fuselage. The addition of each inertia reel and shoulder strap added about 1 lb (a total of 2 lb/occupant) to the restraint system, the remaining weight being relegated to structural attachments and reinforcement. Considering the useful load of these aircraft to be about 1000 lb, the useful load decrease per occupant was 0.50% for the low wing air- craft, and 0.25% for the high wing aircraft. 4. The structural reinforcement utilized in both types of fuselages may be readily adaptable to new assembly, but somewhat less so in the case of retrofit, particularly for the low wing fuselage as a result of the extent of the reinforce- ment. The test results provided optimism along these lines, however, in that no visible evidence of structural failure was noted in the reinforcement and the surrounding fuselage skin. Test plans for the current year call for a sizable reduction in the reinforcement, including elimination of the deepened transverse frame. 5. The lap belt assembly proved to be the weak link in the shoulder harness restraint systems. Improved restraint is dependent upon a strengthening of the lap belt assembly. In an attempt to extend somewhat beyond the limitations of the subject dynamic tests, test plans for the current year, utilizing pilot and copilot occupants, include these factors: 1. Only symmetrical shoulder harnesses are being used since long range plans call for the introduction of lateral loads. 2. Lap belt assemblies have a minimum rated tensile strength of 3000 lb, and a minimum initial webbing tensile strength of 6000 lb. In the subject tests, the values were 1500 and 4000 lb, respectively.</page><page sequence="16">1 258 HECTOR DAIUTOLO 3 . Pilot and copilot occupants are both 95th percentile dummies as opposed to one 95th percentile and one 50th percentile in the subject tests. This will provide both uni- formity and compatibility of test results with current specification trends (6). 4. Similar occupant deceleration peaks are sought, but the input pulses (deceleration/ time pulses of the fuselage floor) are being shortened considerably, requiring lower engagement velocities and shorter arrestment distances. Engagement velocities in the general range of 35 mph with 4 ft arrestment distances are being utilized. Initial input pulses start at a 20 G peak, with a 0.16 s base duration, the peak continuing on upward. These shorter pulses are comparable to current specification trends and, moreover, more analogous to phenomena observed concerning the crash path in the after- math of accidents. Often there are several short local gouges in the earth, along the crash path, where velocity losses occurred in parts over short time periods. In the tests covered by the paper, engagement velocities used were in the range of the takeoff and landing speeds of the aircraft, resulting in the total arrestment being analogous to a more uniform crash path, consisting of a single, less abrupt, gouge. 5. Instrumentation capabilities at the Catapult and Track Facility have been extended to 28 channels, enabling the dummies to be instrumented more uniformly. Future test plans anticipate the introduction of vertical and lateral loads, acting simultaneously with the longitudinal loads, along with the reintroduction of the rear passengers. this point, the tests will have advanced beyond the preliminary stage, in that the fuselage will be subjected to its full com- plement of inertia forces, similar to what would be exper- ienced in an actual crash. Likewise, introduction of the vertical loads will highlight the role of the seat as part of the restraint system, whereby its strength, failure mode, and energy-absorbing characteristics will be brought into play. Moreover, collapse of the seat in structure-mounted restraint systems, as opposed to seat-mounted restraint systems, alters the restraint system geometry, encouraging release of the occupant from below the lap belt. To summarize, the test program is advancing, by steps, to full tridirectional tests which are expected to provide an opportunity to observe the behavior, and assess the effectiveness, of general aviation occupant restraint systems under conditions similar to an actual crash.
