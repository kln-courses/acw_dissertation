<plain_text><page sequence="1">Devouring Perspectives: On Cannibal Shamans in Siberia CHARLES STEPANOFF École pratique des hautes études, Paris charles.stepanoff@ephe.sorbonne.fr ABSTRACT Throughout Siberia, shamans are suspected of 'devouring' other humans. This article, based on ethnographic literature about Siberian peoples and on fieldwork conducted in Tuva, examines different theoretical interpretations of this concep tion. A 'perspectivist' approach explains that shamans become cannibal because they see humans as prey animals. The paradoxes of this interpretation lead to a critical discussion of the philosophical premises of the perspectivist theory. Another approach is then proposed: Siberian traditions demonstrate two distinct understandings of the kinds of body connected with different pragmatic contexts. Legendary narratives elaborate a definition of the body by its position in an inter action. The logic of practices is ruled by distinctly more essentialist schemas. The theme of shamans' cannibalism contributes convincingly to broader hypotheses about the internal properties of the shamanic bodies which are necessary to their ritual practices. Keywords: shamanism, perspectivism, ritual relations, psychological essen tialism, Siberia Recent developments in studies on North Asian religious practices and concep tions are striking for their philosophical orientation. Abstract conceptualisation is not something new in this domain, but never before have philosophers been in such demand as references to interpret Mongolian and Siberian traditions. This new ten dency, which is quite general in anthropology, constitutes an appreciable break with the claims expressed in the last decade to 'recontextualize shamanic activi ties' (Thomas &amp; Humphrey 1994). At that time the objective was to denounce 'essentialist' attempts, represented by Eliade, to display what is 'properly shamanic'. Today, the requirements of historical and social context seem less urgent than the interest in theoretical insights expected to be valid over a wider area and for a longer period. The notions of 'social contradictions', 'historical processes' or 'political dimension' are now noticeably overshadowed by those of 'immanence', 'transcendence', 'cosmology', 'ontology'. Inner Asia 11 (2009): 283-307 © 2009 Global Oriental Ltd</page><page sequence="2">284 CHARLES STEPANOFF Doubtless the recent increase in abstract conceptualisations reveals that the earlier scepticism has left some issues unresolved. Beyond incontestable changes and inventive adaptations, one must recognise some even more striking consis tencies observed in discourses and ritual practices. Deep principles remain, allowing anthropologists to name distant phenomena, though recognised as dif ferent, as 'shamanism'. In this paper I will examine some modest but highly widespread facts in order to contribute to the picture of North Asian shamanism. In all of Siberia, as in many places where shamanism is usually identified, shamans are suspected of 'devouring' other humans. I will first consider the interpretation of this global feature through a global anthropological theory, the influential 'Amerindian per spectivism'. It will provide the occasion to open a general discussion about the perspectivist approach. An earlier special issue of Inner Asia] provided an engaging overview of the possibility of an 'Inner Asian perspectivism'. The intel lectual stimulus of this experience is critical for North Asian studies. However, my argument is that, despite different readjustments, the historical roots of per spectivist theory in western metaphysics, namely idealism, make it hardly adaptable to exotic climates. Idealism is 'an old and respectable philosophical doctrine' (Gell 1999: 32), which claims that there is nothing like the 'real' existing independently from its perceptual or intellectual representations. Traditionally, idealism is opposed to realism, which idealists consider 'naive'. Realism postulates the existence of the real that I define simply in the following way: the real is what can refute our representations and lead us to correct our point of view (see Descombes 1995). Idealism, though not historically spread among native conceptions, is known in North Asia as a logical possibility. However I will argue that Siberian peoples do not subscribe to this way of thinking, but ascribe it to spirits. Therefore, though being quite fascinating, perspectivism turns out to have little explanatory power for the anthropological analysis of native Siberian conceptions, which are realist.2 I will suggest another interpretation of 'shamanic cannibalism' which con trasts different positions within interactions rather than different perspectives. Cannibalism will be integrated with the relational context of ritual practice. My hypothesis is that in Siberia subjective perceptions, which are enhanced in per spectivist theory, are seen as mere secondary effects of objective relations based on position and on causality. Both causal and positional relations insert their relata into a background which is common and independent from them. Consequently, the Siberian understanding of relations requires the existence of a common world (philosophical realism). Exploring the principles underlying the opposition between shamans and laymen, I will show that the circulation of vital energy, expressed in the idiom of consumption, is rooted in an essentialist hypothesis about the causal powers of shamans' bodies.</page><page sequence="3">DEVOURING PERSPECTIVES 285 ANTHROPOPHAGOUS SPIRITS One of the most stable ideas about spirits in North Asia is that they are endowed with a huge appetite. The Chukchi description of kély" spirits as 'gaping mouths' in the Arctic (Bogoras 1904-1910:295) strongly reminds one of the exclamation of a Mongolian Darkhat woman about an ongon spirit: 'what a big mouth you have!' (Potanin 1883: 88-9). Humankind is supposed to become the ordinary victim of this appetite. At the beginning of the twentieth century, most of diseases and deaths in Siberia were ascribed to the appetite of the spirits. According to Koryaks, the spirit called kala Tikes human liver particularly well' (Jochelson 1905-1908: 102), while the Chukchi kély 'is fond of liver' (Bogoras 1904-1910: 295). Yukaghir harmful spirits had the same reputation: 'They enter men and eat their internal organs, thus causing all kinds of diseases' (Jochelson 1926: 237). Far in the South, Altaians said about an ill person that 'a körmös spirit is eating him' (Anokhin 1924:6). It is worth noticing that eating people is not ascribed to a particular variety of 'evil spirits': both Chukchi kély and Altaian körmös also usu ally designate shaman's auxiliary spirits. On the victim's side, what is eaten is a vital element, like an organ or the soul. Sometimes the bites of spirits leave more external marks: such as swellings and sores for Koryaks (Jochelson 1905-1908: 28), or wounds for Altaians (one said 'a spirit bit him', Anokhin 1924: 6). Among North Siberian peoples, the spirits' anthropophagy is specifically described in terms of a hunt where spirits are hunters and humans are game. Hamayon (1990) explains these representations as a feature of what she calls 'hunting shamanism', where the relationship between humans and the superna ture is founded on reciprocity in the exchange of meat. As Hamayon puts it: 'this circulation of flesh between worlds throws light on the idea that humans are the spoils of spirits' hunting as reindeer are the spoils of humans' (1990: 414). Reciprocity in exchange implies the reversibility of positions in hunting. THE PERSPECTIVIST HYPOTHESIS Pedersen interprets the hunting idiom differently, as an occurrence of 'perspec tivism' as theorized by Viveiros de Castro (Pedersen 2001). Amerindian perspectivism, in its canonical formula expressed by Viveiros de Castro (1998: 470), is strongly connected to hunting: Humans see humans as humans, animals as animals and spirits (if they see them) as spirits; however animals (predators) and spirits see humans as animals (as prey) to the same extent that animals (as prey) see humans as spirits or as animals (predators). By the same token, animals and spirits see themselves as humans (...) A more abstract formula of perspectivism, according to Pedersen, would be that 'the Other will see itself as human, and thus humans as Others'. Pedersen, after establishing the importance of animism in North Siberia, examines the presence</page><page sequence="4">286 CHARLES STEPANOFF of a perspectivist thinking. He provides two citations from Bogoras (1904-1910: 294-5) about the Chukchi. In the first example, kély spirits are described as driving a reindeer sledge: if they encounter a human shaman their reindeer stop but the kély cannot see the shaman. In the second citation, we learn that kély live like humans in villages and practise hunting. 'The object of their hunts is exclu sively man, whom they usually call "a little seal".' In a perspectivist way, one can say that, for Chukchi, Others see themselves as humans and see humans as Others. For Pedersen, these examples demonstrate that perspectivism does exist in North Asia, although he suggests that it is found in a 'pure' form only in Northern North Asia (Pedersen 2001: 421). Pedersen's stimulating analysis leads one to reconsider classical ethno graphic sources about Siberian peoples in a new light. I would like to suggest that many other 'perspectivist' materials can be found throughout Siberia, and not only in the North. The reversibility of the domestic/savage categories is a well known theme among Altai-Sayan peoples (South Siberia). Altaian informants of Anokhin explained to him that wolves, when howling, invoke the heavenly divinity Kudai, begging him to give them cattle.4 Thus wolves are just like hunters who make an invocation to receive luck and humans' cattle are the wolves' game animals. Moreover, for all the Turkic peoples of Altai-Sayan massif, game animals (ap) are held to be the cattle (mal) of master-spirits of the forests. In the hunting stories of contemporary Tuvan hunters, the animal that men call 'maral-stag' (syyn) the master-spirit calls 'bull' (buga), and similar facts have been recently recorded in Altai by Broz (2007) and among Dukha by Kristensen (2007:277). In this way, the difference between nature (wild) and cul ture (domestic) is severely challenged: an important consequence of perspectivism according to Viveiros de Castro. Similarly to Amerindian myths quoted as illustrations of perspectivism, many myths collected among Turco Mongolian populations of South Siberia present animals as former humans: the bear was originally a man who got angry and became a bear; the marmot was an archer; the cuckoo a girl; the capercaillie a rough man and so on (e.g. Potanin 1883: 167-9; Verbickii 1893:137; Bawden 2003: 535-6). In short, there is a great deal of material for perspectivist analysis in Siberia. How will this theory manage our cannibal shamans? CANNIBAL SHAMANS It is difficult not to connect representations about spirits eating people with can nibal tendencies frequently ascribed to shamans. Tuvans often told me that shamans can 'bite and eat people' (kizhiniyzyryptar chipter). These are not myths about a remote past: a shaman proudly claimed to me to have himself 'eaten' sev eral people, but not yet enough, he recognized, to be called a 'great shaman'. Of course this is an invisible kind of cannibalism: shamans are suspected, for example, after an unexpected death difficult to explain otherwise. In Tuvan</page><page sequence="5">DEVOURING PERSPECTIVES 287 reports, humans eaten by shamans are mostly rival shamans in stereotypical duels called chizhirkham [shamans devouring each other: chi- 'to eat' and suffix -zh- 'each other']. The Mongolian equivalent of this expression is idelce- (ide- 'to eat' and suffix -Ic- 'each other') (Chagdarsürüng 1994: 153). The Darkhats have stories about shamans eating people (Dulam &amp; Even 1994:139), ancient Buryats supposedly killed their anthropophagous shamans (Hamayon 1990: 417) and Yakut traditions are rich in shamans eating human hearts and livers and muti lating people (Nikolaev 1961: 48). Among Tungus populations, according to Delaby (1976: 222), all shamans are supposed to be able to eat human souls, so that there is nothing like the categories of 'good' and 'evil' shamans. For example, Oroch attributed the reduction of their population in the 1920s to the appetite of their shamans (Avrorin &amp; Koz'minskii 1949: 325). The same is recorded in North Siberia: Bogoras notices that 'instances of the swallowing of souls and bodies of men by shamans frequently occur in Chukchi tales' (1904— 1910:465). Generally, the shaman is said to eat the soul or raw blood and organs of his victim: 'I drink your warm blood' says a Khakas shaman to his Tuvan enemy (Butanaev 2006: 100). This consumption of uncooked blood and flesh clearly dehumanises the shaman and identifies him with a predatory animal.5 Perspectivism seems to offer here a particularly convenient theoretical frame to interpret such conceptions. In this theory, the shamans' cmcial role in relations with non-humans is explained in that 'they alone are capable of assuming the point of view of such beings and, in particular, are capable of returning to tell the tale' (Viveiros de Castro 1998:472). Pedersen's definition is similar: 'Basically, a shaman can be defined as a human person with the double ability to gain the per spective of another person, be that human or nonhuman, and then return un-transformed to his or her former state' (2001: 423). Then, relative to our can nibal shamans, the conclusion arises self-evidently: having adopted the spirits' vision, shamans see people as prey animals instead of seeing them as humans. This interpretation has been defended by Fausto in a recent analysis of very sim ilar facts in Amazonia. As he puts it: 'The shaman's ambivalence stems from his serving, in person, as a point of articulation between his perspective and that of his ferocious familiar spirits.' Fausto provides, as a manifestation of this 'sharing of perspectives', the striking example of Amazonian shaman-jaguar metamor phosis: 'were-jaguar of this kind eat people, which appear to them as peccary' (Wilbert quoted by Fausto, 2004: 171). Cannibalism results thus from a very peculiar kind of sight trouble. Where does this shaman's perspectival instability come from? An important axiom of Viveiros de Castro's theory is that each perspective is embedded in a specific body. Indeed, animistic mythologies ascribe a particular perspective to each species; yet in animism all living beings possess the same kind of soul; therefore the only locus of differentiation between them is the body. The conse quence is an embodiment of perspectives: changing one's perspective is changing one's body, and vice versa. This explains why the shaman's exchange</page><page sequence="6">288 CHARLES STÉPANOFF of perspective is correlated with a metamorphosis (exchange of body). Pedersen has developed a highly elaborated and suggestive reflection about the conse quences of these principles in understandings of shamanic accessories in North Asia. He explains that the 'perspectival exchange' practised by the shaman is inaccessible to laymen because it 'requires much preparation and special equip ment' (Pedersen 2007b: 323). The shamanic costume is construed as an 'ontological tool' which, by providing the shaman with a multiple body, enables him to reach different perspectives (Pedersen 2007a). THE PERSPECTIVIST PARADOX The logic of perspectivist argumentation seems difficult to counter, and we should certainly be satisfied, if only a tricky paradox did not appear. Anthropologists give evidence of a 'perspectivist thinking' among the people of a society by quoting narratives which describe the world from the points of view of spirits and animals. Of course, these myths are communicated to anthropologists not by non-humans themselves but by people, often by lay people and not only shamans, for myths belong to a shared knowledge. The thought experience of perspectivism (considering non-human perspectives) can be assumed by any body who tells the myth or merely understands it. As for seeing people as prey, it is not an experience peculiar to spirits and shamans: it is on the contrary a universal terrifying knowledge. Among Chukchi when a man was ill, he was abandoned to death by his relatives because they saw him as the prey of kély (Bogoras 1904-1910: 460). It is clear that, in pre-Soviet Siberia, people did see themselves as prey; nevertheless they did not expect, from this cruel 'vision', to become spirits or shaman-like, nor did they feel compelled to practise cannibalism. Thus, strangely, the non-human perspective according to which humans are prey appears to be quite accessible to humans and, so to speak, not point-of-view dependant. This paradox is not a subsidiary one; it is intrinsic to perspectivism: the enun ciation of the content of different perspectives, which is necessary to any formulation of perspectivist conceptions, by itself demonstrates that perspectives can be taken up without bodily change. Saying that spirits see things in such and such a way, one describes the world from a spirit's point of view, although one is not a spirit. Since they are conveyed by human traditions, it is self-evident for anybody that non-human perspectives are not rigidly attached to a non-human body. In Siberia, accounts of non-humans' visions are not given specifically by shamans but rather by storytellers describing spirits' villages and spirits hunting humans Therefore access to non-human perspectives can hardly be the defining feature of the shaman. Further we will have to 1) identify the origin of the perspectivist par adox; and 2) find another explanation of the persistent idea that shamans are cannibals.</page><page sequence="7">DEVOURING PERSPECTIVES 289 ONTOLOGISING RELATIONS To resolve the first point, let us come back to prey/predator relations, since Viveiros de Castro insists that 'one of the central dimensions, possibly even the fundamental dimension, ofperspectival inversions refers to the relative and rela tional statuses of predator and prey' (1998: 471). I do not think that Siberian narratives about non-human perspectives aim to express a contradiction between a human point of view in which humans are predators and a spirit's point of view where humans are prey. Siberians do consider that they are spirits' prey from any point of view, for death is not a perspective-dependent event. The fact that Siberians are also predators does not express a different standpoint but describes another empirical relation: the interaction between humans and game-animals. Here it is important clearly to distinguish a point of view and a position in a rela tion. The notions of prey and predator are relational (one is not a prey per se but in relation to a predator, and reciprocally), but this does not mean that the posi tions of prey and predator in the relation are perspective-dependent. My predator sees me as prey as I see myself as its prey. The accumulation of relations implies an addition of roles assumed by one and the same being. A man can be both father (of his son) and son (of his father): these relations do not contradict each other. It would be rather strange to claim that, as my son sees me as a father and my father as a son, it remains undecidable whether I am &amp; father or a son. Obviously the mistake of such a reasoning is to take relational terms as ontological predicates. My impression is that perspec tivist theory is not exempt from such an ontologisation. In this regard, the predilection for the term 'ontology' is revealing of a tendency to focus on onto logical representations ('what things are in themselves'), and to ignore relational conceptions ('how things are related'). This ontological shift leads perspectivist theory to reconcile the 'being-father' and the 'being-son' by postulating the exis tence of two separate worlds, one where I am a father, and another where I am a son. Beyond these opposite universes no common reality is expected to be found: this is the principal metaphysical claim of 'multinaturalism' made by Viveiros de Castro. In Siberia, such a tendency to onto-idealist climbing is not encountered: it is not a problem to be both father and son, or to be both prey and predator. Chukchi narratives rather constitute a reflection about relations, namely relations of rela tions, which a classical structural formula suffices to note: [man: seal]:: [ke'le: man] Which means: the relation between man and seal is comparable to the relation between spirit and man. Likewise, if we take a famous Amazonian 'perspectivist' exemplum: [man: beer]:: [jaguar: blood]</page><page sequence="8">290 CHARLES STEPANOFF The relation between jaguar and blood is comparable to the relation between man and beer. A general formulation of these perspectivist stories would be: [man : man's prey]:: [man's predator: man] Doubtless, the expression of non-human perspectives is simply the best way to underline such relations. CAN SPECIES BE RELATIONAL TERMS? It could be objected that perspectivism's canonical formula is not 'spirits see humans as prey' but 'spirits see humans as animals (as prey)'. Viveiros de Castro forestalled our contestation by an important precision: 'this "to see as" refers lit erally to perceptions and not analogically to concepts' (1998: 470). Indeed it is necessary to distinguish a perspective, which is 'located in the body', from an intellectual representation, 'a property of the mind or spirit' (1998: 478). So the intellectual representation of humans as prey may be widespread among ordinary people: this does not contradict the perspectivist assumption that the perception of humans as animals is embedded in non-human bodies. Indeed, in the Chukchi example, it is not just said that kély call people their prey (a conceptual representation), but 'seals' (which suggests a sensible percep tion). Unlike prey, seal can hardly be considered as a relational concept and it seems obvious that it is a 'natural kind term' (as defined by Putnam 1975). There is no reason to suppose that the common principles of 'folk-biology', considered by cognitive psychologists as characterising human understanding of animals (Atran 1990), are not shared in Siberia. Like everyone else, Siberian hunters and breeders roughly expect that members of a species share the same behaviour, ali mentation and anatomical constitution. It means that, beyond individual variations, people attribute to all members of a species an underlying feature which makes them similar. This 'essentialist' conception permits one to antici pate the actions of an animal whose species is known, which is obviously crucial in hunting as in breeding. However, I will try to suggest that, besides this ordinary practical knowledge, some Siberian narratives elaborate rather disconcerting conceptions, in which species terms like seal can effectively appear as relational terms. Here it is fun damental to keep in mind the distinction between practical and mythical knowledge, the latter being often deliberately paradoxical in relation to the former. In his time, Shirokogoroff had already criticised the ethnographic ten dency to attribute a mystical world-view to Siberians by ignoring this distinction. He remarked that the 'folkloric' and 'religious' complex 'cannot be identified with the general positive knowledge of ethnical units [groups]'. He humorously added: 'No one would believe that it is possible to formulate the idea of the Englishman of the 17th century about natural phenomena by studying Milton's</page><page sequence="9">DEVOURING PERSPECTIVES 291 poetry. Why shall we do it with Tungus?' (1935: 73) Among Tungus, hunting techniques and story telling are different pragmatic contexts which involve het erogeneous kinds of knowledge. Conscious that it is counter-intuitive, let us imagine what could be a non essentialist, a relational apprehension of species. Viveiros de Castro has opened the road, demonstrating the existence in Amazonia of a relational understanding of a particular species, humankind. For that, he provided a powerful tool, the idea of 'cosmological deixis' - which seems to have remained less commentated upon than the perspectivist aspect of his theory. Viveiros de Castro notices that Amazonian self-ethnonyms, usually trans lated as 'humans', are pragmatically used as pronouns rather than nouns. These names are not a designation of humankind as a species; their signification is rather 'we, people/us'. Thus the animic attribution of this self-designation to ani mals is not anthropocentrism, but the recognition of their position as subjects. He goes further: even the 'human bodily form', by which non-humans are said to apprehend themselves, functions as a 'deictic', for it is the form by which any subject apprehends himself (1998:476-7). However, Viveiros de Castro does not extend this compelling analysis to non human species, and his general definition of the body remains a non-relational one: 'a bundle of affects and capacities' (1998: 478). Indeed it is necessary to keep a minimally substantial and closed notion of the body for the crucial per spectivist axiom 'the point of view is in the body' to make any sense. Here I would suggest that it is logically possible to understand animal bodies in the same way as human ones: as deictics, i.e. indications about a contextual sit uation. For example, what would it mean when being seal-bodied refers to a context? In the Maritime Chukchi culture, a seal is a prey belonging to another world than its predator (i.e. to the sea) and constituting the most important part of this predator's diet (see Bogoras 1904—1910: 115). Such a definition exactly applies to the situation of humans with respect to kély, so there is no longer any need to be surprised, with this relational definition, that 'kély call humans seal'. This radically relational understanding of species and their bodies is out standingly exemplified in the tradition of the Nivkhs, a people inhabiting Northern Sakhalin and the Amur River estuary. Their self-designation is a perfect illustration of Viveiros de Castro's deictical theory: nivkh, usually glossed in ethnography as 'human', is in fact composed from n 'i [I] and vo [village], so that a literal translation would be 'those of my village'. These who have their villages in the mountain are consequently called pal nivkh [people of the mountain], which is par excellence the designation of bears (Beffa 1982: 16-17). A Nivkh tale reports the adventures of a man who, travelling among unknown countries, is caught by spirits, bound and taken away to their home. He is held on the platform where Nivkhs usually keep a bear they will kill. The spirits' chief orders: 'Servant, tease the bear.' Everything in the spirits' attitude indicates that the man will be killed in the ritual fashion by which Nivkhs, kill bears. The man himself growls and stands up 'as a bear'. There is no information in this tale about the</page><page sequence="10">292 CHARLES STEPANOFF characters' perceptions, but only description of their gestures and words (Beffa 1982:21-3). The object of the tale is not the content of the spirits' perception in contrast to that of the humans (it is not said that they see the man as a big hairy animal), but the very fact that, because of the position he reached, in his relation with spirits and in the home space (the bear platform), the traveller literally becomes a bear, if only we understand bear in a relational sense. This episode shows that a gloss of bear among Nivkhs could be something like: a respected prey captured and kept alive at home, for whom the predators make a collective ritual play before killing him. The fact that the hero 'is a bear', in this particular meaning, is not perspective-dependent, for he is not less perceived as such by himself than by spirits. On the contrary, this positional definition presupposes a common inde pendent background which the players fit into: the home space. We will see that the positional approach is widely applied to spirits in Siberia. POSITIONAL DEFINITION OF BEING A SPIRIT When I asked a Tuvan hunter of the Süt-Khöl region about the harmful spirits called aza, usually considered as man killers, he gave me a quite disconcerting answer: he said that they are not dangerous at all (khora chok). 'The aza fear humans. Being blind, they try not to step on simple people like us. They flee themselves' (Aza kizhiden korgar. Bis yshkash bödüün kizhilerni sogur azalar kizhi-daa bazyp kaaptain. Bisten bottary dezip marjnazhyp). This is the first time I had heard such statements: usually, on the contrary, it is said that humans fear aza, because they cannot see them. In fact, I presume now that this hunter was thinking about very specific kinds of relations between aza and humans: those which take place in the aza realm. One of the most beautiful expressions of Siberian concern for non-human per spectives is the widespread tale about a human going into the spirits' world. Different versions have been identified among every linguistic family in Siberia from Nganasan in the Arctic to Dukha living in Mongolia (for an overview, see Nekliudov &amp; Novik, forthcoming). The framework of the tale is impressively stable: one man comes by chance in the world of spirits (inferior, superior, or other) through a hole or a cave. He encounters a camp where people can not see him and step on him, just as my Tuvan informant said. Only dogs notice him and bark. When the man touches people and when he teases girls, they fall ill. He gradually understands that he is among spirits and that he is a spirit for them. Suspecting the presence of the man, which they call an 'harmful spirit', spirits invite their shaman who performs a ritual and expels the man toward the humans' hearth. This narrative proposes a purely non-essentialist and positional interpretation of what it can mean 'to be a spirit'. Here the hero becomes an 'harmful spirit' not by a change of his intrinsic nature, nor because of his evil intentions, but by a</page><page sequence="11">DEVOURING PERSPECTIVES 293 mere moving in the space. In this context 'to be a spirit' means to find oneself in a radically foreign environment. This definition is consistent with Vaté's detailed analysis of the notion of kély in the Chukchi representations: she convincingly argues that 'kély are not, strictly speaking, malevolent beings, but represent a cer tain kind of otherness. They are the nonhumans par excellence as being outside "human" or domestic fire areas' (2007: 229). The tale radicalises this positional apprehension in showing that an inversion of positions in space entails an inver sion of roles in relations and, therefore, of identities. We have seen that prey and predator are not mutually exclusive ontological predications. It appears now that, in particular mythical Siberian discourses, cate gories such as animal species and spirits are understood as position- or relation-dependent (for a position is a relation to an external space). This radi calised version of 'cosmological deixis' suppresses the taxonomic contradiction implied by the attribution of several species identities to the same being: I can be both a human (with respect to myself) and a seal (with respect to a predator-spirit) and a spirit (when I visit spirits' camp), if human, seal and spirit are relational notions. The position-dependency of identities in Siberian myths and tales was clearly noticed by Lot-Falck: 'While animal is a man in his domain, man appears as an animal, outside of "his home"' (1953: 21). Perspectival changes appear now to be nothing but consequences of a primordial positional movement. This secondary character of perception is observed by Pedersen, Empson &amp; Humphrey when they describe in Inner Asia some 'instances of movement', which 'allow people to jump in and out of new positions that allow them to see the world from different axes' (2007:150, my emphasis). There is an important theoretical consequence of all this. We have suggested that the perspectivist formula - 'there are different perspectives that are rigidly rooted in bodies' - entails a contradiction, for it is refuted each time it is enunci ated by a bodied being (how may he know that other bodies' perspectives are different?). However, this objection seemed to be invalidated by Viveiros de Castro's distinction between intellectual representation and perception. Now if species terms in the formula 'spirits see humans as animal/peccaries/seal/etc.' are understood as relational, this 'see as' cannot be, as Viveiros de Castro claimed, a mere perception. The fact that a spirit sees me as a seal (and not as flower or a cloud) is information about our (fairly worrying) prey-predator relation rather than about its optical organs. A relation, no matter whether it is causal or inten tional, is never perceived by the senses; it can only be inferred by a mind from perceptions. If the relation is intersubjective, as hunting is understood in Siberia and Amazonia, the idea of this relation must necessarily be shared by the subjects involved in it. The perspectivist contradiction is definite; however, rather than an illustration of this paradox, mythical Siberian discourses seem to express a kind of tautology. It states that a being who is put in a position usually proper to a species becomes, in a positional sense, a member of this species.</page><page sequence="12">294 CHARLES STEPANOFF THE ORIGINALITY OF PERSPECTIVEM: A PERCEPTUAL IDIOM Animism, even in the modem sense of recognising a social character to relations between humans and nonhumans, all endowed with a human interiority, has not been ignored by Siberia's classical specialists. Shtemberg described the 'animist man's world' in this way (1927: 48-9): 'animals and spirits are distinguished from man only because they appear to him under particular aspects'. Thus the world is seen as 'a symbiosis of beings different by their outer appearance but similar by their nature. For him [the animist], the world is only one society of men, animals and spirits.' In regard to this ancient report, the originality of perspectivist anthropology is the introduction of a phenomenological approach in a structuralist anthropology. The phenomenological concern for the way things appear to a consciousness leads to the use of a perceptive idiom. Where native discourses are focused on 'healing', 'eating', 'metamorphosing into', i.e. on empirical relations between beings, perspectivist analysis speaks about 'seeing as', 'contemplation' and 'per spectives'. This focus on perception is not philosophically neutral. While any perception can be reduced to the perceiving subject and thus internalised ('I per ceive nothing but my perceptions'), interaction implies a difference between a self and an Otherness. A false perception remains, though illusory, a perception, whereas a false relation is solitude. This particularity of perception is what per mits perspectivism's metaphysical extension, namely the 'multinaturalism', a kind of 'species solipsism' which postulates that a species perspective, being body-dependent, is autonomous and incommensurable with other perspectives. These principles are very familiar to the Western reader: one recognises in them such great philosophical traditions as idealism and phenomenology, except that the role usually played by the perceiving subject is now allotted to whole species. WESTERN ROOTS OF PERSPECTIVEM Though it is understood in contemporary anthropology as diametrically opposed to 'Western thinking', perspectivism is an important trend in the history of Western ideas. The word 'perspectivism' was created by Nietzsche borrowing ideas developed by Leibniz in the seventeenth century (Nehamas 1983). The con tinuity from Leibniz to Viveiros de Castro is explicit through the Leibnizian formula 7epoint de vue est dans le corps' (quoted through Deleuze in Viveiros de Castro 1996: epigraph; 1998: 485, note 12; 2006:48). The originality of Leibniz besides other idealists, and what makes him the founder of perspectivism, is the claim that a world is produced not only by a consciousness, but by any point of view, i.e. each place in the universe. The totality of the perceptions concealed in a point of view is substantialised in a 'soul' or a 'monad'. This infinite multiplica tion of souls leads from idealism to Leibnizian animism or panpsychism. As</page><page sequence="13">DEVOURING PERSPECTIVES 295 Leibniz sums it up, 'the result of each view of the universe as seen from a dif ferent position is a substance which expresses the universe conformably to this view (...) it follows from what we have just said that each substance is a world by itself, independent of everything else excepting God.'6 If each view is inde pendent from others and, therefore, from its own objects, how can perceptions be relevant and how can interaction between viewers be possible? Leibniz's answer is theological: what ensures that miraculously all monadic worlds can cooperate, or to take Leibniz's suggestive metaphor, that all clocks are in time, is the almighty action of the 'Great Clockmaker', God. In Leibnizian perspectivism, God is the unique perceiving subject of all perspectives. However, Siberian nomads do not see themselves as monads: there is no Great Clockmaker in their cosmologies, so that perspectivism will be difficult to acclimatize there. Our departure point was: why are shamans regularly ascribed a tendency to cannibalism? The hypothesis that shamans see people as prey animals is not explicative since this vision can only be the expression of a pre-existing pred ator/prey relation - which remains to be explained. Another approach to shamans' relation with their environment can be found in Caroline Humphrey's important suggestion that religious specialists are a corollary of the native appre hension of 'causal processes pertaining to beings, or kinds of existence, in the world'(Humphrey &amp; Onon 2003 [1996]: 51). Objects like mountains, Humphrey argues, exemplify particular processes which require their own rituals and spe cialists. I would like to underline that causal processes are particular relations that cannot be understood without exploring the properties of the terms involved in them. Hence Humphrey's stress on natural beings' 'own kinds of causal force or energy' (Humphrey &amp; Onon 2003 [1996]: 52). Such a causal approach may spare us the tautologies of the above-mentioned myths that explain peculiar relations by the peculiarity of relations. We will thus consider which intrinsic properties ascribed to some humans called 'shamans' causally lead them, unlike laymen, to be involved in cannibal relations. MULTIDIRECTIONAL FLOWS In Siberia, shamans' cannibal practices are not seen as a bad habit of a particular category of 'evil' or 'black' shamans, or as a lapse contradicting their benevolent mission of healing. Rather, it looks like an inevitable expression of what makes them shamans. Humans are just one of the numerous objects of their appetite, besides hostile spirits and simple presents of meat and alcohol (many old proverbs in Altai-Sayan compare shamans' greed to dog's hunger). Indeed, a devouring power is required in shamans' ritual practices against evil forces. Swallowing is a technique integrated in shamanic healings throughout Siberia. A Tozhu shaman described the treatment he reserved for a spirit causing disease: 'Your black liver, your bloody heart, I ate' (Vainshtein 1961: 190). There are many descriptions of shamans sucking the skin of the patient in order to catch the</page><page sequence="14">296 CHARLES STEPANOFF harmful spirit, suck it up before spitting it out or swallowing it (e.g. among Koriaks: Jochelson 1905-1908: 51). Devouring and swallowing indicate incoming flows, but there are also out flows from the shaman's body. These are indicated by spitting, a frequent gesture in therapeutic rituals. One complex ritual I attended in Tuva (Süt-Khöl region) aimed to find the lost soul of an ill man and to bring it back to him. In her songs the shaman described her trip to the 'yellow steppe' in search of the soul. With the help of 'seven wolves', her auxiliary spirits, she caught the soul and transported it back. At the end she took some water in her mouth and spat three times on the face of the man. By this action, the soul she had incorporated was reintegrated in the body of the man. Not only souls but also meat can be transferred through a shaman's spitting: in an Evenk ritual, the shaman bites and tears up with his teeth the raw heart of a sacrificed reindeer, then he spits a piece of meat at his spirits' representations (Anisimov 1958: 209-10). Apart from the mouth that yawns, swallows and spits, spirits and life sub stances are supposed to penetrate the shamans through their armpits, anus and sinciput. As it appears, devouring is only one aspect of a more general phenom enon: the multidirectional flows of blood, flesh and invisible substances that seem to cross shamans. THE DEVOURED SHAMAN In Siberia flesh consumption requires reciprocity (Hamayon 1990): this is dra matically true for the shaman, who not only terrifically 'devours' others, but himself is 'devoured'. Tungus of Verkhne-Vilyuisk consider that auxiliary spirits drink the blood of shamans during their ritual (Vasilevich 1969: 234). When the Nanai shaman dances, his spirits 'descend into his body to have some food that the shaman has tasted' (Boulgakova 1996: 279). It is said among Yakuts that shamans are skinny because their spirits eat the nutritious substances of their food. That is the very reason why it is generally considered that one can feed shaman's auxiliary spirits by feeding the shaman himself. Nivkhs explained to Shtemberg that 'it seems to the audience that the shaman is eating, but in fact it is the kekhrt, his helper spirit, who is eating' (Shtemberg 1933: 322). This situation of being both devouring and devoured is not considered as a contingent feature of the shaman practice. This is impressively displayed in a cru cial episode of shamans' biographies among Altai-Sayan Turkic peoples. These narratives follow a stable scenario of development of the shaman (Stépanoff 2007a; 2007b). First, the shaman is 'made' (chaja-/jaja-) as shaman in the womb of his mother by the divine creator Ülgen/Kudai. During early childhood his par ents notice specific behaviour and physical features, like a growth on the toe or the arm. These physical peculiarities are seen as the index of the presence of a 'superfluous bone' (artyg söök). Indeed among all Turkic people of Siberia it is claimed that shamans have a special skeleton.</page><page sequence="15">DEVOURING PERSPECTIVES 297 At the second stage, when the child begins to speak, his relatives will notice his unusual perceptual capacities indicating a special relational quality. This quality is implemented only in the third stage, when the adolescent falls under the 'pressure' of spirits. Among Turkic and Tungus peoples, this is indicated by epilepsy, yawns, meteorism (abdominal distension), cramps, tendency to swallow metallic objects (Verbickii 1893:45; Delaby 1976:40). All these strange features tend to represent the novice's body as an object without closed bound aries, a spongy being. Then the visions begin in which the novice sees himself eaten by spirits. He is dismembered, his flesh is eaten and his bones are checked by spirits (to my knowledge, the most ancient report of this theme dates back to the 1860s: Khudiakov 1969: 309). This vision is found in all Turkic traditions in Siberia, but not only there: according to some narratives, young Tungus shamans of Angara are dismembered, their flesh is chopped, skewered and eaten by spirits who drink their blood. Likewise, it is precisely the smell of his flesh and blood which leads the helping spirits to attack the Nanai novice and compel him to become a shaman (Smoliak 1991). It is understood that eating and being eaten are connected by a causal relation, for the latter is the material condition of the former. The dreamed devouring engages the mechanics of circulation in which the shaman's body will be involved throughout his life. A Yakut explained to Ksenofontov (1998 [1928]: 86) that a shaman has no healing powers 'unless the spirit originating the disease has received his part of his flesh after the cutting up'. In other words, the shaman's therapeutic power is derived from the very processes that are supposed to occur in his body. The speci ficity of the shaman's body is not assigned to his position in an interaction with spirits; on the contrary, his particular body is the necessary condition for the establishment of such relations. In his dream, devouring is usually connected with the 'checking' of the presence of the supplementary bone (among Evenks see Delaby 1976: 45; among Turkic peoples, Stépanoff 2007a). Thus, spirits do not make the novice become a shaman, they verify that he is a 'genuine' one. These conceptions suggest that the cited peoples share an essentialist under standing of the shaman's status, which is even more clear in the practical logic of relations between laymen and shamans. What is under a shamanic costume? In Altai-Sayan, it is not sufficient to wear a shamanic costume to be recognized as a 'genuine shaman'. If a 'simple man' puts on a shamanic costume it is not expected that he will experience non-human perspectives, but rather that he will die. Alternatively, if the shamanic costume itself is not a 'genuine' one, nothing will happen and the pretender will just be a 'charlatan'. All peoples of Siberia har bour a creeping doubt about the authenticity of their shamans. This scepticism cannot be related to the influence of a 'rationalist' Soviet education. When Potanin visited Altaians, Tuvans and Buryats, he noticed that for them 'present</page><page sequence="16">298 CHARLES STEPANOFF shamans are not true, they are mere impostors' (1883: 68). Shamans themselves are the best promoters of these suspicions. A Chukchi shaman said to Bogoras that 'he was not like modem shamans, but he was the equal of the ancient "gen uine" shamans' (1904-1910: 421). This claim is still frequently heard among contemporary Tuvan shamans, who denounce each other as 'charlatans'. In Altai-Sayan possessing a drum and a costume is a typical feature of the common definition of a shaman. However 1) there are recognized shamans without costume and drum, and 2) people would consider it excessively naive to suppose that all shamanic costume wearers are 'genuine shamans'. Thus, visible criteria defining a shaman are neither necessary nor sufficient, which reveals an essentialist understanding (on essentialist understanding of ritual specialists, see Boyer 1994). The idea that paraphernalia is insufficient is notably circulated through a series of narratives known in Southern Siberia since the end of the nineteenth centuiy: the story of a non-flammable shaman.7 In its schematic struc ture, the narrative begins with the decision of a ruler (Chinese emperor, Mongolian khan, Russian tsarina or KGB officer) to sort out genuine and false shamans. For that purpose, he organises a test: he gathers all shamans to a stake and bums them while they are beating their drums. All shamans wear their para phernalia, but only one survives by flying up: he is recognised by that power as the genuine shaman. If the narrator is a shaman, he ordinarily claims to be a descendant of this non-flammable shaman. ESSENCES AND POROUS BODIES If we try to take into account the hypotheses and expectations of natives that permit the regular appearance of shamans, it is striking to notice that they are not concerned with the scholar's demand for contextualisation. I have been surprised several times in Tuva by the fact that, unlike urban Tuvan intellectuals, who con sider shamans as a product of the 'Tuvan cultural heritage', herdsmen expected that shamans would appear in France as well as in Tuva. They met my denials with scepticism and polite irony. For them, the birth of shamans was a phenom enon obviously independent from cultural diversity and historical change. They interpret their social function as derived from bodily peculiarities. Among other peoples of Siberia, it is also frequent that some atypical phys ical features noticed in childhood are associated with a shamanic fate. Kets recognise turning over in the cradle as a sign of shamanhood and a mole-like spot on the skin as a sign of witchcraft (Donner 1933); Selkups notice curly hair, a large forehead, a piercing gaze (Prokof'eva 1981: 46); for Nenecs, a birth-mark or 'a pellicle at the crown of his head' are significant (Khomich 1996:43, note 4); and such two distant peoples as Nganasans and Nanais consider that children bom 'in the caul'are füture shamans (Popov 1936: 83; Smoliak 1991: 35). These features are generally innate, so that, adopting the definition of 'nature' elabo rated by Humphrey about Daur shamanism as what is 'uncreated, spontaneous or</page><page sequence="17">DEVOURING PERSPECTIVES 299 innate' (Humphrey &amp; Onon 2003 [1996]: 52), we can conclude that shamanic status is understood as a 'natural' fact. Of course, these innate peculiarities on their own are never considered as the only criteria for becoming a shaman; they are treated as visible indices of a bodily quality which is invisible. I call it an essence, i.e. a non-obvious feature which causally determines a cluster of other features, in particular visible ones. The internal essence of shamans, embedded in a special bone or another invisible fea ture, is understood to cause the complete constitution of their bodies. Considered as the condition for the establishment of relations with spirits, the quality of the shaman's body has to be ascertained by laymen. In Siberia there is a type of disturbing performance which seems specifically devoted to the public checking of the shaman's body. However, although fre quently described in the ethnography of Siberia, these shamanic 'tricks' have not given rise to theoretical interpretations. In Tuva, I was often told stories about shamans from earlier generations who stabbed themselves in the heart or fired at themselves with a gun, and, unharmed, could then drink their cup of tea. Such narratives are common in Siberia; they are as ancient as the first records about Siberian shamans. Russian chronicles about Ermak's expedition around 1581 report that Cossacks attended a ritual where a shaman (called shaitanshchik), on being stabbed, drank his own blood (Miller 1999: 246-7). From the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries, reliable travellers and scholars such as J. Bell, I.G. Gmelin and S.P. Krasheninikov have observed in Siberia shamans stabbing themselves. Lastly, Bogoras has given a detailed description of such techniques used by Chukchi shamans (1904-1910:447). The purpose of all these strange spectacles becomes clear if we understand that they are a way of checking the intrinsic penetrability of the shamanic body. In this respect, Yakuts have explicitly developed an interesting theory about the shaman's body. It was considered among Yakuts that a 'good shaman' had to be able to make a knife pass from one side to the other of his body (Seroshevskii 1993 [1896]: 607). Such feats are permitted by 'bodily differences' of the shaman: his body has 'holes' (oibon) under the skin and this is the very sign that 'he is not a charlatan but a genuine shaman' (Popov 1949: 289). The best shamans are supposed to have nine 'holes'. In a Yakut narrative, a man becomes a shaman, without any intervention of spirits, after having remarked that his shadow has holes. Some shamans were also said to have a pocket in their stomach called a kieli in which swallowed spirits were conserved (Popov 1949: 289-90). Applied to the human body, the name kieli usually refers to the female womb; therefore the shamanic kieli should certainly be connected with the capacity ascribed to certain male shamans to give birth to animals (Seroshevskii 1993 [1896]: 609). Similar conceptions appear in the name contemporary Yakuts give to a person somehow connected with spirits: a 'man with an open body' (ahagas éttéékh kihi). Thus, for Yakuts, the transference capacities of shamans are deeply embodied in their anatomy. If these holes in the body help the shaman to eat spirits, obvi</page><page sequence="18">300 CHARLES STÉPANOFF ously shamanic cannibalism also finds its way there. This kind of embodied can nibalism is explicitly suggested by Nganasans: their shamans are believed to possess special mouths in their bodies through which they eat people's souls (Lambert 2002-2003:234). Porosity is a condition for being the locus of circulation through consump tion. Healing rituals use the devouring capacities of the shaman by turning them in a convenient direction. Rituals and paraphernalia aim to help the shaman both to develop and to control this capacity. But it can happen that the shaman loses his mastery and makes his relatives his meal instead of spirits or enemies. At the beginning of the twentieth century when they approached death, Tuvan shamans were bound and abandoned by their relatives because in the last minutes of his life the Tuvan shaman 'becomes crazy' and 'devours all that fall under his gaze, he kills cattle and people, he does not recognize anybody any more' (Turchaninov 2003 [1915-1916]: 183). In this essentialist scheme, which is frequent in Siberia though not exclusive, the shaman's body is from birth (as opposed to by will) an active channel, and that is why, traditionally, devouring is not precisely understood as a 'bad action' from an ethical point of view. Cannibal shamans are killed or abandoned in order to preserve lay people rather than as a kind of punishment. ANOTHER APPROACH: PERSPECTIVEM AT WORK In this essentialist context, what status should be given to the constant concern of Siberian peoples for non-human perspectives? If anthropology is not only a his tory of ideas, but a social science, indigenous theories should interest us by their implementation in practice. Here I will try to follow Willerslev's wise proposi tion to 'bring perspectivism "down to earth'", recognizing that perspectivist theory 'remains an abstract model, detached from the real experiences of people in a lifeworld' (Willerslev 2007: 94-5). First, it should be noticed that knowing others' perspective gives a serious advantage in interaction. In this way, describing the nonhumans' point of view is not a contemplation but an action that moves the balance of power on behalf of humans. Though they seem to pos tulate a symmetry between human and nonhuman, 'perspectivist' narratives create de facto an asymmetrical situation. For example, the Chukchi, although claiming to know the kély's perspective, consider that these spirits do not know the human perspective. In a Chukchi tale, we see a kély incapable of feeding his human wife because when she asks for seal meat he gives her sea worm and so on. The disgusted wife soon leaves this unsympathetic husband (Bogoras 1913: 89). Therefore I would not apply to Siberia the definition of spirits as a 'view from everywhere', which 'implies the world seen in totally clear and unambiguous visibility' proposed by Holbraad &amp; Willerslev (2007: 334-5). It is well known that spirits are understood in North Asia as having limited perceptions and faulty</page><page sequence="19">DEVOURING PERSPECTIVES 301 minds incapable of understanding metaphors. If spirits have some supernatural capacities, they are neither perceptual nor cognitive. In fact, a pragmatic reading of Siberian narratives about non-human perspec tives demonstrates that their purpose is not to claim a Western post-modem platitude such as 'all points of view are equally valuable'. These narratives speak to their listeners of action and strategies, in particular how to defend oneself against the appetite of the spirits. What does the clumsiness of the spirits' per spective consist of? Crucially, it is manifested in an incapacity to distinguish perception from reality. Ignoring essentialist thinking, spirits are idealists: they have no idea of a reality independent from its ideal and perceptual representa tions. Siberians, far from taking such a philosophy as a model, make use of it to deceive spirits. We have seen that Chukchi informants of Bogoras said that humans are little seals for kély spirits. A Chukchi tale seems to show how this particularity of kély vision can be used to the advantage of humans. A Chukchi having met a kély offers him liver to eat, knowing that kély like it. He puts a little dead seal on his chest, opens its liver and eats it. The kély, thinking that the man has torn his own liver, tries to do the same, rips open his abdomen and dies (Bogoras 1913: 43). Here, clearly, the spirit's perspective is the target of the action. The man leads the spirit to adopt an incorrect vision, probably taking advantage of the kély's ten dency to see humans as seals. The result of this illusion is the death of the dangerous kély, a non-perspective-dependent event. All specialists of North Asia could cite many examples of humans' actions which influence non-humans' (spirits') perspectives: imitating raven's cawing whilst eating bear's meat, orientating a bear's skull to divert its revenge, dressing a boy or doing his hair in a feminine way and vice versa. Idealist spirits cannot guess an essence beyond appearance. However, humans do distinguish between reality and its perceptions; hence they seek to act on the spirits' perception of reality, which is not to change the reality itself (e.g. making one's son become a girl). DECEPTION IN RITUAL: DEVOURED PERSPECTIVES Generally when a fairly traditional Tuvan shaman wants to expel a harmful spirit from the body of a patient, his ritual action employs two kinds of technique: 1) a manipulation of the spirit's perspective, i.e. an attempt to convince or to deceive him; and 2) an elimination of the spirit either by removing him or by eating him. In the first stage, one can say the spirit's perspective is shifted, in the second it is devoured. The shaman Kh. K. often uses a little anthropomorphic figure made from dough. After having 'untied' the spirit from the body of the patient, she makes the gesture to put it with her drumstick in the figurine. The spirit is supposed to see the figurine as a real human in whom he will settle, however the figurine is imme</page><page sequence="20">302 CHARLES STEPANOFF diately thrown in the street by the patient. Kh. K. explains that the figurine is then eaten by dogs that will die later. The devourer and its perspective are thus eventu ally devoured. The effect of ritual deception on a spirit is colourfiilly expressed in the tale cited above about 'the man visiting the spirits' country'. This story explains how it is possible to act on a spirit (in the tale: a man in the position of a spirit with respect to spirits) in order to expel him. In the Dukha variant, the spirits' lama exorcist offers to the visitor a horse skull and a grass doll. Laypeople see that it is mere bone and grass, but thanks to the magic of the exorcist the visitor sees these objects as a magnificent mount and a beautiful woman. Only back in his own country does he realise the extent of his mistake, discovering under him the skull and the grass (Chagdarsürüng 1994: 159-64). This lure is found elsewhere in North Asia: in a Nganasan variant, the shaman gives a wooden figure to the vis itor who required a reindeer. The shaman forces the visitor to see the figure as a real reindeer and to accept it. Back in his country, the piqued man eventually recognises that this shaman has been 'powerful and cunning' (Dolgikh 1976:33). If shamanic practice turns to deception in order to expel enemies, it means that there is a difference between perspectives which correctly describe facts and illusions which lead to defeat. Instead of the idealist postulates of Western meta physics, in Siberia the competition between beings implies a common reality beyond their perspectives. The existence of the real, as defined at the beginning of this study, is demonstrated. CONCLUSION The question of cannibalism attributed to shamans led us to too brief a survey of Siberian ethnography and perspectivist theory. We have proposed to interpret Siberian discourses about perspectives in connection with the pragmatic contexts in which they are elaborated and with the practical uses which they implement. Two understandings of the specificities of a body have arisen. The first approach is an intellectual experience, often developed in the specific context of legendary narratives. It suggests the definition of the body of a being by its position in an interaction. To have a spirit's body means to have been moved into an alien world; to have a bear's body means to be a ritually respected prey, brought home. This positional definition of kinds of body requires in any case a common refer ential space. Perspectival changes appear to be mere consequences of positional movements in this realistic frame, so that a percept-focused theory like perspec tivism can only superficially describe these processes. Practices demonstrate a second logic, quite different and more essentialist. The particular intrinsic features ascribed to the shamanic bodies are not the con sequence but the material condition of possibility for relations with spirits. While Western medical representations build the image of one universal human body, Siberians conceptualise different kinds of body which, though externally similar,</page><page sequence="21">DEVOURING PERSPECTIVES 303 are endowed with different anatomies and powers. The theme of shamans' canni balism both expresses and impressively contributes to spreading implicit hypotheses about channelling properties of the shamanic body, which place it in the centre of multidirectional flows. In rituals, thanks to these capacities and to their knowledge of nonhuman visions, realist Siberian shamans voraciously devour idealist spirits and their perspectives.

But perspectivism is Western because it is idealist and ide alist philosophers are Westems, whereas realism is Western just because Westems are humans. Although idealism and realism can be opposed in philosophy as two rival theoret ical options, the 'social conditions of the possibility' of idealism, as Weber and Bourdieu have shown, are so demanding that it is only restricted to elites disconnected from produc tion processes, whereas the postulate of a reality independent from one's own consciousness (realism) is a universally necessary condition for the acquisition of human language and for social interaction. 3 I follow Vaté's spelling (2007). 4 Kudaidan mal surap iat [begs cattle from Kudai] (Anokhin 1924: 126, note 1). 5 The drinking of raw blood is forbidden in Southern Siberia except in highly ritualised and secret contexts aimed to appropriate personal qualities of the eaten being (e.g. a bear). In a recent insightful analysis (2007) Fausto has shown that, in Amazonian 'animistic system', ritually treating and cooking meat aims to eliminate the subjectivity of the killed animal or human. Eating a corpse as a subject would be cannibalism. Thus the anthro pophagic practices ascribed to Siberian shamans are unquestionably cannibal in Fausto's sense: moreover I argue that these practices animalise shamans. Indeed there is a paradox ical effect of ritual and culinary 'desubjectification' of the meat: on the one hand these practices reveal the attribution of a subjectivity to eaten animals, but on the other hand they deepen the difference between human and animals, which appear to be all cannibals. 6 Discours de métaphysique, XIV: 7e resultat de chaqué veue de l'univers, comme regardé d'un certain endroit, est une substance qui exprime l'univers conformément ä cette veue (...) il s 'ensuit de ce que nous venons de dire, que chaqué substance est comme un monde á part, independant de toute autre chose hors de Dieu.'
