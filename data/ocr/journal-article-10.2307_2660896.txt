<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONGEALING DIVINITY: TIME, WORSHIP AND KINSHIP IN SOUTH INDIAN HINDUISM ANTHONY GOOD University of Edinburgh Daily worship in Hindu temples is characterized by regular repetition. This article juxta- poses iconography and mythology; field data on worship in a Murukan temple in Kalugu- malai, South India; and analytic concepts from western and Indian metaphysics, to examine what Gell termed the 'ritual manipulation of time'. In Hindu cosmology, the materializa- tion of divinity - a prerequisite for worship - is inseparably linked not only to the emer- gence of time but also to the devolution of divinity into gendered forms. Because gender differences play a central role in iconography, mythology and worship, Hinduism provides a rich cultural resource for debating the morality and practice of human kinship, sexuality and procreation. Not only are there significant homologies between human and divine kinship behaviour, but human marriage patterns in South India display the same blend of repetitive yet changing oscillation as do daily and annual temple liturgies. 'The repetitiousness of worship in a Hindu temple is one of its most striking features', as Fuller (1984: 15) rightly comments. Periodic rites of this kind raise questions about what Gell termed the 'ritual manipulation of time' (1992: 37). Why is worship performed several times daily? Why at these particular times? How do these services relate to other rites with different periodicities? In providing partial answers to these questions, this article also sheds light on what seems at first a completely different topic, namely, pat- terns of human kinship in southern India. The link between the two proves to lie in a distinctively Hindu metaphysics, linking the nature of both time and gender to cosmogonic processes of separation and reaggregation which are regularly reenacted in temple liturgy. Post-Dumontian studies of South Indian kinship have stressed local theo- ries about exchanges of bodily substance through sexual intercourse and diet. For example, cross-cousin marriage has been explained as the ideal means of ensuring that offspring possess the caste's unique substance and distinctive moral code.The problem is that although marriage patterns are quite uniform across the region (Good 1996), indigenous ideas about genetics and procre- ation reported by writers like Barnett (1976) and Daniel (1984) are diverse and restricted in currency. Many Tamils do not habitually speak about kinship in terms of blood or substance, and deny its relevance if asked. I argue else- where (Good forthcoming) that Hinduism provides a more promising indigenous perspective on South Indian kinship.

This article uses similar material to explain the significance of repetition in routine worship in South Indian Saiva temples, and thereby derives a partial explanation of why divine sexuality lies at the core of that worship. My data come mainly from the town of Kalugumalai in Tirunelveli Dis- trict, Tamil Nadu, which lies below a 600-foot hill towering out of the dusty plain. A cave in the base of this hill is the main shrine of a temple to Kaluka- calamurtti, a local form of Murukan, son of Siva. His stone image shows him seated on a peacock, flanked by his wives Teyvayanai and Valli. An ante- chamber where the priest stands to perform worship opens onto a dais below which worshippers stand (Figure 1). This outer room also contains shrines to Sanmukam and Nataraj, secondary forms of Murukan and Siva, respectively. Outside its entrance is a statue of Murukan's vehicle, the peacock, beyond which are the main flagstaff and altar. To the south stands a Siva temple, which also holds his wife Parvati, here named Akilantisvari, and their eldest son Ganesh. Iconography and mythology Sexuality, eroticism and fertility are core themes in Saivite Hinduism (O'Flaherty 1981). The most common icon representing Siva, as in Kalugumalai, is the linkam, a colunm with a rounded top. It is generally seen as phallic (Gopinatha Rao 1997, 2: 69); its base is a female yoni or vulva; and the shrine in which it stands is the 'womb-chamber' (karppa kirakam). Such linikams represent the union or fusion of god and goddess in the undivided (ni4kalam) form of Siva known as Paramasiva (Brunner-Lachaux 1990: 13n). However, Siva and Parvati are unable to reproduce by normal means. Their first son Ganesh was born from Parvati's sweat or bathwater (Courtright 1985: 41-6), and his relationship with his mother is one of suppressed ero- ticism; he acquired his incongruous elephant's head after Siva beheaded him in a jealous rage (Shulman 1980: 235). Their second son Murukan was formed from Siva's semen, or the sparks from his third eye, but Parvati claimed him from the start and he is generally represented as the child of them both (1980: 247; Figure 2). A third son, far less prominent in iconography, myth, or ritual, is Antaka ('the Blind'), who was born from the darkness of Siva's body while Parvati's hands were over Siva's eyes. He too desires Parvati; he fights Siva and is impaled on Siva's trident, but is pardoned and becomes one of Siva's devotees (O'Flaherty 1981: 190-1). Siva's mythology exhibits a tension between his ascetic, celibate state and his domestic status as husband and father (O'Flaherty 1981). In temples this is usually resolved in favour of his married state, exemplified by the Soma- skantar icon. This depicts an anthropomorphic Siva, with Parvati to his left, and between them their son Murukan (Sastri 1986 [1916]: 107). Kalugumalai has a large bronze Somaskantar image, which often goes out in procession along with an image of Akilantisvari; they may share a palanquin, as during Kalukacalamurtti's wedding processions, or ride on separate bronze bulls.There is no festival image of Siva alone, and Somaskantar always represents him on</page><page sequence="3">ANTHONY GOOD 275 leyvayanai e Ua // ~~~~~~~~~Kalukacalamurtti I L ?L'' Pilla S FIGURE 1.

This is because his consort embodies his active power or energy (s'aktt); worshipping Siva nearly always involves worshipping his wife too (Fuller 1980a: 326). By contrast, though Kalukacalamurtti is usually accompanied by his wives, he often processes alone, notably when he fights the demons during the Kanda Sasti festival.

The divine genealogy in Tanifl Saivism. Murukan possesses his own s'akti, inherited from his mother and represented by the lance he always carries. The point is that despite its enormous potential energy, male divinity can only intervene actively in the cosmos when associated with the female prin- ciple. In the human world too, a man without a wife is socially incomplete. For example, priests in the Minaksi temple at Madurai must have living wives, because in order to worship the deities they must have access to s'akti through legitimate sexual relations (1980a: 326 n.); the same sometimes applies to mediums (Kapadia 1995: 131). Thus, goddesses and women possess creative and fertile powers upon which gods and men depend to fulfil their destinies. There is another twist to this. Priests see themselves as prime devotees of the deity for whom they officiate, and male Hindu devotees often adopt female personx vis-a-vis their chosen gods. But whereas most devotees stress erotic love in their poetry, the priest's relationship to the deity is one of wifely servant (Fuller 1979: 470). Worship is above all a rite of hospitality, and its performance enacts the behaviour of a dutiful wife towards her husband and his guests. The principal deity in Sankaranayinarkovil temple, 15 kilometres west of Kalugumalai, is Sankaranarayanar, whose right side is male, and left side female. When I visited, the male side had an ash-smeared face and wore a tiger skin; the female side had a dark face and wore a green sari. The usual androgyne in Saivite iconography is Ardhanarisvarar, blending Siva and Parvati, but Sankaranarayanar represents the union of Siva and Mohini, a female form of Lord Visnu. A well-known myth tells of Siva's seduction by Mohini in the pine forest, after which the village god Aiyanar was born from Siva's spilled semen (O'Flaherty 1981: 229) in a replica of Murukan's own birth. This follows a moral lesson in which Visnu/Mohini seduced the sages of the pine forest and Siva seduced their wives, to reveal to them the strength of their enduring attachment to worldly matters. The story depicts 'the tension between life in the world and renunciation', resolvable only through devotion (Shulman 1980: 309-10). Some Tamils regard androgynous deities as exemplars of marriages in which husband and wife play complementary roles with neither dominating. The</page><page sequence="5">ANTHONY GOOD 277 situations in other famous temples are cited to illustrate rival connubial arrangements. Chidambaram, where Siva as Nataraj is spatially and liturgically central, is used to support arguments that husbands should dominate and control their wives, while Minaksi's alternation between independence and union with Sundaresvarar at Madurai (see below) can support a view that although husbands exercise authority in public, wives have power behind the scenes (Daniel 1980). Divine weddings Temple rituals are full of expressions of sexuality and kinship. Divine wed- dings are obvious examples, and Kalugumalai celebrates two annually (Good 1989b; 1991: 248 f.). Teyvayanai is Indra's daughter and personifies the army of the gods (another form of s'akti); Kalukacalamurtti marries her at Kanda Sasti festival in November, after defeating the demons in battle. By contrast, Vali is the daughter of an ascetic and a doe. She was born in a furrow and raised by a tribal family. Murukan meets her deep in the forest where she is guarding her father's crops, and marries her after Pankuni Uttiram in February. His first wife thus assures his position in the divine pantheon; he proves himself worthy by defeating the demons, then marries the king of the gods' daughter. His other wife links him to the territory in which his temple is located; she represents the forest, agriculture and autochthonous tribal people. His double marriage therefore expresses his rule over both the celestial realm and the region wherein his temple lies; in both cases he exerts sovereignty thanks to his wives' s'akti, illustrating that divine marriage is concerned with acquiring power. The myth reveals that despite their appar- ently different statuses, his brides are really Visnu's daughters Amutavalli and Suntaravalli (Dessigane &amp; Pattabiramin 1967: 25).' Tamils see Parvati as Visnu's sister, so Siva and Visnu are brothers-in-law (Beck 1974: 10)2 and Kalukacalamurtti marries his MBDs in typical South Indian fashion. Another source of power is sacrifice. O'Flaherty identifies a llmythic proto- type involving 'two basic processes: a sacrifice and a marriage. The sacrifice brings gods and humans together through food that is obtained by slaughter. The marriage brings men and women together through sex. . . expressed through metaphors of food and eating' (1980: 151). One could certainly con- struct a parallel argument to my own with sacrifice rather than sexuality as dominant theme (in mythology, children may result from either activity). However, and pace Biardeau (Biardeau &amp; Malamoud 1976: 139-40), who argues that Brahmanic worship is essentially sacrificial, it would be based mainly on myth rather than temple ritual, in which worship, puja, is clearly distinguished from sacrifice, pali (Fuller 1988: 24). Shulman argues that the growth of bhakti devotionalism made it increasingly unacceptable for deities to be overtly tainted with sacrificial violence (1980: 92), hence the pre- eminence of the marital theme in Tamil temple ritual. Marriage too entails violence and impurity, as both are pre-conditions for fertility, but this is more easily concealed or deflected than for sacrifice, where it is generally achieved by duplicating the dramatis personae. As god's purity is inviolable, his more problematic characteristics are devolved onto a 'demon' who is sacrificed in</page><page sequence="6">278 ANTHONY GOOD his place; both Antaka and Ganesh suffer this fate at Siva's hands, and Murukan sacrifices a string of demons immediately before his first wedding. The paral- lel to the god-demon dualism is that between the chaste, wifely 'goddess of the breast', and the murderous yet fertile 'goddess of the tooth' (O'Flaherty 1980: 90). It is, however, too simple to oppose Teyvayanai and Valli as god- desses of breast and tooth, respectively; each combines both attributes in dis- tinctive fashion. Valli embodies earthy fertility yet is a timid tribal girl, while the Brahmanic Teyvayanai eponymizes militaristic force and violence. This brief survey was meant to illustrate how Hindu mythology, icono- graphy, and ritual provide overwhelmingly rich, complex treatments of the various permutations of divine sexuality and kinship. From now on, my prin- cipal aim will be to consider routine daily temple worship from this per- spective, and show how its never-ending repetitions link divine sexuality with such fundamental metaphysical properties as time and matter. The daily liturgy Temple worship helps maintain cosmic stability, and must be performed every day without fail. In Kalugumalai this involves six daily services (puija) at specific times (kalam). Despite differences in detail, these share a basic four- fold structure: unction (apicekam), decoration (alanfkaram), food-offering (naivettiyam), and lamp-showing (ttparatanai). I discuss this structure in detail elsewhere (1989b: 182) and the emphasis here is on the daily timetable as a whole. Even in summary it provides ample illustration of Fuller's comment on the centrality of repetition, with which I began. The temple opens at 05.30. The divine couples spend each night in their bedrooms, so the first rite of the day is the 'bedroom lamp-offering' (palliyarai ttparatanai), discussed below. It is followed at 06.00 by the 'holy adorning' (tiruvanantat) service, and at 08.00 by 'festival worship' (vila pajai). This con- cludes with the 'daily festival' (nittiya urcavam); rice is offered on small altars around the Siva temple, and images of Sripali Nadar ('Lord of Sacrifice') and his wife are carried round to inspect these offerings. The 'royal endowment' (rajanka kai4alai) food offering at 11.00 is the last remnant of tirukalacanti, a service once associated with the morning performance by the temple dancer. After the 'noon service' (uccikalam), the temple closes until 16.30. The most extended and well-attended service is ccayaratcai at 18.00; here are Sanskrit mantras, Tamil hymns, and the most elaborate lamp-showing of the day, fol- lowed by another 'daily festival' just like the morning one. The day ends with the 'midnight service' (artta jamam) and 'bedroom worship' around 20.30. Regular sexual relations between the divine couple are necessary to pre- serve the cosmos (O'Flaherty 1981: 296; Fuller 1980a: 326) and they spend each night together in their bedroom. Kalugumalai temple actually has two bedrooms, one for Siva and Akilantisvari, the other for Kalukacalamurtti, Teyvayanai and Valli, whose small bedroom images are carried from the main shrine to their bedroom at the southwestern corner of the temple, right after the 'midnight' service. Bedroom images of gods only show their feet, but god- desses are shown in full. The images are put on a swing inside the tiled room, and bedroom worship follows; the images are offered food and milk, a light</page><page sequence="7">ANTHONY GOOD 279 is shown, then the door is closed. When the temple reopens next morning bedroom worship is performed again before the images are returned to the shrine. The 'holy adorning' service just afterwards is a specially good time to 'take darshan'. Darshan (tarisanam) means 'vision' or 'sight' of a deity, and taking darshan is a major reason for visiting temples; this sight of the deities at the height of their powers, just after waking from a night of connubial rest, is believed to be unusually beneficial. These are standard parts of Saivite liturgy but their precise significance varies according to context. In Madurai, Minaksi and Sundaresvarar occupy separate shrines during the day, whereas in the bedroom she assumes the infe- rior position on his left; moreover, because he is just a pair of feet, she is in contact with the least pure part of his body. The liturgy therefore oscillates between her separation from Sundaresvarar by day, when she is worshipped in her own right, and her union with him as his inferior wife during the night (Fuller 1984: 1 1-12).3 The rites in Kalugumalai are almost identical, and Fuller's analysis would hold in the case of Siva and Akilantisvari, but Kaluka- calamurtti and his wives are not separated by day, nor do their relative posi- tions change at night; moreover, Teyvayanai and Valli are only ever worshipped separately at their weddings, whereas Kalukacalamurtti often processes without them, reflecting the fact that he has his own s'akti as well as that from his wives. None the less, this nightly connubium of god and goddess remains central to cosmic stability, as we shall see. Philosophical and anthropological approaches to time We turn now from the alternations of divine union and separation over time, to consider the phenomenon of time itself. Western metaphysicians say time has two aspects, corresponding to tenses and dates. 'Tense' covers not just verb modifications, but all statements saying whether, and by how much, an event is past, present or future (Mellor 1981: 4); 'date' is not tied to particular cal- endars but expresses the fact that every event is simultaneous with some other events, and earlier or later than the rest (1981: 20). McTaggart (1927: 10) dubbed these two conceptualizations 'A-series' and'B-series' time, respectively. A-series time is inherently dynamic; not only do events move from 'future' to 'present' to 'past', but future events constantly become closer, and past events more distant. B-series time is more static; if one event occurs two weeks before another, they stay two weeks apart forever as they recede into the past. 'Events', which have temporal parts, are to be distinguished from 'things', which do not (Mellor 1981: 17; 1998: 85). Present things are present in their entirety, but present events began in the past and will continue into the future. Both things and events have 'duration', but whereas things endure as totali- ties throughout their existence, events appear as totalities only when their entire duration is considered. Duration is therefore merely an aspect of the historicity of a thing, but the very essence of an event. Change is defined as 'a variation in a real property of something, provided the variation does not reduce to a difference between different parts of it' (1981: 9); it is therefore, associated with time, not space, and is characteristic of things, not events.4 A temple is a thing which may change over time, whereas a ritual performance</page><page sequence="8">280 ANTHONY GOOD (it seems) is an event which does not change because it is never wholly present; apparent changes are just differences between its temporal parts (1981: 104). There can however be changes between different occurrences of particular types of event; even supposing we cannot speak of 'change' within a single day's liturgy, it can change from one day to the next. Moreover, the fact that rituals are repeated daily or annually testifies that the duration between two events of the same type may be just as significant as the duration of each in itself. Because events have duration, parts of every present event are already past and other parts are still in the future. It follows that the present may cover 'any interval of A-series moments, however long, that contains the present moment', so 'This millenium is as much a present tense as this minute' (Mellor 1981: 17). A puja earlier today can be seen as a past event or, as part of today's liturgy, a present one; likewise a pi7ja earlier this year. 'The present' is there- fore a context-dependent idea, which increases the complexity of applying the model to real situations. Even so, its conceptual clarity helps resolve con- fusion in previous anthropological writing on time in India. Most anthropologists start from Durkheim's view that time is conceptual- ized using units drawn from social life; calendars 'correspond to the periodi- cal recurrence of feasts and public ceremonies. A calendar expresses the rhythm of collective activities, while at the same time its function is to assure their regularity' (1915: 11). Writing in this tradition, Leach identified two distinct representations of time: one is repetitive like a ticking clock or beating pulse; the other non-repetitive, like ageing. Though he does not use the terms, these are B-series and A-series manifestations, respectively. Leach claims that we only place them both under the same rubric because of our fear of death; religions downplay death's finality by linking it with rebirth, thereby 'denying the second aspect of time by equating it with the first' (1961: 125). He interprets periodic festivals as rites of passage whose limninal stage involves 'suspended animation. Ordinary social time has stopped' (1961: 134). Duration can be ignored in semiological interpretations of ritual, since 'the message is trans- mitted as if everything happened simultaneously' (Leach 1976: 44). In other words, when seen primarily in terms of meaning, rituals can be analysed as atemporal wholes, as if they were things. However, many rituals are also trans- formative (Leach 1970: 824-5), and from this perspective temporal sequenc- ing and duration are essential aspects of their performance; yet even if they themselves are events which cannot be said to undergo change, they clearly do change the social statuses or spiritual conditions of those on whom their transformative power is brought to bear. Whereas Durkheim thought that sociological research into ideas about time should supersede philosophical inquiries like those summarized above, most philosophers take for granted that their introspections about time are cultural universals.Yet as Gale (1968: 5) suggests,'we should not ask what time is [but rather] how temporal language is used'. Clearly such usages differ in different cultures, and indeed, one common orientalist cliche contrasts cyclic Hindu views of time with linear western time (cf. Thapar 1996: 5); it also assumes that linear models better reflect lived experience, so cyclic ideologies should be under constant threat from the historicity of experience. This is the very 'problem' which Pocock (1964) aimed to resolve, as we shall see. However,</page><page sequence="9">ANTHONY GOOD 281 any attempt to draw sharp contrasts between views of time in two major civ- ilizations must involve gross oversimplification. We need to look more closely and ask: in what sense is Indian time 'cyclic', and in what ways is the label misleading? Certainly, Hindu cosmology stresses time-reckoning based on nested cycles. The longest cycle, the kalpa, comprises 994 mahaiyugas, each containing four yugas of unequal length during which physical and moral standards progres- sively decline, reaching rock-bottom in the kaliyuga in which we now live.5 Cyclicity does not imply exact repetition, however. Because of karma, each soul is reborn at a level determined by its previous actions, so each new birth cycle is different. This impinges on the whole cosmos because karma persists from one kalpa to the next; indeed, that is why another kalpa is necessary. Moreover, if each karmic cycle was identical, salvation would be impossible (Balslev 1983: 145-7). In short, Indian philosophy fully incorporates linear (A- series) time into the dominant cyclic (B-series) ideology (1983: 149; Thapar 1996: 7-9). Time in Hindu cosmology should be visualized not as a spinning disk, but as a wheel rolling forwards. More directly relevant to worship in Tamil temples is the Tamil philo- sophical school of ?aiva Siddhanta, whose principles are familiar to many staff and worshippers in Kalugumalai temple, and derive from the S?aivakama texts which are authoritative for Saivite worship (Devasenapathi 1974: 2). This doctrine recognizes three realities: god (pati); souls (pacu); and bonds (pacam) (1974: 69). The absolute form of pati, Paramasiva, permeates everything and has no component parts, so 'Siva and Sakti are not distinct' (Brunner-Lachaux 1963: ix). However, temple worship addresses pati's Sadasiva manifestation, linked to Siva's five functions: creating (sr$ti), preserving (sthiti), and de- stroying (samhhara) the worlds; veiling the truth in illusion or materialization (tirobhava); and bestowing salvation (anugraha).6 Souls (pacu or atman) are asso- ciated with impurity (mala), so are ignorant, powerless, and finite. Siva creates the world to help them achieve liberation by becoming pure (vimala) and formless (amarta); his act (tirobhava) has the immediate effect of enmeshing atman in the bonds of illusion (maya), but in the long term offers it the means to dissipate its mala, as explained below. Pacam, the third independent reality, denotes the five fetters binding pacu to its gross and subtle bodies: these are mala, karma, and tirobhava, already discussed; and bindu and maiya, the causes of the pure and impure worlds. Atman is enclosed in five shells (kancuka) which help form its subtle body; one of these, kala, locates it in time. It also has a gross body subject to worldly pleasures and experiences; as a result, atman accumulates karma, binding it to maya for a further life, and so on. However, mala is gradually used up over many successive rebirths; karma too can be used up if one acts to avoid accumulating more. In that case atman acquires a new body, allowing it to stay in the pure world as an intermediate step towards total liberation. Time (kalam) is thus one of the fetters binding souls to the material world. In particular, it causes the universe to function according to the laws of karma. Saiva Siddhanta distinguishes past, present and future; thus, clay is the past, a full waterpot is the future, and the artefact being shaped on the potter's wheel is the present. These are not absolute distinctions but vary for each object, so time is multiple and, consequently, non-eternal. Entities like pati and pacu are</page><page sequence="10">282 ANTHONY GOOD eternal because they are unlimited by time, not because time itself is eternal (Devasenapathi 1974: 144f.). Two key points emerge from this summary. First, in its absolute form divin- ity displays no distinction between god and goddess, Siva and s'akti. Second, titne is not a fundamental property of the universe, but one associated with a degree of materialization (miirta) and illusion (maya). The link between these apparently disconnected aspects of S?aiva Siddhanta will be explored in the next section. First, though, the best-known anthropological analysis of Hindu notions of time is Pocock's discussion of how Gujarati Patidars reconcile their experience of historical change with 'their adherence to a set of values which denies change' (1964: 19). Note that this starting premise typifies the stereotype of Hindu time as irremediably cyclic.7 Pocock first distinguishes'time-reckoning' (abstract, conceptual time) from 'duration' (time as experienced and lived- through). Time-reckoning may be continuous like clock time, or based on'time indications' like harvests, which promote stability by standing for the social activities characterizing their recurrence. Duration, however, reflects everyone's unique biography, incorporating change and other lapses from ideal social order. The resulting cosmological disruption is countered through rites of passage; by circumscribing every individual's life within the same set of ostensibly identical time indications, Patidars can go on viewing society as unaffected by historical change, that is, such rites allow them 'to cope with the effects of duration by denying them any individuality [or] historicity' (1964: 23). Pocock therefore uses 'duration' to express individual, historical experience. To my mind however, his other term,'historicity', conveys this far better.8 His use of 'duration' merely creates confusion, since the crucial contrast is not between stability and duration, but between durations separating events from the present moment, and durations separating events from one another; between 'festival X occurred last month' (A-series; continuous time- reckoning) and 'festival X occurs one month before festival Y' (B-series; dis- continuous time indication). So 'continuous time-reckoning' and 'discontinu- ous time indications', which Pocock groups together as 'social and conceptual' whereas 'duration [is] a fact of experience' (1964: 29), are actually opposed as A- and B-series time, respectively. Moreover, his 'duration' is another A-series manifestation, identified with, not opposed to, continuous time-reckoning. In short, Pocock's opposition between conceptual and experiential time does not map onto McTaggart's A-series and B-series: Pocock conceptual time experiential time continuous time-reckoning duration discontinuous time indications McTaggart A-series time B-series time continuous time-reckoning discontinuous time indications historicity For this reason, and also ethnographically, Leach's portrayal of rites of passage is more convincing than Pocock's. As noted above, such rituals are</page><page sequence="11">ANTHONY GOOD 283 transformative and do not express a single conception of time; if so, it would be hard to understand their effectiveness. Far from denying historicity, they merely superimpose B-series intervals onto the A-series phenomenon of ageing, thereby dramatizing and maximizing public recognition of changes which would otherwise be gradual. Moreover, resemblances to rites in other generations do not conceal the historicity of focal participants; on the con- trary, they explicitly link them to particular individuals who participated in their parents' rites, and others who will do likewise for their children (Good 1991: 231). Rites of passage illustrate that B-series time-reckoning permits a degree of practical human control. Ageing (A-series) involves inevitable one- way movement, and culture intervenes only in the choice of units whereby this is measured. By contrast, B-series time is itself a cultural product. Its dis- continuous time indications are culturally constituted even when seemingly triggered by astronomical or physiological events.9 Rites of passage ensure that significant transitions occur under controlled B-series conditions, rather than at arbitraly moments in the flow of A-series time. Time, gender and matter in temple liturgy Such arguments suggest that periodic rites are more than just simple, repeti- tive B-series cycles. This must be especially true of a liturgy whose perfor- mance regulates and expresses the proper unfolding of cosmic time; it does not merely incorporate both A-series and B-series representations of time, but must somehow transcend that distinction. Can this help us understand its periodicity? Cosmological notions of time are directly linked to temple worship in several ways. First, the generic name for temple services is the Sanskrit word for 'time' (kala); thus, Kalugumalai temple is said to have 'six worship kalas' (arukala piujai; Paktavatsalam 1972: 28). Kala also means 'tense', which imme- diately encourages an A-series interpretation. Second, temple liturgy acts as a bulwark, defending the cosmos from the forces of disorder. Disorder is most dramatically personified by the demons whom Murukan defeats at Kanda Sasti, but daily liturgy too is done 'pour le bien du monde' (Brunner-Lachaux 1963: xxii), so proper performance is essential.10 Third, worship is kairotic, being scheduled according to the same principles as govern the movements of sun, moon and planets, so it makes perfect sense to analyse it in terms of general Hindu cosmological ideas about time. Here we are faced with an embarrassment of riches, and it must be stressed that although the following treatment focuses on widespread themes in Hinduism, it is not meant to rule out alternative, doubtless complementary and overlapping, accounts drawing on other aspects of philosophy, mythology, and iconography. The open- endedness stressed earlier is much in evidence here, too. That said, one fundamental characteristic of Hindu cosmology is its ludic aspect, expressed above all in myths about Siva's dice game with Parvati. As Biardeau notes,'the idea that is most impressed upon the Hindu mind is that god creates freely and for no reason, as a form of play. .. God's play is also play with the goddess: to wit, the dice game' (1989b: 143 f.).This game gives rise to time itself (Handelman &amp; Shulman 1997: 4 f.), by triggering the process</page><page sequence="12">284 ANTHONY GOOD of separation whereby the cosmos comes into being at the start of the cycle. Play (lla) serves as a simulation of the cosmos, and provides an abstract model of and for its characteristic structure (1997: 62). Being a inodel, the game is a reduction and simplification of the cosmos, but as it is also part of that cosmos, its outcomes affect the wider context. The cosmos is at first infinitely dense and interconnected, but becomes more fragmented and discrete as the game proceeds (1997: 63-8; Kersenboom 1995: 61). Above all, play involves a gradual devolution of divinity into gendered forms; the initial ungendered Siva first takes androgynous form, then Siva and Parvati become more differenti- ated and separate. The dice-game story is thus 'an extended essay on having identity of a sexual nature' (Handelman &amp; Shulman 1997: 24), illustrating the key role played by forms of gender difference in Hindu mythology, icono- graphy and worship. Playing the game generates further 'discontinuities within god's being' (1997: 24), as Siva takes material form and becomes time-bound. According to Patanjali the Sanskrit grammarian, 'Time is that through which growth and diminution in congealed forms can be observed' (in 1997: 24); Handelman and Shulman add that temporality is 'tied to the waxing and waning of con- gealed solids' (1997: 24-5). In the dice-game myth the divine form is called martti, from a root meaning'coagulating, solidifying', and in temples the deity's main stone image is also called 'the mit'rtti'. Contemporary Tamil usage there- fore expresses directly ideas about the materialization of divinity. Hindu worship involves congealing divinity into material form, to permit commu- nication with its chronically time- and form-bound worshippers. Siva ceases to be pure event and becomes partly thing-like, while his worship, emphasiz- ing dematerialization through combustion, enacts that process in reverse. Closeness of god and worshipper is achieved only temporarily in this way, however, so worship must be regularly repeated (Logan 1980).11 Like modern western metaphysics, Patanjali said that it is thanks to the passage of time that changes in things can be apprehended. Handelman and Shulman add: 'The descent into time is a descent into difference, into peri- odization ... [It] entails slowing down, counting, congealing, forming - a movement into lineality, into gender, into relationships' (1997: 59-60). The game models this 'descent' at all levels of the cosmic calendar. Siva's four throws of the dice correspond to the four yugas (1997: 5), while at the other end of the scale, 'The squares on the diceboard are the twelve months. The pieces in play are the thirty lunar days - the lit and unlit, the black and the unblack. The pairs of dice are the winter and summer paths of the sun' (Skan- dapura.sa, in 1997: 66). This refers to the division of lunar months into the bright and dark fortnights of the waxing and waning moon (cukkilapak$am, kiru$zapaksam); and of years into bright halves (uttarayana) starting at the winter solstice, while the sun moves north in the sky, and dark halves (tak$iiayana) while it moves southwards."2 To a first approximation, the daily, monthly, and annual liturgical cycles seem to be B-series representations of time; each event occurred regularly in the past and will recur regularly in future, and what counts is their order and spacing. Things are actually rather more complex, however. At one level daily liturgy enacts a day in the life of the gods; they are wakened, bathed and fed regularly, then put back to bed. In other contexts, though, their day is equated</page><page sequence="13">ANTHONY GOOD 285 with the entire year (Merrey 1982: 12; see n. 5 above), so it is unsurprising to find congruences between liturgical day and solar year. For exanmple, just as a year has twelve months, a day holds twelve worship times (Clothey 1982: 158-60).These are not all observed, nor are they evenly spaced; six lie between dawn and noon, three between dusk and late evening, and three more during the night.13 We cannot expect perfect congruence, however, since the third cycle, based on the lunar month, is not merely out of phase with the solar months and years, but has a different underlying periodicity. In lunar terms, for example, Mahasivarattiri festival occurs at the 'darkest time of year [and] the darkest time of the month' (Long 1982: 209), yet its usual timing in mid- Maci (late February), puts it in the bright half of the solar year. There is therefore more to all this than simnple structural homology. Most of the time, daily liturgy seems a perfectly realized manifestation of B-series time. Past, present and future are not differentiated, there is onlly the same sequence of events, repeated at regular intervals ad infinitum; uccikalamn and cayaratcai are always six hours apart, and successive performances of uccikalam occur every twenty-four hours. However, things are complicated by the monthly and annual liturgies, which introduce extra elements into daily liturgy during particular periods. For example, during Tai Pucam and Pankuni Uttiram the 'daily festivals' are replaced by processions round the car streets; 'twilight' (pirat5sam) worship is held before cayaratca on the thirteenth evening after each new and full moon; and the 'holy bedroom rising' rite (tirupalliyelucci) occurs after tiruvanantal throughout Markali (December-January). Even more striking, no two liturgical years are identical. Though events recur approximately weekly, fortnightly, monthly or annually, the sequence varies each time.14 Like a shaken kaleidoscope, every year displays a unique pattern created from the same components, because the timing of festivals is a complex matter. A few occur on particular weekdays or in specific solar months, but most happen on a specific lunar day (titi) in a particular lunar month, or during a specific lunar asterism (nak$attiram) in a given solar month (Fuller 1980b). In short, although events in the annual liturgy are timed according to several B-series cycles, the fact that these cycles are out of phase and have different periodicities results in an overall liturgy with pronounced A-series characteristics. Though at one level a liturgical year corresponds to a divine day, at another its festivals incorporate the most significant events in the deity's life. These too can be correlated with the annual cycle. Kanda Sasti in Aippaci (November) enacts Kalukacalamurtti's birth and coronation; his defeat of the demons, ensuring the preservation of the cosmos; and his marriage to Teyvayanai who personifies the divine army (Good 1989b). This happens soon after the autumnal equinox, during the second half of the dark period of the year, the night of the gods when demons are at their most powerful (Merrey 1982: 14). Tai Pucam in January portrays him as divine ruler of the cosmos (Good 1999), a theme reinforced by Pankuni Uttiram in March (Good 1989b: 189), which also installs him as guarantor of local fertility through his marriage to Valli, the autochthonous tribal girl. These festivals, between winter solstice and vernal equinox in the bright half of the year, express the god's heighten- ing power during this season. But this A-series sequence is superimposed on</page><page sequence="14">286 ANTHONY GOOD a B-series cycle; after all, the fact that Kalukacalamurtti marries Teyvayanai at a certain moment in the liturgical year does not mean he is single before then. Divinity transcends distinctions between diachrony and synchrony, and between A- and B-series time.15 Human and divine kinship In this concluding section, I argue not merely that there are significant homologies between human and divine kinship (scarcely surprising in light of earlier discussion), but also that human marriage patterns display the same blend of repetitive yet changing oscillation as do the daily and annual temple liturgies. Tarnil kinship is characterized by symmetrically prescribed marriage between senior male and junior female cross-relatives; for example, a woman may marry her FZS, MBS or, even better, her MyB, provided that in each case he is older than her (Good 1991). At one level human and divine kinship simply replicate one another; divine marriage is 'a paradigm for human marriage' (Shulman 1980: 138). Kalukacalamurtti marries his cross-cousins in weddings like those of Brahmans; conversely, human brides and grooms are divinized and wor- shipped. As we saw, the god, in however sublimated a fashion, dies and is reborn through marriage to and sacrifice by the goddess (1980: 350). Similarly, a husband's powers diminish as a result of sexual intercourse, and this could even be fatal if husband and wife are sufficiently incompatible (Daniel 1984: 168). And just as the power of a virgin goddess must be moderated by installing her as a consort (Shulman 1980: 350), so the sexuality of mature women is dangerous if not controlled by marriage (Reynolds 1980: 36). Beck explores further parallels between human and divine kinship in Tamil Nadu. She stresses that southern brothers-in-law have friendly, egalitarian rela- tions, so portraying Siva and Visnu as such highlights their complementarity and downplays sectarian tendencies (1974: 10). North Indian brothers-in-law are hierarchically ranked, so to stress their in-law relationship would be to insist upon wife-taker Siva's unequivocal superiority to wife-giver Visnu.16 Despite this, Siva's in-law relationship with Visnu is ignored liturgically when Minaksi marries Sundaresvarar, even though one of Madurai's most popular statues depicts Visnu giving Minaksi to him in marriage. Likewise,Visnu plays no role in Kalukacalamurtti's weddings even though the brides are his daugh- ters and his temple is close by. Kalukacalamurtti's parents, Somaskantar and Akilantisvari, do attend though, as do Minaksi and Sundaresvarar when Murukan marries Teyvayanai at Tirupparankundram near Madurai. Fuller con- cludes that Madurai's temple liturgy focuses on married couples to the exclu- sion of affinal relationships. Rites stress the relationships between Suntaresvarar and Minaksi as husband and wife, and between them and their son Murukan who appears with them on the Somaskantar image, to the exclusion of relationships between brothers and sisters, parents and daughters, and the problematic relationship between Siva and Ganesh. Consequently, Siva's family are depicted as free from potentially stressful contradictions faced by devotees in real life, such as the tensions inherent in counterbalancing B-Z and H-W bonds (1995: 212-15).</page><page sequence="15">ANTHONY GOOD 287 The emphasis in Kalugumalai is on Kalukacalamurtti and his wives rather than Siva and Akilantisvari, but the existence of two bedrooms sharpens the liturgical focus on conjugality. The nightly cohabitation of divine spouses exemplifies a 'countervailing movement. ... reinstating or reconstituting the lost fragments of the god, including the feminine part that has torn itself away'; it establishes a kind of dynamic equilibrium involving 'a female otherness sur- viving in continuous conjunction with, and incipient separation from, the male' (Handelman &amp; Shulman 1997: 161). The endless daily, monthly and annual repetitions of temple liturgy can therefore be seen as perpetual reen- actments or reversals of Siva's initial passage through the 'hierarchy of states' (1997: 163) at the start of the game. These states are all represented iconographically, as we saw. The linikam in which maleness and femaleness are fused, represents 'the initial holistic being'; this highest, most encompassing point in the series of gendered separations and transformations corresponds to the divine form named Paramasiva in Saiva Siddhanta philosophy. The first devolution produces the androgyne,17 seem- ingly in two stages; Sankaranarayanar, where the 'female' half is really a dis- guised male, and Ardhanarisvarar, where true femininity is indeed present. The second devolution produces the married couple; male and female personae are now distinct, yet united erotically and conjugally, as their nightly cohabi- tation and the domesticity of the Somaskantar icon both demonstrate. A final devolution produces truly separate, solipsistic male and female deities, but this situation is unstable and deeply unsatisfactory. Antaka, the male produced solely by his father, persistently seeks union with his father's wife, and is even- tually destroyed by his father; Ganesh, the male produced solely by his mother, likewise constantly seeks erotic reunion with her and is beheaded by her jealous husband. Only Murukan, the one child with both father and mother, appears in the Somaskantar icon.'8 Yet Murukan too must marry to stabilize his position and maximize his sakti, again illustrating that the devolutionary process is reversible. Hindu myth, iconography, and ritual display an 'oscillation between potentialities of whole- ness and dissolution' (1997: 164).19 Marriage is 'superior to the harsh isolation of a unilateral gender [and] Siva's marriage always marks a movement back toward wholeness, even if this movement is later inevitably halted and reversed' (1997: 163). That is why sexual relations between the divine couple are so central to daily liturgy; their conjugal nights in the temple bedroom are partial reversals of their primordial separation during the dice game, and equally necessary to preserving the material world (Fuller 1980a: 326).Though it may sometimes be otherwise in mythology, where temple ritual is con- cerned marriage is the pivot round which the entire process oscillates. Symmetrical cross-cousin marriage provides South Indian Hinduism with a particularly well-integrated paradigm of this oscillatory process. As Dumont argued (1953), this system has a diachronic dimension, that is, the marriage alliances which it presupposes persist even though the individuals involved differ in each generation. What could better exemplify the perpetual devolu- tion and reintegration of male and female than the repetitive separation of brother and sister in marriage, followed in due course by their reunification through the marriage of their children (implying further separations one gen- eration later)? The potentially incestuous natures of the unions involved (a god</page><page sequence="16">288 ANTHONY GOOD A 4-* B 1T T Li- FIGURE 3. Separation and reunification in symmetrical cross-cousin marriage. and goddess both emergent from Paramasiva in one case; a brother-sister pairing in the other) are avoided in the human case through the straightfor- ward passage of A-series time (i.e. genealogical generation) and in the divine case by the pseudo-A-series device of representing the union as beginning at some specific point in the liturgy. In short, symmetrical cross-cousin marriage (Figure 3) presents just the same pattern of cyclic repetition and linear change as was identified in the daily and annual liturgical cycles. Not only that, but it is directly linked to worship in that the priests themselves,'wifely servants' of the deity, marry their cross-relatives in standard South Indian fashion, albeit with elements of hypergamy, and acquire their priestly rights through inher- itance (cf. Fuller 1984; Good 1989a). Even more than the alliance link between Siva and Visnu, which as we saw is barely acknowledged liturgically, Murukan's marriages to his cousins tie up the loose ends by presenting in pseudo-A-series form, one divine generation later, a distinctively southern recension on the repetitive B-series alternations between eroticism and asceticism so exhaustively treated in Saivite mythology. His key role in this reflects, reinforces, and helps explain Murukan's status as the most popular and distinctively Tamil of deities. NOTES Fieldwork was supported by ESRC grant G00230100 and Edinburgh University's Hayter Fund. This article was inspired by Alfred Gell's work (1992) on the anthropology of time. Earlier versions were presented at the 1996 Modern South Asian Studies Conference, Copenhagen; and in a seminar at the University of Kent. I particularly thank James Laidlaw and Chris Fuller (twice) for their comments; any remaining failings are my own. 'It is unclear which of Visnu's wives (Laksmi or Putevi, the earth goddess) is Murukari's brides' mother; this view of divine genealogy is seemingly not shared by Vaisnavites so is little</page><page sequence="17">ANTHONY GOOD 289 elaborated. It is however suggestive that the characteristics of Visnu's wives differ in the same way as those of Teyvayanai and Valli. Polygyny among Tamils is usually sororal (Good 1991: 83). 2The pine-forest myth takes this link a step further; Siva has sexual relations with Visnu himself, as Mohini, rather than with Parvati. 3 Though Minaksi is alone during the day, Sundaresvarar even then is not; his shrine contains a small goddess image known as Manonmani (Fuller 1984: 4). 'Changes have effects 'on or near the things we ascribe them to' (Mellor 1998: 88) and are not located elsewhere or in comparisons between things. For example, an increase in Kalugumalai's fame would not constitute a change in the temple itself, since 'fame' is not a property of it but of the thinking of others about it. 'Note for later reference that according to this schema, 1 divine year = 360 human years (Trautmann 1995: 169), i.e. 1 human year = 1 divine day. 6One form of Siva is Nataraj, whose dance enacts the simultaneous creation and destruc- tion of the cosmos, and both creates and transcends time through its music and movement. It generates illusion (maya), which forms the material world but simultaneously liberates devotees from the shackles of maya and pain of rebirth. This is one representation of Siva's play (rila), a key notion as we shall see. 7In Pocock's view of Hindu cosmology, history appears as contingent disorder. He there- fore opposes the kaliyuga to the rest of the cycle, because it is not just conceptualized as the final stage in that cycle, but experienced as the world in which we live, made up not of ideal persons, but of historical, degenerate ones. (This 'encompassing of the contrary' is characteris- tic of Dumont and Pocock's style of analysis; see Dumont 1980: 240.) But we saw that linear time is not confined to the kaliyuga. It is manifest throughout the kalpa, in the mechanisms of karma. 8Unfortunately, the lack of agreed terminology leaves authors free to adopt personal usages; for example, Leach calls clock-time 'repetitive' and ageing 'continuous', whereas Pocock calls clock-time 'continuous' yet contrasts it with historical duration, which includes ageing. 9Nayar tali-rites precede physical puberty; a Tamil infant becomes a person only when named; and mortuary rites involve gradual withdrawal of personhood. '"On 20 March 1984, priests in Thanjavur made national news by suspending worship in protest against the authorities' failure to pay them or supply raw materials. Kalugumalai was full of speculation on the dire consequences this might bring, but in fact worship resumed after six hours, thanks to unwontedly rapid governmental action in supplying the priests with rice. "'The impermanence of almost everything used in the ritual. . . symbolises the perpetual problems faced by humanity in maintaining constant communication with its gods' (Fuller 1984: 15). 12 Solar movement is central to Hindu notions of time, as Patanjali again makes clear (Kane 1958: 468). 13Kaly'aasuntaram (1980), Clothey (1982), and Moreno (1984) all say this, but their common source is Tiruchendur's chief priest. No overnight periods are mentioned by priests in Madurai or Kalugumalai, though Siva and Kalukacalamurtti are worshipped thrice overnight during particular festivals. Fuller (pers. comm.) suggests that this account may confuse pujaikalams with ilakkinams, the periods of time which the sun spends daily in each of the twelve zodia- cal 'houses'; either way, the point is that there are homologies between solar days and solar years. 14Kanda Sasti climaxes on the sixth lunar day (titi) after new moon in the lunar month karttikam, i.e. the solar month Aippaci. There is also a procession on the last Friday of every solar month. In 1982, Kanda Sasti climaxed on 21 November; the Aippaci 'last Friday' proces- sion was on 12 November, before Kanda Sasti even began. In 1983, Kanda Sasti climaxed on 10 November, followed next day by the 'last Friday' procession. 5The underlying theology varies, however. In contrast to the almost Platonic notion in Saiva Siddhanta, that time is an inferior, second-order reality, annual celebrations of events in the life of Jesus reflect the Judaeo-Christian view that divine acts happen in time, and are essentially non-repeatable (Bowker 1997: 980; Charles Taylor, unpublished Gifford Lecture, Edinburgh 1999). 16Beck's argument has odd features: she describes Murukan as too young to be a sexual rival to Ganesh (1974: 12), blithely ignoring his wives. Moreover, divine weddings resemble those</page><page sequence="18">290 ANTHONY GOOD of temple priests (Good 1989b), for whom - unlike most non-Brahman Tamils - marriage involves elements of hypergamy and a slightly more distant in-law relationship (Gough 1956: 834). However, this is far less pronounced than in the north, and Brahmans too practise 'cross-cousin marriage'. 17Androgynes express simultaneous 'merging with god and splitting away from god ... in whom all oppositions merge' (O'Flaherty 1980: 334). Androgyny is 'a variant of sacrificial dismemberment' (1980: 311); in other words, there are clear links between these two cosmo- gonies, the dice game and sacrifice. 18Whereas lone gods like Antaka tend towards sterility, lone goddesses threaten to overwhelm the cosmos with their s'akti; cf. the ambivalence surrounding 'goddesses of the tooth' (O'Flaherty 1980: 90), or Tamil village goddesses, who inflict smallpox if angered. Marriage moderates and controls this power. '9The oscillation metaphor has gained ground on cyclicity in recent writing on Hinduism (Davis 1991). They are different ways of saying the same thing, but 'oscillation' does not carry the same orientalist baggage as 'cyclicity'. REFERENCES Balslev, A.N. 1983. A study of time in Indian philosophy.

La divinite figee: le temps, le culte et la parente dans l'Hindouisme en Inde du Sud Resume Le culte quotidien dans les temples hindous se caracterise par la repetition reguliere. Cet article juxtapose l'iconographie et la mythologie; des donnees ethnographiques sur le culte dans un temple Murukan a Kalugumalai, en Inde du Sud; et des concepts analytiques tires des metaphysiques occidentale et indienne, afin d'examiner ce que Gell a appek 'la manipu- lation rituelle du temps'. Dans la cosmologie hindoue, la materialisation de la divinite - une condition necessaire prealable au culte - est liee inseparablement non seulement a l'a mer- gence du temps mais aussi a la devolution de la divinite sous des formes sexuees. Comme les differences de sexe jouent un role central dans l'iconographie, la mythologie et le culte, l'Hindouisme offre une ressource culturelle riche pour discuter la moralite et la pratique de la parente, de la sexualite et de la procreation humaines. Non seulement y-a-t-il des homolo- gies significatives entre les comportements humains et divins se rapportant a la parente, mais les modeles de mariage humains en Inde du Sud montrent le meme melange d'oscillations repetitives et cependant changeantes qui caracterisent les liturgies quotidiennes et annuelles des temples.
