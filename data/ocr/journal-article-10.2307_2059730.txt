<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "Self-Animal" and Divine Digestion: Goat Sacrifice to the Goddess KThl in Bengal SUCHITRA SAMANTA lflALI, the Hindu goddess 'Time,'1 is a ubiquitous presence in contemporary rural and urban Bengali life and occupies a historic place as Calcutta's patron deity. Her prototypes go back to pre-Vedic India (Kinsley 1977:90; MacKenzie-Brown 1985:111). Kali was incorporated into the orthodox Hindu textual tradition in the myths of the DevT-Mdhdtmya, or Candf, as this sixth-century A.D. text is known in Bengal. She subsequently became the chief divinity as Female Principle (Sakti, 'Force', 'Creatrix') in the esoteric Sakta Tantra cult, which was especially prevalent in eastern India around the sixteenth century. By the seventeenth century, KMll's worship moved to the public sphere. The Kll saints Ramaprasada (eighteenth century) and Ramakrsna (late nineteenth century) were especially responsible for popularizing the devotional (bhakti) conception of Kall as Mother, the prevalent perception of this deity among Bengalis today (Gatwood 1985:174; Kapera n.d. :7 1; Kinsley 1977:93, 117; Kinsley 1986:116, 125; MacKenzie-Brown 1985:118-19). The most popular KMll image (among many permutations) is that of a naked, dark-skinned, four-armed goddess with long flowing hair who stands with her right foot upon the god Siva. This image, Daksina Kall (the 'South-facing' KTl),2 is Suchitra Samanta is Adjunct Lecturer in Anthropology at the University of Richmond.

She holds in her upper and lower left hands, respectively, a sword and a decapitated demon-head. Her upper and lower right hands make the gestures of dispelling fear and offering a boon. Her name appears on the name-boards of Calcutta restaurants, grocery stores, and pharmacies ("Ma Kall Pharmacy"), while framed prints or metal images of Kali are placed on the dashboards of almost every taxicab and bus in the city. Worshiped both at domestic altars as well as at the numerous KMll temples in Calcutta, Kall occupies a powerful emotional place in the Bengali heart as the ideal and protective Mother. Sacrificial offerings of vegetables and/or animals are textually prescribed and mandatory in KMll's worship and for Sakti goddesses in general. Such goddesses, as the active, creative 'force' (Sakti) in the Sakta Tantra version of cosmogenesis, are mothers of the material universe and complementary to the divinely conscious though inactive god Siva. Offerings in sacrifice are described as a 'gift' (bali), a term that is synonymously used for the rite itself. Also a generic term for 'gift' (also 'tribute', 'offering'), bali draws from the Sanskrit root bbr and (later) hr, meaning to support, protect, and maintain. The compound balidan means the 'offering of a gift' (Monier- Williams 1964). Several Tantra as well as Purana texts list appropriate animals and vegetables (and humans) which may be offered in sacrifice. These texts unanimously emphasize the goddess' pleasure in receiving such offerings, and eloquently describe the material and spiritual benefits to the sacrifier3 (Candf 12. 10-11; 13. 11 (Svami jagadisvarananda 1985); Kdl/tantram 3 (Pandit Srinityananda Smrtitirtha 1981); Mahbdnirvina Tantram 6. 105 (Dutt 1979); Mundamdlktantram 1.4. 6, 9-10 (Sri Pancanan Sastri 1980); Rudhiridhydya of the Kalikd Purdna 1979:371-73, 379 (Blaquiere 1979); Sydmorahasyam 10 (Sri Syamananda Tirthanath 1982); Tantrasdra 1982:682 ff. (Cattopadhyaya 1982). The Daksinakalikast6tram, or hymn to Kali in Srl(rXKdlip7uia Paddhati (Pandit Syamacaran Kabiratna 1984; Pandit Jatadhari Bidyaratna 1985) opens with an invocation to "[She who is] emaciated of abdomen, the fierce goddess [Candil, of flowing hair, lover of bali." In everyday speech, the gift-offering of goats, pithdbali (chagabali in Sanskrit), is abbreviated to simply bali. It is included within the larger category of pasubali, animal sacrificial offerings. Vegetable offerings fall under the rubric of kusmandddibali. I use the term bali in my study to refer to goat sacrifice specifically. My data is drawn from observations of Kali's rites at K llghat Temple (Kall's sacred "locale" in India) and at worshipers' homes, from texts related to her worship, and from interviews with about thirty- five middle-class, urban, Kayastha and Brahman Bengali worshipers of Kall, among whom I worked in Calcutta between 1986 and 1987, and again during the Fall of 1992. My paper explores the cultural meaning and central logic of the gift-offering of goats, pdthUbali. I elicit this meaning from the incantations in the rite of bali itself, my own observations on ritual action that follows it, as well as from myth and exegetical commentary. I propose that a specific and indigenous concept of the Hindu self, in relation to the divine, is central to understanding bali. My proposition is based on the premise that the Hindu conception of deity as Sakti is essentially different from that of Judeo-Christian divinity. Where in the Western tradition God and man are perceived as two separate entities, the distinctions between sacrifier and Sakti are, as I will show, ambiguous. The meaning of sacrifice to Sakti has less 31 use the terms "sacrifier" and "sacrificer" as defined by Hubert and Mauss (1964), where the former is the subject who commissions the sacrifice, and to whom its benefits accrue. The "sacrificer" is the person actually performing the rites, such as the priest.</page><page sequence="3">THE ''SELF-ANIMAL'' AND DIVINE DIGESTION 781 . is ||1 S | | | | 1 - l 1-| 1 R ~~~~~~~ Illsrto 1.

Crucially, such an act involves the intent, therefore the "self' of the sacrifier. Act, intent, and self are necessarily defined within a unique cultural configuration that bali, in act and exegesis, involves. Such an approach offers a different perspective from that of previous theories of sacrifice in anthropology, which drew largely from the Judeo-Christian tradition (see also Das 1983; Hayley 1980; de Heusch 1985). I support my argument by presenting and discussing a theme that is dominant in the different types of discourse related to bali. This theme suggests a homology between the 'self' (jiva) of the sacrifier and the sacrificial animal (paiu), and the "consumption" of the "self-animal" by the goddess over many lifetimes until it achieves union with divinity and liberation (moksa). The following section offers a brief ethnographic description of the social aspects and contexts of bali. This is followed by a survey of the literature on bali and a discussion of some seminal and relevant anthropological approaches to sacrifice cross- culturally to ground my particular approach. Subsequent sections present the theme of the self-animal and its transformation by divine consumption in ritual, myth, and commentary. Social Aspects of Bali There is widespread belief among worshipers of Kali in the powerful efficacy of sacrificial offerings to the goddess, and bali continues to be performed in vast numbers today even in urban Bengal. In present-day Calcutta male goats are the most commonly used live animals offered in sacrifice. This rite is performed on a daily basis at the many Kali temples in the city (see also Kinsley 1986:146). On Kali's annual festival (Kalipuja) in the seventh lunar month of Karttik (October- November) bali is performed at both temples and at worshipers' homes. At Kalighat Temple a daily sacrifice of a single goat is commissioned by the Brahmans in charge of ritual (pladdars). The meat of this animal is later cooked and offered to the deity as part of her daily food offering (bhog). Portions of bhog are subsequently purchased and consumed by worshipers as prasdd (divine 'grace'). At the temple goat sacrifices are individually made to Kali as vow-related offerings (mdnater bali)). Here the worshiper makes a vow to offer an animal in sacrifice should the goddess alleviate a crisis such as illness or penury. In this type of offering, made after the individual's problem has been resolved by Kali, the meat of the animal is taken home, cooked, and consumed as prasdd by members of the sacrifier's family. At Kalighat Temple 700 or more goats may be offered in sacrifice (usually vow-related) on any of several auspicious festive days, including Kalipija. Tuesdays and Saturdays are especially auspicious for Kali's worship and have an average of seventy or more goat sacrifices in one day. Among my informants, about one-third offered bali either on an annual basis at domestic celebrations of KalipCija, or during a life-crisis. I found two variants of sacrifice that are either presently performed or have been performed by them in the recent past: pathdbali and kumrabali (gourd offering). One or both may be part of 4Goat sacrifices are also offered at other Kali temples in Calcutta, but Kalighat sees by far the most in number. No official statistics were available here. The figures I cite are based on Temple officials' estimates.</page><page sequence="5">THE ''SELF-ANIMAL'' AND DIVINE DIGESTION 783 the annual Kal!pCija celebrations at worshipers' homes, although vegetable sacrifice seems to be the more common form in this context today. However, several men and women spoke of vow-related bali they had offered at different Kili temples at times of crisis in their lives that had resulted in a resolution of their troubles. Informants also mentioned three less commonly performed types of bali. One is satrubali ('enemy-offering'), where an anthropomorphic dough figure is "immolated" with a sword on Kalipija. Three informants, including an affluent and highly educated woman, had offered dtmabali ('self-offering', where the sacrifier offers the deity blood from his or her chest) at points of particular crisis in their lives. Another informant, a journalist, had, as part of the Kalipijii tradition at his country estate, offered sivabali, the offering of goat-heads to jackals, animals associated with Kali. Officiants differ in different contexts of the performance of bali. At Kalighat Temple a Brahman priest is responsible for the rites of sacralization of the goat, while the low-caste Bagdi immolates the animal and cuts it into pieces for the offerer to take home. The daily meal of the goddess (bhJg), containing the cooked meat of the sacrificed goat, is cooked by Brahmans and ritually offered to Kali by one of the four main Brahman priests who conduct worship at Kalighat Temple. Prasdd is distributed to worshipers of all castes by the caretakers. Domestic sacrifice on Kalipiija is a male domain, performed by men for the welfare of their patrilineage, which includes wives and unmarried sisters. Women, however, may and do offer private sacrifices at the temple, usually in a crisis, with the aid of Brahman priests. Where Kalipdja is celebrated at the worshiper's home, the animal may be immolated by an officiating Brahman priest or, alternatively, by the senior male member of the patrilineage, even in a non-Brahman family. However, in this context, the Brahman priest, as one knowledgeable of the incantations (mantras), conducts the worship leading up to the rite of sacrifice, and sacralizes the animal and the sacrificial sword. As a rule, bali is offered during domestic celebrations of Kalipaja by those Hindus who claim allegiance to Sakta Tantra belief. However, as I saw, non-Sakta Hindus also offer bali on an individual basis in a crisis. The contemporary devotional (Bhakti) emphasis in Hinduism has provided a historical change in perception from Sakti, the powerful Sakta Tantra Creatrix, to Kali the loving (though fearsome and arbitrary) Mother. This has had significant effects on the kind of people who offer bali today. The literate, urban, middle-class Bengalis among whom I worked were more circumspect about the rite, citing, on the one hand, their reluctance to offer a loving Mother-goddess the blood of one of her own creation. On the other hand, modern considerations of humaneness and the awareness of a changing India that looks upon such rites as relics from a less- enlightened past were used as arguments against the violent killing that bali involves (although all my informants were nonvegetarians, and ate goat meat on a nonritual basis). Statistically the unofficial totals for sacrifices offered 150 years ago at Kalighat Temple (Ward 1822) match those of the present. However, today such sacrifices are presently more of a lower and lower-middle class and/or lower caste phenomenon, although I was also informed of an affluent Bengali surgeon who offered 108 goats at his country estate during Kalipiija of 1986. Nevertheless, despite their reservations, I generally found that most of my own informants held a deep, often implicit belief in the power and efficacy of bali, attested to by their (sometimes secret) offerings of bali in times of crisis. Bali is the experiential high point of the goddess' rituals. A successful bali, namely, a clean immolation with one stroke of the sacrificial sword, is perceived as being critical to the 'well-being' (ma .nga/) of the sacrifier and his family. Conversely,</page><page sequence="6">784 SUCHITRA SAMANTA a failed bali, i.e., where more than one stroke is required, is seen as a condition of 'being stuck' (atke jdowd) or 'being hindered' (badha pard).5 Its consequences are perceived as being catastrophic, the sacrifier or his family being in danger of death and general calamity, such as insanity, poverty, and disease (see Samanta, 1992). The evident power of bali (which I witnessed and experienced) is obviously integral to its "meaning" and continuing popularity, suggesting that a great deal lies at stake for the sacrifier. An Alternative Approach to Sacrifice The rite of blood-offerings to the Hindu goddess has received considerable mention in the ethnographic literature on India (Crooke [18931 1968; Elmore 1915; Whitehead [19211 1976). More recently anthropologists Ostor (1980) and Preston (1980), working in Bengal and Orissa, respectively, have also noted the prevalence of sacrificial live offerings made to Sakti goddesses. The earlier authors note the popularity of this rite, and offer fairly detailed descriptions of balidan in its variants in both south as well as north India. However, they do not provide conceptual or theoretical insights other than observations upon the blood-thirstiness of the rural deities (a common anthropological assumption about Sakti goddesses), and speculations about the origins of such sacrifice. In his study of the annual festival of the Sakti goddess Durga in Bengal, Ostor notes the association of bali with "victory" and cites myths to support this view (1980:18, 60). Preston comments upon the experiential power and popularity of sacrifice at the goddess Candi temple in Cuttack, Orissa state (1980:67), and notes that this lower-caste phenomenon involves the resolution of a crisis by offering a life (an animal's) in place of the sacrifier's own (ibid. 78). Kinsley, in his extensive work on the Hindu goddess, suggests that blood-offerings to the Sakti goddess is an act whereby she is replenished as she continuously gives birth (1986:146). Both Ostor and Preston, however briefly, touch accurately upon some aspects of an interpretation of bali that my own work also substantiates. However, their observations are in the context of other approaches to studying the Sakti goddess and offer little in terms of a comprehensive understanding of the rite.6 What is meant by "victory"? Is one life, in fact, substituted for another in this form of sacrifice? Is the Sakti goddess "replenished" by baliddn, as Kinsley observes? None of the three authors inquires into the wider symbolic patterns that underlie the cultural meaning of bali and would place these issues within a richer perspective. My work aims to fill this hiatus, and I will discuss the points raised above in the concluding section of this article. The discussion of sacrifice holds a position of eminence in cultural anthropology and has a long and varied theoretical history. Tylor proposed that sacrifice may be centrally understood as an offering of a gift by man to God (Tylor 1871). Robertson Smith argued that this is inadequate, and that sacrifice is essentially about commensality-a "sacramental communion" between human and divine (Smith 5In such a case, the dead animal is not eaten by the sacrifier and is either thrown away or given to low castes like the Doms. The rites of sacrifice are begun afresh, with a new sacrificial victim. However, the failed sacrifice may still hold dangers for the sacrifier and his family. 6From an Indologist's viewpoint Biardeau (1984) interprets particular symbolic elements in present-day blood sacrifice across India and traces fundamental links with Vedic prescriptions and mythological motifs.</page><page sequence="7">THE ''SELF-ANIMAL'' AND DIVINE DIGESTION 785 1969:439). For Hubert and Mauss, the victim, as substitute, mediates between sacred and profane, resulting in the spiritual transformation of the sacrifier (Hubert and Mauss 1964). Sacrifice among the Nuer of the Sudan is centrally defined by the substitution of a life offered to the deity in place of the sacrifier's own (Evans- Pritchard 1977:282). Valeri suggests that Hawaiian sacrifice is symbolic action effecting "transformations of the relationships of sacrifier, god and group" by representing these in public, resulting in a reproduction of social relations (Valeri 1985:70-7 1). There is a general consensus (though not to oversimplify these seminal studies) that sacrifice is also about abnegation and expiation of guilt. An interpretation of bali, literally a 'gift' offered to the deity, will be seen to include themes of substitution, commensality, abnegation, transformation, and so on. However, the point of my exercise is to reveal bali's cultural specificity, its particular "meaning." The theories of sacrifice offered above are based on an essentially theistic premise: god and man are distinct and separate entities. Hayley (1980) and Das (1986), writing on sacrifice in an Hindu context, have appropriately criticized such an assumption (see also de Heusch on sacrifice in Africa, 1985). Hayley notes the extreme fluidity between the concepts of god and devotee as expressed in the act of offering in Assamese Vaisnavism, where a devotee becomes the god (Hayley 1980:118, 122). Das, writing on Vedic sacrifice, observes that the success of the ritual depends on divine participation and even the gods' submission to man in order to be revived (Das 1983:460). Both authors emphasize the centrality of the offerer/sacrifier's intent (Hayley, op. cit.: 118), or desire (Das, op. cit. :446) in understanding these forms of sacrifice. Both assert that the act itself is what sacrifice (in the Hindu context) is about. It follows that intent or desire are integral to the act, and must be seen as the "center of gravity" of sacrificial "logic" (Das, op. cit.:446). This is in contrast to the Judeo-Christian concern with the "personality of god" (Hayley, op. cit.) which serves as a premise for earlier theories of sacrifice. The Hindu concept of Sakti (here as Kali), is applicable to both divine 'Force' and to human energy (.akti, in the lower case). In humans s'akti, associated with a person's abilities in general, ideally refers to his or her moral capacity to achieve ethical and spiritual ends. By the same token, siakti may also be abused and used to immoral purposes (the infamous Thugs were Kall-worshipers). Thus, Sakti's worshipers supplicate her for s'akti in their desire for divine strength and spiritual perception. This ambiguity between female deity and human is especially marked with relation to women. In Bengal the procreative potential of women is ritually celebrated at different life-stages, such as the first-rice ceremony for a baby girl, usually at about five months of age, and at marriage. Symbols such as vermilion powder (sindur) are offered at both celebrations to mark female generative powers. Sindur commonly adorns, or is gifted to, the Sakti goddess. The high moral stature of the Bengali mother is explicitly equated with divinity. Possessed of the "force" of motherhood (mdtrs'akti), both Sakti goddess and the Bengali mother share in the "species of mother" (ma-trjdti) within the "genus" of women (Samanta 1992:64). Implied in such an association (or lack of distinction) is the supreme capacity of a mother for love, compassion, and guidance. In the Bhakti idiom the mother (both human and divine) activates io. the child/devotee his or her own s'akti, the capacity to be both ideal devotee and ideal social person. As the Sakti goddess' creation, the devotee already has this force, at least in potential. This potential is realized-as divinity itself-when the devotee experiences this divine force in himself. In sum, the Sakti goddess and human mother are ideally not distinguished in their "substance" and its moral implications (see also Inden and Nicholas 1977:27; Khare 1982:158;</page><page sequence="8">786 SUCHITRA SAMANTA Roy 1975:ix). Their s'akti, present in potential in the child/devotee and activated by an effort on both sides, implies again the conceptual fluidity between these entities. Inden and Nicholas have appropriately noted that this fluidity between "substance" and "code" in the Hindu worldview-clearly distinct to the Western eye (Schneider 1968)-is extended to the lack of marked boundaries between secular and sacred and that in Bengali culture there is "a single order of beings, an order that in Western terms is both natural and moral, both material and spiritual" (1977:xiv). In other words, the Hindu sacred is more a concept than it is a distinct persona. It is experienced as being simultaneously transcendent as well as immanent, permeating both moral and physical existence, and is capable of aniconic or abstract, as well as anthropomorphic representation. It is a quality present in both gods and humans. 7 If divinity may not be defined as distinctly "other," the relationship between sacrifier and deity is an ambiguous one. The sacrificial gift in such a context must acquire a unique configuration-one not easily explained in terms of a transaction between two separate entities. It follows, then, that what is sought-and attained- within a rite of sacrifice between such entities is related to the ambiguity between sacrifier and deity. As both Das and Hayley have noted, the onus appears to lie on the sacrifier and his act of offering rather than on the deity in the Hindu context. What does the sacrifier need to bring to his act of offering to attain his ends? Or, what of himself does he offer? What does he intend to achieve? How does "intent" relate to the gift that is offered in sacrifice? If distinctions between recipient and sacrifier are fluid, what is the conception of Saktif(akti? What, then, is achieved in a transaction between such entities? These questions appear to lay the emphasis on human intent and, by implication, on a concept of self and action. I suggest that an understanding of this concept of the self, therefore what constitutes the quality of intent, is central to the nature of the gift given as bali. Cultural perceptions of religious phenomena, especially in literate societies, are properly understood in the light of the accretions of "meaning" layered on to them by different and dominant trends of thought over time. My contemporary informants' understanding of the goddess Kali herself, as well as the meaning of bali, is a composite of such accretions. Thus, when I asked my informants about the significance of bali, I was offered its meaning in many "voices," each drawing from some tradition in Hindu thought. Some directed me to the myths of Kali, while others provided me with exegeses drawn from Hindu philosophy. (Almost always, informants' commentaries were interspersed with accounts of personal experiences related to bali's efficacy-therefore its "meaning," see Samanta, op. cit.). The exegetical and interpretive commentary that I was offered drew, as I was to find, from the powerful indigenous traditions of the Sakta Tantras, the myths of the Puranas, and Bhakti devotionalism that inform Bengali perceptions of Kali today.8 I was at first unable to find some connecting logic among these different perspectives. Eventually I began to see a common motif in these various traditions within Hinduism. The concept 7See Hayley: "[Tlhe notion of divinity . . . is not the monopoly of the large population of gods and goddesses who comprise the Hindu pantheon and are the objects of worship. It is believed possible for man to achieve a state of mind that enables him to participate in the divine and thus to escape from the cycle of re-birth and attain salvation" (1980:118). 8See Das, who uses the Mimansa exegesis of Vedic sacrifice for her arguments: "Sacrifice has not been separated from the forms of discourse within which it occurs. The forms of discourse are important, for it is in the words that are used, the myths that go with the actions, that we may hope to discover the specificities and internal differences in the sacrificial acts" (1983:460).</page><page sequence="9">THE "SELF-ANIMAL'' AND DIVINE DIGESTION 787 of a gift as an offering of the self (jiva), the nature of this self as animal-like (pao(u), and its transformation by divine ingestion/digestion appeared as a pervasive trope in the "voices" which relate to bali. Parry, citing Lakoff and Johnson (1980:118), observes that the ingestion and digestion of food, as a natural experience based on the body, provides a means of representing concretely the more tenuous aspects of a culture's reality, such as the maintenance of cosmic and social order (Parry 1985:612). Among Hindus food and its processing (whether externally, or inside the body), serves as a culturally dominant metaphor for moral conditions and transformations and their cosmological implications. In the Ayurvedic system food, transformed to bone marrow, then to blood, and finally to semen, is the source of progeny, and therefore essential to human continuity (Inden and Nicholas 1977). In another classification, the gross undigested parts of food become feces, while its absorbed nutrients become flesh, and at its most refined, the human mind (Khare 1976). Food has moral qualities and is transmutable within transactions, embodying as it does the qualities of the cook and/or giver (Marriott 1976). According to Hayley (1980:120), the Vaisnava guru in Assam is the "ladle" or "fire" that stirs or cooks the "boiling rice," the disciple on his spiritual quest. A person not only is what he eats-he participates in the transformations of what he eats. In a related motif that recurs in different contexts, the indigestible parts of food are associated with impurity and its essential nutrients with the culturally positive. In Hindu eschatology the transformation and recycling of the deceased takes place as the moral impurities of the corpse are "digested" and refined by Brahman priests as it enters the world of the ancestors (Parry 1985:614). The recipients of gifts as din in Northwest India are compelled to "digest" the sins contained in these or suffer the consequences (Goodwin Raheja 1990:91). Even the experience of unfortunate consequences of wrongful action is expressed as the "eating" of sins (Wadley and Derr 1990:139). The Radhasoami guru, by looking at his disciples, "digests," transforms, and distills their "karmic residues" while they partake of his superior qualities through the actual ingestion of prasdd (Babb 1986:211). The analogy between food (whether raw or cooked) and the self, and the potentially transformative powers of both, provides a central theme with relation to bali. The instructions and incantations that accompany the rite itself focus upon the objective of sacrifice, the nature of the gift offered to Kali, its relationship between gift and sacrifier, and the gift's ultimate condition as a food offering made in triumph to the deity, who is entreated to consume the "blood with flesh." In the rituals that follow bali, this commensal relationship with the deity is understood in predominantly Bhakti terms, a loving offering that is "consumed" by Kali, and that the sacrifier subsequently himself eats as divine 'grace' (prasdd). In myth Kali's annihilation of demons-by both decapitation and ingestion-takes place in the context of a cosmic battle. She then offers these "demon-animals" to the archetypical goddess Durga. Here, informants' commentary combines devotional and philosophical exegesis, and explains the nature of the "demon" and the particular meaning of its demise by divine ingestion. Scholarly exegesis, drawn from the philosophy of the Tantras, to which I turn for further elaboration on the concept of the self-animal, provides the most complex commentary. It describes the nature of the imperceptive self-animal, and the process of its transformation through 'cooking/digestion' (pdka) over eons and many rebirths as it aspires to union with divinity and liberation from rebirth. The prevalence of this theme of the self-animal and its transformation in the bowels of Time suggests a cultural emphasis on certain concepts and processes central</page><page sequence="10">788 SUCHITRA SAMANTA to an understanding of bali. I explore this motif in the various discourses related to bali. Such an approach will, I suggest, take into account a different conception of deity, the deity-sacrifier relationship, and the process of transformation that is specific to understanding this form of sacrifice.9 The next section describes the ritual of bali in abbreviated form, and comments on the theme of alimentation in the words and acts that constitute it. This section also describes and discusses this theme as it occurs in the rites of cooked food offering that follow bali. The section following traces the theme and its indigenous meanings in myth, and the subsequent section explores the meaning of the pa&amp;u and the process of its transformation by digestion in philosophical exegesis. Pdthabali 10 The structure of pcithcbali may be divided into five broad phases: i) Baliprakaran: a prologue in which a male goat of "auspicious signs," namely one that is entirely black and in good health, is prepared for sacrifice through rites of purification and sacralization; ii) Khargapfia: the consecration and worship of the sacrificial sword; iii) Stambhapzijd: the sacralization and worship of the iron post where the immolation takes place; iv) Chedan: the immolation of the animal; v) Samkalpa/Utsarga:11 the 'declaration of intent' by the sacrifier as he 'surrenders' the offering of 'blood with flesh' (samansarudhirabali) to Kali and her consort Siva, here as Mahakalabhairava, the 'fearsome Great Time.' The first incantation of the rite states bali's objective. Speaking in the first person, the goat desires that its blood be transformed by death to the quality of subuddhi, the perceptive 'faculty of intelligence and discrimination.' The bhdva, or emotional-intellectual essence represented by the blood of the 'animal' (pafu), wishes to achieve that of divinity. The animal expresses a desire to be born again as a man in its next life. A subsequent mantra further purifies the goat by destroying its 'animal bonds' (pafupdfa). The Pasu Gayatri mantra reiterates the motif of the "fetters" of the beast, which must be broken in order that spiritual advancement take place. This supreme gift is then protected by all the fierce and martial aspects of the goddess, represented as goddesses themselves in a series of epithets. Protected and pacified both in its outer body as well as its mental condition, in the final acts of the Prelude the sacrificial animal is saluted "in the shape of a corpse," in which state all desires and bonds to the physical world are obliterated. At this juncture the sacrifier, 9Both de Heusch (1985) and Das (1986) emphasize an approach to sacrifice-in Africa and in India, respectively-from the perspective of indigenous ideology in order to better circumvent Judeo-Christian assumptions when analyzing the rite in other cultures. '0The following description and discussion of bali is based upon my translation from the Bengali instructions and Sanskrit incantations in the ritual manuals (SriYr[K1ifp7jf Paddhatis 1984, 1985). Listed as chagabali bidhi ('rites of sacrificial goat offering'), these draw broadly from the Tantrasdr, a seventeenth-century compilation of Sakta Tantras made by Krsnananda Agambagis in 1982). The contemporary manuals for public worship diverge from the Tantra rite, however, by incorporating some Vedic incantations. "The rites of vegetable sacrifice (kusmandddibali) appear to make a distinction between utsarga, a term used in association with the act of offering in surrender the sacrificed vegetable itself, and samkalpa ('resolution' or 'intent'), which follows immediately and locates the sacrifier in (lunar) time by name, caste, and ancestry. In pdthdbali, the manual uses only the word utsarga for both the act of offering and the declaration of intent.</page><page sequence="11">THE ''SELF-ANIMAL'' AND DIVINE DIGESTION 789 surrendering his gift to Kali, utters his declaration of intent: he locates himself by lunar configuration, gJtra,12 and name, declares his sincere desire for 'realization' (siddhikdma), and verbally offers the animal to Agni (the fire god), Siva, and Kal1. In its lack of spiritual perception the gift of the pasu is inherently dangerous, necessitating the ritual dismissal of such ignorance (the equivalent of evil in the Hindu worldview) by invoking the "knowledgeable" goddess and the sacrificial sword, or "axis of knowledge." This ultimate weapon must be infused with supreme power and strength to fulfill its epic function-the destruction of ignorance. The protective powers of the goddess, written in vermilion (sindur) as monosyllabic incantations (bijamantras) along the sword, strengthen its qualities of heat, sharpness, and hardness, and enhance its purity and invincibility. The sacrifier mentally transfers the sword to the goddess' hand, conflating the qualities of Kali with those of the sword. Kali is invoked here as she who drinks blood and devours raw flesh (pibamananca rudhiram bhunjdnam kravyasamsthitam), as well as the 'maintainer of social ethics' (dharmapal). The "fierce-eyed Kall," like the sword, deals death, as she liberates the animal from its bonds. The third phase of bali, stambhap/ijd, invokes the deities to assure the immovability and firmness of the post which, like Mount Meru, is "as unchangeable as the sun," and the axis mundi of the Hindu cosmos. 13 The post and the goddess are symbolically conflated, and seen to encompass all of creation. 14 The rite of bali reaches its climax at the point of immolation (or 'severance,' chedan) of the sacrificial animal. Prior to immolation the animal is invoked as Purusa (Primal Man/Creator, from whose original sacrifice creation took place in one Hindu genesis myth). It is also invoked as the Brahmanda, the 'egg of Brahma' in yet another creation myth, where this egg contains all of undifferentiated creation. Both in text as well as in practice, strong emphasis is laid on the clean decapitation of the goat with only one stroke of the sword. In a powerful and twice repeated imperative, the mantra commands the 'separation' (khanda) of the Brahma-egg into two as the sacrificer, facing the auspicious direction North (therefore facing the goddess Kali, who faces South), severs the goat's head from its body. After placing water, rock salt, bananas, sugar, and honey, along with the blood and flesh of the goat on a copper place to Kall's left, and the severed head in front of her, the sacrifier concludes with the utsarga/sarnkalpa mantra. This utterance is identical to the previous one, except that the sacrifier now desires divine beneficence (prftikdma). He invokes Kall, who 'thirsts for blood' (rudhirdkanksi) to 'accept [as food, dhdre} this triumphant bali offering' (balim grnha jayam kuru) so that his "enemies" may be destroyed. Finally, four portions of "blood with flesh" are offered to the Batukas, Yoginis, Ksetrapalas, and Ganapati, other entities who are supplicated for "protection from sorrow." Where the rites follow Tantra prescriptions strictly (though I did not see this personally), a portion of the "blood with flesh" of the sacrificial animal is offered into fire, as part of the subsequent homa ritual, and burnt completely, 12The gltra is a clan-like larger exogamous social group that may cut across caste, and is inclusive of all ancestors and related agnatic lineages claiming descent from a mythical ancestor-sage. 13At KMlighat temple the sacrificial post (also colloquially called hdrikdth) is made of cast iron, and extends ten to twelve feet beneath the ground to ensure its immoveability. On theIground, the base of the post is enclosed in a square of brick paved with concrete. 1 The stambha is also called the jupa (Sanskrit: yupa). Citing the Rgveda, Hubert and Mauss note that the "functions" of the post are manifold: it "slays demons, protects mankind, symbolizes life, bears up the offering to the gods, supports heaven and earth" (1964:121, 144n.).</page><page sequence="12">790 SUCHITRA SAMANTA as prescribed in the Kalitantram 3.5. The priest mixes the ash with clarified butter and places an ashen dot on each person's forehead at the 'center for consciousness' (aijn-acakra). This act is especially sought by worshipers at the conclusion of worship. In invocation, incantation, and declarations of intent and offering, the pafu and sacrifier in bali are evidently entities of a kind. The objective of bali explicitly emphasizes the common goals of sacrifier and animal-those of a refined faculty of perception, and better rebirth. The sacrifier, as animal-like in his lack of perception, desires enlightenment as realization and divine beneficence. He declares his intent (samkalpa) and 'surrenders' (utsarga) the offering of himself to Kall. Bali enacts the transformation of the sacrifier from raw flesh and blood to that of burnt offering in the hjma fire. The "knowledgeable" goddess is invoked in the rite to "devour" the flesh and "drink" the blood of the deluded and bound self-animal, and thus assist in its enlightenment. Where in the rite of bali a live animal is immolated (or severed) and offered as "blood with flesh" to the goddess, the theme of alimentation/transformation acquires a different permutation in the rituals that follow bali. Offering and intent relate, in this context, to the cooked meat of the sacrificed animal, and to a commensal relationship between the sacrifier, society at large, and the deity. Such commensality and subsequent transformation involve perceptual ingestion by Kali, and the actual or perceptual ingestion (as darsan) of her "grace" by sacrifier and worshipers. The indigenous commentary on this section of the rites is couched in predominantly bhakti terms. The commensal relationship involves the devotee's disinterested offering to a loving Mother, then obtaining her darsjan and eating her 'grace' (prasod) in return. In the case of private sacrifice the flesh of the goat is taken home after immolation, cooked in a curry and eaten as 'the greatest of prasad' (mahdprasad ).15 At the Temple the blood of the immolated animal is described as 'ambrosia' (carandmrta). Drinking this is believed to confer immortality. Immediately after bali a Brahman priest dips his hand into a cup placed in the fork of the sacrificial post (to catch the blood of the decapitated animal) and smears this across the foreheads of the sacrifier and his family. Other worshippers at Kalighat Temple may also come up to drink the blood, in gesture if not in actuality. They may smear the blood from the post directly onto their foreheads in the region of the "center of consciousness" in a perceptual mode of ingesting the qualities of what is now ambrosia. The blood is mixed with the green-coconut water and yogurt used to wash the sacrificial post, bottled, and given to the sacrifier. The ingestion of this mixture is believed to confer material and spiritual well-being on him and his family. The cooked and curried meat of the mandatory sacrifice at the Temple is offered to Kall in her sanctum as part of her daily meal (bhog). This meal consists of other items such as curried and fried fish, Sdl (lentil soup), khicuri (rice and lentils cooked together), and fried vegetables, all cooked in clarified butter. Bhog is cooked at Kalighat Temple only by initiated Brahmans and offered to Kall under ritually pure conditions by a Brahman priest once daily at around 3:30 in the afternoon. Even viewing the goddess' food is at this time forbidden for worshipers, as an act polluting of the sacred offering. At this time the priest himself stands outside the closed 15A gourd, when substituted for an animal at KalTpuja, is also "immolated" by being sliced down the middle with the sacrificial sword. When cooked it is seen as the equivalent of meat and widows are forbidden to eat it. See also Biardeau: "tTlhe Goddess' love of meat is so well understood that efforts are made to stain the pieces of gourd with coloured powders to make them look like slices of meat" (1984:5, 3n.).</page><page sequence="13">THE 'SELF-ANIMAL'' AND DIVINE DIGESTION 791 sanctum doors while Kall "eats" (see Eck 1981:6, and Babb 1981:400 for the symbolic analogy between "seeing" and "touching"). BhJg is subsequently distributed among worshipers as prasdd. Not only the sacrifier (in this case the Temple officiants and Committee) but all of Kali's "children" now partake and actually experience the symbolic metamorphosis of the pasu. Informants emphasize that the essential and unseen component of bhog is the quality of devotion (bhakti) and purity of intention, not only of the offerers but also those who want to partake of it as prasdd. On her part, Kali "consumes" the offering by means of her eyes: "She looks upon it" (drsti den). A brief legend told me by a priest of Kali in explanation of bali throws some light upon this theme. The sacrificial goat desires that he be offered as bali to the goddess so that he may have a better rebirth. He says to the goddess (I quote the priest): "In a previous life I behaved as a beast [pasfu and am therefore a beast in this one. Today I have the good fortune to appear before you as bali and thus liberate myself from my bonds. I pray that you cast your sight [d.rtij upon my head, so that after my death I may have a better rebirth."'16 The head, to Hindus, is at the highest level in the hierarchy of the body. It is the focus of consciousness, moral discrimination, and perceptual transformation. It is in a crucial sense symbolic of the self that the sacrifier offers to the goddess. The process of transformation is by means of divine 'sight' (drsti), which operates as a divine agent of ingestion: the goddess "consumes" the head, digests the sins contained in the animal that it represents, and refines it spiritually so that it may have a better rebirth.17 Kall's "consumption" imbues the food with qualities of divine pacification, bliss (prasannatd), and benevolence. Drsti is an active agency which operates as an unseen flow that transforms the food-offering itself (see also Babb 1981:391, 1986:211). Appropriately, the daily food-offering at the Temple is described by worshipers as drsti-bhjg (literally 'vision-experience'), suggesting the experience of divine grace and its consequent transformation of the self. By eating what is now prasdd the worshiper partakes of and shares that essence of divinity with which the food is now permeated, and which transfuses him with well-being. Even where worshipers do not eat the prasdd after bhog (since this has to be purchased), a visual exchange (darsan) with the deity at this point in the day is perceived as most beneficial. In the bhakti perspective the Mother-goddess is at this time replete after her repast, one offered with pure intent and true devotion by her worshipers. She is, therefore, at her most benevolent to her "children" and confers well-being on those whose own efforts at transformation are deserving of her favors. Meanings in Myth Upon being asked the meaning of bali, one of my informants was quick to observe that "the Mother Kali also gives bali in the Canqdi." These myths tell the '6In a legend cited by the Reverend Ward, also related to his observations of bali in Calcutta in the early nineteenth century, the sacrifier (here King Surat) is explicitly associated with the animals that he sacrifices, being repeatedly reborn as each before attaining heaven (Ward 1822, vol 111:78). 17Worshipers also purchase, cook, and eat the heads of goats offered in sacrifice.</page><page sequence="14">792 SUCHITRA SAMANTA S _ [ = E _ EE _~~~~~~&amp;--~~ Illustration 2.

Though the mythological text describes Kali as haggard and horrific of appearance, the artist here has taken some liberties in presenting the goddess with an awe- inspiring but beautiful face. stories of cosmic battles between deity (the goddess) and demons (asuras). The demons are referred to as animals, "sacrificed" on the field of battle, some decapitated, others devoured by Kali. In one myth, she bursts forth from the forehead of the archetypical goddess (Ambika or Candi) to deal with special crises in the battle with</page><page sequence="15">THE ''SELF-ANIMAL'' AND DIVINE DIGESTION 793 asuras. Kall is noteworthy for her "gaping mouth" and lolling tongue (Svami Jagadisvarananda 1985, Can.d- 7.5-9). Among all the various aspects of the goddess in the Can4d/, Kall functions as the indomitable devourer of demons-both their blood and flesh (ibid. 7.11, 15; 8.57-60; 9.41). In her first battle with the demon generals Candla and Munda, Kall uses her teeth to crush the asura hordes before devouring them, beheads the two generals and offers these to Durga as "two great animal [mahapas}u offerings in this sacrifice of battle" (ibid. 7.23-24). In her second encounter with the apparently invincible demon Raktabija ('Blood-seed'), whose every drop of blood gives birth to demons of equal size and stature, Kall vanquishes him by drinking his blood and devouring his blood-born demon offspring (ibid. 8.42-63). As aggrandizing, lustful, and ambitious, the fearsome demons provide an appropriate antithesis to righteous, divine power. Thus, Kali's sacrifice of the demons/ animals in battle and her help in restoring the kingdom of the gods has an obvious soteriological analogy. Raktabija's perpetual flow of blood-born offspring are perceived by worshipers as the constant generation of 'sins' (pap). This is a term that, in the Hindu context, may be glossed more appropriately as a demerit acquired in this lifetime, a consequence of ignorance or lack of perception. As 'Time,' Kali is the 'primal force' (ady&amp;(akti), and supremely powerful in her ability to absorb, or "drink" this perpetual flow of ignorance related to birth and the body. She is, therefore, the ultimate protectress against that evil which both blinds and binds in the Hindu worldview: "Kall slays the asura within us, she drinks the pap," according to an informant. In the bhakti idiom, the Kali of myth is appropriately seen as an ideal Mother, who protects her child against moral dangers and guides the deluded aspirant to perception. In colloquial Bengali, pasu means 'animal.' It is also used in a pejorative sense to describe a bestial and uncivilized (demonic) person who has no control especially over his sexual desires. 18 According to informants, that which is being sacrificed as the bali animal is their own 'animal-quality' (paiubhdva) or, a term used in tandem, 'demonic quality' (asurikbhdva). This quality may be of six basic types, called the 'six enemies' (sararipu), which are represented in a number of animals. These enemies' are the moral ones of lust (kdma), anger (krjdha), greed (l/bha), delusion (mJha), arrogance and egotism (matsarya), and envy (mada). The goat is specifically symbolic of kama, indiscriminate sexuality, lust, and general moral turpitude, qualities associated also with the demons of myth. 19 Kama, here as promiscuous sexual desire, is associated with the lesser happiness related to the physical body, limited therefore to being an end in itself and the root of both social and cosmic evil.20 The body is bound by the bonds of illusion '8Apte (1963) describes pa(u as ranging in meaning from 'animal,' 'a sacrificial animal such as a goat,' to 'copulation' (pa&amp;uccrya), and 'promiscuous cohabitation' (pasudharma). See,also Chakravarty (1963), who observes that among the Pasu, Divya, and Vira schools of Sakti-worshipers, the first "appears to occupy a ,rather inferior position in the Tantra system" (1963:52). This author also comments that Sakti is associated with knowledge, and the sacrifice of animals to her represents the transcendence of mundane existence (op. cit.:71). In the NFlatantram 21.6 (Das 1981), Siva declares the pa{u as the ultimate enemy of refinement. '9There is a logical continuity between the association of the goat with sexuality, and the vegetables sacrificed as bali. The proliferation of seeds in the rice-gourd (cdlkumro) are described by informants as "the seeds of kdma." Rice itself is a symbol of fertility, as is the legume maskaldi, another sacrificial plant (see Fruzzetti 1982). 20This theme has its parallels in the Candi when the demon Sumbha desires the goddess (Candi 5.105-114). The goddess declines, declaring that only he who defeats her in battle will win her hand. As the enraged demons march against her, the goddess, all the while protesting her feminine frailty, efficiently dispatches the asura hordes (ibid. 6. 12-19).</page><page sequence="16">794 SUCHITRA SAMANTA (m4yd) to the sense of "separateness" that is all of variegated creation, and the necessary existence of this creation in a linear Time that culminates in Death. In this context the goddess Kall as Camunda, the fearsome slayer of the demons Canda and Munda, and the devourer of Raktabija and his offsprirng in the Can.d, is also perceived by informants as an image of the goddess most calculated to be transcendent of sexual desire. In exegesis, Kall's potential for fecundity and motherhood is emphasized, a different facet of the feminine to sexuality. The textually prescribed place for the goddess' worship, the cremation-ground, is again symbolic of the ultimate sacrifice, that of life and all those 'desires' (kdma, kdmand bdsand) that bind one most powerfully to (delusions) of sexual attraction, and necessarily to the mortality of the body. Kali as Creatrix appropriately faces South, the direction of death, ruled by the lord of death, Yama. The direction in which the goddess faces is the direction protected from, "conquered," and therefore transcended, and Kali the Creatrix is thus simultaneously, and paradoxically, victorious over temporality. Bali symbolically enacts this tension between creation and its transcendence, the bonds of sexual desire, and liberation. The goat offered as bali is seen, thus, to symbolize the lack of true consciousness (ajndna), and the sacrificial sword as the weapon by which this condition of being bound is conquered. The sacrifice of the padu increases a person's store of 'merit' (punya), and liberates it from a condition of gross, physical, and morally degenerate matter onto a higher, more refined plane of perception, as the created being progresses toward mJksa. The Process of Transformation: The "Cooking" of the Pa&amp;u It will be evident from the discussion above that structural similarities in symbolic logic exist between ritual incantation and action, myth and legend. The gift of the animal offered in sacrifice is that of the sexually promiscuous, therefore bound (demonic) self, which, in return for its total surrender to Kall desires realization and liberation. A pervasive metaphor of alimentation illuminates the process of transformation- whether in the rite of bali itself, where the goddess, desirous of blood and eater of raw flesh, is invoked to accept the "triumphant" gift offering of food; or, after bali, as the perceptual ingestion of sacrificial blood by worshipers, the divine consumption by Kali of the bhjg offering, and the devotees' ingestion of prasdd; and finally, in myth, where Kall annihilates the demons by devouring them. That this is a central metaphor for the processes of spiritual transformation in the Hindu worldview is supported by the commentary of two Indian scholars and philosophers of repute writing on the concept of the 'self-animal' (ji-va-paiu) in Tantra philosophy. Neither make their comments in the context of bali. However, I turn to their exegesis since it supplements and elaborates upon the preceding discussion. Sinha (1966) observes that in Sakta belief the padu is also called jiivdtman (or jiva), and is the individual self deluded and bound to "embodied life." Such delusion is the cause of 'attachment' (mJha) and 'egotism' (ahamkdtra). Delusion also produces base desires, and actions (karma) consequent on these. Proper ethical actions result in 'merit' (punya), unethical actions in 'demerit' (pdp). These are deposited in the 'subtle body' (s7ksmadeha) which is reborn repeatedly in the causal body (kdrana.?deha) to "wear off the unseen potencies of action." Such rebirth comes to an</page><page sequence="17">THE ''SELF-ANIMAL" AND DIVINE DIGESTION 795 end when delusion "is burnt by the immediate knowledge of Siva-Sakti, or Brahman to be its real nature" (Sinha 1966:9-10). Sinha's use of the (English) word "burnt" is of interest, as will be evident in Gopinath Kaviraj's commentary (1963). The Bengali word dagdha, which the latter uses in a similar context, is synonymously used to suggest that which is not only "burnt" but also "totally cooked." Kaviraj further elaborates on the "true nature of the pa/u or jiva" and the stages of its transformation in the second chapter of his book on Tantra philosophy. (Quoted words are my translation from the Bengali). Kaviraj observes that the 'power of consciousness' (caitanya s'akti), is equally present in both divinity and the 'created being' (pa/u or jlva are used synonymously). However, while in divinity this power is 'unbound' (andbrta), in thepasu it is restricted by 'bonds' (pd/a). There are three kinds of pa/u, bound by three kinds of bonds. Their individual souls (dtmas), as yet unaware, are bound either by the bonds of gross physical matter (mala, moral 'dirt'), by 'action' (karma), or by 'illusion' (mdyd), or by all three, and are 'impure' (asuddha). Those individual jiva-pa/us bound by all three bonds are of the lowest kind (sa- kala, 'similar to that which is crude, undigested and indistinct', Apte 1963). These progress in stages of spiritual refinement, expressed in the metaphor of 'being cooked' (pika),21 through the middle level of pralaydkala, ultimately to vij,nandkala.22 This last stage itself involves three further stages of refinement toward the ultimate realization of divinity as 'wholeness' (purnatvaldbha). Transformations between stages are marked by an 'expenditure of energy' (/aktipdta) without which the "compassion of the divinity" is not obtained (Kaviraj 1963:6-8). The author describes the state of sa-kala in the pa/u, where all three types of bonds are operative, as one where the body and senses reign supreme. It is subject to illusion and the effects of action, and its body is destroyed at death. The second stage of the pa/u as pralaydkala, where mala and karma are operative, is one where the body and the senses have been transcended. Here, the created being is merged with deity as she destroys and takes into herself the universe at the end of an eon (pralaya). After this holocaust the condition of the jiva-pasu is one of 'inarticulacy' (abydkta). However, pralaydkala beings are 'with seed' (bzjasahita) and are born in bodies again because their bond of karma is not yet 'cooked' or 'burnt' (dagdha). Created beings at the third level (vijin-andkala) are also inarticulate, but their seeds have been totally cooked or burnt and hence they are not reborn. Nevertheless, although these have dispensed with their karma, they retain some residue of moral dirt and must go through another three stages before they are quite digested. This process- of "cooking" the impurities in the created being takes place over eons. The "expenditure of energy" takes place, however, only at certain points. The being moves ahead only after it reaches these points and such transformation (as vivekaindna, a 'conscious awakening') has taken place. However, even "a molecule of impurity" may bind the jiva-pa/u, which only merges with divinity as whole and 'non-dual' (advaita) once this is dispelled. At this point the individual self experiences itself in its purest and highest form as the 'auspicious condition of divinity' (Sivatva). 2'Pdka may also mean 'burning,' 'completion,' and 'ripeness.' 22Pralaya is universal dissolution at the end of each eon in Hindu cosmology. Vijfidna, in its philosophical connotation, is an intuitive, experiential knowing. The sandhi joining in Sanskrit is that of pralaya + akala, vijfinna + akala, reading pralayakala, vijAinika1a. As opposed to kala, that which is crude, undigested, and in parts, akala is an adjective meaning "not in parts," and is also an epithet of divinity (Apte 1963). While Kaviraj does not elaborate on the precise meaning of pralaydkala and vijfdndkaIa, the grammatical construction of the terms suggests their association with spiritual stages.</page><page sequence="18">796 SUCHITRA SAMANTA . :. .. . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I ;. _ .~~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~ ... .. .... .. gm...

Vermilion, red hibiscus and marigolds, a substance, flowers, and colors used in the worship of Kall and Siva, adorn it in offering. Photograph by Suchitra Samanta. To sum up, a process of "digestion/cooking" brings the jiva-pau to an awareness of its own true nature, a realization that occurs in stages involving an "awakening." In an obvious analogy, the body digests food, discards waste products, and absorbs the nutrients, which, in the Hindu scheme, are of essentially moral quality (see Inden and Nicholas, Parry, Khare, et al. op. cit.). In a related analogy, milk is cooked to produce that purest and most superior of the cow's products, clarified butter (ghrta), in which the goddess' food is cooked, and which is used in various sacred contexts in ritual. Such a process involves a progressive distillation of the self-animal, as it "cooks" and its impurities are gradually discarded. This is possible only when the self (in stages) awakens to its potential-each "awakening" resulting in further refinements until such time as the bonds that bind and blind the self to an egotistical existence are destroyed. It attains the condition of divinity and escapes the cycle of rebirth only when it fully realizes its own potential. Appropriately Kall, as Time herself, is the great devourer-in whose bowels the being is "digested" and refined. In the incantations to the sword during bali the goddess is invoked as the "eater of raw flesh," the stage at which, if we use Kaviraj's schema, the pasu is "uncooked," namely at its most crude and bound, most imperceptive. The incantation at the conclusion of bali appropriately calls the food offering of "blood with flesh" a "triumphant" gift offering, the victory of divine over demonic, of perception over delusion. The portion of blood and flesh of the sacrificed animal offered into the homa fire suggests the final and "cooked" condition of the self.

Photograph by Suchitra Samanta. of bali, the demonic nature of the pasu, its sexual promiscuity and consequent bondage to the flux of rebirth, its "consumption" by the goddess, and its potential for transcendence contribute to the central "logic" of ba/i: the self-transformation and spiritual progress of the jfva-pasfu and its ultimate liberation within a cosmic scheme of many lives and deaths. Conclusions The objective of this article has been to investigate the cultural meaning of ba/li among contemporary Bengali Hindus. The questions I have posed were drawn from the premise that the concept of divinity as Sakti (here Kali) differs crucially from the Judeo-Christian conception of God. I proposed that, given an ambiguous distinction between divinity and sacrifier in the Hindu worldview, the onus in sacrifice lies on the sacrifier, his act and his intent rather than on a divine persona. Bali, I suggested, could be centrally understood from such a perspective. I explored this perspective as revealed in a theme, pervasive in ritual, myth, and exegetical commentary, involving the concept of the self as animal, and the transformation of this self-animal through processes of divine ingestion and digestion within a scheme of rebirth. In this concluding section, I sum up the implications of my study within</page><page sequence="20">798 SUCHITRA SAMANTA the related parameters of the conception of divinity as Sakti, the sacrificial gift- offering, and spiritual transformation as alimentary process. The Conception of Deity as Sakti Whether as demon-devourer in the Purana myths or as protective Mother-goddess of Bhakti Hinduism, the Kall icon is explicitly transcendent of uncontrolled sexuality, which destroys both the social and the cosmic fabrics. The pasiu as goat, in its association with lust, provides an appropriate sacrificial offering to such a deity. However, as we have seen, the pasu may refer to the impure j]va or to divinity (see Kaviraj 1963), and contains within itself the potential for realizing its own divinity. It would be appropriate here to sum up the concept of Sakti itself, as this, I have suggested, is the crucial premise for understanding the meaning of bali. Sakti is eternal, and incapable of depletion (Svami Saradananda 1979:2). As energy, she is either manifest or latent, but never lost-merely capable of infinite transformations. She does not need to be "renourished" as Kinsley suggests (1986:146). As the force embodied in her own creation, sakti operates as the moral impetus (in humans) toward spiritual refinement. The self is transformed by its own sakti, its own capacity for surrender, its own "expenditure of energy" as it comes to awareness and the realization of the divine condition, Sakti personified as deity (in the equilibrium of totality and wholeness, or Siva-Sakti). The act of offering the sacrificial animal to Kali is, thus, less of a "transaction" or "communion" between human and superhuman powers (or between the profane and the sacred, in Hubert and Mauss's terms). It is, rather, symbolic of a progression leading to union or identification between sacrifier and deity. The true concept of deity as Sakti lies, then, in the possibilities of transformation between sdkti-Sakti. It lies in the self-impetus, or intent, of the sacrifier-in the process of transformation itself. The severance, rather than immolation of the sacrificial animal, may be understood within such a scheme. Where a condition of divinity is one of 'wholeness' (pu-rnatva), the jfva-pas'u is a "part" that seeks to be whole. Severing the animal enacts the complementarity between self and divinity, part and whole-where the whole is reaffirmed by its separation into parts.23 The Nature of the Gift and the Act of Offering I have suggested that the gift of the pasu in bali is more appropriately seen as homologous with the sacrifier (see also, on sacrifice in Nepal, Gray 1979:81). Such a symbolic homology distinguishes this relationship from earlier theoretical propositions that the sacrificial victim is a "substitute," "identified" with the sacrifier (Evans- Pritchard 1977), or that it is a mediator between sacred and profane (Hubert and Mauss 1964), a life for another life (Evans-Pritchard, ibid.:282; also Preston 1980:78), or what Valeri calls "the subject in objective form" (Valeri 1985:65). Vegetable sacrifice, in mixed popular opinion, may be more accurately seen as "substitutes" for animals, especially by those Bengalis concerned with humaneness. Texts such as the Rudhirddhya-ya describe these as being of lesser efficacy, and ritual manuals provide a much shorter set of instructions for the offering of vegetables in sacrifice. However, given the symbolic continuity with animal offerings (see footnotes 15 and 231 am grateful to Roy Wagner of the University of Virginia for suggesting this interpretation.</page><page sequence="21">THE ''SELF-ANIMAL'" AND DIVINE DIGESTION 799 19), there is need to be careful in relegating even these items to the category of "substitutes. " The homologous relationship between the sacrifier and the sacrificial animal is a necessary premise for understanding the nature of the gift in bali. The pa&amp;u, in ritual and exegetical commentary, is explicitly a gift of the 'self' (jiva). The self- animal is 'surrendered' (utsarga) to divinity with an accompanying 'declaration of intent' (saikalpa). This declaration locates the sacrifier's social person by present astrological configuration, name, caste and ancestral gJtra. It declares the objective of his gift (Kdl!-Siva), and his desire for realization and the deity's beneficence. However, my account of the bali rite, myths, and exegesis suggests that the self offered as gift is not an amorphous abstraction. It is, rather, a gift whose components may be analytically distinguished in terms of "qualities" and "intent." That which is surrendered as gift in bali comprises the sacrifier's demonic or animal-like qualities. This is paradoxical at first glance, but, as an offering of those dimensions of the Hindu self that are most susceptible to material and sensory attraction and therefore most "bound," these are the aspects of himself that require a special effort to transcend and transform. An offering in surrender to Kali must, therefore, involve the intent of the sacrifier to rid himself of animal-like or demonic qualities, as well as to stress those qualities of inner purity and selflessness essential to such surrender. Even in the context of vow-related bali, which is relatively more mundane, materialist, and motive-oriented in popular view, the efficacy of the rite (its succesful outcome) is still seen to be consequent upon the intent that underlies the act of offering. Interpreting this type of bali in terms of coercive and "contractual" transactions with the deity (see van Baal 1976:172; Preston 1980:78) requires, I feel, further refinement. In every case that my informants had offered manater bali, their objective had been to seek divine assistance for some other person (usually a relative) whose life-crisis affected their own lives deeply. Their promise of a gift to the deity was also frequently accompanied-and reinforced-by the giving up of some favored food or activity until the problem was alleviated-as it was, in the accounts given to me. The implication always was that their offering was "successful" because it was offered from the heart, as love (for the sufferer). This, in their view, provided the requisite quality of disinterested intent necessary to achieve their ends. Intent, thus, appears to be the prior aspect of the gift, and is directly related to the moral responsibility of the offerer in his gift of himself. Purity of intent allows for an eye that looks inward, that discriminates between the demonic and the divine. Hubert and Mauss's observation (1964) that the mental pacification of the sacrificial animal during the Prelude (in Vedic sacrifice) preempts later and dangerous reactions by the sacred is more appropriately interpreted in the light of the above argument. The calmed and concentrated spirit that is believed to infuse the animal after the rites of pacification implies the superior quality of the gift, a totality in harmony with itself both in mind and in body. This is, ideally, the condition of inner calm, disinterestedness, and complete dedication of the sacrifier himself. In a cosmological scheme where, over many lives, the self moves constantly toward a realization of its own divine potential, where such potential is achieved by the selfs own efforts and "conscious awakenings," surely intent must provide the primary impetus toward the fulfillment of such desire. The Process of Transformation In the context of bali, especially Tantra but also Bhakti discourse express the nature of spiritual transformation in terms of a pervasive alimentary motif. This</page><page sequence="22">800 SUCHITRA SAMANTA serves as a meta-theme, a more abstract, therefore more inclusive expansion upon the scheme of the bound and imperceptive jiva-pas'u, and its progressive coming to awareness over many lives. The motif of alimentation provides a culturally distinct perspective on the ubiquitously fluid and intimate processes by means of which Hindus conduct transactions in various contexts, in this case the identification between sacrifier and deity. The crude and undigested pasu (the impure self), in a "total offering" of itself, seeks salvation and union. In a theme reiterated in incantation, legend, myth, and exegetical commentary, it is "devoured" by the deity and "digested" by her over Time, appropriately Kali herself, until its refined essence attains the "totally cooked/digested" condition of divinity. The "raw" and the "digested," like the concepts of the pasfu and divinity (sakti-Sakti), are not simply static oppositions but, again, conditions involving transformation, one from the other. It is the process that is culturally meaningful, and an alimentary metaphor emphasizes and illuminates this as the central concern of bali. What if the sacrifice is "unsuccessful?" That is, what if the animal is not killed by one stroke of the sword? The reasons given by informants are in preeminently moral terms: the impure sacrifier is responsible for a condition of amangal, 'inauspicious' consequences that inevitably follow a failed sacrifice. This condition is described as a "stoppage" (atkejdowd), and while the implication seems to be 24 alimentary, my informants did not elaborate on this. However, such a calamity is perceived not only to hinder the smooth (auspicious) progression of life and its undertakings but also to imply a cosmic "stoppage." A failed bali has significant implications for the sacrifier's larger identity in the Hindu schema, with repercussions both in this life, as well as in future rebirths (see Samanta, op. cit.). On the other hand, where the sacrifice is "successful" both the auspicious perpetuation of life and its undertakings as well as a cosmological continuity is assured. The term pdka for both the processes of cooking and digestion significantly also means "to mature" and "to come to perfection." Kall, the great devourer of the demonic and bestial, is, in Bhakti commentary, appropriately perceived by her Bengali worshipers as normative Mother, ultimate moral guide, and most loving protectress against the dangers that lie in wait for the deluded and bestial. In conclusion, it is inadequate, if not inaccurate to understand the continuing prolificity of blood offerings to the Sakti goddess in contemporary Bengal as merely slaking the deity's blood-lust, or replenishing Her powers of procreation by the violent taking of life. This article suggests that the symbolic logic or "meaning" of bali lies, rather, in its resonance with themes crucial to the Hindu worldview, its enactment of a cultural self and its cosmological "identity," realized within a scheme of rebirth and liberation. Bali is indeed about "victory" (see Ostor, op. cit.)-but of a specifically Hindu kind. Such a victory requires the prior and moral intent of the sacrifier, a process of refining his awareness if he is, over many lives, to achieve true perception of his own divinity. Such intent essentially defines the "success" or "failure" of the sacrificial rite. Bali is understandably an experientially powerful rite. Its consequences reflect upon both the present and future self and its destiny in the Hindu cosmological scheme. List of References APTE, VAMAN SHIVARAMAN. 1963.
