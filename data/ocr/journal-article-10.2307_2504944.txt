<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAYS THE PARABLE OF THE TRIBES. The Problem of Power in Social Evolution. By Andrew Bard Schmookler. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. Pp. xi, 400. In the ninth decade of the twentieth century it is something of an event when someone presents a new theory of history. Most thinkers who concern them- selves with theories of history do so as critics, or perhaps as disciples of earlier thinkers. It is only the rare thinker who presents an interpretation of history from a fresh point of view. In this case Schmookler has applied a point of view already elaborated to history, for his book is based upon evolutionary and eco- logical thinking. The central idea of the book, presented as a parable, is that an evolutionary process has governed human history as well as natural history. After a brief and lucid discussion of humankind's movement from the natural order to culture and its freedom of choice, and then to civilization (defined here mainly by the shift from food gathering to food production), Schmookler in- troduces his main thesis: Civilization represented not the old cultural process coming to fuller fruit but a new phenomenon governed by a wholly new evolutionary principle. The emergence of this new principle marks the vital point of discontinuity in the history of life and explains civilization's problematic course. (19) After defining power as "the capacity to achieve one's will against the will of another" (20), Schmookler develops a thesis, quite in accord with both common sense and the common understanding of modern students of history, that the necessities of power have tended to affect human freedom of choice. The thesis is presented in the form of a parable, which I quote at length to satisfy the reader's curiosity about the title of the book: Imagine a group of tribes living within reach of one another. If all choose the way of peace, then all may live in peace. But what if all but one choose peace, and that one is ambitious for expansion and conquest? What can happen to the others when con- fronted by an ambitious and potent neighbor? Perhaps one tribe is attacked and defeated, its people destroyed and its lands seized for the use of the victors. Another is defeated, but this one is not exterminated; rather, it is subjugated and transformed to serve the conqueror. A third seeking to avoid such disaster flees from the area into some inaccessible (and undesirable) place, and its former homeland becomes part of the growing empire of the power-seeking tribe. Let us suppose that others observing these developments decide to defend themselves in order to preserve themselves and their au- tonomy. But the irony is that successful defense against a power-maximizing aggressor requires a society to become more like the society that threatens it. Power can be stopped</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW ESSAYS 71 only by power, and if the threatening society has discovered ways to magnify its power through innovations in organization or technology (or whatever), the defensive society will have to transform itself into something more like its foe in order to resist the ex- ternal force. (21) Thus, there has been a selection for power, for individuals and cultures pur- suing it, in history. The selection of power and the evolution of power in human history have dominated the human condition and made our systems of civiliza- tion discontinuous with natural systems. Even though all of us pursue a great many other things beside power, we are all victims of the process, and even when apparent winners we are all losers. The evolution of power has assumed such unnatural forms that the newest technologies used in power struggles threaten to destroy the very biosphere. Although in a book of four hundred pages (evidently reduced from a vast dissertation) Schmookler could hardly de- tail all of the vicissitudes of the process, he presents a very well-informed and logically compelling theory about the path to the present, and gives us every reason to be anxious about a state of affairs in which a single species has ac- quired the power to threaten the existence of all other species. In The Parable of the Tribes anxiety about human survival no longer issues from a sense of what Nature can do to us, but rather what we as products of our historical civilizations can do to Nature and to ourselves. At the very first, we should address Schmookler's evolutionary scheme. Modern evolutionism opened the way to a nonteleological vision of life. It showed how diversity might emerge without a plan. Planless change yielded a magnificent array of creatures without a creator. A spontaneous and unguided process of selection sufficed. The process had a beginning, in that organic life presumably had to emerge from inorganic matter, but who would dare to say where it was going or why? One can conceive of a natural system, in which all things in- teract, but systemic thinking depends upon human minds delimiting the boundaries of systems. A thinking agent must demarcate a superordinate whole, characterize it as a system, and then show how its subordinate parts or subsystems are arranged. When the human mind tries to imagine the form or structure, not to speak of the principles governing the changing states of such vast abstractions as Nature or History, it almost invariably employs one or an- other anthropomorphic strategy. This stubborn habit of mind has long been noted by students of history. Vico, for example, included among his principles of historical criticism the following: Because of the indefinite nature of the human mind, wherever it is lost in ignorance, man makes himself the measure of all things. It is another property of the human mind that whenever men can form no idea of dis- tant and unknown things, they judge them by what is familiar and at hand.' 1. In Ideas of History, 2 vols., ed. Ronald H. Nash (New York, 1969), I, 31.</page><page sequence="3">72 REVIEW ESSAYS To be sure, we may in the end agree that the order we create as thinking agents corresponds in some way to an order that exists independently, but the dis- tinctly human need for system and the values which permeate systemic thinking must be examined critically. First of all, the system itself is probably seen as a whole because of our atten- tion, and we ordinarily attend to things because they are important to us. As our cultures change, so does our sense of what is important. Second, systems change, and the changing states of systems are described in terms that suggest preferences. But when we try to distinguish optimal states of systems from malignant ones, we are confronted with stubborn problems of reference and value. As suggested by the quotation from Vico, we use models and metaphors to make the world more familiar to us, and tend to measure and evaluate things anthropomorphically. Whether we believe in a sacred order arranged by a cre- ator, or a natural order without a creator, we express our own cultural and per- sonal preferences when we describe some great and distant scheme of things. Thus, when we speak of the "optimal" state of a system, we are not simply being neutral. Even when the optimal state is described in terms such as "har- mony" and "equilibrium" or "stability," we are expressing a preference, just as we express a need for seeing unities or wholes emerging from patterns and con- nections when we think systemically. If we combine the idea of natural selec- tion with that of a natural system, we emerge with modern ecology, in which all living things have their place in an evolved order. It poses no great difficulty for a creative thinker to apply a very traditional aesthetic-synthetic religious vi- sion to current thinking about nature and history. The ecological ordo, no longer a hierarchical great chain of being, but the evolutionary product of unpredictable relationships among a countless array of variables, is nonetheless described by Schmookler as a sacred order. Anything that threatens the system itself, anything unnatural is bad. The optimal states of ecosystems are called "climax states." The evolutionary system of nature, operating according to principles of synergy and viability, yields this good kind of climax, a climax in which both the mass and diversity of life are maximized. It is a harmonious whole and its processes yield synergy and viability, the former signifying the optimal state of a natural system at a given moment in time and the latter its long-term survival (217). But humanity, evidently nature's own mistake, has succeeded in separating itself from the natural system and has created a new kind of evolving system which works against synergy and via- bility. The unnatural systems of civilization are called "corrupt" and "deca- dent" (217, 231). These two words are antithetical to "synergistic" and "viable." Our systems of civilization are not harmonious wholes. Unlike the inevitable conflicts which occur in nature and contribute to the overall tendency toward synergy and viability, those in unnatural systems tend toward destruction of the whole. Schmookler is well aware that the optimistic, systemic vision that he applies to nature has been applied to society by functionalists, but he believes that they have tended to be blind to the long-term evolution of civilized systems. "The</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW ESSAYS 73 natural flow in civilized systems is down, toward corruption. The functionalist view of society as a (synergistic) whole never captures more than part of the reality" (229). Conflicts in societies governed by a selection for power can only yield ever greater and more destructive conflicts, for "not only does power tend to corrupt, but often it is the most corrupt who tend to gain power" (275). Aside from the image of a "gravity of corruption," Schmookler uses the meta- phor of power as a cancerous growth when he describes the evolution of civili- zation into a "uniquely unwhole living system" (237). Both within a given so- ciety and among societies the system of civilization implacably yields competition, selection for the most belligerent and destructive individuals and states. Although individuals and states fall in the struggle, the logic of the system remains intact. There is a continual reduction of diversity and conver- gence "toward a single cultural option" (237). The positive sense of "whole" is therefore restricted to nature and natural systems, even though it appears that Schmookler's logic of power leads toward a kind of whole. It is clear that not only wholeness but diversity is a fun- damental value in Schmookler's vision. Thus, the cultural and political homogeneity determined by the evolution of power cannot be "wholeness," for wholeness implies diversity for Schmookler. The achievement of a global, totalitarian empire would therefore suggest an advanced stage in the fall from the grace of the system of nature. * That Schmookler does indeed mean it when he says "fall from grace" is sug- gested by a quotation from Gregory Bateson that appears twice: "[T]he systems are ... punishing of any species unwise enough to quarrel with ecology. Call the systemic forces 'God' if you will" (252, 263). But if Nature is a sacred order, we are confronted with the hoary problem of the origins of evil, of the radical discontinuity between man the cultural animal, and the natural order. Schmoo- kler is not a Creationist and therefore evolution is to blame. Evolution, a nat- ural process, evidently erred when it created the human brain, the source of that vast human capacity to learn and to create culture. Thus, Schmookler's mixing of a theological idiom with a natural one is a source of more confusion than clarity, for if Nature embodies a sacred order and is both wise and benign then why should it have made a mistake and produced a corrupt anti-system that could turn upon it destructively? Schmookler joins the many learned men of science, the late Gregory Bateson prominent among them, who still see Mind or the Sacred at work in the system of Nature. It is just as easy to assume that nature is neither wise nor benign, malignant nor pitiless, and that whatever system there is in nature has systemic meaning only insofar as we put it there. We are the sources of ideas of systemic unity. Our shifting perspectives and values create the boundaries of systems and define and measure their states. Whatever the correspondence between our language for describing systems and the objects described, however good and useful our sciences, the human act of system building is never mere recording. Schmookler's division of the world into a system of nature and one of civiliza- tion and the attribution of sacred order to the former and corruption and</page><page sequence="5">74 REVIEW ESSAYS anarchy to the latter is simply Romanticism restated in the modern idiom of ecology and informed by anxiety about nuclear conflict between the great powers. It seems odd then, that natural evolution has produced an unnatural crea- ture, and another kind of system, whose logic of development now threatens to destroy the biosphere. In order to strengthen his case for the benign natural order, Schmookler makes a curious distinction between natural systems and ex- traneous natural forces of the sort that cause such major environmental changes as ice ages. To him environmental changes occur "from forces ex- traneous to the living system, as from climatic disturbances and fluctuations" (146). But why describe as "extraneous" (and therefore not sacred?) natural forces that disturb ecosystems? There is only one apparent reason. By way of an obviously artificial division of nature into systemic sacred order and ex- traneous disturbance, Schmookler preserves his idea of benign nature. His sys- temic sacred order abhors disturbances and discontinuous change, but there is no reason to believe that nature does. In current thinking about natural evolution, gradualism has been challenged and supplemented by ideas of "punctuated equilibria" and mass extinctions caused by catastrophic disturbances. Although he tries to distinguish his theory of cultural selection from these new approaches to evolutionary change (235n.), Schmookler's preference for gradualism can easily be seen as a personal or ideological bias. Other students of evolution are quite comfortable with catas- trophe as a principle of change. Stephen J. Gould, for example, identifies sudden mass extinctions as the "third tier" of evolution. Willingness to enter- tain the idea of catastrophic change in nature might even signify commitment to a similar kind of historical change. Trotsky, like Gould, showed little discom- fort when contemplating catastrophic change: The Darwinian theory of the origin of species encompasses the entire span of develop- ment of the plant and animal kingdoms. The struggle for survival and processes of nat- ural and sexual selection proceed continuously and uninterruptedly. But if one could observe these processes with ample time at one's disposal-a millennium, say, as the smallest unit of measure-one would undoubtedly discover with one's own eyes that there are long ages of relative equilibrium in the world of living things, when the laws of selection operate almost imperceptibly, and the different species remain relatively stable, seeming the very embodiment of Plato's ideal types. But there are also ages when the equilibrium between plants, animals, and their geophysical environment is dis- rupted, epochs of geobiological crisis, when the laws of natural selection come to the fore in all their ferocity, and evolution passes over the corpses of entire plant and animal species. On the gigantic scale Darwinian theory stands out above all as the theory of critical epochs in plant and animal development.2 Trotsky found these critical epochs in natural evolution no less progressive than parallel epochs of crisis in social history following long periods of social 2.

Trotsky's words echo those of Engels, who presented an image of history quite as merciless as Trotsky's image of evolution: "History is about the most cruel of all goddesses, and she leads her triumphal chariot over heaps of of corpses, not only in war, but also in 'peaceful' economic development."3 Schmookler, on the other hand, rejects excesses and extremes, and finds in nature, though not in history, the wisdom of gradualism. He warns against the dangers of revolutionary change: "Since sweeping away the structures of order always risks a fall into the pit, it must be a particularly depraved and irredeem- able regime to justify such a gamble.... Disorder, including revolutionary dis- order, favors the ruthless" (282). However, lest it appear that Schmookler represents a neoconservative outlook, it should be noted that he rejects the vicissitudes of the marketplace as well as those of revolution, for the free market too yields a ruthless power system: To the extent that it is set free, the market's action resembles that described by the parable of the tribes. We have seen how, in other systems, whatever has power can talk whereas the weak are compelled to listen. The market is a system that gives power to money, and thus to those whose ways are conducive to the making of money. Money talks. It is not so much that one group exploits another as that the system, by its own selective listening, determines what group will be heard.... That which determines the chooser determines the choice. (318) Schmookler thus rejects both social surgery of the revolutionary sort preached by Trotsky and the notion of the invisible hand preached by Adam Smith. It is no longer possible to put faith either in revolutionary vanguards or in auto- matic institutional processes. The evolutionary process driving history is ex- ceedingly dangerous. Anxiety about the direction of history has inspired numerous efforts to con- ceive of history as a process and to trace its trajectory. As has been noted often enough, some of the greatest thinkers in our tradition have expressed their anxiety about historical change by visualizing history as a whole, a system whose processes of change embody a benign tendency. In a recent book Metaphern fur Geschichte (1978), Alexander Damandt has ably surveyed and classified the rich array of metaphors for history. Both natural and human processes have served as models or metaphors for the "system" of history, and ideas of development based upon both physical and mental processes have been transposed to Nature and History conceived as systemic wholes. Sometimes an internal spiritual process of conflict and healing or a rational dialectic, a con- flict of ideas, is transposed to history, whose development is visualized as a be- nign epigenetic process. Seemingly destructive discontinuities (catastrophes) within the process prove to play a positive, dynamic role. The idioms used to describe the process have changed, but theorists have tended to use a rather small number of models, metaphor, and structural principles repeatedly. Despite significant variations in the use of structural principles that reveal the 3. Quoted in A. Walicki, The Controversy over Capitalism (Oxford, 1969), 185.</page><page sequence="7">76 REVIEW ESSAYS benignity of history and the ideological differences among (for example) liberal and Marxist thinkers about society and history, systemic models and metaphors have usually signified an optimistic vision of history. Any disorder or conflict within the whole finally contributes to the structural integrity and progress of the system and enhancement of the human condition. Systemic- dialecticians, for example, emphasize the necessity of conflict to drive the pro- cess progressively to higher stages. Thus, they welcome conflict, whereas others, for example, functionalists, accept conflicts of interest, but believe in homeo- static principles that yield systemic equilibrium. Whether they believe in violent revolutions marking the transitions to higher stages or an invisible hand guiding the system to equilibrium, systemic thinkers in this great tradition always accept the necessity and progressiveness of some degree of conflict. This accords with the optimism of systemic-dialectical thinkers about human inven- tiveness and human institutional change over long periods of time, and prob- ably in some cases issues from a sense of their own ability to achieve a stable identity and internal harmony despite painful inner conflict. Hegel, for ex- ample, expressed this self-affirmation in a philosophical-religious idiom in which the language of logic coexisted uncomfortably with that of Spirit. Schmookler's anxiety that we are trapped in a self-destructive power-system is expressed in an ecological and anthropological idiom but his larger vision is informed by a sense of sacred order and corruption-a fall into a "logic" of power which is actually a form of disorder, indeed, of anarchy. In view of Schmookler's candid expressions of anxiety and commitment to a return to what he calls "natural values" (139-141) and the satisfaction of natural human needs there is no need to belabor the point that systemic thinking is the expres- sion of a whole human being, with not only a cognitive apparatus, but feelings and morality. Schmookler would be the first to admit it. He works within an intelligentsia tradition which begins with the whole human being and its needs rather than the tradition which identifies humanity with a single faculty, such as Reason or intellect. II Although a number of criticisms of Schmookler's systemic approach to nature and history are implicit in the above, it remains to state them explicitly. First, even if we assume that anthropologists have observed human beings in some- thing akin to a "natural home" (147) we must express our doubts about the ability of cultured observers to make unbiased observations. Second, a cata- logue of natural needs, values, and habits is problematic, because civilized human beings cannot be trusted to produce an unbiased idea of nature and, it follows, an undistorted picture of natural needs and values. As Schmookler is well aware, we tend to transpose to nature our own needs, values, habits, and ideological preferences. Thus, some early evolutionists emphasized intra- specific competition in nature, others cooperation. Third, efforts to measure the degree of sickness or health of civilized human beings have always foundered</page><page sequence="8">REVIEW ESSAYS 77 on the problem of perspective. When Freud confronted the problem of diag- nosing communal illness in Civilization and Its Discontents he expressed his perplexity: Moreover, the diagnosis of communal neurosis is faced with a special difficulty. In an individual neurosis we take as our starting point the contrast that distinguishes the pa- tient from his environment, which is assumed to be "normal." For a group all of whose members are affected by one and the same disorder no such background could exist; it would have to be found elsewhere.... But in spite of all these difficulties, we may expect that one day someone will venture to embark upon a pathology of cultural commu- nities.4 Both before and after Freud, thinkers writing in a variety of idioms have em- barked upon pathologies of cultural communities, but the difficulty in the way of diagnosing communal neurosis still remains. Even if one takes the position, as Schmookler does, that civilization as such produces psychological disease, and that different cultural communities exhibit variations, we still have to iden- tify the healthy "natural" community and a strategy for achieving it. Romantic thought has always shown nostalgia for origins and anxiety that we are moving away from benign origins, and Schmookler remains well within that tradition. It is a tradition which emphasizes degenerative trends in civilization. Like most romantic thinkers, in his quest for the natural community Schmookler prescribes a return to origins and the revitalization conferred by it. The return to origins involves an affirmation of natural values and the subjectivity of human feelings, which Schmookler defines as "the experience of value" (139). Nature has endowed us with feelings that have survival value: We are designed to have feelings to motivate us to choose the course of action necessary for survival: the pain from stubbing our toes induces us to be careful with our feet, the discomfort of hunger motivates us to obtain food, the pleasant aura of love leads us to wish to take care of each other, the pleasure of sex serves the continuation of the spe- cies.... In all these cases, feelings are grounded in the structure of the body and tied up directly with our natural system of value: those experiences which have been survival- positive for our species tend to feel positive and those that have been survival-negative tend to feel negative. (140) Natural human needs are not served by mere survival, mere quantitative ex- pansion of the species. Schmookler appeals to "the experiential quality of life" (147) as the grounding for his theory of natural value. The "plasticity" con- ferred by our neocortex did not at first conflict with our natural needs and values (144). However, in time civilization converted the human experience into a "zoo" (135-136) experience, in which human feelings were distorted into pathological forms. The splitting up of the human psyche, pathological power- seeking, escalating destructiveness -all of these make the issue of the recovery of experiential wholeness a matter of utmost concern for human survival. Yet Schmookler can only produce "suggestive evidence" (210) when he confronts 4. S. Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, transl. and ed. James Strachey (New York, 1962). 91.</page><page sequence="9">78 REVIEW ESSAYS in inverted form the problem posed by Freud, that of inferring from the patho- logical civilized experience a healthy, natural, whole psyche. According to Schmookler, transcendental meditation and dreams suggest that we have re- tained within us a "natural tendency of the mind to seek pleasure, bliss" and "a natural capacity of consciousness to achieve a greater wholeness of ex- perience" which might be an "intimation of our natural state" (210). The romantic vision posits not merely benign origins but a primordial whole- ness and fullness of life that have been shattered and constricted by civilization, but not completely destroyed. However, when romantics construct strategies for recovering wholeness, whether they launch themselves from theology or science, they encounter great difficulty. Schmookler knows that we cannot phys- ically return to "the womb of nature's system" (330). That path has been fore- closed to us by thousands of years of civilization. Furthermore, an intelligent analyst of the failures of modern revolutions, he is aware that you cannot trust the victims of the zoo experience to think or feel properly. Perhaps it is useful to return to Schmookler's earlier metaphor. We are like patients with a can- cerous growth who nonetheless must avoid the risks of radical surgery. In the end, Schmookler provides diagnosis rather than prescription, and a statement about the ideal toward which we should be striving rather than a programmatic statement about how to get there. By describing human nature as part of a sacred order, the product of a benign evolutionary process, and a source of survival, Schmookler distinguishes himself from evolutionary pes- simists like Freud. But he avoids the temptation to construct a dialectic iden- tifying a collective savior emerging from the midst of the victims, in the manner of left-wing thinkers, some of whom, like Marcuse, have overcome Freud's pes- simism by way of dialectics. For the time being, Schmnookler suggests only that we cultivate our human nature, that part of us which remains connected with the ecological sacred order, against the demand of the unnatural power system leading us toward self-destruction. This self-cultivation, this power to "own the core" of ourselves, implies the existence of preceptors who know how to reach the core, who know how to cultivate both feeling and thought and how to com- bine modern knowledge with wisdom and a sense of the sacred. The system of nature has its imperfections, from the point of view of a creature which can reflect upon pleasure, pain, survival, and death, but it is our natural home. Like most romantics Schmookler would like to return home. "Leaving one's natural home, like leaving Eden, is generally a step in the wrong direction" (147). But what can Schmookler say to modern men and women about their roles in a nat- ural home? Should we let theologically inclined anthropologists or anthropo- logically inclined theologians rather than politicians tells us what our place is? It is far from clear that Schmookler has produced anything more than a cri de coeur. Romantic abhorrence of the scale of civilization, its lack of harmony, its instability and destructiveness, has inspired a quest for wholeness in more than one intelligentsia generation and a longing to return to our natural home. The growth of civilization, science, and technology have not made us happy. We are in danger of destruction because the global system of power has indeed</page><page sequence="10">REVIEW ESSAYS 79 yielded superpowers with weapons of total destruction. Schmookler believes that we can choose a different path, but his presentation of the logic of power is so compelling that it tends to eclipse his argument that we still have a choice. At each step on the path of civilization, preceptors in a variety of idioms have warned about excessive growth, mindless innovation, the snares of technology, the hypertrophy of functional reason, and their dangers for our souls and bodies. The counterculture of the late 1960s and 1970s was the latest effort to reinvigorate Romanticism and Schmookler continues some of its trends of thought. However, as Schmookler is all too aware, neither the lyric despair of poets nor the interminable disputes among the intelligentsia about the dangers or virtues of large-scale civilization and mammoth technologies have had much effect on the evolution of power. The groups that lust after power and either develop or acquire the most advanced technologies, including the latest methods of totalitarian political control, have tended to win in struggles for power. Schmookler's diagnosis suggests that we are trapped in a power system that tends to select for paranoid leadership. If he is correct, then the holocausts of the modern era are likely to be repeated in one or another form in different cul- tures. Leaders will continue to be selected who invest heavily in the gadgetry of power, both the political machinery and the advanced weapons, and who know how to mobilize their societies by means of paranoid rhetoric, whether in a religious or a "scientific" idiom. If he has a spiritual antidote for this dis- ease, then Schmookler had better come forward quickly with his next book, in which he promises to move from diagnosis to prescription.
