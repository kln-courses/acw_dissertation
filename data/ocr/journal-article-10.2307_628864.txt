<plain_text><page sequence="1">FINLEY (M. I.) The ancient Greeks. London: Chatto and Windus. 1963. Pp. xii + 207. 2 maps. 24 plates (incl. 4 in colour). ?I Is. This is an admirable introduction to the study of Greek history, 'neither a narrative nor a reference book' but a 'personal analysis', necessarily subjective but written by a scholar who in my view gets almost all his priorities right. My chief complaint is about its length. It is much too short; so much would be even clearer, more convincing, colourful and stimu- lating if Dr Finley had been allowed, or had allowed himself, to develop his views in more detail. He takes a broad view of what history is. About half the book is concerned with literature, 'science, philosophy and popular morals' and the visual arts. This is what history should be, above all a history of the Greeks, for it is not primarily in the details of their wars and revolutions that we should be in- terested for their own sake, but in the political, social, economic and religious conditions out of which developed their astonishing intellectual and artistic achievements and which may also help to explain, as F. tries to show in ch. VI, why their progress was halted in the end. Unfortunately, our textbooks and school and university courses go badly wrong on this. They concentrate on the less important, and also on the less certain; the evolution of Greek thought is better known than the evolution of Athenian demo- cracy, and we have more direct access to the mind of Herodotus than to what happened at Marathon. F.'s aim is to 'discuss and, where it seemed possible, to explain how Greek civilisation developed in its various aspects'. To explain how, not why. In the end we are confronted with a mystery, which he does not try to unfold. F. describes the Homeric idea of the divinity, which some may think 'terribly naive'-but 'what a bold step it was, after all, to raise man so high that he could become the image of the gods'; he discovers here a 'human self-consciousness and self-confidence without precedent, and pregnant with limitless possibilities' (p. 15). Later, 'the emptiness of religion' and lack of an organised church are adduced as conditions favourable to philosophic inquiry (p. I27). This is well said, though not novel. The defects (to the religious mind) of Greek</page><page sequence="2">218 NOTICES OF BOOKS religion were the pre-conditions of much of the Greek achievement, in history, for instance, where Herodotus at most superimposed theological on purely human explanations, and Thucydides swept divine inter- position altogether away-what a contrast, unnoticed by F., with Jewish historiography-or in sculpture, where (as he shows) the representation of the god becomes the pretext for idealising the human figure. But how can we explain the Homeric concept itself or determine why other anthropomorphic or unspiritual religions did not have like effects? It was colonisa- tion and travel that made Greeks conscious of the relativity of customs and look for rational criteria by which to judge them (a point not clearly brought out); but the Phoenicians too were great travellers, and there were no like effects. F. is weakest, I think, on literature (how can he find Theocritus cold and lifeless ?) and strongest, after all, on political and socialmatters. I shall not list rather minor criticisms. One would have liked more on the Hellenistic age which he depreciates too much. The life in Hellenistic cities differed, he thinks, in quality from that in classical. I do not disagree, but would like to add that they tried their best to live up to the old standards, even to hostility with their neighbours; see, for instance, Tac. Ann. VI 42. They had not the power. Lack of power indeed had doomed the polis, as F. shows (p. 88), justly remarking that all solutions of its problems, ancient and modern, 'propose to rescue the polis by ... replacing it, in its root-sense of a community which is at the same time a self-govern- ing state, by something else'. This is one of many passages which deserve to be pondered, like, for instance, that on Solon ('He was chosen by the Athenians themselves. ... He was not "called" and he had no vocation.'), or on the causes of wars (p. 54), or on the role of the demagogues (p. 70, cf. his own important essay in Past and Present 1962, 3 ff., which corrects almost universal misconceptions). But space forbids me to mention more felicities in this descrip- tion of the 'compulsory originality' p. 31) of the Greeks, and of the limitations upon it. P. A. BRUNT.
