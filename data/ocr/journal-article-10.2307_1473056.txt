New York: Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Colum- bia University, I955. x--I-47 pp. This study was focused on the free-play activity of a friendly, co- operative, three-year-old boy. In formulating the study, several important factors for gathering data concerning concept formation ("as learning through experience" takes place) gave direction to the investigator: . . . the "burden of proof" as to the nature of concept formation must rest on the study of an individual (page 26). ... such a study should be conducted with a child during his first five years (page 26). . . . the child should be studied by someone with whom he is familiar and who is familiar with him (page 27). . . . the mother seems to have a unique aptitude for observation (page 28). ... freely initiated play activity . . . revealed many of the most impor- tant clues as to how the child built his concepts (page 30).</page><page sequence="2">APRIL II, 1956 I09 . * . interpretations on the part of the investigator did not become a part of the notebook record. ... The emphasis . . . was placed on what the child said and did. . ... The record included . . . descriptions of the scene. . . . Photographs . . . provided a means of recording ... non- verbal activities (page 32). In the section called "Reconstruction of the Child's Experience," the documentation of the study was presented by descriptive analysis of specific instances selected from thousands of entries. The investigator presented a sequence of four records which illustrated and concisely summarized the evolu- tionary process of a concept. "The evolution is characterized by long periods of integration during which the child pulls together diverse but interlocking experiences" (page 74)- The "significance of process" in the child's experience was developed through further use of descriptive analysis and classification of items. The investigator found that stages in conceptual development "seemed to be sub- sidiary" to the "organizing features of process." Tendencies of animistic, anthropomorphic, magical, and phenomenistic stages, as classified by Piaget, " . .. .seemed to be a natural outgrowth of the process by which his [the child's] concepts developed" (page 76). Self-reference and emotional tones and feelings were cited as "strong initial determinant[s] in conceptual devel- opment" (page 89). For the reviewer, this case study was a convincing presentation of "the essential individual continuity of experience and learning" (page 142). It also invited speculation about how to foster motivation and the urge to under- stand in the more advanced learner as well as in the young child. MARY JANE LooMIS</page></plain_text>
