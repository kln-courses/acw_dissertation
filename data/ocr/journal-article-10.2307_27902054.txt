<plain_text><page sequence="1">KANT'S CONSTITUTIVE-REGULATIVE DISTINCTION My purposes in this paper are to explain the constitutive regulative distinction as set out by Kant in the Dialectic and Methodology, and to note its reappearance in contemporary philosophy.1 The constitutive-regulative distinction is of far greater impor tance than one would gather from reading the works of well-known Kant scholars. It is obvious that Kant himself regarded the distinc tion as being of some consequence, for he returns to it time and again. I wish to argue that this distinction is important historically, as it marks one of the first glimmerings of a problem which has been pivotal in much of contemporary philosophy, especially on the analytic side. The problem to which I am referring is simply this: how are we to regard certain kinds of statements which are, one now sees, significantly different both from the ordinary observational state ments that one encounters in the more mundane affairs of life, and from ordinary scientific statements? What are we to say of the sentence which contains words like 'substance', 'God', 'evil', or 'mind'? Are statements which contain such words all meaninglessly metaphysical? Or should one say, with the early Wittgenstein, "The correct method in philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing except what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science-i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy and then, whenever someone else wanted to say something meta physical, to demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a mean ing to certain signs in his propositions . . . What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence"?2 The central problem for many contemporary philosophers has 1 In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant appears to have two usages for the con stitutive-regulative distinction. One is to be found in the Analogies, and the other in the Dialectic and Methodology. In this paper I ignore the former usage. 2 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, trans. D. F.

It has seldom been remarked upon that Kant too felt this problem. This, I submit, is what the constitutive-regulative distinction is all about. Kant The writings of Kant are often confusing and sometimes con fused. He employs a vocabulary that is not readily assimilated by the contemporary ear. Translated into one possible present-day idiom, Kant's constitutive-regulative distinction is as follows: Language consists, in part at least, of terms and sentences or propositions. Some propositions apply directly to experience, some do not.3 While we hold with certainty propositions belonging to both classes, there is a difference; and this difference has in part to do with evidence. Propositions belonging to the former class the class of constitutive propositions-are in some sense verifiable. (B223) A constitutive proposition describes the sensible world. A regu lative proposition does not. A regulative proposition prescribes. It postulates what we ought to do, or how we ought to think. (A509-B537) Regulative propositions cannot and do not tell us anything about objects. To regard unverifiable propositions as descriptive is always a mistake. (A510-B538) Kant applies the constitutive-regulative distinction not only to propositions, but also to words and phrases. He says that such terms as 'virtue* and 'human wisdom* have practical power. They form the basis of the possible perfection of human actions. Such terms do not refer to objective reality, though they may be said to function as archetypes. (A569-B597) The following two propositions are both regulative: (1) "There belongs to the world, either as its part or as its cause, a being that is absolutely necessary"; (2) "An absolutely necessary being nowhere exists in the world, nor does it exist outside the world as its cause." 3 Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, trans. Norman Kemp Smith (Toron to: Macmillan, 1965), B359. Future references to this work will appear in the text itself.</page><page sequence="3">KANT'S CONSTITUTIVE-REGULATIVE DISTINCTION 625 (A453-B481) Both of these propositions are subjective, that is, neither concerns things in themselves as they might conceivably be known by an unfettered observer. These propositions prescribe only. They are unproved and incapable of proof. They serve only to guide or to reveal. They are heuristic. (A616-B644) Likewise, the term 'God* or 'the supreme being* is merely regulative. Such a word directs us "to look upon all connection in the world as if it had originated from an all-sufficient necessary cause." It is, of course, Kant's view that humans cannot avoid the subreption or deliberate misrepresentation by which this term is used as constitutive, that is, is hypostatized. (A619-B647) While it is a mistake to employ such terms in a constitutive fashion, they do have "an indispensably necessary, regulative employment, name ly, that of directing the understanding towards a certain goal . . . a focus imaginarius." (A644-B672) Kant sometimes refers to regulative propositions as 'maxims'. While a maxim may seem to be an objective principle, it is derived "not from the constitution of an object, but from the interest of reason." (A666, italics mine) A maxim is a pragmatic device. Those who mistakenly regard maxims as constitutive will be led to believe that, where two maxims are in conflict-as in (1) and (2) above-there is a genuine case of factual disagreement. Once one comes to see, however, these maxims for what they are, one will realize that what one has here is, not a case of factual disagreement, but mere "differences in the interest of reason." This thinker, per haps, "obtains satisfaction" from maxim (1), that person "obtains satisfaction" from maxim (2). Indeed, we may find that one and the same person sometimes and in one context puts forward (1), and at other times and in other contexts, lays claim to (2). When we observe intelligent people disputing in regard to the characteristic properties of man, animals, or plants-even of bodies in the mineral realm-some assuming, for instance, that there are certain special hereditary characteristics in each nation, certain well defined inherited differences in families, races, etc., whereas others are bent upon maintaining that in all such cases nature has made precisely the same provision for all, and that it is solely to external accidental conditions that the differences are due, we have only to consider what sort of an object it is about which they are making these assertions, to realize that it lies too deeply hidden to allow</page><page sequence="4">626 THE MONIST of their speaking from insight into its nature. The dispute is due simply to the twofold interest of reason, the one party setting its heart upon, or at least adopting, the one interest, and the other party the other. The differences between the maxims of manifold ness and of unity in nature thus easily allow of reconciliation. So long, however, as the maxims are taken as yielding objective in sight, and until a way has been discovered of adjusting their con flicting claims, and of satisfying reason in that regard, they will not only give rise to disputes but will be a positive hindrance and cause long delays in the discovery of truth. (A667-B695, A668-B696) It is important to notice that, according to Kant, these regu lative terms and propositions contribute indirectly to the extension of empirical knowledge. They do this without being in a position to run counter to empirical knowledge. Thus we have Kant's transcendental deduction of all ideas of speculative reason . . . whereby this empirical knowledge is more adequately secured with in its own limits and more effectively improved than would be pos sible, in the absence of such ideas [regulative principles], through the employment merely of the principles of the understanding. (A671-B699) For example: The method of looking for order in nature . . . and the maxim which prescribes that we regard such order-leaving, however, un determined where and how far-as grounded in nature as such, is certainly a legitimate and excellent regulative principle of reason. In this regulative capacity it goes far beyond what experience or observation can verify; and though not itself determining anything, yet serves to mark out a path ... (A668-B696) Kant of course does not think of regulative concepts and propo sitions as a rough aggregate, any more than he thought the cate gories were such. Kant holds that there are logical reasons (see the transcendental deduction) which make some regulative ideas essential, and that a precise catalogue of them could be made. It is not the case, then, that for Kant, every unverifiable proposition is regulative. An idea or principle is not called 'regulative' because it is unverifiable; it is called this because it directs the understand ing, or regulates in some essential way. It is paradigmatic, not because it is nondenotative or nonverifiable, but because it regulates.</page><page sequence="5">KANT'S CONSTITUTIVE-REGULATIVE DISTINCTION 627 While it is the case that there are many nondenotative and nonverifiable propositions that Kant would not call 'regulative', it is nevertheless interesting and suggestive to notice that all of the (according to him) regulative principles are nondenotative and nonverifiable. And he does not dismiss such propositions-he does not, for example, call them meaningless-he says that they are use ful and important; indeed, they are somehow necessary. Thus Kant has noticed that there are nondenotative, unverifiable propositions, and that some at least of these propositions can, nevertheless, have legitimate and important usages. These are 'discoveries' that one generally associates with the twentieth century. The genericism-gradualism distinction, evolved in the context of discussions of the synthetic a priori, can also be applied here. Kant is clearly a genericist when it comes to saying which propositions are synthetic a priori, and he is also a genericist in the matter of regulative propositions. But it does not follow that the contempo rary student should opt for genericism; nor does it follow that, in thinking about the notion of regulativity, genericism is closer to the truth. Might it not be interesting to extend Kant's use of 'regulative' to cover any proposition which, while being nonde notative and unverifiable, also has a legitimate and significant usage? Such propositions, whatever one calls them, have certainly acted as catalyst for a great many present-day philosophers. In the sections that follow I hope to show that Kant and certain representative contemporary philosophers share a common con cern for statements which are nondenotative, unverifiable, and in some sense useful. Mind Kant holds that some at least of the propositions involving talk about the mind are regulative propositions. Rejecting the view first expressed in modern philosophy by Descartes, Kant says that "we must proceed as if the mind were a simple substance which persists with personal identity (in this life at least)." (A672-B700) One would not, says Kant, be justified in assuming "thought entities," because we cannot hope to extend our knowledge beyond the object of possible experience. (A674-B702) According to Kant, when one sets out to investigate the 'I* itself, one must restrict oneself to experience. But experience re veals no such thing as a thinking substance or soul. Thus, talk of a</page><page sequence="6">628 THE MONIST simple, self-subsisting intelligence is nothing more than a maxim used to regard all mental phenomena as existing in a single subject, all powers, so far as possible, as derived from a single fundamental power, all change as belonging to the state of one and the same permanent being, and all appearances in space as completely different from the action of thought. But we must remember that we are working on the regulative level only. "No windy hypotheses of generation, extinction, and palin genesis of souls will be permitted." (A682-B710, A683-B711) It is noteworthy how much Ryle's basic approach reflects Kant's constitutive-regulative distinction. Like Kant, Ryle rejects the be lief that minds are things, but different sorts of things from bodies. To think that the word 'mind* denotes a distinct entity (of what ever kind) is to make what Ryle calls "the Cartesian category mistake." To make a category-mistake is to allocate a concept to a logical type to which it does not belong. The word 'mind' is not of the same logical type as those nouns that can be used ostensively. This is exactly the same point that Kant noticed, though Kant described his finding in quite different language. As Ryle puts the matter, 'Mind' is not the name of another person, working or frolicking behind an impenetrable screen; it is not the name of another place where the work is done or games are played; and it is not the name of another tool with which work is done, or another appliance with which games are played.4 I do not wish to exaggerate the similarity between Ryle and Kant. Ryle asserts dogmatically that the word 'mind* does not denote a separate entity; whereas Kant's claim is that, if 'mind* denotes a nonphysical substance, we do not know this. Neverthe less, both philosophers agree (Ryle reluctantly) that it is necessary or convenient at times to employ this term. In other words, these philosophers agree that propositions involving the term 'mind* are not constitutive. Ryle writes: Though it is not always convenient to avoid the practice, there is a considerable logical hazard in using the nouns 'mind' and 'minds' 4 Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind (London: Hutchinson's, 1955), p. 51. Here inafter cited as CM.</page><page sequence="7">KANT'S CONSTITUTIVE-REGULATIVE DISTINCTION 629 at all. The idiom makes it too easy to construct logically improper conjunctions, disjunctions, and cause-effect propositions, such as 'so and-so took place not in my body but in my mind', 'my mind made my hand write', and 'a person's body and mind interact upon each other' and so on.5 It is obvious that Ryle does not have the same pro-attitude that Kant does towards 'mind* in its regulative capacity. They are, nevertheless, in agreement that some at least of the propositions involving this term are no more than regulative.6 God Bultmann, Bonhoeffer, Tillich, and the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich-these men have, each in his own not always self-con sistent way, reflected the Kantian claim that the central utterances of theology are merely regulative. The same is true, though in a less spectacular fashion, of theologians writing in the analytic tra dition, for example, R. B. Braithwaite. According to Kant, God is a "mere something in idea, of which, as it may be in itself, we have no concept." We "can never form the slightest concept of it." (A697-B707) The existence of a supreme being is postulated so that we may view the things of this world "as if they had their ground in such a being." "We misappre hend the meaning of this idea if we regard it as the assertion, or even as the assumption of a real thing..." (A681-B709) One gardener says: "Look at the way these are arranged. There is purpose and a feeling for beauty here. I believe that someone comes, someone invisible to mortal eyes. I believe that the more carefully we look the more we shall find confirmation of this." The other gardener says: "I don't."7 Of John Wisdom's gardeners, Kant says: "Each believes that his judgment has been arrived at through insight into the object, whereas it really rests entirely on the greater or lesser attachment to one of the two principles." 5 Ryle, CM, p. 168. 6 Perhaps one should note in passing that in Ryle the closest counterparts to Kant's notion of regulativity are decisions about the logical or grammatical geog raphy of a set of terms. 7 John Wisdom, "Gods," Philosophy and Psycho-Analysis (Oxford: Blackwell, 1957), p. 155.</page><page sequence="8">630 THE MONIST (A667-B695) To Wisdom's first gardener, Kant would say, the things of the world must be viewed "as if they had received their existence from a highest intelligence," but this is "a heuristic not an ostensive concept." (A671-B699) Kant sees talk about God as merely regulative, and he applies the same analysis to other religious notions. The devil: So it is not surprising that an Apostle represents this invisible enemy, who is known only through his operations upon us and who destroys basic principles, as being outside us and, indeed, as an evil spirit. . . This is an expression which seems to have been used not to extend our knowledge beyond the world of sense, but only to make clear for practical use the conception of what is for us un fathomable.8 The fact that we have to hypostatize religious ideas and sometimes conceive them "in human guise" is a "limitation of human rea son." Religious maxims are a product of having to "resort to some analogy to natural existences"; but to regard these maxims as extensions of our knowledge "is anthropomorphism, which has, from the moral point of view (in religion), most injurious conse quences." 9 Kant even discusses the idea of the virgin birth. He points out that the story is understandable from a practical or moral point of view, as it allows us to conceive the possibility of a person free from the propensity to evil. On the other hand, he says in under statement, "the idea is not without difficulty in theory." He con cludes: "Yet of what use is all this theory pro and con when it suffices for practical purposes to place before us as a pattern this idea taken as a symbol.. ."10 According to the Bishop of Woolwich, questions such as whether the tomb was empty or not, the virgin birth, the Ascension, and so on, these are "secondary questions."

There is, of course, a core of history in Christianity, and that Christ was born in Bethlehem is a historical statement. But there's a difference between historical and theological statements. That Christ was the Son of God is a theological statement, and the way the Gospel writers used it was their expression-their representation-of the life of Jesus.11 Tillich: Symbols are representations. Bread is something to eat; it's not the body of Christ. It's a symbol of His sacrifice. Grape is something I suck, and wine is something I drink; it isn't the blood of Christ literally. All statements in the New Testament are symbolic in the sense that they are analogues, parables, and we have to interpret them in an existential way. By 'existential way' I mean that peo ple's lives are different at different times and the Bible has to be re-interpreted each time according to the situation in which people find themselves.12 Bonhoeffer's religionless Christianity: There is no longer any need for God as a working hypothesis, whether in morals, politics, or science. Nor is there any need for such a God in religion or philosophy (Feuerbach). In the name of intellectual honesty these working hypotheses should be dropped or dispensed with as far as possible. This sounds, of course, as though Bonhoeffer had departed alto gether from Kant. But he has not. In spite of many passages like the above, Bonhoeffer, in his writing, continues to employ what can only be regarded as regulative propositions involving 'God*. Man must plunge himself into the life of a godless world, without attempting to gloss over its ungodliness with a veneer of religion or trying to transfigure it. He must live a 'worldly' life and so participate in the suffering of God ... Just one more point for today. When we speak of God in a non-religious way, we must not gloss over the ungodli ness of the world, but expose it in a new light.

Like Kant, Braithwaite is, by ex plicit declaration, an empiricist. Like Kant, Braithwaite recognizes the impossibility of regarding religious and moral statements as verifiable propositions. It is Braithwaite^ view that the "typical" use of religious assertions is-not factual or descriptive, but-"to announce allegiance to a set of moral principles."14 To make a religious assertion is (a) to express an intention to act in accordance with the specified policy of behavior of (say) Christianity, if one is a Christian; and (b) to refer, directly or in directly, to a story (what many recent writers have called myth). The reference to the story is not an assertion of the story taken as a matter of empirical fact ... to assert the whole set of assertions of the Christian religion is both to tell the Christian doctrinal story and to confess allegiance to the Christian way of life.15 Braithwaite makes it clear, it should be said, that he regards his view as holding true of other religions as well as Christianity. Educated Christians of the present day who attach importance to the doctrine of the Atonement certainly do not believe an empiri cally testable story . . . What I am calling a story Matthew Arnold called a parable and a fairy tale. Other terms which might be used are allegory, fable, tale, myth . . . Stories about the beginning of the world and of the Last Judgment as facts of past or of future history are believed by many unsophisticated Christians. But my contention is that belief in the truth of the Christian stories is not the proper criterion for deciding whether or not an assertion is a Christian one. A man is not, I think, a professing Christian unless he both proposes to live according to Christian moral principles and associates his intention with thinking of Christian stories; but 13 Mehta, "New Theol."

View," p. 435.</page><page sequence="11">KANT'S CONSTITUTIVE-REGULATIVE DISTINCTION 633 he need not believe that the empirical propositions presented by the stories correspond to empirical fact.16 Ethics The entire development of twentieth-century Anglo-American moral philosophy can be viewed rewardingly from the point of view of Kant's constitutive-regulative distinction. Most traditional moral philosophers from Plato and Aristotle through St. Thomas and Spinoza to Bentham and Mill have proceeded on the assumption that ethical propositions are mutatis mutandis constitutive. Most have held that only if ethical terms are given a meaning by refer ence to entities and properties that are discoverable in experience of one sort or another, can we deal with moral issues efficiently. G. E. Moore, realizing with Kant that moral judgments are not constitutive in any empirical way, nevertheless felt that moral terms must refer to some sort of entities or properties. Thus, he concluded that 'good* denotes some non-natural property. Even G. E. Moore, then, could not bring himself to see ethical language as merely regulative. The same is true of the other intuitionists, Ross and Ewing. The now fairly widely accepted belief that moral propositions are regulative in the extended sense of this term can be seen to have originated, in this century, with such philosophers as Ayer, Carnap and Stevenson. Ayer pictured an ethical expression as pri marily an ejaculation, or a venting of the emotion of the speaker. The presence of an ethical term, such as 'right*, in a sentence, adds nothing to the factual content of the sentence. To say, 'It was right of you to keep your promise', simply means, 'You kept your promise. Hurrah!' Nor is it legitimate to think of ethical proposi tions as describing the feelings of the speaker. If they did, they would be constitutive. They do not describe the feelings of the speaker, they express the feelings of the speaker. And they can also be used to arouse feeling in a hearer. The emotive position of Ayer (and others) was given its most elaborate development by C. L. Stevenson. He provides us with a subtler (than Ayer, or Kant) analysis of the regulative functioning of ethical language. It is Stevenson's view that there are roughly 16 Braithwaite, "Empir. View," p. 436f.</page><page sequence="12">634 THE MONIST two kinds of disagreement. The one is concerned with how matters are truthfully to be described and explained-disagreement involv ing constitutive propositions. The second is concerned with how matters are to be favored or disfavored. Such disagreements pri marily involve differences of attitude, rather than factual belief. In Kant's language, such disagreements will be seen to evince regu lative language. It is by no means the case that every argument represents one sort of disagreement to the exclusion of the other. There is often dis agreement of both sorts. This is to say little more than that our beliefs and attitudes must not be compartmentalized. Our attitudes, as many have pointed out, often affect our beliefs, not only by caus ing us to indulge in wishful thinking, but also by leading us to develop and check such beliefs as point out the means of getting what we want. And conversely, our beliefs often affect our atti tudes; for we may alter our form of approval of something when we change our beliefs about its nature.17 After Stevenson, and after the publication of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, a host of English-speaking moral philosophers turn to the analysis of what, in this context, I have been referring to as regulative language. Foremost amongst these are perhaps Hare and Nowell-Smith. What these philosophers have done is reveal to us an immense variety of kinds of regulative utter ance. As he begins his task of analysis, Nowell-Smith, like the other philosophers already mentioned, writes a passage reminiscent of Kant. We must now begin to ... try to understand the role of practical discourse by studying the purposes for which it is used rather than by trying to discover (or invent) entities to which the words used in it refer . . . To say that something is good, we are now told, is not to make a statement about it or to describe it, but to express a desire for or an attitude towards it, to express approval of it, to grade it, to praise it, to commend it, and so on.18 17 C.

Nowell-Smith, Ethics (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1959), p. 95.</page><page sequence="13">KANT'S CONSTITUTIVE-REGULATIVE DISTINCTION 635 Wittgenstein and Austin Many of the philosophers whom I have mentioned, though by no means all, owe a debt not only to Kant, but also to Wittgenstein. While the debt to Kant, so far as I know, has seldom been acknowl edged (hence the rationale for this paper), most writers do acknowledge the contribution of Wittgenstein. What the later Wittgenstein did was to free people from the assumption that language, in order to be meaningful, must denote entities exist ing in one realm or another. According to Wittgenstein, the word 'meaning* is being used illicitly if it is used to signify a thing that in one way or another is said to correspond to the word. The mean ing (s) of a word is not a denoted object, but the way (s) the word is used in the language.19 I think that it would perhaps not be too much to claim that with his constitutive-regulative distinction Kant came more than halfway toward this truth noticed by Witt genstein. Up to the present, no philosopher has done more to throw light on the regulative than Austin. In fact, it is tempting to regard Austin's constative-performative distinction as being the exact parallel of the Kantian distinction here under discussion. I think that it would perhaps be true to say that the class of statements referred to by Kant as constitutive and the class of statements re ferred to by Austin as constative would, to a large extent, overlap. According to Austin, a constative is, amongst other things, a straightforward statement of fact, either true or false. "To issue a constative utterance (i.e. to utter it with a historical reference) is to make a statement."20 Nevertheless, statements are only typical or paradigm cases of constatives. There are, Austin claims, many qualifications to be made. The distinction between performative and constative is the distinction between doing and saying.21 To issue a performative utterance is, for example, to make a promise, or a bet. io Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, trans. G.E.M. Anscombe (Oxford: Blackwell, 1953), #40 and #43. 20 J. L. Austin, How To Do Things With Words (New York: Oxford University Press, 1965), p. 6n. Hereinafter cited as HTDT. 21 Austin, HTDT, p. 47.</page><page sequence="14">636 THE MONIST The uttering of the words, is, indeed, usually a, or even the, leading incident in the performance of the act (of betting or whatnot), the performance of which is also the object of the utterance, but it is far from being usually, even if it is ever, the sole thing necessary if the act is to be deemed to have been performed.22 Austin introduces another set of categories for his analysis of speech acts. To perform a "locutionary act" is to utter "a certain sentence with a certain sense and reference." Then there are "illo cutionary acts," "such as informing, ordering, warning, undertak ing, etc., i.e., utterances which may have a certain (conventional) force." A "perlocutionary act" is "what we bring about or achieve by saying something, such as convincing, persuading, deterring."23 Here again it is tempting to make an equation where it would not be legitimate to do so. It is tempting to regard the class of con statives as being the same as the class of locutionary acts, and the class of performatives as being the same as (say) the class of illocutionary acts. But, in fact, as Austin points out, stating and describing are two of the many illocutionary acts.24 The fact of the matter is that one of the aims of Austin's work is "to play Old Harry with two fetishes which I admit to an inclina tion to play Old Harry with, viz. (1) the true/false fetish, (2) the value/fact fetish."2^ Thus it seems that while some at least of Austin's distinctions are similar to Kant's constitutive-regulative distinction, Austin's aim is to undo the work of Kant and others. What are the apparent similarities beween Kant and Austin? As has been said, the constitutive and the constative may be roughly coextensive. It would be a mistake to equate the regulative with the performative. While these categories are not entirely dissimilar, Kant did not notice the performative aspect of language as such, i.e. he did not see certain utterances as the doing of an act. Again, to make a constitutive statement may be to perform a locutionary act and possibly an illocutionary act; and Austin's description of perlocutionary acts bears a certain interesting resemblance to Kant's 22 Austin, HTDT, p. 8. 23 Austin, HTDT, p. 108. 24 Austin, HTDT, p. 147f. 25 Austin, HTDT, p. 150.</page><page sequence="15">KANT'S CONSTITUTIVE-REGULATIVE DISTINCTION 637 descriptive of regulative statements. But I do not find an iso morphism anywhere here. Nevertheless, it may be felt that if Austin is successful in dis crediting the fact/value and true/false "fetishes," Kant's distinction will be seriously undermined. Austin sets out to find some precise way in which to distinguish the performative from the constative utterance. Austin looks for a criterion or criteria of grammar. He finds that there is no one absolute criterion of this kind: and that very probably it is not possible to lay down even a list of all possible criteria; more over, they certainly would not distinguish performatives from con statives as very commonly the same sentence is used on different occasions of utterance in both ways, performative and constative. The thing seems hopeless from the start, if we are to leave utter ances as they stand and seek for a criterion.26 This, of course, is an important point to notice. Austin is carrying out a descriptive study of how sentences are used. His claim is that, from a mere study of actual use, we cannot say of any given sentence that we somehow know that its primary or primitive use is state mental or constative.27 Austin "plays Old Harry" with the fact/value fetish and the true/false fetish on the basis of a descriptive look at the way in which sentences are used. His claim is that any given constative can be seen to have a performative side. The same flexibility of use is true of performatives. Does this mean that Austin has shown Kant's constitutive-regulative distinction to be wrong-headed? I think not. Kant was perfectly well aware that regulative propositions (including here some at least of the sentences that Austin would call performative) are used by most people in a constitutive way. Kant's claim was that amongst the propositions that are ordinarily used in a constitutive way, some ought not to be so used. Those that ought not to be used as constitutives are those which are unverifiable. Thus, if I understand Austin correctly, he is saying that ethical propositions, for example, or propositions about (say) 26 Austin, HTDT, p. 67. 27 Austin, HTDT, p. 72, and p. 91.</page><page sequence="16">638 THE MONIST God, are used in a constative way (which is perfectly true), and this is all right. Kant says that this practice is not all right. Again, it would seem as though we have an important dis agreement between Kant and Austin. Once again, I am not con vinced that this is the case. Take any proposition 'P* that has important uses in the human vocabulary, but which is not in any way verifiable. If 'P* is in his catalogue of regulative propositions. Kant says that 'P* is merely regulative. Austin says, no, it is used as a constative. But both philosophers agree that 'P* is unverifiable, and that it lacks reference. Both philosophers, indeed, agree that *P' is ordinarily used as a constative. If both philosophers agree that 'P* is unverifiable, and if, fur thermore, both philosophers agree that 'P* has important non referential uses, have we not then reduced this apparent conflict to a merely verbal dispute? Kant says: "Regulative!" Austin says: "Constative!" I do not mean to belittle the work of Austin. He, after all, provides a much more minute analysis of language than Kant. Austin notices many things about language that Kant did not. What I am suggesting is that in (say) the analysis of moral language it is neither the case that Kant and Austin were saying exactly the same thing, nor is it the case that their disagreements were impor tant ones. Finally, it is interesting to ask what it was that Kant thought of himself as doing. Austin, as everyone knows, saw himself as giving "as full, clear, and accurate account as possible of the ex pression (words, idioms, sentences, grammatical forms) of some language, or variety of language,"28 in the hope of solving or at least resolving certain (not necessarily all) traditional philosoph ical problems. Austin, for his part, thought that he had developed a technique for tackling certain problems that particularly interested him, problems about the nature of language. He did not imagine that he had first formulated the problems and he did not imagine that he had dis covered the only method of tackling them.29 28 J. O. Urmson, "J. L. Austin," The Journal of Philosophy (October, 1965), p. 500. 29/&amp;idvp.499.</page><page sequence="17">KANT'S CONSTITUTIVE-REGULATIVE DISTINCTION 639 It goes without saying that Austin did not see himself as some sort of quasi-scientist or super-scientist, discovering truths about the nature of things. This view of the philosopher's task is no longer de rigueur amongst Anglo-American philosophers. It is my view that in this area, as in* others mentioned above, Kant was not so far removed from twentieth-century insights as has ordinarily been imagined. What Kant says, in the context of talking about the constitutive-regulative distinction, is this: "We are not here asking questions in regard to the nature of things, but only such questions as arise from the very nature of reason . . ." (A695 B723) This disclaimer is, of course, ambiguous. Some would say that Kant saw himself as "discussing parts of the occult life-story of persons."30 This view of Kant is at least open to question. Kant, after all, denies that one can say anything constitutive about such "occult" entities as mind. My own view is that Kant, though he did not always express himself in a felicitous fashion, saw himself as making observa tions about the ways in which we think, and the ways in which we express ourselves. What he was trying to do was not altogether different from what Austin and others like him have been trying to do in the twentieth century. Whether or not I am correct in thinking this, I think it extremely important to notice how germane is Kant's constitutive-regulative distinction to so much that is of value in twentieth-century philosophy.
