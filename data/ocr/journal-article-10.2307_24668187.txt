<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASPECTS OF THE EXCAVATIONS AT ACANTHUS: THE EARLY IRON AGE AND THE EARLY ARCHAIC PERIOD* Eleni Trakosopoulou-Salakidou The polis of Acanthus was built on the conspicuous hill range by the safe-water gulf that bears the same name.1 The site is flanked on one side by the Strymonic Gulf, and on the other by the Singitic. Acanthus controlled the entrance to Acte,2 the easternmost peninsula of the Chalcidice, and was endowed with rare natural resources: the famous mineral deposits and forests of the wider area of modern-day Ierissos.3 Owing to its position as a major harbour of the northern Aegean, Acanthus became a point of attraction for competing colonists. In approximately the mid-7th century bc the inhabitants of Andros succeeded in colonizing the site, according to Thucydides (IV 84: 1). Plutarch (■Quaest. Graec. 30) identified the colonists as Andrians and Euboean Chalcidians.4 The ancient settlement is situated by the south-eastern limit of modern-day Ierissos; the cemeteries extend along the north-east coastal zone of the modern town, the graves of the colonists being parallel to the sea shore.5 The most ancient graves, those of the native population, are situated in the neighbouring inland area (fig. 1; col. pl. Ill: l).6 Archaeological excavations, exclusively salvage in nature, have been conducted at Acanthus for over thirty years. This work has concentrated on the cemetery of the colonists that lies within modern building plots currently subject to a non-development order.7 Systematic excavations of the ancient city have not been undertaken, with the result that its early period of settlement and subsequent development are unknown, as is its town plan. A limited number of building remains are, however, known. These have either been visible through the centuries—indicators of the continuous occupation of the site up to our own period—or they have been revealed as part of a small-scale preliminary research programme that aimed at the elucidation of specific monuments.8 I warmly thank my friend and colleague M. Tiverios, Professor of Classical Archaeology at the Aristoteleion University of Thessalonike, for reading this paper and for his comments on the finds from Acanthus and their dating. I should also like to thank Dr S. Paspalas for translating and editing my paper.

Important evidence for this task is offered by the fragment of a marble anthropomorphic stele (1.160.1033) of the menhir type, that was found in secondary use in an Archaic tomb precinct wall of the seaside cemetery (pl. 1: l).9 This discovery is to be set alongside related finds from neighbouring regions, such as those from Skala Soteros on Thasos, Therme (Thessalonike), and especially Souphli Magoula (Larissa); the stele from the latter site may be considered its closest parallel within Greece.10 The find from Acanthus increases the number of known anthropomorphic stelai from Greece and the wider Mediterranean. These stelai are localized to south-eastern Europe and belong to the Aegean Anatolian group. The distribution of examples of this group has been linked to the movement of Indo-Europeans towards the end of the Chalcolithic period, though this view has not been conclusively established. Only the upper—now headless—part of the menhir from Acanthus is preserved. Originally, it may have been meant to represent a female as it bears a heavy four-chain necklace at the neck. By the left breast there is preserved the tip of the right hand. A more precise iconographie analysis is not easily undertaken on the basis of the preserved features, nor can the piece be dated precisely since study of these anthropomorphic stelai has shown that they lack clear typological features that could define any developmental stages from the Bronze into the Iron Age. The earliest archaeologically attested phase of occupation at Acanthus dates to the Early Iron Age. A small number of settlement remains indicate that a nucleus of activity of this period was located at Kastro, the northern hill of the archaeological site. This hill is a naturally defensible site situated by the sea. It is not impossible that it was walled, as it appears—on the basis of some slight evidence—were other comparable sites in the Chalcidice, as well as in central and eastern Macedonia.11 These building remains of two stone-built structures extend to the lower slopes of the southern and western sides of Kastro. The first is that of a building, either oval or apsidal in plan, part of which is preserved below the southern aisle of the Byzantine church of the Birth of the Theotokos. The second, on the slope named Ladiava, is probably later in date. It is rectangular in plan and includes a pithos storage area and an adjoining room with a beaten clay floor and a hearth.12 The meagre impression of Acanthus' cultural affinities in the Early Iron Age can be supplemented thanks to the few finds from the settlement as well as the grave-goods from the corresponding pre-colonial cemetery which is mainly comprised of pithos inhumations, often, below stone heaps, within periboloi (pl. 1: 2).13 The local pottery, both handmade and wheelmade, adhered to a long-established tradition. It made use of artistic elements and forms that were established as far back as the Early Bronze Age. Within the corpus of handmade 9 Ε.

These categories are not frequently found in the Chalcidice. The first category, which is known in the Chalcidice mainly from the finds made at Aghios Mamas, is represented at Acanthus by only one fragment (I.Ak.l 1550, pl. 1: 3) which was found during a small-scale excavation in the ancient city. It bears grooved, linear, and impressed ornamentation around a low knob.14 This decoration may point to cultural contacts, more than likely indirect, with central Europe.15 Representative examples of the incised category are, amongst others, a krater-like cooking vessel (I.KTN.201), the lip of which is underlined by carelessly executed slanting lines (pi. 2:1), and a cup (Ι.Ξ.12.17, pi. 2: 2) with a series of stippled triangles in its shoulder zone, a motif that was widespread in central and eastern Macedonia, but not in the Chalcidice.16 The handmade category includes, among other pieces, a kantharos belonging to an interesting type with discoid knobs on the handles. Probably created in Macedonia during the Neolithic period,17 the type appears, on current knowledge, in the Chalcidice most commonly ι ο on Sithonia and particularly at Olynthus, Aï-Yianni Nikites, Koukos Sykias, and Torone. The example from Acanthus (1.1.5a.8, pi. 3: 1), which was deposited as a grave-good, is a variant of the one-handled type.19 Its closest parallel are two grave-finds, one from Koukos Sykias20 and another from Torone.21 The jewellery of the first occupants of Acanthus excavated at the site is also noteworthy. These pieces contribute to our knowledge of locally produced artefacts, as well as of the technological and artistic achievements of the period. The typology of the fibulae adds a new aspect to our understanding of the cultural connections between the inhabitants of Acanthus and the rest of the Greek and Aegean region. Furthermore, links with a central European cultural tradition are established by the spiral bronze bracelets. Among the various common types of jewellery were also found some relatively rare types such as the gold spiral ornaments, probably earrings (pi. 3: 2). This type is known from Lefkandi, Vergina, and Thasos, as well as from European sites.22 European origins are also identifiable in another Early Iron Age find from Acanthus: the double-sided iron sword Ι.Ξ. 12.31. This find is an example of the Naue II sword type which was widely distributed in the northern Greek region, and common in the wider Greek area during the Geometric period.23 The appearance, though in limited numbers, of wheelmade pottery in this period is equally of interest.24 It is characterized by vessels, mainly large in size, with painted Sub 14 Trakosopoulou 2004, 267. 15 Β.

All the examples of this category were found in the cemetery, though similar finds were also excavated in the area of the ancient city. Among the recent finds there is one that is rare at Acanthus: a locally made amphora (1.0.91, pi. 3: 3) that belongs to a much discussed category of Sub-protogeometric painted amphorae decorated with concentric circles or semicircles and bands. This category is known primarily from the wider northern Aegean area. These amphorae share certain features, both morphological and decorative: an oval body with a slight ring base, a cylindrical neck with a raised ridge at its base, a square projecting rim, vertical band handles, and a shoulder decorative scheme consisting of at least three concentric circles or semicircles between groups of horizontal bands in which the central one is thickest. This amphora type equates with Catling's Type II, and is found at various sites in the eastern Aegean, such as Troy and Clazomenae,25 as well as in central and northern—and indeed southern—Greece.26 The type can be dated at least as far back as the 10th century bc.27 During the long period—well into the Early Archaic period—in which it was produced, the basic type underwent some interesting changes in shape and decoration, which probably reflect the products of different workshops. In very recent years, thanks to the excavations at Clazomenae, new shapes, such as the hydria and the oinochoe, can be attributed to the group, and so it now appears that some workshops did not produce amphorae alone.28 A large number of these vessels have recently been found in current excavations in central Macedonia, mainly those in the innermost part of the Thermaic Gulf, such as Anchialos and Karabournaki (Thessalonike). Therefore, the suggestion made by R. W. V. Catling and M. Tiverios that these amphorae were produced in this area is most convincing.29 As the example from Acanthus was not found with any other objects, it cannot be dated precisely, but, on the grounds of its shape and decorative scheme, it should belong to the 8th century. An amphora with vertical handles on its shoulder (1.118.1, pi. 2: 3) is a recent find and, to date, a unique example of local pottery production.30 The care with which it was made should be noted. So, too, should its painted decoration consisting of horizontal zones which, on the obverse, are filled with a series of cross-hatched rhomboids, while on the reverse the shoulder zone is filled exclusively by a series of St. Andrew's crosses. Both the shape and the decorative scheme are known in the Geometric period, mainly on the islands, but also in northern Greece.31 The amphora is dated, with some reservations, to the second quarter of the 25 Troy: R.

A clear example of this is a unique local vessel, the burial amphora 1.161.152 (pi. 4: 1). It is characterized by a low, wide, cylindrical neck, an oval body, with a practically spherical upper part, and vertical double handles, circular in section, on its shoulder. Its overall form and various characteristics, such as its handles or its points of articulation, as well as its decoration, associate it with Cycladic ceramics,34 and particularly with the Linear Island Style.35 It is not impossible that it was made by colonist craftsmen or by itinerant islander potters.36 The rich decorative scheme of this amphora, rendered in a brown-red paint, consists of various elements from the Geometric repertoire into which motifs derived from Aeolic and Island workshops have been successfully integrated. These features testify to a common stylistic koine in painted pottery that is characteristic of the period. On the Acanthus amphora these stylistic elements are combined in a uniquely idiosyncratic manner, clearly due to the painter's individual inspiration. The scheme in the main field on the obverse is framed by alternating horizontal and vertical zones. The field itself is occupied by two deer, well drawn in silhouette. These are characterized by almond-shaped eyes, tall legs, and a short tail. The animals, facing right, are placed within a landscape.37 Both the style and the details of the painting, e.g. the full use of linear and floral filling ornaments indicating a sense of horror vacui, as well as the positioning and rendering of the deer, are reminiscent of mid-7th-century bc Orientalizing works. It may be noted that deer rendered in a generally similar fashion are seen on contemporary relief pithoi, and some of their morphological features are also evident on Protoattic vessels that betray Cycladic influence (pi. 4: 2).38 The mid-7th-century date of the amphora can serve as a terminus post quem for the two small locally-made vessels found with it in grave 5410: a plain one-handled cup 32 Walter op. cit. and Boardman op. cit. 33 According to Eusebius, Acanthus was colonized in 665/654 bc: Euseb.

An exact parallel for this amphora has not as yet been found among the known products of eastern Aegean, Island, or Chalcidic workshops. Generally similar amphorae have been excavated at Mende, such as that found in an Archaic destruction deposit in House Ζ of the 'Proasteion', as well as a funerary amphora (A130 ΜΘ 12724 [T. 162]).40 The main difference in form between these two pieces and the one excavated at Acanthus is that the Mendean amphorae have a narrower and taller neck, but differences can also be seen in the layout of their decorative schemes; the handle areas of the Mendean amphorae share the same decorative treatment. The Acanthian amphora, furthermore, bears some formal similarity with a Cycladic amphora, now in the Archaeological Museum of Kavala (A 1892), that was excavated in the cemetery of ancient Oesyme and which dates to 630-620 bc.41 The Cycladic amphora, however, has a more slender body, tapers more sharply towards the base, and has a narrower and taller neck. A recent find, the oinochoe with cut-away mouth 1.118.2, which should probably be dated to the last quarter of the 7th century, is also to be identified as locally made (pi. 5: l).42 Its form, and particularly its rim with the cut-away section by the handle, as well as its painted banded decoration on a bright yellowish slip applied on the grey-coloured clay, reflect influences from the Aegean region, possibly the eastern or Ionian areas, as seen on jugs of the Euboean tradition.43 The pieces excavated at Acanthus that belong to the group known as 'pre-Persian' at Olynthus can be seen as local,44 and the same holds true for the so-called 'silvery ware'. The latter ware has only been found in limited numbers in the Chaldcidice when compared to the finds made in the regions along the inner Thermaic Gulf, and especially at Anchialos.45 The presence of such a large amount of 'silvery ware' in the latter region indicates that it 39 See Kaltsas op. cit.

At Acanthus 'silvery ware' is represented by two funerary amphorae, as well as a few sherds from the area of the ancient city.46 The amphorae, 1.51.442 (pi. 5: 2), found in 1985, and 1.138.25 (col. pl. Ill: 2), a very recent find, are characterized by their oval body, relatively thin walls, a nearly cylindrical neck which flares slightly as it approaches the outward projecting rim, and double-reeded shoulder handles. The two amphorae differ as regards the relief band at the bottom of the neck. On the former it in effect comprises a specific morphological feature, while on the latter it is far less obvious and positioned at a lower level. Both amphorae bear a slip, which has mostly worn away, and painted decoration with shared elements. In the main zone, that of the shoulder, there is a series of concentric circles—a particularly popular element in a long-lasting tradition47—which is framed by parallel horizontal bands. There is some variation between the two amphorae as regards the secondary motifs between the bands. On 1.51.442 wavy horizontal lines are placed in this position, while on 1.138.25 an (at least hitherto) rarer motif appears in two of the zones: groups of parallel, obliquely placed lines of dashes.48 The first, partly preserved, amphora of this numerically small category is an isolated find. The second, which is the closest parallel to the first, contained a number of sherds which provide some indication as to its date. Specifically, two Early Corinthian aryballos sherds (Ι.138.97α-β) are of a known type of the late 7th century which continued into the 6th (col. pl. Ill: 3).49 On the basis of this evidence it is likely that the two amphorae should be dated to the second half of the 7th century or towards its end.50 The 7th-century imported pottery at Acanthus indicates a broadening of its contacts with the wider world. Imported products of eastern and Island workshops date to the early 7th century, and link the establishment of these contacts with the first settlement of colonists at the site. A unique find of the most recent excavations is a shoulder-handled amphora (1.138.202, pi. 6), an impressive example of the Cycladic Linear Island style.51 Its nearly cylindrical neck with a distinct raised band below the rim, the sharp articulation at the neck/shoulder join, its high foot, as well as its rather spherical body, are all morphological features which associate it with the earliest orientalizing amphorae and with the early Linear Island amphorae. Furthermore, these features may indicate, though with some reservations, that it should be classified as a product of Lembese's Workshop B, in which case it is among the earliest pieces of the series. By contrast, however, its obliquely placed handles and its characteristic pedestal foot link it with Early Archaic examples.52 The decorative scheme of the amphora, clearly influenced by the traditions of the Late Geometric period, strictly adheres to a symmetrical arrangement in the zones on both sides of the vessel. This holds both for their general layout, and also for their internal divisions. It is also characteristic of this vessel that similar motifs frame the central field on both sides. No distinction as to primacy is made between the two sides. The same conception is expressed by the vertical squiggly lines on the neck as well as in the horizontal zones above and below the main fields.

Definitely Archaic elements are to be noted in the decoration of the shoulder. The main fields carry on one side a feline and on the other a bird. They are rendered in outline, while dots or lines are used to indicate further details. Dots have been used for the body and hind legs of the feline, parallel lines for its forelegs and for the bird on the other side of the vessel. The Geometric motif of the concentric circle, framed by dotted diamonds, occupies each flanking field. Both morphological and stylistic details of the amphora date it to the second quarter of the 7th century bc.53 The location of the workshop that produced such vessels is a much discussed topic. The leading contenders have been Thera, Paros, and Naxos. Recently the matter has been raised again by M. Tiverios' suggestion that Dorian Thera is the strongest candidate as the production centre of this pottery category which, however, had Naxian origins.54 The importance, beyond its artistic value, of the new find from Acanthus resides in the fact that examples of the Island style are extremely rare, if not totally absent, in the northern Aegean, despite the links of the inhabitants of the Cyclades with this region, and indeed their colonial activity there. The absence of examples of this group from the Parian colony of Thasos is noteworthy. Nonetheless, it should be noted that a Linear Island amphora sherd from Sane on Pallene (Chalcidice) exists in the collection of the Cast Museum of the Aristotelian University of Thessalonike.55 A small amphoriskos (1.01.69, pi. 5: 3) of the middle of the 7th century, deposited as a grave-good, links Acanthus with the north-eastern Aegean and the pottery of Lemnos. It is decorated with the popular zig-zag motif. Similar vessels have been found in the Protolemnian cemetery at Hephaestea.56 The pottery output of Archaic Chios at Acanthus is mainly represented by transport amphorae. The type of amphora with the characteristic painted bands on its body and handles and the S-motif on its shoulder is representative of the third quarter of the 7th century. Examples of the type, such as 1.118.10 (pi. 5: 4), are present in the Acanthus cemetery where they were used as containers for infant burials.57 Similar vessels have been excavated at neighbouring Thasos58 and Mende.59 Fragments of Chian amphorae have also been excavated in the area of the Thermaic Gulf.60 It is not possible, within the limits of the present paper, to present all the categories of pottery imported to Acanthus during the Archaic period from East Greece and the Islands. Indicatively, it is simply noted here that pieces of other known categories, such as Wild Goat, are not lacking, though they occur rather sporadically.61 53 See, for example, the shape of the amphorae, ibid. 183^1 nos. A 35-8 pis. 14-15. Lions are rendered in a similar manner, with dotted bodies and forelegs decorated by lines on an oinochoe from Aegina (London BM 75.8-20.35; ibid. 185—6 [K 1] pi. 17: c-f and fig. 33: e [690-660 bc]), as well as on a fragment from the Samian Heraion now in Berlin (ibid. 188 fig. 17 pi. 20: h [690-660 bc]). 54 Tiverios art. cit.
