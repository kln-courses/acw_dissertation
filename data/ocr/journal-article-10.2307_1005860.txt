Jean Rostand The hundred years during which Bernard de Fonte- nelle lived (1657-1757) witnessed the first grand syn- thesis of modern science and the creation of a social science in its image. Fontenelle's contribution to these two developments has traditionally been recognized by describing him as a popularizer of Cartesian science and the progenitor of the philosophes. In fact he did design his Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes and Digression sur les anciens et les modernes as propa- ganda for scientific ideas. However, these were the works of his younger years; later his forty-four years as secretary of the Academie des Sciences occasioned the more serious Histoire de l'Academie which, together with his Eloges and numerous fragments, show him to have been more than a mere popularizer of other people's ideas. Critics in our century have viewed him as a philosopher and spokesman for science, the first to have enunciated the doctrine of the unity of sci- ence and to have formulated a complete theory of prog- ress. Two contemporary philosophers, J. R. Carre and F. Gregoire, have written detailed and extremely useful analyses of his thought, both of which testify to the importance of his work, although they do not agree on its substance. The chief problem in Fontenelle criticism is his al- leged Cartesianism. Some writers have considered his life-long support of Cartesian physics sufficient justifi- cation for the Cartesian label. Most commentators, however, have identified him as such for his supposed rationalism, and Carre is in that tradition. Gregoire, on the other hand, has correctly noted Fontenelle's rad- ical departure from Descartes in metaphysics and method and his adherence to a critical empiricism in science, but seems to attach little importance to this fact. The confusion that exists with respect to "Car- tesianism" requires us to define the term and to question its meaning in the Age of Enlightenment. G. J. Beyer in an article in the Romanic Review (February, 1943) has distinguished the various elements in Descartes's work and described the abandonment by most of his followers of all those points which were essential to his philosophy. If such were the case, then what the eighteenth, century retained of Descartes's legacy we can hardly call by his name. Aram Vartanian, in his stim- ulating book Diderot and Descartes, declares otherwise, arguing that the scientific naturalism of the Enlighten- ment, which Fontenelle upheld, derives by way of transmutation from Descartes himself. One of my purposes in this monograph is to re-examine the validity of such a conclusion through the medium of Fonte- nelle's thought and its significance in his time. However, in carrying out such a task we should not look for a systematic philosophy in Fontenelle as Carre and Gregoire have done, for the esprit de syste'me was the very thing he opposed. Gregoire may be correct in noting a logical contradiction between Fontenelle's faith in science and his disenchantment with the idea of progress, but logical contradiction does not preclude consistency. Although Fontenelle was skeptical of moral progress, he had no doubt that the method of science could effect improvement in man's mind as well as in his mode of living. Gregoire has defined Fon- tenelle's scientific methodology without perceiving that it was method that linked his science and social science and that lay at the heart of both, offering man his only means of escape from ignorance. Whatever disen- chantment Fontenelle experienced was with man him- self and not with science. Thus as critic of the scien- tific revolution he combined new thoughts with old values, linking modern science with the rich tradition of humanism from which he believed it had sprung; as moraliste Fontenelle was to a large degree responsible for creating a climate of opinion which assisted scien- tific discovery in France. These two facts require the intellectual historian to adopt a broader basis for analy- sis than is normally used by the historian of philosophy. Until now there has been no work in English that has examined the whole of Fontenelle's thought, and none that has examined it from the point of view of the historian. To answer these needs I have thought best to arrange my materials in topical rather than chrono- logical order. Thus, in chapter three I consider the Theorie des tourbillons, which he wrote at the end of his career, but which is a restatement of the Cartesian position in science. After a brief description of Fon- tenelle's reputation, I treat of his character, and then his beliefs in science. Chapters four through six de- scribe his philosophy of science. The remaining por- tion of the book is given over to a discussion of his social science, which was a natural outgrowth of Fon- tenelle's hope that science would liberate mankind from ignorance and error.

FONTENELLE'S REPUTATION Bernard de Fontenelle was one of the best-known men in eighteenth-century France, an astonishing fact about an academician who was extremely retiring in his habits. The chief events of his life are few. Born in Rouen on February 11, 1657, he received a good education from the Jesuits, but acquired a detestation of logic which never left him. This may explain why he abandoned his plan for a legal career and shortly afterwards went to Paris to seek literary fame. Fon- tenelle was related on his mother's side to the great Corneille, and might have persisted in trying to emulate his uncle had he not had the good sense to recognize his own limitations. He returned to Rouen in 1680 to stay for seven years, by which time his reputation was made by his Dialogues des morts, Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes, and Histoire des oracles, to be followed in 1688 by his Digression sur les anciens et les modernes which catapulted him into the current controversy on that subject. Doubtless it was his sympathy for the moderns which barred him on four occasions from the Academie franqaise; on the fifth in 1691 he was finally received, but with a notable coolness. His appointment as secretary to the Academie des Sciences in 1697 was more auspicious, for it was from that date until 1740, when he asked to be retired, that Fontenelle fulfilled himself as critic of science and spokesman for it to the educated public of his time. He died peacefully on January 8, 1757, one month short of one hundred years, socially active to the last. The Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes made Fontenelle's reputation as a popularizer of science, but the famous Eloges of his later years were no less avidly read, if less prettily written. The somewhat austere Histoire de l'Acade&amp;nie des Sciences had as many readers among the general public as among the learned and indeed was designed with that end in view. In clear, concise language Fontenelle explained the new men of science and their subjects to the fashionable world, the court and the bourgeoisie who were by then accustomed to doing without the preciosite that had marked the Entretiens. It was to Fontenelle's credit that he could keep pace with the times. PAGE VI. The meaning of science ........................ 40 VII. The social sciences ............................. 46 VIII.

He was thought then as later to be a good writer, but on grounds of stylistic excellence and not of originality of thought. Thus Monsieur Seguier who succeeded Fontenelle at the Academie fran~aise asked: But what eulogy should we tender to Fontenelle for those so estimable eloges in which he not only succeeded in overcoming the human prejudice against funeral orations but made an art out of praising a particular person and a new kind of talent? I seem to hear them all at this moment, all those famous dead urging me to honor their debt. Endowed with different merits and unequal reputa- tions, almost all of them were elevated to the same degree of celebrity by the eloquence and insight of the eulogist, an orator who knew somewhat better how to praise them than to emulate or judge them.1 It is clear from this passage that Fontenelle had at least one dubious admirer. There were a few others who thought that the secretary wrote philosophy like a fop. Voltaire, in his brilliant satire Micromegas, could not resist poking fun at his unacknowledged mentor and a gentlemanly feud ensued, with Fon- tenelle refusing to take umbrage and Voltaire denying that he felt anything but respect for the learned academician. Indeed Voltaire contributed to the flood of eulogies that were written and delivered on the occasion of Fontenelle's death, describing him as the first of the popularizers, thereby tacitly acknowledging his debt to his predecessor.2 Although to some people the task of popularization seemed unimportant, others recognized the signal service that Fontenelle performed for the "New Philosophy." However important it might be for the public to be educated, it was of greater moment that science be ac- 1Discours prononce par M.

The very enthusiasm that the public manifested for science speaks for the success that Fontenelle enjoyed in ex- plaining science to his readers. His efforts in that direction were greeted by a large number of friendly responses. Replying to the discourse of M. Seguier, quoted above, M. le duc de Nivernois declared: "It was reserved to Fontenelle to generalize the work of Bacon and Descartes, to familiarize the entire public with philosophy, to make reason a common thing, to in- troduce and establish it in all genres and in all minds." 3 To make the spirit of Bacon and Descartes available to all was no mean achievement, but M. le duc implied that the scientists benefited as well from Fontenelle's activity. In another part of the discourse he credited the secretary with teaching the "savants to be mistaken, philosophers to doubt, and physicists to observe." 4 The chorus of praise mounted in the year of Fon- tenelle's death culminating in the Abbe Trublet's panegyric Memoires pour servir a I'histoire de la vie et des ouvrages de M. de Fontenelle. Trublet perhaps gave Fontenelle too much credit for the success of science, but there was no denying that by 1757, "the taste for sci- ence being more widespread, the savants were more es- teemed, more highly considered, more sought after." 5 Most observers are agreed that the Eloges of Fontenelle were largely responsible for raising the scientists in the estimation of society. Moreover, there were others in Fontenelle's time to second the Abbe's ,exalted opinion of him. Grimm, in his Correspondance lit- teraire, thought that, M. de Fontenelle is one of those rare men who not only witnessed all the revolutions in the human mind throughout a century but also produced a few of his own and laid the foundations for several others. His works have be- come classics. . . . The esprit philosophique, so wide- spread today, owes its beginnings to Fontenelle.6 In addition, the authors of the Grande encyclopedie were conscious of their debt to their fellow propagandist for science. In the "Discours preliminaire," d'Alem- bert wrote enthusiastically of Fontenelle whose con- tribution to the spirit of the age he thought was on a par with those of Bacon, Descartes, Newton, and Locke. As for Fontenelle's popularization of science, its ex- cellence and importance has never gone unrecognized since the academy was renewed in 1699 and Fontenelle appointed its secretary with the purpose of publicizing its activity.7 His success need not be measured by critical praise alone. Fontenelle's work went through 3 Extrait de la reponse de M. le Duc de Nivernois au dis- cours de M. Seguiier, (Euvres 1: 81. 4 Ibid., 81. 5 Trublet, 62. 6 Grimm, Correspondance litteraire, 1 fevrier, 1757, 2: 88, Paris, 1829. 7 See Mairan, Eloge de Fontenelle 1: 11. six editions in his lifetime, and six more by 1825.8 The Plurality of Worlds appeared in English translation within a year of its publication in France,9 and it served as a model to the Italian Francesco Algarotti, who wrote a popularization of Newtonianism for the ladies. Finally, Fontenelle set a standard by which all future secretaries of the Academy would be judged. In a letter to him in 1754, the secretary of the Academie des Sciences at Rouen declared, "Monsieur, you are the dean, the father and model of all secretaries of academies of science," 10 and in 1846, Pierre Flourens, then secretary of the Academy, considered that none among Fontenelle's successors had the precision and perfection that he alone seemed to have attained in his Eloges.1 After the revolution of 1789 Fontenelle's reputation acquired added luster. His interpretation of science was credited with having helped to create a new world view that could be termed a philosophy. La Harpe, writing in 1797, placed Fontenelle in the first rank of philosophers, judging that in his Histoire of the Acad- emy and in the Eloges, Fontenelle had provided the keynote of the enlightenment.12 Men of the stature of Cuvier and Lalande considered those same works to have been responsible for the flowering of French sci- ence in the eighteenth century.13 By mid-century Flourens stated for the learned world that the first sec- retary of the Academy was entitled to be ranked as a historian and philosopher of science, a worthy con- tinuator of Rene Descartes, and the foremost spokes- man for the eighteenth-century method of science. No attempt was made by the great nineteenth-cen- tury literary critics to define Fontenelle's philosophy of science. They attacked him for his alleged lack of 8 Although the 1790 edition, considered by many to be the best, has been used in the preparation of this monograph, the author has checked his quotations on occasion with the editions of 1767 and 1818. 9 Translated by Sir William Damville, Dublin, 1687, and another edition by Glanvill in 1688.

The Academy has had a series of distinguished secretaries, Condorcet, Flourens, J. L. F. Bertrand, de Broglie, to name a few, who seem to have been conscious of the prece- dent that Fontenelle set by his Aloges. His successors have striven with success to maintain a high level of style and con- tent in their own eulogies, so that the entire series of them serves as a valuable reader in French science. 12 La Harpe, J.

And Lalande, in a preface to a new edition (1828) of the Pluralite des mondes, said, "Peu de personnes ont contribue plus que lui au progres des sciences en les mettant 'a la portee de tout le monde et en inspirant le gofit de l'etude par la lecture de ses eloges." 6 [TRANS.

Perhaps as a result of their own unstated assumptions, the myth was created by Sainte-Beuve and Brunetiere, Faguet and Lanson that the science for which Fontenelle was spokesman followed in the rationalist tradition of the much-loved Descartes. Sainte-Beuve divided the per- sonality of the academician into "bel esprit" and "grand esprit," 14 the former title awarded for his early pre- ciosite which Sainte-Beuve discounted,15 the latter for his championing of enlightenment. Much less sym- pathetic to Fontenelle was Faguet who accused the sec- retary of superficiality, stating that the Eloges, "ne generalisent rien." That Faguet was unfamiliar with the scientific achievement of the eighteenth century, not to mention Fontenelle's own considerable contribu- tion to it, is made clear by his article. Although both Faguet and Lanson challenge the notion that Fontenelle too readily accepted the Cartesian cosmology and intro- duce us to a new picture of him as a skeptic and genial unbeliever,16 the impression is offered that his geniality may have extended to science itself, so that we are finally left with little more of Fontenelle than La Bru- yere's original characterization of him as "bel esprit." In this century, however, there has been an increas- ing awareness on the part of French critics and philoso- phers of the unique contribution that Fontenelle made to French science.17 His claim to fame as a popularizer of Cartesian science goes unchallenged, but an effort has been made to determine what variations Fontenelle played on that theme and what the character was of his own contribution as a philosopher of science. Thus Levy-Bruhl and then Laborde-Millaa credited him with having enunciated the idea of an order in nature that permitted him to speak of the unity of science, a unity characterized by the mathematical relationship obtain- ing among physical phenomena. Fontenelle's activity as a popularizer is described as going beyond the bounds of science to make knowledge in general the basis for his idea of progress.18 Within five years of the appearance of Laborde-Millaa's book, France was offered another by Louis Maigron, an essay by Doumic, that was inspired by those two volumes, another essay by Lanson that described Fontenelle as the first of the philosophes, and finally in 1910 a popular account of 14 See C. A. Sainte-Beuve, Causeries du lundi, 2nd ed., 3: Paris, 1852. 15 It is La Bruyere who is generally acknowledged to be re- sponsible for the accusation of "prediosite" in his portrait of Fontenelle as Cydias in Les Caracteres. 16 Faguet, E., Dix-huitieme siecle, etudes litteraires, 12 ed., Paris, 1894. 17 Levy-Bruhl, L., History of modern philosophy in France, Chicago, 1890. Although he makes much of Fontenelle's Car- tesianism, Levy-Bruhl is the first in modern times to write a clear appreciation of Fontenelle's contribution to science. 18 Laborde-Millaa, Fontenelle, Paris, 1905. Fontenelle by Andre Chaumeix.19 Nothing further was published on Fontenelle until 1932 when the first of two major works on his thought, the book by J. R. Carre appeared. Carre's book is exhaustive and of heroic proportion. He professes to see Fontenelle as a philosopher who in formulating his ideas about man, society, nature and God remained faithful to the idea of reason that he formed in his early years.20 The book has made a sig- nificant contribution to the study of Fontenelle by re- lating the ideas to the man, thereby providing a per- sonality against which the philosophy stands out in sharper relief. Furthermore, it does succeed in es- tablishing the profundity of Fontenelle's work, but the significance of his philosophy is misinterpreted by rea- son of the author's method of analysis. As an exercise in explication des textes, Carre's book is excellent, but it fails to provide the historical background against which Fontenelle's thought can be understood and measured. Moreover, because he sees no difference between the critical rationalism that marked Fonte- nelle's social science and the critical empiricism which he supported in natural science, Carre does not depart from the traditional portrait of Fontenelle as a Car- tesian. The second major work on Fontenelle, by F. Gregoire, is more successful in outlining the scientific currents within which Fontenelle's ideas developed, and in defining his method.21 However, the author overlooks the importance of method for Fontenelle's philosophy and thereby views his social science as standing apart from his other ideas. Gregoire's theme is the basic contradiction between Fontenelle's faith in science and his "disenchantment" with the idea of progress. Perhaps it is because of his reluctance to deal with the question of methodology or because of the self-imposed necessity for defining Fontenelle as an eighteenth-century philosophe that Gregoire mis- understands his pessimism. Both of these very useful volumes have done much to raise the stature of Fontenelle as a philosopher, but both are hampered by the methods of philosophy. They approach the spokesman for science with the tool of analysis, without properly assessing his role and significance in the scientific milieu of his time. A man as unsystematic as Fontenelle ought not to be examined in the same manner as the great system builders. Not the consistency of his words, but his. faithfulness to an idea and its gradual formulation within the context of his environment ought to be the 19 Maigron, L., Fontenelle: I'homme, l'oruvre, I'influence, Paris, 1906. This book is a superficial study of Fontenelle, leaning heavily on the tradition of literary criticism that de- picts the academician as a popularizer and bel esprit. 20 Carre, J.

The historian must not content himself with the study of Fontenelle's avowed ideas alone; rather he must look to the whole fabric of implicit ideas which composed the climate of opinion from which Fontenelle drew and which, in turn, he helped to direct into new channels. In so doing the historian will add still another dimen- sion to the man whose reputation has never ceased to grow in the hands of literary critics, scientists, philo- sophes and philosophers. II. THE HUMAN CONDITION I In 1690 Fontenelle published a short essay entitled Du Bonheur, a subject with which he was preoccupied his entire life. Indeed, his life itself was a testimonial to the fact that man can so order his existence as to avoid all cause of annoyance. Perhaps his early ill health explains this kind of behavior which is so foreign to full-blooded persons who are rather more dedicated to life and who, paradoxically, often die young. Al- though Fontenelle's behavior suggests egoism, certainly his generosity, consideration, and kindliness argue against selfishness. He was exceptional for his time in lacking the ambition to be a courtier, perhaps unusual in any time in his desire for independence. Conversa- tion and the table provided him with his chief pleasures; but his happiness consisted of that state of calm which was the ideal of ancient philosophy: stoic, epicurean, and skeptic. His formula for successful living was nothing less than contentment: "Le plus grand secret pour le bonheur c'est d'etre bien avec soi." 1 If this statement leaves a multitude of things unsaid, it has the virtue of leaving the path open to the seeker. Quite naturally for a person who liked his calm, Fontenelle avoided marriage. (The Abbe Trublet thought that it was this choice that enabled Fontenelle to live so long.) However, his desire for independence did not require isolation, and Fontenelle was credited with being a gallant in life as well as in letters. Upon being introduced, in his nineties, to an attractive young woman, he is said to have exclaimed, "Ah, to be eighty again !" With such spirit he obviously intrigued some of the ladies who knew him as their testimony shows. Madame de Tencin, whose salon he frequented, re- proached him with having a brain in place of his heart, and Madame Geoffrin, who was one of his closest friends, declared that he sometimes smiled, but never laughed or cried. Yet certainly Fontenelle was not unaware of the existence of the passions, which in his Dialogues des morts of 1683, he described as pre- eminent among the determinants of human conduct. Although Fontenelle was committed to a life of the mind, he was convinced of the importance of the ir- rational. 'Fontenelle, Du Bonheur, ?Euvres 5: 348. The Dialogues des morts were consciously patterned after Lucian and like Lucian Fontenelle showed a mastery of paradox and epigram. On that account they have often been charged with being superficial by our world which has abandoned the epigram as an art form; in the seventeenth century, they achieved popularity almost upon date of publication, and were accorded a warm critical response.2 A second charge of superficiality has been leveled against their sub- stance, as being little more than a succession of maxims, with small claim to profundity. But we must remem- ber this was the age that applauded the maxims of La Rochefoucauld. Fontenelle shared with his con- temporaries the delight in sophisticated commentary upon man's social existence, and obviously thought the device of conversations between the illustrious dead an exceptional vehicle for it. With this in mind we may view the Dialogues as a set of practical rules for conduct, which Fontenelle doubtless intended them to be. We can also see them as containing in germ nearly all of the ideas that Fontenelle was to expound in later life. Much of his argument for sensi- ble living is an attack on system-builders. Life is too complex to admit of a single explanation, and those who speculate about metaphysics are only abusing their mental faculties, engaging in a futile exercise in reason; indeed reason itself is called into question. Of what use is it to the individual in the face of one's ultimate necessity, death? Fontenelle offers us more than a commentary on man's social existence: the Dialogues discuss the uncontrollable in man's experience, and they do so with no little insight. To be selfish, stupid, and a slave to his passions-that is man's lot. Even aspiration can be a snare; but a gifted few can use it to give meaning to their lives, thus turning the passions to good account. For ex- ample, the desire for fame may inspire a love of learning and a consequent cultivation of our reason. However, the Dialogues are only partly a plea for reason. Fontenelle, for all his attachment to science, never lost sight of the fact that there are other views of reality. His classical education and an early attach- ment to literature may help to explain his humanistic outlook on the world. Without such training his mind could not have perceived the beauty of science. With it he could see that science itself may depend in the last analysis upon man's passions. II If the implication of Madame de Tencin's remark was that Fontenelle had never loved, he nevertheless gave indications of understanding love's art. Love undeniably has its source in the bodily passions, says 2 Bayle, in the Nouvelles de la republique des lettres, janvier, 1686, had this to say about Fontenelle: "II a fait aussi les Nouveaux Dialogues des Morts qu'on a tant loue." The Dia- logues were retranslated in 1917 by no less a poet than Ezra Pound. 8 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="9">THE HUMAN CONDITION Fontenelle's Plato to Margaret of Scotland, repudiating so-called Platonic love. The spirit can cultivate the tree of love and benefit by the exercise, but it is the body that savors the fruit. The body's needs dictate its behavior, and most other rules are meaningless. All qualities must be made to serve in the game of love- beauty, wit, intelligence-and none must impede its progress. If the male has not always known this, the female has, for few women would not sooner see their virtue disparaged than their beauty or wit.3 Virtue, honor, pride: these encourage our passions and may belong on the battlefield, but they do little to assist in the game of love. We learn from experience not to honor a woman but to love her, "for honor spoils everything as soon as it makes its appearance. First comes woman's honor which is contrary to the interests of lovers; then, on its ruins lovers create another kind which is altogether contrary to the interests of women." 4 If there is such a thing as the art of love, then like any other art it must respect its medium. Although the human being functions in many ways, he must be careful never to mistake them. Reason plays no part in affairs of the heart: indeed, it very often has to wink at the behavior of its host. Thus Callirhee complains to Pauline that those women who believed that they had been visited by a God were the dupes of mortal men. Pauline replies that they were undoubtedly willing dupes. "What do you expect? I have heard it said by all sorts of wise men that if we did not help our deceivers along we would scarcely taste any pleasures." 5 At first blush these views appear strikingly Epi- curean, but we would be mistaken if we were to dismiss them out of hand as a glorification of pleasure-seeking. Fontenelle was arguing here the impossibility of escap- ing a fact of nature that all of us recognize to be important. This too may be called Epicurean; but if we add to the quality of inevitability the value of desirability we have something close to a psychological determination of ethics. It is possible to deny nature, Fontenelle says, but undesirable to do so, for happiness results from obeying her. Nature is the norm by which we should measure our actions and any act of reason not in accord with nature is doomed to failure. "All great deeds which men were compelled to do were done without reason. The order which nature seeks is always enforced; that is, what nature cannot obtain from our reason, she secures from our folly." 6 Further- more, it does no good to try to change anything against nature. "Things are as they should be and any at- tempted reform would only spoil everything," 7 for everything is in balance, and man, as he is constituted, is designed for pleasure. Provided we care only to act and not to know, we are equipped with all that we need 3 Les Dialogues des morts, (Euvres 1: 209. 4 Ibid., 309. Giges is speaking to Candoule. 5 Ibid., 301. 6 Ibid., 361. Lucretius is speaking. 7 Ibid., 234. This dialogue is between Sappho and Laura. for happiness. Happiness is a condition, and Mary Stuart denies the possibility of a successful quest for it. We cease to be happy just as soon as we make any effort to be so. If anyone felt the parts of his body working to keep him in good spirits, do you believe that he would feel good? Happiness is like health: it must be in men without having to be put there, and if there is a happiness of the mind it is like those states of health which are pro- duced only by remedies, and which are always very deli- cate and uncertain.8 It would appear, finally, that happiness is the absence of pain, the very condition of man's natural existence which is sustained, however, by moderation in all things. If there is anything certain about nature's laws it is the penalty they impose upon excess, even of virtue.9 This is the substance of Fontenelle's naturalistic fatalism. Fontenelle's view of nature is strikingly similar to Montaigne's, and not surprisingly, for the principle of moderation that the latter favored found a ready home in seventeenth-century France. Indeed, that principle can be said to be the basis for all social behavior as typified by the ideal of the honnete homme. Vulgarized to a degree by the gens du cours, the ideal nevertheless pointed to a link between the proper and the possible. But if Montaigne's cool skepticism provided a basis for social behavior in the seventeenth century, a more tragic view of man was not altogether absent. The poles of man's personality were revealed by Pascal with dramatic starkness when he opposed the mind and the heart. The better minds of France did not fail to be impressed by the vital contradiction in the life of this genius. Man vs. mind, heart vs. reason; must one surrender to the other or could the two be balanced in a life of purpose? Although Fontenelle argued for a state of natural happiness, there are serious doubts in the mind of his reader that he would have been content with that condition. Together with his case for correct living goes his recognition that we are often induced to live otherwise, which accounts for the ap- parent contradictions in the Dialogues, no less than the real contradictions in life. Fontenelle tells us that philosophy offers us nothing but trouble, but that knowledge may be preferable to happiness. After all, man is more than a simple child of nature, and his real satisfaction is to be derived from purposeful activity. Surely knowledge and happiness are equally legitimate goals of man, although the former is not often a natural inclination of his. The task then for Fontenelle is to reconcile the two desires, not simply for the sake of comfort, but for the purpose of harmonious living. The first step in doing so is to recognize that the primary position the passions occupy in our lives is essentially beneficial to us. It is true that they some- times cause us to act irrationally and to our own dis- advantage. For example, Faustine, in her desire to 8 Ibid., 379. 9 Ibid., 248. VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959] 9</page><page sequence="10">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE be punished for her infidelities to Marcus Aurelius, manifests the essential perversity of man, or at least of woman. But even if the passions harm us, they must not go unsatisfied, for they are the very breath of life, supplying the term "nature" with a meaning that Fontenelle had not hitherto made explicit. They are spurs to action, which may be blunted by knowledge. Nature has put men in the world to live there, and to live means not knowing what we do most of the time. When we discover the small importance of what we do and what concerns us we steal one of nature's secrets: we become too wise and we no longer wish to act, and that is what nature does not like.10 In this dialogue Parmenisque readily agrees with Theocritus that our rational faculty is what distin- guishes us from all other creatures, but Apparently nature did not intend for us to think with too much subtlety, for she sells that sort of thought at a high price. "You want to be reflective," she tells us, "take care. I will take my revenge by causing you sadness." 11 But we run an even greater risk by our attachment to reason. If reason were dominant, nothing would happen. People say that what pilots fear most of all are those peaceful seas where sailing is impossible, and what they want is a wind, even at the risk of a tempest. The passions are like the winds which are necessary to set things in motion, even though they often cause storms.12 What folly to hope for a life of the mind if by that is meant one divorced from feeling. But Fontenelle shows us a way out of the dilemma. Thought is also a form of action, and one no less dependent on the passions than the others. Sadness is the price we pay for it, as death may be the lot of the seaman. Fontenelle was quite unwilling to surrender the quest for knowl- edge to the needs of life, however much he valued the latter. III Although knowledge is a legitimate goal of man, what hope does he have of securing it? How limited is reason and how sterile philosophy, which does no more than applaud its own false virtues.13 Fontenelle held out little hope for philosophy in its quest for certitude. Fontenelle's Descartes voices this same doubt when he compares philosophy to a game that yields no practical results but only intellectual pleasure. To use reason in the search for certainty is to abuse that faculty, for everything is uncertain: "Fortune has been careful to accord varying success to similar endeavors in order to mock human reason which cannot have any sure 10 Ibid., 320. 11 Ibid., 320. 12 Ibid., 298. 13 Discours sur la patience, (Euvres 5: 305. In this discourse Fontenelle links the primacy of emotion over reason to re- ligion and to the Christian virtue of patience in suffering. He argues not for stoical resignation in the face of suffering, but for the necessity of the Christian to embrace it. rule." 14 Philosophy is furthest from the mark when it attempts to understand our passions rather than learn to use them and benefit from them. However, a certain limited real knowledge of the world is available to us, provided we can be satisfied with less than absolute certainty. Perhaps chance rules our every action; nevertheless an organized body of information is accumulated for us to use. Indeed chance itself may be another name for order. "Everything, then, is chance?" Erasmus asks. "Yes," answers Charles V, "provided we give this name to an order we know nothing of." 15 Awareness of this order has resulted in the natural sciences, which may not always tell us the cause of a phenomenon, but do at least assure us of positive fact. Furthermore, such positive knowl- edge has its uses. Although Harvey and Erasistratus are convinced of the vanity of medicine, seeing how no one is protected against death, yet Harvey believes that his investigations were worth while. "Perhaps we have not had the leisure to find some use for all we have recently learned, but it is impossible that with time we should not see some great results." 16 Let us be modest, then, in our expectations of truth, and patient in our researches, Fontenelle advises, and resist the tendency to fabricate explanations. But Fontenelle was painfully aware of the difficulties in the way of such a program. Never was he so nearly bitter as in his attack on the human fondness for mystery, which had done more than anything else to impede the progress of mankind. In at least three of the dialogues, Fontenelle decried man's susceptibility to superstition and self-deception. With superb irony Homer says to Aesop: You imagine that the human mind seeks only truth. Do not believe it. The human mind and the false get along extremely well. If you must tell the truth, clothe it in fables; it will be that much more pleasing. . . . The false enters the mind quite easily under its own colors, for that is where it is born and finds its home, and truth is a for- eigner there.17 How difficult it is for the human mind to be anything but muddled, obedient as it is to the supreme egoism of men. Neither beasts nor gods escape man's ar- rogance. "Men want the gods to be as crazy as they are, but they do not want the beasts to be as wise." 18 Not only idiocy, but the persistence of error in the face of enlightenment seems characteristic of man. "The truth is offered to him, but because it is simple he does not recognize it, taking ridiculous mysteries to be the truth only because they are mysteries." 19 However, this human, craving for mystery may not be without its uses, for mystery often serves as ex- 4 Les Dialogues des morts, (Euvres 1: 222. 15 Ibid., 271. 16 Ibid., 252 17Ibid., 217. 18 Ibid., 217. 19 Ibid., 370. 10 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="11">THE HUMAN CONDITION planation when a more rational one is lacking. Fonte- nelle's appreciation of this fact enabled him to perceive the historical usefulness of error and to recognize that abstract reason unaided cannot effect reform in men's mental habits. He drew attention to the complex workings of the mind when he had Raphael declare that prejudice filled an essential need: Reason will chase all these old opinions from our mind and will put no new ones in their place. That will cause a kind of void and who can suffer that? No, no, given so little reason among men, .they must have as many prejudices as they are accustomed to having. Prejudices are reason's supplement; whatever one fails to supply the other provides.20 That the false has its uses is so even in science. All the sciences have their chimeras which they pursue without success; but they pick up quite useful information along the way. If chemistry has its philosopher's stone, geometry has its squaring of the circle, astronomy its longitude, mechanics, perpetual movement. It is impos- sible to attain any of these, but quite useful to try.21 The fact that there are many twistings and turnings by which we arrive at truth should dispose us to judge our failures less harshly. Therefore, despite the ignorance of men, the limita- tions of reason, and the uncertainty of our enterprise, we do make progress, if only because we are no worse off as individuals than our predecessors, and ac- cumulated knowledge has set us ahead of them. The mere passage of time has enhanced the reputations of the ancients. Socrates tells Montaigne that we favor antiquity, "Because we are displeased with our own century, and antiquity benefits in consequence. Our posterity will esteem us more than we merit. But our ancestors, ourselves and our posterity are all equal," 22 and such equality is an intrinsic feature of the idea of progress. One of the things which prevented progress for so long was the blind worship of antiquity, caused in part by the reverence of the Renaissance for the classics. Fontenelle, while affirming the excellence of the ancients in literature, asserted the superiority of the moderns in science. The progressive nature of science caused the moderns to be the true ancients, adult heirs to the achievements of the Greeks who lived in the infancy of mankind. Although Fontenelle held to the belief in the pos- sibility of intellectual progress, nothing seemed so clear to him as the fact that man's morals remain forever the same. He did not believe in the unlimited per- fectibility of man: clothes may change, but that does not mean that the shape of bodies does. Manners or the lack of them, science or ignorance, more or less of a certain naivete, these are only man's externals, and they all change, but 20 Ibid., 356. 21 Ibid., 336. 22 Ibid., 238. the heart never changes, and all of man is contained in the heart.23 However, this fact too may be cause for rejoicing. Perhaps it is the heart, after all, that occasions progress, for from the heart springs the aspiration to accomplish- ment, no less a part of man than his reason. Truly it gets us no nearer to perfection, but men would never accomplish what they do if they did not, "propose a goal for themselves beyond their capacities. They would never start out if they knew that they would arrive only where they do. They must have before their eyes an imaginary goal which animates them . . . for they would lose courage if they were not sustained by false ideas." 24 Once again we are told that illusion has its uses. However, the impossibility of our goal ought not to prevent us from approaching it, nor does it any way diminish the value of our aspiration, which derives from its being an essential component of the human personality. If aspiration sometimes leads us astray, it is also the stuff from which our achievements spring, and in this regard it is one of the passions in that it provides the spur to thought and action. With- out the divine discontent which accompanies aspiration we are not likely to produce those things of the mind which are alike man's justification for living and society's hope for the future. None of the foregoing can be equated with the charge of personal egoism, pessimism, or disenchantment that some of Fontenelle's critics have leveled against him. Fontenelle has neither declared life to be unsupportable, nor has he ceased participating in it. The skepticism that he appropriated from antiquity does not lead him to detachment, nor his Stoicism to renunciation. We are indeed passionate animals, but if this fact causes us pain and difficulty, it is also the source of our spiritual glory. It is this glory to be found partly in scientific achievement which Fontenelle regards as the real re- ward for living. Although our bodies generate our impulses, our minds direct them, imposing order upon a collection of random impulses. Fontenelle neither denied nor undervalued the intelligence but sought to preserve its preeminence by limiting it, for in that way is its essential structure preserved. The balance of mind and body was Fontenelle's prescription for happiness in the Dialogues; his acceptance of the human condition was in the last analysis hopeful. To talk about an achievement of mind arrived at in the quietude of resignation is a contradiction in terms, he argued. There is a form of skepticism in the Dialogues, but of a different kind from Montaigne's. Although the slogan of "Que scai-je?" was accepted in seventeenth- century France as part of the cultural if not the political fabric of the time, it remained for Fontenelle to show how science might broaden and deepen Montaigne's 23 Ibid., 239. 24 Ibid., 336. VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959] 11</page><page sequence="12">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE humanism. Our minds must be fed in a manner suit- able to their care, judging neither on faith nor on reason alone, nor even entirely on the evidence of the senses. It would seem that nothing is ever conclusively proved, so that a skeptical attitude is called for in the face of authority and a suspended judgment till all the evidence is in. Fontenelle doubted the inherent superiority of the ancients, or of the Europeans over the Aztecs, and thus was led to a healthy skepticism in historical matters. This was part of the critical atti- tude that grew with science, depending not on meta- physical speculation concerning the human condition, but on empirical evidence for human behavior. Science was the significant addition to Fontenelle's humanist training, assimilated to the older, more traditional disciplines giving them direction and content. Fonte- nelle's was not the negative skepticism of the Pyr- rhonist, but the positive variety of the scientist whose discipline requires him to stay within the limits of verifiable evidence. This respect for positive knowl- edge, however, did not involve him in materialism; his appreciation for the complexity of life saved him from that fate, and his view of science as idea required him to construct a theoretical framework for it that was notable for its humanistic character. Fontenelle be- lieved that the value of science derived from the search itself, in answer to man's need to know. But if science was perhaps a new means to discern God's plan for the universe, then surely mankind had to grow in wisdom and humility to be worthy of it. To abolish pride of ignorance, to teach mankind to spurn the false in favor of the truly marvelous, to induce it to be satisfied with less than absolute certainty was Fon- tenelle's hope for science. III. CARTESIAN PHYSICS IN FONTENELLE: THE LAW OF NATURE I The majority of his biographers have declared Fon- tenelle to be a Cartesian, and much has been said about the influence of Descartes upon French science during the course of Fontenelle's life. Inasmuch as these propositions label more than two generations of French science, it is surprising to note how often they have gone unchallenged. To say that Fontenelle was a Cartesian requires us to ask what Descartes meant to him. A close look at Fontenelle's thought should convince us that he accepted no more than the master's cosmology, and for reasons that were as much a chal- lenge to Descartes as they were to Newton. Further- more, Fontenelle's rejection of Descartes' metaphysics and method, which do much more to define the latter's philosophy of science than the famous tourbillons, suggests that designating Fontenelle a Cartesian entails a serious misuse of that term. Of course, it was common enough for thinkers to select from among the major strands of Descartes's work, but Cartesianism becomes more than just a matter of terminology when we remember how important the questions of meaning and method were for seventeenth-century science. An examination of Fontenelle's thought on this subject, and of the extent to which it was an accurate re- flection of French scientific opinion, should help to clarify both his philosophy and the essential character of science in his time. It has been clear that the Cartesian achievement can be separated into four categories: his work in mathe- matics, his physics, the metaphysics, and the method. I should like to add still another that has been recognized to be as important as his contribution to mathematics, namely the example of doubt that he set for the gen- erations of French scientists who followed him, and who were required to continue the struggle against authority in the realm of ideas. We will see this to be one of the major tasks of Fontenelle in his role as spokesman for science. The Cartesian mathematics, metaphysics, and method, all intimately related, will be discussed two chapters hence, although they shall certainly form a part of our discussion by implication in these earlier chapters. What concerns us here, however, is the physics which Fontenelle adopted for the Pluralite des mondes, and continued to support throughout his life. Fontenelle's Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes stands as a recognized landmark in the popularization of science, which all critics have honored, not the least being some of his own contemporaries.1 Coming as it did in 1686, just one year before the publication of Newton's Principia was to assure the success of the Copernican system, the Entretiens provides a cogent and smoothly flowing argument for that system, and particularly for the Cartesian interpretation of it. It has been suggested that Descartes's plenum and his vortices served to make the heliocentric theory more palatable to theology, perhaps designed with that end in view.2 In any case the struggle over its acceptance had reached the point where Fontenelle could write a work of popularization, unlike his predecessor, Bishop Wilkins, who had to make his a learned apology. A change had taken place in the intervening fifty years, 1 Bayle, P., Nouvelles de la republique des lettres, mai, 1686. Bayle gives it a good review, calling it a "gallant" piece of work, but profound. Twenty-eight editions of the Entretiens appeared in Fontenelle's lifetime. Montesquieu praised it in a work that I cite in Chapter V, and Voltaire's comments have already been referred to in Chapter I. 2 See Dorothy Stimson, The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe, New York, 1917. Whether this was Fontenelle's motive in publishing the Entretiens is debatable. There was a great interest in the heavens, and much astronomical activity in France dating from 1680 when Halley's comet appeared. Fontenelle may have simply been responding to a public demand for such a work. We know that other treatises were published on the subject in the few years preceding his own, notably that of the Abbe de Gerard. See Shackleton, ed., Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes, 7, Oxford, The Clarendon Press, 1955. 12 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="13">CARTESIAN PHYSICS IN FONTENELLE owing perhaps to the influence of Descartes, or per- haps to the fact that the Academie des Sciences was carrying on so much of its own work in the area of astronomy. What is certain, however, is that the battle for Copernicanism had very nearly been won, so that a work of popularization, addressed to the elite, could meet with success at that time. Pascal gave evidence of being painfully aware of the infinity of the Copernican universe, which is its signal feature. However, the fact of diffusion of the Copernican idea among the intellectuals, and of continued interest in the Entretiens well into the eighteenth century, raises some questions concerning the intention of that work. The title reads "plurality," and not infinity, of worlds, and, although the two ideas were linked in the seventeenth century, the former did not depend on the latter for its existence. It can be argued that the question of in- habitants in other worlds was used as so much window- dressing for Fontenelle's main stock of cosmological information. However, Fontenelle gave every evidence of taking the question seriously, and, if his discussion of plurality was at least as important to him as that of infinity, then Fontenelle attempted more than a popular- ization of the Copernican-Cartesian universe. It is the author's belief that the latter cosmology was itself used to shake certain fundamental intellectual assumptions, and to introduce others of a scientific nature, which were far more important to Fontenelle than the fact of allegiance to the Cartesian vortices. In his preface to the Pluralite des mondes, Fontenelle said that Cicero, when he was translating Greek works into Latin, was told that it was useless to do so, for those who wanted to read the works would go to the original, and those who would not learn Greek would be disinclined to read them in the Latin. Cicero replied that those who were not philosophers would become so by reading the translation and that those who were would be interested to see how the original fared in Latin. This is how Fontenelle defined the purpose of his work. Its spirit is contained in the following line: "It seems that nothing ought to interest us more than knowing how this world we inhabit is made, and whether there are other worlds like it which may be inhabited also." 3 We are assured that he has told the truth about physics, and that he has harbored no subversive thoughts, for there are those who will be displeased at the thought of men in the moon, suspecting that their religion would be endangered by the existence of human beings of which the Bible makes no mention. Fontenelle declared to the righteous that whatever creatures there are on the moon would not be men, on the principle that God, having displayed an infinite diversity of creation here on earth, would most certainly have created other creatures for other worlds. 3 Fontenelle, Les Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes, preface, (Euvres 2: iii. This idea is basic to his argument for a plurality of worlds. Fontenelle's visit with an unnamed marquise serves as the occasion for the six dialogues that tell about the universe and its mode of operation. The first evening is given over to a discussion of the earth's rotation and revolution about the sun, in which Fontenelle has a chance to expound the Copernican system. The sec- ond chapter describes the appearance and behavior of the moon, and considers the possibility of inhabitants on that body. The same treatment is accorded the planets in the third, while the solar system as a whole is explained in terms of the Cartesian vortex in the chapter that follows. The last conversation expands the field of the vortices to include the fixed stars and the systems of planets that Fontenelle was sure they carry with them. To these five conversations is added a sixth in which the author provided a metaphysical foundation for the description offered previously. We shall say more about this later. It becomes clear in the first dialogue that Fontenelle relied on the Cartesian theory of matter for his physical explanation, to say nothing of the vortices which he discussed later. In this case it is the principle of im- pulsion that is made explicit. "Thus one no longer believes that a body moves unless it is pulled or rather pushed by another-philosophy has become quite me- chanical . . . we want the universe to be no more than a watch, but on a large scale."4 Nature is simply a machine whose springs are concealed, and the philosopher has become a mechanic who searches for them. Does this diminish the importance of nature or the philosopher who probes it? Not at all. The joy is to be found in comprehension, not in mystifica- tion. "Some admire nature only because they believe it to be a kind of magic which we do not understand at all; and something is sure to be disdained by them just as soon as it may be understood a little." 5 Fon- tenelle's love of nature, on the contrary, was the mature one of familiarity. The principle of fullness together with that of im- pulsion comprises the Cartesian cosmology of vortices. Each whirlpool, filled with a subtle matter and pressing outward with centrifugal force, is held in place, Fon- tenelle explained, by the pressure of an infinite number of vortices on its periphery. The mechanical principle is extended to explain comets as planets which have escaped other vortices, and the disappearance of stars as the result of crusting over. This explanation, which Fontenelle was to offer again as late as 1752, had the virtue of doing without meaningless phrases and the fanciful speculation of the schoolmen, he declared. What distinguished this as a scientific description from the philosophical explanations that had preceded it, was the clarity, precision, and order which the description 4 Ibid., 19. 5 Ibid., 20. 13 VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959]</page><page sequence="14">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE afforded. The latter characteristics would seem to be criteria for the truthfulness of the theory. Entirely different criteria were brought into play when Fontenelle considered the question of a plurality of worlds. He discounted the possibility of life on the moon on the basis of Huygen's work which pointed out the absence of atmosphere there. However, he made a strong case for the planets which he considered to be inhabited on the basis of four arguments. First, he believed that where the planets are like the earth in what is apparent, there is every likelihood that they are similar in other particulars. This analogy had been a popular argument for the plurality of worlds during the sixteenth century. His second defense also rests on an analogy. Inasmuch as nature is discovered to be fruitful here on earth, producing a multiplicity and diversity of things, there is no reason to suppose that she is not fruitful elsewhere. This traditional assump- tion about the goodness and fecundity of the Creator was strengthened in the seventeenth century by the finding of the microscopists.6 The third argument may be stated negatively: to suppose the planets uninhabited is to assume a wanton wastefulness on the part of nature. The fourth argument follows the preceding assumption. Any definition of the Deity which assumes the infinity and fecundity of His creation must assume that He has created for use (which is not the same thing as saying that He has created for man's use). It did not occur to Fontenelle to consider that a mechanism of evolution producing varying forms of life could have been present, or absent altogether, in other worlds. His arguments for life are based on analogies that are essentially mechanical, but the as- sumptions made in its favor stem from a different source. They are traditionally religious; they are even aesthetic. These two areas of experience were familiar to Fontenelle when he turned to the sphere of science. How else can we explain the sincerity with which he says, "My imagination is overwhelmed by the infinite multitude of inhabitants of all these planets, and per- plexed by the diversity there must be among them; for I see that inasmuch as nature is averse to repeti- tion, she must have made them all different." 7 The Pluralite des mondes is only partially an apology for a mechanical model of the universe. There is at least the recognition in it of a distinction between the physical and the biological sciences, so that if there is a single law for all phenomena in the world, the laws of me- chanics would be only one expression of it. Although Fontenelle hinted at an element of chance in the operation of the universe, he believed that the universe came about by design of the Creator. Chance 6 See A. 0. Lovejoy, The great chain of being, Cambridge, 1936. Professor Lovejoy considers these assumptions within the context of his argument for the great chain of being which he declares to have undergone a transmutation in the light of the findings of seventeenth-century science. 7 Les Entretiens, CEuvres 2: 82. is to be understood in a moralistic sense only. In discussing the number of moons that are possessed by Jupiter and the earth, Fontenelle said that had our planet come into Jupiter's vortex, "We would be only one of its moons . . .; thus it is true that chance often decides our entire fortune." 8 The design itself, how- ever, is distinguished by order, and surprisingly, an order "which rests on such simple things"; 9 but where is the principle of order to be found in the universe, and is the design to be defined in terms of simplicity? It is at this point that Fontenelle made two of his most important assumptions, which define the content of his science and distinguish between the physical and biolog- ical sciences. He tells us that magnificence is to be found in the design of the world, but economy is its principle of execution. It would seem, interrupted the Marquise, that your phi- losophy is a kind of auction where those who offer to do things at least cost, win out over the others. It is true, I answered, and it is only in that fashion that we can grasp the plan by which nature has done its work. It involves an extraordinary economy; anything that she can do at less cost to herself, be the difference ever so slight, rest assured she will do in that manner. Nevertheless, this economy accords with a surprising magnificence, which shines in everything she has done: that is because the magnificence is in the design, and economy in the execu- tion. There is nothing so beautiful as a grand design that one executes with few means.10 There is no contradiction between magnificence and economy, for both reflect a law of nature that may be defined in terms of deity, either a deity made natural, or nature itself deified. Richness and economy, the latter arguing for infinity, the former for plurality, became the pivotal points of Fontenelle's thought about science. It was when he viewed the infinite universe that Fontenelle found the Cartesian mechanics so direct and appealing, perhaps because of its logic, but even more because it breathed the spirit of universal law into him. It was this aspect of science which Fontenelle made the foundation stone for his intellectual edifice. He gave voice to his belief in it when he said in the Histoire de l'Academie: The same laws reign everywhere; the works of nature rest on the same principles, and are executed in the same manner as those fashioned by art; and when I raise my hand there is a force which raises a weight by means of a lever. This mechanics which is hidden to the eyes and rendered even more invisible by the ease with which natural move- ments are carried out, is not any less real for all that."1 To arrive finally at the law behind the law is the pur- pose of the scientist; to move from the appearance of 8 Ibid., 101. 9 Ibid., 19. 10 Ibid., 25. 11 L'Histoire de l'Acadeinie des Sciences (hereafter referred to as H.A.), 1702: 126.

SOC.</page><page sequence="15">CARTESIAN PHYSICS IN FONTENELLE things to the further reality is the task of the physicist. For example, if change would seem to be the law of life, then it takes only an act of imagination to conceive of a state of permanence beyond the appearance, which borders on the conservation of matter. For I expect that if the old stars disappeared, new ones would appear; the species must renew itself. We do not have to be afraid that it will perish. ... I believe that the universe may have been constructed in such a way that new stars will form from time to time. If matter is ca- pable of forming a sun, then being once dispersed, should it not be able to come together again and lay the founda- tions for a new universe? I am rather inclined to believe in this idea, for it corresponds to the high idea which I have of the works of nature.12 Here nature seems to have achieved an independence from God, in so far as it operates according to a uni- versal law that inheres in matter. It is in the guise of an analogous law of nature that Fontenelle presented his arguments for life elsewhere. The design is a rich one, its fruits being visible on earth. Therefore, a multitude of creatures is to be expected throughout the universe, and a diversity of forms. A law of nature requires that there be no extreme dissimilarity between one planet and another. Where there are worlds created, Fontenelle argued, they are certainly meant to be used by living forms. Finally, everything is alive, everything is animated .... Do you believe that after nature has pushed her fecundity to excess here on earth, she has been so sterile with the other planets as to produce nothing? 13 The fact that conditions on the moon offered little hope for inhabitants is relatively unimportant to Fontenelle. It is more to the point to consider that distance and different physical surroundings would produce creatures that were certainly different from men. I do not for one moment believe that there are men on the moon. Notice how the face of nature changes between here and China; other faces, other forms. . . . Between here and the moon the change must be even more considerable. . . . Whoever gets to the moon will surely find creatures different from men there.14 Furthermore, even if the physical surrounding could not be held responsible for the difference there would surely be one, on the principle of change and variety in the world. Europeans . . . Africans ... Tartars. . . . What secret nature must have had to vary in so many ways something so simple as a face? We are as a small family in the universe whose faces all resemble each other; on another planet there is another family, whose faces have a different look.15 There is, then, this curious two-sidedness to Fontenelle's conception of universal law. It existed in nature's mode 12Les Entretiens, CEuvres 2: 135. 3 Ibid., 82. 4Ibid., 56. 5 Ibid., 83. of operation, but it also existed, Fontenelle believed, in its intentions. Out of the confused welter of existence a pattern emerges, he tells us, by which the heavenly bodies move according to one law, and are inhabited according to another which states the necessity for nature to produce, to people its planets, and to do so with a profusion of forms. The first kind of law, so important to physics, depended on God only to the extent of his initial desire. God, the watchmaker of the eighteenth-century philosophes, was proclaimed by Fontenelle in 1686. The second kind of law spoke of nature in the manner of the religious, who has long insisted on God's goodness and bounty, but here too nature was given its independence from God, that is, made subject to law. The two varieties of law may really be one and the same, contained in God, or in nature, we cannot be sure which. However, if it is God that Fontenelle was speaking about, then his ideas give us a clue to the manner of Deity he envisaged. He is the very essence of order, ruled by it even in the magnificence of His plan. If the two kinds of law are linked in nature, as an expression of matter, then Fontenelle spoke for scientific naturalism in which, however, the distinction between inanimate and animate things is preserved. It was Fontenelle's concern with the latter subject, as discussed under the heading of plurality, which has been slighted in most treatments of the Entretiens. The Entretiens is an invitation to the study of the life sciences as well as the mechanical ones; the plurality of worlds was as important a subject to Fontenelle as their infinity. II The idea of a plurality of worlds has had a long and honorable history. The Epicureans had speculated on the possibility of an infinite universe, and the same subject had served Lucian as the basis for a romance. Although the Epicurean point of view had serious im- plications for philosophy, it had no foundation in con- crete scientific work, so that what it offered the seven- teenth century was no more than a tradition that appealed to the free-thinker.16 However, what the Epicureans devised without the help of God, the school- men were perfectly willing to accept on theological grounds. The principle of infinite causes, infinite effects, justified the speculation that other systems derived from God's plenitude. St. Thomas thought rightly that infinity was impossible within the context of Aristotelian physics; nevertheless, the idea grew as a consequence of its metaphysical implications in the two centuries that followed Aquinas. With the publica- tion of the De Revolutionibus of Copernicus, however, 16 The doctrine of a plurality of worlds has fascinated Pro- fessor Grant McColley, whose work on the subject has empha- sized mostly the philosophic background for the seventeenth- century expression of it.

Much has been written about the importance and significance of the Copernican revolution, and I do not propose to consider the question here except as it re- lates to the subject under discussion. Two very ob- vious points need only to be mentioned. Copernicus provided a new point d'appui for the conception of other worlds, designating the earth as one among several planets, thereby destroying its uniqueness as a celestial body. He also enlarged the diameters of the stars, and increased the distance to them, so that if he did not espouse the idea of an infinite universe, his work lent credibility to it. From the Copernican notion that the earth is a planet, it is a short leap to the idea that the planets are so many earths, containing life and inhabited by a variety of creatures. From the belief in a heliocentric theory, it is another short leap to the idea that other suns are possessed of systems of their own. There are really two ideas involved then in the seventeenth-century belief in a plurality of worlds: an infinite universe, that derived from Copernicus' work, and the habitability of worlds, which was a further implication of it. Some thinkers were to accept the first proposition while denying the second, which was the more dangerous one. It was Bruno who first clearly formulated a meta- physics that was to provide a congenial home for the idea of a plurality of worlds. His cosmology appears to be a blend of Plato and Copernicus, both of whom sought beyond the senses for the unifying principle of the universe. That principle, for Bruno, was a God who was not above all nature, in the medieval Aris- totelian sense, but within nature and in every part of it. Thus a romantic pantheism was created that was in opposition to the theocentric world of the Middle Ages which was essentially mechanical in its physical prin- ciples. Bruno argued that if the Deity is infinite, as he must be, then his works are infinite too. This idea drew on the Copernican reversal of the center of the world which supplied Bruno with a relativism that allowed no limit to the universe and no central point. Developed further this led to a clear statement of the relativity of place, motion, and time, and the destruc- tion of the Aristotelian idea of absolute heaviness in the center of the earth. A particle of the sun will fall to the sun just as a particle of earth will fall to the earth. Nature is everywhere the same. What we find on earth we must assume to occur elsewhere, including life itself, which idea was for Bruno not only an exten- sion of the Copernican theory, but dependent on his view of God. Although metaphysical speculation only, and unconfirmed by evidence such as Galileo was to make available, Bruno's thinking can be seen to have provided a new basis for speculation about the plurality of worlds,17 and one that ran counter to traditional theology. Bruno contributed still another idea that was to grow in importance throughout the seventeenth century. Although his God is to be found everywhere in the universe, He is knowable only through the laws of nature. Therefore, Bruno would not have us spend time considering the Deity. Nature is man's proper problem and he should serve it with all his reason. This thought was echoed by Galileo,18 and Bacon, by the founders of the Academie des Sciences who wanted to be free to pursue scientific inquiry without theological controversy, and by Bishop Wilkins who asked that the Bible's silence about a plurality of worlds not be taken literally.19 Having entered the climate of opinion, this belief became indispensable to the scientists of the seventeenth century and a chief article in Fontenelle's creed. It is unnecessary at this point to consider Galileo's influence upon the thought of the seventeenth century, but we may consider a work by one of his followers that contributed in no small measure to the success of Fontenelle's "Plurality of Worlds." The Apologia pro Galileo of Tommasso Campanella was first published in 1616, and achieved rapid popularity in England and France.20 Bishop Wilkins, whose work was to serve as a model to Fontenelle, specifically mentioned Cam- panella, and referred to the latter's attempt to solve the theological problems arising out of the belief in men on the moon or on the planets. Such men would have had to be saved by Christ if the meaning of His sacrifice was to be retained, but it was hard to see how this could have been effected. Fontenelle, we have seen, like Wilkins, dodged the issue by insisting that the creatures elsewhere were not men, and were thereby absolved of sin. Campanella managed to satisfy him- self with the idea that, if the inhabitants of the moon were men, they could not be infected with Adam's sin, but had perhaps others from which they were delivered by the death of Christ. This was a point at issue 17 The impact of Galileo's discoveries of mountains on the moon, and sunspots, has of course been noted by many investi- gators in this area. Here, we need only note that it lent sup- port to the belief in the uniformity of nature. 18 Galileo, in a letter to Castelli, dated December 21, 1613, said, "I think that in discussing natural phenomena we ought not to begin with texts from scripture but with experiment and demonstration, for from the divine word scripture and nature do alike proceed," as quoted by J. J. Fahrie, Galileo, his life and work, 250, London, 1903. 19 Wilkins, in his Discovery of a new world, says in his second and third propositions, "That the places of scripture, which seem to intimate the diurnal motion of the sun or heavens, are fairly capable of another interpretation. That the Holy Ghost, in many places of scripture does plainly con- form His expressions to the error of our conceits, and does not speak of sundry things as they are in themselves, but as they appear unto us." 20 Mersenne, who did so much to acquaint the French with Galileo, was also responsible for introducing his apologist into France. 16 [TRANS.

Although Bishop Wilkins specifically acknowledged his debt to Campanella and to the Italian tradition of Copernicanism, it ought not to be overlooked that there was an interest in Copernicus which was native to Eng- land. The Copernican ideas were given circulation in 1576 when Thomas Digges published his father's Prog- nostication Everlasting, with the addition of his own preface entitled, "A Description of the Celestial Orbes." 21 Gilbert is known to have consulted it, and it has been asserted by Johnson that the diagrams in- serted in Wilkins' book were patterned after the one that Digges used in his. Thomas Digges is credited not only with popularizing Copernicus at this early date but with extending the universe to infinity some ten years before Bruno was to do so. We find Digges sounding the theme of right reason which was to have so many variations throughout the course of the seventeenth century.22 This theme was repeated by Wilkins and like much else that Wilkins emphasized, was "in the air," but it is not too much to expect that the good Bishop was indebted to Digges as well as to Cam- panella, especially for the idea of infinity. In 1638 Bishop Wilkins published his first work entitled The Discovery of a New World (the moon), to be followed in 1640 by a supplement to it called A Discourse that the Earth may be a Planet. Both works were translated into French in 1655, and by 1684 five editions of both books had appeared in English, attesting to their popularity in the mother country. Prefacing his remarks with an appeal to those ancients who had hitherto been neglected (re- miniscent of Bacon's attempt to resurrect Democritus and Epicurus), Wilkins set forth a series of proposi- tions that follow from the climate of opinion which we have already described. Propositions four through thirteen of the "discovery" set forth the points of 21 For a full discussion of Digges' contribution, see Johnson &amp; Larkey, Thomas Digges, the Copernican system and the idea of the infinity of the universe in 1576, The Huntington Library Bulletin, April, 1934. 22 Johnson and Larkey quoted Digges as saying, "Why shall we so much dote in the appearance of our senses, which in many ways may be abused, and not suffer ourselves to be directed by the rule of Reason which the great God had given us as a lamp to lighten the darkness of our understanding and the perfect guide to lead us to the golden branch of verity amidst the forest of errors." This early attack on the senses, to be repeated by Galileo, casts an interesting light on the formation of the idea of science. It is not of course an attack on sense observation, but an attack on the reliance on the senses as proof of a scientific hypothesis. Conversely, the word reason, which many commentators on French science have identified with the Cartesian use of it, is meant to designate a court of last appeal, and not a method for investigation. We shall have more to say about the Cartesian reversal of the roles of sense and reason and the French rejection of this Cartesian outlook. similarity between the earth and the moon. Both are "Compacted and spacious bodies. That as their world is our Moon, so our world is their moon." On the basis of these analogies, "'Tis probable there may be inhabitants in this other world; but of what kind they are is uncertain." 23 Here we arrive at the question of habitability; Wilkins offered a series of propositions in support of it. The first argument of the discourse is an echo of its like number in the Discovery: "That the strangeness of this opinion is no sufficient reason why it should be rejected, because other certain truths have been formerly esteemed ridiculous, and great absurdities entertained by common consent." Having benefited by the discoveries of Galileo, Wilkins affirmed that the heavens do not consist of pure matter, and are there- fore not exempt from corruption and change. There is no reason, then, why this abode of corruption, the earth, should not find a home among the other planets, or why the planets should not be inhabited. However, his major defense was the disclaimer to theology, which was characteristic of his time. The Bishop insisted that it is dangerous to philosophy to interpret scripture literally, that indeed it was not meant to be so interpreted, and further, that a strict interpretation may produce varying conclusions. Therefore, "There is not any argument from the words of Scripture, Principles of Nature, or observations in Astronomy which can sufficiently evidence the earth to be in the center of the universe," or any principle of reason or faith which is contradicted by a plurality of worlds.24 Whether it was due to the time or place of publication that Wilkins' work met with acceptance, I am not pre- pared to say, but the fact remains that he did not meet with the kind of opposition that other thinkers we have mentioned encountered on the continent. Despite ecclesiastical opposition however, the idea of a plurality of worlds did receive some support on the continent as well as in England. Galileo admitted that there might be life on the planets, but questioned the existence of a plurality of worlds, perhaps because the idea was too dangerous to espouse openly. In France, Descartes expressed belief in both, without making too much of a point of it. Pascal avowed his faith in infinity while denying habitability.25 Fontenelle was 23 John Wilkins, Bishop, A discovery of a new world, that the earth is a planet, fifth ed., propositions 11 and 12, London, J. Rawline, 1684. 24 Ibid., proposition 6. The discovery, prop. 2. Other propo- sitions that follow state, "That there is not any sufficient reason to prove the earth incapable of those motions which Copernicus ascribes unto it. That it is more probable the earth does move than the heavens. That this hypothesis is exactly agreeable to common appearances." There is a good deal of "common sense" in Wilkins' appeal to reason. 25 See A. 0. Lovejoy, op. cit., passim. Professor Lovejoy argues that the questions of infinity and plurality were couched in terms of plenitude and sufficient reason that attached to the idea of the Great Chain of Being. 17 VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959]</page><page sequence="18">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE heir to all of this, and especially to a romance by Cyrano de Bergerac (1649), which had achieved a great degree of popularity.26 However, Fontenelle's work is decidedly different from Cyrano's, so that we may guess that the former had had no intention of writing a popular romance. It might have seemed to him that Bishop Wilkins' work sounded just the right note of seriousness to serve as a model for his own. We have no direct evidence that he read the earlier work, but a brief comparison of his product with the English one, and statements from his biographers suggest that he did. With the exception of Fontenelle's failure to make more than the briefest apology to theology, it is clear that his arguments follow the analogical pattern of his predecessor. Although Fontenelle disavowed the notion of life on the moon, he availed himself of Wilkins' argument for it to prove its possibility on the planets. Wilkins' conclusion is reached by the analogy of similar physical conditions. The moon is like the earth, Wilkins stated, for it is opaque, "hath not any light of her own . . . that the spots represent the sea and the brighter parts the land." Similarly, Fon- tenelle pointed out that the planets move about the sun as the earth does, are all opaque, receive light and reflect it, the presumption being that the invisible com- ponents are as similar to each other as the visible ones. Wilkins said what Fontenelle was to echo: "Now if our Earth were one of the planets . . . then why may not another of the planets be an earth." 27 I have already alluded to the fact that both Fontenelle and Wilkins used the same device to escape the theo- logical problem of men in the moon. Both writers end their sections about the moon by predicting that one day men will fly there, and both, in strikingly similar passages, declare their expectation of disbelief and derision from vulgar wits. The best statement that can be made on the subject of influence, however, is to quote the Abbe Trublet who wrote after Fontenelle's death: If any work could have given M. de Fontenelle his idea for the Plurality of Worlds, it is the one called "The World in the Moon, divided in two books, the first, proving that the moon may be a world; the second, that the earth may be a planet . . . published at Rouen, 1656." The author ... is Dr. John Wilkins. He published it in English in 1638.... But if sometimes one finds the same thoughts in the two books, it is only because they are on the same subject.28 26 Cyrano de Bergerac, Voyage dans la lune, 1649. Gassendi also concerned himself with this question in chapter 6 of his Syntagma philosophicum, entitled, "Si les astres sont habi- tables" (1658). 27 Wilkins, op. cit., 61. 28 Trublet, Memoires a servir, 249. Later writers, notably Maigron, Carre, and Shackleton agree that Fontenelle was di- rectly influenced by Wilkins in his formulation of the En- tretiens. Despite Trublet's disclaimer, it is more than likely that Fontenelle borrowed some of his ideas from Wilkins, for, like Wilkins, Fontenelle treated the subject of plurality seriously, and, except for Gassendi whose work was hidden from the public, was the first in France to do so. There is no doubt that Fontenelle's Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes exercised a wide and important influence upon the ideas of his time. Specifically, we have the little work Cosmotheoros, written by Christian Huygens in 1698 in imitation of the earlier book,29 and it is the Abbe Trublet's belief that Voltaire was prompted to write a popularization of Newtonianism by the example that Fontenelle had set. Francesco Al- garotti almost certainly used the Entretiens as a model for his own handbook for the ladies. More im- portant than imitation, however, is Fontenelle's in- fluence in extending the ideas of scientific law by which the Copernican universe was governed. By the end of the century the educated Frenchman, and woman, had seen the walls of the universe shattered, and the fixed stars scattered to vast distances, creating either a wonderful or frightening picture of astronomical infinity. He was assured that throughout infinity one law pre- vailed, and that that law was simplicity itself. Unless his mind took a Pascalian turn, he could say with Fontenelle that the discovery of these facts was a source of joy to him. Furthermore, joy might derive from learning that we are not the center of creation. If other worlds are no more perfect than ours, then we have a right to suppose them inhabited on the principles of plenitude and sufficient reason, or on the basis of nature's own revealed capacity to produce a staggering variety of creatures. What cause for optimism, for other crea- tures may possess a rationality superior to our own, or at the very least, keep us company in our idiocy. A plurality of worlds suggested attitudes of mind in keeping with Fontenelle's own fine sense of humility. It is perhaps as a consequence of this attitude that Fontenelle insisted upon the relativity of all things to the observer. Three kinds of relativity may be dis- tinguished in the Entretiens. In his description of the Copernican universe, Fontenelle took the oppor- tunity to emphasize that nature was not created ex- clusively for our use. He presumes that other planets exist to be used by creatures, but to suggest that the universe was designed solely with the human being in mind does no more than express human egotism. In another dialogue he described the lands throughout the earth, pointing out the diversity of customs to be found on his tour, and suggesting that a relative criterion for manners ought to be possible for Europeans. The 29 Bell, A. E., in Christian Huygens and the development of science in the seventeenth century, 200, New York, 1947, says, "The little work, 'Cosmotheoros,' written by Huygens and published posthumously in 1698, appears therefore to be written in imitation of Fontenelle. .. ." 18 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="19">CARTESIAN PHYSICS IN FONTENELLE same point is made in one of the conceits in the book. The inhabitants of the milky way would not have night and day because their suns are so close together, and when told that we do, "they would regard us as beings disgraced by nature, and our condition would induce spasms of horror in them." 30 There is yet a third way in which the Fontenellian relativity is apparent. Throughout this work as indeed throughout all the others, there runs the epistemological questions: Can we know anything? How much can we know? What correspondence is there between the human intellect and the world of nature? Such thoughts, based on Fontenelle's skepticism, obviously were intrinsic to the scientific attitude of mind. Brief mention has been made of Fontenelle's use of the idea of chance to guard against arrogance. His numerous references to it are further meant to offset that kind of certainty of thought, theological and metaphysical, which logically predetermines ideas. Fon- tenelle preferred to submit science to no authority, nor his audience to his own. He concluded his talks with the Marquise by telling her that she had enough in- formation at that point to believe nothing but what her own good sense permitted.31 She is cautioned through- out the conversations to leap to no conclusions, to consider the evidence before arriving at one, and when one has finally been drawn, to be sure that it is done so tentatively. The book is quite clear about the need to escape authority and closed systems, the need to maintain open-ended truths. Although the intention of the work was certainly to popularize the Copernican-Cartesian universe, it was clearly Fontenelle's purpose in addition to impart at- titudes of skepticism and relativism; and in this task the idea of plurality served admirably well. Together with the belief in a universal law of nature these attitudes acted as a leaven in the rise of scientific ideas, and were in turn made more precise in the process. If other contemporaries were saying the same things, nevertheless, as Professor Lovejoy points out, "The Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes of Fontenelle no doubt did more than any other single writing to diffuse these ideas among the educated classes gen- erally." 32 III The cosmology of the Entretiens, and its prin- ciples of physics are avowedly Cartesian, but it is quite another thing to say that it was Fontenelle's intention to popularize Cartesian rationalism. The year 1686 when it was published was still the pre-Newtonian age, and the behavior of the vortices could be described ac- cording to known principles of dynamics. How im- portant the vortices were in the pattern of Fontenelle's 30 Les Entretiens, (Euvres 2: 124. 31 Ibid., 137. 3 Lovejoy, op. cit., 130. thought remains to be ascertained, but we can have no doubt about his freedom from slavish imitation of the master. His acceptance of the vortex theory was based on what he considered to be the best explanation to be derived from the senses. Fontenelle was not the man of "Reason" that Carre has made him out to be, for as early as 1686, he recognized the necessity of basing reason on the senses. In the first dialogue Fontenelle stated that philosophy is based upon curious minds and bad eyes; for the curious-minded man concerns him- self with questions about the universe, and his "bad eyes" make it necessary for him to devise instruments with which to probe it. He concluded the fifth dialogue with a statement to the Marquise that he chose not to speculate beyond what he could see. And to tell you that there are stars beyond that. . . That is, strictly speaking, the province of the philosophers, for whom these great invisible lands may exist or not according to their wishes. It is enough for me to have led your mind as far as your eyes can go.33 Fanciful as his style may be, Fontenelle eschewed the fancy of the philosopher. He was constantly at pains to distinguish between metaphysics and science, in- sisting, in the Baconian manner, that experience and not pure reason is the proper basis for the pursuit of science. With the latter conclusions in mind we must turn to another work, the Theorie des tourbillons cartesiens avec des reflexions sur l'attraction, and ask why Fon- tenelle should have persisted in defending the Cartesian vortices sixty-five years after Newton published the Principia Mathematica. It has been suggested that Fontenelle's pride in his earlier work precluded the possibility of accepting Newtonianism.34 There may indeed be some truth in this, but before we pose a psychological explanation, it would be wise to examine and assess the author's own reasons for espousing Descartes. Fontenelle not only fought hard for the Cartesian vortices, but was at pains throughout his life to explain why he did so. The first part of the Theorie is a summary of the principles that lie behind the Cartesian system. It will be remembered that the atomism of the seventeenth century gave rise to two schools of thought. One considered the particle as the last division of matter, so that a space or a vacuum was possible between them. The other school headed by Descartes considered that matter was infinitely divisible, so that an unbroken continuity of matter was the condition of the universe. It is argued that a belief in a plenum derived from two Aristotelian principles, that nature abhorred a vacuum and that objects influence each other only if they are 33 Entretiens 2: 137. 34 Gregoire bases almost his entire discussion of the Theorie des tourbillons on this assumption. See Gregoire, Folntenelle, uine philosophie desabusee, Nancy, 1947. VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959] 19</page><page sequence="20">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE contiguous.35 If this argument is true, it says much about the sources for Descartes's theorizing. At any rate, it is clear that in a universe that is full, locomotion will be by impulsion and not by attraction, and that in a circular system the movements can be attributed to centrifugal force. These are the elements of what Gregoire calls the "Hydrodynamisme" of Descartes, with centrifugal force being Huygens' contribution to the scheme. In the second part of the Theorie Fontenelle offered his argument for centrifugal force as opposed to at- traction, and for the plenum as opposed to space. His argument could not be carried to the heavens for verification, but it could grow out of certain attitudes of thought which are in themselves significant. The first of these is offered immediately. Newton's laws are obscure, unclear, Fontenelle said, telling us not what attraction is, or why it should operate, but only how it operates. "For it [Newton's system] essentially supposes attraction, a principle that is quite obscure and debatable, whereas the Cartesian system is founded on only purely mechanical principles, accepted by every- one." 36 Moreover, the obscurity of the principle of attraction bears a striking resemblance to the scholastic qualities from which philosophy had only recently freed itself.37 Fontenelle specified his objections to it in another passage. If one calls mutual attraction an essential property of bodies although we do not perceive it, we might as well say the same for "sympathies," "horrors," everything that has made the old scholastic philosophy opprobrious. In order to welcome this sort of essential properties, which do not pertain to essences as we understand them, we would have to be overwhelmed with phenomena which were inexplicable without their help, and even then this would not explain them.38 Finally, the mysterious force of attraction meets with another objection, this time a metaphysical one that is by no means inconsistent with Fontenelle's earlier line of reasoning. He said: "This arbitrary admission would ruin the whole philosophic proof of the spirituality of the soul. God might just as well have given thought to matter as attraction." 39 Fontenelle, who persisted 35 H. Butterfield, in The origins of modern science, Oxford, 1950, argues for the Aristotelian background in Descartes's thought. Others have done so, too, notably Professor Gilson. (There is of course the famous scholastic axiom that matter cannot act where it is not, which is relevant to this point.) 36 Theorie des tourbillons cartesiens, avec des reflexions sur l'attraction, (Euvres 2: 273. 37 Others agreed with Fontenelle that action at a distance was no more than the reintroduction of a scholastic quality into physics. Leibnitz called it, "inexplicable, unintelligible, pre- carious, groundless and unexampled. . . . 'Tis a chimerical thing, a scholastic occult quality." From the Works of Samuel Clarke, Leibnitz's fifth paper, 4: 668, London, 1738, as quoted by Mary B. Hesse, Action at a distance in classical physics, Isis 5: 46, 1955. 38 Theorie des tourbillons, CEuvres 2: 276. 39 Ibid., 275. throughout his life in the attempt to separate the phys- ical from the metaphysical, the material from the spir- itual, found it impossible to accept a property of matter that could not be explained. Newton offered no answer to the causal question. It is almost a truism to say that modern science does not answer the question "why," but to Fontenelle more was involved in that question than a search for final causes. He saw the Newtonian argument as an example of circular reasoning, the result contained in the definition of attraction. When we wish to express algebraically or geometrically the active physical forces in the universe, which are neces- sarily interrelated, it is not enough to have made a cal- culation whose result will be infallible, and on which we can surely depend. In order to content ourselves, we must rather understand this result, and know how it is derived.40 There is a strong suspicion here that Fontenelle found the Newtonian universe too mathematical, that is, too abstract, for his taste. It seemed to violate the canons of evidence that called for visible, experimental data. However Descartes may have arrived at his cosmology, the meaning of it for Fontenelle lay in principles of physics which were easily discernible, in a universe that was quite mechanical.41 Centrifugal force had all the virtues of "reality," a reality that seemed, at best to have been excluded from the Newtonian universe. The reader may judge for himself the implications of the following remark. The effects of attraction are always pure and unmixed in the Newtonian system; and as a consequence this sys- tem is incompatible with centrifugal force. However, centrifugal force is quite real, well demonstrated, thor- oughly recognized, even by those who honor other forces.42 Fontenelle did not slight the importance of mathematics, but, like Galileo, thought that it should be an expression of reality, and not a substitute for it. He seems almost to be warning the Newtonians of the fallacy of mis- placed concreteness. Having established to his own satisfaction that the force of attraction is nothing more than a figment of Newton's imagination, Fontenelle went on to attack his notion of space. It follows from Fontenelle's basic assumption that, if matter is infinite, "There is as much matter as space. Everything is full, and the contrived idea of space becomes altogether useless." 43 Because he was unable to conceive of matter without boundaries, 40 Ibid., 277. 41 If Fontenelle rejected the Newtonian synthesis as being no more than a product of the mind, he also rejected the Cartesian methodology for being logico-deductive. It is not surprising that he should have insisted on the primacy of sense data and the comprehensibility of principles of explanation, when we consider the nature of his thoughts on epistemology. Science is indeed a creation of the mind, Fontenelle argued, but the mind's ideas are no more than reflections of elements in our experience. The epistemological question will be discussed in Chapter IV. 42 Theorie des tourbillons, (Euvres 2: 279. 43 Ibid., 283. 20 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="21">CARTESIAN PHYSICS IN FONTENELLE Fontenelle found the vortex the perfect solution to the questions of infinity and divisibility alike. "All our difficulties will be dispersed if we conceive of the infinite mass of matter as divided into an infinity of finite spheres. These are the famous tourbillons of Descartes." 44 Of course these arguments are simply restatements of his initial assumptions. He revealed another one when he said that a universe that is largely void would be deprived of function to the extent of its emptiness, and that God would not have created with this purpose, or lack of it, in mind. This is a Fon- tenellian idea that is already familiar to us, one that assumed the proportions of a law of nature in his mind. Fontenelle was not without his own preferences in metaphysics. His telling arguments, however, were reserved for the void. It was impossible for Fontenelle to understand why two bodies behaving according to Newton's laws should not crash into each other and remain forever un- separated. He insisted then, that in a void, gravitation would pull all matter into one great heap, leaving all of the void on the outside, thereby invalidating the concept. Newton could not have both the void and gravitation. Continuing his argument against the void, he declared that, if centrifugal force is accepted as the cause of motion, then in a void the Cartesian vortices would soon dissipate. Inasmuch as matter has neither dissipated nor cohered, it was quite clear to Fontenelle that the void does not exist, and since the void is necessary to the Newtonian system, then its principles are disproved. It mattered not to Fontenelle that the postulation of a subtle matter to fill the spaces between the vortices was as metaphysical a creation as Newton's "force." What the Fontenellians (and I use this word advisedly) found impossible to accept was the idea of action at a distance. They held throughout the course of the grand quarrel in France to the belief that the force of attraction was at best a mathematical abstraction that bore little relation to mechanical reality, at worst a metaphysical quality similar to the Aristotelian ones that science had banished from philosophy.45 Fontenelle 44Ibid., 284. 45 It is not Descartes's work that is necessarily the basis for Fontenelle's thinking in this matter. If Galileo and others in the great tradition were responsible for mathematizing nature, they also sounded warnings against the idealization of it, or to be more precise, the ascription of teleological purpose to it. The following is Galileo's warning against mistaking names for things, to be found in the Dialogues concerning the two great systems of the world (Salisbury's translation, 1661), Dialogue III. "We [says Simplicius the Aristotelian] confining our- selves to the terms of Art reduce the cause of these and other the like natural effects to Sympathy, which is a certain agree- ment and mutual appetite which ariseth between things that are semblable to one another in qualities; as likewise on the con- trary that hatred and enmity for which other things shun and abhor one another we call antipathy." "And thus [replies Sagredus] with these two words men come to render reasons of a great number of accidents and effects which we see not expressed himself in this manner in the Histoire de l'Academie for the years 1732 and 1733, when the debate between Cartesians and Newtonians was at its most intense. The best statement, however, of the Fontenellian position is given by the unnamed editor (Falconnet?) of the Theorie in his preface to that work. It is so clear on the point of misplaced concreteness, that it would not be amiss to quote it in full. There are, so to say, two different worlds, one mathe- matical, the other physical. The mathematical, which we can also call metaphysical, exists only in the mind of the geometer: it supposes the "infiniment petits," the point without dimension, the line without breadth, the surface without depth, the circle and all the polygonal figures of a perfection only imagined; let us add to that absolute rest, etc. Perfect equilibrium is in this same class, as well as the void, and the gravitation of bodies themselves. All these suppositions are the basis of a calculation, which without it could not be exact, and which without exacti- tude, could not be demonstrated. But none of that is exactly found in nature, no more than the "indiscernables" of Leibnitz; and it is a strange illusion that abuses these abstractions by carrying them over into the physical world as real beings.46 The editor went on to accuse Newton of employing an undefined quality as cause, and then using it in such a manner as to suggest effect. The Newtonians then, "contrast this idealist physics with the Cartesian hypoth- eses," and imagine that they can discredit the real physicists by calling them "Cartesians" as if these physicists adhered to everything that it pleased Des- cartes to imagine.47 Moreover, the Cartesian vortex conformed as readily to mathematical description as the Newtonian system. No, the void cannot be ac- cepted, and gravitation, which the editor recognizes to be an effect but not an essential property of matter, cannot have its cause in space. It must be found in the vortex. For the Newtonians to insist on action at a distance is to submit nature to their ideas, rather than to accommodate their ideas to nature. Gregoire suggests that we call the above attitude "Fontenellianisme" and not Cartesianism, for it did not depend on Descartes's philosophy for sustenance. We without admiration to be produced in nature." Fontenelle was not alien to the Galilean spirit when he asked that reason be confined to generalizing about the particulars that are offered to us by our scientific experience. Moreover, he valued mathe- matics very highly as a means of expression of those generaliza- tions. We shall discuss Fontenelle's understanding of mathe- matics in Chapter V. 46 Theorie des tourbillons, Preface de l'Editeur, (Euvres 2: 182. 47 Of course the Fontenellians misunderstood Newton, who made himself clear on this point in the Opticks. "To tell us that every Species of Things is edow'd with an occult Quality by which it acts and produces manifest effects is to tell us nothing: but to derive two or three general principles of mo- tion from phenomena and afterwards to tell us how the Prop- erties and actions of all corporeal Things follow from those manifest Principles would be a very great step in Philosophy, though the Causes of those Principles were not yet discovered."

We can hardly identify Fontenelle's nominalism, which is so clear in his objections to Newton, with the Cartesian meta- physics, out of which the cosmology grew. Fon- tenelle could follow the example of Descartes in the matter of systematic doubt, but could not be led to that "synthese totalitaire ulterieure," which is one mark of Cartesian thought and perhaps the most character- istic.48 We have seen that the combination of hydro- dynamics and centrifugal force which characterized the vortices seemed to Fontenelle to derive its clarity from mechanics, but that mechanics was as intrinsic to Galilean as to Cartesian physics. That physics lent itself to experimental verification on the one hand, and on the other to a universe that was rationally com- prehensible by virtue of its mechanical unity. To Fon- tenelle the real was indeed rational in the sense that it conformed to universal law, but the rational was not necessarily real, setting off his universe from that of Descartes, which was designed to meet the test of logic. Cartesianism, as such, was unrelated to Fon- tenelle's physics. Although Fontenelle found the force of attraction to be incomprehensible to the rational mind, he was not entirely unsympathetic to the Newtonian cast of thought. The famous Eloge of Newton, which will be discussed in another place, is evidence of the sympathy he felt for the methodology that Newton appended to the Opticks. He contrasted this behavior favorably with the Cartesian variety that leaped immediately to first principles, hoping thereby to deduce all the laws of the universe. Moreover, there is evidence of a high re- gard that Fontenelle had for Newton. In a letter to Newton written in 1714, at the height of the great debate, Fontenelle says, Monsieur. I am requested by the Academie Royale des Sciences to thank you for a collection of various of your works.... I would like to thank you very much on my own account for your new edition of the Principia. .... I could not have merited it except for the admiration that I have for all your works which is shared with everyone who has any interest in geometry . . . and I beg you to be assured that I am, with a marked veneration, Paris, June 9, 1714 Your very humble . ..49 Fontenelle This attitude contrasts sharply with the one Gregoire ascribes to Fontenelle, that of personal pride in the Cartesian vortices arising out of his authorship of the Pluralite des mondes, and personal pique with the New- tonian system for challenging it. 48 The words are Gregoire's. 49 Bonno G., Deux lettres inedites de Fontenelle, Royal So- ciety, MMV 47, 48, Modern Language Notes 54: 1939. See below for Fontenelle's praise of the Opticks. If further proof is needed that anti-Newtonianism in France was Fontenellian rather than Cartesian, we need only point to the fact that the staunchest Cartesians in France were the Malebranchistes, whom Fontenelle attacked in another work that will be discussed later. Even the Cartesian physicists whom Mouy describes rejected the mathematical metaphysics of Descartes, as well as the mathematical pragmatism of Newton's Principia.50 Parenthetically, they were less concerned with astronomy than they were with physics. It is the emphasis upon the latter that links them, together with Fontenelle, to the "mechanical philosophy"; for, as we have seen, what appealed so to the Fontenellians was the "physical explanation" that they were able to give of the universe. By and large the practicing astron- omers in France remained uncommitted to the Cartesian vortices. However, it was precisely in the area of astronomy, that trouble arose for the Fontenellians. Descartes had hesitated to accept Kepler's ellipses,51 but once it was no longer possible to deny them, the anti-Newtonians in France were required to reconcile the tourbillon and the ellipse. The Histoire de l'Academie makes plain that Fontenelle together with others were engaged in this task during the course of some forty years. How is it possible to have an elliptical tourbillon? Easy, re- plied the Fontenellians; the fluid of the tourbillons is in undulation to produce aphelion and perihelion. Be- sides, the pressure of other whirlpools upon our own produces the elliptical orbit. Furthermore, it is perfectly clear that Kepler's first two rules applied to the vortex as well as to the void.52 It is to be guessed that even Fontenelle knew the latter to be a weak argument by the extent to which he repeated it. There was not only the problem of "subtle matter," but also the additional one of spaces between the vortices. If you filled them with little whirlpools, they would be swallowed by the big ones, leaving spaces which, of course, could not be there. Dortous de Mairan and Cassini attempted to explain the action of comets, a problem of some dimension for the Cartesians, 50 Mouy, P., Le developpement de la physique cartesicnne, passim, Paris, 1934. 51 See J. Pelseneer, Gilbert, Bacon, Galileo, Kepler, Harvey et Descartes: leurs relations, Isis 17: 1932. Pelseneer points out that Descartes had very little to do with astronomy, and describes the great philosopher as "aveugle par l'imagination, l'enthousiasme, et un desir tres vif de generalite et de science universelle, meconnaitre completement l'importance veritable de ces lois [Kepler's] si laborieusement acquises et qui consti- tuaient une des plus grandes decouvertes de son siecle." Pelseneer condemns this attitude "de la severite qu'il temoigne a l'egard des Roberval, des Pascal et des Fermat," and said of Descartes that he "usa de metaphores pour decrire le domaine ideal oi il se complaisait; voila sans doute pour- quoi il n'a plus releve les lois de Kepler sur le mouvement des planetes que la loi de Galilee sur la proportionallite de la longueur du pendule au carre de la periode des oscillations." 52 These arguments appeared in the H.A. for the years 1733, 1736, and again in 1741. 22 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="23">PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE by declaring that they were part of an adjacent vortex, never entering our own.53 This was an unsatisfactory explanation, but it was even more difficult for the Fontenellians to explain the action of the tides and the figure of the earth. An additional problem was attacked by Privat de Molieres who went so far as to prove that Newton's mathematics applied exactly to the tour- billon. Fontenelle, commenting upon this in the Histoire said, M. l'Abbe de Molieres preserves, therefore, all of M. Newton's wonderful theory, except that he makes it in some ways less Newtonian by detaching it from attraction and placing it in the plenum. Once fixed in the plenum, the theory has no more need of attraction, and that is not unfortunate for it. 54 But all of these arguments were to no avail. It is precisely at this time, the decade of the thirties, that Maupertuis, Clairaut, Voltaire, and the Abbe Nollet rallied to the support of Newton in France. I do not propose to summarize M. Brunet's admirable book,55 but I should like to point out that the Cartesian vortices which were introduced to the reading public with such eclat in 1686, and which were defended so fiercely in the twenties and thirties, were quite lost to science by 1752 when Fontenelle published the Theorie des tourbillons. They had not been disproved formally, but like so many other hypotheses they had been superseded by having been rendered useless. It must have been a disappointment to Fontenelle that the Cartesian physics had failed to serve as a useful tool for astronomy, but it would be unjust to suppose that he was unwilling to accept a more fruitful hypothesis when it appeared. Fontenelle was nothing if not disinterested where science was concerned. It was in behalf of science that Fontenelle opposed at- traction to the very end. The great debate in France turned not on the names of Newton and Descartes, but on the interpretation of a philosophical point which 53 Fontenelle praised Cassini for his Cartesian explanation of comets. "Une grande objection, et des plus redoutables contre les tourbillons cartesiens, est que l'on voit des cometes qui se meuvent contre la direction du mouvement de ces tour- billons. M. Cassini a fait voir en 1730, par l'exemple d'une comete qu'il observa, qu'elles pourraient, aussi bien que les planetes, paraitre quelquefois se mouvoir contre le tourbillon, ou etre retrogrades, sans cesser jamais d'etre directes. Par la le vide Newtonien serait detruit et le plein cartesien retabli. M. Cassini a montre en 1735 que les rotations des corps celestes, forts differentes a ce qu'il parait de la premiere loi de Kepler, s'y peuvent ramener. Enfin, il montre ici l'accord des deux lois de Kepler sur un point ou leur opposition semblait manifeste. II ne doit point etre question ici de M. l'Abbe de Molieres dont nous avons souvent parle a l'occasion de tout ce qu'il a fait ou pour defendre ou pour affermir le systeme car- tesien; mais, autant qu'on peut juger d'un avenir auquel les accidents de la fortune ont moins de part qu'a tout autre, la fin de la guerre pourrait etre avantageuse a ce systeme." H. A. 1736: 132-133. 54Ibid., 1733, 131. 55 Brunet, P., L'Introduction des theories de Newton en France au XVIIIe siecle, avant 1738, Paris, 1931. insists that science is indeed the creation of the human mind, but that it must bear a close correspond- ence to nature. This belief is supported by the fact that the Newtonian method was accepted in France long before the physics. The Opticks was translated and known before the Principia and, as we have already noted, Fontenelle made known his appreciation of the method in his Eloge of Newton.56 Like Newton, Fontenelle probed the metaphysical foundations of science,57 but he would not subscribe to the Newtonian philosophy of "as if." The mechanical philosophy freed him from this obligation, for it offered a de- scription of the universe which, in its clarity as dis- tinct from exactitude, also served as explanation, and provided understanding as well as knowledge. Sug- gestive as this is of the Cartesian criterion of logic, it is by no means the same thing. Both sides in the debate assumed, of course, an order in the universe which would find its expression in law. Fontenelle wanted to be reasonably sure that whatever law was announced was in fact an expression of nature and not simply an extension of human logic. This problem in varying degrees and guises has been central to the philosophy of science ever since. IV. PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE: THE ATTACK ON METAPHYSICS I Although Fontenelle disclaimed the Cartesian label in his defense of the tourbillons, his divergence from Descartes shows up more clearly in his attack on metaphysics. His insistence on separating both the physical and biological sciences from dependence upon God as explanation has already been noted, but when he freed the working of the mind from any meta- physical connection, he made a more crucial departure from Descartes. His search for law was one that would admit no deus ex machina, but would find law within nature: self-contained, self-operative, and self- consistent. The flight from metaphysics, as common among French scientists as among the English, was tacit admission that science could not be pursued by any literal adherence to Descartes's philosophy, to say nothing of his method. However, Fontenelle was one of the first to oppose Cartesianism consistently in this regard, and in so doing, to formulate the tenets of the 56 Eloge de Newton, GEuvres 7: 279. "Une utilite de ce livre [Newton's Opticks], aussi grande peut-etre que celle qu'on tire du grand nombre de connaissances nouvelles dont il est plein, est qu'il fournit un excellent modele de l'art de se conduire dans la philosophie experimentale." It is clear that Fontenelle's sympathies lay with the experimental method, and that he considered experiment lacking in Newton's synthesis. 57 See A. Koyre, From the closed world to the infinite uni- verse, Baltimore, 1957. 23 VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959]</page><page sequence="24">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE scientific naturalism that played so lively a part in the science of the Enlightenment.' Fontenelle's explicit break with Cartesianism came as early as 1686, the very year in which he published the Entretiens, in a work entitled Doutes sur le systeme physique des causes occasionelles which struck at the foundations of Cartesian causality. Fontenelle made it quite clear at the outset that he considered the Oc- casionalism of Malebranche to be the direct descendant of Cartesian duality and the idea of external motive force.2 Then Descartes realized that one cannot conceive how the movement from one body passes into another, and always with the proportions observed most exactly. He already was possessed of occasional causes which owed their existence to his conception of the soul; he saw that by applying them to bodies, he had put an end to the dif- ficulty: he made bodies, then, the simple occasional causes of the communication of movement from one to another since one found it impossible to establish the liaison be- tween the movement of a body and that of a second, struck by the first, nor how the movement of the first passed into the second; and he wanted God to be the true cause, who, on the occasion of choc, transported movement from one into the other: for one always sees a necessary connection between the will of God and its effect. Such was the growth of occasional causes in physics: they possessed physics altogether under Descartes. Le Pere Malebranche arrived . . . and transferred them to theology.3 Although Fontenelle never abandoned the principle of impulsion as motive force, his way out of the difficulty was to view it, not as a force external to matter, but rather as one that was inherent in matter, that was a quality of matter in motion. He argued that bodies are their own true causes for their movements, because a true cause is one in which a necessary connection is seen between it and its effect, whereas "an occasional cause is one which does nothing precisely because it is, or may be such and such, but because when it is, or is such and such, a 'true' cause acts in such a way that between the occasional cause and its effect you see no necessary connection." 4 Fontenelle charged that a metaphysical causal agent had been introduced, which is no less mysterious than the physical one. He was content to view choc as a true cause and effect re- lationship by finding necessary connection in matter itself. 1 See A. Vartanian, Diderot and Descartes, Princeton, 1953. As already noted, Professor Vartanian marks this flight from metaphysics and describes in admirable detail the creation of scientific naturalism in France, but views it as the outcome of Cartesian philosophy. 2 Fontenelle was not the only one to have held Descartes directly responsible for occasionalism. Bayle did so as well in the Nouvelles de la republique des lettres, March 1686, and again in April 1686: 426, when he said, "M. Gadrois bon Cartesien a dejSa montre qu'il n'y a point de systeme plus favorable a l'astrologie que celui de M. Descartes ..." 3 Doutes, ?Euvres 8: 23. 4Ibid., 26. This of course is a piece of circular reasoning of which Fontenelle seemed unaware. Of course the foregoing argument begs the question, but what Fontenelle sought was an explanation in mechanics which would free physics from dependence on God. There was no need to bring God into the question, just as there was no need to rely on attraction when the manifest laws of physics were utilized. But Fontenelle first attacked Malebranche on theological grounds. When the latter said that movement is existence, and that God alone can give existence, doubtless he was involved in a semantic error that allowed him to confuse the word "give" with the word "determine." What Malebranche really meant to say, declared Fontenelle, is that God Himself determines movement; and even this is an indefensible position on theological grounds, for, if bodies cannot move each other, then immobility is essential to them. That idea runs counter to the necessary omnipotence of God, who must surely be able to impart motion to matter. Once this is admitted, a natural cause will be entirely satisfactory for it allows us to see why a thing happens, not necessarily how, which is no less than one can say about God as cause, but has the further advantage of doing without Him in science. Even so the argument is really a metaphysical one, but important in that it is designed to define God's proper relationship to the world of nature, an activity that was common in Fon- tenelle's time and that commanded the attention of many leading figures, including Newton himself. Fontenelle argued that the Cartesians who insisted upon the simplicity of nature were really confounding God and His works. They failed to note two things: that nature in its fullness is not at all simple, but that God does act in the simplest way possible. To elaborate this, Fontenelle declared that the real design of the world is not simplicity, but workability, and that God had provided for simplicity in His laws of nature which, presumably, is what allows that quality to appear as an ingredient of scientific explanation. It should be remembered that he made this same point in the Entretiens when he said that the magnificence is to be found in the design of the world and that economy is the principle of its execution. Furthermore, what is a proper definition implicit in Fontenelle's argument is that of "Law of Nature" requires that law be sought within nature, thereby designating a general law of nature. In chapter five of the Doutes, Fontenelle asked how intelligence operates when fashioning an object. By relating the purpose of the design to the nature of the object, he answered. Consider a watch. It is an object the parts of which are arranged to sound the hours, or it is a mechanism that sounds once, and then requires a hand to sound them again, or it is dis- regarded altogether, and the hours are sounded by cracking two blocks together. All of these methods of keeping time conform to the principle of uniformity, but only the first is perfect in that it conforms to intelligence as well. God, of course, must have created 24 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="25">PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE with intelligence. When He imparted motion to the universe, He did so according to law, a general law that would execute the design according to the nature of the object, so that the object would require by itself what the design required, that is, it would fulfill the design for self-operation. It is clear that Fontenelle could not and did not want to avoid the metaphysical argument of his time, but it is, after all, a matter of the plainest common sense, he maintained, that God would not have created a world in a constant state of chaos, that could not func- tion by general law. Uniformity implies only the constant continuation of the same relationship, whatever it may be, between action and subject. Generality, if we may call it that, disposes this relationship to be as perfect as possible. This con- fusion fills the works of the Cartesians from one end to the other.5 Is the quarrel between those who would be constitu- tionally disposed to emphasize the omnipotence of God, and those who would stress His omniscience? If so, Fontenelle was in the latter camp in believing that God had designed the world to do without His intervention. He traced the causal difficulty to Descartes, whose failure to arrive at the pragmatic monism that was his own position, led ultimately from the Cartesian separa- tion of mind and matter to the denial of natural causality. Does his scheme, Fontenelle asked, accord any less respect to God than that of the Cartesians ? Not at all. God was still the prime mover in his system, but in all other respects it was different and more useful. The implication is present that when occasionalism, or metaphysics, is cast aside, it is possible to get on with the business of science, the measuring and generalizing about the behavior of bodies. (Fontenelle was to attack the accepted notion of causality with another kind of occasionalism, the Humean variety, but that was to be in the area of psychology and not of theology.) The effort to separate science from metaphysics was de- signed at the beginning of the century to forestall the opposition of the Church; at the end of it, Fontenelle, like Newton, waged his campaign against the Cartesians. II Fontenelle opposed still another principle of the Cartesians in the famous quarrel about animal autom- atism which commanded attention in the Academy and which was an important aspect of the larger debate concerning the philosophy of science. Although in re- gard to this debate, Fontenelle could accept the Cartesian vortices on the principle of simplicity of explanation, that same principle prevented him from considering the animal a machine. He had seen too many dissections to fail to appreciate the complexity of a living form. Moreover, the Cartesians had settled upon the doctrine 5 Ibid., 55. Fontenelle clearly argued for God as intelligence, whose desire for uniformity was expressed by law. of animal automatism out of theological necessity, so that it is not surprising that Fontenelle should have discountenanced it. Not the principle of mechanical simplicity, but that of a uniform and general law of nature seemed to operate for Fontenelle in the biological sciences. Many critics have failed to perceive this, just as they have been misled by his seeming mechanism as revealed in the following statement. "Everybody knows that as the arteries are the canals for the blood, so the nerves are the canals for the 'spirits' necessary to all movements of the machine animale." 6 What does he mean by "la machine animale?" There are of course parts of the body which we know behave me- chanically. Fontenelle decided that the bodies of both men and animals are machine-like, but he declared that they do not function mechanically. Although he readily admitted that the actual manner in which bodies func- tion remained a mystery to him, he nonetheless argued that the existence of a mystery should not dispose us to accept the most convenient explanation. This question of animal behavior is enlarged upon in his discussion of instinct. Fontenelle defined instinct, in his fragment on that subject, as essentially a low variety of thought, and since both men and animals possess instinct, then both can be said to think. Instinct is not something that is superimposed on reason, Fontenelle declared, nor is it an involuntary mechanical action of the body, but "It is a voluntary movement produced by my soul, similar to that of walking." 7 For example, it knows that it wants to keep a body from falling, but not that it needs to put out an arm. What we call instinct, then, is no more than the first mechanical response to a need of the soul, necessarily the correct response, that is made habitual. Of course this argument begs the question; we would consider it a contradiction in terms to say that it takes a thought or recognition of danger to react instinctively. Nevertheless, Fontenelle was willing to acknowledge that there was a variety of behavior which was shared by men and animals, in- dicating a difference in degree and not of kind between them. This is illustrated by his comment on Reaumur's work. "There is a certain quantity of intelligence spread among the animals of our globe, men receiving without comparison the most considerable in the division. . . .Of that which remained the insects have had the largest share." 8 Fontenelle believed that instinct partakes of universal reason (it should be classified as talent, how- ever, and not intelligence, or esprit), so that if in- stinctual behavior depended on thought in the case of men, it must do so in the case of animals. If the latter think, that is one more reason for refusing to consider them machines. There were differences between men and animals which Fontenelle recognized as important, that of 6H.A., 1727: 7. 7 Sur l'instinct, (Euvres 5: 411. 8H.A., 1737: 9. VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959] 25</page><page sequence="26">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE language for example, but what is significant is that he chose to stress the similarities between the two. One further point should be noted. Sharing with Con- dillac a tendency toward voluntarism that reversed the Cartesian formula: the will is founded on the idea, Fontenelle considered intelligent behavior, whether of man or the animal, to depend ultimately upon the will. The implication is clear from this that ideas at their source are based upon the needs of the body; the pleas- ure-pain principle may be discerned in the fragment on instinct. The idea of the closeness of men and animals was not alien to French thought. It was given its loosest formulation by Montaigne in the Apologie de Raimond Sebonde,9 but, as it is offered to us by Fontenelle, the idea bears a closer resemblance to the voluntarism or vitalism of Leibnitz who exercised a considerable in- fluence upon the perpetual secretary.10 The principle of a general law of nature required that all living forms be self-regulating. Accordingly, the vitalist point of view was in direct contradiction to the Cartesian duality that required mind to be the prerogative of man (for theological reasons), and then was constrained to define animals as machines. Fontenelle's biographer, the Abbe Trublet, said very much the same thing in 1757 when, commenting upon the Doutes, he had occasion to discuss Fontenelle's anti-Cartesianism. But he has always appeared to me to be quite removed from this system, as far from it as he was from animal automatism. . . . He found the words of M. de la Motte as correct as they were clever, that the idea of animal automatism was a debauchery of reasoning. Indeed, these words make it quite clear that Descartes, and after him, le Pere Malebranche, were led into it by a chain of con- sequences flowing from their metaphysical principles." 11 Unlike Descartes, Fontenelle would have us look di- rectly at nature; one had only to observe a dog to know that it suffered pain, despite the Abbe Male- branche's deduction to the contrary. There remains one further argument against animal automatism which may have been crucial for Fontenelle. According to Fontenelle, generation and reproduction seemed to be the distinguishing features of all living forms. That animals are not machines becomes perfectly clear just as soon as it is realized that no machine ever reproduced itself. The debates about generation took a sharp edge in the Academy because of their ideological overtones, 9 See Montaigne, L'Apologie de Raimond Sebonde. 10 To the extent that Fontenelle is in the literary tradition of La Fontaine, he would be expected to take a less rationalist attitude to animals. Indeed, at certain points in his Lettres Galantes, he ascribes qualities of intelligence to animals that is suggestive of La Fontaine's depiction of them. The influence of Leibnitz upon Fontenelle will be reserved for a later chapter, but it should be noted here that the number of times that Fontenelle talks of a "life force" in the history of the Academy leaves no doubt that he was a vitalist so far as the biological sciences are concerned. 11 AMmoires a servir, 114. preformationism having the sanction of the Church because of its teleological character and closeness to the Biblical account of creation, whereas its opponents saw in epigenesis an argument for the self-sufficiency of nature. The doctrine of preformation was extended by believers in emboltement, who saw all individuals in each species, contained one within the other as in a nest of boxes. This group was soon split between those who saw the nest in the. egg, and those who argued for the sperm. Although Fontenelle did not enter very deeply into the debate, perhaps because of its con- troversial nature, it is more than likely that he was disposed to favor epigenesis. His belief that every creature originates in the egg, does not tell us much, but his hint that all animals derive ultimately from common matter is more significant.12 The universal law of nature would then preclude a special creation even for man. "One sees that the law of generation of animals is quite constant, and nature is always the same, in the large as well as the small." 13 The whole picture of generation may have been as yet unclear to the eighteenth century, but Fontenelle chose to believe that further research would reveal its naturalistic foundation. One serious question about generation remained to plague him: How are we to explain the existence of freaks, or monsters, as they were called in the eighteenth century. This, too, was the subject of a lively debate in the Academy. Fontenelle was unwilling to see the hand of God in the production of monsters, and so he was forced to conclude that they were the result of an accident of nature which God chose not to correct. How this belief could be reconciled with the general law of nature, or God's omniscience, was never made clear. However, Fontenelle preferred to take his chances with accident, rather than yield to those who considered the monster to be either a special creation of God or a faulty piece produced by a mechanical nature. Here, too, Fontenelle awaited the outcome of further research, which he was sure would reveal the law behind apparent disorder. It was in the biological sciences, then, that the debate over ideology was most vital in the eighteenth century. The first half of it produced a wealth of observation as well as speculation, and this is not surprising, even apart from ideological considerations, when we consider that a rather large proportion of the members of the Acad- emy were physicians and naturalists of one kind or another, and that the history of the Academy is filled with accounts of their investigations.'4 Our relative 12 De l'Existence de Dieu, and especially the H.A., 1701. 13 H.A., 1718: 11. 14 Nineteen out of seventy, or nearly thirty per cent of those academicians who died between 1699 and 1733, were naturalists or physicians with an interest in botany, anatomy or other natural sciences. Some excellent investigators were to be found among that number, notably Tournefort, Mery, Bourdelin, Du Verney, Geoffroy, Ruysch, and Chirac. 26 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="27">PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE inattention to this area may be explained by the fact that those who concerned themselves with the natural sciences were, as a rule, lesser figures, or simply less well known, than the astronomers and physicists; more- over, the state of their sciences forced them to work with much fewer data than their more renowned col- leagues. Fontenelle found that his argument for a uniform and general law of nature met its greatest resistance, quite naturally, in the biological sciences, and he found his greatest opportunity to contest author- ity in the matter of creation and evolution. His thoughts on this subject are among his most daring for he not only challenged the Biblical account of creation, but spoke for an evolutionist philosophy that should trace even man back to a prime living substance. Fontenelle did not hesitate to make known his opinions, saying in a letter to Pere Castel in 1728 that, "I hardly agree with you about the constancy of nature, that is, the fixity of the present form or constitution of the universe. Movement is a necessary principle of change, and the future is quite long." 15 However, he declared even earlier, in an article that is strikingly modern in its implications, that the water had once covered the entire earth, causing rock strata to be horizontal, and that the first life upon it must have been marine life.16 If it is argued that the precedence of water upon the earth simply follows the order of crea- tion in the Bible, we must not fail to consider the above statement in conjunction with Fontenelle's little work called De l'Existence de Dieu. In his argument for a Creator who stood apart from his work, the author said: . . .when the earth was formed, inasmuch as it was filled with active, lively atoms, filled with the same subtle mat- ter of which the stars had just been formed, in a word, young and vigorous, it might have been fertile enough to give birth to all the different species of animals.17 Common matter then was far from being inert; rather it was possessed of a vitality ultimately derived from the Deity, but that served by itself to explain all phenomena. It is not said how some of it developed into living forms and why the rest of it did not, but we may assume that this was part of the mystery of creation that it is impossible for man to fathom. The subject of initial creation was left to religion to explain as the wonderful thing that it was.18 However, all of nature was greeted by Fontenelle with wonder and reverence, for creation did not cease at a single moment, but is a constant process. Why should it be expected that matter would 15 Lettre au Pere Castel, 7 avril, 1728, (Euvres 8: 377. 16H.A., 1716: 161. 17 De l'Existence de Dieu 3: 232. 18 Fontenelle believed that there were limits to scientific knowledge that would prevent humanity from ever knowing those things that religion usually claims for its own. In his eloge of Ruysch he declared, "Un premier voile qui couvrait l'Isis des Egyptiens a ete enleve depuis un temps; un second, si l'on veut, l'est aussi de nos jours; un troisieme ne le sera pas, s'il est le dernier." lose its vigor, and with the same amount of it always present is there not every reason to expect a constant creation of forms, perhaps even new ones, or permuta- tions and combinations of the old ones? . . . For the earth has always the same quantity of cor- puscles or atoms suitable to forming animals, and its fer- tility, far from being lost, ought in no way to diminish. What is an animal formed of? of an infinity of corpuscles which were scattered in the grass he has eaten, in the water he has drunk, in the air he has breathed; he is a composite whose parts were brought together from a thousand different places in this world; these atoms cir- culate constantly, forming now a plant, now an animal, and after having formed one it is no less possible for them to form another. Therefore, there are not any atoms of a particular nature which produce animals; there is only indifferent matter, from which all things are successively formed, and which clearly never diminishes, since it always supplies everything equally.19 Although Fontenelle declared that God stands behind the creation of animals, which are part of his design for use, his strongest argument is reserved for Gas- sendist matter which produced men and animals alike as a result of a creative force which God had implanted in matter. Therefore, nature is the truly marvelous for Fon- tenelle. One has no need of the false marvels, the prodigies of nature that ignorant people are so fond of discovering. It seemed that Fontenelle almost worshipped nature, and not God. And why not, he may have argued. Doesn't nature work by itself, ac- complishing feats of self-regulation, displaying untold richness of invention ? The imagination is staggered by its complexity and its exactitude, by its balance and its harmony of parts. Having its own symbols, form, and structure, nature is analogous to a work of art and speaks to us as art does. A study of comparative anatomy may reveal the analogy to us. Nothing is more advantageous for anatomy than the com- parison of different species. Often a part invisible in one species becomes visible in another; .... Finally . . . we see with astonishment all the different structures which nature has devised in accordance with the elements in which they live, the climates they inhabit . . . the functions for which they are destined: . . . and we lose ourselves in pleasurable contemplation of this prodigious mechanical apparatus, of this infinite variety of combinations and of so many exact proportions of means to their different ends.20 Although this passage is strongly suggestive of finalism, the teleology is much more evolutionist than it is Thomistic. The means-end relationship which is de- scribed appears to have no purpose beyond its own 19 De l'Existence de Dieu, cEuvres 3: 235. 20 H.A., 1670: 117.

It is no surprise that God is perfect, but that nature should be is truly wonderful. Fontenelle's pleasure is carried further when he turns from the animal world to that of the insects. What dissection reveals is hardly to be compared to the world that the microscope has to offer to the eye. It has been seen that Fontenelle was willing to share universal reason with the insects. Perhaps his willing- ness to do so is a result, in part, of the genuine stupefac- tion that he felt upon recognition of the complexity of sub-microscopic forms. He gave expression to his wonder on numerous occasions in the Histoire de I'Acadetmie. Man must have been astonished when he saw animals as small as a worm or mite for the first time; especially if he had a good idea of what their structure must be, and of what a prodigious number of infinitely smaller mechanisms such a small mechanism was composed of.... What are the limits to the smallness of animals? Our eyes carry us from the elephant to the mite; there a new order begins, reserved for the microscope, which goes from the mite to animals twenty-seven million times smaller. This order is not exhausted if the microscope has not yet arrived at its greatest perfection.21 Professor Lovejoy suggests that it is this kind of joyousness in the fecundity of nature that lies at the heart of eighteenth-century optimism about the world. Fontenelle shared in that attitude, revealing none of that pessimistic feeling, sometimes expressed in our own century, that humans are being crowded for the available space by the untold numbers of insects. The individual forms, both large and small, may be impressive, but the balance between them that exists in nature is a further source of wonder. In a burst of optimistic enthusiasm, Fontenelle declared that not even the depredations of man could permanently upset the ecological order. Should the caterpillars be exterminated, on what would the worms live who feed on them? When these worms are dead or greatly diminished in number, on what would the birds feed . . . who depend on them for food? And since these make up a part, and the most pleasant one, of our own nourishment, would not the loss be noticeable? But apparently this misfortune does not menace us .... Nature has known how to calculate; she has mixed quite well the advantages and disadvantages, losses and re- sources, and she has not forgotten to include us ourselves in the reckoning.22 Nature has not only provided for harmony between its parts, but it has the capacity to restore that balance when it is upset. Fontenelle seems to have come close to equating this capacity with thought, thus making an identification of "life" with "thought" that is almost the equivalent of nineteenth-century romanticism. Fon- tenelle's complete faith in the processes of nature is 21H.A., 1718: 11. 22H.A., 1736: 31. revealed when he said that, "Nature knows how to correct her apparent oversights, if however, one can say that she has been negligent in her work, and if these are not rather different ways of doing the same thing which reveal a greater richness of invention." 23 Nature can do no wrong. Where nature seems to fail, the failure can be traced to our lack of comprehension. It may not be invalid to compare this attitude with the earlier theological one that commanded the same kind of faith, but (Carl Becker's arguments notwithstanding) it is by no means unimportant that the object to which the faith is directed has changed. Although both religion and science look for the intelligible behind appearances, it is a matter of some significance that the interest has shifted from God to nature. Fontenelle may have come close to deifying nature, but he did affirm the existence of the Deity in the grand scheme of things; and this is proof of the sincerity of his belief in a Creator. If nature is self-operative in accordance with the principle of fecundity that God implanted within matter, and therefore removed from its creator, then the order we find in nature stems rather more directly from the unity of design that was God's plan. Furthermore, it is not only the existence of nature that bespeaks the intelligence of its creator, but, with the new knowledge available to man, one could say that the behavior and complexity of its parts do so as well. We discover nothing new in nature without discover- ing at the same time several suggestions of the wisdom of its author. From the time we discovered that leaves drew nourishment for plants, we saw that He who made them thin and flat wanted them to have more surface area in order to draw more nourishment.24 While it is true that Fontenelle described the Deity in other terms in the Pluralite des mondes, i.e. the watchmaker who gave movement to astronomical im- mensity, this definition is not really at variance with the one that emphasized His intelligence. As a matter of fact, we have seen in the Doutes that it is on the basis of God's intelligence that Fontenelle denied Occasional- ism and defined universal law, and it is on this basis that the biological world ultimately rests. When Fon- tenelle wrote De l'Existence de Dieu, it was not the metaphysical proof that he offered, nor the one from the movement of matter, but the fact of the existence of man, who could not have been produced fortuitously and then gone on to generate, which proved to him the existence of God. Although Fontenelle believed in God, it cannot be over-emphasized that he wished to delineate very clearly between the behavior of God, who is of course om- nipotent, and that of nature, which reveals His om- niscience. Fontenelle's motive in doing so was not to detract from God who was the object of worship in 23 H.A., 1672: 154. 24H.A., 1668: 60. 28 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="29">PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE matters of faith and morals, but to give the study of nature its proper value. On some occasions, Fon- tenelle implied that God created the world and all its forms, on others, that He simply created the matter from which all the rest flowed. However much was effected by the initial act of creation, once the moment had passed, nature continued to operate, to correct itself, even to create anew without any further assistance from Providence. This is the only correct way to view both God and nature, Fontenelle argued. Nature must be construed as functioning according to its own laws of behavior; God must be worshipped as its author, not as an anthropomorphic being who feels called upon to meddle with it. Therefore, if Fontenelle offered God the full measure of his admiration, it was no less important to him to accord equal measure to His work. Indeed the world of nature can be said to possess all the marks that are His, and so to become a legitimate object of reverence, set off from the traditional preserves of faith and morals. Moreover, God is ultimately unknowable to the human mind, whereas His work is within the boundaries of human comprehension. It becomes the obligation then, almost the religious obligation, of the enlightened man to persist in the investigation of God's handiwork. That handiwork is God's miracle, and the only one that Fon- tenelle, and presumably God, was willing to acknowl- edge. All the others derived from man's ignorance, superstition, credulity, and capacity for fraud. The readiness with which men believe in the falsely marvel- ous attests to the vulgarity of most, who are unable to appreciate the truly marvelous to be found in nature. The sense of appreciation that Fontenelle manifested toward nature may lie at the very heart of his feelings about it. It was not simply with intelligence, meth- odology, and information that he met nature, but with a sensitivity to its aesthetic possibilities. The mass of people is not without intelligence, and, if its ignorance can be corrected, nonetheless the majority of individuals may be without sensitivity, or, what amounts to the same thing, opportunity to cultivate it. This may ex- plain why Fontenelle felt that the majority was in- capable of the pursuit of science. It is quite clear that Fontenelle considered the naturalist in every sense an aesthetician, for the work that he is contemplating and studying, speaks to him not only of beauty, but of form and structure, and of means and ends. Moreover, the study of nature seeks comprehension as well as ap- prehension, and therefore involves the naturalist in criticism and valuation. Of course the scientist is not to be compared to the painter or sculptor who fashions a work of art, but neither is he to be compared simply to the viewer who shares with the scientist the aesthetic pleasure to be derived from art and nature. The aesthetic level of the scientist, Fontenelle implied, is that of a critic, who is engaged in a creative process of investigation, whose object is to illumine the mind about the work of art in which we live. Therefore, the aesthetic note that we detect in Fontenelle's thought is not to be viewed as an accompaniment to science, but as an essential component of it, furnishing the scientist with a motive for love beyond that of the pure quest for knowledge. III Fontenelle considered man as well as nature to be a union, not a duality, of mind and matter. He did so for two reasons. First, he preferred to make no dis- tinction between man and the world of nature of which man was an integral part; second, he thought that he had discovered why the mind and body should be related. Fontenelle was not a materialist. That matter and the ultimate product of mind were quite dissimilar, he acknowledged, but he did not believe that this prevented them from standing in a special relation to each other. If we do not know exactly how that relationship is effected, we are not constrained thereby to deny it. Fontenelle's consideration of the psychological-epis- temological problem is contained in a series of frag- ments that are notable for their freshness and originality in a time when nearly every philosopher was obliged to discuss it. The first thing that strikes us upon reading the documents is Fontenelle's departure from Descartes in the matter of innate ideas. He states very early in the Connoissance de l'esprit humain that all ideas, even the most generalized and sublime, stem from experience, that is, from the senses. What Descartes considered to be an innate idea, the mathematical axiom, is no less a creature of experience than the proposition that all men are mortal. Some people pretend that axioms, that is, propositions which are incontestably true, are innate ideas. I reply that these two axioms: the whole is greater than any of its parts, and, all men are mortal, are equally derived from experience, but they are not equally dependent upon repeated experience for verification.25 The real difference between the two propositions lies in the fact that nature shows the first one to us in its entirety, so that the first experience that we have of it convinces us of its necessary correctness.26 The confusion about the origin of the mathematical axiom arises from the fact that we have no further need to test or prove it. Inasmuch as this idea, although derived from experience, persists in my mind by itself, independent of succeeding experiences, I believed that experience never supplied me with it; I have misconstrued its origin, and persuaded myself that I was born with it. That is what is called a natural axiom.27 So far Fontenelle would agree with Locke that the self-evident truths of mathematics, although endowed 25 De la Connoissance de l'esprit humain, CEuvres 5: 398. 26 Ibid., 398. "The same necessity which makes a thing such, also becomes for us an absolute necessity to conceive of it as such." 27 Ibid., 400. VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959] 29</page><page sequence="30">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE with a greater certainty than those arrived at by in- duction, have their source in the same kind of ex- perience as the latter. The second kind of knowledge, exemplified by the proposition that man is mortal, obviously requires that we be witness to the death of more than a few men, making its origin in experience quite clear. Convinced that the senses are the source of all knowledge, Fontenelle was led to deny specifically the "clear and distinct idea" of Descartes and, with it, the entire Cartesian ontology. He did this in two ways: first, by positing the real existence of matter, that is known by its secondary as well as its primary qualities, and second, by insisting that even our notion of the infinite is derived from our experience with the finite. Employing an argument ostensibly designed to up- hold the existence of the soul by distinguishing it from matter, Fontenelle declared that it was incumbent upon us to make judgments about the secondary qualities. It is true, he stated in the Loi de la pensee that the secondary qualities do not provide us with the degree of certainty made available to us by the primary qual- ities, but this in itself is no reason for banishing them from matter. We must decide either that whiteness is in matter or in the mind. It will not do to say that there is something in the object that makes me think of white. That statement simply begs the question of whiteness, for either the quality helps to assure you of the object or it does not. Furthermore, if one says there is something in the object that makes me think of white, then the same terminology can be used with respect to the primary qualities, and the outcome of this line of reasoning would be Pyrrhonist and impertinent. But if one should be able to say, "there is something in the object which makes me think, etc.," the same thing could be said about movement, shape, position as could be said about color. . . . Now, a man who will say that there is something in objects which gives him the idea of movement, shape, extension, will be a complete pyr- rhonist, and the most impertinent ever alive; you will never prove to him the distinction between the body and the soul, since it is only founded on the supposition that there is nothing in matter but extension, movement, etc.28 The impertinence of this position consisted for Fonte- nelle in the supposition that the mind of man could hold all of the ideas that are contained in the universe. Even supposing that these ideas came directly from God, this state of mind would be a duplication of God's mind, and thereby a usurpation of His function. Furthermore, to confuse mind with matter would be to diminish the im- portance of the soul which owes its significance to its pure, non-material character. The objective reality of matter must be distinguished, although not necessarily separated, from mind if the latter is to be saved for theology. It was with a bow to theology as well as to Descartes that Fontenelle set out to undermine both. 28 Loi de la pensee, (:Euvres 5: 393. In the same logical vein, he carried this argument even further to insist that the existence of God cannot be proved unless we assume complete objective existence. If we were to say that we have an idea of whiteness that is not derived directly from matter, then we would ask, "Where does the idea come from ?" Like Bishop Berke- ley, we would have to answer that the idea comes from God, but what will positively assure me of the existence of God, Fontenelle asks. His reply is quickly given. "Take away all my sense ideas and you will never prove to me the existence of God. Therefore we must return to a positive belief in some of the things reported by the senses." 29 This is not only a logical argument against the Pyrrhonist position, but manifests a keen observa- tional sense as well. Moreover, it is significant that Fontenelle's observational sense should have led him to retain the secondary qualities within matter when Locke himself had failed to do so. One cannot help surmising that this positivist frame of mind, more sophisticated but somewhat similar to the Baconian view of things, was beginning to find its proper role in science after the cen- tury of abstraction that was necessary for the New- tonian synthesis. Fontenelle's "positivism" led him finally to define the infinite in terms of the finite whose limits have been lifted.30 He offered two examples to demonstrate the behavior of the mind with respect to this problem. First, let us consider that we take more drops from the sea than we put back, and that the sea will gradually diminish, and second, that we put as many back as we take out. No idea of infinity attaches itself to the second situation, but it is impossible to think of the first one without sensing the character of it. Of course we are unable to explain its infinity, but we are aware that such is its distinguishing feature. It is in this fashion that Fontenelle conceived of infinity. We have a capacity to suppose the finitely large without understanding it. We have that same capacity to imagine the infinitely large. We neither understand it, nor perceive it. But we understand something about finitude which, according to supposition, ought to be part of infinity; and that is how we imagine we see a beginning to infinity, what we call perceiving it.31 One suspects that this mode of thinking was suggested to Fontenelle by the nature and behavior of the calculus. In addition, this method of arriving at the infinite, and by inference, God, runs parallel to Fontenelle's argu- ment for the real existence of matter. It is clear that, as a point of departure, the senses, on the one hand, and the clear and distinct idea, on the other, lead in different directions, and that Fontenelle might have considered that the Cartesian proposition of "Je pense, donc je 29 Ibid., 392. 30 De la Connoissance de l'esprit humain, CEuvres 5: 395. 31 Ibid., 411. 30 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="31">PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE suis," did no more than state the very thing that was in question. With this as our basis we can examine what is per- haps one of the most interesting of Fontenelle's frag- ments, the Traite sur la raison humaine (c.a. 1720). Returning to the epistemological question, once again Fontenelle undertook to explain some of the ideas that we have already considered. He states at the outset that it is not logic or logical reasoning with which he is con- cerned at this time, but that other variety of reasoning which operates in the area of verifiable fact. What is that kind of reason? Fontenelle has decided that it consists in idea formation, but the ideas in themselves represent nothing; they give an assurance of probability only. If we see one animal move, that fact tells us nothing. If we see two or three animals move, then the idea is formed that all animals move. However, "all animals," as such, is not a thing that exists. In insisting that the universal is based on the particular, Fontenelle has thus far simply restated the nominalist position. With great boldness, Fontenelle went on to assert that God Himself is a nominalist. It is in the very nature of His excellence that he sees only particulars, but all of them together and at once. He has no need to form universals as man does. (The animals are aware of only specific particulars.) Man's mind is able to gen- eralize on the basis of specific experiences, but the uni- versals that he creates do not offer him pure under- standing, or even any absolute certainty. Only God has that because he is free of the need to generalize.32 The language that man creates, even individual words, is of the order of generalization. The word meaning "house" comes to stand as a symbol for the thing designated. We meditate in words, Fontenelle argued; we may even write poetry which gives the words a separate existence, but we do not say that the symbol is the thing in itself. It simply stands in a special relationship to the object. This is made clear by the fact that each language has a different word for the very same object, but, "reasoning on the same things in various countries, is the same because, although based on words which are different, words are merely substi- tutes for the ideas of things, which are the same." 33 The primacy of things and not ideas is demonstrated by the fact that painters, and even the deaf and dumb, develop an "esprit plus vif" that operates directly on things without the necessity to mediate between mind and matter with words. By now it is clear that Fontenelle defined knowledge 32 In the Traite sur la raison humaine, Fontenelle says, "Dieu n'a pas d'idees universelles, son entendement infini embrasse distinctement tous les particuliers ensemble et n'a pas besoin d'en faire d'extraits ni d'abreges. D'ailleurs il ne peut avoir d'idees qui ne representent rien de reel. Or une idee univer- selle ne peut rien de reel et par consequent ne represente rien du tout." To what extent this idea derived from Leibnitz should be an interesting subject for further investigation. 33 Ibid. 5: 379. not in terms of Locke's tripartite division of certainty, but, like Hume, in terms of the mathematical and the empirical experience. Even here the distinction is blurred, for we have seen that Fontenelle insisted that the mathematical axiom took its point of departure from experience, although of a special kind that suggests the idea all at once and in its entirety. Once we have come by such an axiom we are assured of it by the fact that we feel it impossible to conceive of it other- wise.34 It is always possible "to conceive otherwise" when nature shows us only a part of herself. That is why we have axioms in mathematics, but so few in any other area of investigation. Furthermore, we must be careful to recognize that the mathematical belief, based as it is on experience, may ultimately have to be corrected, and it can only be corrected by another such empirical belief. Like Hume then, or Leibnitz, Fontenelle asserts that the non-mathematical sciences provide us with a lesser degree of certainty because it is always possible to conceive of the event otherwise. It is not illogical to say, for example, that the sun will not rise tomorrow. The implication is present in Fontenelle that the belief we have in causality is based on nothing more than our awareness of the customary conjunction of events. This represents a departure from Fontenelle's belief in real causes as expressed some thirty years before in the Doutes, but it seems to follow as a corollary to his idea of the limited nature of experience and to his extreme nominalism. If A is said to be the cause of B, Fontenelle argued, we must recognize the possibility that one day B will not follow upon the appearance of A; and if this is the case, might not the idea of causality itself be an abstraction that may rest on nothing more firm than our experience with the constant conjunction of A and B. Although the latter idea is present by implication only, the conclusion is inescapable that Fon- tenelle's thought was directed into precisely the same channels that Hume's thought was to follow some twenty years later. However, the spirit that informed Fontenelle was considerably more optimistic than the one that plagued the Scotsman. Fontenelle never lost his faith in empir- ical science. If, in contrast to Descartes, he was un- willing to dismiss sense data as being simply a source of error, he was equally unwilling to suggest that our lack of assurance in science perhaps invalidated its claims. He viewed science as a progressive activity that gradually brought us closer to the truth. "These false judgments stemming from the senses, are subsequently corrected by others which the same general law in- duces. Thus it supplies of itself the remedy for the disorder it has caused." 35 Science has the capacity to correct itself. Moreover, if the truth that science makes available is less than absolute, there is no 34Ibid., 382. 35 Loi de la pensee, (Euvres 5: 386. 31 VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959]</page><page sequence="32">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE reason why we cannot be satisfied with that state of things; it is unnecessary for us to require more than a limited certainty. Indeed, perhaps the very idea of certainty needs to be redefined in the light of our scientific activity. "Finally, these judgments are true, not in themselves, but in connection with our needs for which they suffice." 36 This is as early a statement of scientific pragmatism as the author has been able to find, and as hopeful, in total context, as the eighteenth century was to produce. The freshness and originality of Fontenelle's empir- icism should help revise the accepted belief in the English monopoly of empiricism, and correct the notion that the French were simply parroting the English after the fact when they did express themselves on the sub- ject. Moreover, Fontenelle was not the only one to be thinking in this vein. A little known, but excellent treatise, called in English First Truths and the Origin of our Opinions Explained, was published by Pere Buffier in 1724, just a few years after Fontenelle wrote his fragment on the subject. Pere Buffier adopted a common sense empiricism that is probabilist in its implications. He too denied the existence of uni- versals, even such hallowed ones as justice, and declared that they offer us no more assurance than a probability that is based on the particular experiences from which they spring. There is no escape for man from his uncertainty. Indeed, "The most natural and general use of probability is, to supply the place of truth." 37 This is true of mathematics as it is of everything else, for mathematics is founded on definition which, as Pascal pointed out, neither demonstrates the true nature of things, nor explains them. As a "positivist" Pere Buffier insisted that our real knowledge is derived from the world of substances. What we take to be ideal knowledge is no more than the interrelationship of ideas in our minds. He was quite explicit, however, about the need to cast out of our minds the Cartesian doubt, and what we might call the Humean doubt. Our scientific knowledge makes it possible for us to assent tentatively to a series of propositions that offer the hope of ever-expanding knowledge. The examples of Fontenelle and Pere Buffier should 36Ibid., 391. 37 Le Pere Buffier, First truths and the origin of our opinions explained, translated from the French, 121, London, 1780. I am indebted to Professor Henry Guerlac of Cornell University for making known to me the existence of this work. See also N. Freret, Reflexions sur l etude des anciennes histoires, et sur le degri de certitude de leurs preuves (1724), (Euvres completes 1: Paris, 1796, for further evidence of the pragmatic attitude in France. Part of Freret's argument consists of an attack on those who wished to apply the canons of geometry to other fields. He points out that "the most important sciences to man, ethics, politics, economics, medicine, criticism, jurisprudence, [history implied], are incapable of this identical certainty of the geometric demonstrations; they each have their separate dialectique . . .," 145-146. These sciences are capable, how- ever, of yielding different degrees of certainty or probability which does not diminish their usefulness. serve to indicate that even at the height of the Cartesian- Newtonian controversy in France the real issue had nothing to do with empiricism versus rationalism. Re- serving the question of methodology for the next chapter, it can be said now with assurance that Fon- tenelle was not only a critical empiricist at an early date, but that he managed to avoid the pitfalls of subjective relativism and Pyrrhonism as well. Matter had a real existence, and no distinction is to be made among its qualities. In this regard Fontenelle is close to Bacon, who insisted on retaining all of the qualities within matter, with this difference however: Fontenelle expressed this principle at a time when the natural sciences were sufficiently developed to make fruitful use of it. Not only is matter real, and to be taken in all its concreteness, but it can be understood in that fashion, and understood sufficiently well to provide us with a real comprehension of its character and behavior. Fontenelle was quite convinced of the beneficent order- liness of nature, of its susceptibility to scientific ex- planation, in short, of man's identity with nature in mind and body. There was no question in his mind about whether the principle of order was in man's mind or in nature. It was to be found in both places, be- cause the one was intimately connected with the other. If this looks very much like the Christian view of the world, it should be remembered that Fontenelle's monism was naturalistic and pragmatic in character. Although the question of priority has some im- portance, Fontenelle's discussion of the epistemological question finds its true meaning in the fact that reason had ceased to serve as the basis of being, if indeed French science had ever accepted the Cartesian ontology, and had been newly defined as an agency of mind, motivated by emotion. The way was paved for ex- plaining being on the basis of becoming, and not the other way around. Fontenelle's cosmological thought has demonstrated the value, if not the validity, of his search for a principle of unity. His speculations and conclusion about the behavior of living forms has demonstrated the need science had for a principle of generality. To what extent Maupertuis and, through him, Leibnitz influenced French thought in this direc- tion I am not prepared to say. It is sufficient for our purpose to point out that both the vitalism and nom- inalism that are apparent in Fontenelle's thought were essential ingredients of a revived natural science. Iatro- physics notwithstanding, the principles of the physical sciences had only a limited application to living forms, and Fontenelle was well aware of that fact. Yet some one principle, God or nature perhaps, had to bind the two worlds together. We have tried to emphasize in the previous chapter the principle of the unity of nature that constituted for Fontenelle the law of nature. In this chapter we have defined "law within nature" in terms of the principle of generality that should be uniform throughout nature, and we have discussed Fontenelle's view of mind as an agency of man in 32 [TRANS.

THE METHODOLOGY OF SCIENCE I The existence of an empirical tradition in France, as revealed in the activity of the early scientists, directly challenges the belief that the French were indebted to the English for the subtleties and refinements of the empirical method.' However, the impression persists that Fontenelle remained a Cartesian rationalist to the end of his days, in opposition to those who declared for the Newtonian method.2 Perhaps the skillful use of a critical rationalism in his social science, or his de- fense of a mechanical model of the universe, is the basis for such a belief, although this point of view over- looks the fact that Fontenelle's adherence to the me- chanical model was because of its experiential character and the possibility it offered of employing a critical empiricism. Such being the case, there is only one other criticism that is suggested, that Fontenelle mis- understood the importance or role of mathematics in seventeenth-century science; his too close allegiance to the tourbillons or to a nominalist position in science may have prevented him from comprehending math- ematics as an idealized means of expression for science.- An analysis of Fontenelle's understanding of method, necessarily linked to the matter of science, should start therefore with a discussion of his thought on math- ematics. How he viewed the relationship between the matter, mathematics and method of science to a large extent expressed the character of science in his time. Although we know that Fontenelle was not entirely an amateur at science, having undertaken serious study with some of the academicians,3 it has been the judg- ment of some critics that his knowledge in this area was never more than superficial.4 Fontenelle himself admitted to mistakes in the history of the Academy.5 1 See H. Brown, Scientific organizations in seventeenth- century France, Baltimore, 1934. 2 Carre's book does not depart from the image of Fontenelle as a Cartesian rationalist, and although Gregoire notes Fon- tenelle's empiricism, he slights the latter's concern for method- ology which I take to be central to a discussion of his phi- losophy of science. 3 We know that Fontenelle met regularly with Du Hamel, Du Verney, de La Hire, and Tournefort at the home of Varignon in the years 1686-1688, and appears to have studied botany with Tournefort, medicine with Homberg, chemistry with Lemery, and anatomy with Du Verney. See Trublet, Memoires pour servir, passim. 4 Bertrand has said that "Fontenelle ne fut jamais fort savant . . .," declaring that the academician had little real knowledge of science, but only an understanding of its general character. J. L. F. Bertrand, L'Academie des Sciences et les academiciens de 1666 a 1793, 208, Paris, 1869. 5 Trublet records a conversation with Fontenelle as follows: "Lorsque je lui parlai d'une reimpression separement des memoires, il me dit, et il me l'a repete depuis qu'il pouvait y However, it is hardly to be expected that he would show a perfect understanding of all the branches of science then extant, despite the greater unity of the disciplines and the serious interest shown in all of them by the educated of the time. Unspecialized as he was, never- theless Fontenelle possessed a working knowledge of mathematics and physics, so that he was at least within the limits of his competence when he undertook to define their character. In his Preface de l'histoire de l'Academie, Fontenelle said that, "the reign of words and terms is passed; we want things; we establish principles which we under- stand, and we pursue them." 6 This well-known pas- sage has often been cited to emphasize Fontenelle's retreat from authority and return to nature, but it should also be noted that he spoke of principes. It comes as no surprise to his reader that his principles of explanation in science were mathematical. While mathematics by itself tells us nothing about the world, physics is no science at all without geometry. Geometry has almost no use if it is not applied to physics; and physics has substance only to the extent that it is founded on geometry. The subtle speculations of one must find a body, so to speak, by allying with the experiments of the other; and experiments which are naturally limited to particular cases, must assume universality and change into principles by means of speculation. . . . The greatest physicists of our century, Galileo, Descartes, Gassendi, Father Fabry, have also been great geometers; and without doubt one of the principal reasons why physics has been prevented for so long from producing anything but terms is that we have separated it from geometry.7 Fontenelle could not be accused, as Bacon was, of having overlooked the importance of mathematics. On the contrary, he extended its usefulness to make nearly every kind of learning susceptible to its beneficent order: The geometric spirit is not so attached to geometry that it cannot be extracted from it and transferred to other branches of knowledge. A work of ethics, politics, criticism, perhaps even of eloquence will be much better, other things being equal, if it is done by the hand of a geometer.8 These oft-quoted lines have been cited as evidence of the Cartesian spirit in France, although the passion for regularity and order was so general a characteristic of the France of Louis XIV that it hardly seems possible to ascribe a single source for it. The selection of geometry as the mathematical model is, of course, a truer reflection of Cartesianism, and altogether predict- able in view of Fontenelle's allegiance to the mechanical avoir dans cette Histoire des meprises et des fautes qu'il faudrait faire corriger par quelque habile homme, si on la reimprimait; il m'indiqua MM. de Mairan et de la Condamine; des fautes, ajouta-t-il, qui ne venaient que de lui-meme et non des memoires dont il faisait l'extrait; des fautes qui lui etaient personnelles, etc. . . .," Trublet, Mercure de France, juin, 1757. 6 Fontenelle, Preface de l'histoire de l'Academie des Sciences depuis 1666 jusqu'en 1699, (Euvres 6: 2. 7Ibid. 6: 18. 8 Preface de l'utilite de mathematiques, 1708, (Euvres 6: 67.

We are not required, however, to depend on statements of this kind to assess his understanding of mathematics. In addition to a small essay on the number 9,9 which was not without merit, Fontenelle wrote two more on the calculus which were intended to clarify that subject for his contemporaries. At the time that Fontenelle wrote the Preface des ele'mens de la geomcetrie de l'infini, 1727, there was some confusion as to whether the concept of math- ematical infinity bore any relation to the metaphysical one. Fontenelle explained that some took the idea for pure supposition that enabled the geometer to solve problems, after which the "infinite" was discarded as so much scaffolding. "That is a less severe way of thinking, which protects us a little from the fright which the infinite always causes." 10 However, in this and another work, Fontenelle made it quite clear that the idea of infinity, although intellectual and logical in character, was no less real than any other scientific hypothesis concerning finite order. It would be too childish to say that one of these spaces may actually be traced, and that the other may not .... Geometry is completely intellectual, independent of actual description, and of the existence of forms whose properties it discovers. Everything that it conceives of as necessary is as real as the reality it supposes in its object. The in- finity that it demonstrates is therefore as real as the finite, and the idea that it has of it is no more a supposition to be discarded after use than any other is. ... Therefore, infinity is number, and ought to be treated as such, which is further proof of its reality.1- This passage indicates Fontenelle's appreciation of the idealist character of mathematics and its importance to science for that reason. If number comprises the skeletal structure of nature, then it should serve as the means of expression for science. Fontenelle was careful, however, to distinguish be- tween the metaphysical and the mathematical concep- tions of infinity, not for the benefit of theology, but for the future of science. In a long paragraph reminiscent of his discussions on epistemology, he analyzed the kind of evidence open to mathematics, and the nature of its certainty. But if certainty is entire, it seems that the evidence is not; for example, an infinity less than another appears always to contain a contradiction. This smaller infinity is necessarily limited by its relationship to the larger, and just as soon as it is limited, it is no longer infinite; but we must be careful that this apparent contradiction does not spring from an idea of infinity other than the one we are considering. We have naturally a certain idea of the infinite as a "grandeur" without limits in every sense, which includes everything, outside of which there is nothing. We may call this infinity metaphysical; but geometrical infinity, 9 Question arithmetique sur le nombre neuf, Nouvelles de la republique des lettres, Sept. 1685. 10 Preface des elemens de la geomtetrie de linfini, (Euvres 6: 44. 11 Ibid., 45. that is, the one geometry uses and needs in its researches, is quite different; it is simply a magnitude that is larger than any magnitude. It is clear that this definition allows for infinities larger or smaller than other infinities, and that the metaphysical one does not so allow. Therefore we have no right to draw objections from metaphysical infinity against the geometrical kind which is responsible only for what it contains and not for what pertains to the other. I could say more: metaphysical infinity cannot be applied either to number or to extension; it is the product of pure reason, and the misinterpretation of it serves only to trouble and confuse us.12 This is clearly a pragmatic redefinition of infinity, with more than an implication that the traditional conception of it is useless, if not dangerous to peace and clear thinking. If such a tool as the calculus is useful to the sciences, it ought not to be forgotten that it is itself on one level of abstraction, and that its usefulness, even its truth, depends on its link to physics. Fontenelle was very well aware of the limitations of mathematics when he said that "there is in geometry only what we have put there; only the clearest ideas that the human mind can form about magnitude." 13 Even our very clearest ideas, Fontenelle went on to say, may not help us to penetrate to the "intimate nature of bodies." Nevertheless, these same ideas are not metaphysical, so that properly used they could serve as the tool of description, perhaps even of explanation in science. Mathematics was the language of science, the shorthand or language of metaphor, a necessary complement to experiment's language of analysis. Fontenelle's understanding of this placed him in the company of Galileo and Newton, and his ex- planation of this idea was welcomed as a worth-while contribution to scientific thought. 'S Gravesande, writing to Fontenelle in 1730 about the Preface, said: The new ideas about infinity, that you have included in the different volumes of the history of the Academy, have astonished the greatest mathematicians. You have brought together all these different views, clarified and developed them; you have joined to them a great number of others which have not yet appeared, and concerning subjects which no one has dared touch till now. Finally you have devised a system which cannot fail to be received by connoisseurs as a gift that surpasses their expectations, although they know whose hand did it. . . . reading it has given me too much pleasure to keep from expressing my appreciation.14 The Preface enhanced Fontenelle's reputation for seri- ous thought at a time when his earlier gallantries had already been forgotten and his contemporaries had come to respect his pronouncements about science. Fontenelle's analysis of the role of mathematics in science should serve as an excellent introduction to the question of method, for whether or not French science was Cartesian throughout Fontenelle's lifetime should 12Ibid., 47. 13 Preface de l'analyse des infiniments petits du Marquis de l'H6pital, 1696, (Euvres 1: 43. 14 As quoted in Trublet, op. cit., 295. 34 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="35">THE METHODOLOGY OF SCIENCE be decided by how it viewed the relationship between mathematics and methodology. When Fontenelle said in the Preface just discussed that certainty in higher math- ematics had been achieved at the expense of clarity,15 he would have seemed to Descartes to have distin- guished unnecessarily between the terms. However, Fontenelle believed that it was its certainty, not to be found in nature, that made mathematics no more than a tool of science. Clarity or understanding was the goal of one's research into nature, not the logical condition for it. These distinctions were central to the question of method which may have outranked in importance the related debate over ideology. II Although Fontenelle recognized the need for math- ematics as an aid to discovery (the secrets of nature were unlocked by that key), he never held with Descartes that the process of discovery was itself math- ematical in character. Such a mode of procedure he considered to be no more than an exercise in logic, fruitless of results, productive of metaphysical specula- tion only, and of closed system; not even the appeals of certainty and clarity held any fascination for him. It can be said with justice, that the latter qualities, so heavily emphasized by Descartes, were a consequence of a mathematical methodology that Fontenelle condemned even when he was being most polite. It is not my purpose to conduct an investigation into the philosophy of Descartes, but simply to refer to certain judgments of it that have been made by succes- sive critics, in order to point up Fontenelle's departure from it. There is no doubt that Descartes spoke about the importance of observation and experiment, especially in the Regulae, and that he was often less Cartesian than those who professed his principles, but it is also perfectly clear that he considered all sense perception to be a source of obscurity, incapable of providing a basis for scientific knowledge. Indeed, such a basis was to be found only in certain innate ideas that were clear and distinct. Two simple points may be noted here: that the closest thing to an "innate idea" is the mathematical axiom, and that starting with such an axiom, the usual course of activity is to spin out its consequences. Descartes himself said in a letter to Mersenne, speaking of Desargues, "He knows very well that my entire physics is nothing else but ge- ometry." 16 Pierre Boutroux, contrasting Mersenne's science, which he characterized as a mathematical de- scription of physical effects, with Descartes's interest in cause, asked, "What, indeed, is a mathematical physics for Descartes? It is a physics where all phenomena appear as mathematically necessary con- 15 Preface des elemens de la geometrie de l'infini, op. cit., 50, quoted below. 16 Descartes, Letter to Mersenne, 27 juillet, 1638, (Euvres 2: 268, Paris, 1897-1913. sequences of a small number of simple principles con- cerning the shapes and displacement of bodies." 17 Charles Adam has said the same thing in a slightly different fashion. "Inasmuch as the essence of ma- terial things is extension, the chief science, the one which dominates all the others, which none can surpass and on which all depend is mathematics. For him [Descartes] all of physics is no more than math- ematics." 18 It is one thing to use mathematics as a vehicle of expression, another to make it the substance of one's science. Some of the implications of the latter course for methodology are perfectly clear. If Galilean mechanics can be described as a kind of problem-solving that has a strong empirical foundation, then it is clear that Galileo's mode of thought was alien to Descartes. Indeed, the Frenchman took issue with Galileo when he commented on the Discorsi in 1638: I find in general that he philosophizes much better than the vulgar in that he abandons the scholastic errors as much as he can and tries to examine physical matters in accordance with mathematical principles. To that extent I am in complete agreement with him, and I believe that there is no other way to find the truth. But it seems to me that he is weak in that he is continually digressing and never stops to explain a matter completely, which proves that he has never examined them in order and that without having considered the first causes of nature, he has only sought reasons for several particular effects, and thus he has built without foundation.19 It was impossible for Descartes to resolve any question of physics without having first explained all of his principles.20 In his analysis of the Discourse de la methode, Professor Brunschvicq suggests that those principles were a matter of faith for Descartes, and that only in the realm of pure mathematics, and not in science, is it possible to conduct an investigation in this fashion.21 The Cartesian formula that requires 17 Boutroux, P., Le Pere Mersenne et Galilee, Scientia 31: 359, 1922. 18 Adam, C., Descartes, Les trois notions fondamentales, Revue Philosophique, 7, mai-aofit, 1937. 19 Descartes, 27 octobre, 1638, op. cit. 2: 380. 20 "II m'est impossible de resoudre absolument aucune ques- tion de physique qu'appres avoir explique tous mes principes," 14 aofit, 1634, ibid. 1: 303. And on the mechanics of Galileo, "Ie puis seulement dire que ny Galilee, ny aucun autre ne peut rien determiner touchant cela [the fall of weights] qui soit clair et demonstratif, s'il ne s?ait premierement ce que c'est que la pesanteur, et qu'il n'ait les vrais principes de la physique," 22 juin, 1637, ibid. 1: 389. 21 Brunschvicq, L., Note sur I'epistemologie cartesienne, Revue Philosophique, 31-32, 1937. Professor Brunschvicq has this to say about the second and third rules of the Discours, that require us to uncover the simple and then to proceed from the simple to the more complex. "L'evidence, c'est l'absence de doute, le repos apres l'inquietude, mais effet de fatigue autant peut-etre que signe d'apaisement." And about the fourth rule: "Qui nous garantira contre le peche d'omission alors que, precisement, avant d'etre en droit de dire que nous n'oublions rien, il nous faudrait tout savoir deja, et savoir ce qui est tout." And finally: "Dans le domaine des mathematiques pures les regles semblent s'appliquer d'elles-memes. En effet, les 'dif- 35 VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959]</page><page sequence="36">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE us to proceed from the simple idea to the more complex, would seem to reverse the procedure that has been common to the empirical sciences since their inception. With the possible exception of the astronomers, Descartes found critics in his century as well as our own. Descartes's disdain, even neglect, of Galileo, was not seconded by his contemporaries, who considered the Galilean mechanics, and not the Cartesian variety, to be the model of empirical science. Mersenne, Gassendi, Huygens, and Leibnitz were some of the major figures who condemned the Cartesian methodology.22 Leibnitz summed up that criticism when he said with marvelous clarity: The best method for the mathematical intelligence in this universe is not at all that which in certain elementary cases is the easiest to apply; for this very same facility with which nature seduces the philosopher, paralyses the savant in the presence of complex problems which reality can never fail to pose. Even when reality appears to be simple, it is ready to disclose complexity, the immense subtlety which is so characteristic of it. Basic principles are no longer predetermined, closed forms, destined to crystallize the scientific system, but they are springs to action, tools for the unlimited extension of positive knowl- edge.23 Without doing more than reminding ourselves of such criticism, we may note one further fact. Even the Cartesian physicists, Regis and Rohault, departed from the master's methods to the extent of citing Gassendi and Pascal as their mentors in this area.24 One could not hope for a surer indication of the disregard gen- erally accorded to Descartes's mathematical method. ficultes' sont denombrees a l'avance puisque l'homme invente d'abord le probleme dont il se propose de chercher la solution. D'autre part, il n'est pas ici en face d'une nature qui impose, ou tout ou moins qui implique, un ordre a elle." This judg- ment points up the distinction that has sometimes been made between Galileo, the physicist who expressed himself in mathe- matics, and Descartes, the mathematician who turned his talents to nature. 22 Pierre Boutroux has written about this as follows: "II est manifeste que les savants, les mathematiciens, exception faite pour les specialistes de l'astronomie, dont Mersenne n'etait pas, admirent par dessus tout, dans l'ceuvre de Galilee, les theories mecaniques, qui leur paraissent plus nouvelles, plus originales que tout le reste. De ces mathematiciens (Roberval, Fermat, Gassendi, Frenicle, Le Tenneur, Florimond de Beaune) Mersenne exprime sans doute exactement la pensee, car il se declare sans cesse d'accord avec eux. Or Mersenne, dans ses ecrits proprement scientifiques, se prononce en termes tres clairs et categoriques; ce qui determine son enthousiasme c'est l'accord que Galilee a su realiser entre l'experience et l'expres- sion mathematique des faits mecaniques." Le Pere Mersenne et Galilee, Scientia 31: 357, 1922. See also Harcourt Brown, op. cit. 23 Leibnitz, Les Etapes de la philosophic mathematique, des wuvres mathematiques, Gerhardt, ed., 7: 206-208, as quoted by Brunschvicq, op. cit., 34. This is close to being a statement of Fontenelle's own position with respect to method, and indeed Fontenelle praised Leibnitz's method in his eloge of the German philosopher. 24 See Paul Mouy, Le Developpement de la physique car- tesienne 165, 126, Paris, 1934. Professor Gilson has argued for the scholastic roots of Cartesian thought; indeed I am willing to accord to Descartes the honor of having created a new scholasti- cism which the passage of four hundred years made difficult for the later age to accept. In his insistence upon intuitive understanding, upon essence and not existence, upon demonstrative and not critical reason, he was perhaps more at home in the realm of meta- physics than in the world of science. It can be reason- ably argued that scientific truth was for Descartes a consequence of God's will and not of human intelligence, and that his system as a whole rendered more of a service to theology than it did to science. The theo- logical implication of Cartesianism was not lost on Malebranche as I have suggested elsewhere, nor was it lost on the Cambridge Platonists. Charles Adam has stated that ". . . The principal object of this metaphysics is to serve religion." 25 Descartes doubted in order to arrive at a clear and distinct idea that was certain, but it is only in God that one can find absolute certainty. It was this kind of certainty that Fon- tenelle considered unnecessary to the pursuit of science. Furthermore, Fontenelle believed that the quest for it would involve the scientist in metaphysics, which was wasteful when it diverted him from science, and harm- ful when it seduced him into closed systems of thought. Remembering Fontenelle's definition of scientific cer- tainty as being something less than absolute, his ap- preciation of the limited role of mathematics is made clear in the following quotation: . . A strange thing has happened in higher mathematics; certainty has obscured clarity. We always hold to the thread of a calculation, an infallible guide; it does not matter where we arrive; we must arrive somewhere, whatever obscurity we find at the end. Moreover, the glory has always attached to the large research problems, to the solution of difficult problems, and not to the clarifica- tion of ideas.26 In this passage Fontenelle seems to have placed himself on the side of Galileo, whose habit of problem-solving offered more by way of science at the same time that it claimed less for it.27 Fontenelle's clearest exposition of the two modes of thought is to be found in the famous comparison be- tween Descartes and Newton, that figured in the eloge of the latter genius. Its importance to our discussion will be my excuse for rendering it in full: Both were geniuses of the first order, born to dominate other minds, and to found empires. Being excellent geometers, both saw the necessity of attaching geometry 25 Adam, C., Descartes, op. cit., 4. Of course the Cartesian system was not without benefit to science, but in its essentials it had more of the spirit of the past than it did of the future, as I have hoped to show. 26 Preface des elemens de la geometrie de linfini, (Euvres 6: 50. 27 Of course, Galileo's science was not without its rationalistic element, but it was his experimental philosophy that impressed the seventeenth century. 36 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="37">THE METHODOLOGY OF SCIENCE to physics. Both founded their physics on a geometry that they all but invented themselves. But one, soaring boldly, wished to place himself at the source of every- thing, to render himself master of first principles by means of several clear, fundamental ideas, in order that he might simply descend to the phenomena of nature as so many necessary consequences. The other, more timid or modest, began his journey by depending on phenomena in order to climb to unknown principles, resolved to admit them, whatever the chain of consequences might produce. One began with what he understood early in order to find the cause of what he saw; the other began with what he saw in order to find its cause, be it clear or obscure. The self-evident principles of the first did not always lead him to phenomena such as they are; phenomena did not always lead the second to principles that are sufficiently evident. The limitations of these two contrary methods which have halted two men of this kind are not the limita- tions of their particular minds, but those that are common to humanity.28 This quotation appears to raise Descartes and Newton to equal eminence with the choice of method left to the reader, but for all that he admired Descartes, and sided with the Frenchman in the matter of attraction, it will become clear from our discussion that Fontenelle favored the Newtonian method of discovery. The words "observation and experiment" have been used so often in connection with science that one hesi- tates to undertake another discussion of them. How- ever, everything depends on the meaning that we attach to the words, so that an examination of Fonte- nelle's understanding of these activities is without doubt central to our discussion. The call for observation that Fontenelle sounded throughout his lifetime was pred- icated not so much on the hope of revealing the causes of phenomena, as on the need for recognizing the effects. The simple facts of nature must be determined before we can hope for anything else. Fontenelle's praise of the members of the Academy was often for their exacti- tude of observation, and for their attention to the facts. To cite but one among many of the Eloges, Mery was congratulated for his predisposition, "to bring an ex- treme exactitude to observation and to assure himself of the simple truth of things. He did not force himself to consider the why of such and such disposition, struc- ture, . . . . 29 The observation and classification of facts will often suggest a law of nature, especially in the natural sciences, where mathematics may be ignored altogether. Like d'Alembert Fontenelle recognized that not all the sciences were equally susceptible to math- ematical generalization.30 28 Eloge de Newton, (Euvres 7: 275. 29Eloge de Mery, (Euvres 7: 139. 30 H.A., 1730: 43. It was the growth of the natural sciences in the early part of the eighteenth century that suggested a limit to the use of mathematics. D'Alembert, in the Traite de l'equilibre du mouvement des fluides, recognized that not all the different branches of physics were equally susceptible to the application of mathematics, and Buffon seems to have wanted to limit the use of mathematics, to optics and astronomy only. See Maury, L'Ancienne Academie des Sciences, 99, Paris, 1864. Fontenelle argued in the Entretiens that God showed his magnificence in the design of the world, but that economy is the principle of its execution. Nature is not simple, but its laws are. These circumstances make ex- periments necessary, and offer a clue as to their conduct. The laws of choc are very simple but in all the effects that they offer to our eyes, they are so enveloped and choked by a multitude of different circumstances that it is difficult to discern them, and to come to see them in their natural simplicity. The secret is first to strip away as many circumstances as possible, and to entertain only the cases where they enter the least.31 Obvious as this path may be, there are still pitfalls that may be unavoidable. Fontenelle praised Newton in his capacity as experimenter, and, finally had this to say on the subject. The art of conducting experiments carried to a certain degree is by no means common. The least part which is offered to our eyes is complicated by so many others which compose or modify it, that one cannot, without great skill, discern everything which is a part of it, nor, even without great sagacity, suspect all that may enter into it. We must break down the fact in question into others which are themselves complex; and sometimes if one has not chosen his path well, he will lose himself in a labyrinth from which he will never emerge. The primitive, ele- mentary facts seem to have been hidden from us by nature with as much care as the causes; and when we come to see them, it is an entirely new and unforseen spectacle.32 The experimental method is admittedly difficult and un- certain, but there is no other way to go about discover- ing scientific truth. Intuition may help us to seize the truth at the final moment, and logic may help us to demonstrate it, but brute fact must be faced first of all by the mind and hand. Fontenelle signaled his choice of method when he analyzed the elements of the calculus, describing how first a number of small truths are dis- covered in geometry, and after that, . . . We see how they are related, and the general prin- ciples begin to appear. . . . Several small branches, grasped separately at first, lead to the large branch which pro- duced them; and several large branches lead finally to the trunk. One of the greatest difficulties which I experienced in the composition of this work was to seize the trunk, and several large branches appeared to be the trunk, when they were not.33 He introduced the first principles of the calculus at the beginning of the Preface, he explained, because the method of exposition reverses the order of discovery. This fact sheds light on the character of truth in science, as well as on the method of attaining it. "The truth is simple and clear; and when our manner of arriving at it is difficult and obscure, we can say that it leads to the truth, but is not true." 34 If Fontenelle disagreed with 31 H.A., 1706; 156. 32 Eloge de Newton, (Euvres 7: 276. 33 Preface des elemens de la geometrie de l'infini, (Euvres 6: 53. 34 Ibid., 53.

On the contrary, he expressed disap- proval of it when he said of Du Hamel: People reproached him for being unsympathetic to the great Descartes, so worthy of respect from all philosophers. . . . He entered into questions of a general nature re- gretfully. . . . His inclination and his knowledge always recalled him quite promptly to the experimental phi- losophy.36 Fontenelle's emphasis upon the positive fact was due not only to his empiricism, but, as I have already sug- gested, to his suspicion of systems in science, Cartesian as well as others. He has told us of his own freedom from affiliation, and he always praised others for being equally free.37 What was more important, however, was that the Academy should have decided to adhere to this principle. Up till now the Academy of Science took nature only in small doses. No general system, to avoid the inconven- ience of hastily contrived systems, with which the im- patience of the human mind accords only too well. Once they are established, they block any truths which may follow. Today we make sure of one fact, tomorrow, another which has no connection with it. We do not leave off guessing about causes, but we are only guessing.38 Fontenelle held that it had been the rule of the Academy since its inception to resist moving too quickly from fact to generality. The truth of the fact must be ascertained first, and there was no better way of doing so than by submitting it to a group of equals who would be careful to scrutinize each other's work. Al- though Fontenelle did not subscribe to the idea of group work in science, he obviously recognized the importance of learned bodies as a means of checking results in addition to transmitting them.39 was an active participant in the controversy and the respect accorded his pronouncements is the measure of his importance to the discussion.

And in his Eloge of Claude Perrault, he said: "Tout grand physicien qu'il etoit, il n'etoit nullement en- tete de la physique, et il ne regardoit ses propres systemes que comme des probabilites qui etoient a la verite, le sujet le plus raisonnable sur lequel l'esprit humain pfit s'exercer, mais qui ne meritoient pas une creance entiere," (Euvres 7: 542. 38 H.A., 1699: 19. 39 Commenting on Claude Perrault's Memoires pour servir a l'histoire naturelle des animaux, in the Histoire de l'Academie, Pref., VII, Fontenelle said: "Car ils ne sont point le travail d'un particulier, qui peut se laisser prevenir de sa propre opinion. .. . Ces inconvenients ne peuvent se rencontrer en nos 'Memoires,' qui ne contiennent point de faits qui n'aient ete We have already seen that Fontenelle's experimental- ism was the obverse of his distrust for metaphysics. He sounded his warning against it nowhere more clearly than in the Traite de la raison humaine. Identifying the procedure of logic with that of metaphysics, he went on to say, What we commonly call logic has always appeared to me to be a most imperfect art; you learn nothing from it about human reason, the means it uses in its research, or about the limits God has prescribed for it ... logic is nothing but vain, useless research ... 40 We know that Fontenelle believed in God, whose ex- istence was proved by the very existence of nature. It would not be unfair to Descartes to say that he started from the opposite end of things, inferring the existence of God from the behavior of the mind, and then explaining nature according to the character of the Deity. Fontenelle disdained this procedure. Con- ceiving of mind as an agency of nature, he believed that it could provide us with only an imperfect knowl- edge of God. Therefore, it should be directed entirely to nature where truths may be found that are in- complete, but more certain. This capacity to be satisfied with less than absolute certainty marks an important turn in French scientific thought, for it makes possible an adherence to critical empiricism, as distinguished from the critical rationalism of that philosophy which is a logical outcome of Descartes's thought. This dis- tinction is what gives importance to a careful definition of Fontenelle's Cartesianism, and helps to determine the character of the science for which he was spokesman. III If Fontenelle rejected the methodology and meta- physics of Descartes, then what constituted his Car- tesianism ? He accepted the cosmology, to be sure, and for the reasons that I have described elsewhere. His opposition to attraction was founded on the same prin- ciples as his rejection of Descartes's metaphysics, a rejection shared by the "Cartesian physicists." How- ever, to the extent that Fontenelle insisted upon per- ceptible cause, he shared with Descartes a preference for the mechanical philosophy that contrasted sharply with the Newtonian idealization of science, and even with his own belief in the necessity for idealized math- ematics, as stated in the Preface des elemens de la geometrie de l'infini. Perceptive as Fontenelle's reasons were for defending the tourbillons, his defense of that lost cause may have constituted his only blind spot in an otherwise clear view of the development of scientific thought in his day. Fontenelle's understanding of the method of science, however, linked him to the Galilean and not to the Cartesian tradition in France. Indeed, verifies par toute une compagnie composee de gens qui ont des yeux pour voir ces sortes de choses autrement que la plupart du reste du monde de meme qu'ils ont des mains pour les chercher avec plus de dexterite et de succes. . ." 40 Fragment d'un traite de la raison humaine, (Euvres 5: 372. 38 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="39">THE METHODOLOGY OF SCIENCE it was Galileo whom he considered to be the source of modern scientific thought, and not the illustrious Frenchman.4' The real basis for Fontenelle's "Cartesianism" is yet to be stated. When homage was rendered Descartes, and it was accorded to him by many in France beside Fontenelle, it was because he had dared to challenge vested authority. It may have mattered less to his suc- cessors that he created a new system than that he had opposed an earlier one sustained by Church and Uni- versity.42 The example of doubt and independence was taken to heart by the Academy which can be said to have made it its motto. Fontenelle's successor believed this to be true, asserting that, "Indeed, it is in the Academy that one expects to find not Cartesianism but the spirit of Descartes, the spirit of doubt and dis- cussion." 43 It should be remembered that whereas English science had already declared its independence from Church and University, this goal had still to be reached in France, where those two institutions continued to be influential if no longer all powerful. It is for this reason, perhaps, that Descartes's name was enlisted in the cause of free thought, when he himself would have been disinclined to be a "libertin." Although the latter term must bear a careful definition, it is safe to say that the more serious variety of "libertinage" derived its philosophical principles from other sources, notably Montaigne and Gassendi, but took its example of the flight from authority from Descartes himself. If Fontenelle was not a Cartesian, by any careful definition of that term, neither were the overwhelming proportion of French scientists in the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries. It would not be necessary to make this statement were it not for the fact that so many writers have characterized the century from 1650 to 1750 in this fashion. Admittedly it is sometimes useful to talk of the "Age of Reason," but if the dis- cussion is to do more than simply characterize an age, then the character of reason and the manner of its use must be defined. By and large, the philosophes ex- emplified the use of Cartesian rationalism, but it is made clear by Fontenelle's description of his under- standing of science to its practitioners in the eighteenth 41 He praised Galileo on several occasions, for example in his Eloge of Viviani, he said of Galileo, "Genie rare, et dont on verra toujours le nom a la tete de quelques-unes des plus importantes decouvertes sur lesquelles oit fondee la philosophie moderne," 6: 103. 42 "Ce grand homme, pousse par son genie et par la superiorite qu'il se sentait, quitta les anciens pour ne suivre que cette meme raison que les anciens avaient suivie; et cette heureuse hardiesse, qui fut traitee de revolte, nous valut une infinite de vues nouvelles et utiles sur la physique et sur la geometrie. Alors on ouvrit les yeux, et l'on s'avisa de penser." Preface de l'analyse des infiniment petits du Marquis de l'H6pital 6: 26. 43 Mairan, Eloge de Pourfour du Petit, as quoted by P. Flourens, Eloges historiques 1: 16, Paris, 1856. century that he was at home in an indigenous tradition of empirical science. Descartes may have disdained the work of Galileo, but this was not the common attitude of the majority of his compatriots whose criticism was reserved for the younger man. Mersenne, in the tradition of Galileo whom he introduced into France, argued against the Cartesian metaphysics, preferring to define God as an arbiter of morals, and not as the sum of reason that is raised above the world of experience.44 Professor Harcourt Brown has described the early practitioners of science, who were also the founders of the Academy, as consciously anti-Cartesian in their monism and their methodology, which he characterizes as experimental. Chapelain described in a letter to Huygens how the "subtle matter" of Descartes, when put to the test of experiment, proved false. Petit and Auzout were Gassendist in method.45 Pascal thought that the senses never lied.46 Thevenot's Pro jet de la Compagnie des Sciences et des Arts suggests the program of the Royal Society,47 and Huygen's program for the projected Academy was essentially Baconian in its formulation, with never a hint of Cartesianism.48 Fontenelle had his roots in this period, and it was he who bridged the bad years at the turn of the century, and gave expression to its own best principles in a revitalized Academy. Moreover, the very significant gift of doubt that Descartes made to French science was simply an addi- tion to a tradition of free thought that had an active existence throughout the century. F. T. Perrens in his excellent book has described not only the role that Montaigne's skepticism played throughout the seven- teenth century, but has also demonstrated the influence and persistence of Gassendi's philosophy upon almost all of the leading thinkers of the time.49 Without doubt Fontenelle fell heir to nominalism and to neo-Epicurean monism. What is more to the point, however, is that he received at the hands of Gassendi and numerous others a sanction for free thought which he recast for a later age that was growing more and more susceptible to its principles. That Fontenelle's thought had its roots in a century-long search for the freedom to investigate does not make his contribution any less noteworthy, but simply easier to comprehend. His skepticism and experimentalism were common to the 44 See R. Lenoble, Mersenne, oui la naissance du mercanisme, passim, Paris, 1943. 45 Brown, H., op. cit., 122, 137. 46 The famous "esprit de finesse" of Pascal is something that he linked to the inductive operation in science, as dis- tinguished from the "esprit de geometrie," which he reserved for the reverse operation.

VI. THE MEANING OF SCIENCE I Much of the discussion in recent years about the relation of science to the humanities has centered upon the effect of science on literature. Too little has been said about the reverse effect that provided science with a place in the bosom of the more traditional disciplines at the time that it was first being formulated. It was no accident that Fontenelle, a humanist and litterateur should have been chosen as secretary of the Academie des Sciences at its renewal in 1699, not to act as a popularizer of science as many have believed, but to serve as its critic and to write its defense. Each revival of poetry has called forth its defenders, for example, Sidney, DuBellay, Wordsworth, and Shelley. The arrival of science also required a spokesman to explain its meaning and describe its uses. The value that Fontenelle attached to science linked it securely in his time to the humanities, and it could be argued that it is this link that accounts for its acceptance in eighteenth-century France, much more than any hoped for utility. The growing emphasis of recent scholarship upon the utilitarian aspects of seventeenth-century science should not be under-valued, coming as it does after a long period in which science was considered to have developed in vacuo, apart from the main social currents of the times.1 Certainly Bacon was not alone in his recognition of the material contribution that science could make to all mankind. It might almost have been fashionable for those who came after him to express hope for the better life. We know that Boyle as well as Bacon spoke for the uses of science, although neither one neglected to emphasize its purely intellectual aspects.2 Bishop Wilkins, whose imagination took him 1 See G. N. Clark, Science and social welfare in the age of Newton, Oxford, 1949, and H. Brown, The utilitarian motive in the age of Descartes, Annals of Science 1: 1936, for the social relations of science in the seventeenth century. 2 Boyle recognized the interdependence of theory and practice. "I have often wished that some ingenious friends to experi- mental philosophy would take the pains to enquire into the mysteries and other practises of trades and give us an account, some of one trade, and some of another . . . towards the melioration of the professions they write of . .. that the goods of mankind may be increased by the naturalist's insight into trades. "For I look upon a good history of trades as one of the best means to give experimental learning both growth and fertility, and like to prove to natural philosophy what a rich compost is to trees, which it mightily helps, both to grow fair and strong, and to bear much fruit." Works 3: 449. on a trip to the moon, directed his attention on nu- merous occasions to the practical uses of science.3 Even the great Newton, who we know was required to consider certain practical problems, was himself suf- ficiently motivated in this direction to advise a young man going to France to keep his eyes open for the useful things being done there that might be of interest to England.4 The French did not have to wait for the encyclo- pedists, and the so-called "Introduction of Baconianism into France" to appreciate the utilitarian motive. In his preface to Galileo's mechanics Mersenne argued that mathematics ought to be linked to engineering, for the benefit of both; the constitution of the Montmor Academy required practicality in its researches, and Huygens emphasized it in his plan for the projected Academie des Sciences.5 That Colbert had the thought of its usefulness in mind when he argued for the Acad- emy is significant, and not at all surprising, and when the Academy was reorganized in 1699 its newly ap- pointed secretary continued to voice the hope of the scientists and of the government that science could be made to benefit the country and ultimately its people. He said this at length in his Preface sur l'utilite des mathematiques et de la physique. More to the point, however, are the numerous references in the Histoire de l'Academie to the practical problems that were set it by the government, especially those that had to do with navigation.6 Bacon, for all that he stressed the utility of science, con- sidered its theory as of primary importance. "I care little about the mechanical arts themselves: only about those things which they contribute to the equipment of philosophy." Works, Ellis and Spedding, eds., 6: 271, as quoted by Walter E. Houghton, Jr., The history of trades: its relation to seventeenth- century thought, Jour. History of Ideas 2: 1941. 3 Wilkins, like Boyle, believed that scientific experiment was distinguished by practical performance. "In these practical studies, unless a man be able to go to the trial of things, he will perform but little." Mathematical and philosophical works, 197, as quoted by G. N. Clark, op. cit., 11. 4 See Correspondence of scientific men, in the collection of the Earl of Macclesfield, ed. S. Rigaud, CCXXVII, Newton to Aston, 2: 292, Oxford, 1841. 5 "II faut joindre la pratique a la theorie non seulement dans l'execution, mais aussi dans l'election des modeles, afin qu'il y n'y ait rien a redire ni 'a refaire dans les ouvrages de grand cofit comme sont les pompes du Pont Neuf et du nouveau [pont] que l'on a fait en face du Louvre, et que nul se ruine a faire accommoder les lieux de plaisir ofu l'on veut avoir des fontaines, des grottes. . . ."

SOC.</page><page sequence="41">THE MEANING OF SCIENCE However, we must be careful not to give too much emphasis to values that an earlier age held with im- portant qualifications. If Fontenelle stressed utility in the preface just mentioned, it was not to be achieved at the expense of basic science. There is never any doubt in this work that he viewed utility as a by-product of science, and not the other way around. The light cast by the disinterested search for truth might shine by reflection upon our practical problems, but for Fon- tenelle and for others it was the mind's quest for knowledge that justified science. It would seem that Fontenelle's preface, like Reaumur's Memoire of 1716, consciously, and perhaps it was hoped, subtly empha- sized the utilitarian aspects of science in order to secure badly needed funds for basic research from a not too generous government. This, after all, is a common situation with which we are not unfamiliar today. Moreover, Fontenelle gave us evidence of his fear that a practical-minded government would throttle scientific endeavor. He has told us in the Histoire de l'Acadetmie that the Marquis de Louvois, who became its protector in 1683, "wished the Academy to apply itself principally to works of a tangible and immediate utility, which would contribute to the king's glory." 8 That is precisely what happened to the Academy before 1699. It was used by Versailles to solve problems of war and siegecraft, and gambling.9 Its decline be- tween 1685 and 1699, due partly to this treatment, but also to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the im- poverishment of the nation by Louis's wars, and the susceptibility of the scientists to play at being courtiers, finally occasioned its renewal over which Fontenelle was to preside, so that he could not have failed to have been aware of the danger of direct government control. He recognized that science having become big and ex- pensive might have to be supported by the government treasury, but he agreed with the Abbe Bignon that the Academy should be kept apart from the crown for the benefit of science.10 Sciences often received orders from the government to work on a specific problem. "L'Academie ayant ete chargee en 1720 par ordre de S.A.R.M. le Regent, et sur la demande de S.A.S.M. le Comte de Toulouse, amiral de France, de deter- miner une methode pour le jaugeage des navires . . . la plus utile pour la pratique."

This is how Fontenelle saw and valued the relationship, happy that the arts and crafts could provide not only valuable information for science, but lessons in meth- odology as well. He recognized the debt that chemistry owed to pharmacy, botany to medicine, and hoped that the union between science and craft would continue to be fruitful."1 It was with this purpose in mind that the Academy undertook a description of the arts at its renewal, so that those scientists who were unable to observe the artisans at first hand would find a des- cription of their instruments and activities in the his- tory.12 The real meaning of science for Fontenelle, therefore, lay not in material improvement, nor even in the scien- tist's growing knowledge of the processes of nature, although these achievements gave added value to his activity, but in the gradual emancipation of the mind from ignorance and error that a newly formulated methodology made possible. Those susceptible to the latter process, Fontenelle sensed, were creating a new way of life for themselves that was indeed revolutionary in its implications. Nowhere is the meaning of science made more clear, and its values so appreciated as in that series of lives of the scientists that we know as the Eloges.13 chose d'approchant."

That they were not eulogies in the ordinary sense of that word but something more special has been affirmed by a number of critics. Fontenelle described his purpose in writing them in the second volume of the Eloges, first published in 1714: "Le titre d'eloges n'est pas trop juste; celui de Vies 1'efit ete davantage; car ce ne sont proprement que des Vies, telles qu'on les aurait ecrites en rendant simple- ment justice.

We are told that Regis, "dis- gusted with the excessive length of a lecture on the single question of the hour of the institution of the Eucharist," turned in despair to the Cartesian philos- ophy.14 Such a pattern of behavior is described many times over in the Eloges, with the clear implication that the mind's impatience with endless disquisition is a sure sign of sophistication. The mind must be fed in a manner suitable to its capacity. However, care must be taken to preserve its freedom of action, for any authority to which it submits will stunt its growth. Hartsoeker finally learned that lesson. His philosophy teachers were Cartesians as committed to Descartes as the scholastics had been to Aristotle. They had simply changed their slavery. Hartsoeker adopted an extreme Cartesianism which he gradually abandoned. We must always admire Descartes but follow him only oc- casionally.15 Although Cartesianism offered more substantial nourish- ment than the scholastic philosophy, it had no more right to command obedience than the system that pre- ceded it. The weaknesses of system-building and its hostility to the purposes of the Academy were set forth succinctly in Fontenelle's eloge of Malebranche, where he ex- plained that: Up till now we have recognized Father Malebranche as a metaphysician or theologian, and in these two capacities he would be a stranger to the Academy which would rashly exceed its limits if it touched on theology, and which abstains altogether from metaphysics because it appears to be too uncertain and too contentious, or at least of too little utility.16 But Malebranche was also a geometer which entitled him to a place in the Academy. So long as one's generaliza- tions did not limit one's capacity as scientist or math- ematician, Fontenelle entertained no objection to the presence of metaphysicians in the Academy, but his genuine praise was offered to those who were truly experimentalists, Du Hamel for example, who entered into questions of a general nature only regretfully.17 Of course, Fontenelle did not intend to banish theoretical considerations from science, but they were to be con- sistent with the materials of the discipline, following upon the facts, and not preceding them. It was this respect for the discipline that character- ized science, according to Fontenelle, and required the practitioner to cultivate a personal disinterestedness that was rare among human beings, and, perhaps, never 14 Eloge de Regis, CEuvres 6: 175. 15 Eloge de Hartsoeker, CEuvres 7: 213. 16Eloge de Malebranche, CEuvres 6: 420. 17 Eloge de Du Hamel, CEuvres 6: 162-163. to be found prior to that time except among saints and mystics. That a secular subject matter could provoke a seriousness and dedication that religion has com- manded was perhaps for Fontenelle the most significant feature of science. Anyone, aristocrat as well as bour- geois, could fall prey to the new humanism, but just as soon as he did so, he functioned in a totally different capacity, one that precluded self-interest, profit, gain, self-advertisement, or so Fontenelle thought. (It is perhaps in this regard that the "new humanist" was to be distinguished from his literary predecessors who appeared never to have acted without the spur of fame.) How different Renau and the Marquis de Dangeau were from the idle aristocracy. Fontenelle makes another example of Tschirnhaus who experienced something like a conversion that required him to dedicate himself to science with a seriousness that was alien to his class: "As soon as he discovered there was such a thing as geometry, he pursued it with passion." 18 It was with a sense of professional responsibility that Guglielmini turned to his task as Surintendant des Eaux, displaying a seriousness of purpose and dedication to the public that could be called by no other name than professional morality.19 In a land where even literary genius had to pay court to the king, the appearance of a morality that dictated allegiance to something other than power was nothing short of revolutionary. That such an attachment was startlingly new and therefore had its dangers was quite clear to Fontenelle. He said of Bourdelin: It is rather unique that in a country where all profes- sions, no matter what they may be, are transformed into that of a courtier, Bourdelin remained a doctor, and pur- sued only his metier at the risk of not paying court [to the king] .20 The scientist was no longer a virtuoso in the eighteenth century, but one who took on dignity to the extent that his personality became "task-oriented." 18 Eloge de Tschirnhaus, CEuvres 6: 245. On the other hand Chirac had risen from poverty to a position of eminence in science, and eventually to a patent of nobility. Science, like the Church before and the army afterwards, seemed to be "la carriere ouverte aux talents." 19 "Guglielmini eut cette delicatesse assez rare de regarder sa commission de surintendant des eaux, non comme une des ces commissions dont on s'acquitte toujours assez bien avec quelques connaissances ordinaires, et ou il suffit de ne rien gater, mais comme un engagement serieux a tourner ses prin- cipales pensees de ce c6te-la et a servir le public a toute rigueur." Eloge de Guglielmini, CEuvres 6: 282. Fontenelle equated service with righteousness when he said of Geoffroy: "Persuade qu'un medecin appartient egalement a tous les malades, il ne faisoit nulle difference entre les bonnes pratiques et les mauvaises .... De-la il est aise de conclure que ce qui dominoit dans le nombre de ses pratiques, c'etoient les obscures ou les mauvaises. . . ." Eloge de Geoffroy, CEuvres 7: 396. Fontenelle's explication of this "new morality" was appraised by the Abbe Trublet as early as 1757. More recently J. R. Carre has made it a principal point for discussion in his book, Fontenelle, Le sourire de la raison, Paris, 1932. 20 Eloge de Bourdelin, CEuvres 6: 96. 42 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="43">THE MEANING OF SCIENCE The task very often required of the scientist feats of prodigious labor, exposure to inclement weather, and fortitude to resist ill health that resulted from his activities. As Professor Butterfield has said, the scien- tist emerged as a hero in the Eloges. Fontenelle de- scribed the cost to the astronomer of his dedication to truth when he eulogized Maraldi: He was only too happy when he could remain in his study. Those long, night-time vigils that scholars and poets like to talk about are nothing in comparison with those kept in the open air and at all seasons to study the sky. Maraldi's health was ruined by such rigorous work.21 Fontenelle pointed out that, despite the great personal sacrifice with which Maraldi carried on his task, he gladly made his results available to other scientists. After all, knowledge belonged to every man, the world could assume, although this assumption was made in actuality by only the happy few. What benefit then, if any, derived to the scientist from his application to work? The rewards of science, like those of religion, Fontenelle explained, were of the spirit. He told of his pride in knowledge in the Entre- tiens and then went on to say that the tourbillons cured one of ambition and anxiety.22 How delicious the state of tranquillity was to Fontenelle and to the scientists he praised is made apparent in the following quotations. Of Reyneau, Tschirnhaus, and Varignon, Fontenelle said: [Reyneau] rid himself of all business matters, especially all manner of intrigue, and he valued very highly the advantage, so little sought of being a nobody. True philosophy had entered his heart and endowed him with this delicious tranquillity which is the greatest and least sought after of goods. I have never seen anyone who had a greater conscience, by that I mean anyone who was more concerned to fulfill the spirit of his duties, and less concerned to satisfy ap- pearances.23 That such feeling did not prevent petty jealousy and internecine warfare in the Academy is quite clear to even the casual observer, but this fact should not permit us to underestimate the importance of the stated ideal.24 It would be unfortunate, however, if we were to allow Fontenelle's use of the word "tranquillite" to mislead us. He himself has so often been charged with being an egocentric, interested only in his own mental comfort, 21 Eloge de Maraldi, (Euvres 7: 345. 22 "Ils ne guerissent . . . que de l'ambition et de l'inquietude." Entretiens sur la pluralite des mondes, (Euvres 2: 119. 23 Eloges de Reyneau, Tschirnhaus, Varignon, (Euvres 6: 260; 7: 161, 300. 24 The ideal as stated for the Academy may be summed up as follows: "Ici l'on voulut que tout fft simple, tranquille, sans ostentation d'esprit ni de science; que personne ne se crfit engage a avoir raison, et que l'on fft toujours en etat de ceder sans honte; surtout qu'aucun systeme ne dominat dans l'aca- demie a l'exclusion des autres, et qu'on laissat toujours toutes les portes ouvertes a la verite." Fontenelle, Preface de l'histoire de l'Acadenie des Sciences, (Euvres 6: 21. that it would be possible to read this value into the state of mind that he described. Happily, the accusa- tion is true neither of Fontenelle nor of the scientists he undertook to praise. It should be clear from our discussion that it was not a state of personal comfort that Fontenelle valued, but the very opposite of ego- centrism, the disinterestedness, unconcern for petty advantage, largeness of spirit that science made pos- sible for its practitioners. That this morality was not only a matter of personality but was thought to derive from science is made clear by the following excerpts from the Eloges of Maraldi, Du Hamel, and Varignon. His character was that which the sciences form ordi- narily in those who make it their sole occupation: serious- ness, simplicity, righteousness. One easily saw that his humility was not a pose but a feeling founded on science itself. His character was as simple as his superiority of mind could require. I have already given this same praise to so many persons in this academy that one would believe the merit to pertain rather more to our sciences than to our savants.25 It can be seen finally that Fontenelle was talking about an unusual breed of men when he said in praising Lemery that, "this praise pertains rather generally to this small, private group of men that the business of science separates from the majority of mankind." 26 Whatever selflessness Fontenelle discovered in the scientists of his generation he was justified in describing as the highest pinnacle of moral behavior to which the human personality can succeed. It did indeed bear a certain resemblance to the behavior of saintly persons; so that the new humanism that Fontenelle set out to praise was not without religious values. However, if science has the capacity to induce morality, there is a quality of mind upon which science itself may be said to depend, and that is mental curios- ity. Far from praising peace of mind, Fontenelle held it accountable for a lack of science among the Chinese whom he believed to be tranquil by nature. True science, he opined, required an unquiet state of mind, an incapacity to be satisfied.27 Fontenelle very clearly distinguished between the moral qualities induced by science and the state of mind necessary to its practice. Having done that, he affirmed no contradiction between the contentment proceeding from the former state and the divine discontent that was a condition of the latter. It is not surprising that Fontenelle should have attached a morality to science when it is remembered that he viewed the pursuit of knowledge with almost 25 Eloges de Maraldi, Du Hamel, Varignon, (Euvres 6: 173; 7: 350, 160. 26 Eloge de Lemery, (Euvres 6: 382. The effect of Fon- tenelle's critique of the scientists was summed up by the Abbe Trublet: "II les represente partout comme des Sages qui cherchent paisiblement la verite, qui s'aident mutuellement dans cette recherche, quit doutent de l'avoir trouve; il leur donne ses propres disposition, ce modeste scepticisme qui etoit un des principaux traits de son caractere."

He has told us that, "physics becomes a kind of theology when it is pursued correctly." 28 According to Fontenelle, the subject matter of science testified to the intelligence and the power of the Creator. Therefore, we might say that it becomes the religious duty of the scientist to investigate nature. The crea- tion of a comprehensive body of knowledge that would be an accurate description of nature might be the goal of science, but such knowledge would yield more than power. "Nature is never so admirable or so admired as when it is understood." 29 Discovery would afford us the pleasure of contemplation and admiration which is akin to that of worship. Let us note that the aesthetic satisfaction to be derived from science is not extrinsic to it, according to Fontenelle, but an essential ingredient of it. However, if Fontenelle accorded reverence to knowl- edge, he attached an even greater value to the thought that won it. In a burst of optimism he went so far as to relate thought to virtue, saying, "Whoever has the leisure to think discovers nothing better than to be virtuous." 30 As a rule, however, he needed no such justification for thinking, for the mind's activity was itself a positive good. It was the mind that had made the greatest discovery in science, the art of discovery itself, for this is the device by which the mind im- plements its activity,31 the device that goes under the name of method. The method of science, which is the keystone of its whole structure, is no more than mind rightly conducted. Conversely, method is given credit for having raised the mind to new levels of excellence and productivity. In describing the utility of math- ematics, Fontenelle concluded the list of benefits to be derived from it as follows: Finally, mathematics has not only produced for some time now an infinity of truths of its own kind, it has also produced rather generally in the minds of men a refine- ment more precious perhaps than all these truths.32 There is no doubt that Fontenelle viewed the mind as the ultimate beneficiary of science, and he must be given credit for having helped to establish that value of science in France.33 28 Preface sur l'utilite des mathematiqucs et de la physique, (CEuvres 6: 70. 29Ibid., 72. 30 Eloge de Homberg, (Euvres 6: 398. 31 Eloge de Leibnitz 6: 472: "L'art de decouvrir en mathe- matiques est plus precieux que la plupart des choses que l'on decouvre." 32 Preface de l'histoire de l'Academie des Sciences, (Euvres 6: 2. 33 Montesquieu paid Fontenelle the tribute of imitation when he listed the benefits of science. The difference between savagery and civilization, he declared, is made by the arts and sciences. The Indians would never have been conquered if they had possessed them, as Fontenelle had suggested in the Dialogues des morts. But the real benefits of science accrue to the mind. Montesquieu lists them as the satisfaction of the urge for self-improvement, and the satisfaction of our natural curiosity, the acquisition of a method for study, the pleasure III The mental, moral, and aesthetic values that Fon- tenelle ascribed to science were central to his thought and to the life of science in his time. Without them Fontenelle could not have perceived the beauty of science. With them he could cultivate the quality of disinterestedness that alone makes science possible. Al- though these values were attached to the matter of science, according to the author of the Eloges, quite clearly they had their roots in the long literary and religious experience of Western Europe. Indeed Fon- tenelle insisted that a background in the humanities provided rather specific qualities necessary to science. How revealing the following quotation is, taken from a speech that he read before the Academie francaise in 1741, near the end of his professional career. Speaking about the activity of the Academy, he touched on the importance of language. The spirit of order, clarity, and precision necessary in this delicate research will be the key to the most abstruse sciences provided one applies it correctly; and I acquired here the first tincture of this spirit that allowed me to discharge my new duties [as secretary of the Academie des Sciences.] Thus, gentlemen, it was the Academie frangaise that formed me first of all.34 The acknowledgment that literature assisted in the development of his scientific capacities, that qualities of clarity, order and precision so necessary to science should have derived from his concern with language is what renders Fontenelle a surprising phenomenon to us. But Fontenelle was not unique in his time. Maupertuis and d'Alembert were both equally ac- complished as mathematicians and essayists. Buffon was of course a master stylist, and La Condamine was not only a physicist, but a writer of agreeable verse.35 The "New Philosophy" seems to have grown in the bosom of the older disciplines, a fact very often over- looked when the reverse effect of science upon literature, history, and philosophy is described. There is a more specific case in which science was indebted to the humanities. It may be remembered that in 1694 the Dictionnaire of the Academie franqaise called for the expunging of scientific terms from the language. Fontenelle appreciated the extreme sensitivity of his compatriots to language, but realized the necessity of creating a scientific language if science itself was to progress. It was his glory that he helped to do so of study itself, and the satisfaction of the urge to benefit society. Fontenelle is mentioned as a source for the idea of science.

AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="45">THE MEANING OF SCIENCE without creating monstrosities of jargon and style. Speaking before the Academie francaise in 1741, after the battle had already been won, Fontenelle explained his role as literary pioneer for science: When the Academie des Sciences was renewed. . . [The Abbe Bignon] desired to see the taste for science spread in society. Science had used, as in ancient Egypt, a certain sacred language understood by its priests alone. The new director wished it to speak the common language, as far as possible, and he did me the honor of making me its interpreter.36 Fontenelle did indeed help to fashion a "common" language for science and it should be possible to say with equal assurance that its creation was a direct contribution to science itself. Of course, the attention to language had that other object in mind, popularization. The traditional French sensitivity to language made a suppleness, clarity, and precision of exposition necessary if the task was to be fulfilled. Fontenelle was describing his role as secretary of the Academy when he spoke of it in his eloge of Du Hamel: The Academy needed a secretary who understood and could speak the languages of the different savants, be their interpreter, and give a certain clarity to their writ- ings, and finally who was disinterested and exempt from all partiality.37 The popularization of science in the eighteenth century had widespread effects and is a subject all its own, but this much may be noted, that it had no small importance in the growth and ultimate acceptance of science itself. Fontenelle clothed science in the language of the human- ities, and it was this achievement that won a place for it in the public consciousness. Montesquieu, writing in 1725, thought the Pluralite des mondes more useful than other more serious works, "because it was the most serious that the majority of people were in a condition to read . . . and often one says some very important things while joking." 38 There were many others who applauded Fontenelle's work of populariza- tion, for it was seen that in addition to educating the public a friendly environment was being created that would ease the task of the scientists. Propaganda for science went hand in hand with popularization. Fon- tenelle had ceased making pleasantries when he wrote the Eloges, but they like the Entretiens succeeded in capturing an audience that can be represented by the twelve editions of his complete works that appeared during the course of the eighteenth century. We must remember that Fontenelle did not intend to paint a series of portraits in the Eloges, but rather to write a critique of the lives of the scientists in the manner we have described. These "lives" were in- cluded in the successive numbers of the Histoire de 36 Discours a l'Academie franfaise, 1741, Euzvres 1: 167. 37 Eloge de Du Hamel 6: 163. 38 Op. cit., 226. I'Academie before they were republished in a separate volume, so that they should be considered within the context of the Histoire, and with the purpose of that publication clearly in mind. Fontenelle explained in the Preface of 1699 that the Histoire as distinguished from the Memoires was designed for those with only a limited knowledge of mathematics and physics.39 Such a distinction it was hoped would have the following advantage, "That the work of the Academy would become better known, and that the taste for science would be spread more widely." 40 Indeed Fontenelle was picked as secretary of the Academy with this object in mind. It can be assumed, therefore, that Fontenelle wrote the Eloges with the purpose also of propagandizing for science. The Abbe Trublet tells us that he was eminently successful in this enterprise. "The taste for science being more widely spread, the savants have become more esteemed, more considered, more sought after." 41 Let it be stated once again that it was science itself that was being promoted, not public education, and not, as Professor Butterfield has sug- gested, Cartesianism or the rising bourgeoisie. Al- though one commentator has said that, "One cannot read the histories of these illustrious dead, without being seized by the desire to follow in their footsteps," 42 it is safe to say that Fontenelle succeeded not so much in winning large numbers to the practice of science as he did in winning many to its cause. The role of spokesman for science served another function that few have recognized. Fontenelle spoke directly to the scientists when he explained the prin- ciples of science, when he declared its link to the humanities, when he argued for the whole man. D'Alem- bert praised Fontenelle in the Encyclopedie, "for having taught the savants to shake off the yoke of pedantry." 43 Fontenelle taught the savants themselves that they could remain hommes d'esprit while cultivating the sciences. The whole man, he believed, need never be sacrificed to the demands of specialization. The link that Fon- tenelle helped to forge between science and the human- ities created a breed of men who moved from one to the other and in doing so put a stamp on an age in history that we call the Enlightenment. 39 "On a eu dessein que sur tous les sujets, soit qu'ils lui fussent communs avec les memoires, soit qu'ils lui fussent particuliers, l'histoire ffit plus proportionnee a la portee de ceux qui n'ont qu'une mediocre teinture de mathematiques et de physique."

THE SOCIAL SCIENCES I The method of science became for Fontenelle the keystone of its structure, because it is self-regulating, possessed of the capacity to criticize itself, and so to contribute to the progress of science. However, the method is useful outside of science and is perhaps the only scientific discovery which it is safe to employ in this fashion. Unlike the Cartesian mechanists who promoted animal automatism, or the social Darwinists who attempted to apply the findings of science to society, Fontenelle was too careful a thinker to ignore the specific contexts of discovery. Properly used, how- ever, the method could serve to open the subject of society for investigation; properly understood it was itself the principle of explanation in history. Viewed in the perspective of time, the development of man's mental tools defined his progress in the past, and might allow him to direct it in the future. We have already discovered that Fontenelle con- sidered men to be alike everywhere and in all times. This he believed not on the basis of a sanguine hope in the rationality of man, but out of the conviction that men shared a common experience on the passional level. This belief, however, did not blind him to the fact that social differences existed and that a study of those differences was of great importance to mankind. The value that Fontenelle placed on knowledge pre- vented him from justifying ignorance on any basis like Christian pessimism, for with the proper tools at his command for the first time in history, he argued, man could make sense out of his social experience, limiting the area in which he had to accept a law of life on faith. In the Digression sur les anciens et les modernes (1688), Fontenelle enunciated a theory of progress that could not have been formulated outside the sphere of science. The two principles on which it rests, that nature is always equipped with the same capacity to produce great men, and that progress is represented by the social accumulation of knowledge, are closely linked to the scientific experience of the seventeenth century. That century acknowledged the universal law of nature, which it understood to be invariable at all times, and it grew ever more conscious of the social relations of its science. It was the latter fact that made possible an awareness of the contribution of science to society, and the valuation of that contribution as a principle for social progress. The Digression begins with a discussion of nature's capacities in different times. Fontenelle argued that the whole question of preeminence between the ages rests on whether or not that capacity changes, for if one age is favored by men who are naturally superior, then all other living things in that age would show a cor- responding degree of excellence. Obviously we have no reason to suppose that trees were any bigger or better in Homer's time. Therefore, it is only common sense to conclude that men's brains were no better in the golden age of Greece. But we can be on safer ground than this if we assume certain things to be true about nature. For example: "Nature has a certain paste in its hands which is always the same and which it works and reworks ceaselessly in a thou- sand ways, and from which it forms men, animals and plants." 1 Fontenelle felt it unnecessary to argue this point at length, although it was to remain a subject for debate in science for many years to come. If the world of nature has sustained no changes in historical time, then what accounts for the obvious differences between peoples? There are distinctions, Fontenelle argued, but they are to be made in space and not in time. If trees are equally large in all centuries, they are not so in all countries. Recognizing the interdependence of physical phenomena, Fontenelle spoke for the influence of climate upon man's capacities: "We are sure that by the linkage and reciprocal de- pendence between all parts of the material world. climatic differences which are felt in plants must extend to brains and have some effect on them." 2 Although this idea preceded Montesquieu's discussion by nearly half a century, nevertheless it is no statement of climatic determinism. With perception and so- phistication Fontenelle went on to minimize the effect of climate upon social development. However the effect is smaller and less evident in this case, because the arts and cultivation exercise a greater influence on minds than on the earth. . . . Thus the thoughts of one country are transferred more easily to another than its plants, and we do not have nearly so much trouble incorporating the Italian spirit in our works as we do in raising orange trees.3 Because ideas are readily exchanged, they tend to be- come uniform everywhere. Whatever special character- istics a people received originally from its climate, the passage of time would certainly produce changes in them. In any case, it is rather impossible to tell just what climate is most favorable to the spirit. All have advantages and disadvantages that balance each other out, so that we are forced to conclude that climate counts for nothing so long as the mind is equally cultivated in all varieties of it.4 Convinced that he had stated the problem in its proper terms, Fontenelle concluded that he had effec- tively denied the inherent superiority of the Ancients. But what in fact did account for the excellence of their contribution to culture ? It is clear that the government, the general state of affairs, in short, the social climate 1 Fontenelle, Digression sur les anciens et les modern es, i(Euvres 5: 281. 2 Ibid., 282. 3 Idem. 4 Moreover, the climate of Greece and France are very nearly the same, he argued, so that it is difficult to believe that any difference in culture could have been the result of climate. 46 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="47">THE SOCIAL SCIENCES had something to do with it. Furthermore, there is the simple fact that they came to the problems first. Only in this sense can time be reckoned a factor. The ancients invented everything: their partisans win on this point. Therefore they had much more intelligence than we: not at all; they came before us. .... If we had been in their place, we would have done the inventing; if they were in ours they would add to what they found invented. There is no mystery here.5 Without doubt then it is the situation and not the breed of men that is the determining factor in creative ac- tivity.6 However, Fontenelle did not view the order of dis- covery as being a mechanical matter. He recognized that chance played an important part in bringing ideas to fruition and, even more important, that genius was indispensable to bringing them into existence. But the genius of an Archimedes might have turned to inventing the plow in an earlier time. What allowed him to surpass his spiritual ancestors were the victories that they had already won for him. Not only man's victories, but his defeats too help his successors to further con- quests. "We are obliged to the ancients for having exhausted the largest part of the false ideas that one can have; error and ignorance simply must be paid the tribute that the ancients have paid, and we must not fail to pay our respect to those who have freed us from them." 7 How the partisans of the ancients must have bridled at this remark! Not only did the Greeks fail to surpass us; they were also incorrect about many things. Moreover, and Fontenelle's sense of history is revealed here with even greater sharpness, we value their mistakes, and we value the Greeks for having made them. This is a debt paid to ignorance that Voltaire was unwilling to pay, if indeed the Middle Ages could be described as ignorant. Fontenelle acknowledged one obvious exception to the order of discovery. To the extent that they depend on primitive imagination, the poetic arts might have reached a peak of perfection in ancient times which could be equalled but never surpassed. Even this statement must be qualified to admit certain contribu- tions that a later age made to poetry. In another work entitled Sur la Poesie en general, Fontenelle argued that 5 Digression sur les anciens et les modernes, CEuvres 5: 285. 6"La nature produit, dans tous les siecles, des hommes propres a etre de grands hommes; mais les siecles ne leur permettent pas toujours d'exercer leurs talens. Des inonda- tions peu favorables aux sciences et aux arts, des prejuges et des fantaisies, qui peuvent prendre une infinite de formes dif- ferentes, tel qu'est a la Chine le respect des cadavres qui empeche qu'on ne fasse aucune anatomie, des guerres uni- verselles, etablissent souvent, et pour long-tems, l'ignorance et le mauvais gout. . . . On dit que le ciel, en faisant naitre de grands rois, fait naitre aussi de grands poetes pour les chanter, d'excellens historiens pour ecrire leurs vies. Ce qu'il y a de vrai, c'est qu'en tous tems les historiens et les poetes sont tout prets, et que les princes n'ont qu'a vouloir les mettre en ceuvre." Ibid., 295. 7 Ibid., 287. poetry appealed to the mind as well as to the senses. (Poets could be distinguished on this basis between those with talent and those with esprit.) To the extent that philosophy had been perfected in the seventeenth century, and been diffused throughout the world of letters, qualities of clarte, ordre, justesse had been added to poetry. Esprit building on talent had elevated poetry to the level of philosophy, so that as an art form it was capable finally of expressing ideas, of becoming a vehicle for the mind.8 It was the mind, therefore, that was the chief and most important beneficiary of the passage of the ages. If scientific knowledge grew with the accumulation of discoveries, the mind developed as it learned how to reason correctly with experience. The Greeks were often vague and confused in their thinking, but in Fontenelle's time, "one wants his reasoning to be intelligible, correct, conclusive." 9 In short, the mind had discovered the proper method for its use. More- over, the mind would continue to improve with further use. New methods were constantly being devised as new problems arose in science; the mind seemed always equal to its task. Mathematics and physics are sciences whose yoke be- came progressively heavier on the savants; it seemed that finally these sciences would have to be abandoned. But method developed at the same time. The same mind that perfects things by adding new ideas also perfects the method of learning them by shortening it and furnishes new means to embrace the new scope that is given to science. A savant of this century knows ten times more than a savant of Augustus' time, but he had ten times more of the means to become a savant.10 That Fontenelle valued the perfection of the mind as the first goal of science has already been discussed in a previous chapter. Let us note here that such a goal lies at the heart of his idea of progress, for with the proper use of the mind we have no need of the past at all. After all, where had the ancients looked for answers to their questions? In nature, Fontenelle declared. Had 8 Sur la Poesie en gene'ral 3: 191 ff. This work is an inter- esting discussion of the origins of poetry, its properties and genres. 1ontenelle argued that talent can never surpass itself, but "esprit" is in a position to build on past knowledge, so that the extent to which talent and "esprit" work together in the creation of poetry makes progress possible even in that area. The milieu is a limiting factor for poetry too. "Chacque siecle a un degre de lumiere qui lui est propre." Vie de Corneille, (Euvres 3: 68. Of course the work of art must be judged by itself, but the author must be judged in terms of his century. Fontenelle acknowledged Racine to be superior as poet and playwright to his own uncle, Corneille, but he credited Corneille with having prepared the ground for his successor. Fontenelle believed that something different from the classical style of poetry was required by his age, and he praised twelfth-century poetry because it was natural and did not imitate the Greeks, who were better orators than poets. 9 Digression sur les anciens et les modernes, CEuvres 5: 289. 10 Ibid., 300. 47 VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959]</page><page sequence="48">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE their achievements been lost to us, we would have only to turn to nature to duplicate their efforts. Therefore, the moderns had learned that a critical empiricism and the mind's independence from authority are the best guarantees for success in science. "Nothing halts prog- ress, nothing limits the mind so much as excessive admiration of the ancients. ... .If some day people enshrine Descartes and substitute him for Aristotle, this would amount to the same disadvantage." 11 As- suming that conditions are favorable to science, that is, that man will be allowed the free exercise of his mind, there is every reason to believe that the mind's atten- tion to nature would produce the same results for a second time. We should only have taken the place of the ancients in the order of achievement. The implication is clear from the foregoing statements that there is a necessary order to the succession of discoveries. Fontenelle made this idea explicit in a later work when he said, "There is an order which regulates our progress. Each idea develops only after a certain number of preceding ideas are developed, and when its turn to flourish has come." 12 It is, of course, the fact of a necessary order that makes an idea of progress possible, and this is one of Fontenelle's signal contributions to the formulation of that idea. It was also Fontenelle's connection of mind with progress that gave the idea its true direction; for an idea of progress that said less for the results of science than it did for the mental discipline that is its essential feature allowed it to project itself into the indefinite future. It is the proper use of the mind, therefore, that establishes the fact of progress, that defines it, and that determines its order.13 With this in mind, it is easy to see how Fontenelle could have conceived of progress as being necessary (although not automatic) in the future. The image of the young child, who was classical man, growing into maturity in the seventeenth century and then decaying thereafter, gave way to the belief in the limitless capacities of mind that could know no old age. Fon- tenelle said in concluding the Digression: It is annoying to be unable to push so nice a comparison to its logical conclusion: but I am obliged to avow that mankind will never grow old. It will always be capable of youthful things and even more of the things of maturity; that is to say, abandoning the allegory, that man will 11 Ibid., 303. 12 Preface des elemens de la geometrie de l'infini, (Euvres 6: 42. 13 There are of course two interpretations of the contribution of science to progress: that science is an instrument of progress valid outside of its method. This is essentially Descartes's point of view. Fontenelle subscribed to it, but emphasized the other one that derived from Pascal, that the worth of science is found in its method, to be used in society as well as in science. This interpretation precludes analogizing from the data of science to society as Holbach did when he used the principle of inertia to define social progress. never decay and that the fresh views of succeeding bons esprits will always add up.14 It is of great importance that Fontenelle shifted his gaze from object to subject, and thought of progress not so much as a social fact in the Baconian manner, but as the possession of the individual consciousness. His definition of science as a thing of the mind and of progress as being dependent on both allows us to comprehend his understanding of science as the "new humanism." Whatever advantages or disadvantages accrue to us from the applications of science, there is no denying that it is a new instrument at hand that satisfies one of man's oldest desires, the need to dis- cover the intelligible behind the appearances. In its function as a means to enlightenment it stands as the most recent accomplishment to be added to the con- tributions that the Greek and Christian experiences had made.15 Although the Digression was published at the height of the battle between the Ancients and Moderns and should be viewed in that context as a blow struck for the autonomy and freedom of science from authority, nevertheless, the fact that Fontenelle had expressed him- self on this subject prior to 1688 and afterwards when the battle had already been won for science suggests that the subject had an additional meaning to the one just stated.16 Indeed, as I have indicated in the pre- ceding paragraph, Fontenelle's formulation of an idea of progress seems more of an attempt to clarify the role of science for its practitioners and sympathizers than an effort to displace the humanist values with which he had no real quarrel. He continued to express himself on this subject in later years, giving meaning to his ideas of science and his idea of progress by a suc- cession of statements that spoke for the brotherhood of bons esprits and the pleasure they found in their activity, although his ideas were not without wider ramifications and influence, as we shall see.17 14 Digression sur les anciens et les modernes, ?Euvres 5: 298. 15 Indeed, it can be said that science was, for Fontenelle, a union of the Greek and Christian experiences, a synthesis of the humanist and Christian impulses, as I have tried to prove. 16 The quarrel between the ancients and the moderns was officially joined in France, so far as science was concerned, as early as 1666. "De ceux qui ont excelle dans la connoissance des choses naturelles, les uns se sont attachez a Aristote avec tant de scrupule qu'ils n'ont rien voulu recevoir que ce qu'il enseigne, les autres s'en sont esloignez avec tant de passion qu'ils ont entierement rejette sa doctrine; et comme les premiers ont quelquefois mieux aime estre du parti d'Aristote que de celuy de la verite, les derniers ont souvent mieux aime estre du parti de la verite que d'estre de celuy d'Aristote." Journal des Scavans, 23 aofit, 1666. Fontenelle had already stated in the Entretiens and the Dialogues des morts that scientific progress was possible, although the human heart would remain forever the same. 17 Fontenelle raised the question of progress in the Preface de l'analyse des infiniment petits du Marquis de l'H6pital, and again in the Preface sur l'utilite des mathematiques, saying in 48 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="49">THE SOCIAL SCIENCES The question should certainly be raised at this time of the originality of Fontenelle's idea of progress. That there was a rich tradition of speculation on this sub- ject, from which Fontenelle derived inspiration, is known to the reader of Professor Bury's popular book. This much should be said, however: if Bacon's words were in the air, and if those of Wilkins were read by Fontenelle, if Pascal may have supplied Fontenelle with the Baconian idea, nevertheless it was Fontenelle's achievement to have formulated for the first time the complete idea of progress.'8 It was he who first defined progress as necessary and extending indefinitely into the future.19 That it was not exclusively a doctrine of social progress or of automatic progress, the author hopes has been made clear. Progress was indeed a social fact, but a fact about man's intellectual capacities that was applicable to all peoples by virtue of their humanity. With this idea in mind it is difficult to see how Gregoire could have deduced the idea of racism that he professes to find implicit in the Digression. Noting Fontenelle's avowal of the folly of all people, and the superiority of some individuals and nations, he con- cludes that the perpetual secretary had intended France to lead the world into enlightenment, and to do so by virtue of the native excellence of its leading figures. But Fontenelle could not have been so parochial in his outlook, as we shall see in the next chapter, nor did he believe that scientific genius was limited to France in the first work that progress was the result of "une suite de l'egalite naturelle des esprits et de la succession necessaire des decouvertes," and in the second, "Quelle efit ete la surprise des anciens, si on leur efit predit qu'un jour leur posterite, par le moyen de quelques instrumens, verrait une infinite d'objets qu'ils ne voyaient pas, un ciel qui leur etoit inconnu, des plantes et des animaux dont ils ne soupqonnaient seulement pas la possibilite ?" (Euvres 6: 71. 18 Wilkins had said, "But yet 'twere a shame for these later ages to rest ourselves merely upon the labours of our fore- fathers, as if they had informed us of all things to be known; and when we are set upon their shoulders, not to see further than they themselves did." Prop. II, op. cit., 19. It would be difficult to believe that Fontenelle had not seen Pascal's Fragment d'une preface du traite sur le vide, in which he argued that we and not the Greeks are the ancients. 19 Bury points out that although the past and present had been accounted for, "the theory of the progress of knowledge includes and acquires its value by including the definite future. This step was taken by Fontenelle. The idea had been almost excluded by Bacon's misleading metaphor of old age, which Fontenelle expressly rejects. Man will have no old age; his intellect will never degenerate; and the sound views of intel- lectual men in successive generations will continually add up." J. B. Bury, The idea of progress, 109, London, 1928. As we have seen, Fontenelle added a second ingredient to complete the idea of progress; he conceived of progress as necessary and certain, as well as extending indefinitely into the future. Did Fontenelle supply Comte with his famous three stages of progress? Certainly it is implied in Fontenelle's work that explanation of natural phenomena had once been given in the fanciful manner of myth, then in the rationalist manner of philosophy, and not till his own time had it been based on empirically gathered data. his day. Moreover, he could not have believed this and still have held to the ideas expressed in the Digres- sion that declared the "constancy of the human mind, the development of it with invention, and the displace- ment of cultures." 20 Gregoire acknowledges Fon- tenelle's belief that any people can succeed at science, provided the condition of its culture is favorable to the pursuit of it, but fails to see that this is one deciding factor among peoples similarly endowed with intelli- gence and natural folly. What serves to confuse many critics is Fontenelle's belief that most people and some nations seem unable to rise above ignorance and error in the conduct of their mental lives. If the human mind is constant, human idiocy seems at the very least to be chronic. But the latter idea, although related to the idea of progress, is not to be construed as a declaration of human im- potence in the face of ignorance. The statement of the dual nature of man that plays so large a part in the great literary tradition of France is given another di- mension by Fontenelle's treatment of it within the con- text of the scientific experience. The harmony that Fontenelle hoped to effect between passion and reason has already been considered in our discussion of the Dialogues des morts. Here we must raise the ques- tion once again within the specific context of the social definition of knowledge. II Fontenelle gave expression to a favorite theme of the eighteenth century when the protagonist in one of his works declared that in all his travels he had dis- covered nothing more remarkable than the similarity of men.21 But this was not a statement about mankind, least of all about the common goodness of humanity. Fontenelle made his point when he had Romieu reply to the following question: "How is that," answered the Count. "All those who return from foreign lands report so many marvelous things about them !" "I believe it," replied Romieu. "There are some eyes more suitable for seeing marvels than others. As for me, I have seen Greeks, Turks, Saracens, even Tartars. But these are only men. .. ." 22 The susceptibility of the mind to yield to the temptation of the marvelous was the surest sign, according to Fon- tenelle, of mental primitivism. The progress of human- ity from fable to fact is the subject of the work we should like to consider now. Fontenelle went straight to the point in the Origine des fables (1724), when he declared their "absurdity" and probed for the cause of their existence and spread. Finding it presented no great difficulty for him. The extent of man's ignorance and lack of experience, he 20 These are Gregoire's own words used to describe the Digression. 21 Histoire du Romieu de Provence, (Euvres 8: 15. 22 Ibid., 15. 49 VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959]</page><page sequence="50">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE argued, governs the number of marvels that he sees. Of course, the imagination adds color to the tale when the event is described to an audience, and finding the audience receptive to a story, the teller is likely to embroider it further when he recounts it for a second time. All of this assumes an innocent exuberance, and fails to take into account those who purposely lie. Should the story pass from mouth to mouth then the likelihood of its distortion is rendered even greater, so that ultimately not even the original falsehood may remain. Furthermore, the first steps in scientific explanation may add to the store of fables. Thus the primitive Greeks imagined a God who poured rivers from a pot just as they poured water for their own use. The principle of explanation for such an invention is a simple one, "that is, we explain the unknown by what we already know, and we transfer to physics what experiment teaches us. We have discovered by usage, and not by divination. . . 23 It was in this manner that Gods and Goddesses were born. The things that happened in nature that man could not reproduce were explained by the action of creatures more powerful than they. In a primitive society physical prowess is likely to be stressed above wisdom or justice, and it is this fact that proved to Fontenelle the historical age of the Greek divinities, and the method of their creation. Furthermore, if power is the sole criterion for divinity, it follows that the human imagination will be receptive to a plurality of Gods who are at war with each other. With a sophistication that is remarkable in his time, Fontenelle linked man's conceptualizing activity with the level of his civilization. Thus, the inclination to ascribe goodness to the creator may not have ap- peared until goodness itself was valued by society. Similarly, the Roman historians, in their search for drama, were less motivated by the truth than by verisimilitude. Presumably, only a scientific age is capable of the truthful recording of fact. The appeal of fables, therefore, is to the curiosity and imagination of all peoples, no matter where we may find them. Once the fable is accepted there is a rush to create others, for if one may be believed, why not many? Just as soon as each fable is accepted, time works to make it hallowed. It is the blind belief in antiquity that accounts for the persistence of fables; thus, it is a state of ignorance that explains them, a state of enlightenment that will dissipate them. All peoples have a talent for myth-making that is in- dependent of geography and climate; to support this contention, Fontenelle ventured an exercise in com- parative anthropology: I will show . . . if I must an astonishing similarity be- tween the fables of the American Indians and those of the Greeks. The Americans send the souls of their bad 23 De l'Origine des fables, (Euvres 5: 345. Carre argues on the basis of internal evidence that the work was composed much earlier than 1724, in the 1680's or 1690's, perhaps. people to certain marshy, disagreeable lakes, as the Greeks sent theirs to the banks of their rivers Styx and Acheron. The Americans believe that rain falls when a boy who is playing with his sister in the clouds breaks her jug of water. Does that not resemble the story about nymphs who pour water from their urns? . . . which shows that for a long time the Greeks were as savage as the Ameri- cans . . . proving that the same ignorance produces the same effects among all peoples.24 To the author's knowledge, this is the first such com- parison to be made in the seventeenth century. Fontenelle went on to explain that all peoples have a tendency to elevate their myths into a religion, with the exception, of course, of the chosen people, whom he declared were enlightened by divine revelation. The Greeks added another dimension to their fables by expressing them in poetry and painting, thus making them things of beauty. This fact proved to Fontenelle that the contradiction between reason and imagination could be resolved through beauty; for his contem- poraries were inclined to disbelieve the fables, yet continued to derive aesthetic satisfaction from them. He concluded this work with a warning to misguided philosophers who sought for allegories of science in the fables of the Greeks. (One is reminded instantly of Bacon.) The ancient myth-makers knew nothing about nature or morals. It is better to accept the fables for what they are, fanciful tales of a primitive people, than to exercise one's fancy in the attempt to dignify them with the title of science. Let us not look for anything else in the fables but the history of error of the human mind. .... It is no science to fill one's head with all the extravagances of the Greeks and Phoenicians, but it is one to know what has led the Greeks and Phoenicians to these extravagances. All men resemble each other so much, that there is no people whose stupidities ought not to make us tremble.25 Fontenelle's moral that our proper task is not to look for science in the Greek myths, but to make a science out of the study of them, is advice that he himself followed; indeed modern anthropology owes a debt to him that it recognizes in some of its texts. What began as an interest in the origin of fables in connection with the quarrel between Ancients and Moderns grew to a point of doctrine that was central to Fontenelle's thought about science.26 We shall have occasion in the next chapter to be explicit about his speculation on the reciprocal roles of science and society. 24Ibid., 365. 25Ibid., 372. 26 Fontenelle spoke about the origin of fables through Homer in the Dialogues des morts, and in the Entretiens he declared the moon's inhabitants to be no less foolish than the earth's in this regard. He raised the question again in the Digression where he considered that the ancients wrote philosophy like poets. Of course there is a difference between the language of poetry and of science, metaphor, and analysis, and Fontenelle appreciated the first as well as the second. He insisted, how- ever, that the two be kept separate, although he himself some- times escaped from that rule. 50 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="51">THE SOCIAL SCIENCES Let us note, however, that he continued throughout his career to inveigh against the human addiction to the falsely marvelous that constituted the greatest stumbling block to the progress of knowledge. The Histoire de l'Academie is filled with references to the superstition found in the pseudo sciences and the persistent tendency to create myths; 27 the Eloges give evidence of his continued interest in this subject.28 We know that he avidly read the accounts of the mis- sionaries,29 and that he had written another work on the subject of myth-making, the Histoire des oracles. What distinguishes the Origine des fables, however, is the introduction of the comparative method into the study of society. One may be excused for wondering whether com- parative anatomy could have influenced Fontenelle in his choice of method for his social studies. Whether or not this is true, his use of it enabled his audience to reflect upon the similarities and differences among men, not on the basis of philosophical speculation, but upon the very firm foundation of empirical evidence. If pragmatic behavior was an ingredient in social in- vention, then, as Fontenelle noted, it became possible to formulate a science of human development that was based on invention. Man's inventions of ideas as well 27 "L'academie croit faire autant en desabusant le public des fausses merveilles qu'en lui annoncant les veritables." H.A., 1702: 22. Fontenelle doubted that it would be possible to extract money from someone in return for the secret of making it if we were not all so greedy for riches. We are not required to prove it impossible to make gold, he declared, for, "Les impossibilites, hormis les geometriques, ne se demontrent guere, mais une extreme difficulte, prouvee d' une certaine faqon par l'experience, doit etre traitee comme une impossibilite, sinon dans la theorie au moins dans la pratique." H.A., 1722: 52. Examining some of the maritime feats of the ancients which are rendered more plausible when their maps are corrected to make distances shorter, Fontenelle concluded that one ought not so much to doubt extraordinary facts as to doubt that they are as extra- ordinary as they seem. H.A., 1714: 101. In 1729 Fontenelle stated that salamanders, despoiled of their magical properties by Maupertuis' observations, are none- theless marvelous creatures of nature, that is, marvelous in the true sense of that word. 28 There is an interesting passage in the Eloge of Bianchini that speculates on the social relations of mythology. "Bianchini fait toujours grand cas de ce qu'il appelle la Thalassocratie, l'empire ou du moins l'usage libre de la mer. Selon Bianchini, ce n'etoit point du ravissement d'Helene qu'il s'agissoit entre les Grecs et les Troyens: c'etoit de la navigation de la mer Egee et du Pont Euxin, subjet beaucoup plus raisonnable et plus interessant: et la guerre ne se termina point par la prise de Troye, mais par un traite de commerce. Cela est meme assez fonde sur l'antiquite: mais de-la l'auteur se trouve conduit a un paradoxe plus surprenant; c'est que l'Iliade n'est qu'une pure histoire, alliegorisee dans le gout oriental. Ces Dieux, tant reproches a Homere, et qui pourraient l'empecher d'etre reconnu pour divin, sont pleinement justifie par un seul mot: ce ne sont point des dieux, ce sont des hommes et des nations." Eloge de Bianchini, (Euvres 7: 326. 29 He refers to some of their accounts in the Origine des fables, and describes others in the H.A. See J. R. Carre, ed., Fontenelle: De l'Origine des fables, Paris, 1932. as of artifacts provided the variable elements that were subject to change, and therefore were susceptible to treatment in the scientific manner. The fact that man's passions and potentiality for idiocy persisted constituted no stumbling block for Fon- tenelle, for the conditions that required the Renaissance to revive the stoic philosophy no longer obtained in his time. Those who have equated Fontenelle's attacks on ignorance with Montaigne's pessimism have failed to take into account that the two men were doing quite dissimilar things. Although the individual was Fon- tenelle's ultimate concern, his recognition of the fact that the mceurs of a society are determined by the ideas that are overlaid on the passions allowed him to give reality to the idea of social change. Furthermore, primitive curiosity and imagination are no less ingredi- ents of science than they are of fables. Moreover, Fontenelle's very concern for the individual gave added support to his social science, for it is only the individual who is able to apply the astringent of criticism to man's social inventions. In addition, such criticism must stem from the evidence of his senses and his own good sense, so that ultimately belief is defined as prejudice and the argument for social relativism is strengthened. This implication is clear not only for history but for the attack on superstition in his own time as well. The rules of evidence require that the cause be proportional to the effect, so that, when an astrologer in one of Fontenelle's plays refuses to allow his daughter to marry because of the appearance of a comet, he is reminded that it is hardly good sense to believe that a heavenly fire of that size is needed to warn against the marriage of two nobodies. The greater misfortune, the young lady in question argues, is the failure to accord her her heart's desire.30 However useful the tool of relativism was for criticiz- ing society, and Fontenelle availed himself of it in the Dialogues and the Entretiens, he was unwilling to push it to its logical extreme. Fontenelle never ceased to believe that the individual's sense perceptions were united to those of his fellows by a common body of knowledge that was available to all mankind. But the individual's skepticism could pierce through the veil of ignorance by demanding that the rules of evi- dence apply to the study of society as well as to that of nature. This is the first step in the creation of a social science. The second step is to accord a historical value to unreason that would allow one to trace the progress of knowledge as a function of society, i.e., as process, remembering that the social store of knowl- edge springs from the individual and returns to him to be manipulated by his passions. Ideas are never at home outside the sphere of human feeling, and the two together in interplay are what constitute the minurs of any given society. 30 La Comete, CEuvres 4.

The time dimension is already implicit in the latter work, so that it was simply a change of direction that enabled him to extrapolate its conclusions. Having stated the fact of social change, having described the necessary progress of civilizations, and having identified science by its method, which was unique because it could criticize itself, Fontenelle was in a position to define science and history as process as well as progress. If Fontenelle emphasized the distinctiveness of his own age in the Digression, he affirmed in the Origine des fables that it was not discontinuous from the past. To learn from the past and to be liberated from it was his hope for history. The sense of process coupled with a critical empiricism led him to a description of history in one of his fragments that can be assessed as a radical departure from Cartesian principles and the germ of the Voltairian position that was stated some fifty years later. While Fontenelle demanded of the writer of history that he assure himself of each fact before committing it to paper, he also required him to offer an explanation of it in the causal sense. Fontenelle likened the writing of history to the work of the scientists, although he recognized that the product was likely to be much less polished and more subject to reservation than the scientific hypothesis. The method of writing history, "resembles the way we devise a philosophic system. The philosopher has in front of him a certain number of natural effects and experiments. He must divine plausible causes, and, from what he sees and imagines, he composes an interrelated whole. There is your system." 31 Remembering that it was not society that interested Fontenelle, but the enlightened individual who was its best product, it is understandable that he then valued history as a means to perfecting our minds. Fontenelle spoke for the inductive method in history; but with little interest in the past beyond that of pro- viding a lesson for one present, history spoke to him as a source for moral improvement. What can and should be emphasized as a qualification to the latter attitude, which was after all characteristic of his age, is his in- 31 Sur l'Histoire, (Euvres 5: 430. See also his Eloge of Leibnitz for very much the same treatment of history. He described Leibnitz as having made, "de certaines reflexions generales, elevees au dessus de l'histoire meme; que, dans cet amas et confus et immense de faits, ils demelent un ordre et des liaisons delicates qui n'y sont que pour eux; que ce qui les interesse le plus, ce sont les origines des nations, de leurs langues, de leurs moeurs, de leurs opinions, surtout l'histoire de l'espece humaine et une succession de pensees qui naissent dans les peuples les unes apres les autres, et dont l'enchainement bien observe pourrait donner lieu a des especes de propheties." Eloge de Leibnitz, (Euvres 6: 460. sistence upon truth in history as the only proper means of extracting its moral. However, one must be cautious in evaluating Fon- tenelle's understanding of historical truth. It con- sisted, for him, almost exclusively of the general prin- ciple, so that the reader is led to wonder whether he did not allow himself to stress the moral principle at the expense of historical fact. He has stated that, "I believe that history is good for nothing if it is not allied with ethics." 32 But the question must be asked then, what is the moral to be derived from history? Fontenelle's answer was: "It is worth as much to learn about the court action of two bourgeois as it is about a war between two princes; I do not see that we derive more enlightenment from the one than the other." 33 Fontenelle spoke for a "new" history when he asked that the tastes, customs, the mceurs of any society be described and explained by the historian. Because the enlightened individual was his concern, he wanted to determine the conditions that made possible the appearance and continued fruitful activity of that new man. We can see that Fontenelle considered history in two contexts: the first as a mode of thought, in which he acknowledged the rules of evidence as the source for historical generalization, the second as the level of generalization itself which defined its usefulness. But if Fontenelle looked to history for examples of moral behavior, it should be recognized that the word morale has two connotations in the French language. Fon- tenelle considered it unnecessary to do more than look about himself for a picture of human morals, which, after all, remain constant. He was convinced, how- ever, that social morality had undergone marked im- provement with the passage of time. That the latter meaning of the word was what he intended is made clear when we recall, once again, that it was his effort to identify the social conditions which allowed for the progress of the intellect that motivated his study of society. We can say that Fontenelle came to his understanding of history by way of his experience with science. Fon- tenelle would have said of history, as he did of science, that it is indeed relative to the extent that it is an expression of ideas and not the chronicling of fact. Ideas spring from the human mind and are necessarily subjective, but it is hoped that they correspond, to a greater or lesser degree, to some objective reality. Fontenelle said that much about science, but he noted this difference between history and science: the latter achieves more concrete results as a consequence of its concern with fewer variables. If Fontenelle did not call history a science it was because he would have considered a science of human behavior impossible. The lack of any specific conclusion to be drawn from 32 Sur l'Histoire, (Euvres 5: 435. 33 Ibid., 434. 52 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="53">THE SOCIAL SCIENCES history prevented him from identifying the one body of knowledge with the other. But it is not a matter of uncertainty that he regarded history as a scientific discipline. His own activity as historian of the Academie des Sciences testifies to that fact. Moreover, Fontenelle viewed the methodology of history and of science as being identical. Here again he considered both disciplines as springing from the same source: human consciousness that is limited, to be sure, no matter how perfect its mental tools may become (and honesty required him to recognize that a non- metaphysical definition of certainty simply re-defined the area of doubt and error), but that is trustworthy as a source of knowledge. Although both disciplines are relative to the time and place in which they are carried out, and this is the meaning of his valuation of the fables, nevertheless caution must be exercised to guard against subjective relativism. There are insights more true than others as they reflect the superior critical judgment and imagination of a more humane time. Both science and history, Fontenelle believed, derived from human experience and had something to offer to it in return. He would not have accounted that history or that science true that pointed to an inhumane view of the world. Inasmuch as the search was of greater value to Fon- tenelle than the idea sought for, it was impossible for him to distinguish between science and history on the basis of objectivity. Fontenelle would have said, and indeed he implied as much, that to contrast the failure of history to provide positive gains with the success of science in the creation of inventions is to confuse science with technology. It is true that both dis- ciplines aspire to generalized statements of explana- tion that purport to say something about the relation- ship of the facts under consideration, but history is no more inadequate than science in its failure to say something that is at once true and complete. If science has committed the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, history is guilty of no worse than that when it focuses on one aspect of human behavior to the neglect of another. Moreover, if scientific truth is acknowledged to be less than absolute, we have every reason to be satisfied with the same state of affairs in history. Fontenelle asked only one question of history, as he did of science: what is the character, manner and meaning of its search? Does it provide us with true information, of a provisional kind it is true, but in- formation that has been arrived at empirically and that is designed to describe man's relation to society and to the universe for the sake of such knowledge itself, as answering man's need to know. It is clear that Fontenelle never abandoned the humanist view of things in any study that he undertook to formulate. Fontenelle's view of the historical discipline exercised a tremendous influence upon the eighteenth century, an influence acknowledged by his two worthy succes- sors, Montesquieu and Voltaire. But if Montesquieu followed Fontenelle's advice to seek for principles of explanation, the absence of a time sense in the Esprit des lois brings it closer to the ideals of sociology than to those of history. The sense of process that is so clearly evident in Fontenelle's most sociological work, the Origine des fables, seemed never to find a congenial home in Montesquieu's mind. By contrast, the greater attention that Voltaire paid to historical causality in his consideration of the general phenomena of civiliza- tion seemed to militate in his case against the formula- tion of principles of explanation that were anything but moralistic. Of course, Voltaire was the more sophisticated historian of the two, but even he, in his attachment to the Fontenellian idea of the progress of knowledge, neglected what Fontenelle knew to be im- portant to history, a just evaluation of the role of unreason in the process of history. However, we do not sense the more general but more important contribution that Fontenelle made to the social science of the eighteenth century until we open the Grande encyclopedie, when we are struck by the fact that the idea of progress had entered into the public consciousness to such a degree by mid-century that its meaning is often simply implied in the En- cyclopedie, even vulgarized. The detailed chronicle of scientific invention that is to be found in its volumes is eloquent testimony to the general awareness of social progress and the willingness, even eagerness, of the educated lay public to make contact with it. But the more general ideas that appear again and again throughout the Encyclopedie, that progress is based on similarity of the human endowment and the greater suitability of some civilizations, are more specifically Fontenelle's own. Indeed the authors acknowledge their debt to him by citing his first principle in the article on "Erudi- tion," and in citing his second in the one entitled "Prodige." However, a more explicit reference was made to Fontenelle in the article "Academies," where d'Alembert credited the perpetual secretary with teach- ing the world how to separate the true from the false in his Histoire de l'Academie, and where he declared his intention of using that work as a model of intellectual history for the Encyclopedie.34 It is possible to arrive at an even clearer picture of Fontenelle's contribution to the Encyclopedie if we make an effort to discern the essential humanist prin- ciples that guided it. It is true that its authors had a goal that was foreign to Fontenelle, the creation of an instrument for social propaganda. But in creating such an instrument, the principle of explanation that they professed rested on Fontenelle's ideas that the psy- chology of the individual, viewed pragmatically, must account for the slowness of social change, and that social change itself is a fact to be explained by the accumulated contributions made by individuals to society. Not the results of science but its method and 34 Grande encyclopedie 1: 252, Geneva, 1777. 53 VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959]</page><page sequence="54">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE its example provided the jumping-off place for such ideas. Without such a view of science, it is difficult to see how the time sense that is so necessary to history could have been developed. With this kind of at- tention to science, its essential humanist character could never be overlooked, -no matter how much em- phasis was placed on technological invention. In this connection it may be stated that the improvement of the intellect was never absent from the Encyclopedists' program for a better society. Indeed they considered the first a means to the second, simply using Fon- tenelle's valuation of knowledge as a guide to action. The importance of Fontenelle's social science cannot be over-emphasized in any study of his role as a philosopher of science. Conceiving of knowledge and society as functions of each other, he was able to con- struct out of his experience with science the principles of a new social science. The first of these principles is that properly defined such a science is indeed possible. The second principle is that we must go to the origins of society for an explanation of its subsequent be- havior, just as we go to nature to discern its laws. The third is that we must trace the variables of human behavior through time for a knowledge of the rules that govern change. It is true that all of this activity derived its value from the enlightenment that it af- forded the individual intellect, but Fontenelle was not without the hope that ultimately society might benefit indirectly from it. How Fontenelle conceived of the reciprocal roles of science and society, in a rather more specific sense, has been reserved as the subject of the next chapter. VIII. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Although Fontenelle was without a program for either science or society, he did prescribe a reciprocal relationship that he hoped would be to their mutual benefit. If ignorance had prevented the development of science in the past, then conversely the existence of science would help to dispel ignorance. The latter de- velopment would be cumulative in its effect, so that the social situation propitious to science would become increasingly available with the passage of time. More- over, Fontenelle thought it possible that the method and example of science might help to bring peace to the world, and a greater efficiency to the running of its governments. He entertained the latter ideas with all the reservations that he had expressed about man's susceptibility to enlightenment, but he did believe that science was a civilizing force, and that its values of skepticism, relativism, and pragmatism would have a humanizing effect upon society. Fontenelle's own effort to dispel a specific super- stition is illustrated by one of his best known works, the Histoire des oracles (1686). Popularizing an earlier work that had remained obscure because of its erudition, he turned with skepticism to the Christian belief that the oracles had been the work of demons and that they had ceased their activity with the coming of Christ. A careful use of the rules of evidence allowed him to uncover the source of the first belief in Plato, to point out that others had disagreed with him, to demonstrate that the oracles had their origins in perfectly natural situations, and to state with as- surance that they gradually disappeared in the manner of other social phenomena undergoing transformation. Although the belief in immediate cessation of the oracles was a matter of flattery to the early Christians, Fon- tenelle was willing to credit them with the purest motives in their acceptance of it. But the truth of their religion and the righteousness of their cause were no reasons for their supporting them with flimsy argu- ments. Rather it appeared to be a denigration of the true religion to advance it by superstition. Fon- tenelle's argument seems designed to cut both ways, against superstition and the True Religion. The His- toire des oracles is one of the earliest direct attacks upon entrenched theology in the name of free thought. Fontenelle did not leave himself uncovered, how- ever. Detailing his reasons for writing the history in an introduction that is at once an apology and the first of his arguments against the theory of demons, he said: "But Holy Scripture tells us nothing about oracles being delivered by demons, and so we are free to take sides in this matter. It is one of those questions which divine wisdom has judged sufficiently indifferent to abandon to our disputes."1 But Fontenelle had other reasons for disbelieving the theory, stemming from his desire for an honest religion. He argued that, if the oracles had been delivered by evil demons, God would have warned mankind against them, and against believing that there was anything divine in the false religions. Furthermore, it is dignifying the oracles to consider them demonic, relieving paganism of the onus of fraud, and thereby detracting from the ex- cellence of the Christian religion. Fontenelle described the pagan religions as a series of practices which required observance but not belief. The people were unable to recognize the impertinence of this state of affairs, and the elite were hardly bothered by it. One wonders at this point whether he did not mean to submit a criticism and a recom- mendation for his own contemporaries. We shall have occasion at the end of this section to assess Fontenelle's thought and inclinations in this matter, but at this point we may ask attention to the obvious implications of the following quotation: Also we see that the entirety of pagan religion required nothing but ceremony, and no sentiment of the heart. The gods are irritated; all their shafts of lightning are ready to fall. How will we appease them? Must we repent of the crimes we have committed? Must we enter into the ways of natural justice which should exist among all men ? Not at all. We are only required to take a calf 1 Fontenelle, L'Histoire des oracles, (Euvres 2: 303. 54 [TRANS.

Habit has the kind of influence on men that has no need of being supported by reason.2 "Sentiments of the heart," "Natural justice among men," these are the words of an eighteenth-century deist, and a criticism of the practice of revealed religion, which would be the first to insist that belief, not senti- ment, duty to God, not justice among men, are the conditions of first importance. But why did the people subscribe to such a religion? Why were they susceptible to gods and oracles? One kind of god, the "divine" variety, was announced by the sages with a great deal of mystery, and mystery excites interest. The other kind, the elevation to divinity of public heroes, stemmed from the love of the people, and that is an even more powerful force than mystery. But these two motivations do not explain the popularity of the oracles. Of course time will hallow the most ridiculous institution, but its origin must be sought in the human addiction to the falsely marvelous, and its persistence must be explained by human cupidity and the passion for certainty or foreknowledge. Thus Fontenelle gives a plausible reconstruction of events. There was a hole on Parnassus from which an exhala- tion was given off that made goats dance and that went to the head. Perhaps someone who was inebriated by it began talking without knowing what he said and said something true. Immediately it was believed that there was something divine in this exhalation; it contained the science of the future. People began approaching the hole with respect; little by little ceremonies formed. Appar- ently this is how the Delphic oracle was born, and since it owed its origin to an inebriating exhalation, the priestess was required to enter into a fury in order to prophesy. Among the majority of other oracles this fit was unneces- sary. For if you have one established you may believe that many others will follow. If the gods speak there, why not here? The people, struck by the wonder of the thing, and avid for the utility they hope from it, are satisfied to see oracles born everywhere, and thus antiquity hit upon all these oracles, guaranteeing their success. New ones were not so successful; it was the princes who established them. The people prefer to believe in the ones they devise themselves. Add to that that in the time of the first gods and oracles ignorance was much greater than it was afterwards. Phi- losophy was not born yet, and the most extravagant super- stition had nothing to fear from it.3 Not even the manifest contradictions of the oracles, nor their failure to prophesy accurately could dissuade the people from their belief. The quality of their faith was indeed admirable. But if the behavior of the people was naive, the same could not be said for the oracles themselves. They 2 Ibid., 347. 3 Ibid.. 370. knew what they were about, and they overlooked no possibility for safeguarding their position. Their tricks should have been obvious to all but the unintelligent. They played for time, drew out their subjects, gathered information about them, and relied on the material interests of the inhabitants of the area to support them in their endeavors. The Delphic oracle, for example, was the only source of revenue for the people in that locality. If any impious soul had dared to pierce the mystery with which the oracles surrounded themselves and point out the obvious fraud, he would have been declared an atheist, and the people would surely have made short shrift of him. There seems always to be an alliance between the deceivers and the deceived, a partnership in greed and dishonesty. Being all too human, the oracles disappeared only when the other institutions of paganism did so too, except when the Christians had the power to ban them outright. It is impossible to believe the tales of their immediate cessation, Fontenelle declared, especially the tale of an oracle who was struck dumb at the birth of Christ, and then declared his new state of muteness to the world. There is direct evidence for the persistence of the oracles, and indirect evidence to suggest that they suffered a gradual decline during the first few centuries A.D. Fontenelle pointed to the fact that the oracles were delivered less in verse with the passage of time, and were consulted more and more about relatively mundane affairs, a sign to him of the gradual degenera- tion of the institution. Only an inattention to the most elementary rules of evidence could have enabled the early Christians to believe in the cessation of the oracles, just as the pagans in a similar state believed in their efficacy. The question of evidence is central to the Histoire des oracles. Fontenelle found reasons to explain primi- tive belief, but it was his hope that a more reasonable age would discard such superstition. He made his point in an early part of the Histoire when he said, These two authorities are not equal. The testimony of those who believe in the status quo has no strength to support it; but the testimony of those who disbelieve it has the strength to destroy it. .... It is altogether the op- posite when a new thing appears; the testimony of those who believe it is by itself stronger than the testimony of those who do not.4 The author explained that it was not the authority of one or the other party that was decisive, but that if one disregarded the reasons on which both parties based their authority, then the rule just quoted would obtain. For in order to abandon an accepted opinion or to embrace a new one, one must exercise his reason, whereas the reverse procedure calls for no such activity. The exercise of one's reason, however, does not guar- antee the correctness of its conclusions. Among those who hold to their prejudices, Fontenelle charged the 4 Ibid., 274 ff. VOL. 49, PT. 7. 1959] 55</page><page sequence="56">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE philosophers with being the worst offenders, for they sustain them with a variety of false reasoning that assumes all the prestige of intellectuality. It is germane to our discussion, at this point, to ask why Fontenelle should have felt it necessary to refute a belief that had for a long time failed to excite interest or adherence. Why did he choose to rewrite a piece of erudite scholarship in such a way as to make it into a document for his own time? The implication is present from our foregoing discussion that Fontenelle intended his work to be an attack on contemporary Christian superstition. Indeed, one author has sug- gested that if the word "miracles" is substituted for "oracles," then the meaning of the history is made clear.5 It is clear from everything else that he said on the subject that Fontenelle considered the Church's toleration of superstition and insistence on dogmatic theology to be a hindrance to the pursuit of truth, and that he expected science to challenge both activities for its own good and for the good of religion. The char- acter and intention of Fontenelle's work is evidenced by the kind of response that it provoked. Le Pere Baltus attacked the Histoire des oracles after it ap- peared, saying in part, Tell the truth, Monsieur, have you not felt some re- pugnance . . . to proving that the oracles did not cease at the coming of the Savior of the world? It is rude of a Christian to feel himself obliged to lessen the glory of the one he recognizes as his God, and to deny, contrary to his feeling, that it is to Him that he owes the happiness of being delivered from the shadows of paganism and the tyranny of the demon. You will tell me perhaps that you believed you had to sacrifice all these repugnances to the truth, which ought to override all other considerations. The pretext is specious .. . Nothing could be a clearer description of the two varieties of mentality that were set in opposition: the one for whom empirically demonstrated truth was un- important, the other for whom it was all important. Fontenelle certainly did mean to let truth carry the field. Viewed in one light we are not surprised that Fon- tenelle should have been a free thinker when we remember that there was a long line of libertins in France whose existence and activity Professor Perrens has documented. Viewed in another light, what is distinctive about Fontenelle's free thought is the sub- stance and method of science with which he filled it. Montaigne and Gassendi were never without followers in France, but those who followed on the heels of the essayist tended to be either esprits forts or bitter critics after the fashion of Bayle. But Fontenelle was not a Baylean, neither in outlook nor in temperament. He was the very last person to have wanted a fight with the Church; but what is more significant than the fact 5 Levy-Bruhl, History of modern philosophy in France, Chi- cago, 1896. 6 Baltus, (Pere), Reponse a l'histoire des oracles, as quoted by Louis Maigron, Fontenelle, Histoire des oracles, 248, Paris, 1908. of his prudence is that he was not a doctrinaire anti- clerical. Fontenelle had more than a measure of belief, and was completely dedicated to the idea of balance that he insisted was true and necessary to the happiness and well-being of man. In the manner of St. Thomas, and many who came after him, Fontenelle believed that religion and science were not inconsistent.7 He hoped that theology could keep abreast of civilization, and, if it did not, he intended to prod it. A more enlightened age should rid religion of superstition, intolerance, dogmatism, and prejudice. Religion itself would not suffer from their absence, Fontenelle would have argued, for its essential in- gredients are an imaginative faith and emotion. The latter is necessary to a sincere adherence to morality; the former does not eschew revelation, but only the logical deductions from it that dogmatic theology makes. Fontenelle believed that imagination was not absent from science; neither was faith nor morality, as I have attempted to demonstrate in a preceding chapter. Conversely, science, at its highest level, was an ex- pression of the religious impulse, perhaps even a variety of it, no less without mystery than religion. It was not deism that Fontenelle espoused, after all, but a purified Catholicism.8 Fontenelle very properly valued the relatedness of science and religion and knew of clerics who did so too. If there were some like Pere Baltus whose definition of faith left no room for thought, there were others like Pere Buffier who shared Fontenelle's valuation of it. Moreover, Fontenelle at- tacked not only mindlessness, but the perverted direc- tions of mind, to be found outside as well as in the Church. Ideas falsely held and propagated were the only devil's disciples that Fomtenelle recognized. Con-. versely, no institutions, either lay or ecclesiastical, offered any hope to man if it did not allow him the free exercise of his mind. 7 Fontenelle appreciated the genius and contribution of St. Thomas, and declared that in other times and circumstances he could have substituted for Descartes. "II [Marsigli] donna a cette imprimerie le nom d'imprimerie de Saint Thomas d'Aquin, dont il invoquoit la protection pour cet etablissement et pour tout l'institut. Le protecteur etoit bien choisi, car Saint Thomas, dans un autre siecle et dans d'autres circon- stances, etoit Descartes." Eloge de Marsigli, (Euvres 7: 387. 8 This writer is convinced that Fontenelle was sincere in his religious convictions, and that those convictions were of the traditional Roman Catholic variety. This conclusion is reached by way of his numerous references to religion which I have alluded to in preceding chapters. If it is a sound conclusion, it should help to correct the impression formed of Fontenelle as a charming, but cynical hypocrite. Clearly this was the opinion of many of his eulogists in the eighteenth century, Mme de Tencin, Geoffrin, and others whose remarks have been given currency by a succession of critics, the latest being Herbert Butterfield in The origins of modern science. Free thinker that he was, it should be remembered that Fontenelle was of a generation that felt the effects of a religious revival, and that, possessed of religious belief as well as human feelings, as an honnete homme he was no more likely to wear the one on his sleeve than the other. 56 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="57">SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Such a freedom was possible, Fontenelle thought, because social morality and values had improved with time, and the science that had improved them provided the opportunity to dispose of prejudice, dogmatism, and intolerance. These may have been crutches necessary to man's early development, but they were needed no longer. The world had been made safe for variety of belief. If this seems like a guarded way to state Fontenelle's belief in relativism, then it must be pointed out that he held this belief no more absolutely than he did any other. Although he had a continual interest in the accounts of visitors to foreign parts, and used the information to criticize his own society, he never succumbed to the myth of the noble savage that his successors developed and seemed eager to believe. Fon- tenelle valued the achievements of his civilization too highly to mistake the primitive simplicity of the savage for social accomplishment. It was only the sentimental- ist or the misguided supporter of science who might hope that simplicity of behavior could be grafted onto a technological civilization. Moreover, Fontenelle was not to be taken in by the vogue for the exotic. Like the child in the story of the emperor's clothes, he ap- praised the Siamese ambassadors to Paris, in a manner that did justice to the foreigner as well as the French. Surprise and admiration have so much effect as to make us value things at more than they are worth. Paris has collected the notable words of the Siamese ambassadors and all of Paris has applauded them. If the Spanish or English ambassadors had said the same, we would have thought no more about it. But we suppose that people coming from the other side of the world, dark- skinned, dressed differently from us, whom the Europeans had treated as barbarians, could not have any common sense. We have been astonished to find that they have it, and the least thing on their part occasions our admiration, an admiration which is at bottom quite insulting to them.9 Such good sense never deserted Fontenelle. He has been accused of cowardice for failing to join the battle against l'infdme, but if it is true that he valued his comfort, it is also true that he reserved his enthusiasm for the truth. Although the Siamese were not bar- barians, Fontenelle would have considered it unthink- able to value their civilization above his own. The perpetual secretary certainly believed in the "vanity of dogmatizing," and the necessity for tolerance. He did so, first of all, because, like Montaigne, he believed that unsure knowledge is no sound basis for burning one's neighbor. But his approach to the prob- lem had a more positive side as well. He was con- vinced that the way to truth was assisted by divergent opinion, and so any extraneous consideration that acted to limit the easy exchange of ideas was by definition a false criterion for action. Thus, according to Maury, Fontenelle must have regretted the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, not only for its explicit intolerance, but also for the fact that it accounted for the departure 9 Discours sur l'eglogue, (Euvres 5: 28. of Huygens and discouraged Hartsoeker and Leibnitz from going to France. Recognizing the need for inter- national cooperation in science, Fontenelle worried on at least one occasion that the recurrent wars between England and France would strain the relationship be- tween their respective scientists.10 On another oc- casion, in an exchange of letters, the correspondents affirmed their loyalty to both land and letters and expressed the hope that the governments could learn from their respective academies to live in peace."1 Such a state of mutual toleration would be a desirable out- come of science, Fontenelle believed, and entirely pos- sible as a consequence of the improvement it had made in social morality. However, with the individual and not society before his eyes, Fontenelle entertained no project for perpetual peace or social improvement based on science. Rather he sought the more pragmatic solution of keeping science free from political influences. Therefore, it was probably out of conviction as well as temperament that Fontenelle was a conservative in government. As dissatisfaction with the ancien regime grew during the latter part of his life, he participated less and less in the mounting chorus of criticism. It goes without saying that the philosophes were thinking not so much of revolution as of reform. Even so, Fontenelle showed very little interest in the latter, if indeed he had ever been inclined in that direction. It may be that his conservatism was reinforced with age, but even in his youth his criticisms had been directed less at institutions than at specific institutional prac- 10 Speaking of the cooperation between Du Fay and Gray in their work on electricity, Fontenelle said: "Ils s'eclairerent, ils s'animerent mutuellement et arriverent ensemble 'a des de- couvertes si surprenantes et si inouies, qu'ils avoient besoin de s'en attester et de s'en confirmer l'un a l'autre la verite; il falloit, par exemple, qu'ils se rendissent reciproquement temoig- nage d'avoir vu l'enfant devenu lumineux pour avoir ete electrise. Pourquoi l'exemple de cet Anglois et de ce Franqois qui se sont avec tant de bonne foi et si utilement accordes dans une meme recherche, ne pourroit il pas etre suivi en grand par l'Angleterre et par la France? Pourquoi s'eleve-t-il entre les deux nations des jalousies, qui n'ont d'autre effet que d'arreter, ou au moins de retarder les progres des sciences?" Eloge de Du Fay, (Euvres 7: 527. 11 The letters were exchanged in 1744 between Fontenelle and Mr. Lockman of England. The latter writes: "Les changemens politiques arrives dans le monde depuis ce tems, n'ont aucune influence sur le sentiment vif que j'ai toujours conserve des obligations que je vous ai. Ceux qui n'ignorent pas que les academies conservent entr'elles une intime correspondance malgre l'inimitie que la guerre peut causer entre les nations dont elles font parties, ne me croiront pas moins bon Anglois." Fontenelle replied: "Je fais gloire d'etre un peu Anglois, puisque la societe royale de Londres, a bien voulu me recevoir dans son ilustre corps; mais je n'en suis que plus afflige de la guerre qui est entre les deux nations. Que ne sont elles aussi raisonnables que nos academies! Mais c'est ce souhait-la lui- meme qui n'est pas raisonnable. La nature humaine ne com- porte pas qu'il ait jamais lieu." (Euvres 8: 314, 321. It is an interesting reflection on the state of political development in the two countries that the Englishman felt the political question more keenly than Fontenelle whose first loyalty seemed to be to the republic of letters. 57 VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959]</page><page sequence="58">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE tices. Thus in his eloge of Vauban, he had implied a criticism of governmental practice when he suggested that Vauban's habit of collecting data on the state of the nation would be a useful habit for the monarchy to learn if it intended to provide the country with the benefits of good government. In the latter part of the Sun-king's reign, Fontenelle joined the many others who were carefully criticizing Louis for his excessive warfare. However, it would never have occurred to the academician to change the character of the mon- archy, much less dispense with it altogether. Of course Fontenelle was himself part of the old regime, but the pragmatic method of change recommended itself to him apart from that fact. Having sensed its usefulness in science, he believed it would have equal value in society. He believed as a corollary to this that, if nature is essentially in harmony with itself, then there must be a basic harmony among men too. In Fontenelle's case this thought worked to guard against radical change rather than to promote it. However, there is a larger context in which Fon- tenelle's pragmatism should be viewed. The social and intellectual ideals that constituted his humaneness would have militated against his becoming anything so one- sided as a reformer. Stated positively, those same ideals required him to live the life of a whole man, within society and not outside its existing social fabric. For example, he thought it entirely possible, in his eloge of Newton, that the same individual could be both a scientist and a man of affairs. After all, politics is a delicate business, and the mind accustomed to making fine distinctions in science should find a con- genial atmosphere in the realm of government.'2 More- over, the balanced man is useful to science when it comes to persuading a reluctant government to part with some of its funds. This attitude is revealed with such delicate clarity in his eloge of Du Fay, that I shall quote from it at length. But no amount of activity would have sufficed to execute in so short a time all his plans for the garden [Jardin du Roi] if he had used only the funds normally destined for this establishment. He had to obtain, and obtain frequently, extraordinary benefits from the court. Hap- pily, he was well known by the ministers; he had easy access to them, and a liberty and familiarity with them which a soldier or man of the world comes by more easily than a simple academician. Moreover, he knew how to conduct himself with the ministers, to set the stage for his requests, to make them only at the appropriate moment, to accept with good grace the first refusal (almost certain to be made), return to the task only in calm moments, free from clouds. Finally, he had the gift of pleasing 12 "Apres tout, c'est peut-etre une erreur de regarder les sciences et les affaires comme si incompatibles, principalement pour les hommes d'un certaine trempe. Les affaires politiques bien entendues se reduisent elles-memes a des calculs tres fins, et a des combinaisons delicates, que les esprits accoutumes aux hautes speculations saisissent plus facilement et plus surement, des qu'ils sont instruits des faits, et fournis des materiaux necessaires." Eloge de Newton, (Euvres 7: 283. them, and that is a great help in persuading; but they also knew that they had nothing to fear from his art which tended only to useful ends and glory for them- selves.13 Fontenelle was clearly at home in the world of aristo- cratic government. If he criticized the government for failing to support science properly (he concurred in Reaumur's plea for additional funds), he viewed that problem as one to be solved in the traditional manner of personal contact. He would not have understood legislation as a means of supporting science. Although the aristocracy was sometimes indifferent to science, the people were likely to be entirely ignorant of its purpose and activity. One could count on a certain number of enlightened minds among the elite who could appreciate the value of science even if they did not fully understand it. It is surely a little difficult to reconcile the foregoing attitude with another that we have described which criticized the aristocracy and lauded the bourgeois who constituted the majority in the Academie des Sciences. Much has been made of the latter fact to insist that Fontenelle was speaking for the rising class in France and perhaps consciously preparing for that intellectual revolution that preceded the political one. It is true that he often described the aristocracy as lazy and useless to science, and often praised the men of middle class origin for their patience, industry, and honesty. But surely he was praising the latter in their capacity as scientists. There is no doubt that Fontenelle meant to say that the bourgeoisie was more susceptible to the high morality of science than the aristocracy, but it is also clear that the morality of science was elevated above the level of bourgeois profit-seeking. Both the aristocrat and the bourgeois could transform himself into' the new man of science if he had the capacity and the inclination to do so. Fontenelle's real concern with the bourgeoisie and aristocracy as such was simply to explain to them the new men of science in the hope that the latter would receive fair treatment at the hands of both. Without intending to minimize the political struggles that were beginning to develop in France or the part that science was to play in an industrial and bourgeois civilization, I think it only proper, in view of the fore- going statements, to question some of the extant ideas about the relationship between the bourgeoisie and science, science and the Protestant ethic. Some scholars have argued for the causal connection between the growth of English science and the utilitarian attitude of Protestantism.14 The utilitarian motive can be over- emphasized, as I have already suggested, but assuming its strength how are we to explain the flourishing state of science in Catholic France. Of course the French 13 Eloge de Du Fay, (Euvres 7: 532. 4 Merton, R. K., Science, technology and society in seven- teenth-century England, Osiris 4: 1938. Herbert Butterfield, The origins of modern science, 141. 58 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="59">CONCLUSION government itself was not without a utilitarian interest in science, but just as soon as we consider the govern- ment, we are talking about another matter, and one that complicates the problem. Let us begin, therefore, with the Protestant context. It is assumed by R. K. Merton, presumably on the evidence presented by Tawney and Weber, that there is a close tie between Protestantism and the "rising middle class," and it is further assumed that the latter class, in its never-ending rise, must inevitably come in- to conflict with an authoritarian government. But it is a fact that the bourgeoisie in France was much less inclined to quarrel with its government than its English counterpart. Of course it was smaller in number than the English middle class, and quite effectively barred from real political power, but on the basis of the pre- vious assumption it is hard to see how science could have developed in France until its revolution had occurred. Clearly, Merton's statements, based on his examination of the English experience, do not apply to the French. Science flourished with equal success in pre-revolutionary Catholic France and in post- revolutionary Protestant England. Perhaps it will be concluded that science can develop under differing conditions, or, if it is assumed that the conditions that assisted its development must be the same everywhere, then perhaps a different set of pre-conditions must be established. There is a different set of conditions, common to both countries, and much more specific in context, that can be cited to explain the phenomenon of parallel growth. Of primary importance is the fact that both govern- ments had sufficient interest in science to encourage its endeavors, in the case of France, with government subsidies, in that of England, with awards and prizes. Without such support it is difficult to see how medicine, physics, and astronomy could have flourished as they did. Furthermore, plebeian and aristocrat came to- gether in both countries in the pursuit of science, and it would seem that a new elite was in process of forming that was unconnected with social rank in either land. Neither the English nor the French government, nor any of its auxiliary institutions like the Church, im- posed serious restrictions upon the freedom to investi- gate. It is true that the English had an easier time of it in this regard than the French, but Frenchmen were never halted in their activity by the censorship. This is especially true of the savants who, unlike the philosophes, were by and large content to respect religion, or, when they did not, to be able to distinguish successfully between religion and theology. Rather more of the opposition to science was to be found in the universities than in the Church, but inasmuch as the Academie des Sciences was a protected organ of the government any attack on it proved ultimately ineffectual. Therefore, it seems to this writer that apart from considerations inherent in the disciplines, the growth of science in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is to be explained, in part, by government interest and government-encouraged freedom. From all the avail- able evidence the governments were motivated to be- have so by the benefits they hoped to derive from the utility and prestige of science. Obviously, it does not lie within the scope of this work to consider the long- range social, economic, even religious factors that helped to produce this state of affairs. A history of western Europe would naturally insist on them as causative agents when it considered the seventeenth century. However, in the more specific context in which we have to discuss science, it is clear that the French achievement as portrayed by its chief apologist was only slightly less vital and productive than the English. Both governments may have viewed the utility of science as of primary importance. However, for the scientist as Fontenelle has described him, science served itself, first of all, then its practitioners, and finally it served the state. The French scientist was not averse to serving an authoritarian state, providing his freedom to investigate and his attachment to pure science were respected. This writer is not willing to say that the anti-authoritarianism of science failed to contribute to the intellectual revolution that preceded the political one. It certainly contributed to weakening the control that theology had previously exercised over thought. But it is hoped that the example of Fontenelle and French science has challenged the idea that "Protes- tant freedom" was somehow necessary to science, or that French absolutism was alien to it. The spokes- man for science was very likely more at home in his own society and climate of opinion than he would have been in our more positivistic, technological civilization. IX. CONCLUSION If this work has made its point, it will have helped to correct in some measure the too facile characterization of Fontenelle as a popularizer of science. The latter term is used not only to describe an activity, but to evaluate a man who has been considered by many to be a bel esprit equipped to do little but banter about science in a way calculated to please a frivolous, aristo- cratic society. However, we have seen that from the sixteen-eighties, when Fontenelle first entered the scientific circles of Paris, to 1741, when he retired as secretary of the Academy, Fontenelle played a leading role as interpreter of science not only to the lay public but to the scientists themselves. What manner of man was this who performed no experiments, practiced no science, but was entrusted to speak for science and whose pronouncements were accorded interest and respect ? He was possessed, first of all, of a wide range of knowledge accumulated during the course of a very long lifetime, knowledge about a variety of subjects that omitted none of the sciences. Fontenelle truly VOL. 49, PT. 7, 1959] 59</page><page sequence="60">MARSAK: BERNARD DE FONTENELLE knew the sciences. Doubtless he was unfamiliar with the details of some, but the Histoire de l'Academie gives concrete evidence of his grasp of the essential principles of all of them. No one could have written about them with the degree of clarity and precision that he displayed without a clear comprehension of the subject matter concerned. Moreover, of even greater importance was Fontenelle's understanding of the meaning and method of science which is revealed in his description of its unity and purpose. Those who have tended to look upon the perpetual secretary with favor have recognized this last fact and concluded that Fontenelle was in some sense an appreciator of science; perhaps connoisseur is the better word. If the act of criticism is implied in the word con- noisseur, nevertheless it carries the further implication of dilettantism. However, Fontenelle's role in science was not that of an amateur, but of a professional participant in the life of science, whose familiarity with it and whose influence upon it have already been discerned. I should prefer to call him a critic and philosopher of science, who in the former capacity fulfilled the function, unique to himself, of giving form to science in the period of its adolescence. How else can we define the act of appreciation that involved the search for the sense, meaning, values, and manner of the scientific enterprise? If the term critic seems strange to us in this connection, that may be because we have lost the sense of science that the eighteenth century possessed, and because science since that time has grown far too specialized for the lay person to criticize. The task of evaluating the contribution of science to thought has fallen to the philosopher in our day, and he has grown progressively more uneasy in this role since the classic age when science itself was called the "New Philosophy." Fontenelle displayed no such uneasiness when he functioned in the capacity of a philosopher, and as- suredly he did so when he considered the implications of science for epistemology, when he raised questions about the ultimate value and purpose of science. It need not be argued, I think, that the emphasis that Fontenelle placed upon science as an achievement of the mind lifts his idea of progress out of the category of the booster's scheme. Simply noting once again that progress as he defined it was a matter of the intellect, we are convinced that Fontenelle was con- cerned with the obvious task of the philosopher, the delineation of a world view that would encompass the different areas of human experience. Professor Butter- field goes further when he ascribes to the spokesman for science the responsibility for "the translation of the scientific achievement into a new view of life and of the universe." 1 That such was the creation of the eighteenth century has been affirmed by too many scholars for me to enumerate, nor do I need to point 1 Butterfield, H., The origins of modern science, 149. out that this new view of life was the foundation for our own. Although I agree with this point of view and affirm Fontenelle's contribution to the new creation, I should like to speak for the persistence of the old in his thought. What strikes the author as being of great significance in Fontenelle's case is that the task of criticizing and interpreting science to his contemporaries should have been entrusted to a literary man, and one who believed that literature had assisted in the development of his scientific capacities. Even more noteworthy was the reception accorded his work, doubtless as warm as it was because of the excellence of its literary qualities. It does not follow from this that his was the work of popularization or even interpretation, for we are concerned at this moment not with the numbers who read him or the climate favorable to science which he helped to create, but with a characteristic historical phenomenon in which the new is inevitably presented in terms of the old. Of course this happened because science derived from a previous civilization before it proceeded to fashion a new one, but also because the older one had much to recommend it; even though the scientists and philosophes argued against the past, not all of them were eager to dispose of its values. On the contrary, it was those values that gave meaning to science beyond what it could produce for the relief of man's estate. Fontenelle shared in this attitude; indeed, he was its chief spokesman. To be sure he recognized the distinctly new contribution that science could make to thought and life, making it the basis for his idea of progress, but he never severed the connection with his roots in life and thought as some of the materialist philosophes did. He refused to do so out of conviction as well as feeling. For one thing, he believed that the historical develop- ment of science linked it with the humanities with which he found it to be consistent. For another, Fon- tenelle shared none of the facile optimism of the eighteenth-century philosophe who believed in the un- limited perfectibility of man. Although social morality could improve with civilization, he believed that the morals of the individual would remain the same for- ever. Just so long as man's passions directed him would his perversity inflict evil upon the world. The tragic view of life that is found in Pascal and returned to us by Dostoievsky is the source of Fontenelle's pessimism. It would be a mistake, however, to overemphasize or misunderstand Fontenelle's pessimism. If man is a reed, bending in every direction before the gusts of his passions, he is still, as Pascal described him, a thinking reed. If Fontenelle viewed the promise of science with something less than complete optimism, nevertheless he valued its achievement as an expression of man's highest mental aspiration, the pursuit of truth. More- over, he discerned a value in the practice of science that allowed him to attach a high morality to it. Attributes 60 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

FONTENELLE Twelve editions of the 7Euvres diverses of Fon- tenelle appeared before his death, the first one being published in Amsterdam in 1701. Of that number five more were printed in Holland, either in Amsterdam or at The Hague, and two in London. A new edition of ten volumes was published in Paris in 1758, but it was probably in preparation before the death of the author, and is certainly incomplete. Since that time we have had five more editions of the CEuvres: 12 vols. at Amsterdam, chez Francois Changuion, 1764, in which the Memoires of the Abbe Trublet appear for the first time; 12 vols. at Paris, Les Libraires As- socies, 1767, which is considered to be the first definitive edition of the Works; 8 vols. at Paris, chez Bastien, 1790, without doubt the best edition of all; 3 vols. at Paris, Belin, 1818, compact and including the apoc- rypha; and 5 vols. at Paris, Salmon, 1825, generally considered to be poor. The author has used the 1790 edition, which includes in addition to Fontenelle's works letters that he ex- changed with various correspondents, and a collection of the eulogies that were pronounced on the occasion of his death. The remaining portion of his work is to be found in the Histoire de l'Academie des Sciences depuis son etablissement en 1666 jusqu'a 1686, Paris, 1733 (from 1666 to 1679 by Fontenelle); L'Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences depuis 1686 jusqu'a son renouvellement en 1699, Paris, 1733; and the Histoire de l'Acadeimie Royale des Sciences, 1699- 1740.
