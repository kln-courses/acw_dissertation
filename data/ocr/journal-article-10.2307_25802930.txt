<plain_text><page sequence="1">TAYEB EL-HIBRI THE IMAGE OF THE CALIPH AL-WATHIQ: A RIDDLE OF RELIGIOUS AND HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE The 'Abbasid caliph al-Wathiq (r. A.H. 227-232/A.D. 841-845) is not the most well known of the medieval Islamic caliphs, and historians can be hard pressed to find any significant material about his life and rule in the classical chronicles. Still, the eighteenth-century writer, William Beckford (1760-1844), an English notable with a reputation for eccentricity and obssession with eastern mystery tales, managed to make this caliph the subject of a full length novel.1 His fictional work, Vathek, was written in French and translated into English in 1786. Like much romanticized writing about the east, it is filled with flourishes of fantasy, typical of western currents at the time that drew on the Arabian Nights for supplementing historical knowledge on life under the medieval caliphate. From a historian's point of view, however, Vathek is unique, firstly because it is one of the earliest focused works of orientalist writing on an eastern theme, and even more because its writer shows a certain knowledge about the caliph that sometimes comes very close to a few images of the caliph provided in the primary sources, most significantly those of Tabari and Mas'udl. 1 William Beckford was descended from a family that had amassed a fortune from sugar plantations in the West Indies. The family, originally clothworkers and of standard means, emigrated in 1660 to Jamaica and quickly rose to power, bringing Beckford's grandfather to the position of Lieutenant Governor of the island. Beckford's father, Peter, known as the Alderman, later moved back to London, entered politics and became twice the Lordmayor of London. His marriage into a Scottish aristocratic family with royal kinship ties gave this otherwise uncouth and semi-literate Alderman a social standing he clearly lacked, but it was his own family fortune that got him known as the richest subject of England. The author of Vathek grew up in the family's mansion at Fonthill Abbey, which was the site of famous evening parties that eventually inspired the novel's settings. For information on William Beckford, readers can be referred to a continuing stream of biographies about this author, mostly flourishing in England. Among the more notable of these works are: Cyrus Redding, Memoirs of William Beckford of Fonthill, Author of Vathek, 2 vols., London: Charles J. Skeet, 1859; Lewis Melville, Life and Letters of William Beckford, London: Heinemann, 1910; J. W.

QSA, 19 (2001), pp. 41-60</page><page sequence="2">This becomes especially remarkable when we consider that the latter works did not become edited and available to a western audience until the nineteenth century. Perhaps the most captivating image in Beckford's book occurs at the outset, where he describes his subject as follows: Vathek, ninth caliph of the race of the Abbasides [sic], was the son of Motassem, and the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid. From an early accession to the throne, and the talents he possessed to adorn it, his subjects were induced to expect that his reign would be long and happy. His figure was pleasing and majestic: but when he was angry, one of his eyes became so terrible, that no person could bear to behold it; and the wretch upon whom it was fixed, instantly fell backward, and sometimes expired. For fear, however, of depopulating his dominions, and making his palace desolate, he but rarely gave way to his anger.^ While the fantasy in Beckford's statement is apparent, one cannot but marvel that the author chose to focus on al-Wathiq's eye.3 It is unlikely that this choice was randomly made, and the passage becomes even more intriguing when we consider that a number of historical sources contain anecdotes that focus on this caliph's eye. These physical descriptions of the caliph generally note that he had a white spot in his eye (nukta or nuktat baydd),4 although they do not say if it affected his vision. Nor do they associate this feature per se with any terrifying qualities. In this study, I will examine why a number of anecdotes concerning "the hard gaze" (the so called "oeil si terrible" that Beckford spoke of) are associated with al-Wathiq. And I will try to place this phenomenon within a literary-historical context that explains the origin of this unique depiction in connection with the controversies of the Mihna, a program that al Wathiq continued ?taking the torch from al-Ma'mOn and al-Mu'tasim? with great vigor. 2 William Beckford, Vathek: An Arabian Tale, repr. Philadelphia, 1854, p. 2. 3 Modern biographers of Beckford have speculated that the author's fascination with "Vathek" and the contrast with "Motassem" was inspired by a possible comparison he saw to himself and his father, the Alderman. The same tempestuous, authoritarian style characterized both the Beckfords and the myth of the 'Abbasids, while the contrast between an intolerant poorly educated father and a hedonistic yet creative son related (in a selective and rearranged manner) both pairs of personalities. The hard gaze of al Wathiq has been seen as in essence an evocation by Beckford of his father's, although other qualities in al-Wathiq, such as party indulgence and inspired poetry and song, the author probably reserved for himself.

He was one of the few caliphs who had a singular, undiluted designation to succession by his father.5 Despite his relative youth (29 years old) at the time of his succession, al-Wathiq was able to command the loyalty of the burgeoning military of Samarra'. He was helped by the fact that he continued the two key policies of his predecessors, namely the new military policy of relying on the Turkish corps and the religious policy of enforcing the Mihna.6 In one of these areas, that of the Mihna, al-Wathiq continued enforcing the doctrine of the Mu'tazila most likely out of his belief in the method of speculative theology (kalam current) that the Mu'tazila espoused in their argument with the circles of hadlth scholars.7 Tabarl and the early sources provide very little information as to why al-Wathiq chose to continue this policy. However, brief mentions in the sources portray him as a man of letters and rational debate, one very much in the tradition of al-Ma'mun. Some sources dub him "the little Ma'mun" ("al-Ma'mun al-saghlr"),8 stating that al-Ma'mun himself took charge of supervising al-Wathiq's education in his youth, even to the point of teaching him calligraphy and Qur'anic recitation. Ibn al-TmranT adds that al-Ma'mun advised his brother to raise his son Harun (al-Wathiq) without censure or restriction ("an la yu'addibahu"), saying that he "should be allowed to be as he is."9 5 Ibn al-Tmrani, al-Inbd' fi Ta'rlkh al-Khulaf d\ ed.

While al-Ma'mun was viewed as having been skilled in the ancient sciences ('Urn al-awd'il) ? identified as medicine, astronomy, and logic ? al-Wathiq was viewed as more versed in the knowledge of the Arabs ((ilm al-'arab).10 Whether indeed al-Ma'mun saw in al-Wathiq a worthy intellectual figure or even a future caliphal successor cannot be proven. Nevertheless it is significant that al-Wathiq was betrothed to al-Ma'mun's daughter Asma\ And although the marriage produced no offspring, it did put al-Wathiq on equal footing with Muhammad b. 'All b. Musa al-Rida, 'Abdallah b. Mansur b. al Mahdl (Mansur b. al-Mahdl was caliph in Baghdad in all but name during the chaos of A.H. 201), the future al-Mutawakkil, and Muhammad b. al-Mu'tasim (the father of the future al-Musta'in) ? all of whom were married to daughters of al-Ma'mun,11 and individuals who either became caliphs or stood inches away from the caliphal office. Also in great similarity to al-Ma'mun, al-Wathiq adopted a very pro-'Alid stance that did not escape mention by later Sunn! writers.12 This linking of al-Ma'mun and al-Wathiq ?and the degree of al-Wathiq's belief in the program of the Mu'tazila? takes on a special significance when we realize that a counter tradition of representation (mainly the post-Mihna, Jama'I-SunnI current) later tried to distance the caliph al-Wathiq from the Mihna program. This counter tradition would state that later in his reign, al Wathiq underwent a conversion to traditionalist beliefs, but that he died too soon to order the lifting of the Mihna. On the whole, this alleged change of heart by the caliph lacks a sound historical, political or social context, and gets further weakened when the sources try to pin it on a purported incident at court. The earliest version of this story is provided by Mas'udT (and is later repeated by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi and Ibn al-JawzI. It describes a scene in which a hadith scholar or ascetic said to be "min ahl al-fiqh wa'l-hadith min ahl adana min al-thaghr al-shami" was brought to face the caliph for questioning on the issue of the Mihna. While in other instances al-Wathiq carried out the questioning in person13 (as did al-Ma'mun before him), on this occasion we see 10 Al-Suli, Kitdb al-Awraq, critical text and translation into Russian by V.I. Beliaev and A.B. Khalidov, St. Petersburg, 1998, p. 572. I thank Matthew Gordon for drawing my attention to this text. Also, Abu 'l-Faraj al-Isfahani, al-Aghdrii, v. 9. pp. 315-335. 11 al-Baghdadi, Abu Ja'far Muhammad b. Habib, Kitdb al-Muhabbar, ed. I. Lichtenstedter, Beirut, 1967, pp. 61-62. 12 Qalqashandi would later characterize al-Wathiq as excessively pro-'Alid ("wa kdna yubdligh fi ikrdm al-alawiyyin?). Qalqashandi, Abu VAbbas Ahmad b. 'AH, Madthir al-Indfa fi Ma'dlim al-Khildfa, ed. A. A. Farraj, Kuwait, 1964), v. 1, p. 226; Ibn al-Sa'i, Mukhtasar Akhbdr al-Khulafd\ p. 60. 13 Aside from the case of Ahmad b. Nasr al-Khuza'i, see the brief story of al-Wathiq's questioning of al-Harith b. Miskin on the Mihna. Ibn 'Abd Rabbih, al-Iqd al-Farid, 44</page><page sequence="5">him delegating this responsibility to Ahmad b. Abl Du'ad (d. A.H. 240/A.D. 854). The story begins with a description of this "shaykh" being brought into the assembly in chains. After greeting the caliph, the ascetic opened a debate with Ibn Abl Du'ad that is confidently hostile. Reportedly neutral and shy throughout this encounter, al-Wathiq began by asking the ascetic: "O shaykh, answer the questions addressed to you by Abl 'Abdallah Ahmad b. Abl Du'ad." Before Ibn Abl Du'ad could say anything, the ascetic told the caliph, "Ahmad [b. Abl Du'ad] is incapable of debate ... allow me to question him before you." He then turns to the judge and asked: "What have you called on the people to accept?" "The view that the Qur'an is created," Ibn AM Du'ad said. "Is this assertion (maqala) something that you consider part of the faith so that an individual's belief would be incomplete?" "Yes." "Did the Messenger of God call on the people to embrace this view, or didn't he?" "He did not," the judge answered. "Did the Messenger of God know this position [the createdness creed], or didn't he?" "Indeed, he did," Ibn AM Du'ad said. "How could you then ask the people to accept a view which the Messenger of God has spared them?" Ahmad b. Abl Du'ad, the account says, here became at a loss for words, but the ascetic graciously agreed to continue the debate and started anew, asking the judge, "O Ahmad, God the Almighty says in His Glorious Book, "Today I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed my blessing upon you, and I have approved Islam for your religion" ("al-yawma akmaltu lakum dinakum ..." [Qur'an, 5:3]), but you say that one's faith would remain incomplete unless one accepts your statement on the createdness creed. Are you saying that you, with your deficiencies, are more correct than God, Who applies perfection and completeness in all matters?" Again, Ibn AM Du'ad was reportedly humbled, and yet the ascetic resumed with a third line of questioning. "O Ahmad, now consider God's statement in His Book, 'O Messenger, preach that which God has imparted unto you' [Qur'an, 5:67]. Do you consider the statement which you call on the people to embrace to be a part of what the Messenger of God preached or not?" Again, Ibn AM Du'ad fell silent. The ascetic turned to the caliph and said, "Thence the third example." After a moment had elapsed, the ascetic again asked the judge, "Tell me, O Ahmad. Assuming the Messenger of God believed in the statement you present to the people, do you find he held it to himself or suggested it to the public?" "Verily, he found it reasonable to hold it to himself," the judge said. "And, the situation remained the same with Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthman, 'All, may God be pleased with them?" the scholar asked. "Yes," Ibn AM Du'ad answered. Concluding his debate, the ascetic then turned to the caliph and said, "May God constrain our purposes if we reject the Cairo, 1967, v. 2, p. 465. Al-Harith is mentioned as having devised a punning technique of answering that saved him from the caliph's wrath. Ibn Nasr, however, Ibn 'Abd Rabbihi says, failed to answer using kindya and thus fell victim to it. 45</page><page sequence="6">latitude allowed us by the Messenger of God and his companions." Al-Wathiq replied, "Verily, we are putting ourselves in constraint, if we do not abide by what the Prophet and his companions did." The caliph is then portrayed as having shown great pity to the prisoner, weeping over the error of the Mihna, and declaring his apology to the ascetic. He then orders the guards to set the ascetic free, and commands that he be rewarded with a gift. The ascetic, however, rejects it and declares his desire to go back to the thaghr from which he came, then departs.14 The fictional nature of this anecdote should be clear from the way it relies on SunnI ideas and argumentative methods postdating the Mihna in order to represent the past. The artful postioning of Qur'anic verses to preface viewpoints about the silence of evidence, combined with the emphasis on the priority of keeping political harmony within the jamd'a clearly show the confidence and official backing in later times. The prime objective from the anecdote, however, was that it shifted the blame from al-Wathiq to Ahmad b. AM Du'ad for promoting the Mihna. In the end, Ibn AM Du'ad is shown as not only postulating a seditious doctrine, but also?by recalling this warrior shaykh from the thaghr?as distracting the community from the more important task of jihad. The fact that the traditionalist ascetic in the anecdote is attributed to "al thaghr al-shami" underscores the Syrian-leaning origin of Sunn! composition for this tradition, which became a rising current from the later ninth century onwards. This current grew partly as a result of the encouragement of al Mutawakkil and 'Abbasid officials such as the family of Ibn AM al-Shawarib, who served as chief judges and were descended from the Umayyads.15 By the time of al-Mutawakkil, Syria, and indirectly the Umayyads, were being 14 Mas'udi, Muriij al-Dhahab wa Ma'ddin al-Jawhar, ed. Ch. Pellat, Beirut, 1973, v. 5, pp. 100-101. For the authority of this report al-Mas'udi cites Salih b. 'AH al-Hashimi, who reportedly was told of the incident by the caliph al-Muhtadi. The same account and chain of narration is also given by Ibn Hamdun, al-Tadhkira, v. 9, pp. 251-55. Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Ta'rikh Baghdad, Cairo, 1931, v. 4, pp. 151-52, narrated to al-Baghdadi by Muhammad b. al-Faraj b. 'AH al-Bazzaz &lt;? 'Abdallah b. Ibrahim b. Mas! &lt;? Ja'far b. Shu'ayb al-Shashi &lt;? Ibrahim b. Munabbih &lt;? Tahir b. Khalaf &lt;? Muhammad b. al Wathiq (al-Muhtadi). Also, al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Ta'rikh Baghdad, 10:75-78. Ibn al Jawzi, al-Muntazam, ed. M. A. 'Ata, Beirut, 1992, v. 11, pp. 361-65. Ibn al-Jawzi's final authority for this story is also the caliph al-Muhtadi (d. A.H. 256/A.D. 870). Al-Subki includes a shortened version of this story. Al-Subki, Tabaqdt al-Shdfi'iyya al-Kubrd, ed. A. al-Hilw, Cairo 1964, v. 2, p. 55. In all these accounts the shaykh's name is not mentioned. W. Patton accepts the historical veracity of this anecdote as "fundamentally true," Ahmed b. Hanbal and the Mihna, p. 121. His sources in citing it are: Abu'l Mahasin, al-Maqrizi, al-Subki, and al-Suyutis Ta'rikh al-Khulafd\ Equally credulous is M. Hinds, Mihna, Encyclopaedia of Islam, 7 (1990), p. 4. 15 Also see James A.

We will examine below more closely how the above anecdote emerged as a response to the negative image of the caliph. Here it suffices for us to say that we can tell that this story is fictitious, not only because it is not recounted in the earlier sources, such as Tabarl, Baladhurl, and Ya'qubl, but also because it is even contradicted by these sources. While Mas'udI and al-Khatlb describe a caliph assuming a passive role in the Mihna,16 Tabarl and Ya'qubl describe a caliph who took an active part in implementing that religious program and who showed greater militancy in this effort than his predecessors. Ya'qubl, for example, tells us that it was in al-Wathiq's time that the caliphate carried the Mihna trial down to the average person such that during a prisoner exchange with the Byzantines in A.H. 231/A.D. 846, the 'Abbasid authorities were ordered to question prisoners about the createdness creed prior to their release by the Byzantines. Those who accepted the official Mu'tazill dogma on the createdness creed were ransomed and allowed into the Islamic lands, while those who refused?if there were any?were to be left behind.17 That al-Wathiq's times were no more lenient on the Mihna than before is confirmed by al-Kindl's mention that immediately after his accession, al-Wathiq wrote to his chief judge in Egypt, Ibn AblT-Layth, instructing him to step up enforcing the Mihna.18 Another way that later jamd'l historiography used to redeem the image of al-Wathiq lay in a more pointed blame of the caliph's chief judge, Ahmad b. Abl Du'ad, who was originally appointed by al-Ma'mun and then served al Mu'tasim before al-Wathiq. The above anecdote already highlighted how blaming Ibn Abl Du'ad for the Mihna went hand in hand with the traditionalist argument that discredited speculative theology by referring to the lack of 16 It is important to note that Mas'udi does not show consistency in this representation of al-Wathiq. In al-Tanblh wa'l-Ishrdf (p. 361) Mas'udi contradicts this image of a passive caliph when he says of al-Wathiq: "He busied himself with enforcing the Mihna, thereby leading people to turn against him, and dislike him" ("wa shaghala nafsahu bi mihnat al-nds fi'l-din fa-afsada qulubahum wa awjadahum al-sabll da l-tdni 'alayhi"). 17 Ya'qubi, Tdrlkh, Beirut, 1960, v. 2, p. 482. Tabari and Ibn al-Jawzi add that the Mihna of the prisoners also included the question of the beatific vision (Tabari, Tdrlkh, III, p. 1353; Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Muntazam, v. 11, p. 164). 18 M. Hinds, Mihna, Encyclopaedia of Islam, 7 (1990), p. 4; Al-Kindi, Kitab al-Wuldt wa Kitab al-Quddt (The Governors and Judges of Egypt), ed. R. Guest, Beirut, 1908, p. 451. Kindi's words are very telling. He states that while in al-Mu'tasim's time the matter of the Mihna was easy (kdna sahlan), al-Wathiq ordered in A.H.227/A.D.841 that people be questioned on this matter. When the caliph s decree came to his judge, Muhammad b. Abi 'l-Layth, Kind! says, "it was as if a fire was started." No jurist, hadlth scholar, muadhdhin, or even a school teacher was spared questioning, which had the effect of making people flee and caused prisons to fill up to capacity. It was at this time also that the inscription, "There is no god but God, the Lord of the created Quran," was added over the entry ways of mosques, and students of Malik b. Anas and al-Shafi'i were barred from entering the mosque of al-Fustat or loitering in its vicinity. 47</page><page sequence="8">hadith evidence on this issue. This exaggeration of Ibn Abl Du'ad's detrimental role in the Mihna, however, appears elsewhere as a campaign of direct attack on the caliph's chief judge.19 In Khatlb al-Baghdadl's work, for example, we read that it was Ibn Abl Du'ad who encouraged the caliph to insist on enforcing the Mihna (wa kdna Ibn Abi Du'ad qad istawla 'aid l-Wathiq wa hamalahu 'aid l tashaddud fTl-mihna).20 And Ahmad b. Hanbal goes farther, characterizing Ibn Abl Du'ad as an infidel by describing him thusly: "kafirun bi'llah al-'azim"21 As I indicated elsewhere, however, such writings mainly reflected orthodox efforts after the Mihna was lifted to distance the caliphs from blame for having enforced it.22 The singling out of Ibn Abl Du'ad, not just as the prime instigator of the Mihna but also as the inquisitor who misled the caliphs, is a current that can be discredited by one other key type of evidence, namely a widespread positive representation of Ibn Abl Du'ad's moral and political profile. Numerous anecdotes consistently show the judge as being very prone to compromise, temperance and generosity 23 As a statesman, he is frequently shown trying to soften the animosity of the caliphs toward opponents, aiming to resolve disputes and avert bloodshed.24 Even Mu'tasim is quoted as confirming this flattering image, telling his companions what a magnificent talent Ibn Abl Du'ad has for defusing tense situations. Examples of Ibn Abl Du'ad's benevolent behavior get particularly amplified and stylized in later medieval belles-lettres and biographical works, such as those by Tanukhl and Ibn Khallikan. This trend of flattering portraits of Ibn Abi Du'ad, aside from its self-contained, anecdotal moral value, stems from the earlier history of Tabarl. The image of Ibn Abl Du'ad as playing a detrimental role is nowhere better refuted than in an account of al-Wathiq putting a traditionalist scholar and descendant of the Abna', Ahmad b. Nasr b. Malik al-Khuza'I on trial. The narrative of this trial is one of very few accounts that describes al-Wathiq's 19 Ch. Pellat, Ahmad b. Abi Dudd, Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition, v. 1 (1960), p. 271; W. M. Patton, Ahmed b. Hanbal and the Mihna, pp. 55-56. 20 Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Tdrlkh Baghdad, v. 14, p. 18. This account is also narrated on the authority of al-Muhtadi. For other hostile accounts toward Ibn Abi Du ad, see Ibn Hamdun, al-Tadhkira, v. 5, p. 216. The same phrasing in Ibn al-Jawzi follows al-Baghdadi in this description (al-Muntazam, v. 11, p. 273). However, Ibn al-Jawzi says that were it not for the Mihna, Ibn Abi Du ad would have been praised in an unqualified way. 21 Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Tdrlkh Baghdad, v. 4, p. 153. 22 T.

Nasr was originally arrested and brought before the caliph. For some time before, Tabarl states, Ahmad b. Nasr, had been known in Baghdad for his hostility toward the caliph and the Mihna. While most victims of the Mihna were religious traditionalists from social circles with neither a political background of their own nor a tie to the 'Abbasid political order, Ahmad b. Nasr quickly became a prominent exception. As a descendant of a family that played a vital role in establishing 'Abbasid rule, Ahmad b. Nasr was in the spotlight as a credible opposition figure from within the state. Traditionalist scholars, such as Yahya b. Ma'In and Ahmad b. Khaythama, saw him as a potential supporter in their fight against the Mu'tazila. This raised the level of anger in the 'Abbasid court against Ahmad. And matters grew decidedly worse when a local plot to challenge the caliph was foiled in Samarra', and the conspirators, veterans of earlier movements of al-amr bVl-mcCruf wa'l-nahy 'an al-munkar in Baghdad, named Ahmad b. Nasr as one of their accomplices.25 With these political charges, the 'Abbasid authorities had to question Ahmad b. Nasr. It is especially noteworthy that the caliph did the questioning and that the issues on which he was questioned turned out to be religious, not political. When Ibn Nasr was brought before the caliph, the latter was heading an assembly of officials that included Ahmad b. Abi Du'ad, 'Abd al-Rahman b. Ishaq (a recently deposed judge in Samarra'), and Abu 'Abdallah al-Armanl, who is described as a friend of Ibn Abl Du'ad. The caliph began by asking: "O Ahmad, what do you have to say concerning the Qur'an?" Ibn Nasr answered: "It is the word of God," here giving the classic, noncooperative answer of hadith scholars from before. Unlike those who tended to dodge the question in an elliptical, punning style,26 Ahmad b. Nasr came ready to die for his views. He was, as Tabarl says, "mustaqtil, qad tanawwar wa tatayyab."21 Then al-Wathiq followed up with the question: "Is it created?" 83; Tanukhi, al-Faraj bdd al-Shidda, Beirut, 1978, pp. 66-75. 25 Tabari, Tdrikh, III, 1344. Account of failed rebellion and trial in W. M. Patton, Ahmed b. Hanbal and the Mihna, pp. 117-19. 26 The famous tale of a hadith scholar numbering al-tawrdt, al-injlly al-zabur, and al qur'dn on his fingers, and then pointing to the Qur'an and saying, "and I declare that this is created," but meaning that he is referring to his finger rather than the Qur'an, is a well known narrative of wit crafted as an edifying example of Sunn! avoidance of clash with the caliphate (i.e., advocating political quietism) while continuing to adhere to the uncreatedness belief. This is a story attributed to al-Harith b. Miskin. See, Ibn 'Abd Rabbih, al-lqd al-Farid, v. 2, p. 465; al-Safadi, al-Wdfi bi'l-Wafaydt, Wiesbaden, 1972, v. 6, pp. 367-68. (cited by F. Jad'an, al-Mihna, p. 157). In other versions the story is applied to al-Shafi'L 27 Tabari, Ta'rikh, III, 1347. J. Kraemer translates "tanawwar" as "smeared himself with a depilatory." J. Kraemer, The History of al-Tabarl, Incipient Decline, Albany: State University of New York, 1989, v. 34, p. 31. 49</page><page sequence="10">"It is the word of God," Ibn Nasr repeated. "Tell me your view concerning your Lord. Do you see him on the Day of Resurrection?" al-Wathiq asked. Ibn Nasr replied: "O Commander of the Faithful, traditional sayings (jd'at al-dthdr 'an rasul allah) handed down to us tell us that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: 'You shall see your Lord on Judgment Day like you see the moon, and you will not be harmed by the vision.'28 We follow this tradition (nahnu 'aid al-khabar). Sufyan b. 'Uyayna also narrated to me a hadith on sound authority (yarfa'uhu) that says: 'the heart of a human being is between two of God's fingers. He turns it.' The Prophet, peace be upon him also used to pray, 'O the One who turns the hearts, confirm my heart on your faith.'"29 The range of Ibn Nasr's hadiths underline his aversion to compromise, and show that his fight with the caliph was clearly a religious one. The scholar's lack of tact in debating the caliph cast a heavy shadow over the assembly. Those present became fearful, and Ishaq b. Ibrahim [al-Mus'abl], the Tahirid official who was once the first to communicate al-Ma'mun's Mihna order to the 'ulama', tried to moderate Ibn Nasr's passionate answers, saying: "Woe to you, man, watch what you are saying."30 But Ibn Nasr refused to succumb, saying that he was only giving the caliph the soundest advice. Al-Wathiq then reportedly looked around him in the assembly and asked: "What do you say about him?" Those who sought to ingratiate themselves with the caliph called for the most drastic punishments. 'Abd al-Rahman b. Ishaq said it would be permissible to punish Ibn Nasr with death, as did Abl 'Abdallah al-Armanl who said: "I want to drink his blood, O Commander of the Faithful." Ibn Abl Du'ad differed, however, saying: "O Commander of the Faithful, an apostate can still be asked to repent. He may have briefly gone mad or be suffering from something." Ibn Abl Du'ad was the only man who stood against immediate punishment. Tabarl adds that "it seems as though he [Ibn Abl Du'ad] were afraid that Ibn Nasr would be killed because of him." Al-Wathiq then pronounced his judgement. Boiling with anger, he called for a particularly notorious sword called al-Samsama, which Tabarl digresses 28 For another controversial incident involving this hadith, see the biography of 'AH b. al MadinL Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Ta'rikh Baghdad, v. 11, p. 466; al-Dhahabi, Siyar A'lam al-Nubald\ ed. Sh. al-Arna'ut et al, Beirut, 1994, v. 11, pp. 52-53. For references to the provenance of this hadith, see J. Kraemer, Incipient Decline, v. 34, p. 31 (n. 106). 29 Tabari, Ta'rikh, III, 1347. Partly drawing on J. Kraemer, Incipient Decline, v. 34, pp. 29 30. 30 Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi's version here replaces the statement of Ishaq b. Ibrahim with a line for al-Wathiq, who expresses rejection for Ibn Nasr's doctrine, saying: "Woe to you! He (i.e., God) is seen like a limited, embodied object, limited by location and encompassed by the vision of the human. I repudiate a deity whose characteristics are these (and akfuru bi-rabbin hddhihi sifatuhu)" Then al-Wathiq turned to those in the assembly and addressed them, saying: "What do you all say about him (i.e., Ibn Nasr)?" 50</page><page sequence="11">for some length to describe.31 Al-Wathiq then said: "When you see me rise, don't any of you rise to accompany me, for I am seeking sole religious reward in my steps towards him (fa-innl ahtasibu khutdya ilayhi)." Tabari then graphically describes the execution. Ibn Nasr was placed in the middle of an execution mat (nati'X and the caliph struck him with the sword. The first blow fell short of fatal. The second hit Ibn Nasr on the head, but it was Slma al dimashqi who finally came forth and finished off the victim. Ibn Nasr's body was then taken to the area where Babak al-Khurramf s body was. His body was crucifed there while the head was sent to the two main quarters of the city with a proclamation charging him with believing in divine anthropomorphism (tashbih) and engaging in infidel speech.32 Second to the trial of Ahmad b. Hanbal, Ibn Nasr's trial is the most important in the history of this period. In fact, Tabari, while omitting a description of Ibn Hanbal's trial, includes the story of Ibn Nasr. The reason Tabari includes this trial rather than the other may have to do partly with the seemingly more realistic historical character of Ibn Nasr's trial. However, there may be other reasons as well, which we will examine below, concerning how Tabari may have seen the murder of Ibn Nasr as setting the stage for the twilight of the Samarran caliphate. By looking at its depiction of characters, we can say that this story radically belies the view in other sources of the caliph as a passive figurehead in the Mihna. The story not only shows the caliph leading the process of questioning, but it also shows him as deeply impassioned and angry about religious views that support the position of hadith scholars.33 Ibn Abl Du'ad is shown as the only member of the assembly trying to save Ahmad Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Ta'rikh Baghdad, v. 5, pp. 176-177. 3* Mas'udi also provides a poetic story surrounding this sword, which belonged to 'Amr b. Ma'di Karib, a man who apostasized from Islam and fought with the Ridda folk, then reconverted to Islam, and gained fame for his exploits at Qadisiyya. Whether the shade of the Ridda associated with the background of the sword continued to be of signifying value by the time of this story's composition and was meant to have an effect on the image of al-Wathiq in this story is open to debate. Mas'udi, Muruj al-Dhahab, v. 4, p. 195. Tabari also mentions earlier in his chronicle that the caliph 'Abd al-Malik used the same sword to kill a pretender to the throne in Damascus, 'Amr b. Sa'id b. al-'As, in A.H. 69/A.D. 689 (Tabari, Ta'rikh, v. II, p. 791). 32 Tabari, Ta'rikh, vol. Ill, 1343-1349. Al-Khatlb al-Baghdadi recounts the story of Ibn Nasr's execution according to the following chain: al-Baghdadi &lt;? Abu 'Abdallah al Saymari &lt;? Muhammad b. Tmran al-Marzubani &lt;? Muhammad b. Yahya al-Suli (Ta'rikh Baghdad, v. 5, p. 176; Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Muntazam, v. 11, pp. 16-17; Miskawayh, Tajdrib al-Umam, pp. 529-32; Al-Subki, Tabaqdt al-Shdfi'iyya al-Kubrd, v. 2, p. 52). Al Subki adds that the head of Ahmad b. Nasr made the declaration, "There is no god but God," when it was struck off. While al-Tamimi does not mention this in the context of Ahmad b. Nasr's death, he includes it in his much lengthier account of Sa'id b. Jubayr who was killed by al-Hajjaj. Abu'l-'Arab al-Tamimi, Kitdb al-Mihan, ed. Y. al-Jabburi, Beirut, 1983, p. 219. 33 Al-Tamimi describes al-Wathiq as "arrogant" {wa kdna al-Wdthiq 'ajrafiyyan) Abu'l 51</page><page sequence="12">b. Nasr from a worsening situation34 and to give the caliph a peaceful way out of the confrontation. Tabarl's story regarding Ibn Nasr is also worth comparing with the story about the "shaykh" from the Syrian frontier provided by Mas'udl, al-Khatib, and Ibn al-JawzI. It seems possible that Ibn Nasr's story may have provided the stimulus for the literary form and thematic organization of the "shaykh" story. In its details, Mas'udfs story is a reversal of Tabarl's; in Mas'udl's story, al Wathiq not only leaves the task of questioning to Ibn Abl Du'ad, but also sides with the man opposing the Mu'tazill creed. The wider question-answer structure of Mas'udl's story is also directly borrowed from Tabarl's account, although in Mas'udl the hadith scholar becomes the one who controls the questioning. Knowing that the story of Ahmad b. Nasr's death was not meant in origin to defend al-Wathiq as a neutral patron of the Mihna allows us to position it within a different set of narratives that seem to represent certain facts more accurately rather than indulging in apologetics. One can be led to believe that Tabarl's account reflects a more historical reality in light of his careful naming of participants in al-Wathiq's assembly, all of whom were likely to have been present. Nevertheless, Tabarl's story is itself a fiction. Yet it is one that belongs to an earlier age, when narratives were crafted with a different set of thematic intentions. Having explored the polemical-apologetic layer of representation used by al-Mas'udl and al-Khatlb, we can now go further back in time to examine the earlier layer of representation on which Tabarl's narratives were crafted. The question that arises then is: What did Tabari hope to accomplish by including Ibn Nasr's story? As I have shown, the story of Ibn Nasr's trial supports an image of al Wathiq as a vehement figure who sent terror down the spine of those in his assembly. A mere thirty-five years old when this incident is said to have happened, the caliph is assigned an awe-inspiring degree of Solomonic charisma that kept all his staff humble. This was no small feat at that time, and it is especially appreciable to readers well acquainted with the contemporaneous military generals such as Itakh and Bugha al-kablr, who controlled the political world of Samarra' at the time and were important power brokers. The image of al-Wathiq's charismatic presence is further confirmed when Tabari later describes the caliph's death. In a narrative that Tabari alone relates among the early chronicles, Tabari describes how death suddenly came to al-Wathiq. We are told that the caliph was receiving treatment for a sudden attack of dropsy.35 He had asked to be placed in a heated vessel (tannur) to alleviate his 'Arab al-Tamimi, Kitdb al-Mihan, p. 253. 34 Some accounts describe a moment where Ibn Nasr insulted the caliph. Abu'l-'Arab al Tamimi, Kitdb al-Mihan, p. 253. Abu'l-'Arab &lt;- Musa b. 'Abd al-Rahman. Later Ibn al-Jawzi would give a background story about the reasons al-Wathiq fell mortally ill, citing his indulgent lifestyle, and would call the whole story a "khabar 52</page><page sequence="13">ailment. As this helped him on the first day, the caliph asked that the heat be increased the second day. When this was done, however, the caliph was overcome with exhaustion and asked to be removed and positioned on a litter (mihaffa). He remained for a period, receiving guests, including al-Fadl b. Ishaq al-Hashiml, 'Umar b. Faraj, Ibn Abl Du'ad, and Ibn al-Zayyat. At some point, however, while his staff was present and probably expediting state business, the caliph had a heart attack and died. Because his eyes stayed open and his posture was unchanged, no one suspected anything. Tabarl then provides a critical line that gives meaning to this whole portrait when he says: "They were unaware of the caliph's death until his face struck the litter, at which point they realized that he had died"36 ("fa-lam ya'lamu bi-mawtihi hatta daraba bi wajhihi l-mihaffa").31 This line, which seems innocently descriptive, bears a remarkable stylistic resemblance to the phrasing used to describe the death of Solomon, as recounted in the Qur'an in the verse, "And when we decreed that he [Solomon] should die, nothing indicated to them that he was dead except a little worm of the earth devouring his staff; and when he fell down, the jinn saw clearly that, had they had known the unseen, they would not have continued in the humbling chastisement." ("fa-lamma qadayna 'alayhi l-mawta ma dallahum 'aid mawtihi ilia ddbbatu l-ardi ta'kulu minsa'atah fa-lamma kharr tabayyanat l-jinnu an law kanu ya'lamiina l-ghayba ma labithu fVl-adhabi l muhiri").3* On a purely artistic level, the correspondences in imagery and phrasing between the death scenes of al-Wathiq and Solomon are unique in the sources, highlighting how classical imagery (in this case Qur'anic) was disassembled and applied sporadically across the lives of the caliphs. However, the narrator probably intended here his analogy to establish a wider scope of implication that encompassed the political and social situations of the two authoritarian figures. Just as Solomon is represented in the Qur'an as a mighty ruler who enslaved various forms of powerful creatures and kept them so much at bay that, when he died, they would not dare test whether he was still alive, so the caliph al-Wathiq is shown as a terrifying figure whose power kept those around him at a considerable distance. The analogy takes a negative cast when applied to al-Wathiq, however, given that the caliph adamantly enforced the Mihna and forced those around him to do the same. The power of Solomon becomes unrighteous tyranny in the case of al-Wathiq while the officials?military, tarif". Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Muntazam, v. 11, pp. 186-88. One cannot but admit, however, that the portrait of al-Wathiq as indulgent bears resemblance to that of the Umayyad caliph Sulayman b. 'Abd al-Malik. 36 J. Kramer, Incipient Decline, v. 34, pp. 51-52. 37 Tabari, Ta'rikh, III, 1363; Miskawayh, Tajdrib al-Umam, p. 535. 38 Qur'an, 34:14, trans., A.J. Arberry, The Koran Interpreted, v. 2, p. 132-33. (with slight modification). 53</page><page sequence="14">judicial, and bureaucratic?who followed the caliph's orders stylistically mirror the rowdy people whom Solomon succeeded in enslaving and putting to his service. In the end, al-Wathiq dies from a punishing heat that hints at the hostility of the orthodox narrators. We see here how Tabarl's version of al-Wathiq's death scene conveys a two-tiered representation. The first is purely artistic, establishing the connection with Solomon; the second is more distant, reversing the virtuous power of Solomon into al-Wathiq's negative political role, placing responsibility on him for keeping the Mihna, and placing his death in the context of an allusive punishment.39 Focusing still on the Qur'anic verse cited above, a reader may well wonder, however, if the act of literary borrowing shown above in Tabari was simply confined to theme and phrasing. Did narrators do anything, for example, with other elements in the representation of Solomon's death scene, such as the segment that describes the earthworm eating his staff? Although the art of historical representation did not always make use of all elements drawn from a classical frame of reference, especially in light of diverse contexts as we have in the situation of these two death scenes, one can find upon wider scrutiny that indeed that portion of representation (relating to the earthworm) did not entirely drop out of the picture through the process of literary transmission. A slight digression on Tabarl's omission, however, is first necessary. Tabarl's account of the death of al-Wathiq is quickly followed by a description of how Ibn Abi Du'ad then took charge of preparing the body for burial. Tabari states, "It is said: 'Ahmad b. Abl Du'ad showed up at his side when he [the caliph] had fainted. [Al-Wathiq] then died while [Ibn Abl Du'ad] was at his side. [Ibn Abl Du'ad] then set about closing [al-Wathiq's] eyes and placing his body in state (fa-aqbala yughammiduhu wa yuslihu min sha'nihi)'"40 The chronicler moves on to give information about al-Wathiq's death date and declares that the caliph was buried at his HarunI palace. He adds that Ibn Abl 39 There may even be a third connection that Tabari sought to establish on a stylistic level to a Qur'anic verse about Moses. It is possible that Tabari intended the scene of al Wathiq's assembly of officials at the trial to be seen in conjunction with the classical Quranic image of Pharaoh's assembly and the confrontation with Moses. Earlier in his chronicle of the events of A.H.I26/A.D.744, Tabari describes a parallel official questioning of state rebel, Jadi' b. 'AH al-Kirmani. When Nasr b. Sayyar questions those around him what to do with al-Kirmani, they immediately call for his death, which prompts one of those present to say with disdain: "Verily those in the company of Pharaoh were better than you when they told him: "Put him and his brother off for a while [and send among the cities musterers]" (Tabari, II, 1860), referring to the Qur anic verse (7:11) that described a slower pace for the judgment of Moses by Pharaoh. In light of the backdrop of this earlier account in Tabari and the Quranic image, it is not unlikely that Ibn Nasr's narrative was meant to be seen in a similar way, namely that al Wathiq's advisors were being worse than Pharaoh's company. Tabari, Tdrlkh, II, p. I860. 40 Ibidem, III, 1363. 54</page><page sequence="15">Du'ad led the funeral prayers over al-Wathiq and then provides the usual information about the caliph?his physical appearance, his age, and the duration of his rule. There is reason to believe, however, that Tabarl's description of how Ibn AM Du'ad set about preparing the caliph's body for burial was torn from a more detailed account provided in full elsewhere. That narrative describes not just how Ibn AM Du'ad took charge of preparing al-Wathiq's body for burial, but also how death came gradually to the caliph while he kept on striking fear in the hearts of his associates. This fuller story can be found in the work of al Khatlb al-Baghdadl, who narrates it on the authority of a former governor of Basra, who says, "I happened to be among those who looked after al-Wathiq during his fatal illness. One day, while I attended to him with the help of servants and the mawdliy he suddenly fainted. We felt almost certain that the man was dead, so one of us said, 'Come forward, let's check on him.' None but I dared approach. As I neared the side of his head and prepared to touch his face, he suddenly regained consciousness and opened his eyes, and I almost lost my wits out of fear that he would recognize that I stepped outside my assigned rank in his assembly. As I made to retreat, the handle of my sword must have got stuck somewhere and I stumbled, leaning so severely on the sword that it almost injured me, but I made it. I went out and changed my attire, replaced my robe, and returned to my designated position in the assembly. Soon, al-Wathiq expired in such a way that we were certain he was gone. I came forward, wrapped his beard together, closed his eyes, and pointed him towards the qibla. Various servants then came to store away the furnishings of that assembly, and he [al-Wathiq] was left alone in the chamber. Ibn AM Du'ad then turned to me and said, 'I must now attend to the matter of succession. Yet we should not leave him until he is buried. Since you were so close to him in his lifetime, I would like you to sit by him during the interim.' So I saw everyone out, came back to [al-Wathiq's] chamber, shut the door, and sat outside in the garden, guarding the room. Moments later, I heard an unusual noise inside that struck me with terror. As I quickly opened the door to see what was happening, I noticed that a rat, which must have made its way from the garden, was making off with al-Wathiq's eye. I stood transfixed at the sight and thought to myself, 'Verily, there is no god but God. How has it happened that the eye that he opened suddenly just a while ago, leaving me stumbling on my sword, has ended in the mouth of such a weak creature?' When the servants later came to fetch the caliph to perform the funerary washing, Ibn [AM] Du'ad asked me what had happened to the caliph's eye, and I told him the 55</page><page sequence="16">whole story."41 On its own, this anecdote communicates a cohesive, self-contained message on the ephemeral nature of power. In a humbling, sober, and almost comical way the story satirizes the image of al-Wathiq's imposing presence. This type of ironic, reflective assessment of turns of fortune is the kind of literature that would become most favored in the tenth century, especially in the moralizing tales of al-Tanukhl, Miskawayh, and Bayhaqi. One can presume that the story originated as a secular form of political irony, or one can more plausibly find its inspiration in the Qur'anic verse that highlights the weakness of man vis-a vis seemingly weaker creatures; as in the verse that reads: "Surely those upon whom you call, apart from God, shall never create a fly, though they banded together to do it; and if a fly should rob them of aught, they would never rescue it from him. Feeble indeed are both the seeker and the sought."42 Beyond its self-contained message on the vicissitudes of power, however, this anecdote can be read as being more broadly suggestive when related to other narratives of al-Wathiq's life. For example, if we read this anecdote in conjunction with both Tabarl's story of al-Wathiq's death, and the image of 41 Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Ta'rikh Baghdad, v. 14, pp. 19-20: Al-Baghdadi &lt;- al-Tanukhi &lt;? al-fanukhis father &lt;? al-Husayn b. al-Hasan b. Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Wathiqi &lt;? Ahmad b. Muhammad (citing his father as narrator). Also, al-Tanukhi, Nishwdr al Muhddara, v. 2, p. 73: al-Tanukhi &lt;? al-Husayn b. al-Hasan b. Ahmad b. Yahya al Wathiqi (a relative of al-Tanukhi's father) &lt;? al-Husayn's father &lt;? Abu Ahmad (governor of Basra). Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Muntazam, v. 11, pp. 185-86 (citing a similar chain to al-Tanukhi). Ibn al-Athir follows al-Khatib al-Baghdadi and al-Tanukhi's version, and includes the complete scene of al-Wathiq's death. Ibn al-Athir, al-Kdmil fl'l-Ta'rlkh, ed. C. J. Tornberg, repr. Beirut, 1965-1967, v. 7, p. 29. Elsewhere, variant versions of this anecdote state that it was the commander Itakh, who was struck with fear by al Wathiq's gaze. Al-Tha'alibi, Latd'if al-Ma'drif, ed. P. de Jong, E. J. Brill, 1867, p. 86; Al Suli, Kitdb al-Awrdq, p. 555; Ibn Hamdun, al-Tadhkira, v. 9, p. 209 (Ibn Hamdun makes the culprit a cat instead). Cats, however, did this sort of thing to the Umayyads. See the story of a cat running off with the tongue of Marwan b. Muhammad, the last Umayyad caliph, after he was killed. Al-Suli, Ash'dr Awldd al-Khulafd' min Kitdb al-Awrdq, ed. J. Hey worth Dunne, reprint in Beirut, 1982, p. 305: al-Suli &lt;? Husayn b. Fahm and Muhammad b. Musa &lt;? Muhammad b. Sa'id &lt;? Muhammad b. Salih al-Nattah Abu 'Abdallah. In the new Russian edition of al-Suli's al-Awrdq, the story of Marwan and the cat is told immediately after the story of al-Wathiq's loss of his eye (Kitdb al-Awrdq, p. 555). 42 Quran, 22:72 (A.J. Arberry, The Koran Interpreted, v. 2, pp. 35-36). This brings to mind the famous story in al-Jahiz's Kitdb al-Hayawdn about the wiles of flies. Al-Jahiz's story describes a certain 'Abdallah b. Sawwar, a judge in Basra, who was famous for his sparse physical movements during prayer and while dispensing justice in court. One day, however, he was so badly accosted by a fly that he was forced to wave it away, and then reflecting on the irony of his state, and recited the verse mentioned above. Al-Jahiz, Kitdb al-Hayawdn, ed. A.S. Harun, Cairo, 1969, v. 3, pp. 343-45. Ibn Sawwar died in A.H. 228/A.D. 842. His brief biography in al-Safadi's al-Wdfi bi'l-Wafaydt, ed. D. Krawulsky, (Biblioteca Islamica, pt. 6), Wiesbaden, 1982, v. 17, p. 205. 56</page><page sequence="17">Solomon's fall after his staff collapsed from the worm's gnawing, one can hypothesize that certain stylistic motifs passed from one literary frame to another. Eventually, this shows us how the Qur'anic scene of Solomon's death was fully reshaped in Tabari to convey a commentary on the historical circumstances of al-Wathiq's reign. While the posture of Solomon was directly appropriated to become that of al-Wathiq, and while the impact of the two on their followers corresponds accurately, the act of the worm gnawing away at Solomon's staff becomes the rat's grabbing of al-Wathiq's eye. The shifting of this act from the staff to the eye accomplished the artistic goal of making correspondence seem distant or even nonexistent to the reader. But Tabari probably saw al-Wathiq's story as sufficiently close to the Qur'anic model so that he chose to omit the entire story about the attendant's experience with al Wathiq before and after death. As a result, readers of Tabari can only glean the linkage to the Qur'anic image of Solomon's death from the inflection in the sentence describing al-Wathiq's death: "fa-lam ya'lamu bi-mawtihi hand daraba bi-wajhihi l-mihaffar This resembles the Qur'anic verse that describes the turn in the audience's knowledge of Solomon's case. One mild indication that Tabari had originally included al-Baghdadl's story in his narrative following the story of al-Wathiq's death from dropsy can be found in the fact that Tabari quickly follows up his description of how Ibn Abl Du'ad prepared al-Wathiq's body in a garden for burial by the statement that the caliph was buried in his palace al Harunl, a statment that would have concluded the dual narrative of al-Wathiq's death. The story about al-Wathiq terrifying his attendant was probably the primary image that later impelled the western orientalist imagination to speak of the "terrible gaze" of al-Wathiq. The image, then, was not entirely formed out of thin air. The caliph's wild-eyed anger at Ahmad b. Nasr al-Khuza'I, as we saw above, his awe-inspiring presence as he was receiving treatment just before he expired, and this last account all come together to confirm that the caliph's gaze was unusual. Among the caliphs, he alone seems to have had that amazing stare, and thereof we find a disproportionate emphasis on his eye. But is the possibility that his stare was unusual adequate to explain this emphasis? The answer, I would argue, is directly tied to a key issue of the Mihna, namely that of the beatific vision (whether believers can see God on Judgment Day, as the hadith states). This issue, as we saw above, was vehemently contested during the trial of Ahmad b. Nasr al-Khuza'I and provided the backdrop that impelled 57</page><page sequence="18">the caliph to execute Ibn Nasr 43 While in the days of al-Ma'mun the issue was the createdness creed, in al-Wathiq's time the caliph seems to have turned to making the issue of the beatific vision (more specifically "tashbih", or anthropomorphism) the cornerstone of the Mihna. As narrators set out to craft their allusive representation of al-Wathiq and sought to couch their imagery with commentary, they purposely emphasized the awe inspiring gaze of al Wathiq to bring it into dialogue with the issue of the beatific vision. Thus what the caliph was denying would happen in physical terms after death, would affect him in the loss of his eye after death. While this explanation will undoubtedly remain hypothetical, given the numerous hints of the narrators and the carefully ordered connections they establish between historical issues and representational situations, it seems likely that an ideological as well as an artful intention lay behind their particular images of al-Wathiq. The point is that this was a caliph who had trouble seeing what he was denying. Even al-Ma'mun is made to comment on this. In an anecdote describing one of al-Ma'mun's several visits to Damascus toward the end of his reign, Ibn al Athlr tells us that the caliph stopped at the family of a certain Sa'Id b. Ziyad and asked him about a document the Prophet had given them. When Ibn Ziyad brought out the document and showed it to the caliph, the latter noticed a covering (ghishd') on the seal and became curious about the purpose of the elaborate seal. When his associates (particularly al-Mu'tasim) suggested that he unravel the seal to see what it hid, the caliph rejected the suggestion, saying, "This no doubt is a bind that the Messenger of God tied, and I would never unravel a knot that the Messenger of God tied together." He then held the seal, put it on his tearful eyes, turned to al-Wathiq, and said, "Here, take it and put it on your eyes; perhaps God will cure you!"44 Conclusion In the years that followed the lifting of the Mihna, a particular and vigorous historical current tried to distance the 'Abbasid caliphs from responsibility for the Mihna, placing the blame instead on officials and judges such as Ahmad b. AM Du'ad. The caliph al-Wathiq received his share of 43 Theories suggesting that the caliph feared Ibn Nasr's political threat, since just before the trial the latter was involved in a murky attempt to challenge the caliph, vastly exaggerate the political significance of the stylized tale about Ibn Nasr's "conspiracy." Just as in earlier misreadings of the narratives of the civil war that read in the uprising of the Baghdad commune some confluence of a puritanical religious current, embodied in the movement of Khalid al-Daryush and others, with an anti-Iranian/anti-Ma'mun sentiment, the emphasis placed on Ibn Nasr's connection to the Abna and potential anti caliphal movement in Baghdad is unwarranted. 44 Ibn al-Athir, al-Kdmil, v. 6, p. 433; Ibn Tayfur, Kitab Baghdad, Baghdad, 1968, p. 148. Ibn Tayfur cites this report on the authority of 'All b. al-Hasan b. Harun, who was told of the incident by Sa'id b. Ziyad. 58</page><page sequence="19">treatments in this apologetic literature, which portrayed him as desiring to back the position of traditionalist hadith scholars on issues such as the createdness of the Qur'an and the beatific vision. Yet when Tabarl's narratives are examined closely and in conjunction with other narratives, we can discern an earlier historical voice that strongly criticized al-Wathiq for enforcing the Mihna. By examining a range of literary and allusive techniques, this essay has argued that these earlier narrators focused their critiques on the issue of the beatific vision. The origins of the various stories describing the eye of al-Wathiq and his strong gaze had little to do with a physical description. Rather, these narratives are more likely to have used the motif of vision to allude to the controversy over the beatific vision and engage the artful theme of reversal of fortune. A key event that may have especially motivated this exercise of representation was the caliph's trial and execution of Ahmad b. Nasr b. Malik al-Khuza'I, a descendant of the Abna' and a famous proponent of the traditionalist doctrine against the Mu'tazila. Aside from his brief involvement in political opposition to al-Wathiq, Ahmad b. Nasr was mainly victimized by the 'Abbasids to make an example to hadith and traditionalist scholars. In later times, however, memory of this event turned Ibn Nasr into a martyr and gave rise to a rich hagiographic tradition that attributed miracles to his dead body. One report takes the form of a dream that shows Ibn Nasr wearing a crown in heaven and reporting that the Prophet Muhammad told him that he was embarrassed that a member of his family killed him.45 Another more critical account states that the head of Ahmad b. Nasr which was exhibited in Baghdad, used to recite the Qur'an, and that this claim was also made about the head of John the Baptist.46 This comparison with John the Baptist opens up new roads for historical inquiry, relating to the theme of the redemptive death, since the murder of John the Baptist was viewed by Tabarl not only as a moment of tragic martyrdom, but as one that prompted a new historical cycle that ended with the destruction of the ancient Israelite state by an eastern conqueror.47 Islamic historiography inherited from early on this paradigm of a cataclysmic death 45 Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Ta'rikh Baghdad, v. 5, p. 179: Al-Baghdadi &lt;?

Nasr was accidentally uncovered centuries later, it was found still unchanged.

There, these events formed the backdrop for contextualizing the later phases of civil war as divine punishment that befell the Islamic community afterward.48 In view of Tabarfs cyclical and repeating frames for redemptive history, it is likely that the analogy between the hagiographic imagery about Ahmad b. Nasr al-Khuza'I and John the Baptist was meant to evoke the martyrdom of the holy man as a later parallel to the prophetic death. To what extent Tabarl intended to establish a similar linkage for the Samarra' period between the vivid tragedy of Ahmad b. Nasr and the phases of civil strife that beset the 'Abbasid capital in the later ninth century remains an open question. UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS (AMHERST) SUMMARY The 'Abbasid caliph al-Wathiq (838-842) is one of the least studied of the caliphs of the Samarran period, although he is generally considered the last to rule an effective, centralized caliphate. Information about him in the medieval sources is split between literary anecdotes in belles-lettres works and historical reports preserved mainly by Tabari and other chroniclers. This study explores the relation between these two types of sources and the way narrators constructed a fictional image of this caliph that was allusive in form and conditioned by his religious policies during the Mihna. 48 Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, Ta'rikh Baghdad, v. 1, p. 142.
