Development of the Stretch Reflex in the Newborn: Reciprocal Excitation and Reflex Irradiation. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1993, 64, 1036- 1045. The stretch reflex is a spinal cord pathway between a muscle's stretch receptors and its own motor units. This reflex is thought to play an important role in normal motor function, because it is unique as a monosynaptic pathway, and because its hyperactivity is a hallmark of many motor disorders. We previously reported a difference in the stretch reflexes in healthy newborn infants and nonambulatory individuals with cerebral palsy (CP): these reflexes are characterized by responses from the stretched muscle and from the reciprocal or antagonist muscle. We proposed the existence of a functional spinal cord pathway that connects both agonist and antagonist muscles at a single joint. We hypothesized that this "reciprocal excitation" is a functional pathway of all newborn infants, which during the normal course of development of motor skills in infants is eliminated. If the CNS is damaged at birth, as in CP, the pathway of reciprocal excitation endures and is reinforced. In the current study of newborns, we recorded stretch reflex responses from all major muscle groups of the lower limb. This "irradiation of reflexes" is a normal phenomenon of the newborn CNS. This pathway becomes suppressed during normal maturation and control of coordinated limb movements. Classic assessments of infant neuromo- tor functioning have focused on the integrity of the so-called infantile or primitive re- flexes. This diverse group of movements, which include the Moro, stepping, placing, rooting, and palmar and plantar grasp re- flexes, observed in newborn infants, wane over the first months of life, and eventually disappear. There is considerable contro- versy over whether the early patterns are in- hibited by higher brain maturation or are in- corporated into later movements, or indeed whether some of them can be considered "reflexes" at all (Barnes, Crutchfield, Her- iza, &amp; Heardman, 1990). The continuity and importance of one newborn infant reflex, the stretch reflex, is incontrovertible, however. Muscle stretch reflexes are responses to rapid stretch. Con- sider the familiar case of the tap below the knee cap with the reflex hammer and the subsequent reflex extension of the lower leg. The tap on the tendon briefly but rapidly stretches the quadriceps muscle group to which it is attached. Receptors in the muscle detect the stretch and signal the spinal cord by way of afferent fibers which synapse di- rectly with motor units, a monosynaptic con- nection. The muscle begins to contract soon (35-40 ms) after the stretch is delivered, leading to the "jerk" of the leg. Normally the afferent fibers also connect through an interneuron to the motoneurons of the antag- onist muscle group, the hamstrings, but this connection is inhibitory. This causes the ex- tensor muscle to contract, while the flexor muscle relaxes. This pattern of the mutual excitation of the agonist and inhibition of the antagonist is called reciprocal inhibition (Fig. 1, left side). Stretch reflexes are presumed to be an essential part to normal coordinated and controlled movement, because they provide rapid detection and modulation of active This work has been supported in part by funding from VA Rehabilitation R&amp;D, the Founda- tion for Physical Therapy, and NIH grant AR33189.

FIG. 1.-Schematic representation of spinal cord circuitry, illustrating the normal stretch reflex pathway of reciprocal inhibition (left) (Paths 1 and 2), and hypothetical functional pathways of reflex irradiation (right) (Paths 3 and 4) in the newborn infant. The normal adult response to stretch results from the firing of Ia afferent fibers which are excitatory on the agonist motor fiber (Path 1) and simulta- neously inhibitory on the antagonist muscle through an interneuron (Path 2). We propose that in the newborn, stretch of a muscle is simultaneously facilitory on the stretched muscle and its antagonist by monosynaptic or polysynaptic pathways (reciprocal excitation, Path 3), and also facilitory on neigh- boring limb muscles by way of segmental interneurons (Path 4). The role of modulation of reflexes by descending tonic inhibition cannot be discounted. muscle force as a function of the external forces acting to lengthen or shorten the mus- cles. People with disorders of movement of- ten have abnormal stretch reflexes. For ex- ample, in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP), the stretch reflexes are often hyperac- tive. In addition to this hyperactivity, these individuals may also have reciprocal excita- tion of antagonist muscles, when both the agonist and antagonist muscles are excited, rather than inhibition of the antagonist mus- cles seen in normal individuals (Gottlieb, Myklebust, Penn, &amp; Agarwal, 1982; Mykle- bust, Gottlieb, Penn, &amp; Agarwal, 1982). Thus, taps of the Achilles tendon evoke brief electromyographic (EMG) responses from both the stretched soleus muscle and the an- tagonist tibialis anterior muscle. These re- sponses occur in both muscles at similar monosynaptic latencies and comparable am- plitudes. To explain these data in individu- als with cerebral palsy, we proposed that the connections from muscle spindle afferent neurons simultaneously excite both agonist and antagonist motoneuron pools (see Fig. 1, right side, pathways 1 and 3). Cerebral palsy is the result of injury to higher brain centers at or near the time of birth. Why do these individuals have abnor- mal spinal reflexes? The conventional expla- nation is that both the abnormal reflex pro- file and the more significant deficits in voluntary motor activities are the direct re- sult of the cerebral injury. We believe that a developmental explanation is more likely (Leonard, Hirscheld, &amp; Forssberg, 1988; Myklebust, 1986, 1990; Myklebust, Gottlieb, &amp; Agarwal, 1986)-that is, that reciprocal in- hibition is an acquired pattern, and that the cerebral injury causes the child to retain an infantile reflex pattern. The basis for this conclusion is our dis- covery of reciprocal excitation, similar to that seen in CP patients, in lower limbs of normal newborn infants (Leonard et al., 1988; Myklebust, 1986, 1990; Myklebust et al., 1986). Like the CP individuals, new- borns respond to an Achilles tendon tap with excitation at both the soleus and anterior tib- ialis. This suggests that the pathways medi- ating the reflex are different for newborns than for adults; this raises the possibility that the reflex hyperactivity in CP is the result of damage to the spinal cord that develops subsequent to the cerebral injury. Equally important is the developmental progression from the diffuse newborn pattern of the re- flex to the more differentiated adult reflex. If, in newborns, excitation from a spe- cific stretch stimulus spreads to the antago- nist muscle, it is important to ask whether</page><page sequence="3">1038 Child Development this effect is localized only to the antagonist muscle, or is more widely distributed. Thus, in this study, we tested the spread of reflex EMG elicited by a tendon tap to other mus- cle groups of the lower limb (soleus, tibialis anterior, quadriceps, and hamstrings). We found diffuse responses that go beyond the agonist-antagonist pair. The results of our study have led us to expand our concept of immature reflexes from "reciprocal excitation" of muscle antag- onists at a single joint, to one of "reflex irra- diation." By this we denote a reflex with one or at most a few synapses at adjacent levels of the spinal cord which link muscles at more than one joint. Reflex irradiation is a normal characteristic of the newborn ner- vous system. Method Tendon jerk reflexes were tested in seven healthy male newborns from 1 to 3 days old (Table 1). For each, the full-term pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. Developmental examination confirmed neu- romuscular and physical maturity; gesta- tional age of 39-42 weeks was determined by physical examination. The size of each infant was appropriate or large for gesta- tional age, with birth weights from 2,807 to 4,111 grams. Apgar scores were 8 or 9 at 1 min, and 9 at 5 min for all infants. During testing, the infant lay supine, with the hips flexed and externally rotated; the knees were flexed, and the ankles were in a neutral position. The head was main- tained in the midline for sleeping infants; they turned their heads to the right when awake. The infants were observed in var- ious states of consciousness-awake or light sleep (Brazelton, 1973). Tendon taps were administered only when the infant was lying quietly and not kicking. No differences in reflexes were found with state of conscious- ness (O'Sullivan, Eyre, &amp; Miller, 1991), ex- cept that reflexes could not be obtained consistently during deep sleep (see Fig. 4). This is consistent with studies of the H- reflex (Hodes &amp; Grebitz, 1962). Due to large- amplitude background EMG activity during kicking, reflex EMG responses would not have been identifiable during these move- ments. Taps were applied no more often than every 15 sec to the Achilles and patellar ten- dons. The number of taps applied depended on the infant's cooperation. Testing lasted up to 30 min. Tendon jerks were elicited with a modi- fied reflex hammer instrumented to trigger the computerized data collection system (Myklebust, Gottlieb, &amp; Agarwal, 1984; My- klebust et al., 1986). Surface EMGs were recorded from soleus (SOL), tibialis anterior (TA), quadriceps (QUAD), and hamstrings (HAM) muscles. Boston elbow myoelec- trodes (MYO-111; Liberty Mutual Research Center, Hopkinton, MA) were secured to the limb with Velcro straps. These electrodes had a gain of 3000, and they filtered out sig- nals below 4 Hz and above 500 Hz. Elec- trodes were 0.5 cm in diameter. There was 1.5 cm between the centers of the elec- trodes. The signals were digitized by computer at a rate of 1,000 samples/sec. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of the biphasic re- sponse was measured by computer. Measurements of peak EMG ampli- tudes and of latencies were made in all four TABLE 1 CHARACTERISTICS OF NEWBORN INFANTS TESTED BY STRETCH REFLEX Developmental Birth Test Age Size AGE (Weeks) APGAR Score, Weight Infant No. (Days) (AGA or LGA)a by Exam/Datesb 1 Min/5 Min (gm) 1 ....................... 3 AGA 40/42 8/9 3,300 2 ....................... 3 AGA 39/40 8/9 2,807 3 ....................... 3 LGA 39/40 8/9 4,111 4 ....................... 1 LGA 41/40 9/9 3,912 5 ....................... 1 AGA 40/40 9/9 3,572 6 ....................... 3 LGA 40/40 9/9 4,034 7 ....................... 3 LGA 40/42 9/9 3,920 'AGA: appropriate for gestational age, LGA: large for gestational age (based on birth weight, length, and head circumference). b Based on developmental assessment of physical maturity and time since conception.</page><page sequence="4">Myklebust and Gottlieb 1039 muscles. To quantify the degree of simulta- neous (or near-simultaneous) activation of the antagonists, we computed the ratio of the peak-to-peak, stretch-evoked EMG voltages, or the TA/SOL reflex ratio for Achilles ten- don taps (Myklebust et al., 1982, 1986), and the HAM/QUAD reflex ratio for patellar ten- don taps (Myklebust et al., 1986). Results In the healthy adult, a tap to the Achilles tendon evokes a stereotypic synchronous burst of EMG in the stretched soleus muscle at short (monosynaptic and polysynaptic) la- tency of 35-40 ms. In this interval, relative electrical silence is observed in the antago- nist tibialis anterior muscle, as well as in the neighboring limb muscles quadriceps and hamstrings (Fig. 2). This pattern reflects the unique, strong, and monosynaptic nature of this reflex (Burke, Gandevia, &amp; McKeon, 1984; Magladery &amp; McDougal, 1950). The latency and waveform of the EMG response are very stable on successive taps (Mykle- bust, 1986). The ratio of the peak-to-peak EMG response measured in the TA and SOL muscles (i.e., the TA/SOL reflex ratio) was calculated for each tap. This ratio is usually less than 0.1 in the normal adult (e.g., from Fig. 2, (0.15 mVTA)/(3.6 mVsoL = 0.042)) (Myklebust et al., 1982, 1986). This means that the tendon jerk reflexes are at least 10 times greater in the tapped muscle than in its antagonist. Similarly, in response to a pa- tellar tendon tap, the HAM/QUAD reflex ra- tio is also usually less than 0.1 in the normal adult. In healthy newborns, tendon jerk reflex responses are significantly different from those in the adult. There are monosynaptic latency EMG responses in agonist, antago- nist, and neighboring limb muscles, with greater trial-to-trial variability in the ampli- tude and latency of these evoked responses (Myklebust, 1986). Figure 3 is a composite graph from one infant illustrating typical sets of four EMG recordings from the limb muscle groups (gastrocnemius-soleus, tibialis ante- rior, quadriceps, and hamstrings) in re- sponse to three sequential Achilles tendon taps. The amplitude of the response (and the absence of muscle activity) is variable among successive tendon taps. That is, the first tap may evoke a reflex from the agonist and antagonist muscles, while the neigh- boring muscles are quiet; the next tap may evoke reflex responses from agonist and neighboring muscles, while the antagonist muscle is quiet; and the following tap may evoke a response from the neighboring limb muscles, and none from the agonist muscle. The results for seven infants are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The key feature of these data is that while the SOL amplitudes in Ta- ble 2 and QUAD amplitudes in Table 3 are not unexpected responses to the delivered stimuli, all the other amplitudes would, in a normal adult, be very close to zero. The average of the individual response ratios is shown, not the ratio of the averages.

Note that QUAD and HAM latencies are shorter. This is consistent with a shorter neural con- duction path from the tapped SOL muscle to the responding HAM and QUAD muscles. Conversely, latencies of HAM and QUAD muscles following patellar tendon taps were monosynaptic, while latencies of SOL and TA muscles were longer. Discussion The data confirm and expand our previ- ous findings about lower limb reflexes in a different, larger population of newborns. Compared to healthy adults, newborns differ in at least four significant ways: (1) The mean TA/SOL reflex ratios for Achilles ten- don taps, and the mean HAM/QUAD reflex ratios for patellar tendon taps, are higher for newborns. (2) Sequential reflexes are more variable in latency, amplitude, and wave- form (see Fig. 3). (3) There is more variabil- ity in the relative excitability of the agonist and antagonist muscles that is not related to state of consciousness of the infant. (4) A ten- don tap can evoke short-latency EMG re- sponses from neighboring, as well as antago- nist, muscles. These results demonstrate that the difference between adult and the newborn reflex response to a tendon tap is not merely excitation of agonist and antago- nist muscles (i.e., reciprocal excitation). It is broader and better characterized as reflex irradiation to neighboring limb muscles. These observations are quite similar to a re- cent report on reflexes in the upper limbs of newborns, children, and adults (O'Sullivan et al., 1991). The origin of the variability could be due to many factors. These include variabil- ity in contraction levels of muscles of the leg just prior to the tap to the limb, variability of the excitability of the sensory receptors (muscle spindles), the variability resulting from incomplete myelination of the reflex pathways, the variability of synaptic connec- tions, and the variability of descending in- puts from higher centers. Despite the similarity of the infants to each other by clinical (developmental and neurological) examination, there are signifi- cant differences in reflex responses recorded 1 Anthropomorphic data on neonates give the rump-to-sole distance as 23.1 ? 1.9 to 28.8 ? 2.6 cm in 40 week gestation infants (Snyder et al., 1977). Nerve conduction studies for the tibial nerve of term infants are 25.8 + 2.0 to 28.8 + 2.0 m/sec (Goeshchen, Purta, Rothe, &amp; Saling, 1983; Schulte, 1978). The resulting approximate conduction time from the ankle to the lumbar spine and back [(2 x 23.1 cm/28.8 m/sec to 2 x 28.8 cm/25.8 m/sec] is 16 to 22 ms.</page><page sequence="6">Myklebust and Gottlieb 1041 Achilles Tendon Taps to All Neonates 10 OJ 1 0 0.1 eD 0.01 1 2 3 4 5 6 "State" of Consciousness FIG. 4.-TA/SOL reflex ratios for Achilles tendon taps to infants, plotted with respect to "state of consciousness" (Brazelton, 1973): state 1: deep sleep, no movement, regular breathing; state 2: light sleep, eyes shut, rapid eye movement, irregular respiration, some limb movements; state 3: drowsy or semidozing, eyes opening and closing, activity variable, movements usually smooth; state 4: awake, alert, with bright look, eyes open, minimal motor activity; state 5: wide awake, periodic vigorous movement; state 6: crying. by EMG of the leg muscles. Moreover, the variability in reflex responses between in- fants is as great as the variability in reflex responses within an infant. Three possible mechanisms might pro- duce irradiation of responses: 1. Volume conduction of the electrical signal to remote-recording electrodes (My- klebust et al., 1982): Volume conduction of electrical signals is a passive and stable phenomenon. An electrical signal, like the EMG, attenuates rapidly with distance; an EMG electrode that is remote from the excit- able tissue always records a smaller signal than the electrode that directly overlies the stretched muscle. That is, following an Achilles tendon tap and stretch of the SOL muscle, the muscle activity recorded at the SOL electrode will always be larger than at any other electrode on the limb that is pick- ing up volume-conducted EMG activity from the SOL muscle. This is not the case in our studies: for Achilles tendon taps, the TA EMG is often larger than the SOL EMG, and SOL responses can be as large following Achilles taps as patellar tendon taps. These findings cannot be explained by volume con- duction alone. Second, when an electrical signal is vol- ume conducted through a "constant" me- dium (i.e., the leg of the infant remains un- changed during the test), the differences in waveform characteristics (amplitudes and la- tencies of EMG activity) between any two recording electrodes should be constant (as long as the electrodes are not moved). That is, the onset time and shape of the EMG sig- nal at the SOL electrode should always have the same relation to those waveform charac- teristics at the TA electrode, with each and every tap. Examination of individual EMG records fails to demonstrate this consistency. Third, volume conduction is a passive property of the material in which the electri- cal signal is transmitted. Therefore, the vol- ume conduction of the SOL signal to the TA electrode is the same as the volume conduc- tion of the TA signal to the SOL electrode. If volume conduction were the only property responsible for the data, then the relation between agonist versus antagonist EMG waveform should always be the same, re- gardless of the tap site. Furthermore, the on- set latency differences between the agonist and antagonist muscles would be constant from trial to trial at each tap site; this is not the case in any one infant. Moreover, the onset latency differences at neighboring muscles should be constant from trial to trial</page><page sequence="7">o n03Ol Mtt m q1 c I +1 +1 +1 +1 +1?t +1 t +1 3pl 4?C ,c 1+1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 cq -q P4 P- C I---4-4 't M l CO)00 OC1 IcI0Cdo D0 ~I -c 0 t - 10k -1 cl -4 cl 4 cl in li c i Ci l - tC-k C3d rO~L &gt;1 14 cli cl V cj i +1 +1 +1+1+ +1+1 +1 H =d 0)~ +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 m 0 C1 0 0O 00 01 E- --4 n t- co0 c ?c =d z t- -q 00 Cco cq in ~ Li 4 C6 4 oi 4 to Itt 01 i~ ~ n CO)c z ; ces 4 z H z c t- C i n0 -04 00 S+I +I +I +I +I +I +1 0 co -4 q C? -; C cq c cqco c ?cm + +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 0 tt co in in ?c r- cq l ') 1 c ?

(See Fig. 3: QUAD and HAM EMGs are at variable latencies following successive Achilles taps, despite consistency in onset latencies in TA EMGs.) For these reasons, volume conduction of muscle signals is neither a sufficient nor a likely explanation of our data. However, the exclusive role of volume conduction in these data cannot be assessed, and it cannot be excluded as a contributing factor. 2. Mechanical dispersion of the stimu- lus to neighboring muscles (Myklebust et al., 1982): With each mechanical tap of a ten- don, vibration is mechanically transmitted from the tap site through the rest of the limb. If this vibration is intense enough, it may stimulate the muscle spindles of all the mus- cles in the leg and produce a reflex response. Taps to a bony prominence, like the medial malleolus, should be much more effective at causing a vibration of the leg than taps to soft tissue, like a tendon. However, EMG signals from all limb muscles were always significantly smaller when we tapped the medial malleolus than when we tapped a tendon (Myklebust et al., 1986). While we cannot exclude the contribution of vibration of the limb in evoking muscle responses at recording sites other than from the agonist muscle, our data do not substantiate this mechanism as the primary contribution to the EMG signals recorded from distant elec- trodes. 3. A neural mechanism that includes segmental circuitry (see Fig. 1). While we cannot absolutely exclude the possibility that volume conduction and mechanical dis- persion may contribute to the signals we record in the infant, it is unlikely that the widespread reflex EMGs recorded in these infants are explainable solely by these phe- nomena. Unlike volume conduction and mechan- ical dispersion, the functional spinal cord circuitry that we call "reflex irradiation" is capable of explaining the reflex responses in all of the limb muscles following stretch to any one of those muscles. In this model of the infant's stretch reflex, we hypothesize that there exist multiple excitatory connec- tions across one or more spinal levels, link- ing muscles at one or more joints. In ad- dition, these pathways may have labile synaptic thresholds, and may be modu- lated by immature descending supraspinal signals. Anatomically, it is not unreasonable to presume that there are simple reflex connec- tions between muscles of the calf and the thigh (Eccles &amp; Lundberg, 1958). The in- nervations of the gastrocnemius-soleus mus- cle (by the tibial nerve), the tibialis anterior (by the common peroneal nerve), and the hamstrings muscles (by the sciatic nerve) are all derived from the L4-5 and S1-2 spinal levels (and S3 for the tibial nerve). The quadriceps innervation (from the femoral nerve) is slightly higher, at L2-4. We suggest that intersegmental neural circuits may exist between lumbar segments in the infant, or the reflex transmission may be at the L4 level, which is common to all these limb muscles. Functionally, it is also reasonable to ex- pect that some interaction exists between calf and thigh muscles in the infant. For ex- ample, the gastrocnemius and hamstrings muscles are both knee flexors. That they can be activated simultaneously by a reflex path- way does not seem unlikely. Furthermore, many of the infant's vol- untary limb movements are performed in a synergy; that is hip, knee, and ankle flexion occur together in some kicking movements (Thelen, 1985). The gastrocnemius muscle is an ankle extensor, and the quadriceps muscle is a knee extensor. That gastrocne- mius and quadriceps can be activated si- multaneously in spontaneous kicking and by reflex tendon tap also seems reasonable. Thelen and Fisher (1983) also demonstrated that, in infants, kicks are often initiated by strong, phasic activation of hip and ankle flexor muscles, and by coactivation of antag- onist muscle groups, including tibialis ante- rior and gastrocnemius muscles. The coacti- vation of antagonist muscles is a property of spontaneous leg movements, as well as re- flex responses in the infant. If reciprocal excitation and reflex irradi- ation accurately describe the functional spi- nal cord circuitry of the infant, the question remains about the changes that must occur in childhood for the development of the adult pattern of the stretch reflex pathway. Studies of development in animals have not reported changes in spinal cord circuitry that would explicitly support our hypotheses; however, reorganization of the connectivity in the cerebral cortex (Stanfield, 1984) and at the neuromuscular junction (Bagust, Lewis, &amp; Westerman, 1973; O'Brien, Ost- berg, &amp; Vrbova, 1978) has been reported in</page><page sequence="9">1044 Child Development TA/SOL REFLEX RATIOS FOR ACHILLES TENDON TAPS FOR HEALTHY CHILDREN 3 .... ............................................................................................... ....................................................... 09 O0 man TA/SOL 0 for 1 infant: O 1.62 1.47 0 mean TA/SOL O0 O for healthy adults: minimum O O0.080.04 man TA/SOL o 1 2 o * * a o o * 1for l infant: 0 .. . . .

For comparison, the mean TA/SOL reflex ratio for healthy adults and the maximum and minimum TA/SOL reflex ratios for individual infants are also illustrated. the postnatal period of cats and rats. In addi- tion, plasticity of the spinal cord via activa- tion of previously ineffective synapses in adult decerebrate spinal rats has been pro- posed by Wall (1988). While there are very few data on the re- flex patterns in healthy children, prelimi- nary studies of both lower and upper limbs (Myklebust, 1986; O'Sullivan et al., 1991) suggest that the pattern of EMG evoked by reflex irradiation is extinguished during the first year of life. This may be of significance in the control of the legs, as this is the time when children begin independent ambula- tion. Reflexes appear to become more fo- cused with maturation, with suppression of reflex irradiation. Previous work from this laboratory (Fig. 5) shows that reciprocal ex- citation persists as an identifiable reflex pat- tern until 4 to 6 years, but the reflex ratios fall significantly during the first year. These data about infants and children suggest that functional spinal circuitry may be modulated in concert with the develop- ment of motor coordination in the lower ex- tremities. This "motor control" includes the ability of the child to make independent joint movements, and to execute coordinated tasks involving multiple joint segments of the limbs, as in walking. If the changes in spinal pathways in children are correlated in time and related to the development of limb motor control, then it is also possible that the neural pathways must mature before nor- mal motor coordination is possible. Alterna- tively, it may be that the development of normal motor coordination causes the changes in spinal circuitry. Possibly, the fail- ure to abolish functional reflex irradiation is contributory to the deficits of voluntary movement in cerebral palsy. In any case, knowledge that stretch re- flex patterns gradually change in early child- hood makes it reasonable that the complex segmental circuitry of reciprocal excitation and reflex irradiation exists in the infant, and that these pathways are subjected to modula- tion during normal growth and develop- ment. The monitoring of these reflex pat- terns is not possible by clinical examination, but only by electrical recordings. Such mon- itoring should be considered, at least for children at risk for motor disorders. References Bagust, J., Lewis, D. M., &amp; Westerman, R. A. (1973).
