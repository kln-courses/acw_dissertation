Contact: rs10009@cam.ac.uk]  This volume brings together nine essays that originated in a workshop held  at the University of Munich in 2008. All papers deal with aspects of the  cultural history of a particular animal species across a wide source base  ranging from antiquity through to the Qing period. The focus, its editor  notes in the introduction, is not so much on human-animal relationships  but the animal “of itself” (an sich). The result is a series of essays rich in  detail, annotation and description, illustrated with sixteen plates.   Thomas Kaiser (‘Unsterblich problematisch: Grus japonensis’) examines  the morphology, taxonomy, and ecology of the bird referred to today as the  dandinghe 丹頂鶴, also known as the Manchurian, Japanese or red-crowned  crane, and one among four other crane species present in China. His survey  reviews a number of names for the crane that appear in historical sources  and that, each in their own way, associate the crane with the themes of  longevity and immortality. Chronology does not lie at the heart of the  analysis. The essay moves from the eleventh century reconstructed  Xianghejing 相鸖經 (“Classic on the Physiognomy of the Crane”), to (W.  Han) Huainanzi 淮南子, to the Shang tomb of Lady Fuhao 婦好, the famous  Mawangdui 馬王堆 banner, to examples of fifteenth and nineteenth cen- tury paintings figuring cranes. Yet, throughout Kaiser shows that proving  correspondence between Grus japonensis and names of crane-type avians in  texts or their representations in art remains highly problematic. Indeed the  identification of biological species with nomenclature and the absence of  neat correspondences between biological creatures and the animal lexicon  run as a red thread through all essays in this volume. Mathias Röder (‘Vom  kopfüber Hängenden oder daoguaniao’) examines textual references to a  bird of the parrot family referred to as the daoguaniao 倒掛鳥 “hanging  bird”. He traces the earliest references to hanging birds to Song times,  reviews possible variant terms, and discusses its curiously attributed habit  of “collecting fragrance” (shou xiang 收香). At the core of the analysis again  119  </page> <page sequence="2"> 130                                                                                                  EASTM 39 (2014)    are reservations as to the exact referent species that hides behind the  multiple variants referring to hanging birds across multiple sources: poetry,  local gazetteers, etc. Roderick Ptak (Weiße Papageien in frühen chines- ischen Quellen bis zur Tang-Zeit) surveys candidate species that might  correspond to the terms baiyingwu 白鸚鵡 (the survey stretches beyond  Tang sources). Ptak suggests that the term most frequently refers to the  cockatoo, a species imported from Southeast Asia, possibly as early as Han  and therefore quintessentially “exotic.” We are treated to a list of references  to parrots and related talking birds that appear as part of tribute missions  up to the Yuan and some literary anecdotes in conclusion. In a second piece  (‘Notizen zum Mungo, Herpestes javanicus’) Professor Ptak collates  references to the menggui 蒙貴/mengsong 蒙頌 (mongoose) and its cognates  by way of annotating an eighteenth century description of the animal in the  Aomen jilüe 澳門記略 . An encyclopaedic survey of references follows  starting with the Shijing 詩經. In conclusion, the author reiterates that  mongoose-type creatures were known in Macao long before the description  in Aomen jilüe, but, again, he insists that it is doubtful whether its compilers  knew what it looked like or had ever seen one; the creature belonged as  much as anything to a textual world of mirabilia. References to the cat (mao  貓) are reviewed in an essay by Shing Müller (Über die mao-Katzen im  alten China), who concludes and confirms, independently from a previous  study by Timothy Barrett, that, as domesticated pets, cats appear late in the  Chinese record.1 By the sixth century CE cats were still documented mostly  as catchers of vermin or demonic entities. Barring some exceptions, it is not  until the ninth century CE and into Song times that they appear, in texts  and visual culture, as members of the domestic sphere, albeit that the  domestic cat never took centre stage as a theme in texts and art. Müller’s  piece, very usefully, not only traces evidence in texts but also makes  reference to zoo-archaeological reports. 2  Chiara Bocci writes about the  leopard (‘Il leopardo nell’antica Cina fra danze sciamaniche e stendardi’).                                                             1  See Timothy Barrett, The Religious Affiliations of the Chinese Cat: An Essay  Towards an Anthropozoological Approach to Comparative Religion (The Louis Jordan  Occasional Papers in Comparative Religion; 2), London: School of Oriental and  African Studies, 1998; acknowledged by Müller in the introduction and on p.67.

The  appearance of leopards (and tiger-like creatures) in the Nine Songs (Jiu ge  九歌) then lead to symbolism and theories of shamanism, which make up  the body of the paper. Bocci links snippets of information about the leopard  to shamanic practices documented in Altaic cultures and elsewhere. A  reference in Taiping yulan 太平御覽  (983 CE) to the leopard’s habit of  turning its head towards a mountain upon death (shou shan 首山), Bocci  speculates, could connect the motif of the head and mountains to the world  of the spirits, and explain images of leopards as transitory conduits or  guardians of the spirit world. Mention is also made of the use of the  apotropaic leopard-skin cushion (bao zhen 豹枕), the link of the pelt to  imagery of transformation, and references to leopard-tailed spirit beings.  Bocci’s piece is rich in cross-cultural references and theories that straddle  different times and places. But her study also shows how hard it is to go  beyond conjecture and speculation when texts remain largely silent on  sightings and descriptions of an animal. In an essay on the hedgehog (‘Auf  den Spuren des ‘Königs der Tiger’: Erwähnungen von Igeln in alten  chinesischen Texten [Han bis Ming]‘) Marc Nürnberger also goes beyond  the issue of nomenclature. He discusses hedgehog lore and imagery, the  use of the hedgehog and its spiny hairs in medicine, its function as a  repeller of insects, and its appearance in dreams and omenology.  Nürnberger makes the wise comment that, in examining an animal species,  one should not limit one’s reach to simple keyword searches and be led by  terminology only. Raimund Kolb writes about the zifang 虸蚄 (Oriental  armyworm) and delves into the history of combatting the plagues they  cause (‘Das vormoderne Wissen von den zifang und die Bekämpfung ihrer  Plagen’). A brief introduction to the modern biology of the so-called  nianchong 黏蟲 is followed by an excursus into the history of nomenclature,  and observations of their behaviour in historical sources. Kolb offers a spot- on critique of the methods used by many historians to arrive at historical  statistics of insect plagues: numbers are mostly based on official histories  that are sanctioned by the court, and many scholars simply overlook the  fact that the reporting of plagues and the concealment of natural disasters  were highly politicised events, as they were often seen to occur in response  to practical and moral failures by local officials. Amidst the impressive  detail displayed throughout the essays in this volume, Professor Kolb puts  up a very important caveat as to how we are to elicit information from our  sources: a cultural history of animals in China should not be dominated  either by an exclusive focus on nomenclature or by unverifiable statistics    </page> <page sequence="4"> 132                                                                                                  EASTM 39 (2014)    culled from official sources. Martin Moser (‘Der chinesische Flußdelphin  baiji in alter Literatur’) deals with the river dolphin, now functionally  extinct, but known as baiji 白鱀 (Lipotes vexillifer) from Song times at least.3  First described at some length in Guo Pu’s 郭璞 (276-324 CE) commentary  to the Erya 爾雅, the paper zooms in on a description of the creature in the  poetry of Kong Wuzhong 孔武仲 (1041-1097), and the section dealing with  dolphins in Li Shizhen’s 李時珍 (1518-1593) Bencao gangmu. Sources from  the Ming onward indicate the term haitun 海豚 may also have applied to  the Yangzi river dolphin, though not exclusively. The paper concludes with  a metamorphosis story in Liaozhai zhiyi 聊齋志異, and with an acknow- ledgement, echoing a sentiment emphasized by most contributors, that it is  impossible to establish with certainty what species or subspecies is referred  to in descriptions of dolphin-like creatures.  What unites these essays is the thoroughness of detail displayed in the  collation of textual references to this particular set of animals. The majority  of contributors focus on the occurrence of varying animal terminology and  its annotation. The central concern here is, firstly, with reconstructing a  semantic field of nomenclature (“das gesamte Begriffsfeld”, p. 29) across  different sources and, secondly, the questions of whether and how these  terms can refer to a particular biologically identifiable or attested species.  This is, of itself, extremely valuable work, and, in the age of digital texts,  this type of analysis will no doubt continue, leading to more comprehen- sive surveys of animal nomenclature based on entries in encyclopaedia,  gazetteers, leishu, etc. What this volume drives home again and again is  confirmation that the modalities in which traditional Chinese animal  nomenclature denote species are extremely complex: names change and  adapt; names cover more than one or whole series of species; names vary  regionally; existing or familiar names are applied to non-familiar or  exogenous species in different times, etc., etc. In addition terminological  variants can arise depending on whether or not an author or observer  shares a personal history with a species’ habitat, or whether reports are  witness accounts that follow direct observation or simply a rehash of  earlier textual records. The authors have done an excellent job in reminding  us that animal nomenclature hinge on multiple referents, including biology  and chronology, regional specificity and shared abstractions.  But these studies also illustrate that, in our attempt to write cultural  histories of animals in China, there are limits to what lexicographical  description can tell us about animals or the lived experience of animals in  the past. By focusing on annotating (“rectifying”) species terminology in                                                             3 See also Samuel T.

At the  other extreme, the selective use or oversight of certain texts together with  erroneous readings can replicate through layers of commentary until an  animal name is accepted as the uncontested referent to a particular species.4  Another issue is whether the interrogation of texts is a sufficient source and,  more importantly, whether it is possible at all to study animals “an sich”,  since many of the creatures referred to in texts are, partly at least, human  constructs, textual representations, or act as images and metaphors ad- duced to serve an anthropocentric or anthropomorphic agenda. I doubt  that it is possible to separate material found in literary texts from so-called  zoologically relevant texts (“zoologisch relevante Kompendien”, p. 41), as  some papers in this volume intimate. Who makes the distinction between  these “genres” and on what grounds? Some of the contributors question  this assumption of their own accord or implicitly invalidate it. Raimund  Kolb for instance speaks of a “nomenklatorische Wirrwarr (messiness)” in  pre-modern zoology in China, but he also notes that the arrival of modern  zoology and entomology did not necessarily bring taxonomic clarity. In  quoting a Song poem about the river dolphin, Martin Moser shows that  poetry can be more zoologically revealing than “natural history” (p. 171).   It may be tempting, perhaps even comforting, for the sinologist to side  with etymology, lexicography, or the study of nomenclature when writing  about animals. Yet, as much as good philology should be a non-negotiable  tool in the writing of a cultural history of animals, it will probably take  some time and more training for sinologists to take stock of the findings in  zoo-archaeology and natural science with equal confidence. I also expect  that our readings of animals in the Chinese past will increasingly benefit  from insights in the social sciences, psychology, and ethology. Recent years  have seen a surge of work in the interdisciplinary field of human-animal  studies.5 For the Chinese case to be part of this field and for its sources to be  made accessible to non-sinologists, it will prove necessary for us not only  to push our analysis beyond philology and the identification of  nomenclature, but also to bring the human-animal relationship more to the                                                             4 For an example of the consequences of misidentification, see Donald Harper’s  excellent study of the mo 貘/*mâk, one of the giant panda’s ancient names, which  Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat (1788–1832) erroneously entered as the “Chinese tapir” in  19th century zoological literature.

After all, the essays brought together in this volume  show that historical zoology and taxonomy are a human science much in  the same way as “touring the cages of a zoo is to understand the society  that erected them.”6                                                                   6  Eric Baratay and Elisabeth Hardouin-Fugier, Zoo: A History of Zoological  Gardens in the West, London: Reaktion Books, 2002, p. 13.  </page> </plain_text>
