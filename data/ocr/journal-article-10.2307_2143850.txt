<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD E VERYWHERE one looks, today, over the field of cur- rent legal scholarship one sees evidences, if only scattered, of an earnest desire and a diligent effort to apply to this the most traditional of all social arts that method for the advancement of understanding which we have come to associate with modern science. Until recently this movement was most conspicuous on the Continent-less so in England. Today its most promising, if not its most advanced, sector seems to be in the United States. To one, like myself, whose training has -been -in the " exact sciences" and who views this movement as a part of the general drive to apply the methods of these exact sciences to the whole subject of society, the somewhat toddling first steps in the field of law are most sympathetic. It becomes, therefore, a matter of deep concern to such an outsider when he perceives that progress along this line is being held up, not only by the very real obstacles that are necessarily present, but even more so, on the one hand, by what seems to be a widespread misunderstand- ing of the nature of scientific method, and, on the other hand, by a conventional view of the character of legal material, which renders it almost incapable of being dealt with by such method. Since these latter obstacles are wholly unreal and exist only in the minds of those whose ways of thinking have been formed in the peculiarly non-scientific channels of traditional legal training, they are susceptible of being con- jured away by treatment. What follows is an attempt to "lay these ghosts ". It must be admitted at the outset that one insuperable obstacle sets a definite limit to this movement. The law is primarily a system of value judgments applied to human conduct. In spite of benevolent endeavors to expand its d-o- main, it is quite clear, I think, to most scientists that science does not and cannot determine the judgment of values. Values 496</page><page sequence="2">No. 4] THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 497 depend on what (or which) we want. Science may aid us in getting what we want; it may clarify for us the actual alternatives between which we may choose; it may show us the " costs " of our choices; it may predict for us their conse- quences. All these contributions may aid us in making judg- ments which will actually lead to what we prefer; but they cannot decide for us what it is that we prefer. It follows that no application of scientific method can furnish the ethical code which a system of law expresses. All it can do is to expose the " expository " branch of jurisprudence, as Bentham called it, and thus incidentally to act as an aid and abettor of the " censorial " branch.' We will return later to the question of the way in which a science of law might be applied for this purpose when we have, to the best of our ability, disposed of the two major unnecessary obstacles to the creation of any science of law at all. It is not difficult to account for the prevalence of the mis- understanding of scientific method which one finds among these legal laymen-for lawyers are very " lay" in this re- spect. In default of training and experience in scientific procedure in the fields in which such procedure has actually worked and is working, legal scholarship-or such part of it as, is interested in promoting this movement-seems to have expected to find the recipes for its methodological tactics in the generalizations of the " philosophy of science ". Now this recent postscript to philosophy in general is no more than an accesssory after the fact, attempting somewhat tardily to an- alyze how all this scientific progress has been accomplished and thus, by expanding or adapting epistemology to the post- Baconian development, to bring that particular branch of philosophy up to date. But this new philosophy has invented no tactics; it has applied no tactics; it is hardly even concerned with tactics. Its vital concern has been to prove that the puta- tive grand strategy of science, conceived as a magnificent out- flanking of the unknowable, is an imposture. Quite different 1 As to the probable adequacy of such a seemingly partial development, the reader may consult the present writer's comments in The Institution of Prop- erty (New York and Toronto, I936), pp. 22-23, n. 25 and 29.</page><page sequence="3">498 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV and apart from all this is what Jerome Frank calls " the spirit of the creative scientist ". That spirit had and has little of such self-consciousness-it is more naive, if you will. It is experimental, exploratory. It does not lay down in advance a scheme for the grand strategy. In fact few of the men on the firing line have ever given a thought to the matter of this grand strategy. They are too busy with tactics to concern themselves with strategy at all. They only know that their tactics " work "; and that is enough to justify them. But it is they alone who devise and apply tactics; and it is from them alone that tactics can be learned. I conceive that it is largely because they have looked to the wrong source for sugges- tions as to the way to begin their attack that many of the legal scholars who are inclined scientifically seem to have spent their time studying and discussing methodology-trying to decide how to start, instead of taking the first steps-or studying and discussing the underlying philosophy of a legal science-trying to start at the end instead of the beginning. Another and even more disastrous effect of this somewhat malign philosophic influence has been to inculcate the idea among these would-be-beginners that the only "creative" and " true " science is a " science of generalizations", as op- posed to mere " descriptive science ". This antithesis is wholly invalid as well as invidious. Moreover, it has the baneful practical effect of causing those who hope to lay the founda- tions of a science in the field of law-or any other field-to be impatient of the " maze " which is the only entrance to any science-that anteroom where at first one seems to get no- where. By seeming to promise a " royal road ", which nevertheless does not exist, such an antithesis comes perilously near to closing the gate to the only road there is-a true de- scriptive science. I suppose it would be quite generally agreed that the phrase "descriptive science" is intended to indicate the collection and examination of the data in any field for the purpose of naming, defining and classifying them-taxonomy. Now this is actually a succinct and accurate statement of the one method which all science follows and must follow in dealing with any</page><page sequence="4">No. 4] THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 499 subject matter. It is not to be supposed that plants had no names before Karl von Linne. Yet the enduring reputation of this founder of systematic botany. (and zoology) rests on the fact that he was the first to give each species a single and specific name and to define the principles upon which natural history still classifies its subject matter. The scientific attack consists primarily in organizing the data. This organizing begins by identifying the identical or nearly identical indi- viduals of a variety by means of discovering and describing their essential distinguishing features.2 The resulting de- scription, or as much of it as is needed in order to identify a variety and thus to differentiate it from all others, becomes the definition of the variety. Thereto is attached a specific name.8 If the common name happens to be exactly specific, that will serve. If it does not, then-like it or not-a new name must be applied. In the exact sciences, so called, this process has been laboriously carried through so far as existing knowledge permits. The index in my copy of Villiger's work on the anatomy of the brain consists of nearly a thousand scientific names for parts of the brain and cord, and of nothing else. A textbook of organic chemistry consists very largely of many thousands of analyzing and classifying names of molecules (varieties of substances) together with their definitions. One of the chief reasons why the social sciences are not yet exact is that, in them, this process of identifying, defining and nam- ing varieties has not been carried through.4 2 Of course no two individuals are identical; yet we "identify" varieties. 3 The name is, of course, purely a convention. I recall in college days ask- ing a classmate what day of the week it was. He replied, "Thursday." I said: " Why isn't it Sunday? I;t could just as well have been, if they had started the week with this day or had arranged the names in a different order." That idea was to him preposterous. To him the name was an insep- arable part of the thing named. This was what Jerome Frank would call "'Wousinism 4As ito the naming, it is only fair to recall the fact that the phenomena of natural science do not "call themselves " anything first, while those of social science almost always do. This creates a real terminological difficulty for the latter. For instance, what the early Roman called a "familia" and what we call by the derived name "family" have, as a matter of fact, little in com- mon; but social science continues to call both by the same name because they have both " called themselves " by that name.</page><page sequence="5">500 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV The determination of the relation of these varieties to each other, their classification or ordering, is the by-product of their identification. The double purpose is therefore better served if the adoption of a terminology for the varieties is made to fit the terminology for the classes into which they are organ- ized. Thus the chemist names the active principle of oil of mustard by the long but analytical and classifying name, " allyl-iso-sulphocyanate ". Knowing the name, he can draw the abstract diagram which has come to be used to represent the organization of the molecule and, by so naming it, he has related it automatically through his systematic classification to every other molecule which contains any one of the three radicals of which this one is composed. As a result of this previous analysis it even becomes possible for a synthetic chemist to know in advance what will be the behavior of a new molecule which he creates-a new combination of radicals which never was before on land or sea. On the other hand, classification in natural history has necessarily followed along other lines than the composition of varieties. It is, in botany, chiefly morphological-the "natural" system; it is, for the animal world, largely genealogical-a sort of evolutionary pedigree. The basis of classification must be suited to the character of the data; among the various possible criteria, that set must be chosen which seems most important; and this selection is a matter of judgment, so that classifications are modified or even replaced with the progress of knowledge. In nearly all cases the result is a hierarchy, a descending series of narrowing and somewhat parallel groupings gradually sub- dividing the whole mass of data; and in many cases the classes at each level shade into each other at their borders, just as red shades into yellow in the spectrum. Even the nicest definition leaves something arbitrary in the fixing of a dividing line. In the foregoing illustration we have been looking at some of the scientific systems of classification as if they were faits accomplis. However, if we examine more deeply into the way in which these objectives are pursued, we will see that the technique of classifying, defining and naming-or organizing the material-is a process which embraces-or is the result</page><page sequence="6">No. 4] THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 501 of-the whole scientific procedure, and is one which is never finished. In this technique there are two methods of attack, analysis and synthesis. Analysis is the process of breaking down the data into their constituent elements, which thereby become new data. The individual datum at one level becomes analyzed into a com- pound of unlike data at the next lower level. Thus the in- dividual is found to be non-homogeneous. It is therefore no longer an individual. It becomes a crowd. Nevertheless, in the respect (at the level) in which it behaves as an entity, we continue, for convenience, to treat it as an individual. Thus we have, for different sciences-different behavior levels-a series of divisions of each whole into parts; and each part, at its level, is treated as a whole-as the individual datum, or, if there be several uniform parts, as the collective datum. To natural history, man; to ethnology, the race; to political science, the nation; to medicine, a man; to anatomy, the organ of a man; to cytology, the cell of an organ; to physiological chemistry, the protein of a cell; to chemistry, the atom of the protein molecule; to physics, the electron of this atom. All these are successively analyzed parts or constituents of natural history's man. Now when we look back we see that, in such analysis, science has been depositing a classification in each of this series of strata. As soon as we distinguish between the parts, individual or collective, we have classified them. To divide man into the races of man and the races of man, in turn, into nations is to choose some bases of distinction, some criteria for these classifications. It is to divide something that was at first treated as if it were homogeneous into parts which are thereby treated as heterogeneous. It is to choose at each level a respect in which there is homogeneity as the criterion of a whole (an entity) and a respect in which there is hetero- geneity as the criterion of parts-the entities of the next lower level. Therefore, analysis is also classification-the breaking down of the whole into classes or parts. And the basis of analysis is the choice of a criterion according to which we distinguish these classes.5 5 It should be noted that, in most fields of analysis, these criteria are more</page><page sequence="7">502 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV We say we classify by putting likes together in a group and separating unlikes into separate groups. This man has done naively from the beginning. One of the difficulties in the road of science is the inclination to continue to do it more or less naively. Thus, today, ethnology suffers from having based its classifications on distinctions (brachy- and dolicho- cephalic indices) that turn out not to be accurate differentia- tions. One school of psychology ran off the track when it endeavored to distinguish two classes of men according to two contrasting tendencies, introversion and extraversion, in both of which all shared and even in different degrees at different times. One may suspect that this naYvete is a feature of tradi- tional legal classifications; and this may explain some of the present dissatisfaction with them. If, then, analysis includes both putting likes together and separating unlikes-that is, classification-what is synthesis? If the dividing of unlikes has as its necessary obverse the grouping of likes, why use two terms for what are merely the two aspects of a single process? Evidently that is not the distinction which the names analysis and synthesis are in- tended to convey. We have said that analysis is the break- ing down of data. By that we suggest that analysis is a matter of direction. It is starting with wholes and breaking them down into parts which are heterogeneous in some respect among themselves and homogeneous in that respect within themselves. It is classification of the broader into the nar- precise if stated in terms of the systems of relationship which exist between each particular entity and other entities at its own level, than if they are stated in terms of the constitution of the entity itself. And this because the constitution at any level includes that of all lower levels. In that respect no whole can be different from its parts. Nor can it be defined except in terms of its parts. On the other hand, the *system of external relationships differs at each level and is therefore more definitive. By "systems of external relation- ship" should be understood more particularly functional relations (behavior) but also static arrangement in a pattern of external relata and comparative morphology. The criterion for distinguishing the heart from the liver may in- clude all counts; that for distinguishing arms from legs must be chiefly func- tional, hardly at all morphological and not at all topological. On the other hand, the criterion for distinguishing islands from peninsulas is wholly topo- logical; and that for distinguishing cones from spheres is wholly morpho- logical.</page><page sequence="8">No. 41 THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 503 rower. In the hierarchy of classifications it works from the higher to the lower. So examined, synthesis turns out to be merely classification in the opposite direction-from the nar- rower to the broader, from the hierarchically lower to the higher, the combining of hitherto isolated parts into new wholes.' If analysis is dividing one into one third and two thirds, which are unlikes, synthesis is " putting two and two [likes] together ". Now, curiously enough, it is much easier and pleasanter for the human mind to find likenesses than it is to find unlikenesses.7 Synthesis is much more interesting than analysis. The seeing of some hitherto unnoticed re- semblance that serves as the basis for a new grouping into a more nearly all-embracing class is the kind of scientific insight which excites the seer and occasionally rocks the world. Dar- win's theory of evolution consisted essentially in climbing up the hierarchy of varieties, species, genera, etc., with a new criterion which united into one system the hitherto mutually independent aborigines of " creation ". The detection of the likeness between voluntary and involuntary behavior was the grand synthesis of Freud. On the other hand, it is the hasty or the premeditated synthesis which is the prejudicial synthesis for science. Those interested in the application of scientific method to law would do well to review the early history of natural sciences to see how much that was false and hindering in the way of synthesis had to be sloughed off before they 6 Again, we may remind the reader, Ithe criteria for synthesis-the "resem- blance " referred to below-include systems of external relationship. Thus the "law" of gravity is stated in terms of a functional relation between any two bodies, a topological relation to each other (square of the distance) but no longer that to space from a particular viewpoint (falling) and a comparative morphological relation (mass). But the criterion of synthesis, in contrast to that of analysis, is as frequently and as precisely in terms of constitution. And this because the deeper the level to which analysis reaches the more generalized is the constitution, and the greater the probability of hitherto un- recognized uniformities. When the physicist discovers that the suns and planets are made of the same "stuff " as the earth, and, glancing "from earth to heaven ", he "bodies forth the forms of things unknown" "and gives to airy nothing a local habitation anid a name ", the synthesis is in terms of con- stitution. 7 For instance, to the unaccustomed eye all Chinamen look alike; the de- light of the novice is to find the patterns in which " history repeats itself ".</page><page sequence="9">504 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV really got their starts and became fruitful. Almost it may be said that the unexpected synthesis is the only one of permanent value. Such syntheses arise, it is true, from the discovery of hitherto undiscovered likenesses, but their basis and oppor- tunity are almost always the result of prior analysis which, through its long laboring with details, has disclosed a con- stituent, or a part, of one whole that turns out to be homo- geneous with a constituent, or a part, of another whole. This general survey of scientific method, or, as I would prefer to call it, the organization of knowledge that science strives for,8 seems to me to demonstrate quite clearly that a ' science of generalization " consists exclusively of the classi- fications which descriptive science has built up. All general statements (generalizations) are classifications, and nothing more than that. However, if they are exact statements of fact -and therefore scientific-there can be nothing arbitrary about them. Then they are not " mere " classifications-mere taxonomy. For they must be preceded by scientific determina- tion that, in every instance included in the generalization, the constitution, the system of relations or the behavior is in the stated respect uniform. And " there's the rub ". Therefore, even if it is unconventional, it is correct and helpful to regard the whole of scientific method as a way of organizing the data and as a single process which may be pursued in either of two opposite directions-analysis or synthesis. In either direction it consists of, and is based upon, classification-the identification, definition and naming of each individual (or entity) at each level and thereby the differ- entiation of the different individuals (or entities) at that level. Everyone familiar with the exact sciences recognizes that the intensive labor of many workers for many years has gone into this organization of their material. Those who! are accus- tomed to deal with their subject matter by the usual technique of the social sciences-the so-called armchair-instead of that of the natural sciences-the laboratory and field work-do not 8 Method is, more strictly, the various means of arriving at exact knowledge of the constituent facts. However, I have been using the term, throughout, in its broader and more usual sense.</page><page sequence="10">No. 43 THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 505 seem to relish the arduous work of such analysis and synthesis. But upon this organizing ultimately rests, in all cases, the remarkable progress that man has made in dealing with ex- ternal nature. There is no " royal road " to generalization. If there is to be a science of law it must begin at the beginning. Later in this paper I shall attempt a few illustrations of what this means and a few suggestions as to how it may be done.9 The other self-imposed barrier to scientific progress in the law is the intellectual habit, to which the legally trained seem to be inured, of regarding the material of the law as a system of concepts.'" If the subject matter of law were in fact a system of concepts it might well be intractable to, or even beyond the reach of, scientific method. Practitioners of the natural or physical sciences do not seem to regard their ma- terial in this way. The natural scientist is neither a philo- sophic realist nor a conceptualist; he is pure nominalist." To 9 If anyone believes that the law is a discipline which can escape the neces- sity of exact definition and of classification, let him read J. C. Bonbright's recent treatise, The Valuation of Property (New York and London, 1932), which approaches the subject in a thoroughly scientific way. He will "re- main to pray ". 10 One result has been that the subject matter of analytical jurisprudence, which is the nearest approach the law has hitherto made to a system of classi- fication, seems to be conceived by many to consist of mere metaphysical notions, any analysis of which is purely an intellectual game. Felix Cohen (35 Col. L. Rev., p. 821) calls it a "special branch of the science of transcendental non- sense." Thus the name of that branch of the study of law which occupies the position " pure theory " would occupy in a science has come to be used as a term of opprobrium by legal practitioners and, at the moment, by many legal scholars. 11 As these terms have been used in many connections and given many inter- pretations it may be well for me to indicate what I mean by them in this connection. (i) Realism is the view that generalities have external existence and that individual instances are merely exemplifications of them; (2) concep- tualism is the view that generalities exist only in the mind, but that there they are abstracted from the concrete data or individual instances, which, in that sense, are again mere exemplifications; (3) nominalism is the view that, both externally and in the mind, generalities have no independent existence, but are merely names for convenient groupings of individual instances -though the usual representation of such groupings in the mind may be by means of, not the whole collectivity of observed instances, but a single concrete instance as type for all (Weber's "ideal type"). It is true that the most inferential entity of science assumes the form of a "conceptual model"-that is, an im-</page><page sequence="11">506 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV him the entity which he labels with a name has no other exist- ence than that of the individuals he includes thereunder. The name merely designates a grouping of more or less particular individuals and indicates the precise criteria according to which this grouping has been made. Such a view of the en- tities considered in the natural sciences seems to us, at first sight, to be quite proper for the simple reason that these en- tities concern physical objects which are visible and tangible. Yet that is not entirely correct. The atom, as an example of such an entity, is neither visible nor tangible. True, it can be weighed, and it can also be analyzed into constituent parts still more primary or elemental. But its physical existence is merely inferential, as was that of the planet Neptune after it had been inferred and before it was observed."2 It becomes necessary, therefore, on second thought, to modify our " simple reason " into this: that the data of natural science can be detected by the senses or can be inferred from sensible evidence. Can the data of law be brought within a class determined by this criterion? If such a thing were to be possible at all, it is at once clear that the avenue of approach to these data must be sought in a different direction from that in which the legalistic minded have been looking. The only possible way in which the legal material might be made subject to scientific method would be to regard it and to treat it as a part of the subject puted perceptual image-or that of an "operational concept "-that is, a con- crete experience. But the name concept is misused in both cases, for in neither has there been an " abstraction ", which may be defined as the " process of stripping an idea of its concrete accompaniments." Both are completely con- crete, though the former is pure, analogy. This is far more than a dispute about words. It goes to the root of scientific method. Of it more anon. 12 Bertrand Russell, one of the above-mentioned " accessories after the fact", takes the position (e. g., Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays [New York, I9I8], p. I55) that " logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred entities." I should say, rather, that inferred entities are to be regarded as such, and should take the form either of conceptual models or of operational concepts, whichever is more convenient. In the case of Neptune the analogy was so close that the model of a planet would naturally be used (with reserve); in the case of an electron the analogy to a particle is so doubtful that an operational concept is to be preferred. Again, we use the "benzene ring" as the model of a hydrocarbon molecule. But that is frankly a diagram and does not pretend to be realistic.</page><page sequence="12">No. 4] THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 507 matter of social science. So treated, legal data would, at least, cease to be a system of concepts. But that does not settle the matter. Even then there remains the question whether, in view of the current methods and somewhat doubt- ful results of social science, such treatment would bring legal data within the definition which we have found adequate as a criterion for the data of the natural sciences. So treated, the law would be only indirectly an affair of physical objects, men and their natural environment, which are visible and tangible. Directly, its data or material would, at best, have to be regarded as portions of human behavior, the acts of these men and the consequent relations which exist between them; and it would be these acts and relations which would require to be identified, named, defined and classified. Obviously that is a very different business from naming and classifying the birds and flowers. But is it so different that it excludes the material itself from the application of scientific method? 13 In its bearing upon the general question of the extension of the field of science from natural into social phenomena we find most appropriate the character of the data in a particular branch of science which is not educed as often as it should be as a methodological example for the others. Geology is an almost purely historical or evolutionary science. It is the physical history of the earth. During its remarkable progress it has succeeded in building a system of adequate hypotheses to explain how things have come to be as they are; and, in doing so, geology has made it possible for men to recognize certain very slow processes which have always been going on 13 In another connection Robert M. MacIver (" The Historical Pattern of Social Change", 2 Jour. Soc. Phil., p. 36) has pointed out that, if we define an entity in the social field to be " an area of human society " " which in each of its moments is a unity and in all its sequences persists through change "- and this seems to be the best definition possible-we are still confronted with the difficulty of defining " a unity ". If we choose the obvious one - the relatum, man-we become natural historians. What we are concerned with, as social scientists, is not the; relata (men) but the innumerable systems of relations that exist and persist between these relata. To define a " unity" among these is idifficult. Nevertheless it is not impossible at the simpler level we are concerned with, even if it becomes so at the level of "historical move- ments ".</page><page sequence="13">508 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV before their eyes, but which they could not even perceive until they had gained this long historical perspective. Geology is concerned with these processes and with their results rather than with the physical substances through which they become apparent to the senses. The physical substances are the lay figures or points of reference of geology, just as man and his environment are in the social sciences. Geology studies the static and dynamic relations between these substances-their structural organization and their functional behavior-just as the social sciences study the structural organization of society and the functional behavior of men in these organizations. It may be objected that this is no more than analogy. For, in the first case, the acts and relations are spatial and physical, while, in the second, they are often not. But is that distinction valid? Are not both kinds of relation alike in that they are potential, and both kinds of acts alike in that they are actual, behavior-arrangements and rearrangements-external to the observer? Are they not both alike phenomena of which the only subjective feature is the representation in the mind of the observer, to which they are conveyed in the first place by forms of perception which we call observation-as percepts, not as concepts? This suggests that the broader criterion which dis- tinguishes material subject to scientific method from that which is not is that the data so subject are originally perceived, not conceived; though the perception itself may be formed into a pattern or Gestalt. If the law deals with certain aspects of the structure and functioning-the organization and behavior-of human so- cieties, its data, since these consist of the coincident static and dynamic relations between the relata (men), are necessarily ex- ternal to the mind of the observer." The immediate repre- 14 W. W. Cook seems to me more explicit and unreserved on this point than are some of the other advocates of science in law; see 13 Am. Bar A. J., p. 308. He says "a scientific approach to the study of law will demand obser- vation and study of the actual structure and functioning of modern social, economic and political life. . .." Cassius J. Keyser (38 Yale L. J., p. 4I6) agrees that " the subject-matter of legal science is a certain species of human behavior", but then he seems to limit that species to "the decisions of the judges."</page><page sequence="14">No. 4] THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 509 sentations of these data in the mind would be, for that reason, what we call percepts, not concepts. Only the secondary or derived representations could properly be regarded as concepts. Even then they can be more accurately regarded as a kind of reorganization of the original perceptual pattern or Gestalt. To treat such derived representations as if they were abstract concepts is merely to forget their origin, to detach the ultimate picture from the reality out of which it grew. Is that not precisely what has occurred in legal thinking? Has not the law come to think of itself as dealing with thoughts, whereas in reality it deals with acts and relations? Surely the term which is used to designate a legal entity-a piece or kind of legal material-is not merely a disembodied word; it is a name. Nor is it a merely abstract term. It does not name merely a concept-a verbal or ideal construct which we credit with no existence except in the mind. It is, on the contrary, a name for a set of what, in science, we call facts-things of the existence of which we learn, not by thinking, but by watch- ing-which come into the mind first as percepts. If such a term were only a word, or if it represented merely a concept, its content or significance would be liable to the subjective and autonomous changes that are suggested in Mr. Justice Holmes's classic dictum in which he described a word as " the skin of a living thought ".15 True, the content of anything which is named does change, just as the content of that which was named Mr. Justice Holmes changed continually from birth to death. So the term for a legal entity may be applied to a datum which is now somewhat different from what it used to be. But, nevertheless, we find it possible and convenient to identify each entity by a single name throughout its changes, unless the alteration exceeds certain bounds-its criterion. 15 It seems unfair to quote the man whom Mortimer Adler says (31 Col. L. Rev., p. I07) has been placed " upon a pedestal ", as " the patron saint of realism ", by way of an awful example of verbalism or conceptualism. Never- theless it is less invidious to select as an example a vestige of the old way of thinking left in the mind of a new thinker; and this example is more appro- priate for my point since it at least concedes that there is something "livingl" behind the word. Moreover even the " realists" in general have not cured themselves of this view of the " existential reality" of concepts.</page><page sequence="15">510 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV Again, we must recognize in the former case, as in the latter, that these changes are external to the mind of the observer. True, people's views of Mr. Justice Holmes-their derived representations of him-may have changed during his life- time; so, too, people's views of any legal entity-their derived representations-may change. One may analyze a legal en- tity somewhat differently today than yesterday. But we find it convenient to distinguish between these two kinds of change alterations in the datum itself and alterations in the sec- ondary mental representation of the datum-even though we recognize that they may have a reciprocal influence on one another. After viewing the painting of a familiar landscape by a great painter we may see the landscape itself differently; but we do not assume for that reason that it has changed in the meantime. So, too, we find it convenient to differentiate between two different secondary representations arising from one indifferent percept. Hydrochloric acid, it will be agreed, is the chemical name for a sensible fact. To the laity, who in- cidentally usually use the common name " muriatic acid ", it is a substance which they know by experience, through their senses. The laity have a concept, then, which is derived from their percepts of hydrochloric acid. To them it is an acrid- smelling, burning, heavy liquid. The chemist has another concept of it, as well; he thinks of it as-even calls it-HC1. These two concepts are two different mental representations of the same datum. The first is purely sensuous, direct, almost pure percept; the second is analytical, indirect, but still derived from percepts. It may be objected that all this is beside the point, that legal data are admittedly perceptual, but that legal concepts, so called, are generalized attributes of these data, not the data themselves, and that, as such, they are wholly con- ceptual. But such a view is psychologically untenable. Our only actual percepts are just these individual attributes of our data. We see an apple as red and round. Redness and roundness are the percepts. The entity, the apple, is only the compound pattern or Gestalt in which these individual percepts are spatially and temporally organized by the perceiving ap-</page><page sequence="16">No. 4] THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 5 II paratus of the mind; the apple itself is only the imputed source of the actual percepts. It follows from this analysis that, if scientific method is to be successfully applied to law, the first step necessary will be to restore and systematize the relationship between legal en- tities-the so-called legal concepts-and the data from which as percepts they were originally derived. The data which were the source of each entity can best be recognized by re- tracing the process, of conceptualization back to the native or immediately perceptive popular system. The common language has established its own classifications for the various kinds of acts and relations with which the law deals, and has given them names, though frequently these names are not specific; one name may cover not only the act but also its consequences, the system of continuing relations which the act establishes. Purely by way of illustration, since anything definitive is here out of the question, it may elucidate this point and shed some light on the true nature of legal entities and the requirements of legal classification if we attempt to relate some legal " con- cepts ", so called, and their names, to this popular system. Let us select a few representative examples. Two or more men perform an act and thereby establish a relation, each of which is in common parlance called an " agreement ". Then the law steps in and defines a sub-class of agreements. It says, " under certain circumstances this agreement will be classified as a contract." In Roman terminology, the class of " bare pacts " is thus divided into contracts and non-contracts by the attachment of certain legal consequences (obligation) to the former. Or, again, two or more men act regularly together in some respect. Common language calls this an " associa- tion ". The law defines a sub-class. It says " under certain circumstances, this association will be classified as a corpora- tion." What the law says, in either case, does not change the nature of the datum from an external and observable fact to a legal concept or abstraction. All the law has done, if it has been rational, is to set up some observable distinction in the circumstances, according to which it defines the sub-class of the phenomenon agreement or the phenomenon association,</page><page sequence="17">5I2 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV and thus to differentiate each and to give each a name. The fact that the law attaches special consequences or sanctions to its sub-classes does not alter the data; it does not warrant the purely legalistic view that contracts or corporations are the " creations " of the law. Only the legal consequences or sanc- tions are " created " (attached) by the law. Take as another and more complex example of legal entity that class of acts which the common language calls " wrongs ". Here that other element enters which, as we noted at the be- ginning, is not directly subject to scientific method. That is the element called " value judgment "-in this case the separa- tion of " bad " from " good ", to put it in its crudest terms.-8 A wrong is presumptively a " bad " act. The law defines a sub-class of wrongs which it calls " crimes ", and subdivides these again into felonies and misdemeanors. But the entry of value judgment introduces a difficulty. If the particular set of facts-the act-which is involved in a case is held not to be a crime, is that because it does not fit into the classifica- tion " crime ", according to the legal definition; or is it be- cause the judge's (or, be it said, the jury's) direct value judg- ment upon the particular set of facts refuses to call the par- ticular act "bad" in that case? If the act is excluded both 18 It appears to me that the ultimate concern of many of the most ardent advocates of the application of scientific method to the law is with this element of value judgment. They have chosen Bentham's "c ensorial " branch of juris- prudence. And this presents a curious anomaly, because it is just this branch which we conceded at the beginning is not directly approachable by scientific method. But perhaps we must distinguish sharply between so-called "func- tionalism " and the scientific spirit. Perhaps we must agree with Jerome Frank (,7 Corn. L. Q., p. 586) who describes the "functionalists" as "un- flagging idealists disgruntled with the way the courts do itheir work; they are tireless critics of the existing ways." Felix Cohen (loc. cit., p. 829) defines the functional approach as the effort to discover " the significance of the fact through a determination of its implications or consequences in a given... social context ", and admits (p. 849) that such an approach is impossible with- out a "critical theory of values." One wonders if it is not a new, rather than merely a, theory of values which it is sought to apply. To devise and procure the acceptance of a new " critical theory of values" is like introducing a new religion. It may be very necessary; but it is not science, though a science may be of value as its foundation. As Karl N. Llewellyn has said, " It is only in terms of a sound descriptive science of law . . . that ideals move beyond the stage of dreams " (30 Col. L. Rev., pp. 463-464).</page><page sequence="18">No. 4) THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 513 from the classification " crime" and from the classification "bad ", the law is clear; but, if the set of facts fits the defini- tion of "crime " and the particular judgment on the case ex- cepts it from the classification " bad ", then the definition of " crime " must presumptively be wrong. For the chief pur- pose of the definition is to enable accurate prediction-to fore- cast what the value judgment will be. This purpose requires that the criterion of classification include, among its means of identification, the legal consequences which will result from any set of facts so identified. The combination of these two requirements in the criterion for the classification of one set of facts-a uniformly applicable definition and a uniform legal consequence-introduces further complexities. If the value judgments are uniform and so result inevitably in one set of consequences, the classification of the facts according to legal consequences will be perfect; and yet it may be purely em- pirical. Only if the key to the uniformity of the value judg- ment can be given, so that the definition of the class includes it, is the criterion truly analytical.17 In this connection an- other point is worth making, though it is hardly applicable to the particular example of a legal entity that we are using. When the law habitually and deliberately misclassifies a set of facts in order, because of the similarity of its judgments on them, to attach thereto, without analyzing its reasons, cer- tain legal consequences which are regularly accorded to the class in which it is misplaced, we have what is called a legal fiction. That is a trick based on the perception that it is easier to expand old classes (synthesize) than to add new ones (analyze)."8 But the result is to destroy the validity of the definition of class because there is arbitrarily included there- under, albeit as a sub-class, an entity which is not in other respects a part of the same whole. We have, for instance, quasi-contracts and implied contracts, which are not agree- 17Llewellyn calls this "explicit-making" (loc. cit., p. 436, n. 4). On this double criterion see John Dickinson, 79 U. of Pa. L. Rev., pp. 856 et seq. 18 As Llewellyn leniently puts it, in a somewhat different connection, "The job cannot be done unless the new can be made most of the time to pass as being old." Essays on Research in the Social Sciences (Washington, Brookings Institution, 193I), p. 104.</page><page sequence="19">5I4 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV ments at all.'9 Nevertheless, even these additional com- plexities and confusions do not convert the legal entity into an abstraction instead of a class of data. They merely convert the criterion for classification from a simple one, defining a kind of situation from which the legal consequences flow with perfect regularity, to a compound one into which, if the cri- terion is not analytically perfect, the more uncertain element of a specific value judgment on the case may be introduced as a sometimes open drawbridge between the set of facts and the legal consequences.20 An example is also required to represent a legal entity of the most seemingly abstract type. Obviously the name of the legal entity, " a right ", like that of the popular entity, " a wrong ", is a derivative of the foregoing process of value judgment, the distinction between right and wrong. This sug- gests that the noun was derived from the adjective; and so it was. It also suggests that, at first, there must have been an- other noun which this adjective modified and which it only later replaced. If so, it is the original noun which stood for and still stands for the datum. It is as if a " red apple " came to be known merely as a " red ", with the result that scholars lost sight of the apple and came to see " red " as the entity instead of merely one of its attributes. What was and is the entity, " a right "? Let us take, as a simple example, " right of way ". In Roman law the major part of this was originally known as iter, " a going ", the name of a common act; in more sophisticated times that became ius eundi, an " authorized 19 In that kind of classification, the duck-billed platypus is a bird because it has a similar front end. In natural history it is called a paradox, but not a fiction. 20 It seems to me that some such discrimination enters into Roscoe Pound's separation of "human conduct" from "business transactions" and his belief that a high degree of certainty is possible and necessary only for the latter. In the latter, value judgment is (or w.as) less often a factor. See Introduc- tion to thze Philosophy of Law (New Haven, 1922), pp. 139-I43, and Interpre- tations of Legal History (Cambridge, Mass., 1923), pp. 153-155. Perhaps some are interested in obliterating this distinction principally because they are convinced that " economic transactions " are also always good or bad from the social standpoint.</page><page sequence="20">No. 4) THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 5I5 authority of going"; 2" the bridge between these two stages would have been, in English terminology, a " right going"; and the three, steps, in English, would have been a " going ", a " right going ", a " right of going ". In all cases of ante- cedent, or substantive, rights the datum itself will be found to be such an act or relation which existed before, or exists out- side of, the law, and which is some observable feature of the structure or functioning of human societies. Calling it " a right" is merely an ellipsis and does not convert the name of the act into an abstraction. It only expresses the fact that it is among the authorized and approved, or " right ", acts and relations.22 The remedial, procedural and adjectival rights are correspondingly classes of acts at law (actio)-the legal consequences which are potentially attached to these " infra- jural " 2S acts and relations (antecedent rights) when they are right" or as a means of determining whether or not they are right ' Nor is there anything more abstract about these secondary acts, even though they would have no existence in- dependent of law. In fact, as Maine says, " Substantive law has at first the look of being gradually secreted in the interstices of procedure." 24 It was these concrete secondary acts which were first visible within the restricted hori- 21 This unconventional translation of ius is in accordance with my analysis of the Roman usage. See The Institution of Property, pp. 149 et seq., I65-I67, I88-I9I. 22 There is nothing "sub rosa" about it, as Llewellyn seems to think (30 Col. L. Rev., p. 44o). While it is ultimately based on a value judgment which declares the act " right ", it is true, nevertheless, that, at the level of the decision itself, the proximate determination is one of "lawfulness" only. On this see Max Radin, 5i Harv. L. Rev., p. II45. The above statement is merely summary. For exact and detailed analysis of a right we need Hohfeld, as well as Radin's valuable further exploration of Hohfeld's diggings; see par- ticularly Radin, loc. cit., pp. II63-II64. For a general review and criticism of the present state of the analysis of a right, see Pound, 5o Iarv. L. Rev., pp. 571-576. 23To borrow Albert Kocourek's terminology; see his Jural Relations (In- dianapolis, 1927). Llewellyn (30 Col. L. Rev., p. 440) calls them "non-legal rights ". But it is the law which declares them " right ", and therefore rights ", though the act is not " at law ' 24 Dissertations on Early Law and Custom, p. 389.</page><page sequence="21">5 i6 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV zon of law, and it was they which came to shed the radiance of abstract rightness upon the concrete primary acts.25 This brief analysis of some legal " concepts ", so called, in terms of sensible data may also shed some light on that con- fusion worse confounded, the present arena of battle over the nature and significance of legal rules or principles. In terms of our analysis the legal rule is not one of the legal entities at all. It is, instead, a statement of the criterion by which the law classifies its entities. For instance, a will may be required to bear two signatures; if it does not, it is excluded from the legal class " will ". This particular rule is the application of a single criterion only; it is a question of fact rather than of value judgment, and the failure of the expected legal conse- quences results automatically. The question " When is a will not a will?" is easily answered. Where the aforementioned double criterion enters, the rule shows more clearly its double aspect, the combination of identification and of value judg- ment; and that, in turn, introduces the discrepancy between what the law says and what it does, and thereby the uncer- tainty as to what the law is. An analogy may again be useful here. Botany has analyzed the mushrooms into varieties, and has synthesized these many varieties again into a single class of poisonous and a single class of non-poisonous varieties. Now, if we set a thousand botanists to work identifying specimens, they may or may not agree. Some may be ig- norant as to what distinguishing characteristics should be chosen as criteria, or uncertain as to whether the specimens are harmful or not; or they may be unobservant, or merely stupid; there may be honest differences of judgment; some of the specimens may be new varieties or " sports " of the old (and this is the usual condition of legal cases which serve as speci- mens in law schools). Which is the system of criteria, what the textbooks " say " or what the botanists " do "? The only sensible answer seems to be that, at this late stage, what the textbooks " say " usually represents a consensus of informed judgment and thereby expresses acceptance of a system of 25 And the antecedent right then came, through the work of what T. R. Powell calls " the postmortemizer ", to seem at law like a little lump of this abstract rightness because the original noun eluded the legalistic thinker.</page><page sequence="22">No. 4] THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 517 criteria, or definitions, developed out of what botanists have " done" in the past. Therefore what the botanists "do " now is usually identical with what the textbooks " say ". In- dividual botanists who diverge from that standard system are presumptively in error. On the other hand, where there is not consensus and acceptance there is as yet no settled cri- terion, no rule; and a good textbook will state that fact. This analogy may strike the reader as unfair. The classification of mushrooms is a relatively simple matter; the determination of the poisonous effect of, say, the amanita by observation is posi- tive; the value judgment of poison is sure. Like sin, we are unanimously " agin it ". Nevertheless the factors entering into classification and judgment are of the same kind, though different in degree, in the case of law. Legal rules constitute the criteria of the judicial process of classification; they represent, as well as may be, the consensus and acceptance, accumulated over the centuries and still ac- cumulating, with regard to definitions of varieties of sets of facts, including the legal consequences which are attached to them and, if that question enters, judgments as to whether or not they are " wrong 2."26 The system of rules we have may be vague and loose; it may be out of date; it may consist of rules of thumb instead of scientific formulations, with the re- sult that identification is largely a matter of guesswork, value judgments are permitted to be hit or miss, and conformity to rule is largely verbal. Nevertheless it is all that the law has by way of a system of criteria for its classifications. Abandon- ment, as advocated by some, would lead only to greater chaos. It is a Hobson's choice. The application of scientific method seems surely indicated. Even then, the law will never make progress toward a truly analytical system by accepting as its ultimate data the current decisions of all-or nearly all- judges; for, in the absence of such a system, these cannot be consistent even if they aim to be, and therefore tend, with whatever lip service may be rendered to the present inadequate 26 Not mere "generalizations" of the "past behavior of judges ", as Cook calls them (loc. cit., p. 308). The developing system of classifying as well as the explaining of this system by botanists, as it gradually generalizes itself by consensus and acceptance, becomes the selected behavior of certain botanists and thus the system.</page><page sequence="23">5i8 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VoL. LV criteria, to degenerate into mere unrelated expressions of in- dividual opinions upon individual instances. Only when the entire profession takes as its ultimate data the cases themselves -the sets of facts-and analyzes and classifies them thor- oughly, will it be moving toward a rational attachment of legal consequences and, thereby, toward a system of criteria, exact, specific and all-embracing, which can gain consensus and acceptance and thus become pragmatically, if tentatively, true. Only in this way can the essential distinction between right and wrong decisions be maintained and sharpened; only in this way can " the law " be more than a law of probability. To an outsider, it would seem that the law, in regarding its entities as mental concepts, has been standing in its own light. It has come to look upon itself as dealing with its own thoughts, ideas, words; actually it has always dealt with human acts and relations. The legalistic view permits the il- lusion that legal entities are created by law and lawyers, while that is true, at most, only of their legal consequences. It classes these entities with such nearly pure concepts as justice instead of with such derived concepts as man. It confuses value judgments with analyzed percepts. It thus places its entities beyond the reach of the kind of analysis and synthesis, through observation and inference, which can be so fruitfully applied to material we call factual. If the law overcomes this preconception as to the nature of its material and, instead, comes to recognize its data to be acts and relations of men in society, of which some are autonomous or external to the law -" the facts ", so called-while others are imposed or internal -the legal consequences, or " the law ", so called-then its entities will convert themselves into percepts, and names, definitions and classifications of the same, all of which are of the order of the material and its organization in every other field of science. And its rules will convert themselves into statements-in terms of both " the facts" and " the law "- of the criteria by which these entities are classified. Even then the task will turn out to be a double one. For it is necessary not only to adopt this different viewpoint as to the nature of the material, but also to reorganize this material by the above-described process of scientific analysis and</page><page sequence="24">No. 4] THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 519 synthesis. Even if it were treated as a classification of real data and not one of mere concepts, the present organization of legal material would not be satisfactory for scientific pur- poses. The present nomenclature, the definitions and the clas- sifications of law are the accumulated inheritance of tradition. In a sense they are like the above-mentioned classification in zoology-an evolutionary pedigree. That basis has its value as record and explanation. It shows the manner in which the varieties were differentiated in their early stages, as well as the source and connotation of each. But whereas the sets of facts in law have continued to evolve, just as have the varieties in animal life, the system of classification in law resembles what a zoological classification would have been in the eocene; or rather it resembles what such a one would now be if no changes in animal life were recognized which had occurred since the eocene. Legal terminology consists, for the most part, of the names of legal fossils. Legal classi- f1cations and definitions no longer adequately analyze the present-day facts; and frequently they do not explain the criteria for current value judgments. This seems to be the just ground for the complaint of the so-called " conceptual nihilists " and for the current impatience with analytical juris- prudence; this seems to be, at its root, the reason for applying scientific method to the study of law. If we examine, for instance, the existing system for the analysis and classification of property, we perceive at once not only that it is archaic and out of date but that the arrange- ments of the present day cannot be fitted into it at all. Even when property comes to be treated for what it is-not a system of concepts, but one of the systems of organization, or systems of relationships, existing in society 27 it will still be necessary to submit it to a wholly new analysis. The resulting classifi- cations may be multiple (for different purposes) each with its own set of criteria. Property may be viewed from the standpoint of inherence and classed as public or private, as now. But, if it is examined from the standpoint of incidence, it can no longer be classed as real or personal. Something along the line of "property in land" and "property in 27 Cf. the author's The Institution of Property, pp. 4I5-426.</page><page sequence="25">520 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LV goods" must be substituted. And, from the standpoint of the composition of these bipolar relations, it will become ob- vious that a chemical type of analysis, in which interests 28 occupy the place of molecules and their component rights that of atoms, must replace the present disorganization. In the course of such a fresh and observational attack it is quite possible that a science of law may have occasion, like other sciences, to go beyond the area of directly observable acts and relations and to impute the existence of certain en- tities which can only be inferred. It is curious, for instance, that the concept of legal personality, which is a relic of legal animism or anthropomorphism, should have been carried over from the natural person to the corporation in the shape of the persona ficta. For, in regard to property at least, this does not at all explain the way the law behaves. Instead, it is the impersonal corporation which shows in its clearest form the behavior through which one may detect the true inherence of property. It is there discovered to be in some sort of nucleus, which I have elsewhere called a " fund ", and which is neither the persons nor the property (interests, rights) it- self. When once this nucleus is inferred it is found also to be evident in the case of all less collective holdings as well, even including the individual holder; and, in turn, when this becomes apparent, then, so far as property law is concerned, the other aspect of what has been called legal personality converts itself into a system of offices, independent both of person and fund, which are occupied by persons in connection with funds. No one has ever seen a " fund " or an " office ". But, since both are derived from external observation of the behavior of the law (the courts, etc.), they are conceptual models or diagrams, like the graphic formulae of molecules, which conveniently organize and systematize a large number of discrete percepts into hypothetical but very pragmatic entities. The fruits of the scientific attitude and method applied to the law will be greatly increased once the present misappre- hension as to the nature of the material with which law deals is corrected, and once the lack of interest in the method of 28 Using the term in its technical sense. In that sense it is defined in the Restatement of the Law of Property, Sec. 5, as " varying aggregates of rights, privileges, powers and immunities ".</page><page sequence="26">No. 4] THE LAW AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD 521 "descriptive science ", identifying, naming, defining and classifying on a truly analytic basis, is overcome. From this will result a great clarification of " expository " jurisprudence. But it will not do to make light of the real obstacles remain- ing. In the first place there is the inherent difficulty, facing bench, bar and student, of determining what actually are or were the " facts " of the case which is being argued or studied. The " facts" are usually disputed; and their determination must, in the interests of justice, be subject to the rules of evi- dence and, in the interests of order, be expeditious and final. Neither of these limitations on the technique of observation is conducive to scientific exactitude. But at least such analysis will help to clarify the " law " of the case. And difficulties in determining the facts face all scientific procedure. The other real obstacle has already been touched upon. Scientific method can only help, in the ways already indicated, to de- termine what value judgments should be made. But its great value in this regard is not so much to be an aid in determin- ing what value judgments should be as it is to be a sure pre- diction what they will be. The chief function of this method is the uncovering of the keys to the preponderant value judg- ments that are being currently made, and that have been made in the past, so as to permit the inclusion of the keys to these judgments in the criteria of legal classifications and thus to lead in the direction of certainty. The essential for complete certainty-that ideal for law-is that each legal classification of sets of facts should be so exactly defined that those who are informed can determine the place in the system in which every specimen they meet in experience belongs, once they have fully ascertained its essential characteristics, and that each set of facts should have a single, sure and definite set of legal consequences. Though complete attain- ment of this ideal is obviously quite impossible, nevertheless, by the application of scientific method, the law may at least arrive at as much certainty as is possible with any body of liv- ing and evolving subject matter, and the battle between the con- tending ethics may be brought into the open, where it belongs.
