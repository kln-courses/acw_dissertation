But the protean possibilities in the presentation among men upon earth of a physical fact of nature, and the specious semblance of many an ordinary fable to the dramatic events of the physical universe, alike render it difficult to discriminate between anthropomorphic myth and the fanciful lucubrations of poets, philo- sophers and old women. How shall we tell whether we have before us a myth or a tale ? And further , one of the most per- vasive conditions in this kind of literature is this that a myth is started quite legitimately upon physical materials, but, as soon as the first touches of personification set in, the myth descends, as it were, to ordinary citizenship upon earth among men, and is then worked up with other purely human or semi- divine conceptions which happen to be at hand, on stock. Those whose business it is to deal with such matters, namely the priests, or those whose natural inclination attracts them to their contemplation and ex- tension, namely the bards, are free agents, at times distressingly free agents, and they go whither they will and the tracks of their roamings are too frequently obliterated. I am tempted to repeat what I have once said in a different connection namely 'that a species of instinctive judgment or, perhaps better, tact, which is certain to develop in thè investigator with the continuous handling of such materials, will be the safest guide in this mode of criticism'. There can be no question that the older investigators of mytho- logical subjects have been too prone to interpret every feature of every sort of tale as a natural phenomenon anthropomorphically stated. It is equally clear that the blunt a 'primi decision that a certain narrative in a text, so preponderatingly mythical as the Rig- Veda, is nothing and never was anything but a story, a fairy- tale, is subject to suspicion on the very face of it. When this assumes by dint of constant repetition the character and pre- tentiousness of a doctrine, a method, it needs to be watched with even greater care than the opposite proceeding, since it is by its very nature obstructive, pessimistic, and hopeless. Needless to say, no judgment may be rendered in any case without an exhaustive assemblage of all the reports on a given point contained in the documents themselves. The first duty of the Vedic investigator - upon this we cannot insist too often - is to have all the The fifth series was published in the J. A. O. S. XVI. 1 - 42: 1.

The authors of the Yedische Studien are notoriously inclined to the belief that a considerable part of the Rig -Veda consists of fairy-tales, and in that spirit Professor Geldner has recently under- taken the interpretation of the hymn on Mudgala and Mudgalānī, RV. X. 102. I can not spare him a friendly indictment in con- nection with both of the points stated above. He has, it seems to me, been too ready to assume that the hymn in question is merely a fanciful tale, what we should call a capital story, and he has not been careful enough to concentrate all the dicta of the literature, and to subject them to close criticism before entering upon his task as an interpreter. According to Professor Geldner we have in RV. X. 102 the following story: Mudgala, an old gentleman, enters upon a chariot-race, although he is not possessed of a racing- chariot, but has only an ordinary ox -cart. Also, he has only a single steer, though two are necessary. He disguises the cart so as to make it look like a race-chariot and in place of the second ox he yokes a drughaņa , a block of wood, or a wooden ox, which performs the double function of completing the span, and smashing up the competitors. Since Mudgala himself is too old his young and courageous wife, Indrasenā or Mudgalānī, drives, and wins the race *). This fabric of fiction is based upon two reports of the story, of the sort called itihāsa. One is that of Sadgurušisya in his commentary on Katyayana's Sarvānukramaņī, p. 158 2), which reads as follows: 'Mudgala s cattle was stolen by thieves, with the ex- 1) Prof. Geldner, Ved. Stud. I. 138, had previously advanced a con- struction of the hymn which also involved a race, but the word drughaņa was translated by 'hammer'. The passage hútam sma trňhád abhimātim eti is rendered by 'dor Hammer e:lt, das Ilinderniss zerschmetternd'. Prof. Pischel, ibid. p. 124, offered a very different restoration of the legend: Mudgala and Mudgalānī take part in a race, in which buffaloes were yoked to the chariots. The charioteer Kesin who inspired his buffaloes by loud cries was their com- petitor. Mudgala won because one of the animals of their opponent, having drunk too much water, stopped in the middle to relieve himself, and the other fell down. One cannot refrain from calling attention to the extraordinary change of view which has come over these scholars, and to emphasize that, after all, subjective interpretations of materials, plastic on account of their very obscurity, need be advanced with the utmost caution, rather in the manner of light cavalry than that of heavy dragoons who undertake to bear down everything before them. It is of course far from me to reproach these learned and ingenious scholars for an honest change of opinion, be it ever so rapid; I merely desire to characterize the degree of finality which may be claimed by constructions which are not supported by fairly distinct utterances on the part of the texts themselves. Confident assertion is surely out of place in such cases. 2) The same account is quoted by the commentator at Nir. IX. 23 (Bibliotheca Indica) vol. IV, p. 35, foot-note. 3 ft*</page><page sequence="4">544 Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. ception of an old steer. Having yoked this steer to one side of his cart, and the drughaņa to the other, he pursued the thieves leaving the guidance of the cart to the drughaņa , and regained the catti e' Sayana in his commentary varies this by making Mudgala undertake the pursuit with his ox singly. The drughaņa comes in later : Mudgala finds it on the way throws it and regains possession of his herd. Geldner omits the mention of this version of the tale; it will help us later to disprove his translation of the word drughaņa which is incorrect on the face of it. Yaska, Nirukta IX. 23, reports the itihāsa as follows: 'Mudgala, the son of Bhpnyasva took part in a contest (samgrãma) and won the race (pji). Durga on Nirukta (edition of the Bibl. Ind. vol. IV. p. 35) adds the following: 'Engaging in a contest with the king, owing to the absence of a second ox he yoked the drughaņa with the bull, directing him with his divine power, ran a race with the king, and conquered him: sa hila dvitïyagor abhāvāt rājfiā saha pratispardhamānah âiévaryãd anvãdiéya drughaņam vj'sa- bheņa saha yuktvã rājnā sahā "jim sasarpa sa ca tarn jigãya. It is evident that the later treatment of the story, while much diversified, exhibits certain features with sufficient constancy to make them worthy of close attention. Upon this basis Geldner construes the hymn as a glorification of a fabulous chariot-race, and he garnishes the narrative of the event with all the environments of modern sporting life. Turf- men, devoted to women and a loose life, converse in knowing slang full of leering double ententes ; the tricksters of the stable employ every expedient within their power to interfere with legitim- ate success; jocose remarks abound on the lusty but illmated Mudgalānī, and her old and impotent1) husband; all these circum- stances are combined into a decidedly spicy concoction. They do indeed make up a picture of civilization so advanced, as to suggest the enquiry whether there is anything quite as advanced in the classical literature of Sanskrit. Both Profs. Pischel und Geldner, being anxious to accentuate the genuine Hindu character of the earliest Brahmanical scriptures - an effort which has my cordial sympathy - are not a little prone to erase the especial features of the Veda as a distinctively religious collection, to lose sight of the vedatvam of the Veda, as it were. On the other hand they incline also to underestimate the rodent qualities of the tooth of time, when it comes to a matter of a thousand years or so. The spirit of Beowulf and Saxon institutions may crop out here and there in the literary products of the English muse in the nine- teenth century, but the interpreter of the cruces of the ancient Anglo-Saxon documents must needs employ great caution when he 1) So according to Professor Geldner. But it will appear below that this is an unfounded assumption.</page><page sequence="5">Bloomfiéld , Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 545 desires to solve these difficulties by aid of the diction of the Victorian poets *). I for my part cannot help believing that the lively chic modernness which these clever scholars endeavour to impose upon the Mantras of the Veda is at least as far from the truth as the earlier tendency to detect everywhere a primitive hoariness, appropriate to the 'Aryan bible', or the energetic efforts of the late lamented Abel Bergaigne to transplant to heaven the ordinary terrestrial events which crop out incidentally in the songs of the Rishis. In general nothing is so certain to avenge itself in Vedic research as operations undertaken with the aid of a single formula or 'principle'. In the first place, I am disposed to doubt strongly that the hymn has in view any kind of a race at all. There are, to be sure, a number of words which lend themselves readily to such a construction, indicating as they do some kind of contest, but such words are notoriously of double meaning. Thus ají certainly has both meanings of the English 'contest': it is the struggle for a prize, race, but certainly also the clash of arms. We need but remember that Indra alone is designated as āji-krt (VIII. 45. 7), ãji-twr (Val. 5. 6), āji-pati (Val. 6. 6) in order to realize that the words may refer to something more serious than a race or a bet. In our hymn there is one stanza which puts to silence all doubt that serious contest for booty is referred to. Stanza 3 reads: antdr yaciia jighCvasato vájram indrā ' bhidásatah : dãsasya vā maghavann aryasya vã sanutdr yavayã vadhdm. 'Ward off, O Indra, the bolt of the enemy who desires to slay; keep afar the missile of the barbarian or the Ary a'. Geldner translates: 'Halt auf, o Indra, den Keil des Feindes, welcher sie verderben will, etc.', and in his notes he remarks : 'The verse shows that the parties contesting (the race) prepared hindrances of a peculiar sort against one another', 'dass man sich im wahren Sinne des Worts Knüppel zwischen die Beine warf'. Where is there anything of the sort to be found in this verse whose meaning is so manifestly what we have offered above? We cannot fail to notice the word prtanájyesu in st. 9 d (cf. jaghndihur prtanájyesu in VII. 99. 4) , nor the terminology pertaining to a contest, more serious than a race, in stanza 8 cd. I fancy that very few will be found to admit the propriety of Geldner's translation of the last-mentioned passage : nrmņām knivdn bahdve janâya gāh paspaéãnás tavislr adhatta , rendered by 'Er 1) For an interesting instance of a survival, or rather resuscitation, of Anglo- Saxon style and diction in the nineteenth century see the essay of my colleague Prof. H.

I know of no warrant in Vedic usage for such a rendering; I do not see but what we must translate pāda c by 'performing heroic deeds in behalf of many people', not 'before many people'. And the expression gáh paspoáànds tdvisvr adhatta fairly clamors for certain parallels which involve the ordinary myth of Indra and cloud -cattle. Thus I. 33. 10: yújam vdjram vrsàbháé cakra í ndro nir jyótiçã tdmaso gá adhuksat ; Y. 14. 4: dvindad gd apdh svhh ; cf. V. 29. 3.; YHI. 96. 17; IX. 87. 8; X. 103. 6, 7, etc. It seems to me impossible to separate the vrsabhd in this hymn from Indra, as I shall show below from a somewhat different point of view. Here we may ask, at any rate, for some support of Geldner's translation of tdvisvr adhatta by 'er ward hitzig', i. e. 'he became ruttisH'. This seems to me as completely devoid of support as the translation of bahdve jdnãya by 'before many people'. It is clearly disproved by BY. Y. 32. 2, where, of course, it refers to Indra's manifestation of strength. Again, the expression kutam srna trnhdd abhimātim eti in st. 4 is certainly not redolent of the turf. This brings us to another point, the meaning of drughaņa. The translation of this word by 'wooden block', 'machine', 'automaton' is indefensible and deprives the hymn of its most characteristic point. The com- mentators and scholiasts define the word as 'hammer', or 'axe', i. e. ghana for dru 'hewer of wood'. So Amarasiûha, AK. II. 8. 91; the scholiast at Pāņ. III. 3. 82, and Sayana at EY. X. 102. 9. Sayana at AV. YII. 28. 1 explains it as follows: druh drumo hanyate aneneti drughaņah lavitrãdih . In TS. III. 2. 4. 1; Ap. Sr. XI. 5. 2 vighand takes the place of drughaņa and both Sa- yana and Rudradatta regard it as a 'hammer'. Rudradatta in the latter place glosses it by mudgarah tena lostāni ghnantî. Above all the passage Kaus. 46. 2, 3 puts it out of the question to regard drughaņa as a karmadharaya- compound meaning 'a ghaņa made of wood', since it is stated in sutra 3 that the head of the drughaņa which is employed as an amulet to ward off calumny may be either of palâéa- wood, iron, copper, or gold: su. 2. dru- ghanaéiro rajjvā badhnāti. sü. 3. pratirūpam palãéâyolohahira - ņyāņām. Cf. both Dãrila and Keáava. In the fourth stanza of our hymn the word huta is the synonym of drughaná ; kuta has the meaning of 'hammer' in every Yedic passage which is accessible at present, even at AY. VIII. 8. 16 (cf. Ved. Stud. I. 138 - 9) where Geldner renders it by 'trap': imd uptà mrtyupãéá yán ákramya na mucyáse amúsyã hantu sênãyã idám kutam sahasraédh. The temptation to render kuta by 'trap' here is very great owing to the seeming parallelism of the two halves of the stanza, and I myself had this translation in mind in the treatment of the ex- pression ãévatthãni kūtāni in Kāuš. 16. 16, which represents the</page><page sequence="7">Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 547 Atharvan word in the ritual l). But the word hantu is decidedly unfavorable to this construction, and I prefer to rely upon the expression tasya na kūtena praghnanti in SB. III. 8. 1. 15; Āit. Br. VI. 24, rather than the general parallelism. There can be no doubt in my opinion that the name mudgala is identical with the later mudgara 'hammer and that there is present in the mind of the poet a more or less clear knowledge of the inter-relation of drughaņa , kūta and mudgala ; cf. Sadgurusisya's gloss drughaņa = mudgara, ibid., and Sayanas statement in the introduction to the hymn: drughaņo nama mudgarah , taddevatyam idam indra- devatyam vã. The word drughaņa is also the equivalent of dru-ghnl 'axe', Kaus. 14. 13; 25. 17; 26. 3. As far as Yaska's gloss, Nir. IX. 23, is concerned, the Pet. Lex. and Geldner attach undue importance to it. He says dru- ghaņo drumamayo ghanah 2), i. e. 1 drughaņa is a hammer con- sisting of wood'. As may be gathered from Kāus. 46. 3, cited above hammers could be made of wood, as well as other substances, and it is natural enough that one etymologist should allow this fact to determine his analysis erroneously. In the ninth stanza of the hymn the expression kãsthãyã madhye drughaņam éayãnãm is explained by Durga on Nir. IX. 23 as drughaņam éayânam apaviddham , and drughaņam ãjyante . . . apaviddham. Säyana in the introduction to the hymn has the following stanza: drughaņam yuyuje 1 nyatra ca cāuramārgānusārakah drughaņam cāgratah ksiptvā cãurebhyo jagrhe svagāh. The words apaviddham and ksiptvā show that in their opinion the drughaņa was hurled at the enemy. On this supposition the word éayãnam becomes more pointed: the drughaņa fulfils two functions, that of being yoke -fellow of the bull and at the same time the weapon of the combatant. These two items therefore seem to me to be fairly well established; the theme of the hymn is a battle and in the course of it a hammer plays an important and singular rôle. Another point, capable of nearly exact demonstration, is that the word indraskná is not simply the plain name of a Hindu lady, the wife of one Mudgala, and hence called Mudgalānl. The texts 1) Dařila says, unintelligibly: kūtam hhãdãnãm , and my comparison of the word khadã (according to Dārila at Kāus. 38. 7 equal to svabhãvajah gartah ) was undertaken in the belief that the word means something like •pitfall'. Possibly Dārila's corrupt gloss may receive some light from AV. VIII. 8. 3: amún ašvatťha níh érnîhi khúdãmún khadirõjirám. Note the word āšvatthāni in Kāus. 16. 16. 2) Cf. the tīkā at Nāigh. 5. 3 in the edition of the Bibl.

Prof. Geldner, following Sayana und Ludwig, takes the same sort of view in reference to idei : the latter is the personal name of Indra's wife, and is therefore called Indrāni just as ¿ndrasená is called Mudga- lānl. He rejects the current view that the word idei means 'might', that idevpdti means primarily 'lord of might' and that the personal áacl was falsely abstracted from this compound, the ambiguous word pati being falsely construed to mean 'husband'. He goes so far as to assert that whenever there is mention of Sacīs in the plural, as is the case very frequently, even then there is no mention of Indra's 'mights' but simply of Indra's wives. The Sacīs are simply the harem of Indra. The full consequence of such a view is that the pāda : iiksā iaclvas tdva nah šdcíbhis , EV. I. 62. 12, is to be translated: 'help us, o you who posses Sacī (or áacis), with the Sacīs' instead of 'help us, mighty one, with thy mights'. Geldner cites RV. I. 82. 6 to show that there is mention of a wife of Indra ( pdtni ), and III. 60. 6, matsvehd no 'smín sdvane édcyã purustuta, which he doubtless intends to be translated 'drink here at our soma-pressure, o much lauded one, in company with áacť to show that áaci is sufficiently corporeal to take part in Indra's drinking-bouts. The latter passage is by no means conclusive; one misses the word sahd which would clinch matters. A mother of Indra by the name of áavas, an old lady, innocent of all mythological complications, might with equal propriety be derived from EV. IV. 24. 1; VHI. 81. 14, where Indra is designated as i dvasah sünúh and putrdh idvasah 'the son of strength', and it does seem indeed that the Eig-Veda has personified idvas upon this basis into a female Savasl (with obligāto feminine ending) in VIH. 45. 4, 5; 77. 1, 2, just as we have a devi tdvisi in I. 56. 4. I am far from believing that the personification of idei was not dimly felt and hesitatingly ex- pressed in the Eig-Veda, as well as in the later literature, and we may hold ourselves open to conviction case by case. But to assume resolutely that it so in every case is equivalent to dropping the curtain on the history of the conception just at the point when it passes, as we look backward, from idle romancing into signi- ficant and organic mythological history. The virile and universally human element in the entire growth is sacrificed, apparently for no other cause than the one that the primitive organic stage is less easily held fast, analyzed, and described, for the very reason that it is organic and still alive and in a state of growth. Few will be found willing to ignore this very condition in the word iacl in the Eig-Veda. As if intended for the express purpose of illustrating our position in this matter is the history of the word prosali J force'. In TS. n. 4. 12. 1; 5. 2. 1; ŠB. XII. 7. 1. 1; 8. 3. 1 we have the statement: sa (sc. indro) yajftaveiasam hrtvā prāsahā somam</page><page sequence="9">Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 549 apibat 'he (Indra) intruding upon the sacrifice drank the soma by force. Cf. also MS. II. 4. 1; TS. II. 3. 2. 6; VI. 5. 11. 3. Just as Indra is called éáclpdti so also is he designated in RV. X. 74. 6 as prãsáhaspáli. Naturally, the Brāhmaņas operate with a wife of Indra by the name of Prāsahā (cf. for the feminine ending Savasī, above) , and Sayana is to be praised for his abstinence in not introducing this breezily constructed female in his commentary on the passage, as he does uniformly in the case of Sacī. At this point however their construction becomes valuable in the ex- treme, since they identify this personification of Indra's violence, Prāsahā, with a female called Senā who is clearly the equivalent of Indrasenā or MudgalānI, the heroine of RV. X. 102. Further this Prāsahā, or Senā, is by implication identified with Indrāņī, and thus we have, naturally enough, the result that most of the females associated with Indra are personifications of his arms, his force, his violence. In other words, as we shall endeavor to show Indra- senā, or Senā, or MudgalānI, the personified missile *) of Indra, along with their more abstract later personification Prāsahā are separated by no distinct line from Sacī or Indrāņī. In Vāit. Sū. 15. 3; Gop. Br. II. 2. 9; Ap. Sr. XI. 3. 14; Tāit. Ar. III. 9. 1 2), in a list of the wives of the gods, we have the plain statement, sene ' ndrasya patrii. Senā here takes the place of the devapatrii Indrāņī in EY. Y. 46. 8 = AY. VII. 49. 2 = TB. III. 5. 12. 1 (cf. Nir. XII. 46). See also Rig-vidhāna III. 23. 5. In SB. XIV. 5. 1. 6 = Brh. Ar. Up. II. 1. 6, and Kāus. Up. IV. 7 Indra Vāikuņtha and Senā Aparājitā are mentioned together, propagating the same idea: indro vāikuņtho ' parājitā sene 'ti vā aham etam upāsa iti sa ya etam evam upaste jisnwr hā 'parājisņur íhavaty anyatastyajãyl 'I meditate upon him (sc. Brahman) as Indra Vāikuņtha (the impetuous), as Senā Aparājitā (the unconquerable). He who meditates upon him thus becomes victorious, unconquerable, and overcomes his enemies'. This juxta- position is the more interesting, as the same combination is re- 1) Professor Pischel in Vedische Studien, I, p. 231, note 2, asserts that sèna never means 'missile'. In one passage at least, RV. X. 108. 6 the sense of 'missile' seems unavoidable: asenyd vali panayo vácãúsy anisavyús tanvàh santu pãpíh. It seems thoroughly unnatural to translate 'not gifted with armies are your words, O Pañis'; we must translate 'not sharp as missiles (hurtful), O Paņis, are your words', and this justifies the obvious parallelism with anisavyús 'inaccessible to arrows'. The expression sène ' va srstā in I. 66. 7 is to be compared with isum srjata in I. 39. 10, and ásrjanta I sum in AV. I. 13. 4 in further support of this parallelism. So also senãjú in senãjúvâ ráthena RV. I. 116. 1 can mean nothing else than 'with the chariot swift as a missile', sèna and isu seem in fact to be synonymous in the RV. - Cf. now also von Bradke ZDMGr. XL VI, p. 456. 2) Upon this the commentator in TS. IV. 1. 6. 2 (vol. Ill, p. 82 of the Bibl. Ind. edition) bases his gloss: sene ' ndrasya ityâdyanuvãkeno ' ktā devapatnyo janayah.

In the Jāina recension of the same work the same three names occur; see ibid. p. 444.

The text here does not say this, but on the contrary implies that Senā is the daughter of Prajāpati. This may possibly explain the patronymic of Indrasenã, Näräyanl, in Mahābh. III. 10093; IY. 651; Hariv. 6713. Just as the Purusa is called Nãrãyana, asf being descended from Brahman, the prim- ordial man (see e. g. SB. XII. 3. 4. 1 ; Gop. I. 5. 11 ; Manu I. 9. 10), so Senā (Indrasenã) being conceived as the daughter of Prajāpati is designated as Nārāyaņl. For Prajāpati, Ka, is Brahman *). We have here perhaps a variant of the conception that Tvastar forges Indras thunderbolt: RV. I. 52. 7; VI. 17. 10, etc. The missile being Indra' s wife must be the daughter of it fashioner, and the fashioner the father-in-law of Indra 2). The clearest evidence of the identification of Senā, Prāsahā, and Indrāni is contained in a passage of two stanzas in TB. II. 4. 2. 7 - 8 which is repeated with variants in MS. III. 8. 4; IV. 12. 1. The former has: indrāņl devi subhagā supatnl ud aňéena patividye jigâya: trihêad asyã jaghanam yojanãni upãstha indram sthaviram bibharti. senā ha nãma prthivl dhanamjayã viévavyacã aditíh sUryatvak: indrāņl devi prāsahā dadānā sã no devi suhavā éarma yachatu . 'Indrāni, the lovely goddess, who has an excellent husband, was victorious in obtaining a husband by means of her charms. Thirty leagues long is her hind part; in her vulva she holds strong Indra* 3). 'Senā by name, the wealth -winning earth, all-embracing Aditi, having the sun for her covering, the goddess Indrāni giving mightily4), may this goddess who listens to (our) call protect us.' l) Nãrãyana, usually a designation of Visnu, occurs even in the Visņuite Visņu-purāna (Wilson's translation, vol. 5, p. 307) as a name of Brahma. 2) I may add however that this explanation of the epithet Närayanl, as applied to Indrasenã is none too certain. Primarily Nãrãyana in the Mahä- bhārata is Visņu, and the overwhelming Visņuism of that huge compilation may by itself account for the honorific epithet, bestowed perhaps quite gratuitously. I would recall in this connection the fact that UrvašT is Närayanl 'the daughter of Nãrãyana' according to the well-known legend; see, e. g. VikramorvasI (ed. Bollensen) 9 (p. 8); 15 (p. 11). Now Urvašī is spoken of as suJcumāram paharaņam mahendassa (ib. 4, p. 5), and it is not impossible that the epithet Närayanl as applied to Indrasenã is due to a syncretism based upon the idea that both are weapons of Indra. 3) sub hag a in this stanza with double entente ( bhaga = vulva); ansa = bhaga is used in the same sense. 4) It is difficult to say whether prāsahā is here felt in its original value, as is assumed in our translation, or whether we have here the word-created goddess Prāsahā, in the true sense of the word mythos, as she appears in the Àit. Br. III. 22.</page><page sequence="12">552 Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda . In MS. IH. 8. 4 the first of these two stanzas occurs in the following form: indrānl patyä sujitam jigãya ud aňéena patividye bibheda: tnrvhéad yasyâ jaghanam yojanâni upasthā indram sťhaviram bibharti. The second stanza occurs at MS. IY. 12. 1 with several variants, and the first pāda of the first stanza prefixed, as follows: indrānl patyä sujitam jigãya senā ha nama prthivī dhanamjayã viévavyacâ aditih 1) sûryatvak : indrānl prāsahā samjayantl tasyâi ta enā havisā vidhema. The array of evidence which thus binds Indrasenā to Indra is almost startling, and I cannot, therefore, help believing that the hymn X. 102 has a genuine mythological background, the aggressive force of Indra, his missile 2), personified as a female, who then shades off into and blends with other female personnifications of Indra's salient quality, his warlike might. Mantra, Brāhmana, Upa- nisad, and Sutra all unite in treating the conception familiarly, and the tenth book of the RV. is surely not surrounded by a Chinese wall which shuts these out as 'later' . On the other hand the name Mudgalānī binds Indrasenā to Mudgala, in whom we can- not help recognizing Indra's force personified as the male 'hammer', 1) The association of Aditi with Indraņī is note- worthy. It takes place also in the familiar Yajus-formula, adityã rāsnā 'sī ' ndrânyãh samnahanam : MS. I. 1. 2; IV. 1. 2; TS. I. 1. 2; TB. III. 2. 2. 7; VS. (Kāņvašākhā) I. 30; VS. (Mādhyamdina-šākhā) XXXVIII. 3; ŠB. XIV. 2. 1. 8; Āp. Šr. I. 4. 12. Çf. also TS. V. 5. 20. 1; 6. 18. 1; 19. 1; 7. 16. 1; 22. 1; TB. III. 7. 5. 10, and Šānkh. Gr. I. 12. 6, quoted below. The passage, sena ha nama prthivī dhanam- jayã viévavyacâ aditih sûryatvak, seems in fact to contain a clearly expressed identification, first of Indrāni and Aditi; secondly of both with Prthivī, the earth - as for as I know the only plain utterance in the Mantras as to the physical origin of Aditi. If we compare AV. XII. 1. 61 where Aditi is designated as ãvápanl jánãnãm . . . paprathānā with VS. XXIII. 9. 10, bhúmir ãvápanam mahát , the same conclusion results. See also MS. II. 11. 6 (143. 12) and cf. Nāigh. I. 1 ; III. 30, and the Hindu tradition (Hillebrandt, Aditi, p. 39 ff.). The epithets dhanamjayã , viévavyacãh , and sûryatvak are too clear to question; they refer to the earth. Yet, if we consider e. g. AV. VII. 6, Aditi must represent a broader conception like 'universe, space' and her definition as 'earth' must represent a specialization, a narrowing of the term, somewhat as we in modern languages make the terms 'world' and 'earth' synonymous. But by what grievous mixture is Indrāņī-Senā introduced into this company ? The commentary at Gobh. Gr. IV. 4. 33 claims that Indrāni is Indra's mother, not his wife (see Knauer's translation, notes, p. 205). But ordinarily Aditi is the mother, Indrāni the wife. The two are the prominent females in his life, in addition to others of a more sporadic character; cf. Muir OST. V, pp. 7 7 ff. 2) The only doubt is whether senā is not after all to be regarded as 'army' ; the nature of the mythological conception would remain much the same ; in either case there is a female personification of Indra's quality as a warrior.</page><page sequence="13">Bloomfiéld , Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 553 the drughana-hüta-mudgara. This amounts in fact to Indra's vajra 1), and the coupling of the forces senā and vajrd as male and female embodiments of Indra's forces is the rock-bed upon which the legend in X. 102 has grown up. There is yet another tie which connects the scattered utterances which we have assembled and the hymn itself. The expression patividye jig ay a (bibheda) with its descriptive personal adjuncts in TB. II. 4. 2. 7 ; MS. III. 8. 4 aims certainly at the same utter- ance as pativídyam ānat pïpyânâ in RY. X. 102. 11. In Ait. Br. III. 22 Senā is described as Indra's priya vāvātā ; in RY. X. 102. 11 as parivrhtā. The parivrhtā is one of the three or four wives of the kin¿ (TB. I. 7. 3. 3 ff.; III. 9. 4. 5; SB. XIII. 2. 6. 5; 4. 1. 8 : mahisl , vāvātā , parivrhtā , pālāgall) and the parivrhtā is always found next to the vāvātā , e. g. in AY. XX. 128. 10. 11, and in the diatribes of the Asvamedha; cf. Laty. IX. 10. 1 ; SB. Xin. 5. 2ģ 6 ff., and Mahldhara at YS. XXIII. 26 fg. The employment of vāvātā in Āit. Br. III. 22 may be due to the desire to pun on the word vāvāna in RY. X. 74. 6, a stanza which assumes a prom- inent part in the story of Prāsahā-Senā because it contains the expression prāsdhas pàti. Even without this the interchange of two terms so closely contiguous is natural enough. The same con- ception is represented also, in a somewhat veiled fashion, by TB. TTT. 7. 5. 10; Āp. Sr. II. 5. 9: indrāņl 'vā ' vidhavā 2) bhüyäsam aditir iva suputrā (cf. also TB. III. 6. 13. 3), and Sāūkh. Gr. I. 12. 6 : 1) Cf. vajrakūta in Bhag. P.

I. 11, in the course of the wedding-ceremonies occurs a rite designated as indrāņī-karma by the scholiast. Haas, Ind. Stud. V. 293, observes that the scholiast himself was ignorant of the reason for this name, and expresses the belief that the protection of the household was the function of the goddess, and, therefore, the ceremony was named after her. Oldenberg in his notes on the passage, Ind. Stud. XV. 126, remarks that the divinities Indra and Indrāni, the highest heavenly pair were, of course, indispensable in rites preparatory to marriage, but that Indrāni seems not to have played an important part in the ceremony, although it was named after her. Winternitz in his treatise 'Das altindische Hochzeitsrituell nach dem Àpastambïya-Grhyasûtra, p. 31 (Denkschriften der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien, vol. XL) translates indrāņikarma by 'Indrāņīfest', and thus misses the point of the ceremony, it is not a festival. If we compare the words indrāņl 1 vā 1 vidhavā bhüyäsam in TB. III. 7. 5. 10 with sūtra 5: catasro ' stāu vā ' vidhavāh šākapiņāĀbhih surayâ ' nnena ca tarpayitvâ it becomes perfectly obvious that the indrāņikarma is a practice undertaken by both bride and groom to prevent her becoming a widow, that most dreaded of misfortunes which befáis the Hindu family. And both statements are founded ultimately upon RV. X. 86. 11 = AV. XX. 126. 11 = TS. I. 7. 13. 1: nahy asyä (sc. indrãnyâh) aparam cana jarásâ mar ate pátih.

Here Saci is designated as a vāvātā just as Prāsahā-Senā in Āit. Br. III. 22. The reader may now. ask: 'How is it possible that Mudgala and Mudgalānl (Indrasenā) are both personifications of Indra's weapons, and yet Mudgala himself operates in our legend with a drughaņa-kūta-mudgara a 'hammer' ? What sense is there in such a person s appeal to Indra, and is there not a suspicious likeness to Indra himself in the vrsafoha who is joined to the druģhaņa and with him wins the battle? These questions are pertinent, and others of similar import might be added. The answer is that we have not before us a myth pure and simple, but a legend which has grown out of certain mythical conceptions, whose precise character was no longer present to the mind of the narrator, though there was left a blurred consciousness of the nature of the mythical elements which kept the legend on the whole within the limits of the original real properties of the myth. Indra and the vrsabha are after all both Indra; Mudgala, Mudgalānl, and the druģhaņa after all nothing but Indra's weapons ; and finally the enemy. This is the list of the dramatis personae when viewed from the myth- ological point of view. But the hymn of the Rig- Veda never- theless contains a narrative built up with these timbers, and the precise degree to which the personification has been carried is doubtless to be regarded as a somewhat independent chapter in the investigation of the hymn. For this purpose we may well ignore for the present - as Professor Geldner has done altogether - the translucent character of the figures arrayed in the narrative and ask ourselves what it is precisely that is told in these verse - lines. And the answer in the first place is that the diverting itihāsa which Geldner has construed, though it would doubtless have rejoiced the heart of the story-tellers of the type of Soma- deva, is not in the text. After reminding our readers once more that stanza 3, and the expression leutam sma trnhdd abhīmātim eti etc. (cf. above, p. 546), render it quite certain that a battle and not a race is the subject of the poem we next turn our attention to the assumption that the chariot mentioned in st. 1 is not a true chariot, but an ord- inary cart, fitted up with cunning dëvice to resemble a chariot. Prof. Geldner thinks that the first stanza is spoken by Mudgala to Mudgalānī as she starts out upon the race. But it seems to me that an unprejudiced reader of the opening stanza will rather incline to a more general construction; the tale of Mudgala and Mudgalānl being a warlike one the hymn was doubtless employed in connection with some warlike, performances, and the opening</page><page sequence="15">Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda . 555 stanza is an invocation of the most general sort directed to Indra, the god of war, to aid the chariot of the warrior, the rājā , who was entering upon war : 'May Indra bravely help your . . . chariot. In this battle do you, who are called by many, aid us to the enjoyment of booty'. I have deferred the translation of the word mithūki-tam because it needs to be discussed by itself. Professor Geldner is unquestionably right in posititing (as does Böhtlingk in the smaller lexicon) a stem mithūkft for the word not mithūkfta as the larger lexicon has it. But in order to found his theory he translates the word by 'täuschend'. In the foot-note on p. 6 he remarks that the dual mithu- dréã attributed in RV. II. 31. 5 to usásãnáktã is not quite clear, and suggests that the word may mean 'leering* being used 'to in- dicate the well-known side -glances of bawds and amorous maidens'. But RV. I. 29. 3, ní svãpayã mithudréã (Say. yamadutyãu) sastám ábudhyamãne 'put to sleep the two (female messengers of Yama) who are visible by turns (or who look by turns); let them sleep without waking* shows clearly what is meant by mithudréã usā- sāndktā. In the third series of these studies, J. A. O. S. XY. 171, note, I have shown that the former passage refers to sun and moon (here perhaps, secondarily, day and night) which are regarded in the Veda as the two dogs of Yama. The dual usásãnáktã is palpably but another variant of the same idea, and miťhudfé means everywhere 'looking alternately', i. e. 'visible by turns'. In RV. X. 127. 3 we have a statement which reads like a commentary upon mithudréã, namely: nir u svdsãram askrto ' sdsam devy ãyatl 'the goddess (night), having come on, has driven her sister Usas out'. The adverb mithū in mithūkft in the same way ex- presses the idea of 'change', not, however, in the sense of 'disguising', but rather in the sense of 'upsetting, disturbing, injuring, destroying'. The word mithūkft as epithet of rdtha means 'destructive' ; cf. rdťho . . . tvesdh samaisu in RV. I. 66. 6. Just as mithūcar *) in MS. III. 16.' 5* (190. 16) = mithué car in TS. IV. 7. 15. 2 = mithuyã car in AV. IV. 29. 7 means 'to go wrong', 'to sin' 2), so mithū kr means 'to do wrong', 'to injure' in RV. I. 162. 20, a stanza which is addressed to the horse at the Asvamedha: má te grdhnúr aviéastá ' tiháya chidrá gátrãny asínã mithū kah. This passage has not, it seems to me, as yet been placed into the right angle of vision. Ludwig (903) translates: 'nicht soll ein begieriger, ungeschickter zerleger verfehlend die glieder unrichtig mit dem messer zerhauen'. The words 'unrichtig zerhauen' render 1) This reading seems to me preferable to that accepted in the text, mithucar , since the padapātha has mathūcarantam iti mathü carantami}.). 2) mithur bhu in TB. 3. 7. 5. 12; Ap. Sr. II. 19. 6 means 'to be wrong': mame 'dam istam na mithur bhavāti.</page><page sequence="16">556 Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. mithū kah , and Grassmann's 'auf verkehrte art spalten is of the .same import. But the same combination of _ verb and adverb (hriyate mithu) occurs in another connection, Āp. _ ár. HI. 12. 1 ; TB. III. 7. 11. 5 where this meaning is totally inapplicable. The meaning 'do wrong', 'injure', 'damage', 'destroy' suits both of these cases. Every Hindu sacrifice of cattle is overlaid with the fiction that the proper execution of the animal can be performed without injury to it, and even with its consent. In stanza 18 of the same hymn (I. 162) the demand is made outright that the limbs of the animal shall not be cut: dchidrā gátrã vayúnã krņota. Hence the euphemisms èamitar 'he who makes quiet' for 'butcher', savn- jnapayati 'to make resigned (to its fate)', 'to obtain consent' for 'to kill' *), and the like. Hence the very common formula at the paéubandha , and kindred performances : svadhite māi ' nam hvhsih '0 axe do not hurt him (the animal) 2). The expression ma te .. . gátrãny asina rnithü hah 'may he not injure your limbs with the knife' seems to me closely related with this. A greedy unskilled butcher might violate the etiquette established at the sacrifice and offend the 'consenting' animal 3). Even more certain proof of the essential correctness of this conclusion is afforded by the expression má devūnām mithuyá karma bhāgdm in AY. IY. 39. 9 = TS. I. 3. 7. 2, where mithuyá kar is the equivalent of mithū kar just as mithUya car is of mithü car , above. The closest parallel to this expression is to be found at MS. I. 2. 7 (16. 11): má devánãm yüyupäma bhãgadhéyam 'let us not efface (or destroy) the share of the gods ; cf. the fourth series of these 'Contributions', American Journal of Philology XII, p. 424. Still another variant of the expression occurs in Âáv. Šr. Yin. 14. 4: mā devānām momuhad bhãgadhéyam 'may he not confuse the share of the gods'. This must not be taken as an absolute equivalent of mithū kar , since both muh and mithu occur together in BY. YI. 18. 8: sd y ó nd muhé nd mithū j dno bhút. Ludwig translates it (542): 'der nicht zur enttäuschung und nicht umsonst war', which is approximately correct. But here again the true parallel of the passage mithū jdno bhut seems to call in the root yup ; the expression janayópana (sc. mrgah) in BY. X. 86. 22 seems to express the same idea (cf. 'Contributions', ibid. p. 423) and I would therefore translate 'he who is not to be confused, and 1) Cf. Roth in the introduction to the Nirukta, p. XXXIX, and Pet.

I, nr. 2, p. 262.</page><page sequence="17">Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 557 not to be injured'. Or the expression ná mithü jdrto bhüt means 'the person who is not wrong, who does not fair, if we compare in preference a passage like Āp. Sr. II. 19. 6, mame 1 dam istam na rnithur bhavāti 'may this sacrifice not be wrong'. If we scan all these passages the impression is strengthened that the rdtha mithukrl in the opening stanza of X. 102 is a designation of the destructive war-chariot and not 'a fictitious chariot', 'ein aufgeputzter Lastkarren . Prof. Geldner is so firmly convinced of this feature as to fancy both the drughaņa and the chariot to have been artificially made up to resemble other things than what they really are. Thus he emphasizes unduly the fact that the cart is called anas in st. 6. The anas is in his view a sakata but not a real ratha, as we have just seen. This conception recurs persistently in his commentary ; see the notes on la, 6 a, 7 a in addition to the more systematic remarks in the introduction, p. 4. But, if we consider the first stanza as an introductory invocation to Indra to bestow victory upon a king, the occurrence there of the word ratha by no means indicates a close connection with anas in st. 6, and we may ask at once what other word but anas is to be expected in the story where a bull and not a horse draws the wagon. The words msabha and anas are precisely as congenial as aéva and ratha , and that is all there is to be said about it: Mudgalānī in the story drives a bull in front of a cart. To have driven a ratha behind a bull, that would have been singular, not the act depicted by the text. Similarly, the notion that* the drughaņa is a wooden horse leads to a misconception of the word nispad in st. 6, Professor Geldner thinks that Mudgala fitted up this Trojan beast with mane and tail, in order to strengthen the delusion that he was racing with the orthodox pair instead of with a single bull, and that the swift course of the team caused the hair to fall off and flaunt itself into the ' face^ of ; Mudgalānī (see p. 11). But does nispad mean 'hair' ? See Ap. Sr. XV. 3. 17, vrsņo aévasya nispad asi ', where nispad is obviously the equivalent of' vj'sņo 'évasya éalqt in the sūtra. And it does not seem at all certain that this part- icular stanza mentions the dinghaņa at all : kakdrdave is a áíi. ì&gt;ey. and may possibly refer to the cart itself *). The interpretation 1) See now, however, the interesting suggestion of Prof, von Bradke, Z DM6. XLVI, pp. 452, 45 9. He would read kapardavé , and make it equal to kapardine , in st. 8. The suggestion is fascinating; it may not be necessary to change the text, since the interchange between k and p is not unknown else- where, e. g. in nicuūkuņa in MS. I. 3. 39 (45. 11) = nicumpuņa in Man. ér. II. 5. 4 (also Kap. S.; see von Schroeder's note); cf. the two words in the Pet Lex. In Gobh.

Having in mind his wooden horse, he arrives in due course at the value 'stiff ' for this adjective. But an un- prejudiced look at the perfect parallel in RY. YI. 36. 2 : syUma- gjbhe dúdhayé Wvate , and a consideration of the traditional trans- lations of dúdhi, dudhrd , and dúdhita (see p. 9) point irresistibly to a secondary reduplicated stem dudh from dhū , similar in every respect to dad from dā and dadh from dhā. Just as RY. Y. 56. 3 speaks of a dudhró gâúr iva bhlmãyúh *) so the bull in stanza 6 c is said to be 'the impetuous one who having been yoked runs with the cart2). His nispádah 'excrements' might fly even as far as the charioteer owing to the swiftness of his course. We conclude therefore that the cart is an undisguised simple ox-cart, being the vehicle which a bull might naturally draw, just as the drughaņa was a simple axe or hammer. Another feature which Prof. Geldner introduces into the story, and from which he derives serious consequences in his reconstruction of the tale, is the alleged old age of Mudgala. The only statement The relation of the root sap with sac has also been frequently suggested, e. g. Ascoli, Vorlesungen, p. 65, note. In éibha: ¿ighra 'swift', if they are indeed etymologically related, the interchange between bh and gh is due to the fading out of the pronounciation of the aspirates, which makes the substitution of one for the other an undetermined attempt at rendering a sound equal to or ap- proaching h. The root sabh in prasabham 'violent' owes its origin to a similar confusion in the pronounciation of the aspirates: grah: grabh - sah : X, i. e. sabh. Cf. TS. II. 3. 10. 1: y ad adhwyata tad ghrtam abhavat for the similarity of dh and gh . 1) Note the parallelism with RV. X. 103. 1 : ãJúh éíéãno vrsabhô ná bJñmáh. where ãéúh and siéãnah take the place of dúdhi. 2) That there is no independent root dudh may be seen with especial clearness in the tentative participle dódhat (not dódhant ) which occurs not infrequently in RV. and AV. The absence of the n in the stem proves that it was felt to be a participle from a reduplicated stem. Prof. Geldner's exegesis of thé • passages in which this form occurs seems to me anything but con- vincing. The expression votã dódhatah in RV. X. 119. 2 means 'impetuous winds', . $uid the German expression 'steifer Wind', English 'stiff wind' represents a special figure of speech, nautical in origin, I believe, which depicts one phase of. the wind's action, but proves nothing for attributes of the wind in general. ■Ití'RV. I. 80. 5; VIII. -6. 6 the expression vrtrásya dódhatah is obviously the equivalent of vrtrásya évasdthãd in VIII. 96. 7 ; cfģ tvám (sc. indra ) makhdsya dódhatah éíró Va tvacó bharah in X. 171. 2. And in RV. II. 21. 4 dódhato is supposed , by oui: author (p. 10) to mean 'the weapon of the stingy', because. of dsunvato vadh&amp;ly in L 101. 4; VIII. 62. 12. But is this a verbal parallel?, ásunvato vadháh means simply the weapon of the impious, of those who are not Somic o? Brahmanical, i. e. of the enemy. From another point of view these same people may be designated as rushing impetupusly against the Brahmans and their, gods (Indra). Hence éátrwn dódhatah in AV. III. 6. 2. The cloven foot of Prof. Geldner's misinterpretation of the word drughaņa is especially evident in his discussion of the words based upon this secondary stem dudh, dodh. Cf.

IV. 651 : nār ayant ce ' ndrasenā rūpeņa yadi te srutā patim anvacarad vrddhaņi pura varsasahasrmam. On p. 1 our author expresses the belief that the last two stanzas of the hymn, 11 and 12, are quite unintelligible without this personal quality of Mudgala's. In the hymn no word for 'old' occurs; it is noticeable that the slokas of the itihāsas do contain the word jarat , not, however, as an attribute of Mudgala, but of the vrsabha ; see Sadgurusisya p. 158; Sayana in the indro- duction; Brhaddevatā, as cited by the commentator at Nir. IX. 23 (Bibl. Ind. vol. IV, p. 35, foot-note). The existence of this word in the later tradition is rather striking at first sight, but only at first sight. Its occurrence in the itihāsa is a natural outgrowth of the form of the story as there narrated. Mudgala is left with a single bull; in order to enhance his acchievement in the pursuit of the thieves or in the contest the bull is turned into an old bull: his performance thus becomes more striking. Certainly the impression made by the bull in the hymn is that of a lusty animal rather than an old one ; cf. the expressions musJcabhārah and tavislr adhatta in sts. 4 and 8, both of which are part of the phraseology customary in the Indra-myths. I do not believe that there is any better reason for relying upon the authenticity of the word varsa- sahctsrin in the Mahābhārata. Mudgala and his wife are cited there as model couples along with Cyavana and Sukanya, Rāma and Sita, Agastya and Lopamudrā, Dyumatsena and Sāvitrl, all heroic personages. Mudgala, Cyavana, and Agastya are sages of remote antiquity, and Cyavana, especially, is notorious for his old age; cf. SB. IV. 1. 5. 1 - 15. The transfer of his old age to Mudgala is obviously very easy. In the later literature the free manipulation of qualities, and, for that matter, entire lines of narration from one mythical personage to another is too well known to need any special exposition. Professor Geldner supposes now that stanza 11 contains the cynical witticisms of those bad sportsmen who are present at the race; they cannot refrain from commiserating the fair, courageous Mudgalānī, the heroine of the event, for having to be content with old impotent Mudgala, and, as is natural under such exceedingly suggestive circumstances, they do not refrain from alluding to their own uncommonly superior facilities, in case they should be put to the test. It is not altogether easy to reproduce in English the full intent of Geldner's translation: 'She has obtained a marital life like one who is slighted, she, voluptuous, has obtained one who sprinkles with a wretched pump (i. e. sexual organ). We should like to be victorious with the impetuous one as a rider (i. e. 'we should like to try a ride with her, in the most pregnant sense); the game would then yield rewardful happiness'. I have indicated previously my belief that the interpretation of this stanza must not be separated from certain stanzas of the MS. and TB., 37*</page><page sequence="20">560 Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda . and the more incidental allusions to a vāvātā of Indra, designated variously as Senā or Prāsahā, and Indrāni or Sacï; see above p. 551 ff. It does not seem possible to doubt that the statement MS. III. 8. 4 : indrāņī patyã sujitam jigäya ud aňsena patividye bibheda *) or TB. II. 4. 2. 7: indrāņī devi subhagā supatni ud aňéena patividye jigäya are of the same sphere of conceptions as stanza 11 of RV. X. 102. Furthermore, looked at by itself, it is not at all likely that the narrative of this exploit in which Mudgalāni plays so prominent a part should end in a sarcastic account of her discomfiture. If we may permit ourselves at all to draw upon the accumulations of our experience in the literature, we should in the light of all that ex- perience protest that such a view is not Vedic. On the contrary, it seems to me that the entire stanza breathes the spirit of grati- fication: Mudgalāni has obtained a reward altogether in proportion to her merit. Prof. Geldner (p. 14) assumes that the words kuca- Icreņe 'va siñcan stand for kúcakrene ì va sincantam and refer to Mudgala who 'sprinkles with a poor pump 2). But sinedri may be the equivalent of sincanti , and kucakrena is a an. key. The Pet. Lex. translates it: wohl 'die weibliche brusť; Ludwig (974): 'sie die strotzend wie aus einem kruge milch goss' ; Böhtlingk in the smaller lexicon compares the word with kūpacakra 'pump- wheel'. I think it quite possible that the word is derived by some secondary etymologizing process from something else ; possibly Böhtlingk's suggestion will be sustained 3). But I am for my part convinced that the entire pāda expresses approval of Mudgalānī's femininity in the spirit of the passage : indrāņī devi subhagā supatni in TB. IL 4. 2. 7. I do not venture to decide finally whether parivrktâ is used here without disparagement merely as one of the designations of royal wife -hood, or whether it expresses the idea that her lower marital condition4) was obliterated by her signal acchievement. I incline however to the former view; in RV. VII. 18. 2 we have thé unequivocal statement that kings had several 1) Cf. perhaps with bibheda the word añhubhedi in AV. XX. 136. 1; VS. XXIII. 28 (cf.

Such a view relieves the word iva of every strain. In any case there is a connection between pariviktā here and vāvātā in the passages of the Yajus-texts, and the general sense of the stanza must be that Mudgalānī was rewarded for her performance. For the same reason it is quite incredible that the last stanza expresses the veiled prayer of Mudgala that he, a vddhri , may yet be rendered capable. Prof. Geldner's translation on p. 6, and his comment on p. 16, are fraught with an intense suggestiveness, so surcharged as to render the transfer into English exceedingly dif- ficult. The point is that Indra who can win with one steer , stim- ulating him with a eunuch (the drughaņa) as a companion, is sim- ilarly capable of causing victory to perch upon the banner of the sexual warriors Mudgala and Mudgalānī, the former being symbol- ically the impotent wooden machine {drughaņa) of the story, and the latter the fiery vrsabha. I do not understand why Ludwig, Grassmann, Bergaigne (II. 281, note 6), and Geldner construe vrsaņā as an instrumental singular from visan without a word of comment, as though such a form were of the commonest 2). The form vrsaņā, (unaccented vrsaņā) is of very frequent occurrence in the RV. and AY., and I have taken the trouble to verify Grassmann's classification of the forms : there is not one which can lay the slightest claim to consideration as an oblique case :i). The form is always a dual, and Sayana, thus impressed, translates chiastically : vadhriņā pāsena yvjä yujäu yuktäu vrsaņā vrsaņāu varsakāv aévãu rathe yojayitvã codayan éatrusu pr er ay an sisāsasi ājim sambhaktum ich an. In- asmuch as I do not believe that the drughaņa is a wooden horse, but a hammer, the application of the epithet vddhri 'eunuch' to the drughaņa is most problematic 4), and I confess that I do not quite trust myself to translate the second half of the last 1) Cf. alsoRV. I. 62. 11; 71. 1; 105. 8; VII. 26. 3: TS. VI. 5. 1. 4 (eko lahvīr jaya vindate ). 2) So also von Bradke, ibid. 453, 465 who does not fail to take note of the irregularity. 3) To be sure, substitutions of the strong stem for the weak occur in the case of the accusative plural and the genitive singular. In RV. IV. 2. 2 vrsaņah is acc. plur.; in AV. XI. 2. 22 it is gen. sing. (Sayana: secana- samarthasya ); so also in RV. IV. 41. 6 - X. 92. 7. So also possibly in RV. I. 165. 1, ( marútah ) ár canti šusmam vrsaņah (sc. indrasya ) vasīiyā&gt; which seems inseparable from III. 32. 3, yé te súsmam yé távisim ávardhann árcanta indra maridas ta ójali (cf. also II. 17. 1). If we translate vfsaiiah in I. 165. 1 as nom. plur., referring to the Maruts, arcanti súsmam (note the active (!)) hangs in mid-air, and there is in fact no sense in the Maruts praising their own fire, even if the text permitted any such rendering. 4) Neither do I see any reason for admitting that words ddru in st. 8 refers to the drughaņa ; it refers to some part of the wagon. So Sayana: varatrãyãm vadhryãm dāru hāstham rathāmgabhūtam ãnahyamãnah .</page><page sequence="22">562 Blooftifield , Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda . ' stanza l). The assumption that Mudgala is a vddkri is also in open discord with 5 c d : èatávat sahdsram gdvūm múdgalah pradhdne jtíjãya , and there is nothing in the hymn to show, as Prof. Geldner implies, that Mudgala did not participate in the battle along with Mudgalānī. In fact the words rathi in st. 2, and especially sárathi in st. 6 (if indeed the words sdrathir . . . keéî refer to Mudgalānī) imply the presence of Mudgala on the cart and in the contest, and there needs be no stigma upon his manhood for having accepted on a pinch the aid of his wife. The «fe'Aāsa-versions, certainly, do not deny him a place in the little drama. Frankly, I do not see that Prof. Geldner s exceedingly clever construction is anything but a figment of his imagination. And with equal frankness I confess that I have not succeeded in re- constructing either the exact situation from which these lines have sprung, or their meaning stanza by stanza. The mise- en- scène is wanting ; the itihāsas are meagre and discordant 2). The hymn abounds in an. iey. and difficult words, and the tendency in dealing with these is notoriously to press them into the service of preconceived notions. A few points however have established themselves pretty firmly in my mind and these I may now state in connection. Stanzas 1, 3, and 12 are composed in brhatï-metre, the rest of the hymn being in trisļubh. These verses are not spoken by Mudgala as Prof. Geldner assumes, nor, in my opinion, by any personage of the story but by some outsider, perhaps a purohita , 1) The passage in question, vfsã yád ãjim vfsanã sisāsasi codayan vádhrinã yujd , seems to me inseparable from the second half of st. 4, prá muskábhãrah éráva ichámãno ] 'jirám bãhú abharat sisāsan ; the words ivrsanā in 12 c and bãhú may be parallel, and bãhú does not, in my opinion here mean 'fore-feeť, as all translators assume, but 'the two arms (of Indra)'. See Ap. Šr. I. 4. 15, indrasya tvã bãhubhyãm udyache , and especially AV. XIX. 13. 1: indrasya bãhú sťhavirau vrsāņāu (so the text; vfsaņāu in the index verborum). This stanza stands at the head of a hymn which is essentially identical with RV. X. 103, and AV. XIX. 13. 2. 3 = RV. X. 103. 1. 2 also show noteworthy points of contact with our hymn (cf. especially vrsabhó . . . samkrándanah with ny àkrandayan . . . vrsabhám in 102. 5). The impression grows under all this testimony that the vrsabhá in the last resort is Indra, that the bãhú are Indra's arms; cf. also ãéúli éiéãno vrsabhó . . . bhimáh in 103. 2 which may well remind us of the dúdher . . . drávat ah (sc. vrsabhásya) in 102. 6, and even ghanãghanáh seems to express the quality inherent in the drughaņa. The inter-relation of these stanzas in some sense or other seems to me unquestionable. 2) We ought not to omit in this connection to report the entire treatment of the BrhatdevatS, VIII. 11. 12, which, though very obscure, contains one or two suggestive points: pre HI Hihāsasūhtam tu manyate éakatâyanali : yãslcendrâu ghanam ãindram vã vāisvadevam tu šāunakah. ãjãv anena biiãrmyam ca indrãsomãu tu mudgalah : ajayad vrsabham yuTctvã ãindram ca drughaņam rathe . Note that the drughaņa is designated as ãindra , and that Sāunaka in distinction from Sâkatâyana regards the hymn as mythological rather than narrative.</page><page sequence="23">Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 563 who has in charge the management of war for some king. The hymn is essentially a war-hymn, and the priest employs in part an invocation of Indra, whose name occurs in all three of the brhatï-stanzas, and in part of the account of Mudgala's performances. The exact viniyoga of the hymn I have not at hand *) nor is there any connected account of the occurrence which will pass muster. The person who figures in the hymn most prominently, Indra- senā, is clearly a personification of Indra' s weapon, or army. Note the oxytone accent which marks the word as a tatpurusa: the sèna of Indra2). The veiled statements about her in the hymn connect her clearly with &amp; group of equally incidental statements in regard to Indrāni or Saci, and no solution is possible which does not take these into account. The entire set of dramatis personae in the poem savor of the Indra-myth. Indrasenā (Mudgalānī) is the female of Mudgala, and the latter must therefore represent Indra's weapon personified as a male. The natural etymology of the name rnúdgala = mud- gara 'hammer is supported by the drughand which plays an im- portant part by the side of the bull, vrsabhd , and the latter is again obviously Indra in transparent disguise. The second half of stanza 8 is to my mind clearly derived from the cycle of con- ceptions which make Indra liberate the waters from the clouds. No interpretation of the hymn can claim any final hearing which does not point out the manner in which all these more or less faint reverberations from this inexhaustible theme have been blended into a story, although, of course, we need not demand of every detail that it shall stand forth in its pristine naturalistic qualities in a composition which is on the face of it an ãkhyãna . So far I agree with Professor Geldner. Mudgala as well as Mudgalānī are represented in heroic aspects; there is no disparagement of the former, nor pitying innuendo as regards the latter. The drughand , although it seems to appear indeed in the unusual function of yoke -fellow of the vrsabhd in sts. 9 and 10, performs also the natural function of a weapon; hence the words kásthãyã mddhye drughaņdm édyãnam in st. 9, which depict its condition after the battle. We may safely assert that this hymn will figure in the final irresolvable remnant of the Veda, unless a new accession of materials should enrich our present apparatus for its reconstruction. Some time after these pages were ready foç the press there appeared from the pen of Professor von Bradke another essay, 1) Sayana in the introduction: gato viniyogah (where?). 2) So also Sayana at st. 2: zndrasya sena, and sene rídrasya in the passages quoted above (p. 549).</page><page sequence="24">564 Bloomfield , Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda . devoted to the elucidation of RV. X. 102, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, vol. XL VI, pp. 445 if. It is entitled 'A jolly race in ancient India', and the author's view of its purport may be given in his own introductory words : 'The song, RV. X, 102, about Mr. and Mrs. Mudgala, their peculiar wagon with the steer in front is a diatribe, that is, a personal satire on the heroine and the hero of the mock-heroic hymn, their equipage, their span, their lucky and unlucky escapades'. The essay consists of an introduction, a translation, and extended notes, and it need hardly to be stated that a pains-taking treatment of a Yedic hymn from the pen of this scholar is certain to yield some valuable results. A few of these I have utilized in a number of foot-notes above. But I cannot, for my part, place any trust in his construction any more than in that proposed by Prof. Geldner. Prof, von Bradke's analysis does not profess to give a hearing to any allusions to the hymn in the later literature ; his treatment is entirely from within. This leads him not only to ignore the relation of Senā to Indrasenā, but he sets aside the explicit statement of the epic literature that Indrasenā was the wife of Mudgala, in other words that Indrasenā and Mudgalānī are identical; he translates indrasenā by 'Indras Waffe'. He does not fail to note from time to time that the stanzas of the hymn are honeycombed with the language of the Indra myths, but he explains this -(p. 450) by assuming that the author is as it were the slave of mythological forms, and that, in fact, his poetic power (his standing as a poet?) is manifest in the way in which he adheres to this form - 'sein Können zeigt sich darin, wie er sich in dieser Hülle bewegt'. Thus he does not fail to note that the expressions hraddm apibaj jdrhrsāņah in st. 4, and gáh paspaáõndh in st. 8, might be quoted as extracts from an Indra-hymn (see pp. 458, 462), but this is due, if I understand the author aright, either to the poets incontrolable lapse into this kind of diction, or it is due to conscious mock-heroic exploiting of the language of the Indra-hymns. In either case, however, the phrase bahave jdnaya in st. 8 falls flat. The author suggests in his note p. 462 that bahave jdnaya may refer to 'Mudgala's ad- herents among the spectators', but nrmnāni hrņvdn bahave jdnaya can mean but one thing, 'performing valorous deeds in behalf of many people'. And where is there any mention of Mudgala's ad- herents before whom he is making a display? And again we may ask, what is the justification of st. 3 in any kind of a race; this in Prof. v. Bradke's translation means : 'Halt, Indra, ab den Donner- keil des Mannes, der uns nachstellt und uns morden will ; lass fern uns sein, o Maghavan, die Waffe seis des Dāsa seis des Ariers'. Cf. on the three brhatī- stanzas our remark above, p. 562 ff. It would, too, be passing strange to find that the sage Mudgala, AY. IV. 29. 6, Kāth. S. (cf. Ind. Stud. m. 460), Mahābh. III. 15441 ff, in whose honor an Upanisad is named, owes his origin to the country -clown</page><page sequence="25">Bloomfield , Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 565 or 'Bauern -Edelmann* who together with his wife steps in 'where angels fear to tread' and in a foolishly dazed way surprises him- self and everybody else by winning the race, handicapped though he is by every imaginable obstacle. Nothing is more difficult and at the same time more important than the elimination of foreign 'folk-psychology' from the interpretation of the ancient Hindu documents; the wholesale importation of impressions derived from modern European life needs to be hedged in with especial pre- cautions. I do not find it possible at all to believe that any such are applicable to the mixed myth and story of which RV. X. 102 presents tantalizing snatches. 2. On the meanings of the word susma. The traditional interpretations of this word are not much diversified. In the Nighaņtavas (Yäska II. 9 ; Kãutsavaya 53), the word occurs among the balanāmūni ; and in Nirukta II. 24 Yäska explains susmebhih by éosanâih êusmam iti balanāma ¿osayajï 1 ti (cf. also Nil*. X. 10). The commentator on the Nighaņtavas II. 9 in the edition of the Bibliotheca Indica quotes various etymologies ; one is éusyaty anenā 9rih ; another is derived from some commentary of Mādhava : éusih prlņanārihah , iti mādhavah , priyam hi balam. Skandasvāmin is cited as the authority for another still more helpless one: parasparasãmyogiham api balam viéesayati upa- meyati. Very common in the commentaries of the RV., AV., and the Yajus-samhitãs is the explanation éosalcam balam , which re- presents a combination of the explanation of the Nighaņtu with an independent etymology. Indeed, the entire tradition rests upon this balam of the Nighaņtu, furbished up with etymological analyses of the element sus. The modern exegetes very generally base the word on the root seas 'breathe, blow', and the prevailing derivations gained from this meaning are 'blowing, strong, strength' and the like. So the Pet. Lex., Grassmann, and Max Müller in the Vedic Hymns (S.B.E. XXXII), introduction, p. XIII. Ludwig, on the other hand, lends countenance to no etymology; he follows very rigidly the Nighaņtu, and translates susma by 'krafť. That such a meaning suits excellently a very considerable number of the connections in which the word occurs can not be denied. But does it suit all, and is it indeed the meaning which may be placed at the head of the semasiological development of the word? It seems to me that this question must be answered with an emphatic negative. Once before, in connection with my discussion of AV. I. 12. 3 in 'Seven Hymns of the Atharva-Veda', American Journal of Philo- logy VII, pp. 469 ff. (p. 4 if. of the reprint), I encountered the word éúsma' and it is the suggestion of the passage in question which now leads me to a more special inquiry regarding its meaning</page><page sequence="26">566 Bloomfieldy Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda . in general. The passage referred to is part of a hymn addressed to lightning: yó abkrajá vãtajá ydé ca éúsmo vánaspatín sacatām pdrvatãné ca. The translation there offered is : 'may he who is born of the cloud, and born of the wind '), the whizzing (lightning), strike the trees and the mountains'. Aside from the propriety of the word 'whizzing', based as it was upon the commonly accepted etymology of the word from the root évas , the connection of the word with lightning is self-evident. Clearly, now, the word éúsma means lightning also at AY. IX. 1. 10 and 20: stanayitnús te vák prajāņate vfsā éúsmam hsipasi bhümyäm ádhi. The passage can scarcely be misunderstood: 'The thunder, O Pra- jāpati, is your voice, as a bull you hurl the lightning upon the earth'. This translation would be absolutely certain, but for KV. IV. 36. 8, dyumdntam v ajam vfsaéusmam uttamdm à no rayîm rbhàvas tahsatá vdyah , where vfçaéiisma seems to mean 'bestow- ing the fire of a bull', thus involving the secondary meaning of éúsma (see below). But note that the adjective dyumdnt points to heaven, and seems to play upon the more primary sense of susma , which we shall assume to be 'lightning, fire'. Equally clear is AY. IX. 4. 22: piédñgarüpo ndbhaso vayodhá āindrdh susino viévdrüpo na āgāt The reddish-colored, strength-giving, variegated lightning which belongs to Indra has come to us from the cloud'. To say 'Indra's variegated strength has come from the cloud' is nonsensical; we must therefore look behind the native rendering balam. The word occurs very frequently in connection with nouns and verbs designating thunder or lightning. Especially Agni's flame is described as 'burning', and as 'thundering', i. e. 'crackling', and along with these descriptions occurs the word éúsma. Thus, AY. XVIII. 2. 36 is addressed to the funeral fire, and the word éúsma in the passage seems again to mean 'lightning', or some- thing very like. édm tapa má 9 ti tapo dgne mā tanvàm tapah: vanesu éúsmo astu te prthivyám astu ydd dharah. 1) That abhrajd is indeed an epithet of the lightning is clear also from Māitrī-Up. VI. 35: tndyud ivã 'bhrãrcisah parame vy oman ( sc. abhyuccarati ) 'as the lightning springs up in the highest heaven from the light of the clouď ; cf. the commentary, mahāīcāše yathã 1 bhrãrdso ' bhrãntargatasyã 'Ichandasyã ^ reis o vidyut The conception that the lightning springs from the light of the sun who stands behind the storm-cloud appears also in KV. X. 158. 2, pãhi no ( 8avitar ) didyútah pátantyãli. And cf. also TA. I. 10. 6, vãidyuta ãdityasya.</page><page sequence="27">Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 567 'Burn kindly, do not burn over much; O Agni, do not burn the body ! May thy lightning (or thy fire) go into the trees ; may thy flame go into the earth'! Ludwig, Rig-Veda, vol. Ill, p. 483, translates the third pāda 'in den Wäldern sei deine krafť; but this translation violates the obvious parallelism of AY. I. 12. 3; there the lightning of heaven is implored to strike the trees (éúsmo vdnaspdtln sacatām ); here the gleaming flame of the funeral fire is requested to do the same kindly act (vdnesu éúsmo astu te). Cf. also AY. YI. 20. 1, agaér ivā ' sya ddhata eti susminah , where ddhant and éusmín ') repeat the qualities contained in tapa and éusma in XVÏÏL 2. 86. RV. VIL 3. 6 is also addressed to Agni : divo na te tanyatúr eti éúsmah . Grassmann translates the expression 'wie des himmels donner geht einher dein brausen', having in mind the derivation of the word from the root évas ; Ludwig (315) 'wie des Dyäus donner kommt einher deine krafť; his rending of éúsma is that of Yaska: see above. But, if we regard RV. VII. 34. 7 : úd asya (sc. agnéh) éúsmãd bhāniir nä "rta, the insufficiency of either translation be- comes obvious. This is rendered by Grassmann 'aus seinem schnaufen erhobs wie glänz sich'. We may ask very properly whether a gleam or light can emanate from 'snorting', and whether it is not obviously the flame (lightning) of Agni which furnishes the light 2). Ludwig (220) adheres to Yaska, with an exceedingly stilted trans- lation as the result : 'aus seiner kraft gieng wie eine leuchte'. Hence the expression divo na te tanyatúr eti éúsmah at RV. VII. 3. 6 must have one of the following closely related values: 'as if from heaven comes your thundering lightning', or (asyndetically) 'comes your thunder and lightning' : i. e. Agni's crackling and gleaming is comparable to the thunder and lightning of heaven'. We may compare also RV. X. 45. 4 = MS. II. 7. 8 (85. 8), dkrandad agni stanayann iva dyáuh ... à ródasi bhãnúnã bhãty antdh , where dkrandad and stanayann take the place of tanyatúr in VII. 3. 6, and bhãnúnã bhāti of éúsmah . We may expect some expression for gleaming, flickering, or lightning wherever Agni is described. Very similar is the statement at RV. IV. 10. 4, pra te (sc. agnéh) divo na stanayanti éúsmah 'as if from heaven does your lightning fulminate'. He who should be tempted here to accept Grassmann's seemingly plausible translation : 'dein rauschen tönt wie 1) By the way, an adjective susmi = s usmin occurs in TB. II. 7. 13. 2 ; it is not noted by either of the Petersburg lexicons. 2) Agni's flickering flames are of course suggestive of lightning; so e. g. RV. V. 10. 5.

X. 142. 6, út te éúsmã jihatām út te arcih 'may your flames (lightnings ?) and your light flare up'. Grassmann translates it 'dein licht lass aufwärts steigen und dein schnaufen'. But út . . .jihatām can certainly not refer to any kind of noise; and Ludwig's (437) 'auf sollen steigen deine trocknenden 2) kräfte, empor deine flamme' is equally unacceptable. In one passage, RV. VI. 3. 8, also addressed to Agni, Grass- mann gives up entirely the usual translation 'schnaufen', and oc- cupies essentially our own position in reference to the word. The passage is: vidyún na davidyot svébhih éúsmãih , and Grassmann translates it 'so strahlte er blitzgleich hell mit seinen lichtern'. This, in simpler language, 'he gleamed like the lightning with his own fiickerings', is the correct translation, and one may ask how Grassmann reconciled this translation of éúsmãh by 'lichter with the translation of the same word by 'rauschen' at RV. IV. 10. 4, and 'schnaufen' at VII. 34. 7. Ludwig (369) again follows the tradition: 'der durch seine eigenen kräfte wie der blitz gewaltig erstrahlt ist'. Again, the translation 'gleaming flames' seems on the whole to suit RV. X. 3. 6, where the following statement is made in reference to Agni: asyd éúsmãso dadréãnápaver jéhamânasya svanayan niyúdbhih: prdtnebhir yo rúéadbhir devatamo vi rébhadbhir aratír bháti víbhvã. Ludwig (416) translates the first half 'seine kräfte, des feige deut- lich sichtbar, des eilend dahinschreitenden tosten wie mit wagen - gespannen'. This is simply forcing Yäska's translation of éúsma ; strictly speaking, the expression 'seine Kräfte tosten' makes no sense. Grassmann gives 'Sein schnaufen, wenn er fahrt mit lichten rädern, und wenn er keucht, ertönt mit vielen rossen'. This is very good as far as the sense of éúsmãso . . . svanayan is conr cerned. But why may we not translate: 'The flames of (Agni) whose wheel -track is visible . . . resound etc.' This rendering is supported by the obvious parallelism in the second half-stanza, where rúéadbhir repeats the idea of éúsmã, and rébhadbhir that of svanayan , in the first half. And so I would translate RV. VII. 7. 2 : 1) Ludwig (337) adheres steadfastly to the translation of Yãska, é úsma = hala : 'deiner kräfte donner ertönt wie der des Dyâus'. But what is 'the thunder of strengths'? 2) The word 'trocknenden' is due to the frequently occurring etymology the commentators who render &amp; úsma by éosalcam baiami cf. the intro- úctory remarks above.</page><page sequence="29">Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 569 à sánu éúsmãir naddyan prthivyã jdmbhebhir viévam usddhag vdnāni. 'With your flames causing to resound the back of the earth, with your jaws burning eagerly the trees altogether. Lud wig's trans- lation is as usual: 'durch deine kraft erdröhnen lassend den rücken der erde' Grassmann: 'durch schnaufen lässt der erde grund er dröhnen. There is no intrinsic objection to Grassmanns trans- lation of the two passages, just discussed, but we hope to discredit ultimately any translation of éúsma which is based upon its direct derivation from the root é vas 'to breathe*. In the nadïstuti , RV. X. 75. 3, a very successful comparison is instituted between the torrents of the river and the torrents of heaven during a thunder-storm: diví svanó yatate bhûmyo 'pdry anantdm éúsmarn úd iyarti bhãnúnã: abhrdd iva pra stanayanti vrstdyah sindhur ydd eti vysabhó na ráruvat. 'Her sound upon the earth reaches to heaven, by her radiance she gives forth endless sparkle (lightning); torrents thunder forth as if from the rain -cloud, when she, Sindhu (the river), goes like a roaring bull'. Grassmann translates the second pāda : 'endloses brausen regt sie auf und hellen glänz' ; this involves a very doubt- ful construction of bhãnúnã , and destroys the forcible comparison : the light on the surface of the water is compared with lightning, and the picture is completed in the next pāda, where again ap- pears the word stanayanti ' by comparing the rush of the river s waters with the thundering discharge of the rain -cloud. Ludwig (1001) also misses the point of the comparison in his rendering: ^unendliche kraft lässt er mit leuchten ausgehn. Frequently in Yedic texts the component elements of a thunderstorm are mentioned, as e. g. Tāit. Ar. I. 24. 1 : catvāri vā apārn rūpāņi, megko vidyut stanayitnur vrstih. These four are mentioned in the stanza of the RV. just discussed: stanayanti vrstdyah are obviously the equi- valents of stanayitnur vrstih ; abhrdd takes the place of megho. We think it scarcely less certain that f éúsmarn is the parallel of vidyut. See also ib. II. 14. 1; Katy. Sr. IV. 5. 18 - 20; Gop. Br. I. 1. 33; TS. IV. 4. 6. 1, 2; MS. II. 8. 13; ŠB. I. 5. 2. 18, 19. Once more the expression è úsmam iyarti occurs at RV. IV. 17. 12, and it occurs there again with words depicting a thunder- storm; it seems scarcely possible that the association with the word stanayadbhir and kindred words in stanzas 12 and 13 is again due to accident: yo asya Msmarn muhuJcāir iyarti vató na juta stanayadbhir abhrāih This is said of Indra, and may well be translated : 'He (sc. Indra) who bewilderingly gives forth his lightning like the wind hastening</page><page sequence="30">570 Bloomfiéld , Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda . with thunder- clouds' Evidence, fairly technical in character, is afforded by a passage in the Chaud. Up. VIII. 12. 2 that éúsma is 'lightning'. The four-fold composition of a storm is stated there as vayur abhram vidyut stanayitnuh and we may formulate between this and the preceding passage the mathematical proportion, vayur : vātdh = abhram : abhrāih = stanayitnuh: standyadbhih = vidyut : éúsmam . In the Mantras éúsma is therefore a synonym of vidyut. Cf. also Käty. Sr. IV. 5. 18 - 20, etc. cited above2). In the next stanza we have a continuation of the description of Indra' s stormy doings: . . . iyarti rmúm maghdvā samóham , vibhanjanúv aédnimãn iva dyãúh ... It is well worth noting also that the only other occurrence of the word muhukāih - itself obscure iii meaning - is in a passage which speaks most unambiguously of Indra's lightning, RV. IV. 16. 17: tigmã ydd antdr aédnih potati kašmiri eie chura vnuhuké jdnūnām. The word él isma in its meaning of lightning is synonymous with arkd. RV. II. 11. 4; éubhram nú te éúsmam vardhdyantah éubhrdm vdjram bãhvár dddhānāh is addressed to Indra. Grassmann translates éubhrdm éúsmam by 'schmucke kraft'; Ludwig by 'helle kraft'. Since Indra wields the vdjra ťthe bolt' why should he not also exhibit the lightning. Precisely this is stated in RV. X. 153. 43): tvdm indra sajósasam arkdm bibharsi bãhvóh vajrdm éíéãna ójasã 'O Indra, you carry in your arms the helpful lightning, sharpening with might your thunderbolt'4). In RV. VJLLL. 15. 7 éúçma and vdjra are also governed by the root éã. The adjective éubhrd in passages in which it is employed with éúsma , RV. II. 11. 4; VII. 56. 8, is of itself calculated to disprove the translation by 1) Grassmann: 'Er der im Na hoch seine Kraft emportrieb' etc.; Ludwig (518): 'Der seine kraft durch die Schlachtgetümmel treibt'. For muhukāih , and muhuké jánãnãm (IV. 16. 17), cf. RV. VI. 18. 8, and above, p. 556. 2) In AV. XI. 4. 2 the serios is kránda , stanayitnu, vidyut , and vársant , which suggests for kránda a more definite translation than that offered by tho lexicons, namely = vãyu 'wind'; cf. RV. X. 100. 2, where VSyu is spoken of as krandádÍ8ti 'hastening along with clamor'. 3) Cf. II. 11. 15; III. 31. 11; 34. 1; VI. 73. 3; X. 68. 6. 4) Bergaigne's well-known theory that arká in the Mantras means every- where 'hymn', nowhere 'ray, lightning', etc. (see La Religion Védique I. 279, note; II, 268, note; 279) is, it seems to me, finally invalidated by the com- parison of the two passages, just discussed (X. 153. 4 and II. 11. 4). Likewise, the expression indrâya arkavatef MS. II. 2. 9; VS. XVIII. 22 (MahTdhara) is on its own account proof positive against such an assumption. 'Indra who possesses hymns' is too feeble for a Yajus-text; it means 'Indra who has the lightning'.</page><page sequence="31">Bloomfield , Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda^ 571 'strength', since none of the other expressions for strength, eyas, bd¿a1 vlrya , hrdtu , indriyd , édvas, s aha s, tavas , tdvisï, tvaksas , rfefcř, vísnya, nrmņd, vayas , etc. exhibit any such bold metaphor. Aside from the word vdjra in II. 11. 4 éubhrd occurs only with living or personified beings, and in addition the words soma, indu , aitéú, and andhas , which require no comment; a glance at the word éubhrd in Grassmann's concordance makes this evident at once. Expressions like 'helle kraft', 'schmucke kraft', 'bright strength' are - glittering generalities; they belong to the class of trans- lations which I have elsewhere called inflated. It is certainly, again, not mere chance that the adjective dyumant 'shining' is employed only with precisely the same two properties of Indra, the éúsma , and the vdjra , not with ájas and the like. RV. Y. 31. 4 we have dywmdntam vajram ; in I. 64. 14; IX. 29. 6; 63. 29; 67. 3; 106. 4 dyumantam éúsmam. The relation between éúsma and vdjra is expressed distinctly in RV. II. 11. 4; 12. 13; III. 32. 3; IV. 22. 3; VI. 27. 4; Vili. 15. 7; 96. 8, 9 (cf. also VHI. 85. 8, 9 and the correlation of arkd and vdjra in X. 153. 4). Especially VI. 27. 4: vajrasya ydt le níJiatasya éiismãt svanác cid indra 'paramo dadára 'when by the lightning (fire) and sound even of thy hurled thunderbolt, o Indra, the highest (of the demons, or the highest heaven ?) burst'. To translate éúsmãt svanát by 'strength and sound' is obviously forced and vague. For the juxtaposition of éúsma and svaria cf. also IX. 50. 1. Elsewhere this relation between éúsma and vdjra is implied. As is well known T vastar forges for Indra his thun- derbolt: RV. I. 32. 2; 52. 7; 61. *6; 85. 9; V. 31. 4; VI. 17. 10; X. 48. 3. The same god gives Indra his éúsma in VS. XX. 44 (TB. II. 6. 8. 4) : tvastā dddhac chúsmam indrâya vfsņe. In RV. IX. 53. 1 : út te éúsmãso asthü r dieso bhindarUo adrivah 'your lightnings have sprung up cleaving the demori, o you who own the press -stone' the vdjra is present by implication, since the 'cleaving lightnings' cannot be imagined without thunder. Similarly in RV. V. 38. 3: éúsmãso yê te adrivo mehdnā ketasápah : ubhá deváv abhistaye divdé ca gmdé ca rājathah. Ludwig (539) translates: die kräfte, die dir, steinbe werter, reich- lich deinem wünsche folgen, [du und sie] beide göttlich herschet ihr zum schütze über himel und erde'. The notion that . Indra and his strength are two forces separately individualized seems to me extremely farfetched. Grassmann translates the first half of the stanza most arbitrarily : 'die helden , die , o Schleuderer , dir reichlich zu geböte stehn'. The sense is much simplified by our interpretation of éúsma : 'The lightnings, O you who own the press-stone, that abundantly are at your disposal, both gods (i. e. either you and your lightning, or perhaps better, your lightning</page><page sequence="32">572 Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. and the press -stone) rule both heaven and earth unto your super- iority 1). I have translated adrivant in the two last passages by 'he who owns the press-stone', having gotten to doubt the translation of ddri by 'thunderbolt* independently from Bergaigne, Etudes sul- le lexique du Rig-Veda (Journal Asiatique 1884) *). The passage RV. I. 165. 4* = VS. XXXIII. 78 = MS. IV. 11. 3: éúsma iyarti prdbhrto me ddrih is closely parallel, and means 'the lightning rises, the press -stone has been brought forth' 3). It would be more convenient to translate 'the lightning rises, the thunderbolt has been casť, but I see no possibility of upholding the meaning 'bolt' for ddri in two out 125 occurrences of the simple words (Grassmann), not to speak of the compounds, none of which have suggested this meaning to any scholar: adri-já , ddri-jüta , ddri - barhas , ddri-budhna , adri-bhîd , adri-mātar , ddri-suta , ddriš- sānu , etc. The parallelism of éúsma and vdjra appears very clearly in the juxtaposition of visan and vrsabhd with each. The latter occurs with vdjra , RV. I. 33. 13; IX. 72. 7; TB. II. 8. 4. 4 ; and once with éúsma in RV. VI. 19. 1 = TB. II. 5. 8. 1 4). The former, vrsan , occurs as epithet of vdjra in RV. L 131. 3; II. 11. 9; 16. 6; IX. 106. 3 (cf. also X, 89. 9, vadhdm v f sānam) ; the expression vr§an éúçma we have in RV. IV. 24. 7 ; VI. 19. 8 ; VII. 24. 4; MS. I. 6. 2 (86. 17); TS. HI. 2. 5. 2; TB. I. 2. 1. 21. To be sure the adjectival uses of the words, vrsan and vrsabhd are very broad, being applied to living, to personified, and even positively inanimate objects. Not however to abstract conceptions, and not to any of the words for 'strength* whose meaning is in- disputable. In a number of places éúsma may mean 'lightning, fire' although there is nothing coercive in the connection. So RV. VII. 61. 4, éúèmo ródasi badbadhe mahãvá , which may be com- pared with X. 147. 1, réjate éúçmât prthiví cid adrivah , and II. 1) abhi-sti irom abhi + which, never means 4to help', but 'to be superior'. 2) Bergaigne ib. sub adri-vat does not however take ¿his view of the adjective adrivant . He suggests inhabiting the mountain, i. e. the heavens'. 3) iyarti is employed both transitively and intransitively with éúsma-, cf. IV. 17. 12, é Ú8mam iyarti with éúsma iyarti here. Parallel with the latter construction we have in II. 17. 1: óúsmã vád asya pratnátho ' dir ate. 4) In this stanza so much seems to favor the interpretation of éúsma by 'lightning' that a mere presentation of the text suffices: d te éúsmo vrsabhd etu paécdd ó Hta-t äd adharād n purástãt: d viéváto abhi sám etv arvdñ indra dyumnám svàrvad dhehy asmé. ■ An address in these words to Indra's strength merely would be the veriest bathos.</page><page sequence="33">Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 573 12, 1, ydsya êúsmãd ródasi dbhyasetãm1). Again a passage like VS. Kāņvašākhā XX VIII. 14: ā no gotrā dardrlii gopate gāķ . . . divalcsā asi vrsabha satyasusmah , addressed to Indra does not preclude the meaning lightning . So also perhaps EY. VIII. 99. 6 = VS. XXXIII. 67; RV. I. 100. 2; VI. 60. 3. In many pass- ages, however, éúsma is so distinctly employed in parallelism with words for 'strength' as to leave no room for doubt that this is one of its meanings. So MS. I. 1. 11 (6, 15), Txavir asi vãiévã- naram unnltasusmam satyãujãh (cf. TS. I. 6. 1. 1, 2), admits no other translation than 'strength, force'. The word is very rare in prose ; TB. I. 6. 2. 4 exhibits it in the meaning of Prajāpati's (sexual) force: tasya (sc. prajāpateh) éusma āņcĻam bhūtam nir avariata , which is to be compared with AV. IV. 4. 2, úd ej a tu prajâpatir vrsā susmeņa vājina (see also TA. III. 11. 4); in TB. 1. 3. 10. 8 in parallelism with rasa , and jïvd it means 'vigor of life'. Similarly in TS. III. 2. 5. 2, where it appears in connection with àyus and vareas ; cf. vlráéusma , RV. I. 53. 5 = MS. II. 2. 6 (20. 5). In passages, too, like AV. VI. 38. 3 = TB. II. 7. 7. 2, rdthe aksésv rsa- bhdsya váje vate parjdnye vdrunasya éúsme the derived sense of susina must be admitted, since Varuņa's lightning is unknown. Ludwig, Rig-Veda III. 240, translates it by 'in des Varuna rüstig- 1) The root bhī has in the Veda a pendant bhyas of unquestioned meaning and apparently impenetrable obscurity of origin. Whitney, Roots, etc. p. 115 compares, rather desperately, the stem bhiyas , but this is restricted to the in- finitive bhiyáse and the aoristic participle blviyásãna-. In both cases the element as is felt to be an integral part of the ending, -ase and - asāna -, little calculated to spread on its own account in free verbal formation. Besides bhiyds - is not bhyas. To speak of -as, according to the vulgate method, as a root-determinative only marks the helplessness which usually besets us when called upon to explain these final elements. Fortunately we can substitute here a bit of information which will take bhyas from this cloudy domain into that of plainest and homeliest fact. The root bhyas is a tentative formation: in the RV. one finite form ábhyasethãm ; in the SV. one, bhyásãt ; in the AV. two nouns, ud-bhyasá 'started by terror' and sva-bhyasd 'frightened by one's self' ( svabhyascí ye co ldbhyasāh' XI. 9. 17). The congeneric root, tras means 'tremble' (r çea&gt;), and frequently in connection with it occur derivatives from the root bhī. In the RV. of three "»passages containing the root tras two also exhibit bhī. Thus VI. 14. 4, ydsya trásanti ¿ávasah samcáJcsi ¿átravo- bhiyü 'at the sight of whose strength the enemies tremble with fear'; VIII. 48. 11, nír atrasan tdmisīcīr dbhãisuh 'the stupefying diseases (or the dis- eases which carry into darkness) fled away; they were terrified'. So also AV. V. 21. 2, dhiivantu bibhyato lmítrãh prdtrãsena 'with trembling may the frightened enemies run'; V. 21. 5, yáthã vfJcãd ajãváyo dhlívanti bahú bí- bhyatîh, evá tvám dundubhe 1 mitran abhí kranda prd trãsaya 4as goats and sheep run from the wolf in great fear; so do thou, o drum, shout against the enemy, make him tremble; SB. III. 1. 2. 17, sā bibhyaťi trasati 'she trembles with fear'; Mahābh. III. 3080, bhayat trasyasi 'you tremble from fear', elc. I believe, I can fairly feel how the two congeneric ideas of 'fear and trembling' 'furcht und zittern' (note the phrases!) have blended into the one tentative formation. I shall soon elsewhere draw attention to similar pro- cesses, both in Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages. Bd.

And thus we find it employed freely as a synonym, along with other words designating 'strength', ojas, hrdtu , indriyd , tdvisi] vrsnya , vayas, etc., e. g. RV. III. 32. 3; IX. 19. 7, and in descriptions of Soma and plants, e. g. RV. X. 97. 8; VS. XIX. 33 = TB. II. 6. 3. 1; SB. II. 6. 2. 1, where it also must mean 'fire, strength'. But the entire range of meanings covered by the word is comprised easily within the ideas 'lightning', and 'fire', in the literal and applied senses of the word ('vigor, force'). I have failed, for my part, to find anything which forces the interpreter to resort to the etymological antecedents of éúsma in order to understand the immediate sense of the word, but I think it quite possible that the conception of 'lightning' or 'fire' is derivable from the verbal action of 'blowing' {évas). This etymology, however, does not avail practically in interpretation; and the word in question may just as easily be derived from the root ¿us 'to be dry', the root upon which the native etymologists play with great predi- lection; cf. also Weber, Ind. Stud. XVII. 217. Whether or not the occasional adjectival use of the word preceded the nominal I do not venture to decide. .The adjectival use is certainly rare, but we have at least one certain example in AV. V. 5. 7 (addressed to the red lāJcsa -plant) : hiranyavarne . . . éúsrrie . . . lākse , where ¿úsme is obviously !fiery', or the like. The same meaning, or 'burning is required AV. III. 9. 3; cf. also RV. IX. 76. 2. 3. On certain aorists in āi in the Veda. In the fourth series of these 'Contributions', American Journal of Philology XII, p. 438 I have explained the Vedic type of s-aorist represented by the inflection djāisam , d jais , d/j ait as an analogical pendant to the regular non-thematic inflection djāisam , djāis, ajāis. It is not worth while to look very carefully for the particular circumstance which changed the third person singular ajāis to djāit. The entire trend of the language is in the direction of such a modification, since the thematic preterites with their distinctive s- and t in the second and third persons are constantly imperiling this etymologically correct blending of the second and third persons. One cannot imagine a linguistic condition in which a second person djāis would not in the long run create a third person djait, and this is supported by similar developments in the imperfect, for which see Whitney Sk. Gr.2 § 555 a. Professor Ludwig has for many years contended that certain instances of the occurrence of djāis and djāit - he does not say all - contain the true endings s and t , that consequently the form ajãi- preceding them is the true stem , and that this is not a sigmatic aorist. He regards ajāi- as an augmentless preterite from the root a/, ccyw. See KZ. XVIII. p. 52ft'.; Der Infinitiv</page><page sequence="35">Bloom field, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 575 im Yeda p. 89; and the commentary on ļiis translation, vols. IV, p. 398 ; V. 360. Accordingly there are two varieties of the word, one morphologically aj-āi-s , the other a-jāi-s. This contention has in due time born rather unexpected fruit. Bartholomae in his 'Studien zur indogermanischen Sprachgeschichte II, pp. 63 ff. has made these forms , along with a few others of similar import, the basis of a theory of no inconsiderable scope, and Brugmann has adopted it in part in his Grundriss, vol. II, p. 896 ff. , p. 947 ff. The theory is this that there existed an Indo-European non- thematic preterite with the preterite sign āi for the strong, and Ī- for the weak forms. No one has ever doubted the derivation and meaning of the s- aorist first person singular djāisam , e. g. in RV. X. 159. 6: sam cjāisam imà ahdm sapdtnih 'I have conquered these rival women'. No one has ever questioned the nature of the third singular of the s- aorist djāis{t) in RV. VIII. 40. 1 1 : djāih svhrvatlr apdh 'he has conquered the waters along with the light'; cf. jésah svarvatïr apdh in the preceding stanza, and in I. 10. 8 ; also jdyā{h) apdh in I. 80. 3 , and frequently elsewhere *). But in jfcV. IX. 72. 5 occurs ajāis, also an s- aorist, and in the immediate neighborhood appears another unquestioned s- aorist aprās. The stanza reads: nrbâkúbhyam codito dhárayâ suto 1 nusvadhdm pavatē sóma indra te : à 1prāh krdtün sam ajāir adhvaré matïr vèr na drusdc camvor àsadad dhdrih Ludwig translates (862): 'von männerarmen beschleunigt, strom- weise gepresst wird seiner göttlichen natur entsprechend, Indra, der soma dir geläutert; du erfülltest die absichten, vereinigtest zum opfer die gedanken, wie ein baumbewonender vogel setzte der gelbe in die zwei pressbreter sich'. In the commentary, vol. V, p. 360, he remarks: 'von einem sam + ji kann hier nicht die rede sein, es ist ein stamm ājāi ( ! with long ā in the first syllable) den wir vor uns haben'. Aside from the precise degree of cogency of this declaration, it is obvious that it leaves out of sight the possibility that both aprās and ajāis may be third singular, and yet this is precisely the case : all three verbal forms in the second half of the stanza are aorists, third person singular; hence the s of ajāis must be the s of the sigmatic aorist, the form being ajāis -(t). The entire hymn is addressed to Soma, Indra being mentioned incidentally for well-known reasons. The first half is clear, and Ludwig's translation is good. It tells in the third person events 1) In the light of these passages Bartholomae's remark, ib. p. 73, note 2, that Whitney had better have left out the form ajais in his 'Root-lisť p. 53 , under 1 ji is not easily understood. 38*</page><page sequence="36">576 Bloomfield, Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda . in the preparation of the drink. The fourth pāda is equally certain, being again a description of some of the doings of Soma. Why should not the third pāda also declare of Soma: 'he has filled the intelligence (of the poet), he has gained (produced) prayers? In RV. IX. 21. 7 the drops of soma are said to have produced the prayer of the pious: (indavah) satdh prá 'sāvisur mátím ; in IX. 91. 5 Soma is requested to make, as is his custom of ^ore, paths for the new song: sd prainavdn ndvyase . . . süktäya pathdh krņuhi.

There appears to me no possible doubt that aprās and ajāis are third persons; Ludwig seems to imagine that pāda 3 is addressed to Indra, but there is no reason for interrupting the even course of description which deals with Soma alone throughout the hymn. Grassmann correctly construes the forms as third persons. The second instance of the supposed new type of aorist is dpājāit , AV. XII. 3. 54. The stanza is part of a hymn employed in the preparation of the brahmāudanam , the porridge to be given as dakšiņā to the sacrificing priest. The stanza reads: tanvhm svargó bahuďhá vî cabre ydthâ vida ātmann anydvarnâm: dpājāit krsnám rúàatlm punânó yà lóhini tām te agnáu juhomi. 'In many ways heaven assumes within himself a different form according to circumstances; he (the heaven) has laid aside his black form {tanvhm) purifying himself to a bright (form) ; the red (form) do I sacrifice into the fire'. The brahmāudana is here compared with the changing heavens; as it is cooked an oblation from it is skimmed, and the scum is poured into the fires. Thus if we follow the significant indication in Kãuá. 63. 8 : tanvam svarga ity anyän (sc. phallkaraņān) āvapati. The third pāda, as Ludwig has pointed out, is a reverberation from RV. X. 3. Id: dsiknirn eti rušátlm apajan 'he assumes black color, driving away the bright'. There is no doubt here that apájan contains the participle from the root aj 'to drive'. It is not necessary to discuss which passage, that from the AV. or the one from the tenth mandala of the RV. is more primitive; the two offer one of the innumerable instances of parallelism with more or less change of diction, so characteristic of the Vedic tradition. They make it clear that apa -f- aj is a synonym, more or less precise, of dpa -f- ji. The latter is guaranteed in the sense of 'to drive away' in all the passages cited by the lexicons. Or does apa punarmrtyum jayati 'he again drives off death', TB. III. 11. 8. 5, 6 ; ŠB. X. 6. 1. 4 also present a case of apa + aj? No one would say that. Precisely as the conjugation djāis-am, ajāis , ajāis is normalized</page><page sequence="37">Bloom field , Contributions to the interpretation of the Vedaj ' 577 by making a third person aß āit, so also the forms ahāit , AY. II. 24. 1 - 8, aérait , AY. XIIL 2. 9, acāzV RY. YI. 44. 7, and cmāz'č and naît (quoted by Whitney Sk. Gr.2 § 889 a; Roots, Yerb -Forms etc. under ]/ ni) are s-aorists, third person singular. Surely here an augmentless non-thematic aorist in āi from a root *aér (*aér-âi-t), or the like, is out of the question. On the other hand it seems scarcely conceivable th^t forms like ajāis , ajāit , etc. whose con- nection with the s-aorist is completely veiled from the ken of the speaker should not have given rise to the feeling that āis , āit are possible aorist endings. The case is precisely like the abstraction of a dative plural ending eg gl from forms like in bggl (^7t6G-Gc) tor TzóoêGGi éivdočGGL, and even knieGGi. Hence the creation of forms like éarâis , AY. XII. 3. 18, and dsarāit AY. VI. 32. 2; 66. 2. Hence, too, all these forms are in function aorists, which function accompanied the analogical transfer of the ending from the true aorist forms. And just as the endings - āis , -āit have invaded strange territory so also the first persons singular of the type ajāisam have lent themselves to a sporadic abstraction of an ending āisam , producing agrahāisam in Āit. Br. VI. 24. 16 (cf. ajagra- bhāisam in VI. 35. 21, and agrahäisyat in Āit. Up. III. 3, quoted also from the Brāhmaņa by Whitney Roots, etc. p. 40). All that needs to be added is, that, since the forms which have yielded the analogical aorist endings -āisam, -āis, - āit are of necessity roots ending in Ï ( ci ' ji , hi, ni) these endings have sought out other roots which also end in i: graihl and èarì (infinitives sarì-tos , futures éarìsyami ' etc.), both dissyllabic roots, ending in i. Again, the movement which caused the sporadic introduction of sigmatic aorists into the secondary conjugations (Whitney, Sk. Gr.2 §§ 1048, 1068 a), producing forms like the causative dhvanaylt RY. I. 162. 15, and the denominative ünayis RV. I. 53. 3 has also given rise to an occasional ¿«-form: dsaparyäit AY. XIV. 2. 20; amanasyäit , TB. II. 3. 8. 3. That is the presence of a stem in I (i dhvanayl -) has again called into existence a form with the ending ¿ li ( asaparyãi -) according to the pattern of ní: nāi-t or éari: éarâit. The employment of these worse than tertiary formations - not a single one of them occurs in the Rig- Veda - absolutely incapable as they are of giving any proethnic testimony, characterises the entire theory, which is, as far as the Veda is concerned, of the most tremulous shakiness. Since the publication of de Saussure's fascinating theory of dissyllabic roots (Mémoire sur le système primitif des voyelles pp. 239 ff.) I have, for my part, never wavered in the belief that punämi is morphologically upon the same plane as yundjmi. Bartholomae ibid. p. 75, cites (with evident approval) Ludwig, Rig- Veda IV, p. 370 to the effect that the assumed weakening of ná in punámi to nl in punīmas is 'sheer nonsense'. If, however, we regard punámi as morphologically equivalent to pu-nê-9-mi,</page><page sequence="38">578 Bloomfiéldy Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. just as yundjmi is yu-né-^-mi, no such assumption is necessary. Because then punimds is pu-n-9-mês and we have here the ordinary- loss of e in a pretonic syllable. No one has as yet impinged upon this view seriously, and the denial that pu-9 = pū is the reduced dissyllabic form of peu-9 = pavi in the same sense as yu-i is the reduced form of yen- 3 amounts in my view to mystification in the present state of the science - so incisive and at the same time so delicate is the parallelism between the two types. These dissyllabic types occur in the Veda with both long and short re- presentatives of 9, e. g. roots bhav 1-, havl -, savi -, pavì -, éarì-y sari -, stari -, tari-, vari -, bharï -, dari -, pari-, gari-, kari-, j ari-, dharì-, dami - (éamì-sva), brdvì-mi by the side of vdmi-mi etc. Brugmann ib. II pp. 896, 931, seems to be inclined to look upon the long I as a root-determinative, original I. E. I which in many cases has encroached upon 1 = I. E. 9. Now against the designation 'root- determinative' there need be no demurrer, as long as it is under- stood to refer a set of sounds at the end of roots which appear in morphologically kindred situations. But I cannot believe that this I is of an origin radically different from i' the dissyllabic roots just mentioned prove Vedic I the long vowel corresponding to Vedic i = I. E. 9; in other words the sound in question is I. E. 9. There is something shocking at first blush in the theory of a long 'irrational vowel* or 'shwa', but we must not allow the name and the conditions under which Shemitic shwa arises to in- fluence our estimate of I. E. phenomena which differ from them in most important respects. As far as the shwa in I. E. gen9tõr is concerned we know nothing of its antecedents, glottogonically speaking, and there is positively no reason for discrediting a long pendant 9. Since now 9 appears as a in the European languages we might expect 9 in the form of ā, and this may justify the equation Sk. asī- s = Latin era- s J) (I. E. esā-s). Further, the weak forms of Sk. roots in ā are producers of forms both in ï and 1. Thus jahimas and ja-M-tam: hā' éi-ši-hi to M; ra-rl-dhvam and ri-ri-hi : rã; rni-mï-te : mā; pi-pl-te: pã 'drink', etc. Brugmann, ib. pp. 931, 932, 934 assumes that I is a 'root-determinative' which has supplanted the regular 9 of the weak forms. An explanation certainly less mechanical would be to assume the analogy of āi- (ä-) roots, i. e. dhyã and pyā: dhi and pi = êã, etc.: él, etc. But here also the most reasonable explanation from the point of view of Sankrit is to explain the t of jahitam as I. E. 9, and to regard both -hi- and -hi- as reductions of hā, distributed originally among slightly different (accentual?) situations. 1) Aside from the usual absence of the augment in Latin. Bartholomae's statement, ib. p. 72: 4Sk. i is Latin Ī, and Lat. ã is Sk. W simply begs the question. Barring the existence of I. E. 9 = Sk. 1 == Latin a, one might with equal propriety say: Sk. i is Latin ï, and Latin a is Sk. a, and nothing else in possible.</page><page sequence="39">Bloom-field , Contributions to the interpretation of the Veda. 579 Addenda.

This makes Indrāni out to be the mother of Indra, and accordingly Nãrãyaiia to Gobh., 1. c., remarks: indrāņīšabdenā ' ditir indramãtã ' bhipretã na jãyã. And this again places Indrāni into a certain relation to Aditi, since the latter is occasionally mentioned as Indra's mother. See, e. g. Sâyana to RV. II. 27. 1 ; X. 101. 12. For ekāstaka see Ind.
