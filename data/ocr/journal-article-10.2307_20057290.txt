<plain_text><page sequence="1">Availing the Physics of Least Action James H. Bunn Amidst the talk about totality of language?its logic, its rhetoric, its aesthetics, its politics?there persists an unapparent action that we do every day. Like Wittgenstein's language games that we use as commonplace, this kind of action seems not to have a locutionary figure of speech, perhaps because we do it unskeptically. Yet this principle of action seems to have been tacitly or explicidy granted in history: we act upon the belief that our least acts are physically reciprocal. Each of our acts entails a compensating reaction. C. S. Peirce thought that all dualism springs from the feeling of resistance to "Brute Force."1 If I feel the wind blow against me, I have to push back to gain equilibrium. Though an act be singular, its occasion is always at least dual. In physics, least action means, among other things, that natural events use the smallest measure of energy necessary for acting along a path adjusted by the pressures of reciprocating circumstances. The Heraclitean stream of contradictory events is measured by recurrent intervals of troughs and peaks. This action rule has occasioned the oldest principle in the nature of things?Retribution, the lex talionis, the equation of an eye for an eye. The Golden Rule second guesses this "aesthetic" feeling of equivalent recurrence. "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you," has been called the leading principle of ethics. Confucius, however, used it anesthetically, "do not to another what you would not like to happen to you," in order to stress his social laws of government as patrilineal family.2 In his essay "Compensation" Emerson said, "The world likes like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself."3 Jesus said, "with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again" (Matt. 7:1). Measure for measure, this is an aesthetic interpretation which turns upon a reversed dialogue of recip rocal action, in which one looks at recurrent acts from the perspectives of the empathetic first person and of the apathetic third person. It seems that we act socially yet diversely upon our belief in the measures of least reaction. Even if I believe only in the stock market, I act reciprocally so as to be in front of the oscillations of troughs and peaks. I act according to my belief in the inverse equation, "Buy cheap and sell dear." Least action seems to be our basic code, but it is applied to diverse ends in New Literary History, 1995, 26: 419-442</page><page sequence="2">420 NEW LITERARY HISTORY science and ethics. I take this diversity to be a pluralistic telos of social action. Although some may believe in one reductive law of action and of invariant reaction, other interpretations of least action can admit incompatible reactions as ends.4 Let us admit that over time definitions of "Nature" or "Power" or "Energy" or "Action" have been socially constructed to serve the heuristics of a dominant community of inquirers, a "Whig interpretation of history." To understand social behavior is in part to interpret the theory of action that governs the narratives of a sect. If we act upon what we believe, then our beliefs will entail a theory of action. Over time, as we shall see, people have justified their ends by the least action of God and Nature enacting their ends by the most economical means.5 Least action has been the code for gauging the diverse ends of science and ethics. In that sense, least action seems to have been the practical hermeneutics of the sciences and humanities. Least action still seems to be the means of social inquiry, but each community tells its story toward different ends. So in granting that the power to act is the economic principle of least action, one is not saying that the ends of action are similarly singular. That is, in desiring to know and to reenact the nature of things, some tend to say more and more about stuff with fewer and fewer counters, so that all events can be coded by simplest units. Pythagoras's inverse square law about the sides and hypotenuse of a triangle was the first and perhaps still most elegant triumph of that urge. Both Newton and Einstein furthered that triumph with their own most economical formu las. The application of this economic action rule to the world?both social and natural?led to the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolu tion. Kant, the physics teacher turned metaphysicist, said "Nature does nothing in vain, and in the use of means to her goal she is not prodigal."6 Thomas Paine said in the opening to Common Sense, "I draw my idea of the form of government from a principle in nature which no art can overturn, viz. that the more simple anything is, the less liable it is to be disordered and the easier repaired when disordered."7 In physics this is known as the principle of simplicity. The physicist P. W. Bridgman asserted that this sort of minimalist thinking is almost "second nature," that there are "minimum codes" to be used in understanding social behavior: "It seems to me that the first attack by society on any moral question should be from a minimum point of view, that is, the point of view which involves the minimum number of restrictions and which therefore can be shared by the maximum number of people."8 As we shall see, this mini-maxi equation is the basic formula of least action. He called his minimal code "equalitarian." Here is how Bridgman's minimum code of social laws,</page><page sequence="3">AVAILING THE PHYSICS OF LEAST ACTION 421 governs material things: "I think that the scientist, and perhaps the physicist in particular, is a little more likely than the layman to appreciate that the material things of society are limited and have to come from somewhere, very often from a man's fellows. Experience with such natural laws as the conservation of matter and the conservation of energy are constructive to this realization" (280). Part of the history of least action is that its measure has been subsumed into various conserva tion laws. Does it follow, however, that minimal codes in nature necessarily imply the enactment of the fewest social laws for the widest distribution of goods? This is the utilitarian calculus of Jeremy Bentham. Other action philosophers want to stress the "prodigal" part of least action, the convoluted profusion and tangle of nature, the profligate spread of things in slow evolution. Not the rational unity but the empirical variety. For instance, Hans-Georg Gadamer says, "To be sure, we have also started to become gradually aware of how even for products of nature, plants as well as animals, the rational teleological scheme of an economy of nature that does nothing in vain is too narrow."9 He maintains that this kind of narrow utilitarianism should be countered by what he calls hermeneutics or what the Greeks call theoria: "to have been given away to something that in virtue of its overwhelming presence is accessible to all in common and that is distinguished in such a way that in contrast to all other goods it is not diminished by being shared and is not an object of dispute like all other goods but actually gains through participation" (77). Both the urge to use the least signs rationally to say most about nature, as well as the probabilistic tendency to stress large distributions, characterize the concept of least action in the history of ideas. Both minimal and maximal tendencies veer over into political and economic theories of governance. How can this be? First Principles It is widely known that the concept of "least action" was derived from Galileo's first principle of inertia and from Newton's first law of inertial motion. But what properties of inertia rendered it the first law of motion to Galileo, Descartes, and Newton? Less known is that Bertrand Russell used least action specifically to describe Einstein's general relativity theory: "This is a way of saying that bodies left to themselves do their journeys as slowly as they can; it is a sort of law of cosmic laziness."10 One of the forerunners of information theory, George K Zipf, unknowingly described least action in the same way that Russell de scribed relativity theory. Suppose a traveler needed to get from one city to another, but in between there was a mountain range. His path of least</page><page sequence="4">422 NEW LITERARY HISTORY distance, but most work, would be to build a tunnel through the range; his path of least time might be accompanied by the dangerous risk of leaping from ridge to ridge. "His easiest path, however, might be a torturous winding back and forth through the mountain range over a very considerable distance during a quite long interval of time."11 To use another metaphor for least action, you might choose to ski straight down a bumpy hillside at great speed and at risk of disequilibrium, but probably you would choose to proceed more slowly and symmetri cally at off-angles to the vertical incline, so that your trail will be a series of slalom curves of least effort, oscillating back and forth off the vertical. The straight line path down the vertical incline would be the inertial route. It would be Galileo's economical path of uniform acceleration and least resistance and least time.12 But the large looping paths are designed by the lazy skier to maintain balance or equilibrium. Taking advantage of the interfering gradient of the hillside, die skier takes alternately reciprocal angles off the vertical. The graceful curving path that counterbalances economy of the vertical against a redundance of stalling angles is the periodic path of least effort and most time. This is the indirect path of stories: the longest way round is the shortest way home. This example, however, is much too anthropomorphic about choices. Imagine a whole hillside of skiers hurding down willy nilly and interfer ing with each other. They will all follow paths of least action. Like the successive moves of marbles in a game of Chinese Checkers, all the paths of motion in a game distribute by least action. Least action is a large range measure that scales periodic performance over paths or routes in a space-time that is locally bumpy because of their wavelike interferences with each other. Zipf went on to argue that least effort governs the entire behavior of any individual, any organism, any society, and he began with a theory of language use that balanced economy and diversification, or redundancy, as we might say now.13 (He got this social thesis from Herbert Spencer, as we shall see below.) What might be called an information law of least action is a variant of Zipf s. We store information economically in codes; call this storage by Saussure 's phrase La Langue. We retrieve and use information for diverse ends, Saussure 's Parole. Spareness and prodigal ity are the extremes of information, as the means vary from the ends of discourse. In this distinction lies the first potential crux of action: all codes exist as least grammars, awaiting use in time; codes have the feeling of readiness, of expertise awaiting use, like a paint box of water colors. Experiencing the code in acts is discursive in time, yet the redundance builds to surprise, for we learn most when we anticipate least.</page><page sequence="5">AVAILING THE PHYSICS OF LEAST ACTION 423 For example, recall the fable of "Stone Soup." There are many versions of it in many societies because it retells the oldest moral in vernacular cultures: be hospitable to strangers. The version I like best involves several soldiers straggling from the wars in a desecrated landscape. Their sergeant knew that cottagers had been hoarding food and stinting the army which had been living off the land for years. So he picked up an undistinguished stone by the roadside. At the first suspiciously opened door, he blandished his magical stone. For a magical stone soup all that was needed was a cauldron, with water to be boiled, of course, so that the magical stone could be transformed into a succulent stew. Had your neighbor next door a parsnip or carrot for bulk? And didn't old father next door have a bit of herb or green for variety? Since suspicion verges on curiosity, each villager in turn contrib uted to the pot luck. The story begins in spareness and ends in prodigality, a comic feast. Information was stored underground where it lay waiting to be decoded. Along comes a transformer, a shaman, who gives the villagers an illusion upon which to act. They act communally in mutual aid. But these straggling strangers don't turn into hospitable Zeus and Hermes. They disappear after the feast. What's the moral? Well, is it about how we need to be tricked into liberality, into liberalism? Is it about Kropotkin's mutual aid? Is it about Trickster, Coyote, and Parasite, who exchange a meal for an illusion? Is it a metafiction? Do the cottagers wake up the next morning with a hangover and say, "We've been had by a con artist; why didn't we save our 'minimum codes' and distribute them sparingly?" Is it about the fetishism of Power, that energy does not exist in objects, in magical stones, like Dumbo's feather which allows him to fly? What is Power? Is it allocated in bodies, in force-field groups, or in the minds of the interpreters? Or is it about the sergeant and his readiness to act, as he sees into the suspicious lives of other people and imagines himself as they are? Does he misuse the twofold perspective of the Golden Rule, which balances fetishistic self-interest about property with Other interest? I am irresolute about the moral of this story. People can turn it to different ends, according to their sectarian needs. But I know the plot. If you drop a magical stone in a pool of water, that interruption will prompt a reciprocal and equivalent series of least reaction adjustments, so a minimal fluctuation involves a maximal distribution of troughs and peaks. In this sense, least action works like the Golden Rule of Proportion in math: a Third is needed to mediate between dyads, between the anterior proposition of frugality's law and the subsequent proposition of prodigality. Least action then is a distributive ratio that measures the nature of events to move rhythmically to oscillating extremes, from the spareness of the code's first principles to profusion of its ends. Things in nature</page><page sequence="6">424 NEW LITERARY HISTORY follow their most effordess circuits, but they distribute together, filling their spaces with optimal geometries. It is an economical measure that is humanly expressed in antithetical dualisms of maximal and minimal extremes. Hence nature and society have been measured in extremes of spareness and prodigality.14 Similarly, any maxim, formula, or couplet depends upon the inversion principle that information is high when expectation is low. Laws of social action repeat this reciprocal language of our second nature. Sypher, for instance, cites Marx's economical-ethical maxim from Capital: "The less you are, the less you express your life, the more you have the greater is your alienated life and the greater is the saving of your alienated being" (160). Logic and Geometry of Least Action Least action can also be another way of saying that most information can be chunked into least periodic ratios of human sign systems. Tit for tat In this regard one can think of logic as a sequential calculus which has maximum semantic application with minimum syntactic ratios and proportions. Its meaning is maximal when its syntactic economy is surprisingly minimal. For example, consider this passage by Kenelm Digby about the logic of social action: "syllogisms do breed, or rather are all the variety of man's life. They are the steps by which we walk in our businesses. Man, as he is a man, doth nothing else but weave such chains. Whatsoever he doth, swerving from this work, he doth as deficient from the nature of man: and if he do aught beyond this, by breaking out into clivers sorts of exterior actions, he findeth never the less, in this linked sequence of simple discourses, the art, the cause, the rule, the bounds and model of it."15 Of this passage Emerson said, "There spoke the genius of the English people. There is a necessity of them to be logical" (51). Notice in the passage that the model of simplest action guides the unswerving rigor of the syllogism. Least action is most simple to understand. It is right action for Digby. In addition to logic, least action serves to chunk information visually. Geometry can be seen as a correspondent code of visual thinking which has maximum application to optics with minimal ratios of symmetry. (Recall the wide uses of the Pythagorean theorem.) So logic and geometry deconstruct and then reconstruct the periodicities of nature into ratios of linguistic sequence and measurable correspondence. When logic and geometry are combined, their ratios are not just spatial proportions?A:B :: C:D. The ratios can also be seen as successive, where the movement of the proportion is understood as a temporally periodic,</page><page sequence="7">AVAILING THE PHYSICS OF LEAST ACTION 425 R R' Fig. 1. "The Alexandrian Heron proved that the path PRQ, which light actually takes, is shorter than any other path, such as PR'Q, which it could conceivably take. Since the light takes the shortest path, if the medium on the upper side of the line RR' is homogeneous, then the light travels with constant velocity and so takes the path requiring least time. Heron applied this principle of shortest path and least time to problems of reflection from concave and convex mirrors" (Kline, Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times, pp. 580-81). action: A?? B-? C?? D. Combined into a Cartesian "analytic geometry," algebraic logic and geometry have been the essential sign systems of the Scientific Revolution, whose first law of motion, inertia, was a variant of least action. In the ancient world the idea that nature follows a most economical path was first demonstrated geometrically by Euclid. In his Catoptrica Euclid showed that light (see fig. 1) follows a visible path from a point P to a mirror and thence to Q where angle 1 is equivalent to angle 2.16 In the sixth century A.D., Olympiodorus summarized that "Nature does nothing superfluous or any unnecessary work" (580). According to Kline, this minimum economy of natural motion was commonly ac cepted during the medieval period. For instance, in the early thirteenth century William of Ockham, a radical empiricist, taught that our experience of particulars is the only necessary assumption we need to postulate. "Occam's razor" is a</page><page sequence="8">426 NEW LITERARY HISTORY parsimonious injunction: "What can be done with fewer [assumptions] is done in vain with more."17 Notice that his is a reciprocal measure of more and less that favors the least extreme. In saying that the first principle of periodicity is a measure of least action, I follow Ockham's razor in assuming that uni-formity is itself a physical periodic measure. One need not postulate a formless forming principle, or an unmoved mover. Further, least action, though parsimonious, is never single. For it is a measure of particular clusters in action paths reciprocating with others in a recurrent group. Euclid's demonstration featured light as a straight line. In 1801-1802 an English physician named Thomas Young performed what has since become the single most famous experiment for demonstrating light as periodic waves (see figs. 2a, 2b).18 From a monochromatic source Young shone a cone of light through two slits on a screen. These projections are not seen as two bands on another screen, but rather as a series of darker and brighter bands of alternately constructive and destructive wavelengths. The distribution of bands is explained by the ways in which different sets of waves periodically interfere and cancel each other (dark), or, in step, reinforce each other's amplitudes (bright). The brightest band of light is at the center. In a series of three papers for the Royal Society, Young argued that Newton's corpuscular and vibratory theory of light should be modified so as to think of light as a "harmonic" spectrum analogous to sound waves. As had Newton, he developed his ideas from watching the undulating patterns of water waves. His breakthrough was to think of these waves mathematically as formal interferences. Although Young did not express the formula algebraically (for he was a defender of the visual thinking of geometry), his demonstrations later convinced European scientists that light's apparendy straight rays are extremely fine waves. Light is transmitted in harmonic periods. Young's experiment has been appropriated by quantum physics to explain the paths of electrons (see fig. 3). For Davies, both light and quantum particles follow a "principle of indolence: they move in such a way as to minimize their total activity" (SS 234). That is why the concentration of light waves at the center of the band is seen as a "straight" line. There is most constructive interference as the waves are most in phase. Because of that straight line, one can use Euclidean measures of symmetry as points of departure for analytic geometry: parallels, triangles, pendular arcs that describe periodic motion in circular rotation, as perfect repetition unencumbered by time. Notice that indolence and cosmic laziness are anthropomorphic metaphors of least action.</page><page sequence="9">Bright Dark Bright Dark Bright Dark Central bright Dark Bright Dark Bright Dark Bright Screen Fig. 2a.

"How does a particle 'know' which is the straight path from A to B? Quantum theory provides the answer. The particle simultaneously 'feels out' all possible paths between A and B. Because of the wavelike nature of quantum theory, destructive interference causes wave cancellation of everywhere except the region of the straight path (broken line). Hence according to the probability interpretation of quantum waves, the most probable paths are those concentrated near the straight line. Only at the atomic level do we notice any significant deviation from the straight-line, classical trajectory" (Davies, Superforce, p. 235). Inertia, Gravitation, and Least Action Least action derived from inertia. By giving two examples of the paths of light, I have leapt over Newtonian gravitation. With Newton's axioms about uniform motion the quarrel about "uniformity" as a measure begins.19 Are such uni-formities, or unified laws of motion, merely rational economies of thought or do they inhere in the nature of</page><page sequence="11">AVAILING THE PHYSICS OF LEAST ACTION 429 physical events?20 Here is Newton's first law or axiom of motion, which he evolved from Galileo's first law of inertia: (1) Every body continues in a state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right [straight] line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.21 Here are his second and third laws or axioms: (2) The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right [straight] line in which that force is impressed. (3) To every action there is always opposed an equal and opposite reaction: or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. To everyone who knew Latin, Newton's language, and who knew Euclid, Newton's geometer, these "laws of axioms," as he called them, would have been clear. To these famous axioms about the geometry of matter in motion, I add his famous law about the first rule of reasoning in [natural] philosophy, which restates the ancient thesis. This too is the Motte English translation of 1729: We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. To this purpose the philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain, and more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplicity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes. Notice that Newton's axiom about simplest method follows from the first axiom about action. Newton's logical method and his geometry derive from most simplicity in nature. Motte 's Ciceronian style is expressed in antithetical inversions of more and less, pomp and simplic ity. Motte renders Newton's axiomatic style and his method of reason as social actions that repeat his uniform laws of motion. One philosopher from whom Newton would have learned about his simplicity was William Harvey, who said that nature "does nothing in vain" with respect to the unidirectional valve structure of arteries and veins, and the unidirectional recurrence of blood circulation.22 John Locke said of heart beats and circulation that it is simply not in our power to stop and restart them at will.28 To arrest them is not in our power, if we wish to recur. As if inflicted with convulsions of St. Virus</page><page sequence="12">430 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Dance, he said, we are under the necessity of this kind of periodic action. We live and we die through variations in pressured periodicity. In the grips of certain kinds of simple periodicity, I cannot act socially as a "free agent." For instance, we cannot choose to avoid the recurrent frequencies of light and sound in motion as we write and speak, or read and listen. I can choose various codes: Morse, French, English, algebra, geometry, logic, the English sentence, but I cannot avoid the physical necessity of these moving proportions transmitted in nature through periodic impulses to our bodies. I can use physics as means to diverse ends, but I must suffer the frequencies of sound and light as agents to send my messages rhythmically. Natural recurrence is always a physical frequency interpreted in the brain and "seen as" or "heard as" some thing else. David Hume meant something similar when he said that ideas are recurrent concepts, first "felt" as literal "impressions," as impulses or periodic pulsations. His theory of ethical action was an aesthetics of these feelings. During the Enlightenment, a theory of action was emerging as an oscillatory measure that defined a component over against the minimal reciprocal resistance of other components in a group, an expression of Newton's third law. As Locke said, "All the Bodies in the World, pressing a drop of Water on all sides, will never be able to overcome the Resistance which it will make" (124). This reciprocal action rule of gravitational force upon bodies would become the first principle of social action in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Percy Shelley thought "The laws of attraction and repulsion, desire and aversion, suffice to account for every phenomenon of the moral and physical world."24 Attraction and repulsion were felt as reciprocal pulses of pleasure and pain, Locke's antithetical components of the social formula. So a moving proportion of reciprocal action would usually exemplify in its formal linguistic expression that antithetical principle. Both the assumption and the expression would usually exemplify periodic pro portion. For instance, according to Ernst Mach, a philosopher named Simon Stevinus, not Galileo, was first to express a law of virtual motion or virtual velocity. Here is the English language translation: "Observe that this axiom of statics holds good here: As the space of the body acting is to the space of the body acted upon, so is the power of the body acted upon to the power of the body acting."25 The English translation gets at the reciprocity of power by its parallel construction of correspon dent proportions. But Mach also provides the Latin rhyme: Notato autem hie illud staticum axioma etiam locum habere: Ut spatium agentis ad spatium patientis Sic potentia patientis ad potentiam agentis.</page><page sequence="13">AVAILING THE PHYSICS OF LEAST ACTION 431 Even if one does not know Latin, one can tell that the rhyme of the couplet, with its double reversal of terms, repeats more economically the reciprocal and inverse proportion. Reciprocal recurrence is both the content and the syntax of the sentence. The maxim is reciprocally formulaic in its measure of moving proportions. I think Stevinus can be so pat because he seems to be paraphrasing Aristotle: "it is 'contraries' which reciprocally act and suffer action. Hence agent and patient must be in one sense identical, but in another sense other than (i.e. 'unlike' one another)."26 In terms of his Poetics, the action of one means the reciprocal understanding that it in turn will entail the identical reaction of an Other, with a corresponding reversal of roles of agent and patient, from high to low, with a complemental peripety the result. In this sense, peripety is the aesthetic surprise of the Golden Action Rule. The conversion law of reciprocal force can also enact an ethical conversion through hermeneutics. The aesthetic quality of social reciprocity turns upon the complementary quantities in natural forces. A few years after Stevinus wrote his tract, across the Channel, Richard Hooker asserted that the primary canon of natural law, the Golden Rule, was the social measure of equal action. As do Aristode and Stevinus, Hooker depends upon the ability to feel oneself both as the agent and the patient of proportionate action upon bodies: The like natural inducement hath brought men to know that it is no less their duty, to love others as themselves; for seeing those things which are equal, must needs all have one measure; if I cannot but wish to receive good, even as much at every man's hands, as any man can wish unto his own soul, how should I look to have any part of my desire herein satisfied unless myself be careful to satisfy the like desire, which is undoubtedly in other men. We all being of one and the same nature; to have anything offered them repugnant to this desire, must needs in all respects grieve them as much as me; so that if I do harm, I must look to suffer, there being no reason that others should show equal measure of love to me, than they have by me shewed unto them; my desire therefore to be loved of my equals in nature, as much as possible may be, imposeth upon me a natural duty of bearing to themward fully the like affection; from which relation of equality between ourselves and them that are as ourselves, what several rules and canons natural reason hath drawn, for direction of life, no man is ignorant.27 It is natural to measure reciprocity among equals. For Hooker, natural reason and sympathetic love, Wisdom and Charity, are dialogical per spectives upon social action. Natural law and social law spring from the same recognition of reciprocal actions of patient and agent. This is essentially the Stoic doctrine of natural law being a complementary perspective of sympathy and apathy, of organic pathos for kin, and then</page><page sequence="14">432 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of distance from them.28 Or aesthesia and anaesthesia. Following Hooker, both Hobbes and Locke used this reciprocal measure or natural law as the basis for social behavior. Their test of natural law, of equal action and reaction, was the first canon of the Golden Rule, their means, which they applied to diversely fictive ends of governance. Hooker was writing in part to protect Tudor legitimacy; Hobbes was writing to protect the absolute sovereignty of Leviathan; Locke was defending the great Whig proprietors. But their teleological distortions of the equal measure of the common good does not sully that first principle of social action. The metaphysics of "least action" was first postulated by Maupertuis (1698-1759) ? It was to become most useful as the "Virtual Work" of Lagrange (1736-1813). Notice the definition of "virtual" in all these cases. "Virtual" here means the essential physical strength or effect of a thing, although it may not be understood in its entirety. For instance, Newton's third law of equal action and reaction is now seen as a virtual statement about the conservation of energy, though it was not so understood in the eighteenth century. By reviewing the recurrent expressions of the first principles of action, I am trying to feature the diverse constructed meanings of "virtual" action. Maupertuis derived his theory of least action from Newton's first law of inertial or uniform motion. Maupertuis thought that the path of any particle could be described quantitatively so that as the particle deviated from its path the amount of deviation would be as small as possible. Here is Whitehead's description: "For an isolated particle takes the shortest route with uniform velocity. So Maupertuis conjectured that a particle travelling through a field of force would realize the least possible amount of some quantity. He discovered such quantity and called it the integral action between the time limits considered. In modern phraseology it is the sum through successive small lapses of time between kinetic and potential energies of the particle at each successive instant. This action, therefore, has to do with the interchange between the energy arising from motion and the energy arising from position."30 Particles in nature actually take a locally curved path that is expressed quantitatively as the "least possible path," and this phenomenon over and over again is used by physicists as a "minimum principle in nature."31 In terms of the skiing example, the most probable least-time path would be the uniform line straight down the hill. At the crest of the slope, the skier's potential energy is greatest. In terms of Young's light experiment the minimum path would be the "straight" line at the center, given that all paths are averages for particles or waves. Most particle skiers would probably clump around the straight line. For Leibniz and Maupertuis, least action was the measure of preestab lished harmony that was God's way. Theological law, natural law, and</page><page sequence="15">AVAILING THE PHYSICS OF LEAST ACTION 433 social law worked by a common simplicity of action. The satire against using simple natural law as the basis of social law is built into the simple characters of Gulliver and Candide. In Science and the Modern World, Whitehead was also following theodicy, but in all cases he wanted to show that the human tendency to spatialize thought into mere things privileged what he called the "fallacy of misplaced concreteness" (the magical stone), at the expense of more accurate measures of vibrating periodicity such as the recurrences of Maupertuis, Lagrange, and later Einstein (5M33). Lagrange 's equations on virtual work transferred the economies of motion from a theological question to a question of dynamics, more specifically, mechanics or work.32 Furthermore, his algebraic equations entailed Cartesian coordinates for geometrical demonstration. In natural history, reciprocal recurrence was to become an action and reaction understood byway of periodic formulas of equal measure. Most formulas express an equilibrium of moving proportions by a sliding scale of fractional components that can be multiplied or divided, added or subtracted.33 Whatever algebraic actions one performs on one side of an equation must be covariandy performed, measure for measure, on the other side as well. An inverse equation is usually expressed as k=xy, or x=k X (1/y). A basic example is Boyle's law.34 It says very simply that the ratio of pressure to volume of a gas varies inversely at a constant temperature: Constant Pressure: . Or p=k/v Or pv=k. Volume For example, when the pressure is doubled upon an amount of gas, its volume is reciprocally halved. Graphed on a Cartesian grid, its geometri cal curve is a hyperbola. Natural history moved to make its theory of language mirror the economy of means in nature. Conservation Axioms By the middle of the nineteenth century a variant of least action was redefined by scientists like Faraday and Helmholtz, who were pursuing the reciprocal associations of electricity, chemistry, magnetism, and thermodynamics as variants of one "force," later to be called "energy."35 Cassirer thought that this reduction toward one great Power that drives all energies had occasioned Hegel's destining of a totalitarian social history.36 However you read Hegel, or whether you do, ever since these conservation laws were developed, the issue for the other disciplines has</page><page sequence="16">434 NEW LITERARY HISTORY been, as Gadamer describes the dilemma, whether there can be a "theory" or philosophy that is not subsumed into science.37 The scientists, meanwhile, preoccupied by evidence of "lines of force" in those different phenomena, hoped to find a unified field theory, where matter could be minimally reduced to oscillating "energy knots."38 Although all things flow in a system, and though one kind of force can be converted into another kind, such as water to steam or electricity to magnetism, no energy is lost even though work is done as heat. This is the first law. Conservation of energy subsumed the inertial conservation of momentum of Galileo and Newton into a larger theory about the total equilibrium of massive energy in the universe. Least action became known as a conservation law, in which the complement of laziness was work. Soon thereafter, in First Principles, Herbert Spencer proclaimed that the Preservation of Force was the first principle of science and social philosophy. This persistence of force, he argued, was the basis of all experience, and so must be the basis of all scientific organization of experiences.39 Further, Spencer dared to unite the conservation of energy with Darwinian evolution under his first law of the persistence of force: "From a dynamic point of view, 'natural selection' implies structural changes along Unes of least resistance" (FP 240). Spencer popularized the phrase "lines of least resistance," so that it has come to be the substitute for least action in common parlance. For Spencer, in all realms of organic endeavor, including behavior in human societies? language, barter, "channels of intercourse" such as highways, surplus products of labor?formal structures entail a least equilibrium of evolution and devolution. Rhythm being the characteristic of all motion, all social forms?music, poetry, Malthusian supply and demand?follow patterns of reciprocal attraction and repulsion along paths of least resistance {FP 268-75). Here is his final summary of the "Rhythm of Motion": "All motion alternates?be it the motion of planets in their orbits or ethereal molecules in their undulations?be it the cadences of speech or the rises and falls of prices; and, as before, it became manifest that, Force being persistent, this perpetual reversal of Motion between limits is inevitable" (FP 532). However one might have responded ideologically to this kind of reductivism, Spencer's popular least resist ance pervaded much technological, statistical, and literary thinking about action. Meanwhile, R. Clausius axiomated two laws of thermodynamics into a couplet: The energy of the universe remains constant; The entropy of the universe at all times moves toward a maximum.40</page><page sequence="17">AVAILING THE PHYSICS OF LEAST ACTION 435 Notice that the extreme maximum implies a minimum, in this case, the degradation toward minimal organization at lowest equilibrium. But these laws are probabilistic laws for large numbers in distribution. Said the physicist John Wheeler, "Ask any molecule what it thinks of the second law of thermodynamics and it will laugh at the question."41 For instance, Wheeler's student, Richard Feynman, figured that the antipar ticle of an electron, a positron, was really the electron on a reverse path in time. The ancient principle of the antithetical nature of primal events, an archetype of Newton's third law of motion, here seems to hold good. The positron also manifests a conservation law of physics, that particle events are invariant under changes in time. In fact, most physicists, when they speak of periodicity, mean exacdy repeatable periods of, say, the Table of Elements, which are time-independent. Conservation and Symmetrical Stability In the early twentieth century, Whitehead's contemporary, D'Arcy Thompson, shared Whitehead's preoccupation with periodically vibrat ing organisms. In On Growth and Form Thompson wanted to define the mathematical and geometrical forms of organisms that grow in "scale" according to their local "field of action."42 Notice how Thompson's definition of form varies from the extreme reductionism of Spencer, who approvingly quoted a morphologist's logic, written in 1858: Organic form is the result of motion. Motion takes the form of least resistance. Therefore organic form is the result of motion in the direction of least resistance. (FP 237) Thompson discussed minimal work centrally in his classic study: "For the principle of Lagrange, the 'principle of virtual work,' is the key to physiological equilibrium, and physiology itself has been called a problem in maxima and minima" (OG127). Thompson noted that since Euler's day maximal and minimal categories had regularly been used to mathematicize equilibrium (OG 110). For example in structuring the minimal organization of a soap bubble, the simple symmetry of a sphere encloses a maximum distribution of spatial contents with optimal surface area. Unlike Spencer, Thompson insisted that the equilibrium of physical events is different from the "steady state" of living creatures: "In the case of the soap-bubble we look for stability or instability, equilib rium or non-equilibrium, in its several configurations. But the living cell</page><page sequence="18">436 NEW LITERARY HISTORY is seldom in equilibrium. It is continually using or expending energy; and this ceaseless flow of energy gives rise to a 'steady state,' taking the place of and simulating equilibrium" (OG 6.1). Following Cannon, most people now use the term "homeostasis" to describe the steady state of reciprocating feedback in organisms.43 Thompson also conjectured about the endurance of geometrical planes, arcs, and portions of the sphere over time. They are "perfecdy stable because they are perfecdy symmetrical": Perhaps it were better to say that their symmetry is such that any small disturbance will probably readjust itself, and leave the plane or spherical surface as it was before, while in the other configurations the chances are that a disturbance once set up will travel in one direction or another, increasing as it goes. For equilibrium and probability (as Boltzman told us) are nearly allied: so nearly that a state of a system which is most likely to occur, or most likely to endure, is precisely that which we call the state of equilibrium. (OG 61-62) Thompson's surprising suggestion was that symmetry in organisms lends itself to endurance or least disturbance over time and against entropie action. Although Schroedinger introduced the phrase "nega tive entropy" for the inverse ratio between high order and low entropy in the metabolic exchanges of living organisms, the idea of symmetry as a reciprocal counteraction against entropy has not been extensively studied since then among physicists.44 What they have maintained is that symmetry lost at one "phase" or "level," is maintained at another level; so symmetry is invariant. As Davies puts it: "The lowest energy state of the hydrogen atom, for example, is spherically symmetric, whereas most of the excited states are not. Similarly, the equilibrium state of a gravitating fluid body (without rotation) is a perfect sphere. We have seen how it is a universal law of nature that physical systems seek out their lowest energy state, which is generally the simplest. For this reason, spatial order is a common feature of the world" (SS 240). Periodic form and least action seem necessarily correlated. The geometrical form of hydrogen can also be construed as the logic of its least periodicity. And here least action is again defined as a universal law of nature. Moving proportions as periodic oscillations are both the measured ends and means of any physical module. Invariance Nowadays the conceptual unity of least action has been subsumed under the term "invariance." Similarly, conservation laws and symmetry</page><page sequence="19">AVAILING THE PHYSICS OF LEAST ACTION 437 laws are now grouped under various laws of invariance: "In fact, if the universal law of nature should be discovered, invariance principles would become merely mathematical transformations which leave the law invariant."45 How did this change come about? One of the great discoveries in twentieth-century physics was the connection between conservation laws such as energy and charge with symmetry theory. The story of Emily Noether's connective insight has been variously re ported.46 First note that symmetry is itself an expression of least action. An event is symmetrical if its structural properties remain invariant, that is, uni-form, under transformations, such as Feynman's discovery of a positron's temporal invariance. Both the letter "A" and the Eiffel Tower have symmetrical properties in their forms because one can imagine them being rotated on their own axes through a series of plane turns, while their structures remain invariant. In themselves they are structural axioms. Or the letter "S"?the archetype of curvilinear form?requires a cyclical rotation through 180 degrees to reassume its identical structure. The mathematical expressions of these rotations are the beginnings of set theory. Ever since Euclid, the expression of symmetry has been in terms of equiangular triangles, circles, straight lines. For instance, as depicted in figure 1, his proof of the minimum path of light depended upon the invariance of the angular incidence of the path. The conserva tion of angular momentum, a symmetry law, is now an important principle of invariance. When one learns that inertia is now expressed as a symmetry law called "Galilean invariance" (SC 185), one sees how the same virtual principle, of uniform momentum and its resistant measure, can be re defined over time to take advantage of current preoccupations. The drive to uni-formity, to unity, currendy pivots symmetrically around the axis of invariance. And yet the idea of least action is still retained with statements such as Zee's about the goal of writing a single formula: "the entire physical world is described by one single action" (FS 109). Yet Zee also describes the dilemma of contemporary physics in a section called "Symmetry Versus Diversity" (FS 211 ). It may be that there is no such law as absolute invariance. Apparendy, there is no such principle in nature as the perfect symmetry law, for "then there would be only one interaction" (7^211). There would be no distinction. There would be only one periodic recurrence. There would not be the different least actions of stars, lunar phases, gravitation, heliotropes, hydrogen, gold, and the sub-atomic particles. Apparendy, there wouldn't be diversity.</page><page sequence="20">438 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Irresolution Apparendy, the elements in the Periodic Table evolved one after the other from a Big Bang. It may follow from this evolutionism that there is no absolute least action. Or if there is one, it will have to take account of interactions over time that make exact repetitions impossible. Necessi tarian codes will have to tolerate chance diversions and unstable diversities. Everyone does not get to take the shortest route. Everyone apparendy expends the minimum amount of energy necessary to keep on circumlocuting in one's neighborhood. For instance, the most auspicious social use of least action in recent years has been the proposal of Robert McNamara and Hans Bethe to build down the balance of terror that had been the nuclear arms race. They argued against the madness of accelerating the race with S.D.I., known as "Star Wars." The physicist and the economist counted upon the reciprocal lesson that nuclear arms are not weapons but mutual suicide. "The ultimate goal, therefore, should be a state of mutual deterrence at the lowest levels consistent with stability."47 In physics, the lowest level of stability is simply called equilibrium. It may be that our understanding of physical "laws" themselves change, that they develop and decline over time into pluralistic subcom munities. In other words, just as there is a story of human discovery about least action, there may be eventually a natural history of the evolution of least action itself. It is still disputed who "first" conceived the idea, whether Maupertuis or Leibniz. It is still disputed whether least action is a law of nature of whether it is merely the most economical law of thought, as Ernst Mach and Karl Pearson believed. But as Gerald Hoi ton has shown, Einstein came to disagree with Mach and came to share with Max Planck and Leibniz the belief in an external world of preestablished harmony, which could only be intuited by "sympathy," by "Einf?hlung."^ Scientific laws were, for him, retrospective reconstruc tions from those primal intuitions, which I would call aesthetic impulses, felt responses. "One impulse from a vernal wood / May teach you more of man," said Wordsworth, in "The Tables Turned."491 take this kind of sage testimony to be diagnostic of the association of the Golden Rule's reciprocal sympathy/apathy with the simplicity of least action. In either case, whether a law of nature or a law of thought, or whether both, as I have suggested, we still act by second nature, as if least action were a coded governor. We still act as if our least acts were reciprocated measure for measure. We can choose to compensate for this second nature in diverse ways, by "getting ahead of the curve." Or by taking one step ahead of the law. Or by not getting mad but by getting even. Or we may also second-guess the law by acting as if others were like ourselves^</page><page sequence="21">AVAILING THE PHYSICS OF LEAST ACTION 439 and we as alien as they. All this second-guessing about our second nature, our inner dialogues, our patient-agent interchanges from and to an Other, our dialectics among a group, I?Thou?It?all those diverse teleologies, all these contribute to a social point of view about least action. Since all of us divergendy act as if we are compensating for least action, we are.

The history of usage among European-language terms for laziness, inertia, and least action is still unclear to me. Apparendy, Kepler first introduced a specific term for the idea of massive resistance to motion; his German word for the Latin term was tragheit, which meant "laziness" especially, but also "inactivity" or "idleness." For a discussion of these variant meanings of inertia among Kepler, Descartes, and Newton, see Julian B. Barbour, Absolute or Relative Motion?
