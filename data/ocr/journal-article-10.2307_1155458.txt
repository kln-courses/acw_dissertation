<plain_text><page sequence="1">366 REVIEWS OF BOOKS economique sur le Soudan occidental.' The Moors had exercised for a few years some sort of control over the famous Taghaza salt-mines in the northern Sahara, which were a remote outpost of the Songhai empire, but this was the extreme southern limit of their influence. The Sultan of the invasion, more- over, was Mulay Ahmed el Mansur and not, as M. Monteil states (p. 45), Mulay Ahmed el Aaredj, who had died many years previously. His comments on the consequences of the Moorish occupation, however, are particularly valuable, and he brings out several points which have escaped other com- mentators. He suggests that the breaking of the power of the Nono of Jenne by the Moors made possible the subsequent triumph of the Fulani of Massina. It is interesting to learn from one so familiar with the country that the effects of intermarriage with the foreign conquerors may still frequently be noticed among the people, while Moorish influence is unmistakable in their buildings, pottery, dress, ornaments, and diet. The historical section of the book is followed by a careful study of the in- habitants-Fulani, Bambara, Bozo, Nono, and Marka-which contains much useful anthropological information. Particularly welcome is the author's description of the imposing buildings of Jenne, where, under Moorish influence, the people have evolved a startlingly elaborate form of architecture. The form of the book, with the inevitable exception of the binding, is good, and the photographs are well reproduced. The unfortunate absence of a scale from either of the maps is much to be regretted, but the gravity of this pales before the inexcusable omission of an index, which has most unfortunately deprived a delightful study of a little-known region of a great part of its value as a work of reference. E. W. BOVILL. Les Tribus du Rameau Lobi. Par H. LABOURET. Paris: L'Institut d'Ethno- logie. I931. 125 frs. (etranger, 50 frs.) THE series published by the Institut d'Ethnologie under the general title Travaux et Me6moires already includes several notable works, and we are not praising the fifteenth volume excessively in saying that it is the best one of the series which has come our way. The credentials which Professor Labouret brings to his task are too well known to require restatement, and all that need be said is that the volume is the outcome of personal observation extending over eleven years. It is a triumph for the direct method, and demonstrates as clearly as possible how important is a knowledge of the language as a means of winning the confidence of the people. Only so, the author confesses, was he able to acquire a great deal of information which would have been with- held from him had he been forced to rely on interpreters. The book is as well produced as its predecessors in the series, but the index might have been fuller: 'chefs de terre', for instance, important functionaries though they are, do not occur either under 'Chef' or under 'Terre'.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 367 In addition to the Lobi, the author has studied the Dorossie, the Gan, the Teguessie, the Dian, and the Birifor, and the similarities and dissimilarities which he has observed in their cultures provide excellent comparative material in a circumscribed area covered by the same geographical and climatic environment, and show that, while environment may and, as we shall see, often does play an enormous part in cultural development, the last word lies with culture itself. The volume covers such a large field that all we can hope to do is to give some idea of its contents and to stress those points which in our opinion are of more than ordinary interest. A preliminary survey of the historical and physical background introduces us to the Lobi group and their antecedents, and this is followed by a variety of statistical information, much of it based presumably on official records. Our experience of vital statistics collected among natives of tropical Africa does not lead us to place an excessive degree of confidence in them, as even when accurate they must be very partial; but their presence in the volume gives some kind of standard of estimate, and the analysis on p. 53 gives an interesting, if surprising, picture of the causes of death among these tribes. There is a good chart showing the density of population, and a number of geographical and special charts and plans which adequately take the place of a large map. The material culture and industries are well described. Copper is present, but the natives are ignorant of its use. Gold was for a long time thought to be exceptionally abundant in this area, but this has not proved to be the case. In fact the gold industry is in process of decay, although native tradition has it that the former inhabitants used to wash gold at many centres. Its exploita- tion has therefore been abandoned by the natives, as they do not find it suffi- ciently profitable. Nevertheless, Professor Labouret gives some very interesting information about the methods of indigenous exploitation, particularly among the Birifor, who, in the best tradition of the diffusionists, attribute a magical quality to this element. It is a common practice of monographers to state that natives are skilled in many poisons, but Professor Labouret has avoided such a useless generaliza- tion. He deals specifically with the poisons: the elements, their prepara- tion, uses, and so forth. (Incidentally it may be remarked that the use of Tephrosia for poisoning fish has been recorded both in the Congo and on the shores of Lake Albert.) One might assume from this that the Lobi possess a fair amount of scientific knowledge, but we are assured that this is not the case. In medicine, surgery, astronomy, the calculation of the calendar, and the division of time they appear to be far more ignorant than many other peoples not nearly so advanced as they are in many of the technical arts. On the whole this portion of the book which concerns itself with primitive 'science' impresses us the least, because the author appears to consider that</page><page sequence="3">368 REVIEWS OF BOOKS they should know not only what would refer to their cultural requirements but also what very evidently does not. Both the sun and the moon are objects of a religious cult, each being in their mythology one eye of the sky-god, and certain stars are recognized and named which have a bearing on agricultural or some other economic activity: but, writes Professor Labouret, 'on appren- dra avec etonnement que la Croix du Sud et la Grande Ourse ne les ont point frappes'. Why, after all, should they? This point of calendrical computation offers difficult problems, certainly not confined to the book under review, and the difficulty should be stated. If a tribe is so deficient in scientific know- ledge as not to possess a working calendar, how does it estimate its recurrent festivals with exactitude, especially when, as among the Lobi, the festival recurs precisely in November of every seventh year? Here, despite this apparent need for exactitude, all we find is that the year is divided into two unequal periods, dry and wet, while there is no means of knowing how many moons go to each. It is, perhaps, a pity that the two short chapters on economic conditions were separated from the long section on industry and technical achievements, to which they are substantially allied, but that is a small matter. They are illustrated by excellent diagrams in line (the body of photographic illustra- tions being conveniently grouped at the end of the book), and the material background of social life is scientifically determined with a wealth of minute details. Individual cases are clearly and concisely examined and charted in a very comprehensible manner. We also find what has hitherto been a rarity in anthropological literature-interesting statistics of food analysed in the modern manner. We might assume from these that the Lobi are mal- nourished, an assumption not infrequently made of primitive peoples, and it is pleasant, therefore, to find one of Professor Labouret's authority writing, 'La ration, meme depourvue de viande, semble donc suffisante pour cette race forte et vigoureuse, dont l'aspect physique remarquable n'accuse aucune privation'. Markets, market gods, the market truce, and the law of the market follow the normal lines of development. On the social side, despite an extremely elastic definition of tribe, it appears difficult to bring these people into so precise a category. There is no joint organization, even for defence, and most of the usual forms of political authority are apparently absent. What is most noticeable, indeed, is their lack of political cohesion on the one hand, and the social cohesion of their clan system on the other. Professor Labouret uses the word 'clan' with the warning that the word is not applicable in all its contexts, a very necessary warning. This is possibly the most interesting section in the book, as, though parallel clans are a feature of other West African societies, their organization and function have not been nearly so exhaustively worked out before. In each of these tribes there are four clans arranged in pairs, and though it is not clear what particular role they play in the tribe or whether in fact they</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 369 are opposed to each other in any way, internally there is a characteristic alliance between groups of two clans. (The term used for this alliance is not the same as that used for a blood-group, so that it is not a simple extension of the clan idea.) Neither membership of a clan nor the bi-clan alliance is considered an obstacle to marriage, but under each clan is arranged a number of exogamous sub-clans. Furthermore, every tribe in every clan is divided into two exo- gamous units (it is not quite clear whether the sub-clans are apportioned to different units of the clan or not). While, as Professor Labouret justly observes, the tribal organization appears to have broken down and resulted in some confusion, yet in effect one sees a kind of dual organization working in these tribes and responsible moreover for the chief marriage interdiction. The two moieties, if they can so be called, are named, in the languages of the tribes, 'gens de famille' and 'captifs', but no significance now attaches to these terms other than that of distinguishing between the two categories of clans. On the question of totemism the author keeps an open mind. He gives the prohibitions (many of which have now disappeared) and their very interesting mythology, but 'il faut se montrer prudent en interpretant ces phenomenes'. Mythology and the existing animal prohibitions suggest totemism, but actual practice and ritual are against it. The looseness of organization, so apparent in the tribe, even invades the family, and is evidenced in a lack of parental authority. A detailed examina- tion of the rights and obligations existing between different members of the family group reveals nothing unusual. There is a joking relationship between children and their grandparents, and among the Dian (but not among the Lobi) between in-laws. There is a general predilection for cross-cousin marriage, though it is not definitely enjoined, and it is interesting to note, in view of the difference in status between co-wives, that a father has to provide his son with his first wife, but that should the son wish to marry again he has to find the means out of his own labours or to ask help from his maternal uncle. So rare is it, incidentally, for co-wives to fall out with each other that a refer- ence to the judicial files of the colony revealed less than half a dozen cases arising out of their disagreements over a period of fifteen years. Women keep their old clan names and prohibitions and worship their own clan gods and in every way appear to be equal partners in an equitable contract, which is well summed up in the following words: 'la vie conjugale est une partie de la vie domestique, elle peut donc etre etudiee au point de vue religieux, juridique, economique et technique.' The theory of reincarnation is generally accepted, as indeed is physiological parenthood, naively expressed as a 'combinaison de deux liquides: "comme du blanc d'ceuf, qui se transforme en enfant".' Despite the deliberate rejection of certain terms employed as technicalities in European law, the European outlook is not entirely eradicated, as we may</page><page sequence="5">370 REVIEWS OF BOOKS observe in the contrast between civil and criminal law. Nevertheless, the author gets at the root of the matter in such a phrase as 'la peine qui intervient apres l'infraction a uniquement pour but de retablir la paix avec la societe et avec les dieux', and few observers have noted that 'leurs regles ne sont pas rigides, etant toujours assez souples pour s'adapter aux circonstances'. Just as there is no real political force integrating the tribes, so there is no national or tribal cult other than certain natural forces which are generally recognized and enshrined in mythology. The chief of these is the sky or atmosphere, to which anthropomorphic qualities are attributed. The earth, though distant and said to be indifferent to human activities, clearly has significance from the importance of the 'Chefs de Terre', and, as so frequently in African mythology, is the wife of the sky, being made fecund by the rain. Hers, indeed, is one of the few public cults. But the most important of all is the river, which is the chief environmental factor in the lives of these tribes and has thus assumed an enormous religious significance. With the river, moreover, is bound up a politico-religious cult called Dyoro, which is not a secret society, though certain rites are only known to the initiates. Admissions occur every seven years and the ceremonies are protracted over a year. Among the ceremonies is the betrothal of a selected girl and boy of certain families, and it is noteworthy that she personifies the river, while her pregnancy is announced in the phrase 'la fleuve est accouchee'. An unusual feature of this society, which is described in great detail, is that except at the revelation of the mysteries there is no separation of the sexes, and that age plays no part in admission to membership. It is, perhaps, a fair criticism that the author does not sufficiently distin- guish between religion and magic, to which he would reply in his own words: 'il est extremement difficile de distinguer ici la religion de la magie, toutes les pratiques de la seconde etant realisees en marge de la premiere, tres souvent par ses propres pretres, en tout cas avec leur approbation au moins tacite.' This is perfectly true, but a closer analysis should make it possible to determine, either on functional grounds or by one of the tests of behaviour or utterance, into which category the practices fall, even in a ceremonial which partakes of both. The difficulty is, however, enhanced by the substance or notion known as kele (analogous to the gnama of the Mande-speakers, on which an informative appendix is added). This appears to be an emanation from the bodies of certain divinities of the bush and forest, a tenacious sub- stance, which cannot be seen or smelt, but may be transmitted by contact and is capable of doing a great deal of mischief if misdirected. Some animals possess it, which makes it dangerous to hunt them, and necessitates purifica- tion after, for instance, killing a lion. It is not quite clear, but possibly this is one of the sources of magical power, which makes a distinction more diffi- cult. If we accept gnama as a true analogy, however, its real nature is rather something unsubstantial-energy, power, a fluid force possessing all animals</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 371 and men and persisting after their death-and it would thus fall into line with the East African conceptions of ngai and mulungu, as one of the essential elements in African religious belief. J. H. DRIBERG. Nzima Land. By NANA ANNOR ADJAYE. With a foreword by G. A. SAGOE. Pp. 294. London: Headley Brothers. I932. 5s. 6d. THE author of this book is Paramount Chief of Western Nzima, Gold Coast, and a Provincial Member of the Legislative Council. The book deals with a variety of subjects which are not closely connected with each other. One main section contains questions which the author asked in the Legisla- tive Council and the answers he received. In other chapters judgements of the native tribunal, one hundred Fanti proverbs, essays on various questions, and a short history of Nzima Land are given. The most interesting chapter is the one entitled 'Thoughts for the Reflective'; here the author puts forward his own ideas on the African attitude towards the new order of things and on African education. His views, though perhaps sometimes ex- aggerated, are sound and are well worth reading. He shows himself to be a conservative progressive, who wants to adapt the new to the old and not that the one should supersede the other. The European administrator should take the trouble to learn about the native beliefs and institutions, and for that he needs a knowledge of the language, for 'without understanding it, your position with regard to the people is like throwing water on the back of the duck'; the native language should also find a place in education: 'any educa- tion which does not aim at the use and conservation of our mother-tongue from the lowest even to the highest class in school, might fail to be beneficial.' The author is opposed to an education which is 'only literary', and he gives some amusing examples of the kind of questions he was taught to set his pupils, when he himself was a teacher, e.g. 'Compare evil, down, head, hind, low, very', or: 'What is meant by Grimm's law ?' or 'How can sailors tell when they are near icebergs ?' He, being himself a Christian, cannot believe in a Christian- ity which spells denationalization, 'and cannot understand why our names are changed when we become Christians'. 'It would not be wise for European Missionaries to break down recklessly African social institutions and super- impose on their ruins European social institutions.' 'Is God a European?' It is to be welcomed that Africans begin to look at things European with a critical eye; only thus will they learn to adopt that which is good and to appreciate what is valuable in their own culture.
