MITCHELL') and MARK HAMM2) (Department of Psychology, Eastern Kentucky University, Richmond, KY 40475, USA) (Acc. 23-VII-1996) Summary A perennial problem in the study of behavior has been the basis for anthropomorphic psychological terminology. Research has suggested that people use a nonhuman animal's perceived similarity to humans based on physical likeness, familiarity, phylogeny, and/or cultural stereotype to characterize it psychologically. One further hypothesis is that people use an animal's behavior-in-context to determine its psychological characterization. These diverse hypotheses were evaluated by providing undergraduates with narratives depicting mammalian (including human) behavior suggestive of jealousy or deception, and asking them to evaluate their degree of agreement or disagreement with particular psychologi- cal characterizations of the animal described. Narratives varied the species, the context in which a mammal's behavior occurred, and how strongly it was emphasized that the narrative was about a nonhuman (or human) organism. Species varied in their physical similarity, phylogenetic closeness or familiarity to humans, and/or cultural stereotype as human-like; behavior remained constant in all narratives. In general, variations in the context in which behavior occurred influenced psychological characterization, but variations in species and emphasis did not: psychological characterizations of all species were almost always similar. Nonscientists (and some scientists as well) apparently use a mammal's behavior-in-context (whether human or not) as evidence of its psychological nature, regardless of the mammal's physical similarity, familiarity, or phylogenetic closeness to humans, or the mammal's cul- tural stereotype; psychological terms are not used specifically for humans, but rather are 1) Corresponding author; e-mail: psymitch@acs.eku.edu 2) We thank Roy Lockard and Shon Goodwin for assistance in data collection and ques- tionnaire creation, Lyn Miles, Dick Byrne, Hal Herzog, Sue Parker, Marc Bekoff, Linnda Caporael, Rose Perrine, Cathy Clement, Martin Daly, and two anonymous reviewers for their comments, Steve Falkenberg for decisive action vis-a-vis statistical analyses, Chiaki Nakayama and Miya Hamai for their translation of Nakajima's (1992) article into English, Janis Driscoll for her quick helpful response, Hal Herzog for the raw data from Herzog &amp; Galvin (1996), and of course our subjects for filling out the questionnaires.

Psychological terms set the stage for further investigation into an organism's psychological abilities; calling such terms 'anthropomorphic' inaccu- rately implies that they are extrapolated from human behavior, when they appear to be applicable to particular behavior-in-context, independent of the species behaving. Introduction Moder ethologists and comparative psychologists are often concerned about the psychological interpretation of nonhuman animals. Intention- alistic terms such as 'deception', 'hiding feelings', and 'jealousy' have been used to name, describe and/or explain animal behavior which is sim- ilar to human behavior (e.g. Breuggeman, 1978; de Waal, 1982; Mitchell &amp; Thompson, 1986; Whiten &amp; Byrne, 1988), and the nature of different animals' experiences has piqued the interests of several researchers (e.g. Griffin, 1976; Burghardt 1985, 1996). Some scientists argue that many (or all) psychological interpretations of animal behavior are inappropriately anthropomorphic and are therefore overinterpretations (e.g. Kummer et al., 1990; Kennedy, 1992), whereas others argue that failure to acknowledge behavioral and psychological similarities and homologies between humans and at least some nonhumans is a perilous underinterpretation (e.g. Asquith, 1986; Fisher, 1991; de Waal, 1991). Neither position is new, having been presented repeatedly before, during, and after the time of Darwin (see Mitchell, 1994), and both positions can be reasonably argued or found faulty (see chapters in Mitchell et al., 1996). Yet at basis, what most sci- entists are concerned about is the accurate description and understanding of behavior. One problem for ethology and comparative psychology is that aspects other than an animal's behavior may unduly influence us to use anthropo- morphic psychological labels where they are inappropriate. In particular, people may interpret the same behaviors by different animals differently, based on one animal's having a greater perceived similarity to humans. For example, in questioning interpretations by Darwin and Romanes, Mivart (1898, p. 194) argued that an animal's physical similarity to people may sway us to provide a humanlike interpretation of its behavior: "With respect to the apes, we have always to be on our guard against the deceptive effects of their tricks and ways, due to the close resem-</page><page sequence="3">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 175 blance which exists between their bodily frame and our own. On this account, if two actions essentially similar are done, one by a pig and the other by an ape, the latter would necessarily appear in our eyes to be far more of a 'human' action." Indeed, recent research supports the idea that our psychological interpre- tation of nonhumans follows from their similarity to us, such that animals viewed as more similar are also viewed as psychologically more humanlike (Nakajima, 1992; Eddy et al., 1993; Plous, 1993; Driscoll, 1995; Herzog &amp; Galvin, 1996). These and other studies (e.g. Lawrence, 1990; Rasmussen et al., 1993) suggest that the assumption of an animal's psychological simi- larity to humans can result from a variety of factors, including the animal's phylogenetic relatedness to humans (such that great apes and monkeys would be viewed as psychologically more like humans than would other animals), the subject's familiarity with and attachment to the animal (such that dogs and cats would be viewed as more like humans), the cultural stereotype of the animal as humanlike (such that dolphins, chimps, mon- keys, and dogs would be viewed as more like humans), or just physical similarity (such that chimpanzees, monkeys and bears would be viewed as more like humans). For example, undergraduate students viewed nonhu- man primates (chimpanzees, monkeys, gorillas) and pet mammals (dogs and cats) as most similar to humans among all animals (vertebrates and invertebrates) evaluated, supporting the idea that phylogenetic relatedness and familiarity influence an animal's psychological characterization. In keeping with their greater physical similarity to humans, monkeys were viewed as cognitively more sophisticated than some great apes, but cultural stereotypes may also be influential here: Japanese students rated Japanese monkeys as more intelligent than both gorillas and orang-utans, and Amer- ican students rated monkeys as cognitively more humanlike than gorillas (Nakajima, 1992; Eddy et al., 1993). Note, however, that chimpanzees were usually viewed as less 'smart' than humans, and dogs as less smart than chimpanzees: apparently, anthropomorphism does not equate chimps and dogs with humans, but simply elevates their humanlike status in com- parison with other vertebrates and invertebrates. Surprisingly, not one study evaluating undergraduates' interpretations of nonhuman animals used descriptions of an animal's behavior for psycho- logical interpretations; rather, subjects were asked to evaluate, e.g. how</page><page sequence="4">176 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM much of some psychological attribute such as intelligence they believe members of particular animal species have, how uncomfortable they them- selves would feel eating a particular animal, or whether a given animal would be able to recognize itself in a mirror. That is, subjects were not provided with evidence that a given animal performed a given human- like activity, and then asked to evaluate that animal psychologically. In these cases, interpretations of animals' psychological nature may have re- lied upon inadequate information, such that familiarity with the animal, its cultural stereotype, and its phylogenetic relatedness and physical similarity to humans may have been the only available information upon which to make judgments of psychological similarity (see Lawrence, 1990). Scientists studying animals directly, of course, are in a different sit- uation. Researchers commonly observe animals engaging in behaviors which can be classified as having some similarity to human behaviors, and then use the name for the human behavior as a label or abbreviation for the nonhuman behavior (see Hobhouse, 1901, 1915; Russell, 1996). That these names are remarkably helpful for interacting with nonhuman primates (though not always for interacting with dogs - see Caporael &amp; Heyes, 1996) has been known by scientists for at least 50 years. Hebb (1946) noted that chimpanzees' keepers who used anthropomorphic psychological characterizations to describe chimpanzee behavior were more successful in predicting chimp behavior than were scientists using 'objective' (i.e. nonanthropomorphic) terminology. Hebb recommended that scientists use their anthropomorphic vocabulary to depict chimpanzees' (and other ani- mals') behaviors, but also that scientists note the molecular behaviors (e.g. A moved to and hit B on the head) and situational factors (e.g. A is B's mother, B had previously attacked C) which are the evidence for the anthro- pomorphically depicted behaviors. In this way, scientists can provide the evidence and discern the criteria they are using in describing animal behav- ior psychologically. Hebb's critical methodology has been developed and used recently by de Waal and others (see e.g. de Waal &amp; van Roosmalen, 1979; de Waal, 1982, 1986; Mitchell &amp; Thompson, 1986, p. xxiii; Whiten &amp; Byrne, 1988), and has led to the observation and behavioral description of remarkably humanlike patterns of behavior in nonhuman primates and other animals.</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 177 In this article, we wish to argue that an animal's behavioral similarity to human behavior in a similar context is the most important factor for its psychological interpretation, certainly more significant than similarity based on physical likeness, familiarity, phylogenetic closeness to humans, or cultural stereotype. Note that 'behavioral similarity' is not intended to mean here that the animal's exact body movements and facial gestures must be identical to those of humans in order to make a psychological attribu- tion to the animal; clearly animals might express emotions differently than humans, such that, e.g. a monkey may pluck its hair out when distressed, whereas a human might be more prone than usual to making unpleasant comments. Rather, we mean that when an animal's global body movements in a particular context are similar to those of a human in the same context (where both behaviors appear to be natural to the organisms described), people use this similarity of behavior-in-context to interpret the animal and the human as having the same psychological state. To test these hypotheses, we provided subjects with a narrative which depicted animals (including humans) behaving in a particular context in such a way that, if the animals were human, they would be (generally) characterized as jealous or deceptive. However, we varied the animal's species in each narrative to see if physical similarity to humans, familiarity with the animal, cultural stereotypes of the animal, or a phylogenetically close relationship with humans influenced the interpretation of the animal. In the first study, three animals were depicted in a situation suggestive of jealousy: a child, a monkey, and a dog. In the second study, six animals were depicted in a situation suggestive of emotional concealment: a human, a chimpanzee, a bear, an elephant, an otter, and a dog. In addition, in the first study we also varied the context to determine if depicting the same behavior in a variety of contexts influenced the interpretation of the animal's psychology. Thus we were able to evaluate five hypotheses concerning anthropomorphic extrapolation. (1) If physical similarity to humans is important for anthropomorphism, then humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and bears would be viewed as psychologically more similar than elephants, otters, and dogs. (2) If phylogenetic closeness to humans is important, then only humans, chimpanzees and monkeys would be viewed as more similar.</page><page sequence="6">178 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM (3) If familiarity and affectional bonds with the animals are important, then only humans and dogs would be viewed as more similar. (4) If cultural stereotypes are important, then humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and dogs (and perhaps bears) would be viewed as more similar. (5) Finally, the null hypothesis is that anthropomorphism is independent of which species is depicted, such that all animals would be inter- preted as psychologically similar to humans when they show similar behavior in a similar context. Anthropomorphism is defined here as subjects' providing a ranking of a particular psychological state for an animal that is similar to that for a human (measured as a failure to find a significant difference between the scores of the animal and the human). The contextual variations of the first study provide information about the effect of context on anthropomorphic interpretation, by examining whether different animals are viewed similarly to humans in the same context. (Note that, because it uses only 3 species, the first experiment does not allow for evidence distinguishing between hypotheses 4 and 5.) Narratives are viewed as a reasonable means of testing these hypothe- ses because they are the means by which scientists and the public both gain a great deal of information about other animals. Although narrative depictions of animals in stories, cartoons, and films may influence us to anthropomorphize and empathize with animals (Cartmill, 1993), narrative is an essential tool for thinking about animal behavior and informing oth- ers about animal behavior. Because scientists do not have direct exposure to the myriad animal species which populate the planet, they must rely on other people's reports about these animals. It is these reports which initially stimulated this research. Experiment 1 Material and methods The first experiment provided subjects with a narrative depicting jealousy. The behaviors presented were taken from those used to describe jealousy in rhesus monkeys (Breuggeman, 1978), young children (Stern, 1924), and dogs (as told by many dog owners).</page><page sequence="7">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 179 Subjects Subjects were 713 undergraduate psychology students (221 males, 492 females) at East- ern Kentucky University from introductory psychology courses or statistics and research methods courses who voluntarily participated in a class exercise. Materials and procedure Students were presented with a narrative, and asked to evaluate their agreement or dis- agreement, on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree), to a series of statements about the psychological states of one of the protagonists. The narrative was as follows: Dr. Gallagher studies nonverbal behavior of people and their dogs. She observed the following interaction. M, a male, and F, a female, sit on the ground. M reaches his arm to touch F, and M's dog H rushes up to them and moves between M and F, facing and staring at M while touching him. The narrative was presented in several other forms. Animal species was manipulated, replacing 'people and their dogs' with either 'young children in a schoolyard' or 'rhesus monkeys'; in both these cases, H is described as 'M's (or F's) younger sibling'. In addition, gender was manipulated for which organism (M or F) reaches his or her hand to touch the other (i.e. which initiates), which organism (M or F) owns (for the dog) or is the sibling of H (for the monkey and child), and which organism (M or F) H is facing and staring at while touching. The results of these manipulations allow one to determine not only if gender of other animals is a variable in the interpretation of an animal's behavior, but also whether H's facing its owner/sibling or the other, or H's facing the initiator of reaching or the other who is reached for, influences the interpretation of H's psychology. Each subject received only one narrative. Narratives were randomly assigned to the different courses and genders, with the stipulation that each type of narrative was read by approximately the same number of males and approximately the same number of females in each course. After reading the narrative, subjects were asked to "Please read carefully the following statements about H and circle the number that corresponds to your interpretation of H." All subjects were asked to rank on the 6-point scale their agreement or disagreement concerning 18 questions: nine about how H is feeling "when H moves between M and F," and nine about how H is feeling "when H directs actions specifically toward M (or F)." The same feelings were named in the first and second sets of nine questions: is H feeling 'jealous', 'protective', 'neglected', 'left out', 'angry', or 'delighted'; is H 'being aggressive' or 'helping M and F to interact'; and is it true that H 'wants attention'? These psychological states focused on two global interpretations: either the animal was jealous (and therefore felt jealous, neglected, and left out, and wanted attention) or protective (and therefore felt protective, aggressive and angry); 'delighted' and 'helping M and F to interact' seemed unlikely psychological descriptors for the organism and were used to evaluate the reasonableness of students' responses. Order of presentation of the questions was counterbalanced. Data analysis The five anthropomorphism hypotheses were evaluated, using a MANOVA to evaluate the scores for each statement. Five between-subjects variables were examined: gender</page><page sequence="8">180 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM of the subjects, gender of the organism initiating social interaction (by reaching), gender of the owner or sibling of H, gender of the organism faced by H, and animal species (3 levels). The dependent variables were examined in two ways: responses to each statement were analysed separately, and the differences between the responses to the same emotion statement when H moved between M and F and when H stared at and touched M or F were also analysed. For purposes of comprehension, scores from 1.00 to 2.00 are designated as 'strongly disagree'; from 2.01 to below 3.25 as 'disagree'; from 3.25 to 3.75 as 'uncertain'; above 3.75 to 4.99 as 'agree'; and from 5.00 to 6.00 as 'strongly agree'. A Type I error rate was set at a = 0.01. In addition to testing the five anthropomorphism hypotheses, we expected the organism H to be interpreted as feeling jealous, neglected, and left out, and wanting attention, and not as delighted or helping M and F to interact. We also predicted that the organism would be viewed as most jealous, neglected, left out, and wanting of attention both when facing the owner/sibling and when the initiator was the owner/sibling (because the organism may feel that its attachment to the owner/sibling is threatened), and as most protective, angry and aggressive both when facing the other and when the initiator was the other (because the organism could feel negatively toward the other for interacting with the owner/sibling, or because the organism could be interpreting the initiating of an action by the other as aggression toward the owner/sibling). We made no prediction as to whether the organism would experience a particular psychological state more or less when it moved between M and F compared to when it stared at and touched M or F. Results In general, people agreed that the organism H felt jealous, protective, and left out, and wanted attention, and disagreed that the organism was feeling angry, delighted, or aggressive, or was helping the other two to interact (see Table 1). In almost all cases, the difference between the interpretations of the two behaviors was one of degree, rather than of kind (see Table 1): people agreed more that H wanted attention, and felt jealous, left out, and protective when it moved between M and F than when it was staring at and touching M or F, and disagreed more that H felt delighted or was helping M and F to interact when it moved between M and F than when it stared at and touched M or F. People were uncertain that H felt aggressive at all, but leaned more toward disagreeing when H stared at and touched M or F than when H moved between M and F. In only one case - that of feeling neglected - did people differ in kind about how an animal felt for the two behaviors specified: when it moved between M and F and when it was staring at and touching M or F. People viewed H as feeling neglected when it moved toward the two, but were uncertain that it felt neglected</page><page sequence="9">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 181 TABLE 1.

The data were analyzed for main and interaction effects in two ways: evaluating the scores for each statement when H moved between M and F and the scores for each statement when H stared at and touched M or F; and evaluating the differences between these scores for the same emotion statement. The analyses which examine each statement's scores will be considered first. Only animal species produced main effects for the separate analyses, and these concerned only aggressive and angry feelings. When H moved between M and F, people were uncertain as to whether it felt aggressive, but they leaned more toward agreement for the child (mean = 3.62) and leaned more toward disagreement for the dog (mean = 3.25) and monkey (3.36) (F(2,665) = 5.45, p = 0.0045). People showed a similar trend of interpretation for H's aggressive feelings when H stared at and touched M or F: here they disagreed that the dog (mean = 3.05) or monkey (mean = 3.23) felt aggressive, but were uncertain as to whether the child (mean = 3.52) felt aggressive (F(2,665) = 6.96, p = 0.001). Similarly, when H moved between M and F, people disagreed that the dog (mean = 2.77) and the monkey (mean = 3.22) were feeling angry, but were uncertain about whether the child (mean = 3.32) was feeling angry (F(2,665) = 8.25, p = 0.0003). In all three cases, the scores for the child were always the</page><page sequence="10">182 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM highest (although always falling in the undecided range), and the scores for the dog were always the lowest. These findings suggest that people do not expect aggressive and angry feelings from dogs but are uncertain about children, with expectations about monkeys somewhere in between. Animal species was a factor in several interaction effects, but in all cases the differences were in degree of either agreement or of disagree- ment. Animal species interacted with gender of the owner/sibling for wanting attention. When H moved between M and F, people agreed that H wanted attention no matter what the gender of the owner or sib- ling; however, people agreed more that the dog wanted attention when it had a male (mean = 5.09) rather than a female (mean = 4.65) owner, and agreed more that the monkey wanted attention when it had a female (mean = 4.99) rather than a male (mean = 4.61) sibling; by contrast, peo- ple agreed about as much that the child wanted attention whether it had a male (mean = 4.72) or female (mean = 4.60) sibling (F(2,665) = 5.62, p = 0.0038). In addition, there was an interaction among animal species, gender of initiator, and gender of whom H faced for feeling left out when H moved between M and F (F(2,665) = 5.15, p = 0.0060). When H moved between M and F, people agreed that H felt left out; however, peo- ple agreed that the child felt left out about the same whether it faced the sibling or the other (means range from 4.14 to 4.31), agreed more that the dog felt left out when facing the other (means range from 4.18 to 4.49) than when facing the owner (means range from 3.97 to 4.02), and agreed more that the monkey felt left out when facing the sibling (means range from 4.47 to 4.73) than when facing the other (means range from 4.11 to 4.24). Finally, there was an interaction among gender of subject, animal species, and gender of initiator for feeling delighted when H moved between M and F (F(2,665) = 5.02, p = 0.0069); and an interaction among gender of sub- ject, animal species, and gender of the owner/sibling for feeling delighted when H stared at and touched M or F (F(2,665) = 7.87, p = 0.0004). However, these last two interactions are difficult to phrase succincly, bear no relation to the hypotheses tested, and have average scores in all cases which are differences in degree of disagreement, rather than differences in kind. By far the most frequent interaction was between the gender of the owner/sibling and the gender of whom H faced; in all cases, this interaction</page><page sequence="11">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 183 TABLE 2.

When H moved between M and F, people agreed more that H felt left out and wanted attention when H eventually faced the owner or sibling than when H eventually faced the other; and people agreed that H felt neglected when H eventually faced the owner or sibling, but were uncertain whether H felt neglected when H eventually faced the other. When H stared at and touched M or F, people agreed more that H felt left out and wanted attention when H faced the owner or sibling than when H faced the other (people were uncertain as to whether H felt left out when H had a female owner/sibling and faced M); and people disagreed that H felt aggressive when facing the owner or sibling, but were uncertain when H faced the other. Thus, people interpreted the animal as showing signs of neglect or attention-getting when it faced the owner or sibling, but were less certain how to interpret the animal's behavior when it faced the other. Whether the owner or sibling, rather than the other, was the initiator also influenced H's psychological characterization (see Table 3). When H moved between M and F, people agreed that H wanted attention, but they agreed more when H's owner or sibling initiated the interaction than when the other initiated it. By contrast, when H moved between M and F, people agreed more that H was feeling protective when the other initiated the interaction than when H's owner or sibling initiated it (see Table 3). This contrast makes intuitive sense: H was viewed as more needy of attention when the owner or sibling directed its actions and attention to another,</page><page sequence="12">184 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM TABLE 3.

When difference scores between when H moved between M and F and when H stared at and touched M or F were analysed, there were main effects for gender of subjects, animal species, and gender of whom H faced. Although people agreed more that H felt jealous when H moved between M and F than when H stared at and touched M or F, females (mean = 4.57) viewed H as more jealous than did males (mean = 4.40) when H moved between M and F, and males (mean = 3.99) viewed H as more jealous than did females (mean = 3.82) when H stared at and touched M or F (F(1,665) = 7.82, p = 0.0053). People agreed more that the monkey and the child felt left out when they moved between M and F (means: monkey = 4.39; child = 4.23) than when they stared at and touched M or F (means: monkey = 3.95; child = 3.89), but agreed about equally (means: move between = 4.17; stare at = 4.10) when the dog did either (F(2,665) = 5.01, p = 0.0069). Finally, whom H faced produced two main effects. People agreed that H felt angry when facing F (mean = 3.84), but disagreed that H felt angry when facing M (mean = 3.02) or when moving between M and F eventually to face either M (mean = 3.03) or F (mean = 3.19) (F(1,665) = 17.22, p = 0.0001). And although people disagreed that H felt delighted no matter whom H faced, they disagreed more that H felt delighted when moving between M and F (eventually to face either F (mean = 2.38) or M (mean = 2.52)) than when H was actually facing either M (mean = 2.71) or F (mean = 2.76) (F(1,665) = 8.94, p = 0.0029). Three other interaction effects were also obtained. An interaction be- tween gender of the owner or sibling and the gender of whom H faced oc- curred for differences in feeling neglected between when H moved between</page><page sequence="13">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 185 M and F and when H stared at and touched M or F (F(1,665) = 9.10, p = 0.0027). Overall for this interaction, people agreed that H felt ne- glected when H moved between M and F and when H stared at and touched M (mean range from 3.78 to 4.18), but that they were uncer- tain whether H felt neglected when staring at and touching F (mean range 3.37 to 3.47). There was also an interaction between animal species and gender of owner or sibling for the difference in scores for feeling delighted when H moved between M and F and when H stared at and touched M or F (F(2,665) = 5.91, p = 0.0028), and another interaction for gender of subject, animal species, and gender of whom H faced for differences in scores for feeling delighted when H moved between M and F and when H stared at and touched M or F (F(2,665) = 6.57, p = 0.0015), but both of these were concerned with differences in degree of disagreement. Discussion In general, nonhumans and humans depicted similarly as behaving agents were interpreted as psychologically similar. Overwhelmingly, the important factors in the psychological interpretation of H had to do with the organ- ism's behaviors and its relationships to the other organisms it reacted to, particularly whether the owner/sibling or the other were whom the organism faced and, less importantly, whether the owner/sibling or the other initi- ated their interaction. As predicted, the organism was viewed as feeling more attention-getting motivations and emotions when the owner/sibling initiated the interaction with the other and when the organism faced the owner/sibling; and the organism was viewed as feeling more protective (but not more aggressive or angry) when the other initiated the interaction with the owner/sibling. Contrary to prediction, however, the organism's facing the other did not result in agreement that the organism had protec- tive, aggressive, or angry feelings. In relation to the five anthropomorphism hypotheses, the data are not particularly discriminating. Only hypothesis 1, that psychological similarity between humans and nonhumans results from physical similarity, is not supported. In almost all cases people viewed the dog, monkey and child as essentially similar, either because this interpretation fits with the cultural expectation (hypothesis 4), or because people do not use animal species as a factor in interpreting psychological states of mammalian organisms</page><page sequence="14">186 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM (hypothesis 5), or from a combination of viewing the monkeys as similar to the child because of phylogenetic closeness to humans (hypothesis 2) and the dog as similar because of its familiarity (hypothesis 3). Remember, however, that whereas in the present study monkeys, dogs and human children are considered essentially identical psychologically, in previous studies dogs, monkeys and humans were not viewed as identical in cognitive abilities. American (US) undergraduates rated, on a 10-point scale, other humans as 9.7 for similarity to themselves in cognition, but monkeys as 7.3 and dogs as 6.6 (Eddy et al., 1993, p. 93); and Japanese undergraduates showed the same trend when rating nonhumans' intelli- gence on a 100-point scale with humans having a value of 100: Japanese monkeys received a score of 71, and dogs a score of 64 (Nakajima, 1992). A less strong but similar trend was also found for a US-sample which in- cluded many nonstudents: on a 6-point scale evaluating smartness, people rated humans as 4.3, monkeys as 4.2, and dogs as 4.1 (Driscoll, 1995). Thus, even if students view animals in the abstract as having particular psychological abilities distinct from those of humans, when these same animals are presented in a narrative in which they exhibit behavior sugges- tive of jealousy (or protectiveness), undergraduates view them as having essentially the same emotions as humans in the same situation. Of course these undergraduates might have rated human children with a lower score than they rated humans as a group: undergraduates asked to rank, on a 7-point scale, the reasonableness of attributing various psychological ca- pacities (including perception, emotion, and foresight) to children, dogs, and other animals (where adult humans would clearly rank a 7 for all ca- pacities), gave overall average scores of 6.07 to children and 4.92 to dogs (Rasmussen et al., 1993). However, the differences between children and dogs and between monkeys and dogs predicted from other studies were not observed in our study. In the present study, the only instances supporting a divergence between humans and nonhumans showed minor differences. People exhibited uncer- tainty about the child's anger and aggressiveness but greater disagreement about these characterizations for the dog and monkey and, although they agreed that dog, monkey and child felt left out and wanted attention, they showed varying degrees in their strength of agreement for the different species in similar contexts. In all other aspects of their psychology ex-</page><page sequence="15">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 187 amined, dogs, monkeys and humans received statistically indistinguishable scores. Experiment 2 Material and methods One interpretation of Experiment 1 is that so very few species differences were obtained because the subjects simply interpreted the narrative as if it were about humans, even though told it was not about humans. The second study provided subjects with a narrative depicting emotional concealment, and tested more explicitly the five hypotheses by including more animal species and by emphasizing that the narrative was about nonhumans (or, in one case, about humans). The narrative is taken largely from instances of feigned interest by chimpanzees described by de Waal (1986, p. 230-231, see Fig. 14-1). One instance (out of many similar instances) is presented in a photograph, in which a male chimpanzee 'Luit ... was sitting with an attractive female ..., but now that a dominant male has pushed him aside he is examining his fingernails with studied interest.' In de Waal's (1986, p. 230) carefully worded view, "Chimpanzees may turn their attention to something unimportant as a way of hiding apparent embarrassment or disappointment. Thus, after a negative experience they may carefully inspect details of their own body ..., similar to the way a tennis player concentrates on the strings of his or her racket after a bad return." Depictions of humans attending to their fingers after an emotionally disturbing event in an attempt to hide their thoughts and feelings are common in realistic novels and seem likely to be observed using naturalistic observation (though we have uncovered no such observations). Subjects Subjects were 748 undergraduate psychology students (208 males, 540 females) at Eastern Kentucky University from introductory psychology courses or statistics and research meth- ods courses who voluntarily participated in a class exercise. Testing took place in classes other than those used in Experiment 1. Materials and procedure Students were presented with a narrative, and asked to evaluate their agreement or dis- agreement, on a Likert scale from l(strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree), to a series of statements about the psychological states of one of the animal protagonists. Narratives were presented in one of three slightly different ways (the second and third way are described after the first way is described fully). The first way produced the following narrative: "Patricia Ekman studies nonverbal behavior of chimpanzees. She observed the fol- lowing interaction in a nature park: B, a male, is with S, a female, comfortably stroking her. G, another male, moves to S, and begins to stroke her. B turns away from S and looks intently at his hand."</page><page sequence="16">188 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM Six different mammal species were used: humans, chimpanzees, elephants, bears, otters, and dogs. Because they do not have hands, the elephant looked at his foot, and the bear, dog, and otter each looked at his paw. Also, dogs were described as 'nuzzling' rather than 'stroking' S, as the latter seemed unbelievable. Each subject received only one narrative. Narratives were randomly assigned to the different courses and genders, with the stipulation that each type of narrative was read by about the same number of males and approximately the same number of females in each course. All six species, when thought about abstractly, received widely varing evaluations of cognitive abilities and emotional experiences: on a 10-point scale comparing cognitive abilities of other organisms to their own, American undergraduates on average rated other humans as 9.7, chimpanzees as 7.5, dogs as 6.6, and elephants as 3.8 (Eddy et al., 1993); on a 100-point scale of intelligence with humans receiving a value of 100, Japanese undergrad- uates on average similarly rated chimpanzees as 75, dogs as 64, bears as 51, and elephants as 48 (Nakajima, 1992); on a 5-point scale measuring various psychological abilities and experiences (with a score of 5 indicating 'human-like' psychological states), American un- dergraduates on average rated chimpanzees as 4.1 and dogs as 3.7 (see Herzog &amp; Galvin, 1996, for details; raw data from Hal Herzog); and on a 6-point scale ranging from stupid (1) to smart (6), Americans who were co-workers, friends and family members of students rated humans as 4.3, chimpanzees as 4.5, dogs as 4.1, elephants as 3.5, and otters as 3.6 (Driscoll, 1995). (In this last study, the smartness score for dolphins (4.8) and chimpanzees was higher than that for humans, perhaps because the subjects had met many stupid humans, but not many chimpanzees and dolphins, stupid or otherwise.) In general, otters, bears, and elephants received low scores, chimpanzees and humans high scores, and dogs mid-range scores; and in the three of the four studies in which the psychology of nonhuman animals was directly compared to that of humans, chimpanzees received lower scores than humans. After reading the narrative, subjects were asked to "Please read carefully the following statements about B and circle the number that corresponds to your interpretation of B". Six statements asked about B's psychological state 'after G stroked (or nuzzled) S': was B 'upset', 'embarrassed', 'delighted', 'angry', 'afraid', or 'jealous'? Nine statements asked about B's psychological state 'when B looks at his paw': is B 'very interested in looking at it', 'pretending to be interested in looking at it', 'thoughtful', 'thinking about what to do next', 'indifferent to what just happened with G and S', 'feigning indifference', 'trying to deceive G about his indifference', 'trying to save face', or 'trying to hide his feelings'? These psychological states were chosen because they are similar to the ones used by de Waal to describe chimpanzees in similar situations (specifically: upset, embarrassed, pretending to be interested in looking at paw/hand/foot, thoughtful, thinking about what to do next, feigning indifference, trying to deceive about indifference, trying to save face, and trying to hide feelings), they seemed plausible but were not used by de Waal (specifically: angry, afraid, and jealous), or they seemed implausible and could therefore be used to check on the reasonableness of students' evaluations (specifically: delighted and very interested in looking at paw/hand/foot). Order of presentation of the questions was counterbalanced. The narrative was presented in two other ways. In the second way, the names of two of the animals were changed to make them more easily distinguishable (as Male and Female): B was changed to M, and S was changed to F. Also, the phrase 'in a nature park' was deleted, and the following sentence was placed after the behavioral description of the animals, using the appropriate animal species: for example, "Dr. Ekman is particularly interested in how</page><page sequence="17">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 189 people interpret the behavior of chimpanzees, and so she is asking people to interpret this incident in terms of what they think is true of chimpanzees." This change was intended to emphasize that Dr. Ekman was observing a nonhuman (or, in the one case, a human). In the third way, the above changes were retained, and a photograph of the animal was presented. After the first statement, the sentence "Here is a picture of one of her subjects." was presented. The photograph was intended to emphasize further that a nonhuman (or, again, a human) was being discussed. The rest of the narrative continued on another page. The photographs were all full body color pictures, except for the photograph of the human, and measured about 3.5 x 2.5 inches. The human photo showed a man of Caucasian or Asian ethnicity, wearing a T-shirt and shorts, working on a sculpture; from his knees down is hidden by a table. This photo was taken from a National Geographic Magazine. The dog photo is of a terrier with grey and white hair and red dog licence, sitting on a blue chair staring directly into the camera. The elephant photo shows an African elephant with short tusks standing on grass with a purple background, and the chimpanzee photo shows an adult bonobo sitting on a tree staring directly at the camera, with its hand curled in front of it and its middle finger touching its mouth. Both the elephant and chimpanzee photos are taken from the 1993 CARDZTM collection of the Zoological Society of San Diego. The bear photo shows an open-mouthed polar bear on its back in snow, seemingly getting up from a reclined position such that its face is visible; it seems to be looking to the left of the viewer. The otter photo shows an otter (eyes closed) resting on its back in blue water, with kelp resting on its stomach and its back feet and tail visible above the water. These last two photos were taken from a 1993 'Images of nature' brochure promoting photographer Thomas Mangelsen's work; the photos are numbers 1519 and 1459, respectively. Data analysis The five anthropomorphism hypotheses were evaluated, as was the hypothesis that empha- sizing the animal species either verbally or both verbally and visually would lead to less anthropomorphism than when the animal species was not emphasized. MANOVA was used to evaluate the scores for each statement. Three between-subjects variables were examined: gender of the subjects, the type of narrative (3 levels: original, animal emphasized ver- bally, or animal emphasized verbally and visually), and animal species (6 levels). As in Experiment 1, scores from 1.00 to 2.00 are designated as 'strongly disagree'; from 2.01 to below 3.25 as 'disagree'; from 3.25 to 3.75 as 'uncertain'; above 3.75 to 4.99 as 'agree'; and from 5.00 to 6.00 as 'strongly agree'. A Type I error rate was set at a = 0.01. Based upon de Waal's analysis, we predicted that people would agree that the organism was upset, pretending to be interested in his paw/hand/foot, feigning indifference, trying to deceive about indifference, trying to save face, trying to hide feelings, thoughtful, and thinking about what to do next. Because, unlike de Waal's description, we did not include another male's pushing the organism away from the female, we were not sure whether people would agree that the organism was angry, afraid, jealous or embarrassed, but these seemed potentially plausible interpretations. We also expected that people would disagree that the organism felt delighted and very interested in his paw/hand/foot.</page><page sequence="18">190 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM Results In general, people agreed that the animals of all six mammalian species were upset, jealous, thinking about what to do next, and angry; were un- certain about whether the animals were trying to hide feelings, feigning in- difference, or thoughtful; disagreed that the animals were deceiving about their indifference, trying to save face, embarrassed, pretending interest, indifferent, afraid, or very interested in their paw/hand/foot; and strongly disagreed that the animals were delighted (see Table 4). In the context of our predictions, it is surprising that people were uncertain about or dis- agreed with the idea that the animal was experiencing any of the nexus of psychological states indicating pretense, deception or feigning; rather than being viewed as dissembling in relation to the supplanting male or the fe- male, the organism was apparently viewed as jealously thinking about his next step in frustrated anger. (Subjects' uncertainty rating about whether the organism was 'thoughtful' in contrast to their agreement for 'think- ing about what to do next' apparently derives, according to some subjects questioned, from their interpreting 'thoughtful' as 'considerate'.) The various methods of presenting the narrative to emphasize the non- humanness of (most of) the characters had no effect on scores for any of TABLE 4.

Fe- males agreed that the animal was trying to hide his feelings (mean = 3.81), but males (mean = 3.37) were uncertain (F(1,712) = 11.59, p = 0.0007); and, although both males (mean = 2.97) and females (mean = 2.66) disagreed that the animal was afraid, females disagreed more than males (F(1,712) = 7.90, p = 0.0051). Although subjects agreed that animals of all species were thinking about what to do next, they agreed most about humans (mean = 4.75), less about chimpanzees (mean = 4.24) and elephants (mean = 4.26), and least about dogs (mean = 4.03), bears (mean = 4.02), and otters (mean = 4.04) (F(5,712) = 5.92, p = 0.0001). (Note that the relative standing of the elephant here differs from that in the Nakajima (1992), Eddy et al. (1993), and Driscoll (1995) stud- ies, where elephants were rated among the least cognitive or intelligent mammals.) Subjects were uncertain as to whether the dog was pretending to be interested in his paw (mean = 3.55), but disagreed that all other species were pretending to be interested in their hand or foot (means: elephant = 3.24, human = 3.04, bear = 2.98, chimp = 2.86, otter = 2.78; F(5,712) = 3.76, p = 0.0023). And subjects disagreed that any an- imal was very interested in his hand/paw/foot, but more strongly about the elephant (mean = 1.55) and dog (mean = 1.93) than about the hu- man (mean = 2.10), chimpanzee (mean = 2.31), bear (mean = 2.56) or otter (mean = 2.26) (F(5,712) = 8.70, p = 0.0001). (Note that, for all animal species, subjects disagreed more that the organism was very interested in its appendage than that the organism was pretending to be interested in its appendage.) Finally, males and females agreed about equally that the human (means = 4.68, 4.69), chimp (means = 4.53, 4.58), and otter (means = 4.47, 4.46) were jealous, but males (mean = 5.09) agreed more than females (mean = 4.69) that the elephant was jealous, females (mean = 4.48) agreed more than males (mean = 4.31) that the dog was jealous, and females (mean = 4.79) agreed that the bear was jealous whereas males (mean = 3.72) were uncertain (F(5,712) = 3.31, p = 0.0058). Subjects in the present study agreed on average that humans experienced 5 psychological states: thinking about what to do next (mean = 4.75), upset</page><page sequence="20">192 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM (mean = 4.72), jealous (mean = 4.69), angry (mean = 4.27), and trying to hide feelings (mean = 3.754). (The average ranks of these 5 psychological states for each species are presented in Fig. 1. All other psychological states received means lower than 3.75 for all species; for humans, the next highest mean after these 5 scores is 3.508, for thoughtful.) Of these 5 scores, only jealousy, thinking about what to do next, and trying to hide feelings are suggestive of the cognitive abilities evaluated by prior studies. For example, Herzog &amp; Galvin (1996) combined ratings of an organism's intelligence, ability to experience consciousness and emotions, and ability to reason and have self-awareness for their overall 'cognition' score; Eddy et al. (1993) combined ratings of an organism's ability to deceive, recognize itself in a mirror, and distinguish intentional from nonintentional actions for their 'cognition' scores; and Nakajima (1992) and Driscoll (1995) used evaluations of an organism's overall intelligence (cleverness and smartness, respectively). To compare generalized 'cognition' scores for the species evaluated in all five studies, one can convert the average score for the 3 psychological states suggestive of cognitive abilities in the present study, and the average cognition or intelligence scores from the four previous studies, to a com- mon scale by dividing each species' average score by the average human * Human * Chimpanzee 0 Dog t i4.75 ng a t w t o Elephaan tt O Bear Am ~Otter C w 4.25 3.75 3.25 thinking about what to do upset jealous angry trying to hide feelings Fig. 1. Average ranks (on 6-point scale) for those psychological states which subjects agreed that at least some species possessed.</page><page sequence="21">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 193 score (such that humans always achieve a 1). (Again, raw data for the Herzog &amp; Galvin study were supplied by Hal Herzog.) For the Nakajima and Herzog &amp; Galvin studies, the human species receives the maximum possible score by definition. In the present study and the other two studies, however, humans receive less than the maximum score: humans averaged only a 4.4 out of 6 in our study, 4.3 out of 6 in the Driscoll study, and 9.7 out of 10 in the Eddy et al. study. The converted 'cognition' scores for humans, chimpanzees, dogs, elephants, bears and otters (when available) from all five studies are presented in Fig. 2, and suggest that the psychol- ogy of nonhuman organisms is typically evaluated as different when these organisms are conceived in the abstract, but as remarkably similar when these organisms are depicted as behaving. Note that, if all 5 scores agreed upon for humans in the present study (rather than just 3 of the 5) were used to devise the overall 'cognition' score, the range across species would decrease from 0.10 to 0.09; and if all 15 scores were used, the range would further decrease to 0.05. Even if the category with the greatest range across species - 'thinking about what to do next' - were used, the range here is only 0.15, which is less than the smallest range of the other four studies, that of 0.23 in the Driscoll study. Thus, even when the cognition of the different animal species in the present study is evaluated in diverse ways, these species are not believed 1.0 UHuman 0.8 Nakajima E Chimpanzee Fig. 2.

Discussion Most of the effects of animal species were differences of degree, rather than of kind. In general, subjects' scores were anthropomorphic, in that they gave the same scores to humans as to other animals. However, contrary to de Waal's (1986, p. 230) interpretation of chimpanzees in similar situations as feigning interest and concealing emotions, and contrary to claims that such an interpretation is anthropomorphic (e.g. Kummer et al., 1990), sub- jects disagreed that the organism (including the human and chimpanzee) was pretending to be interested in his paw/hand/foot (although subjects were uncertain about the dog), trying to save face, or trying to deceive about his indifference, and were uncertain as to whether or not the organ- ism was feigning indifference or trying to hide feelings (although females agreed that the organism was trying to hide feelings). (Note that subjects agreed that the elephant, dog, and human were trying to hide feelings, but were uncertain about the other animals - see Fig. 1. However, there was no main effect of species for trying to hide feelings, and the average score expressed uncertainty.) Indeed, the only psychological characteriza- tion which subjects attributed more to humans than to any other animal (statistically speaking) was thinking about what to do next; but even here all other animal species were also viewed as thinking about what to do next. In addition, all of these similar characterizations were prevalent even when the specific types of organism, the nonhumanness of the animals, and the humanness of the human were emphasized, suggesting that people use the behavior of the organism in a particular context to interpret its psycho- logical characterization, and in making this characterization are relatively unconcerned about the organism's cultural stereotype, or its phylogenetic closeness, physical similary, or familiarity in relation to humans. General discussion Taken together, the two experiments support the contention that, to inter- pret the animal's psychology, naive readers use an animal's behavior in a particular context, including the animal's relationship with other animals</page><page sequence="23">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 195 toward whom it behaves and even the behavior of other animals whose actions it perceives but with whom it does not interact. These findings con- trast sharply with findings of species differences in people's interpretations of animals when these animals are evaluated for cognitive and emotional abilities without any behavioral evidence of their abilities. Although under- graduates apply a 'phylogenetic scale' in their attributions of psychological states to animals when considering these organisms in the abstract (Eddy et al., 1993), they apparently feel it appropriate to use a psychological term to describe an animal's behavior in a particular context which is similar to human behavior-in-context, at least when the animals are mammals de- picted as behaving actors. In the abstract, undergraduates (and presumably people in general) may attribute more human-like psychological charac- terizations to primates and pets than to nonprimate nonpet mammals, but when provided with mammals behaving similarly in a particular context, people generally attribute the same psychological characterizations to all mammals evaluated. What mammals do in a particular context appears to be the most im- portant determinant for people's perception of their psychology (Bennett, 1964/1971, p. 100). When people use psychological terms to describe hu- man behaviors they use, for their criteria, context-specific behaviors which can be enacted by other animals as well. Thus, psychological characteriza- tions depicted as 'anthropomorphic' are not dependent upon the application of human-specific terminology to nonhuman organisms (Mitchell, 1996a; contra Blumberg &amp; Wasserman, 1995). Rather, mammalian behavior-in- context is read, independent of species, as indicating a particular psycho- logical description. Critics of this view might argue (as did one anonymous reviewer) that the subjects in the present study simply evaluated the narrative and asked them- selves how they would feel under the described conditions, independent of the animal's behavior, and attributed the emotions and psychological states they would experience to the mammal. In this view, as long as the animal was similar enough to humans, full anthropomorphic attribution would be made. There are several problems with this view. First, even when at- tributing psychological states to other humans, normally people do not ask themselves what they would feel in the other person's situation (and if they do, it does not necessarily lead to accurate expectations). Rather, humans</page><page sequence="24">196 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM look to the plausibility of their judgment of what another is feeling or think- ing in relation to the behavior and context of the other; indeed, they do the same when describing many of their own feelings and thoughts (Nisbett &amp; Wilson, 1977). Second, the animal's behavior is an integral part of the narrative, and cannot be discounted. If the context were identical but the protagonist in the first story bit the animal he faced, or in the second story jumped off a cliff, the psychological interpretation would presumably be different. Third, what counts as 'similar enough to humans' is difficult to decide. If animals must be perceived as similar to humans to receive anthropo- morphic attributions, it is unclear why elephants, otters, and bears, which were perceived as dissimilar to humans in cognition and emotion when evaluated in the abstract, are perceived as almost identical to humans in cognition and emotion when depicted in a narrative. (Apparently, the nar- rative itself influences subjects to evaluate mammals in the same way they evaluate themselves and other humans - by their behavior-in-context, not by extrapolation from introspection or by imagining that the mammals are humans.) Still, we do not argue that an animal's species has no effect on people's interpretation of its psychology. For example, in Experiment 1, undergraduates were sensitive to species in their attributions of aggressive- ness and anger, and were influenced by species as well as other factors (e.g. gender) in attributions of wanting attention and feeling left out. Whether or not people would view 'lower' vertebrates or invertebrates 'anthropo- morphically' in narratives of jealousy or hidden emotion is an interesting and open question; certainly organisms other than those used in the present study have been described as exhibiting jealousy (pigeons: Whitman, 1919) or hiding emotions (chickens: Gyger, Karakashian &amp; Marler, 1986). How- ever, depicting animals such as fish or insects in stories of jealousy or feigned interest such that their behaviors appear believably similar to those of humans or other mammals may be difficult (Hebb, 1946; cf Romanes, 1882, 1883). People might find the narrative itself unbelievable when a male cockroach or goldfish is described as stroking a female conspecific, and then staring at its appendage after another male conspecific takes over the stroking. Indeed, undergraduates found it much more 'reasonable' to attribute many psychological attributes to dogs than to fish (Rasmussen et al., 1993). Still, even if people failed to attribute psychological states to</page><page sequence="25">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 197 the cockroach or fish in such a narrative, this fact would not be evidence that when people make psychological attributions for other animals they do so by extrapolation from their own case. Critics might also argue (as did another anonymous reviewer) that al- though subjects characterized the animals in the narratives as having partic- ular emotions, they might not have actually believed that the animals really had those emotions. For example, a famous study by Heider &amp; Simmel (1944) showed that people made psychological attributions to geometric shapes which moved about on a film, although they did not believe that triangles can feel angry or squares depressed. However, people normally differentiate between cartoons and animals, and whereas they would not attribute actual psychological experiences to Walt Disney's Dumbo, they commonly attribute actual psychological experiences to real elephants. The psychological descriptions (e.g. feigning interest, hiding feelings) deemed appropriate to characterize chimpanzee behavior by de Waal (1982, 1986) were not always those used by naive readers to describe the chim- panzee, the human, or any of the other mammals. The data in Experiment 2 suggest that the interpretation of a chimpanzee or human as 'feigning in- terest' is perhaps too suggestive of a communicative or deceptive intent behind the gaze at his hand. The chimpanzee, human and other animals were interpreted as thinking while looking at their hand, paw or foot and (by females) as trying to hide their feelings. This interpretation suggests that, rather than the organism attempting to deceive the others about his psycho- logical state, he is instead directing his attention to thinking and (according to females) failing to show his upset feelings. From this perspective, the organism's looking at his hand, paw or foot is an incidental act, with no intention to communicate to others or even to be looking at what his eyes are directed at; the organism has simply directed his attention elsewhere ('inside') to his thoughts and feelings, and is unconcerned with what he gazes upon. If naive readers are correct, 'feigning interest' is an inaccurate psychological description of mammals in this circumstance; 'thinking' and perhaps 'hiding feelings' would be more accurate, and less suggestive of an attempt by the organism to manipulate others. Note, however, that the narrative used in the present study does not include some facts from de Waal's narrative, such as that the male who took over stroking the female was a dominant (and presumably much larger) male who pushed the other</page><page sequence="26">198 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM male away from the female. Perhaps, with the inclusion of these facts, subjects would more likely view looking at one's fingers when another male takes over the attentions of a female as a deceptive pretense. The data taken from naive readers offer a resolution of the anthropomor- phism debate in ethology and comparative psychology. Naive psycholog- ical interpretations of animals depend upon what animals do in particular contexts, such that the criteria for psychological terms can be satisfied if an animal performs a specific type of behavior in a specific context. The same criteria are used for people (about whom the psychological descriptions are presumed accurate) as for nonhumans (about whom they may or may not be accurate). Because naive interpreters view the criteria for psycholog- ical terms as satisfied by specific behavior-in-context, they feel no need to examine animals further to decide if they actually have the psycholog- ical experiences or abilities which often go with the use of psychological terms when these are applied toward people; they simply assume that the animals have similar experiences and abilities (Rollin, 1996). By contrast, scientists have been frequently faced with animal behavior which fits naive criteria, but which occurs in animal species which are deemed incapable of having the requisite psychological experiences or abilities (e.g. decep- tion in invertebrates -see Caldwell, 1986; Lloyd, 1986). Hence, many scientists view psychological attributions based on evidence of behavior in context as fallible, and attempt to avoid using them. To evaluate more fully whether animals have a particular psychological ability (e.g. intentional de- ception), scientists commonly create further criteria, reasonably requiring that an animal's behaviors indicate abilities (e.g. intentionality, communi- cation) from which the psychological ability could develop (e.g. Piaget, 1945/1981; Mitchell, 1986), and that the animal succeed in experiments designed to test for these abilities. But many scientists are like undergraduates in utilizing behavior-in- context for psychological evaluation, and argue persuasively that such behavior-in-context determines (de Waal, 1986; Byrne &amp; Whiten, 1988; Byrne, 1996) or is identical to (Thompson, 1986; see also Ryle, 1949) the animal's psychological characterization. Sometimes, however, these intepretations are not convincing (see Mitchell, 1988; 1996b). Unlike the undergraduates tested in the present study, however, some scientists</page><page sequence="27">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 199 use other factors, such as brain complexity or phylogeny, in addition to behavior-in-context to evaluate nonhuman psychology. These additional factors require examination. To argue that a spider cannot intentionally deceive, even though its behavior suggests that it can, because its brain, consisting of a few ganglia, is not complex enough seems reasonable (cf Griffin, 1992, for contrary arguments). Similarly, the in- clusion of an animal's phylogenetic closeness to humans as significant in psychologically reading the animal's behavior also seems reasonable. But this inclusion becomes problematic if one is searching for evidence that only organisms phylogenetically close to humans show social intelligence, yet dismisses or ignores behavioral evidence of social intelligence in or- ganisms not phylogenetically close to humans. To explore this problem, consider the following behavioral description: "A grizzly cub in Yellowstone Park found a big ham skin - a prized delicacy. Just as (he) was lifting it to his mouth a big bear appeared. He instantly dropped the ham skin, sat on it, and pretended to be greatly interested in watching something in the edge of the woods." (Mills, 1919/1976, p. 3) When this narrative, taken from a naturalist's observations, is presented to primatologists, they often discount it as unlikely. However, imagine the narrative with a chimpanzee as the protagonist (similar behaviors have been observed in chimpanzees): "A young chimpanzee at Gombe found some bananas - a prized delicacy. Just as he was lifting one to his mouth an adult chimp appeared. He instantly dropped the bananas, sat on them, and pre- tended to be greatly interested in watching something in the edge of the forest." This narrative, by contrast, suggests strongly to some primatologists that the animal was hiding the bananas, that the animal knew that if he sat on the bananas the older animal would not see them, and that the animal knew that his apparent interest in something on the horizon might dissuade the older animal from examining him too closely.3) Yet the bear and 3) Support for these differing interpretations comes from questioning primatologists and anthropologists by R.W. Mitchell and Warren Roberts.</page><page sequence="28">200 MITCHELL &amp; HAMM the chimpanzee exhibit the same behavior in the same context, and there is no evidence to indicate that bears are not capable of such intentional concealment. Indeed, according to many ethologists, bears exhibit many of the same behaviors taken as evidence of social intelligence in chimpanzees (see Burghardt, 1992; Mitchell, 1993, 1996b; compare Mills, 1919b/1976, 1922; and McNamee, 1982, p. 69; with Byre &amp; Whiten, 1990, p. 84-86). Whereas bears had been perceived by some turn-of-the-century Ameri- can naturalists as the most human of animals (e.g. Mills, 1922), the chim- panzee (or perhaps the bonobo) has become the most human of animals in the scientific imagination (see Miles, 1996). Unfortunately, each animal's changing 'symbolic identity' in scientific circles may or may not accu- rately reflect the animal's nature (Lawrence, 1990, p. 140). Primatologists reasonably expect chimpanzees - our phylogenetically close relatives - to exhibit a psychology similar to our own; bears, not being phylogeneti- cally close relatives, are considered unlikely to show a similar psychology, even when they provide behavioral evidence of a similar psychology. This interpretation may, indeed, be accurate. But, as scientists, we should be interested in using the same evidence (as much as possible) to evaluate animal species for their psychological abilities (Lehman, 1996), and we should also actively search for disconfirmatory evidence for our hypothe- ses, particularly when these hypotheses themselves strongly influence the interpretation of our data. Commonsense terminology is, as Hebb (1946) recognized, usefully and easily applied to chimpanzees as well as other mammalian species to char- acterize them psychologically (Rollin, 1989). However, scientists should not necessarily interpret the inevitable (because convenient) use of so- called anthropomorphic terminology as indicating identical psychological experiences or abilities in all animals so described. Clearly the same psy- chological term (e.g. deception) can be applied to behaviors in a variety of species which likely do not share an identical psychology (Morgan, 1894; Mitchell, 1986). Commonsense terminology should be and obviously has been used to determine which species might be appropriate for further experimental psychological evaluation. But commonsense psychological language only gives us a place to begin investigating our understanding of other species' psychology (de Waal, 1991; Burghardt, 1996). The problem for ethologists and psychologists is to devise developmental and exper-</page><page sequence="29">ANTHROPOMORPHISM OR BEHAVIOR READING? 201 imental criteria, applicable to diverse species, for psychological abilities and experiences. Devising such comparable tests of complex cognition has turned out to be much harder than it first appeared (Heyes, 1993); for a psychological state such as jealousy (or any other emotional experience), it is difficult to imagine creating experimental tests which are other than an examination of an animal's behavior in diverse contexts. It may be that for some psychological abilities and experiences behavior-in-context is the only evidence available for both humans and other animals. References Asquith, P. (1986).
