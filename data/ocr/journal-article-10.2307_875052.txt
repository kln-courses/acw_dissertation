<plain_text><page sequence="1">An addition to Antonio da Crevalcore BY FEDERICO ZERI AMONG the acquisitions made in recent years by the University Museum of Princeton in New Jersey is a painting on panel of medium size (77 by 58 cm.) which is given to Alvise Vivarini, representing St Francis of Assisi in a rather unusual role (Fig.53). The Saint is shown full face and standing, gazing towards the sky and displaying the stigmata; but neither the landscape, alternat- ing land and sea (thus scarcely featuring the territory of the Verna mountain) nor the double parapet of polychrome marbles, in the centre of which the figure is standing, makes it clear whether the picture indeed represents the scene of the stigmatization, as might be suggested by the expression of the figure. This doubt is emphasized also by the pathos, psychologically overcharged, with which the painter has represented the Saint of Assisi and which is especially conspicuous in the face and in the gesture of the hands, a gesture which seems to allude to that, of very ancient origin, common to the Redeemer of the Deasis, but absolutely uncommon in a secondary personage even if it is the Patron of the Poor. The panel is not new to art literature; it belonged recently to the collection ofJ. McFadden, junr. in New York City1 and before that to the collection of Alberto Pani in Paris and in Mexico City2 who, in the catalogue of his collection, informs us that the authorship of Alvise Vivarini was suggested by Lionello Venturi.3 In a recent monograph on the three Vivarinis the impossibility of claiming Alvise as the author of this curious image was recognized by its author, although his comment leaves us rather perplexed, since it is no less devious than the opinion that it sets out to refute. In fact, it accepts the presence of characteristics close to Alvise, proposing to shift the work towards another and un- specified personality in the orbit of Antonello da Messina.4 This unconvincing relationship was perhaps suggested to him by a superficial reading of the landscape in which all the details, near or far, are minutely described; or perhaps by the geometric shape of some passages, which is matched by the tendency towards realism in the physical features and in the expression of the Saint. A more searching scrutiny would not have failed to reveal that the characteristics of the background are extremely Ferrarese, at a moment when Francesco del Cossa and Ercole Roberti were the principal protagonists; this is very clear in the passages of the travellers and the walled city and, farther up, in the waters with the sailboats and the distant shores, beyond which mountains are lost on the horizon. Too weak to be referred to either of the two great painters, the St Francis in Princeton shows, however, some relation with a work in which both collaborated outside Ferrara, that is the Griffoni altar-piece, formerly in the Church of San Petronio in Bologna and now dismantled. In fact, although transformed, and infused with elements not exclusively Ferrarese the model of St Vincent Ferrer which was the centre of that altar- piece (now National Gallery, London) is apparently the one which was adopted for the figure of the St Francis. When we turn to other aspects of the panel, we discover that it does not strictly conform to Ferrarese painting proper, in the palette, in the sharp folds of the tunic (now not free from heavy retouching) and par- ticularly in the cold stillness of the figure which may give the impression of the embalming of the style, always lively and sprightly, of the painters of Ferrara. These few characteristics are sufficient to recognize in the author of the panel the rare and curious Antonio Leonelli, usually called Antonio da Crevalcore. His presence in Bologna in 1490 has been known for a long time, since the seventeenth century, thanks to a notice recorded by Masini;5 and it has been later reconfirmed by a document of 1494 found by Malaguzzi Valeri,6 implying that the Bolognese products of Cossa and Roberti must have been well known to him, as is evident in the Princeton panel. Here it is necessary to indicate the precise points of similarity with the signed work of Antonio da Crevalcore, the Holy Family of 1493, formerly in the Museum of Berlin and lost in the catastrophe of the Flakthurm in 1945. From the motif of the walls of neatly squared blocks of red and green porphyry and other rare stones to the facial type, characterized by the pronounced depression between the nose and the upper lip, everything is repeated with exact precision. Also repeated is the most typical aspect of the painter, his impassive and remote objectivity, applied equally to people and things, alive or in- animate, an objectivity he evidently derived from a genre in 1 Sale, Parke Bernet Galleries, New York, 11ith January 1956, lot 3. 2 Sale, Kende Galleries, Gimbel Bros., New York, 17th December 1942, lot I I. 3 A. j.

In this field Antonio da Crevalcore may perhaps some day yield some surprises, as sug- gested by the encomiastic references of his contemporaries Achillini and Casio and as foreshadowed also by some details of his rare catalogue, festoons of fruit, a candle, a bird, a book, all rendered in the same manner as the figures. Also in the Princeton panel, notwithstanding his strong emotional impact, the Saint remains no less still and rigid than the book which is open in the foreground; to repeat the words of S. Ortolani in connexion with another work of the artist, the celebrated Sacrati portrait in the Gallery of Munich, the Saint appears in a C6zanne-like stillness, 'comme une poire'.7 This characteristic of the painter is even more pronounced in a small panel which years ago I gave to Antonio, the St Catherine of Alexandria in the Berenson Collection (Fig.52). After long discus- sion the illustrious owner ended in agreeing on the correctness of my hypothesis;8 and if the very strong Morellian characteristics were not enough to uphold this, the impact of the strange image reinforces the conclusion reached on the basis of style. Thanks to the dark background and thanks to the subject, the mummifying power of the painter becomes most conspicuous; moreover, both the borrowings from Roberti in the ribbon and in the hair, and the over-emphatic expression converge to the same point so that the panel acquires a flavour, more or less unique in the fifteenth century, which from the macabre is transformed into the bizarre, as if it were a pardoxical still life of anthropomorphic type. It remains to see to what extent it is possible to devise a chronological sequence in the catalogue as it now stands of Antonio da Crevalcore, a task, however, which is made very problematic by the existence of only a single dated work. But once we reject the small portrait formerly in the Beer Collection in Budapest, published by Pigler, of whose authenticity one can but express strong doubts,9 it seems obvious that the latest work, much more advanced than 1493, is the Holy Family formerly in the Spiridon Collection and given to the artist by L. Coletti. In it the echoes of the Ferrarese Quattrocento are smoothed out and diluted, and although pictorially speaking it remains brilliant and individual, the tone is sugary and derivative with a close parallel to contemporary works by Panetti, Maineri, and Coltel- lini. The Spiridon panel belongs very likely to the first decade of the sixteenth century and in it the last echo of Ercole Roberti is to be seen in the Virgin's hands, but degraded by a superficial interpretation. There seems no doubt that to a moment earlier than I493 belong both the painting in Princeton and that in the Berenson Collection; that they must be placed in the Bolognese period of Antonio (already suggested by the recollections of the Griffoni altar-piece in the St Francis) is also indicated by the physiognomic type of the St Catherine, strongly recalling the repertoire in Roberti's frescoes formerly in San Pietro in Bologna. The admirable dramatic tension, so strong in Ercole's master- piece that it permeates even the miserable copies which alone remain, becomes here a simple fact of external mimicry, while the deeper stylistic meaning of the great model is completely lost. Moving backwards in time, I would suggest that the earliest item in the catalogue is the Sacrati portrait in the Gallery of Munich in which the culture seems to allude to a strictly Ferrarese education with no Emilian elements and closely related to the early period of Francesco del Cossa. This same early connexion of Antonio da Crevalcore with Ferrara makes it likely that he is the author of the famous portrait in the Correr Museum in Venice as already suggested by Bargellesi, who interpreted the initials A.F.P. as 'Antonious Ferrariensis Pinxit'.10 It is undeniable that the quality of this admirable portrait is much higher and more sustained than in the remaining works by Antonio da Crevalcore; but it is also true that in its archaism (indicating a date in the very early period of the painter) we meet again a whole series of stylistic and figurative elements, of such striking similarity to the re- mainder of his work that the possibility of pure chance is narrowed to the extreme. The architectural frame which encircles the image is conceived on the same model (very rare, if not unique in Ferrarese painting) which appears in the Munich canvas; and it is built up of the same selection of hard stones (red and green porphyry, jasper) which enriched the Sacrati portrait and the double balustrade in the Princeton panel. In the landscape the Venetian panel shows a generic relationship with Cossa and Roberti which is identical with the two landscape views on either side of the St Francis. The recession of planes, the types of the figures, of the trees, of the boats, of the buildings are practically identical. Not to mention, finally, the details of still life which are represented by the book with the ring and the pearl, placed on the parapet. 10 G. BARGELLESI, Rivista di Ferrara [May I934], pp.i iff.; and Notizie di Opere d'Arte Ferrarese [19541, PP.37 ff. I cannot accept the attribution to Crevalcore of the Male Portrait in the National Gallery in Washington as suggested by Bargellesi in the second of his writings and I do not share his doubts about the authenticity of the canvas in Munich, a work which is too subtle to be con- sidered a copy. Without quoting the numerous and most varied opinions which follow one another about the panel in Venice I must, however, note that its close relation with the picture in Munich was already observed by GRAFF in 1912 (Miinchner Jahrbuch, n, p.221). According to R. LONGHI: Officina Ferrarese [1934; 1956 edition], p.io6, n.o105, the background of the picture formerly in Berlin had been added or repainted; this appears very obvious also from photographs. The same author claimed that this addition or repainting had been executed in the workshop of Dosso Dossi, an opinion which, not having seen the picture, I cannot take for granted. 7 S.
