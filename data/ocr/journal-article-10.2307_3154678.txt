It is interesting to see the defenders of the traditional views of Scripture employ- ing the methods of the critics in their own behalf. This work which seeks to overthrow the critical analysis of the Hexateuch attempts to achieve its end by itself exercising destructive criticism upon the Massoretic text. Its main attack is in the direction of showing that the text of the Septuagint rests upon older recensions of the Hebrew than the Massoretic text. But the Septuagint yields many passages in which the divine names vary from the names employed in the Massoretic text. The conclusion drawn therefrom is that the Massoretic tradition does not correctly represent the original text, and, therefore, the critical analysis of the Hexateuch which rests largely upon the usage of the divine names has taken an unsafe guide and may not itself be accepted as trustworthy. Dahse has here offered the most complete survey of the textual evidence of the LXX upon this question that has thus far been compiled. But his conclusions do not by any means close the discussion. For it must be borne in mind that LXX criticism has only just begun; and the establishment of the original LXX text lies a long way in the future. When that has been found, it will still remain to be determined whether or not that original LXX (or its nearest possible approxima- tion) carried over into itself the divine names of its Hebrew source with literal exact- ness or with somewhat careless freedom. The strongly marked anti-anthropomorphic bias of LXX almost certainly militated against the reproduction of the name Yahweh even in its weaker equivalent Klptos, and favored the substitution of the more generic and comprehensive term 6 Oe6b. Any considerations brought forward now in support of the LXX text of the divine names, as over against the Massoretic text, must be regarded as inconclusive. In the same way, Dahse enters upon a study of the usage of the names Jacob and Israel in the LXX and arrives at the same conclusion, viz., that the LXX text differs so widely from the Massoretic in the use of these names that it is wholly unsafe and unscientific to use them as criteria of literary sources. Passing on from this task, Dahse ventures to offer an analytical theory of his own for the composition of Genesis. For he is himself convinced that there are after all differences of style and content in Genesis that demand explanation. The central thing in this new analysis is the traditional division of the text of the Pentateuch into convenient portions for reading in the synagogue services. These portions, or Sedarim, have been dovetailed together by editorial remarks and modifications added at their beginnings and endings and these editorial annotations are in the main the content of the so-called P document. In some cases, the Parasha has been treated in the same way. This scheme certainly does not lack novelty. But to mention only one of the least of its difficulties, it is indeed venturesome to base a scheme of source-analysis upon a set of phenomena which in part can be traced no farther back for verification than the Bomberg Bible. Dahse has not attempted to discover whether the Sedarim and Parashas as they now stand represent the original arrangement with accuracy or not. Not only so, but leaving that question aside, he furnishes no explanation of the fact of the variations of</page><page sequence="2">466 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY the Sedarim in the use of the divine names and other differentiating phenomena. The work as a whole, however, is praiseworthy as a sober, scientific attempt to get at facts, and it is the best piece of work yet put out in this field by the opponents of historical criticism.</page></plain_text>
