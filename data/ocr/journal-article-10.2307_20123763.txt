<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION DEWEY'S NATURALISM RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN JLt is rare that Dewey's naturalistig metaphysics, his compre hensive theory of experience and nature, is critically discussed. There is a widespread prejudice that Dewey was primarily a social and educational philosopher who had neither patience with nor interest in the speculative concerns of philosophy. Professor John E. Smith has shown that this is not so, that there is in Dewey a "full blown metaphysical scheme."1 He has expertly revealed some of Dewey's key insights while offering trenchant criticisms of Dewey's conception of experience and nature. But he has only partially opened the door to a more subtle, comprehensive Dewey with the result that a distorted picture of Dewey's position emerges. Professor Smith's sin is one of omission and when this is corrected many of his criticisms are either directly answered or at least mitigated. Instead of taking up Professor Smith's objections in a "piecemeal" fashion, I will turn directly to where I think his interpretation of Dewey is inaccurate and then consider his specific criticisms. Experience and Knowledge. "Experience" for Dewey is with out doubt the most fundamental and pervasive concept of his phi losophy. One may even characterize his entire philosophic endeavor as an attempt to reconstruct the philosophic use of "experience" in order to bring it into closer contact with the multifarious concrete experiences of men, and to escape the arti ficial and fruitless disputes of epistemologists. By analyzing five contrasts with what Dewey sometimes called "the traditional con cept of experience," Professor Smith has conveyed succinctly what this reconstruction involves. Experience consists of transactions 1 John E. Smith, "John Dewey: Philosopher of Experience." See this journal, XIII (September, 1959), p. 61. Hereafter referred to as Smith.</page><page sequence="2">DEWEY'S NATURALISM 341 of organism-environment which are more inclusive than knowing situations; experience is not primarily subjective, subject and object are distinctions instituted within experience; experience is active and not restricted to the specious present, it involves pro jection into the future; it does not consist of an aggregate of independent and disconnected elements, it contains genuine con nections within itself; and finally, experience is not opaque to reason, it can become funded with intelligence. What I find lacking in Professor Smith's discusi?n is a full appreciation of Dewey's theory of experiential situations which he called a "via media between extreme atomistic pluralism and block universe monisms." 2 A context or situation is neither a collection of isolated elements, nor a resting place in the march to the Abso lute. It has its own unity and individuality, though at the same time it shades off and is continuous with other experiences. It has both temporal and spatial dimensions, and all distinctions are ultimately made within and with reference to some inclusive situa tion. The task of a comprehensive theory of experience is to clarify and understand the generic and specific traits of the different modes of experience or situations, whether these are problematic, artistic, moral, religious, etc. The term "mode" is more appro priate than "type," for an experience may be pervaded by various qualities. Thus "religious" and "esthetic" do not refer to special types of experience which are radically divorced from other expe riences; they refer to distinctive qualities which can pervade and condition all experiences.3 Moral experiences may be religious, and intellectual and practical experiences may be esthetic. There is no doubt that when Dewey was forging his instru mentalism, it was the moment of conflict, the problem to be solved, which he emphasized. This gave rise to the impression that man is a restless creature preparing for a future that "never comes."4 But Dewey was sensitive to this criticism and in his later philosophy he deliberately sought to correct this distortion. 2 "Experience, Knowledge and Value: A Rejoinder," in The Philosophy of John Dewey, ed.

BERNSTEIN In almost all his major writings beginning with Experience and Nature in 1925, Dewey paid more careful attention to the con summatory phase of experience and to those experiences which are integrated and characterized by their qualitative coherence.5 Life is not a series of problems which are "taken by storm."6 There are consummations, fulfillments, experiences which are funded with meaning and are the source of what is most valuable for man. Professor Smith underplays this dimension of Dewey's analysis of experience. He tells us that there is no fulfillment in Dewey's view of man, but this is only true because Dewey con stantly points out that there are fulfillments. When we realize that experience consists of a plurality of overlapping and interpenetrating situations, each of which is an affair or history, we are in a position to evaluate Professor Smith's remarks concerning Dewey's theory of knowledge. Professor Smith writes, "Knowledge is never had, but is always infinitely postponed; what we can have in the present is an hypothesis or theory the meaning and justification of which always lies in the future."7 During Dewey's lifetime a similar objection had been raised which he attempted explicitly to answer.8 Knowledge for Dewey is the cumulative end-product of inquiries; it is that which is warranted through inquiry. Dewey does insist that all knowledge is hypothetical in the sense that future inquiries may necessitate a revision or abandonment of what is now taken as justified. It does not follow, however, that knowledge is "always infinitely postponed." This criticism pre supposes the very idealist conception of knowledge which Dewey reacted against and opposed, i.e., knowledge is only that which can be ultimately and absolutely justified. (It is ironical that the objection about the infinite postponement of knowledge which has been made by idealists against Dewey has more relevance to the 5 Cf.

Dewey never tired of pointing out that in both common sense and scientific inquiry, the knowledge gained is always sub ject to further criticism and possible revision, yet no one would take this as evidence that we never possess knowledge. On the contrary, if it were claimed that a theory could not possibly be refuted by any further inquiry, we would call it dogma rather than justified knowledge. When Professor Smith tells us that for Dewey knowledge is never had as "distinct from the having of 'an experience of know ing' "9 there is a context in which this is true and one in which it is definitely false. Knowledge is had or directly enjoyed and used as the product of inquiries. It can enhance our immediate direct experiences and can be used to gain intellectual and practical con trol. But this immediate use and enjoyment of knowledge does not mean that we justify knowledge simply by direct grasp. All knowledge is mediated insofar as it involves an inferential step which goes beyond what is immediately present, and it is validated through the ongoing process of inquiry. When Dewey argues that knowledge is not had, it is in the context of showing that there is no immediate knowledge which can be justified in the mere having of it.10 However, he certainly believed that the knowledge achieved through inquiry can be directly enjoyed and possessed. As he wrote in answer to Hocking ". . . the final test of the value of 'contents of judgment' now attained is found not in their rela tion to the content of some final judgment, to be reached at the close of an infinite progression, but in what is done in the living present, what is done in giving enriched meaning to other things and in increasing our control over them." n Discussion of a general theory of the modes of experience turns our attention to, if not a contradiction, at least a seeming incompatibility in Professor Smith's presentation. He tells us that Dewey "belongs with the great comprehensive thinkers of 9 Smith, p. 72. 10 Cf. ch. 8, "Immediate Knowledge: Understanding and Inference." in Logic: The Theory of Inquiry. 11 "Nature in Experience," op. cit., p. 257.</page><page sequence="5">344 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN the past," 12 and speaks of his "large-minded approach to genuinely philosophic questions,"13 and yet he claims that according to Dewey "attention and energy should be directed to the specific alone," u an approach which he labels "the dominance of the focal point." ls But we are not told how the prescription to be specific and the concern with comprehensiveness and generality are to be reconciled. Yet the compatibility and the interdependence of the specific and the general is one of the distinctive features of Dewey's philosophy. As early as the Studies in Logical Theory (1903), Dewey attacked a "wholesale" approach to philosophic issues which attempts to deal with questions like "the relation of thought as such to reality as such." 16 He criticized ultimate questions like this one, not because there are more pressing practical questions to be answered, but because of the intellectual futility of these questions. Nevertheless, unlike many philosophic analysts who are sympathetic with such an attack, Dewey certainly believed that philosophy must be concerned with the general. His point is that if we want to develop a general theory of inquiry, it is hopeless to think that this can be accomplished by a dialectical manipulation of terms like "thought" and "reality" which are isolated from any context. When Professor Smith criticizes Dewey for "acknow ledging only specific problems and the instrumental response" 17 he neglects Dewey's point that the only way to arrive at a general theory of inquiry is by observing what are the traits of specific inquiries which result m warranted judgments. The Aristotelian 12 Smith, p. 60. 13 Ibid., p. 61. 14 Ibid., p. 62. 15 Ibid., p. 62. 16 Reprinted in Essays in Experimental Logic (Dover Publications) p. 81. 17 Smith, p. 74. Concerning the relation of the general and the specific, Dewey wrote: "Generalization of the nature of the reflective process certainly involves elimination of much of the specific material and contents of the thought-situations of daily life and critical science. Quite compatible with this, however, is the notion that it seizes upon certain specific conditions and factors, and aims to bring them to clear consciousness?not to abolish them." Studies in Logical Theory, op. cit., p. 83.</page><page sequence="6">DEWEY'S NATURALISM 345 strain of deriving the generic from a careful examination of specif ic cases is central to all of Dewey's philosophy. Professor Smith suggests that Dewey's suspicion of "ulti mate" questions is evidence of a failure to be concerned with basic and general issues. If "ultimate" is understood as that which is divorced from all experiential contexts, then Dewey does indeed argue, as Kant did, that this leads to an endless dialectical juggling of concepts. But if by "ultimate" we mean that which is basic to all experience, then such issues must be confronted. When Professor Smith actually mentions some of the ultimate issues which he accuses Dewey of ignoring, the strik ing fact is that Dewey did struggle with these issues, or more accurately with the presuppositions involved in raising these issues. By examining Dewey's treatment of one of the "ultimate" questions enumerated by Professor Smith, we can gain an insight into Dewey's typical mode of attack and at the same time clear up a number of confusions concerning his naturalism. Experience and Nature. Professor Smith asks "whether human purpose and choice are but the inner appearance of a supposedly real world composed only of physical events." " This question would never arise unless a dichotomy were presupposed between a real world composed of physical events and a realm of appearance which is a catch all for everything non-physical. This dualism between the physical and the non-physical which has been implicit in a good deal of modern philosophy must be examined if we are to assess the plausibility of the original question. Dewey argues that dualism is in fact the result of a hypostatization of an important functional distinction. "Physical event" when used as a technical term is a refined product of inquiry, a discrimination deliberately instituted for the purpose of furthering our scientific understanding of nature. "Physical event" does not name an onto logically independent entity. It names an abstraction from our complex experience. Progress in science depends upon temporarily ignoring some of the more apparent and insistent qualities of expe rience, but this is not a sufficient reason to condemn these qualities to unreality. To take the refined products of scientific inquiry as 18 Smith, p. 74.</page><page sequence="7">346 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN the exclusively real is a mistake. There are contexts in which aspects of experience and nature which are justifiably neglected in scientific inquiry are of the utmost value.19 It has been a classic error of modern philosophy, Dewey argued, to mis-take some distinction which is important for certain specific purposes and hypostatize it into an ontological or epistemological dualism.20 The relevance of this to the original question should be clear. There is no competition between "physical events" and "human purpose and choice" for the title of reality: the split between a realm of physical events and a realm of appearance is unjustified. If Dewey left the question here, he might be justifiably accused of evading the point of the question. But Dewey does give a naturalistic account of human choice and purpose in which he shows that choice is continuous with the selective behavior exhibited by everything that exists though it is not completely reducible to this selective behavior. Human choice is unique because of man's ability to anticipate and to envision ends-in-view. "In so far as a variable life-history and intelligent insight and fore sight enter into it, choice signifies a capacity for deliberately chang ing preferences."21 Dewey's analysis of the original question proceeds in two parts: first, he roots out the unjustifiable dualism which is implicit in this complex question; secondly, he offers a naturalistic account of choice in which he shows how it is botli continuous and distinctive from other natural behavior. 19 For a fuller discussion of this and related points see my lecture "Knowledge, Value and Freedom" in John Dewey: Philosophy and the Experimental Spirit; and my Introduction to Experience, Nature and Freedom. Both will be published by the Liberal Arts Press. 20 This suggests another reason why Professor Smith's expression "the dominance of the focal point" is misleading. It is a cardinal principle of Dewey's contextualism that "surrounding, bathing, saturating the things of which we are directly aware is some inclusive situation which does not enter into the direct material of reflection." It is precisely the domi nance of the focal point which has led philosophers to neglect the con textual background that conditions all thought?"the greatest single disaster which philosophic thinking can incur." Cf. "Context and Thought," The University of California Publications in Philosophy, v. 12, pp. 203-224. 21 "Philosophies of Freedom" in Philosophy and Civilization (New York: Minton, Balch &amp; Co.), p. 276. See this article for a more extensive analysis of choice and freedom.</page><page sequence="8">DEWEY'S NATURALISM 347 This brief discussion of choice opens the issue of Dewey's non reductive naturalism. Professor Smith writes at one point that "nature turns out to be a most human affair" 22 and at another "man is so completely a part of nature that it often seems as though there were no second party."23 Both these claims are true, but when the conception of experience and nature which underlies them is made explicit, their polemical edge is blunted. "Nature" for Dewey designates various levels of transaction which may be dis criminated by their different patterns of behavior and the unique qualities which they manifest. Human experience is one type or level of transaction which is both in nature and of nature. It is in nature in the sense that it is itself a type of natural transaction which is conditioned by other natural transactions. It is of nature insofar as natural entities enter into experiential transactions; we have experience of nature, not merely of other experiences. What distinguishes Dewey's naturalism from earlier nineteenth century mechanistic materialisms is his sensitivity to the different qualities and traits exhibited by different transactions, and his suspicion of reductionism. Nature, he claimed, has mechanism, but is not itself a mechanism. Different types of transactions cannot be explained away in terms of less complex transactions; they demand new categories of explanation. Thus for example, Dewey claimed that the social is a fundamental philosophic category because social phenomena manifest something distinctive which cannot be explained in terms of the "physical" or the "psycho physical"; on the contrary, physical and psycho-physical phenom ena take on a new significance in social transactions.24 Nature, then, is a human affair insofar as it includes experience as a natural transaction which is continuous with though not identical with less complex transactions. The "level" metaphor may be misleading, for experience "is no infinitesimally thin layer or foreground of nature, but . . . penetrates into it, reaching down into its depths ... it tunnels in all directions and in so doing brings 22 Smith, p. 63. 23 Ibid., p. 72. 24 ?? "The Social as a Category" reprinted as "The Inclusive Philo sophic Idea" in Philosophy and Civilization, pp. 77-92.</page><page sequence="9">348 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN to the surface things at first hidden. . . ." 25 To speak of nature as a "second party" is confusing because it echoes the dualism which Dewey rejects. Man does not stand over and against nature. All conflicts are within the plurality of natural transactions. Pro fessor Smith claims that Dewey's pluralism, which he calls a "radical pluralism,"26 is untenable as a metaphysical principle "because it can never get beyond repeating in the form of what purports to be a critical conclusion the fact known to all at the outset, namely that reality contains as many things as it does in fact contain."27 This is Professor Smith's most serious charge. It is not only at the heart of his specific criticisms; if it were true it would mean that Dewey's metaphysics is little more than a set of uninteresting truisms. To answer this charge squarely, we must briefly examine Dewey's conception of metaphysics and method. Metaphysics and Method. Though at times, Professor Smith appears to accuse Dewey of a gratuitous anthropomorphism, when Dewey argues for a clear discrimination between a generic descrip tion of what is and a critique of values, it is the neutrality of Dewey's metaphysics which is criticized. Dewey's insight needs to be clearly recognized, that many traditional metaphysical sys tems have been distorted by a projection of moral values which results in a confusion of morals and metaphysics. "Philosophy often exhibits a cataleptic rigidity in attachment to that phase of the total objects of experience which has become especially dear to a philosopher. It is real at all hazards and only it; other things are real only in some secondary and Pickwickian sense." 28 There are traces of this attachment in Plato's eulogy of the forms, Berg son's affinity to duration, as well as the assignment of special status to protocol sentences by the logical atomists. Dewey argues, and I think rightly, that this frequently harbors a basic confusion. If we set out to describe the generic traits of existence, 25 Experience and Nature, Second edition (reprinted by Dover Publica tions), p. 3a. 26 Smith, p. 77. 27 Ibid., p. 77. 28 Experience and Nature, p. 25.</page><page sequence="10">DEWEY'S NATURALISM 349 then we must not illicitly import our cherished values so as to distort the description.29 Ultimately, as Professor Smith notes, metaphysics is not neutral to morals, for an intelligent critique of values presupposes an accurate understanding of their relation to the traits of existence. Nor does this view of metaphysics mean that all "selective preference must be overcome."30 In criticism, Professor Smith writes, "without a differential standpoint or inter pretative principle . . . from which we attempt to understand reality in its wholeness, we have no insight and ultimately no philos ophy."31 But Dewey himself wrote, "Selective emphasis, with its accompanying omission and rejection, is the heart-beat of mental life. To object to the operation is to discard all thinking." 32 Dewey not only acknowledges, he emphasizes that all thinking involves "selective interest" for even "to be 'objective' in thinking is to have a certain sort of selective interest operative."33 We cannot escape the situation of selective choice for a privileged position of omni science. But by becoming self-conscious of this subjective element in all thinking, we can avoid the pitfall of neglecting the specific purposes which govern our choice, and we can deliberately select those perspectives which will lead to the richest and best warranted judgments. In this connection we can also see the ambiguity of Professor Smith's comments concerning the pragmatic view of method. We are told that "to suppose that one-sidedness and special pleading attaches only to results and conclusions and not to methods has been one of the most cherished fancies of the entire pragmatic tradi tion."34 I would have supposed that the pragmatic movement would be unintelligible unless it is understood as "special pleading" for the adoption of the analogue of scientific method in philosophy. The landmark of the pragmatic movement, Peirce's essay "The 29 A similar classification of metaphysical systems is given by P. F. Strawson. Individuals: An Essay in Descriptive Metaphysics (Methuen &amp; Co., 1959) who distinguishes descriptive and revisionary strands in meta physics. 30 Smith, p. 76. 81 Ibid., p. 77. 32 Experience and Nature, p. 25. 33 "Context and Thought," op. cit., p. 216. 34 Smith, p. 68.</page><page sequence="11">350 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN Fixation of Belief," explicitly describes a number of methods which have been used for settling belief and argues for the use of scientific method in philosophy. But we do not have to turn to Peirce for evidence. The first chapter of Experience and Nature, "Experience and Philosophic Method," is an explanation and defense of empir ical or denotative method in philosophy. Such a method is cer tainly not neutral for Dewey and the pragmatists insofar as it can be contrasted with other philosophic methods for fixing belief. And it is because there is so much resistance to employing such a method in philosophic discussions that a large part of the prag matists' polemic has been taken up with arguing for its use. The pragmatists insisted that philosophic method ought to be neutral in the sense that it should be self-corrective, opening inquiry from all blocks, and subject to revision in the light of further experience. Turning from these methodological problems to the sub stantive issues of Dewey's metaphysics, we must take a look at Dewey's theory of quality if we are to understand his pluralism. Dewey's theory of quality, which has more in common with Peirce's description of Firstness than with traditional discussions of primary and secondary qualities, is one of the most interesting and basic features of his metaphysics. Quality, or what Dewey sometimes calls "esthetic quality," is a generic trait of existence. Qualities per se are neither subjective nor objective, inside an organism nor outside it; they are the resultants or termini of natu ral transaction. They are directly experienced or had. The aspect of Dewey's theory of quality which is especially relevant to his pluralism is his discussion of tertiary qualities which pervade and unify the diverse elements of a situation. Earlier we spoke of the situation or context as something which is more than a collection of discrete elements and less than the Absolute. This, however, is only to characterize a situation negatively. It is a pervasive quality which conditions and is conditioned by all the elements of a situation that unifies the context and makes it into a single whole. And in a developing situation, whether it is problematic, artistic, or moral, the underlying quality exerts a regulative influ ence on the direction of its development. While we speak of an experience as an affair or history which has its own unity and uniqueness, this does not entail the consequence that an experience</page><page sequence="12">DEWEY'S NATURALISM 351 is cut off from other experiences?the fallacy of monadism. Every experience is continuous with other experiences; it is funded with the consequences of past experiences and is pregnant with pos sibilities for future experiences. Nor does it follow that because an experience has connections with other experiences it loses its indi viduality in an all-encompasing Absolute?the fallacy of monism. Dewey then is not the "radical pluralist" described by Pro fessor Smith: he repudiates such an extreme pluralism. His pluralism of interpenetrating histories is formulated to take advantage of the insights of the particularists who have been sensitive to the uniqueness and individuality of experiences and the idealists who have appreciated the developing and integral features of experience. When Russell claimed that Dewey's view of expe rience leads directly to a Hegelian variety of absolutism, Dewey remarked that "the pluralistic and individualized character of situa tions is stated over and over again, and is stated in direct connec tion with the principle of experiential continuum." 35 Before concluding, there is one more criticism which we must consider. It is a recurring motif of Professor Smith's critique that Dewey in his concern with the public and the social aspects of experience lost sight of the subject and the individual. I agree with Professor Smith that Dewey frequently disregarded the knotty problems which cluster about the concept of individuality. In part this is explainable when we realize that Dewey reacted against the neglect of the tremendous formative influence of the social environment on the character of the individual. Dewey however, insisted that individual-social is a reciprocal distinction, and one can detect in his later philosophy an increasing concern with the problems of individuality. In the little known and remarkably speculative article "Time and Individuality" 36 Dewey grappled with the metaphysical issues of individuality. He there attempted to avoid the disjunction that either the persistence of the individual is an illusion, because the individual is nothing but a series of fleeting autonomous percep 35 "Experience, Knowledge and Value: A Rejoinder," op. cit., p. 545. 36 Time and Its Mysteries, Series II (New York University Press), 1940, pp. 85-109.</page><page sequence="13">352 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN tions, or that change and development are illusions because the individual is nothing but an arrangement of eternal entities. Here too the problem is to account for continuity and uniqueness. A human individual is a unique history or career, "an extensive event; or, if you prefer, it is a course of events each of which takes into itself something of what went before and leads on to that which comes after." 37 Illustrating his meaning with reference to a specif ic individual, Dewey writes: The career which is his unique individuality is the series of inter actions in which he was created to be what he was by the ways in which he responded to the occasions with which he was presented. One cannot leave out either conditions as opportunities nor yet unique ways of responding to them.38 An individual can lose his individuality, he can "become im prisoned in routine and fall to the level of mechanism." But individuals can be creative and the source of novelties. We see here the reciprocal character of the individual and the social: the quality of one is dependent on the other. And one may justly say that Dewey's preoccupation with the social is because of his end in-view of encouraging the type of individuality which is genuinely creative and pregnant with new developments. I would like to conclude with a few polemical remarks. I have been concerned to show that Dewey's theory of experience and nature is more complex and subtle than is even suggested by Professor Smith's penetrating discussion. I do not mean to sug gest that Dewey is immune to criticism, or that answers will always be found in his writings to the many difficult questions which critics raise. Dewey's theory of experience and nature is tangled and sprawling. One wishes that he might have followed out his speculations with greater care, rigor and consistency. Professor Smith makes it abundantly clear that Dewey's natu ralistic empiricism is far more inclusive and humane than other varieties of empiricism. He suggests that if we want to accomplish what Dewey intended, i.e., account for the concrete and diverse experiences of men, we must pass beyond even Dewey's liberalized 37 Ibid., p. 91. 38 Ibid., p. 104.</page><page sequence="14">DEWEY'S NATURALISM 353 naturalism to a theological perspective. Dewey realized, as I think philosophers are again coming to realize, that there is much more to experience than exists in abstractions of competing epistemologies. The philosopher's task is to take experience in all its complexity and intricacy and elucidate it. The philosopher must be concerned with the moral, political and even religious problems of men. Dewey believed that this could be done without appealing to a transcendent being, and in liberal cooperation with the experimental sciences. Yale University.</page></plain_text>
