<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESPONSE TO THREE COMMENTS ON JEW AND PHILOSOPHER Kenneth Hart Green Jew and Philosopher: The Return to Maimonides in the Jewish Thought of Leo Strauss is the first book to deal with Leo Strauss both as a Jewish thinker, and as rediscoverer of Maimonides. The author responds to comments on his book by three scholars: Martin D. Yaffe, Michael Wyschogrod, and Laurence Berns. This response focuses on what he regards as the formidable challenge which Leo Strauss as a Jewish philoso pher represents for the future of Jewish thought, and on whether these scholars face that challenge adequately. In response to Yaffe, Green deals with the contemporary relevance of Strauss's thought; it is argued that this relevance is only enhanced by the moribund state of current philosophy, and by the divergent forms of present-day thought which give a vehement defense of Judaism but do not take seriously the Maimonidean legacy. In response to Wyschogrod, Green defends the tradition of Jewish philosophy descended from Maimonides as an authentic Jewish tradition, rooted in adherence to the deeper meaning of Judaism, and to an awareness of the original meaning of philosophy. In response to Berns, Green deals with the problem of radical historicism and the notion of nature as a standard in Strauss's thought, and considers how much the stages of development in Strauss's thought affected his critique of radical historicism. I am honored by the three distinguished scholars who have given such careful consideration to my book Jew and Philosopher.1 I take Jewish Political Studies Review 9:3-4 (Fall 1997) 99</page><page sequence="2">100 Kenneth Hart Green their comments most seriously, and will try to render an adequate account of myself in response to them. I believe that this discussion shows just how formidable is the challenge which the thought of Leo Strauss represents. Whether or not one is persuaded by it, it is a challenge which cannot be ignored, neither by future Jewish thought nor by future philosophy. Indeed, I would venture to predict that this is a challenge which will only grow sharper in the future. I will begin with Martin Yaffe's "Remarks." As the host and organizer of the American Academy of Religion conference session from which these papers originally derive, Yaffe conceals a careful analysis beneath the cover of a gracious introduction. He focuses on three common complaints recurrently lodged against Leo Strauss as a modern Jewish thinker, by critics who regard his thought as enmeshed in what seem to them unresolved dilemmas and fatal contradictions. Permit me to restate in my own terms the three complaints and Yaffe's three responses to them. I will add several comments and considerations of my own, and raise some related questions, highlighting both what I think is most significant about these complaints, as well as what is most problematic about them. First, do Strauss and Maimonides, by their resort to the ancient Greek books devoted to 'Tove of wisdom," not imply a subordina tion of Judaism to Greek philosophy, if not a fundamental breach with classical Jewish faith and teaching? Second, is Strauss not irrelevant ? or perhaps even a threat ? to the continued flourishing of the Jews and Judaism in the late twen tieth and early twenty-first centuries, that in this supposedly "postmodern" era depends on a moral, religious, and political embrace of a decided relativism? Third, can the ancient philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, and the medieval philosophy following in the same tradition while trans forming it, such as Maimonides, Averroes, and Aquinas (what Strauss calls the philosophic "great tradition" which he was single mindedly engaged in attempting to recover), can it ever be made compatible with the principles of modern Judaism? In other words, are these premodern thinkers not irrelevant or obsolete at best, morally regressive at worst, since the modern philosophy on which modern Judaism depends is surely built on the rejection of these premodern thinkers? Yaffe's "Remarks" state these charges fairly; he also argues ably and well how Strauss might defend himself against them. I think he also represents rightly what I claim of Strauss. However, I would like to further elaborate my own views in slightly different terms. Since in Yaffe's response to the charges, he proceeds in an order</page><page sequence="3">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 101 which is not the same as the order in which the charges were originally laid by him, I will follow his order of response. (3) The charges about irrelevance or regressiveness are laid by certain modern Jewish critics of Strauss who are not fundamentally opposed to philosophy, who are also not relativists, and who remain firmly grounded in modern Judaism. According to them, the modern philosophic thinkers would be better guides for a modern Judaism searching for an escape from its contemporary dilemmas, i.e., such modern philosophic thinkers as Spinoza, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, or Dewey, which these critics are usually the contemporary advocates of in Jewish philosophy. Their critique presupposes two hidden but doubtable assumptions: (1) the superiority of modern philosophy to all premodern philosophy, ancient and medieval, which they believe we have been able to progress beyond; and (2) the rejection of any fundamental crisis in modernity, which they do not believe twentieth-century history and thought forces us to face. To those critics, the modern philosophers are believed to be entirely compatible with Judaism, while to adhere to, or even to learn from and attempt to recover, the ancient-medieval philosophic thought of Plato and Aristotle is somehow to be compelled to renounce Judaism spiritually, since it is not possible to be a genuine modern Jew and a philosopher of that retrograde type. In this view (whose approach to Strauss resembles complaint number one, but is employed for different reasons), Maimonides the Jewish philoso pher is treated as mostly a false Jew, in the sense of "false conscious ness." And this is asserted to be so with even greater force and certainty if Strauss's idea is that Maimonides' fundamental teach ings are believed to be somehow useful for modern purposes. However, in the case of Maimonides himself, his errors as a medieval Jewish thinker are usually forgiven and accepted historically by such modern critics, as the legitimate and unavoidable products of the medieval culture which shaped and determined him. (Strauss's "errors" as a modern Jewish thinker are usually not excused quite so indulgently.) For such critics, if they are consistent, they would also have to dismiss or severely qualify Maimonides' enormous efforts on behalf of Jewish law, from the modern spiritual point of view, since this work (Mishneh Torah) was moved by a surpassed, regres sive, or merely self-deceived spirit of medieval Judaism. These Jewish philosophic critics of Maimonides and Strauss obviously consider themselves competent judges of what is authentically Jew ish from the spiritual point of view, which for them assumes as virtually self-evident that the modern spirit is the most naturally harmonized with the Jewish spirit.</page><page sequence="4">102 Kenneth Hart Green As a result, Strauss is often differentiated derogatorily from other contemporary Jewish thinkers for one of the following reasons: either he is relegated to the status of essentially and only a philoso pher; or he just happened by accident to be a Jew, which bears perhaps some accidental, but not any essential, relation to his thought; or he is perhaps a Jewish thinker of some sort, but not as "authentically" a Jewish thinker as compared with those on the preferred list; or he merely chanced on a fifty-year study, with the greatest care, of Maimonides' Guide and his other works for purely personal reasons, and his rediscovery of its hidden depths is of little specifically Jewish relevance, since its impulses and imperatives derive from a foreign as well as past culture which once dominated the Jewish mind, and which Strauss borrowed for his own "eccen tric" reasons as an "engag6" ideologist; or he merely considered it prudent or useful for some perhaps political reason to remain loyal to Judaism as a moral and religious tradition; or he is grudgingly conceded to be an authentic Jewish thinker, drawing on an authen tically Jewish source, but the influence he exercised is entirely deleterious or has a mainly bad effect, because the source (Maimonides) and its current representative (Strauss) is either not good for modern Judaism religiously, by directing it toward some form of orthodox traditionalism, or is not good for modern Jews politically, by directing them toward some form of moral neo conservatism. These responses to Strauss seem unable to carry through a dispassionate examination of Strauss's philosophic intentions as a modern Jewish thinker, who returned for modern reasons and as a modern thinker, to the medieval Maimonides, and through him to the ancient Plato. For Strauss as for Maimonides, to recur to Plato is not to reject Moses, because the Hebrew Bible and Platonic philoso phy are both regarded as most essential and needful, by Strauss as well as by Maimonides, in the matter of the truth. Strauss is not just a philosopher who happened accidentally to be a Jew, and he does not merely consider it prudent or useful for some reason to remain loyal to his Judaism. Rather, besides his own personal commitment, faith, or just loyalty as a Jew, he views Judaism especially as a matter of the utmost importance in all investigation of the truth, based as this must be for us on the historical legacy of Western civilization, of which Western religion and Western philosophy are perhaps the highest expressions. According to Strauss, it is modern Western man ? concerned to save the best elements of Western civilization in modernity, which has been made sick by its own medicine ? who is himself driven to reconsider the roots of modernity and of the West in these very premodern thinkers. Western man, if he is honest,</page><page sequence="5">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 103 wants to know whether these roots might still be healthy so that we might hope, through the nurture or cure of these roots, to restore and preserve the mature but rapidly ailing plant of Western civilization in modernity. Whatever considerations we may arrive at in the search for the philosophic truth about Plato and about Maimonides, and about the philosophic truth according to Plato and according to Maimonides, still we cannot just embrace or swallow their teachings as a prescrip tion for modern ills, which Strauss is surely not asking. (As if such were possible for any philosophic teaching as philosophy, which never just embraces or swallows.) Of course, this is of even greater importance for Strauss in the case of Plato ? that we cannot just embrace or swallow his philosophic teaching ? because as a writer of philosophic dialogues, it is not so clear that we know what this teaching is. We would quickly discover similar difficulties (just as we would do with Plato and Maimonides) in trying to grasp imme diately, and to appropriate for use, the true teaching of the Hebrew Bible. This is because we are not able to presume that we possess and can continue its teaching pure and simple through unbroken tradi tion, since modern biblical criticism may have been led to obscure its true teaching, and our recent traditional defenses against such criticism may have been driven to blur its original teaching even further. Likewise the crisis of modernity, in which our contempo rary search for truth is enmeshed, is so radical a crisis as to certainly put us in a much greater state of doubt about our own modern philosophic thought, concerning what its true meaning is, what its origins were, and to what it is an alternative, if better or worse. For Strauss, this crisis is so fundamental, it represents such a crushing attack on all tradition, that we cannot assume we know what we once thought we knew even through modern tradition about the very simplest and most obvious roots of modern man and the modern world. Strauss accepts what is perhaps the penultimate argument of Hermann Cohen: the two highest elements or constituents of West ern civilization are the Hebrew Bible and Plato. But from this Cohen was also led to argue, in a defense of modernity, that ultimately these two highest elements or constituents had been synthesized, Hegelian style, by Immanuel Kant in his climactic modern philosophy. This claim, Strauss began to see in light of twentieth-century history, could not be sustained. Cohen's synthesis, established in the name of historical progress, is a noble hope ? but it does not accord with the historical actuality on whose ground he claimed to base himself. Strauss views the two separate constituents as never yet persua</page><page sequence="6">104 Kenneth Hart Green sively reduced either to one another, or synthesized through some third and higher thing like History. Strauss believes we must reconsider separately the two highest elements of Western civilization, the Hebrew Bible and Plato, which remain separate and as yet unsynthesized ? although not so sepa rate as to allow us to miss the common ground which they may share, on which the claim to synthesis had been based. The Hebrew Bible represents to Strauss the root of modern Western religion and morality ? the divine passion for justice or righteousness, and the divine mystery of the most high Being who is infinite ? whose faith is for him as a Jew best comprehended by Judaism, and which as a faith in the one exclusive God still makes the highest, fully legitimate demands on us. And Strauss traces the roots of modern Western philosophy and science to Plato, who represents best to him philoso phy not just at its ancient peak, as the unyielding desire for knowl edge acquired and wisdom possessed, but philosophy as a way of life, as search and longing, as an unfulfilled human possibility. In other words, for Plato philosophy is perhaps the only activity consistent in human terms with the peculiar duality of man: igno rance of the most important things which we naturally desire to relieve, together with some dim awareness of the most important things we desire to know in their full light. Or we also might put the same duality as follows: seemingly complete self-awareness of our selves as a whole, and yet somehow also an awareness of ourselves as a mere part of a larger whole which leads to our never completed desire for a full awareness of the whole through an awareness of all its parts and how they fit in the whole. In order to decide if the Hebrew Bible and Plato are compatible or irreconcilable, we must await until we approach or get closer to a fresh comprehension of the true and original meaning of each antagonist. And yet what the modern thinkers thought about Plato and the Hebrew Bible is and remains our first legacy, with which we must begin, and only from which can we proceed to whatever we may wish to learn further. Hence, in Strauss's mind, the modern is scarcely dispensed with: for modern man it is his only true point of departure. Neither should its study be neglected, nor its important claims be diminished. But its highest claim ? to historically synthesize and still preserve the constituent elements of Western civilization in their full integrity, based on unqualified progress ? is no longer defensible. In other words, this grave modern crisis that we face does offer us one great advantage: of restarting the ancient and vitalizing Western debate between the two original contenders or fundamental antagonists for the human soul. We certainly cannot assume that the deepest issues (their "compatibility" of mind versus their disso</page><page sequence="7">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 105 nance in cognitive essence) have been settled by the modern resolu tions rendered doubtful by this crisis. Hence, our reflections on these issues, impelled by the urgent imperative of the desire of modern Western civilization to survive against its contemporary opponents from within and without, may acquire a freshness and perhaps even a depth lacking in these debates for centuries. Or as Strauss put it: Philosophy and the Bible are the alternatives or the antagonists in the drama of the human soul. Each of the two antagonists claims to know or to hold the truth, the decisive truth, the truth regarding the right way of life. But there can be only one truth: hence, conflict between these claims and necessarily conflict among thinking beings; and that means inevitably argument. Each of the two opponents has tried since millennia to refute the other. This effort is continuing in our day, and in fact it is taking on a new intensity after some decades of indifference.2 (1) These charges against Strauss, concerning his supposed breach with Judaism, are occasionally laid by orthodox Jews, although his allegiance to Maimonides and his frequent arguments in favor of an enlightened religious orthodoxy linked to political Zionism as, at the very least, the most authentic form of modern Judaism, and the standard against which other forms should measure themselves, tend to make them sympathetic to him. Such charges are made against Strauss with perhaps even greater frequency by those known as ultraorthodox Jews, but by no means only made by them, who suspect his defense of reason and with it of Western philosophy and science, both modern and premodern. To be sure, most of Maimonides' medieval and modern ultraorthodox Jewish critics attacked him on similar grounds. Why do I say the attack against Strauss for his defense of reason, of Western philosophy and science, is by no means only made by ultraorthodox religious Jews? This type of attack is also often made against Strauss by adherents of recent trends in modern thought, usually called "postmodernism," who regard the very idea of a resuscitation of Greek philosophy, or of any rationalism (ancient, medieval, or modern), as a heresy peculiar to Strauss, while it is obvious to those religious or secular ultraorthodox critics that all modern thought is as antithetical to Judaism as is Greek thought. And since "postmodern" thought is viewed by its passionate adherents as the only legitimate heir of Judaism, so to them it amounts to the same thing for Strauss to defend the Greek thinkers as to defend the modern thinkers: to study the Greeks in order to relearn their wisdom, and to study the moderns in order to</page><page sequence="8">106 Kenneth Hart Green relearn their wisdom, is equally to leave the Jewish fold. For the ultraorthodox right-wing opponents of Strauss, just as for their "postmodern" left-wing kissing cousins, debates about rationalism amount to a family quarrel in the camp of the enemies of Judaism, which is of no importance to them. For both secular and religious ultraorthodox, reason is the enemy. According to Strauss, in contrast with ultraorthodoxy whether of the religious or of the secular stripe, Jewish orthodoxy is not compromised by its encounter with Greek philosophy, because insofar as each one cannot refute the other, each one would seem to need to learn from and to face the challenges of the other, as the unbroken tradition of medieval and modern Jewish philosophy would seem to show. For Judaism, intellectual honesty or probity requires one to learn about, to think through, and hence to face courageously all serious challenges: it is the virtue of honest self knowledge through unrelenting self-examination, bringing about cleanliness of soul in the face of the one true God in which Judaism believes, Who holds man to account for his thought. Absolute honesty in thought, insofar as it is possible, is demanded by God, who makes an exclusive claim to truth, as almost every Jewish philosopher has been brought to proclaim in justifying his life devoted to the pursuit of knowledge to its furthest reaches. How ever, according to Maimonides, some type of esotericism is the proper manner of speech in which the purest of such encounters between "faith" and "knowledge" should be conducted, and the proper literary forum in which they should be carried through. Each one will continue to try to refute the other because they both lay claim to the highest truth. Hence, the discussion could lead to destructive consequences for both parties to the great debate. Even if they converge on one or several very key points, they will still also remain opposed to one another on other very key points, and hence in a continued conflict. Esotericism is meant to assure that this potentially mortal or explosive conflict remains a fruitful and civi lized intellectual discourse. Of course, the complaint has been made, ever since the medieval appearance of Maimonides' The Guide of the Perplexed and the "Book of Knowledge" in his Mishneh Torah, that this use of Plato and Aristotle amounts to a virtual betrayal of Jewish teaching in favor of Greek teaching, if not a surrender of the Jews to the Greeks, since the Jews are viewed by such critics as diametrically and absolutely opposed to the Greeks in each and every matter of importance. Yet perhaps most instructive for us in contemporary terms is the ex ample Strauss himself chose to highlight: the seemingly fundamen tal moral difference about homosexuality. It is very well known that</page><page sequence="9">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 107 ancient Greek civilization travelled farthest in pronounced toler ance for, if not declared acceptance of, homosexuality. And it is also very well known that the unambiguous and consistent moral stance of Judaism alone in the ancient world (and eventually of Christianity and Islam as well) was to oppose and condemn homosexuality in every moral sense, as contrasted with the muted tolerance of numer ous ancient Near Eastern civilizations and their polytheistic reli gions. It rejected not any human being, but rather a practice and a way of life, which it regarded as sinful. Judaism's moral "theory," concealed beneath what it calls sinful abomination, seems to have been that this separates one from God. Since man is created in the image of the one God as male and female in order to join together with the other as one, it seems to mean heterosexual love is the only Godlike, the healthiest, the best, and the most natural for man. This is not unrelated to, even if it is also not solely grounded in, the Jewish defense of the traditional family as the cornerstone of its edifice of moral law. This contrary Jewish moral stance has been maintained distinctly and almost uniquely in all the most ancient sources of Judaism, and until quite recently in all the most modern sources of Judaism as well. Yet Strauss seems to want to challenge radically such a deeply held and clear-cut contrast of values between "Greeks" and "Jews," as a sort of prejudice which is not a simple historical fact, and hence may not be asserted as if they were two plainly contrasted systems of moral truth. He makes a comment which deliberately stresses the absolute moral accord, the clearly shared moral stance, of Plato and Moses in the unambiguous moral condemnation of homosexuality, to which Strauss points in both Plato's Laws (which is his only statement on legislative justice, and his last moral statement as well), and in the Torah of Moses.3 To Strauss, this shows a much greater harmony between the two seeming antagonists than might appear on the surface from a too-hastily-reached scholarly assertion about the absolute moral differences between "all" Greek and "all" Jewish thought. In rushing to such a judgment about a supposed antagonist of Judaism, the Greek Plato has been falsely perceived as such a simple opponent; and hence "all" Greek philosophy itself has been misjudged from the point of view of Judaism. Actually, if seen in an equitable light, it seems that both Plato and Aristotle are friends and allies of Moses on numerous, if not most, substantive moral issues ? as both Maimonides and Strauss rightly perceived. And while Strauss would not deny the continued important, even radical, differences between Plato and Moses on some fundamental issues, he would also ask that their true common ground also be acknowledged honestly as this manifests itself in their moral convic</page><page sequence="10">108 Kenneth Hart Green tions, and especially in their shared notions of what is morally pure and best for most human beings. (2) This moral common ground serves as the link that it is fitting to recognize in order to move to a proper consideration of the final issue. Strauss is rightly known as a modern Jewish thinker who advocates fidelity or constancy to most of the core moral, religious, and political beliefs of Judaism as absolutes in which it was once believed by all modern Jews that Judaism is undoubtedly rooted. According to Strauss's "postmodern" critics, however, relativism is regarded as the only true moral, religious, and political friend of contemporary Judaism, and as the only teaching in which it must put its future hope. Of course, it exempts from the rule of relativism those liberal causes whose bona fides as absolute moral goods are assumed also to be in the interest of Judaism. The prime reason why Strauss's Jewish thought, and specifically his Maimonideanism, meets the needs of the present hour so well ? even if not grasped by all in the present, or even if not likely to please everyone in the present, as the previously explored moral issue which remains controversial will indicate ? is that this is an hour of the gravest crisis not only for modern Judaism, but also for modern science and modern politics as well, which are themselves still the great vindication of the modern project. For Strauss, modern philo sophic thought, and the modern world that is its consequence, are both caught in the "crisis of modernity," a deep predicament which Strauss believes is due mostly to the challenge represented by the Nietzsche and Heidegger school of thought, which he calls "radical historicism." This once led mostly to a secular right-wing ideology in the early twentieth century, and in the contemporary world of the late twentieth century produces mostly a secular left-wing following and set of dictates. It challenges the modern project even in its leading forms of modern science and modern politics, once accepted as self-evidently true and self-evidently good by all decent modern people. According to Strauss, only a return to the ancient-medieval sources of modern science and modern politics ? and that means ultimately, premodern philosophy and premodern religion ? will provide modern man with the resources in deeper self-comprehen sion he needs to save himself from the gradual but certain self destruction which he faces in the immediate future from his "postmodern," or what Strauss preferred to call, ultramodern, nem esis. This alone, for Strauss, points toward the best hope of self preservation and the best mode of self-reconstruction of the modern: he means, along with other things, through the rediscovery of the Hebrew Bible and of Judaism, since this is one of the deepest spiritual resources that Western civilization continues to depend on,</page><page sequence="11">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 109 and remains (paradoxically, considering the origins of modernity) its sturdiest line of defense against its contemporary opponents. This is argued because Strauss emphasizes that the last best hope to guarantee the survival of the truly decent aspects of both modern Judaism and modern Western civilization rests on the unconditional fidelity or constancy to certain of the absolutes in the ancient Jewish tradition (religious, moral, political, and philosophic), rather than putting our faith in some sort of needed and comprehensive relativ ism. The current relativism rests ultimately on what he regards as a pernicious radical historicism, pernicious since Strauss accepts the argument that if "God is dead" ? which he does not for one moment accept as true, yet which radical historicism is built on ? it makes everything possible, even every crime. In this light, Strauss sees things and argues in a way unlike that of almost every other contem porary Jewish thinker beyond the preserve of arguments made by the strictest modern religious ultraorthodoxy. However, their argu ments are not very helpful to him because, while they may defend the tradition of revelation, they also ignore studiously and in principle the uses, as well as the challenges, of reason ? in stark contrast with the enlightened medieval orthodoxy of Maimonides. Yet Strauss primarily expected of Jewish thinkers rigorous intellectual honesty in defending Judaism, and cognitive and moral courage in address ing the most difficult questions, lest their victory in argument be pyrrhic, or a sleight-of-hand driven by moral passion, which seri ous-minded people, however select, will eventually not be per suaded by ? and hence the defense of Judaism by these Jewish thinkers will be dismissed in the end as unsubstantial, and will cause further, deeper problems. Can the "postmodern" alternatives offer as morally compelling or as intellectually exacting a challenge as the view of Strauss? From what I have been able to observe, I would doubt it. To be sure, such positions in Jewish philosophic thought as are currently very fash ionable, and possess still vital Jewish versions ? such as religious existentialism in its current forms, a "pluralist" liberalism with a political or religious leaning toward relativism, deconstructionism, neo-Marxism, radical feminism and related sexual liberations, and avowedly atheistic existentialism of a Jewish stripe ? are clearly defined alternatives with passionate advocates and adherents. The future will tell, but my sense is that only Strauss is on the right track: if we want to preserve Judaism as well as modern Western civiliza tion rather than destroy them, this will lead us to the way suggested by Strauss; we will want to know what he knew. What one might call the reasonable fear of one who holds this position on the importance of Strauss's thought for modern man is that we will discover too late</page><page sequence="12">110 Kenneth Hart Green our need for his thought, and so will fail to heed him as our virtual "early warning system." But truth is surely not measured by imme diate historical success. Let me add a brief and limited remark on the absolute, often misrepresented in Strauss's thought. Strauss does not think we need to possess the absolute, or should accept on faith those who claim passionately to possess it ? only that we must strive for it uncondi tionally, and may claim to hold certain aspects of it in our posses sion. As this also means, he does not construe his defense of the absolute to imply putting any limits on free thought, as some critics accuse, although it may require free peoples to put some limitations on free discussion, self-limiting themselves. Free thought is in all circumstances a distinct requirement of philosophy, as Strauss cer tainly well knew, which also needs some measure of free discussion. But how much free discussion is permitted is a judgment of pru dence vested in the lawmakers and judges; and hence unlimited freedom of discussion in a free people is not among the absolute rights. Thus, adherence to the absolute expressed in the form of search for the eternal truth by no means leads to either fanaticism or sectarianism, as some critics accuse, so long as we remember the fundamental difference ? which Strauss never tired of instructing us about ? between searching for the one absolute truth, and claiming to possess the one absolute truth. The claim to possess must always be put to the most stringent cognitive tests by doubting philosophers ? although such testing and doubting may not be needed for moral absolutes. In moral matters, Strauss was a great defender of common sense. But the fundamental search for the one absolute truth needs open-mindedness as what one might call its best friend: if the one absolute truth is so difficult of possession, yet it is the one thing most needful in human life, it is essential to be willing to consider all serious claimants who contend they can truly satisfy our deepest desire. In other words, as Yaffe himself almost seems to suggest: not only is Strauss's Jewish thought necessary (as a defense of the idea of the absolute, even if claims to it must remain in conflict), but perhaps only it is most sufficient to "meet the needs of the hour," both for Judaism and for philosophy, at least compared with the available alternatives. One of the things which I was trying to argue in Jew and Philoso pher, in contrast with diverse readings of Strauss's thought, is that most do not grasp fully what he truly meant to say. This brings me to stress again Yaffe's important final words: those friends and enemies of Leo Strauss, who flatter themselves that they like to take their Strauss neat, should give careful consideration to "what would</page><page sequence="13">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 111 be lost from Strauss's thought" if his Jewish thought is not viewed as absolutely integral to his philosophic thought, and as accompanied and protected by what one might call his theological-political thought. Hence, they should also reconsider what may have been missed in the study of Strauss's thought hitherto. I am honored by the serious reflections presented by Professor Michael Wyschogrod, who is an eminent contemporary Jewish theo logian. He is the most critical of the present three commentators on my book. He offers a comprehensive critique not only of Strauss's mature esoteric reading of the Guide, but also of the entire Jewish philosophic position of Maimonides. Wyschogrod's notion is that this is a Jewish philosophy in the thrall of, or beholden to, Aristotle, whose Greekness is not separable from the essence of his thought.4 This sort of judgment should not be so simple for Wyschogrod to make, since it emerges that, for him, while Aristotle's Greekness is not separable from the essence of his thought, Heidegger's Germanness is separable from the essence of his thought. It is perhaps not entirely appropriate for me to deal critically with Wyschogrod's own theology in the present setting, since it is not the topic of our discussion, but I do so only in order to elucidate the context of thought from which, I believe, his critique of Strauss emerges. In his major work in Jewish theology, Wyschogrod shows a relatively clear and distinct preference for the spirit of the thought of the Kabbala as against the spirit of the thought of Maimonides and the Jewish philosophers. The Kabbala is closer to what is for him "authentic" Judaism, with his theological notion of Israel as a virtual human "incarnation," as it were, of God in the world and in history, through its divine election. This critique of Maimonides and the Jewish philosophers very much resembles that made by Gershom Scholem in the first chapter of his classic book, Ma;or Trends in Jewish Mysticism.5 Scholem, speaking in the name of the Jewish mystics and on their behalf, launched his critique of the Jewish philosophers in order to prove the superiority of the mystics as the thinkers with a greater Jewish "authenticity." One wonders if the observation of Strauss (made in response to the critique of Scholem) about the conflict between the Jewish mystics and the Jewish philosophers in the medieval history of Judaism, has not been confirmed once again. In defense of Maimonides and the Jewish philosophers as "authen tic" Jewish thinkers, Strauss made the following observation which employed historical evidence ironically provided by Scholem him self about the theological leaning toward Christianity and the ten dency toward Christianizing among the Jewish mystics: "It is per haps not altogether insignificant that Jewish philosophy has proved</page><page sequence="14">112 Kenneth Hart Green to be much more impervious to the influence of the Christian dogma than the Kabbala."6 Could the theology of Professor Wyschogrod perhaps be considered another confirmation of Strauss's critical observation, grounded in Scholem's historical evidence about the Christianizing tendency in Jewish mysticism as the spirit of Kabbala proceeds to shape Jewish theology, about which of the Jewish thinkers diverged from Jewish "authenticity" in their theology? Wyschogrod is certainly a thoughtful critic, who takes issue not only with Strauss's explicit teaching about the relation between biblical faith and philosophy, but who also gives an alternative account of their relations which, it seems to me, amounts to an implicit defense of Heidegger, while precisely speaking in the name of what claims to be orthodox Judaism. In other words, Wyschogrod and Strauss provide accounts of the complex relations between biblical faith and philosophy which are almost diametrically op posed, and they offer defenses of orthodox Judaism on almost diametrically opposed grounds. To state the point in perhaps some what too simple but not, I believe, in entirely overstated terms, there would seem to be a fundamental choice to be made between Wyschogrod and Strauss, which is as Wyschogrod himself poses the dilemma. But then, it is not between biblical faith and philosophy (which both Strauss and Wyschogrod keep separated), and it is also not for or against orthodox Judaism (which both defend), but be tween acceptance of Heidegger and rejection of Heidegger as the best contemporary thinker needed to help Jewish thought in its contemporary dilemmas. Perhaps because of his own sound ortho dox Judaism, Wyschogrod is relatively free of any traces of radical feminism and of deconstructionism, as well as of other recent surrenders to Heidegger in contemporary Jewish thought. Yet, next to the classical, i.e., biblical sources of Judaism, he still learns the most for his theological enterprise from Heidegger. By way of contrast, Strauss helps Jewish thought to think through a fundamen tal opposition to Heidegger, whose philosophy is according to Strauss the primary and ultimate manifestation of the crisis in modern thought which Judaism is currently also forced to pass through. To be sure, Wyschogrod was quite clear, much prior to Victor Farias, in discerning Heidegger's Nazism as a possible effect of his thought ? but for him it is not so much or so certain as to cause him to doubt the usefulness of Heidegger as an admittedly qualified guide for Jewish thought. Thus, obviously Wyschogrod would never say the sort of thing which Strauss was able to say: "Heidegger... is...intellectually the counterpart to what Hitler was politically"; or, "There is a straight line which leads from Heidegger s resoluteness to his siding with the so-called Nazis in 1933."7 This contrast or</page><page sequence="15">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 113 conflict on the chief philosophic resource which is needed for con temporary Jewish thought to draw on, brings me to focus on what I regard as the cardinal conviction in which Wyschogrod s critique of Strauss's thought is rooted, and from which the rest of his critique unfolds. Wyschogrod reveals his cardinal conviction toward the very end of his critique. He bases himself on a single passage in Guide 3.31, which he obviously believes is representative of, if not paradigmatic for, Jewish philosophy, in which Maimonides defends the entirely rational character of the commandments. Wyschogrod concludes boldly that, in such thinking, "philosophy has enslaved theology." (I will not presume to enter a discussion, in the present context, of whether that is a sound explication of Maimonides' text, since this occasion is not primarily meant to debate interpretations of the Guide. But I would definitely contest this reading, as well as the implications that he draws from it. Some of my demurrals will appear in what follows.) This leads him to speak in very harsh terms about "philosophic imperialism" based, I presume, on the two principles of: (1) a domineering but empty reason, devoid of the capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the human soul or even the needs of the human body; and (2) a boastful but dependent reason unable to escape the determined laws of history in forming all stages of human spiritual development, since nothing human can tran scend history. The alternative as offered by Wyschogrod is what he calls a "humbler" philosophy, which recognizes both its own limited capacity for knowledge, and "the impact of history on the eternal truths of classical philosophy." Strauss's position is not quite so different as it might at first appear; for certain it is, whatever Wyschogrod may imply, that Strauss in defending ancient and medieval philosophy never de fends "philosophic imperialism," or the rights of a domineering reason to rule by the same norms which guided Greek or medieval civilizations. This is a notion of philosophy that Strauss would in fact reject as false to what philosophy is by nature; and he would also regard it as missing the true value and meaning of philosophy. He would define philosophy in the spirit of Socrates as beginning with the desire for comprehensive self-awareness (as far as it is possible to attain such self-awareness, which would require that the limits of this also be defined), and whatever further awareness of the whole and its parts is required to attain such an aim of comprehensive self awareness, which strives legitimately to transcend history toward eternity. Yet as Strauss would also surely recognize, there is "impe rialistic philosophy," and this is precisely modern philosophy ? but not philosophy per se. And to Strauss, Heidegger is in this sense</page><page sequence="16">114 Kenneth Hart Green fully a modern, if not the most ultramodern, philosopher. The question that then emerges is: who is truly the defender of "philo sophic imperialism"? As far as I can discern, the combined effect of these convictions moves Wyschogrod to something like the following two consequent theses in his critique of Strauss, in which he contains his further critique of philosophy. He wishes us to recognize philosophy's limited capacity for knowledge due to history; yet, he also raises a virtually supreme claim for history to judge philosophy. Hence, it is not a Kantian or neo-Kantian position, which would adhere to the rationally determined limits of knowledge, with science rather than history the best key to such limits. He wishes us to recognize the decisive "impact of history" on philosophy; yet, he also wants to use such an "impact" as a sign or a proof of philosophy's limited capacity, rather than as an entry to absolute knowledge. Hence, it is not a Hegelian position, which would adhere to the final philosophic system, to the completed meaning of History as rationally knowable, with History itself as the most comprehensive philosophic principle. From these two consequent theses we begin to get a taste of the strange but heady brew which is known to have been recommended by Wyschogrod in his previous writings: a concoction of Heideggerian atheistic existentialism mixed in with, or purified by, a theology supposedly culled from the Hebrew Bible, from the midrashim, and from Kabbala, and presented as orthodox Judaism. Maimonides and Strauss are to be rejected because they defend "eternal truths," a notion which he limits to "classical philosophy," and which he tacitly ejects from Jewish theology. In the end, then, there is not so much to his claim that Maimonides or Strauss reject theology, or permit it to be "enslaved to philosophy," but rather, it is that they embrace a theology which Wyschogrod considers not "authentic" to Judaism. This is further highlighted by his suggestion that Maimonides misused or misappropriated the rabbinic method for his own Greekifying philosophic purposes. He claims "[the rabbis] had al most no interest in eliminating biblical anthropomorphism while this was one of Maimonides' main concerns." Every "as it were" the rabbis employed and so often attached to bold theological state ments about God s human attributes, is obviously for Wyschogrod either an apologetic reflex action or an unrepresentative diversion. This in the end leads Wyschogrod to relegate Maimonides to the position of an advocate for a strange hybrid called "Platonic Aristotelianism," in "the truth" of which, pure and simple, he apparently believed. As Wyschogrod puts it: "This is the point at which Strauss and Maimonides meet." As Wyschogrod tells the</page><page sequence="17">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 115 story, it is this which drew Strauss to Maimonides. It was not the undaunted, deep-thinking, and unapologetic cognitive encounter staged by Maimonides, in which he contrasted Judaism with phi losophy, and in which notwithstanding his staunch Jewish faith he remained receptive to and made use of the genuine truth attained by philosophy, irrespective of its ethnic, moral, or metaphysical source. (See Eight Chapters, "Introduction.") It was not that in doing all of this Maimonides also courageously defended the truths of Judaism against false claims to knowledge made by philosophy and science. In other words, Strauss was not drawn to a Maimonides who was a "Jewish philosopher" of genuine profundity. It would further seem to follow for Wyschogrod that the Judaism which Maimonides supposedly teaches and defends is scarcely something to which he guides us properly or represents well ? although perhaps one should not banish or disenfranchise him since he was, however strange to admit, the author of a great Jewish law code which has been quite useful to most Jewish scholars. As Wyschogrod comes to imply, we cannot actually learn anything of much use from Maimonides7 Guide for Jewish philosophy in the present, but per haps we should preserve the memory of it as a worthy and instruc tive example, a cautionary tale, of how a Jewish philosopher may go very wrong. One should note that according to this same reasoning employed by Wyschogrod ? Maimonides and Strauss do not learn from Plato things which are useful for their defense of Judaism, but surrender their Judaism to their Platonism, if not to their "Platonic Aristotelianism" ? it would be possible to argue that Wyschogrod does not learn from Heidegger things which are useful for his defense of Judaism, but is merely the advocate of a lightly Judaized Heideggerianism as this may be conceived in and applied to contem porary Judaism. Indeed, for a Straussian countercritique of Wyschogrod, one would need to reflect on the continued relevance of Strauss's suggestion about an apparent difference between Greek thought and German thought, and how it exercises an influence on their respective uses for Judaism: "The greatest achievements of Jews during the Spanish period were partly rendered possible by the fact that Jews became open to the influx of Greek thought, which was understood to be Greek only accidentally. During the German pe riod, however, the Jews became open to the influx of German thought, of the thought of the particular nation in the midst of which they lived ? of a thought which was understood to be German essentially."8 Wyschogrod isolates rightly the fundamental issue with regard to both Maimonides and Strauss: "the basic question is whether</page><page sequence="18">116 Kenneth Hart Green philosophy and biblical faith are compatible." But it is Wyschogrod's characterization of Strauss's answer to this question that is, I think, decidedly flawed. He mischaracterizes Strauss's notion of the essen tial differences between philosophy and biblical faith, and so he is led to wrongly construe Strauss's answer to the question of their compatibility. In other words, for Strauss what is needed first is the proper definition of the essence of philosophy on the one hand, and of biblical faith on the other, in order to characterize properly how and why they either diverge from, or are compatible with, one another. All prior essential definitions of the Hebrew Bible and Greek philosophy, accepted in the Western tradition, must be ques tioned and rethought in light of the very modern crisis which for Strauss is plain to see, especially in the Heideggerian moment which challenges all traditional assertions, along with the very idea of tradition, as problematic. This is merely the logical consequence that follows if one is only able to define "the eternal truths" in terms of what has been made of them by "the impact of history," which in the decisive sense determines them. To simplify rather dramatically, I believe Strauss would say in essence something of the following sort: although they may disagree on some important fundamental matters ("theory," i.e., metaphys ics, astronomy, physics, theology, cosmology), so long as they agree on some important subordinate matters ("practice," i.e., ethics law, politics, religion), they may still possess much common ground. To be sure, even such a scheme unduly and rather too simply opposes things which are not quite so opposed. "Practice" is not their only area of accord; for "theory," think of the tendency toward monothe ism of both Plato's Laws and Aristotle's Metaphysics, and the account of creation in Plato's Timaeus which medieval Jewish thinkers were so impressed by. However, perhaps for a moment I forgot to dismiss all of these medieval Jewish thinkers as in thrall to the Greeks. In the case of the compatibility between philosophy and biblical faith, we might mention as the primary common grounds: common purposes for human life (goodness as human beings, and devotion to something higher than the human things); common notions of the good life (family, worship, community, polity), and of the need to transcend human life in the direction of what is not transient (the eternal, the divine); common notions of noble action (just rule, charity, search for wisdom, capacity for noble self-sacrifice); com mon ideas about the highest being (as the one, and as the origin). To put it as succinctly as possible: the long dialogue or debate between Greek-derived philosophy and Hebrew-derived religion, which char acterizes the history of Western civilization, is not a mere accident of history, but is something unavoidable, because it is connected to</page><page sequence="19">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 117 as great a number of important essential similarities as of important essential differences. If Maimonides and Strauss both ask indeed what Wyschogrod rightly calls the "basic question" ? "whether philosophy and bibli cal faith are compatible" ? it is because they both believed a perfectly good case can be made for the claim to the truth of both sides. This is the proper beginning point for Strauss's thinking about Maimonides: philosophy and the Bible have never been able to refute one another. And hence that they both remain standing and opposed to one another is because, in considering what is for both of them the fundamental problem or the ultimate concern, i.e., what is the truth?, it remains the case that no one side has been able to vanquish the other. Hence, I do not believe that to suggest philosophy and theology cannot refute one another and hence must encounter one another as well as learn from one another, is in any sense to "reverse" myself, as Wyschogrod states I or Strauss do. This is, rather, something about which Wyschogrod reverses himself, as he more or less admits by saying: "until [he] read Green's book," he believed that Greek philosophy is the only source of truth for Maimonides and for Strauss. Surely this means it was in his view of Maimonides and Strauss that the Bible merely serves to hold together the Jewish polity. He begins ? as I do not ? with a Maimonides (and, I daresay, with a Strauss as well) who unconditionally surrenders his Judaism to Greek philosophy in the matter of what the truth is. How is this to reverse myself if I suggest something about what Strauss and Maimonides teach which is different than what was previously believed only by Wyschogrod himself? According to this same prior belief of Wyschogrod, for both Maimonides and Strauss the "Jewish polity" is apparently just like any other polity. While appearing a plausible argument at first glance, because for both Maimonides and Strauss the contents of the Torah can be understood and reasoned about in terms of politics as it relates to philosophy, natural theology, and science, still I am compelled to differ with him on this point for several reasons. Let us consider Strauss alone: beneath Strauss's modern commitment to Judaism, I would argue, he undoubtedly recognized the belief in the Jews as the "chosen people" was something that he could not himself so readily escape, however he defined this term. But if the Jews are the "chosen people," so the philosophic truth, whether Greek or not, cannot be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, for pre-Heideggerrian philosophy does not recognize chosen peoples.9 And this at the very least suggests the further possibility that there may then be for Strauss ? and likewise for Maimonides ? a truth</page><page sequence="20">118 Kenneth Hart Green bigger than what is dreamed of in philosophy. Certainly it suggests that for Maimonides, even if the "Jewish polity" is like any other polity in almost every sense, at least for purposes of understanding its law, it is still the one best law, the one best polity, whose overarching principle is devotion to the truth. (For the Torah is only called law, is only put in common terms with other law, and is only capable of being compared to other systems of law, if they occupy something of the same species, even if Torah is the highest or most perfect of its species.) Such is clearly and distinctly the "faith" of Maimonides, for which he does not apologize to the philosophers. Strauss calls Judaism a faith of a "superior rationality."10 But Strauss certainly also recognizes that Judaism is still a faith, even if the most rational faith; the highest virtue is still "obedient love." But because it is a faith mostly enacted through law, Torah as divinely revealed law is quite compatible, in the view of Strauss and Maimonides, with its being mostly a rational law ? albeit in Maimonides' sense of "rational." This means that it is something teleologically rational: it aims, by means which may not be entirely rational, toward ends which are entirely rational. Hence I would also diverge from what Professor Wyschogrod implies about a rational law and a rational faith for Maimonides not being compatible with the Akeida. It is certain that this rationality is compatible with the Akeida for Strauss precisely as a Maimonidean, since he plainly acknowledges that God's command to Abraham "transcended rea son." Indeed, it is on just this point that Strauss makes his critique of Cohen turn.11 The Akeida is compatible with the rationality of Judaism also for Maimonides because he acknowledges, precisely on this-worldly political grounds although not only on these grounds, the need for some highest commands of God to "transcend reason," and hence for God's command to Abraham to "transcend reason." For what reason does divine law need to "transcend reason"? Just because it is theological law, does not mean it ceases to be political law. If a state asks a citizen to sacrifice (or potentially sacrifice) his life in the cause of defending that state as the price for him to receive the benefits of the state, it is not clear whether this can ever be made fully compatible with reason for the individual citizen, although perhaps it can make a great deal of rational sense for the state as a collective entity. Perhaps any such defense must resort to some sort of "otherworldly" appeal, even if only on collective grounds, which "transcends reason" for the individual himself: whether it is the bombastic appeal to the eternal glory of Athens made by Pericles in Thucydides, or the rather shockingly modest appeal to the eternal idea of freedom made by Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg. The</page><page sequence="21">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 119 history of the Jews has been such that fidelity to Judaism is known to call for "heroic obedience," and on this ground alone the Akeida stands for the highest fidelity of Jews to Judaism. Is this irrational? Not if one's connection to others in society can be seen in the light of a rational teleology, and if such teleology itself is intelligible as a rational form of explanation for human beings who truly lead life according to their reason, and if the society whose law one sacrifices oneself for is dedicated to the highest truth, indeed, to "the infinitely highest."12 For most others, who are not truly rational beings, per haps it must receive a poetic covering ? but that does not make the arguments concealed beneath this poetic covering teleologically irrational. And beyond the political rationale, if Judaism offers Abraham as its model, it is because of his willingness to sacrifice his own promised son and hence his eternal future; he made a choice in which he disregarded whatever God promised to do for him and rather acted for the purest love of God. Is it so fundamentally different, from the point of view of pure rationality, than Socrates' choice to sacrifice himself for philosophy rather than to escape? As this suggests, Strauss recognized that the pure love of wisdom "transcends reason," just as surely as the pure love of God "tran scends reason." However, Wyschogrod next shifts to a higher gear in his critique of Strauss: reason and revelation are two quite separate things which properly have nothing to do with one another, because the essence of what makes them separate is "argument" versus "revelation." They can safely remain separate, and even hermetically sealed, from one another at no cost to their own integrity. Apparently "it is not necessary for philosophy to refute revelation," because revelation is simply not comprehensible to reason, in terms of what would be acceptable to reason, and hence revelation does not play any role in the life of reason. This way of portraying their difference has some plausibility to it, but I do not believe that it is sufficient. This portrait makes sense only if reason is self-sustaining or self-justifying, if it is true that reason can adequately account for the whole, or if it possesses the comprehensive argument to justify itself as a way of life. If it is not true, what reason can it offer for not considering the wisdom of revelation as the possible highest truth? This only makes sense if reason is purely a dogmatism (e.g., the completed "system" of fixed arguments and demonstrations) rather than a simple search for wisdom, as its fundamental and ever-defensible rationale to which it must ever recur. That is, reason is a dogmatism if it has been led to abandon philosophy, defined literally as the "love of wis dom," for what should properly be its subordinate, i.e., science, which may be defined as the "possession of wisdom." Philosophy</page><page sequence="22">120 Kenneth Hart Green may well seem to depend on things it cannot truly prove ? the complete intelligibility or explainability of the universe, of being. And this position similarly only makes sense for revelation if it is true that it is pure faith (credo quia absurdum est), i.e., a purely irrational or "assertoric" fideism which need not make any sense in terms of reason, need not be coherent, and need not be consistent with anything other than itself. In other words, it makes sense if, in the domain of religion which relies on revelation, what might be called "blind faith" rules. But Strauss, like Maimonides, emphati cally stresses the greater rationality of Judaism as a religion, if it is not for them the most rational religion; it may not be a religion of reason, but it is a proudly reasonable religion until it reaches the point at which faith, which does "transcend reason," enters. In response to Wyschogrod's comment on the meaning of Plato's Euthyphro, I would refer him to my note on this in Jew and Philoso pher.n Regarding the Euthyphro of Plato, for Strauss it seems to represent the philosopher as unable to believe in active but happy gods ? but he also seems to recognize that the one God presents a much graver challenge to Socrates' doubts, and indeed is not suscep tible of such an ironic refutation as Socrates presents. In my judg ment, a similar account would not have been available to Socrates to convince the biblical monotheist he is misguided in his piety. And certainly what Wyschogrod says about the Euthyphro as it differs from the biblical monotheist view in his The Body of Faith does not contradict anything Strauss says on the same topic.14 Notwithstanding all of this, if reason and revelation are such spiritual antagonists as Strauss argues that they remain, how can conversation be possible or fruitful between them? It is because, contrary to their fundamental disagreements, it is also apparent that they are in fundamental agreement about some equally essential matters. In Strauss's mind, one of the contemporary things which they share is an unambiguous rejection of the entire context of twentieth-century thought, i.e., radical historicism, especially as it appears in its array of current versions and admixtures. Some of these matters have already been addressed in my response to Yaffe; and I also deal with some of these issues in the sixth and seventh chapters of my book, which points I will not repeat.15 It is apparently some of the very simple premises that they also share ? the one thing needful is knowing the truth, however, each may grasp this truth differently ? which make it imperative for both the Bible and philosophy to attempt to refute one another. If so, the charge of "imperialism" leveled against philosophy cuts both ways. In other words, not to take up spiritual arms is to give up life for both of them, if only for defensive reasons.</page><page sequence="23">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 121 Against the impression created by Wyschogrod that the debate is merely between philosophy defined as "argument" versus biblical religion defined as simple "revelation/' the historical fact of this debate itself leads us to discern a deeper accord, however superficial the accord may seem at first glance, as well as a deeper difference. Greek philosophy and the Hebrew Bible would seem to agree first that the truth is one, and next, that this one truth is somehow "transcendent." Insofar as God is truth for both, it would seem the biblical and the Platonic philosophic views converge. However, they disagree about who God is, what constitutes this oneness, and how it is "transcendent": whether at the highest level it is unknowable in principle as the product of a created order ruled by the supranatural and omnipotent divine will, or whether at the highest level it is knowable, actually or potentially, as the product of an evident and necessary nature ruled by divine mind. These are the most signifi cant differences, but the choice for one or the other may depend on grounds which cannot be fully defended in terms of reasonable argument or natural evidence ? a much greater and graver diffi culty for philosophy than for revealed religion. The philosopher makes his choice supposedly on the basis of true knowledge of the whole, and Strauss prefers to call this that which should be "evident and necessary" knowledge of the whole. But if the philosopher does not actually possess such "evident and necessary" knowledge of the whole, he cannot claim superiority, in his own subordinate terms of reasonable argument or natural evidence to the position of faith ? his is also a sort of act of faith, an unevident decision, and hence not a decision dictated by rational necessity. Wyschogrod seems disposed to follow my presentation of Strauss's view on the similarity between the Platonic arguments which culminate in a highest insight cognitively "seen" but not a thesis discursively "argued," and the believer's deepest experience of his "faith" ? which two positions, however, merely resemble but cannot be equated or identified with one another. But what he thinks about the implications of this presentation is not entirely clear; he merely says that it "can use a bit of unpacking." The philosopher must claim to base himself on something very much like faith in the form of an intellectual intuition of the whole as an intelligible and articulated natural unity, which to be sure is certainly not identical with the biblical faith. It is like faith, however, in a crucial sense because it cannot be articulated as the philosopher would like to be able to express or explain it, i.e., as demonstration. He does not yet know the whole, so he cannot claim to properly order the parts. And so apparently both the man of biblical faith and the Socratic philoso</page><page sequence="24">122 Kenneth Hart Green pher believe in the being of the truth as one thing, and as something higher than what can be fully grasped by us. If both their conflicting final wisdoms, and their seemingly shared highest notions of truth, do not settle their dispute, perhaps we can learn something by asking: whose life is most evident of unity, the man of biblical faith or the Socratic philosopher, as an integrity reflective of the higher unity? It might not be so simple to choose morally between an Akiva and a Socrates, else the life of Socrates and the life of Akiva would not have been so impressive to such great numbers of generations. Even Yehuda Halevi, the great est defender of the spiritual uniqueness and moral superiority of Judaism in medieval Jewish thought, acknowledges the impressive ness of the life of Socrates and those philosophers who are like him: see Kuzari 4.19 and 5.14. (In this context, we must also not forget that Akiva was viewed not just as a great legal mind but also as the master of speculative knowledge, and not just in Maimonides' scheme ? see Guide 1.32 ? but also in mystical as well as in the most tradition alist circles as well.) Might the unity of the life led, insofar as it is based on such knowledge, reflect the unity of truth in each as a highest human type? We must return again to what is perhaps the basic question, i.e., the matter of the type of life: what is the good life for man? But both claim the other one leads a defective life if it is not joined with or supplemented by its own vital and active expression of its truth. On the one hand, does the philosopher lead a life which is unfulfilled and empty, if not tragic, as the man of biblical faith charges? On the other hand, does the man of biblical faith lead a life which is never consistent or free of self-contradiction, and hence makes no self-justifying sense, and often is led morally astray as a result, as the Socratic philosopher charges? Whose life is "superior" in terms of wholeness or unity? As Strauss concludes, the history of their dispute suggests they also cannot refute one another even at the level of morality, i.e., of the life each leads. This issue too remains unresolved; but they both still remain vitally engaged in the argu ment for the sake of that unity and "transcendence" of the one truth which they both revere, although this certainly does not prevent them from differing on the most important issue of the content of that truth. I conclude with two words to the wise, one from a Greek source, and the other from a Jewish source: "I am a friend of Plato, and I am a friend of truth, but I am a greater friend of truth." "The seal of the Holy One, blessed be He, is truth" (Nicomachean Ethics 1.6.1096al4-17; Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 55a, and Talmud Yerushalmi, Sanhedrin 1:5). Last but not least, I would like to respond to the comments of Laurence Berns. I am very grateful to Professor Berns for his kind</page><page sequence="25">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 123 words about the adequacy or competence of my representation of Strauss's thought. This is of even greater value to me for the fact that he is known as a man who makes most careful judgments. As a friend of Strauss's who has also been a devoted and a probing student of his thought, Berns's critical approbation means to me a great deal indeed. In the overview of my book which Berns offers, he judges my focus on Maimonides and his Jewish thought to signify the follow ing: it is my argument that, in Strauss's tacit understanding, moder nity is rooted in a transformed and yet preserved biblical faith. Yet how can this be the case if it is so well known that modern philosophy was in its very origins fundamentally opposed to revealed religion, seemingly moved by "antitheological ire/' and severely critical of the Bible? This well-known character of modern philosophy is not some subsequent mythical construct, according to Strauss, but was the line it itself evidently pursued in consequence of the modern philosophic desire both to change the world and to make it safe for philosophy ? or to do the one through the other. As one might put the matter according to Strauss, modern philosophy appropriated biblical moral ideas, and even acted on impulses drawn from biblical religion (e.g., on its messianic faith), but it did so paradoxically in the very act of denying biblical religion. And yet unlike most views which might seem to resemble those of Strauss, he does not regard such a process as a legitimate "secularization," which as a descrip tion of a historical process is in his view not an adequate or even a fully intelligible explanation of what actually happened. Rather, modern philosophy is the attempt to affirm and deny simulta neously the same moral principles ? or if you prefer, to affirm and deny simultaneously the same biblical faith which grounds those moral principles. If such is a correct version of Berns's analysis of my argument, in accord with his judgment he uncovers a further argument in the book's subterranean construction, i.e., in a threefold division in the book. Chapters 1 through 3 deal with the modern conflict between reason and revelation that Strauss first encountered in Spinoza, who was forced to leave the matter unresolved, while claiming the matter had been settled by him in favor of reason. This coincidentally led Strauss to rediscover Maimonides who, on Platonic grounds, reached a stalemate position in this conflict between the two fundamental antagonists, a position that is undoubtedly closer to what may truly be achieved by human thought in terms of what is genuinely know able. Chapters 4 through 5 deal with the reconciliation of reason and revelation in Maimonides' Platonic "prophetology," which bases</page><page sequence="26">124 Kenneth Hart Green itself on the cosmological stalemate between reason and revelation (i.e., creation versus eternity). Through this grave human need for the highest divine wisdom which reconciles what reason and revela tion teach, the prophetic lawgiver is elevated to the standing of the perfect philosopher-king, who not only knows the highest truths of reason but also surpasses them with the even higher truths of revelation, while ordering society toward virtue through the essen tial imaginative vehicle of divine law, in which such highest truths are represented and reconciled, and through which they are commu nicated to and impressed on the many and the few, each according to his own need and ability. Chapters 6 through 7 deals again with the conflict between reason and revelation, but in Strauss's fully mature recurrence to the topic he treats their conflict differently: the reconciliation, especially between the passionate many and the rational few, is not so neatly achieved by the prophet as it was claimed in the previous section. Strauss reaches his deepest level of comprehension of the fundamen tal issue. What is attained by the prophet in Maimonides' scheme, as he himself knew but deliberately obscured, is opinion, if well grounded or even best-grounded opinion, but not knowledge. No final and absolute answers to the highest or deepest human ques tions are possible, or have yet been achieved. But some resolutions are better than others, on both moral and cognitive grounds. And of Strauss's final judgment, we may perhaps conclude: the highest prophetic teaching, in which the Hebrew Bible is rooted, is about as good as it gets on both those grounds. Berns next raises some issues which "supplement" my account. He thinks I do not appreciate the full significance of Strauss's youthful rediscovery of Socrates, and through this his recovery of the idea that true freedom of thought means freedom from authority in the sense of freedom from any generally accepted opinion, how ever well-grounded. I would consider what I wrote on these specific issues in my notes especially (e.g., on page 201 note 14) as adequate to meet such tacit criticism. But perhaps this is to miss the point of his criticism, as its sharper edge would seem to emerge in the next paragraph. Berns means to correct what he believes is a wrong impression I create, or am myself misguided by: he demurs at my suggestion that Strauss was instructed by radical historicism so as to learn about the limits of modern science. By awakening to Socrates, Strauss immediately rediscovered ancient philosophy and science. Strauss did not need historicism, according to Berns, because he learned from "those simple human experiences of right and wrong" so as to rediscover natural right, and thus also eventually its roots in the still-standing classical notion of nature. The words Berns quotes</page><page sequence="27">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 125 are drawn from Natural Right and History.16 This is significant be cause I would suggest that the full import of Strauss's rediscovery of nature did not occur to him all at once and from the beginning. To be sure, Strauss had been able to achieve some sense of the problematic character or the limits of modern science and philoso phy from his study of Spinoza. Eventually he learned he did not need and could not legitimately use radical historicism to establish the limits of modern science, which approach to the exposure of those limits he quickly moved beyond. He did this because he recognized almost immediately that the consequence of the lesson learned from radical historicism, as radical historicism, leads away from all science, if not from all intellectual honesty. Indeed, this further exacting insight gradually led him, by a strange reversal, to learn the lesson of much greater significance: that he needed classical science in order to establish the limits of, if not to refute, radical historicism, by clarifying its dubious premises. Classical science, as he began to rediscover, was still available to him in its essential truth, derived from its human science, which essential truth of its human science does derive from "those simple human experiences of right and wrong" which endure or are always available or are always the same for human beings. The roots of such "simple human experiences" are planted in common sense, which Strauss never lost sight of, but which he also had to learn to trust in himself. Classical philosophic science instructed him to look to the political, which it viewed through the lens of common sense, of the citizen; this led Strauss to conclude that the most essential and permanent character of politi cal things endures unchanged because human nature endures un changed, in spite of history. The still available ground of classical science is a teleology of human nature, in which the natural tendency of some, if not all, human beings is to grow toward reason and to fulfill themselves in rational self-awareness as the same natural tendency in every generation and in every society, in every time and place, and hence suggests a fixed human nature which endures in spite of all historical changes. The classical science of man was built on such simple human experiences as the human need for and search for wisdom, and the interpretation of other human things which follow from these observations. Once one relearns to see man in such a simple but ever-recurring natural light, one begins to perceive how dark it looks in the world created by "radical historicism" ? artifi cial light makes one depend on human will, and only so long as such will remains good enough to provide the lighting. Berns praises me for treating the stages in Strauss's intellectual development properly, and especially for "explicating each work in its own terms, so that one gets a very clear picture of what he found</page><page sequence="28">126 Kenneth Hart Green especially convincing at each stage." Fully accepting as I do this wise comment by Professor Berns on the proper historical procedure or mode of developmental explanation in a philosophic biography, I think he asks me in this "supplement" to commit the very error or weakness which he praises me for avoiding: at the early stage of his philosophic development, Strauss may well have/e/f these things (as we might perhaps gather from his strong sense of moral judgment), but I doubt whether he was yet willing to trust his own intuitions, his own "simple human experience of right and wrong" as a most fundamental fact possessing true cognitive value. Radical histori cism (i.e., Nietzsche and Heidegger) helped to liberate Strauss from the dependence on modern science as the binding truth, as the absolute and final truth, about nature. This was fortuitous for Strauss as it was not perhaps for Nietzsche and Heidegger, espe cially since modern science that he knew best, i.e., twentieth-century social science, denied all "factual" character to values. Yet Strauss somehow "knew" values were real, he "knew" values were not just projections of human ideals as wishes or hopes. (If for no other reason, as a Jew faced with Nazi Germany, he "knew" the social scientists could not be right.) Wondering about how he "knew" it, and also not abandoning those common sense moral judgments, he grew to trust his own human experiences and natural insights, perhaps because his "intransigent common sense" (as it has been called) led him gradually to recognize the solid ground which ancient natural right stands on, and so brought him to reconsider Plato and Aristotle, who also somehow "knew" the same truth about values as facts. In other words, Strauss learned to doubt modern science, but he did not ever doubt the natural desire for science, the idea of science, and hence the possibility of science, because he perceived science as grounded in human rationality, the proofs for which he drew from history, from human nature, and from "simple human experience," which indicated compelling evidence. The key element, then, of Berns's focus, is his pointing to Strauss's concern with recovering the true meaning of science, the true knowl edge of nature in itself, which to me is a very helpful emphasis. There is not much which I would add here to what Berns says about Strauss's notions of noetic heterogeneity, other than to mention what has already been said on these points in my book, as well as by such astute commentators on Strauss as Thomas Pangle, Stanley Rosen, and David Lowenthal.17 Now we know Strauss described himself as in his youth a dubious adherent of Cohen's neo-Kantianism, a philosophic movement highly attuned to the question of the cognitive status of scientific knowledge as solely a product of the categories of the human mind; and Strauss was also deeply im</page><page sequence="29">Response to Three Comments on Jew and Philosopher 127 pressed by Husserl, whose phenomenology was an attempt to re cover the original uses of sense perception, and the original meaning of science, in post-Kantian limitations; and Strauss was always aware of the "scientific" side of Nietzsche, who regarded himself as in continuity with the aims of the original radical Enlightenment to use mind to rationally transform the world, as made evident in such thinkers as Spinoza. Strauss seemed to somehow know that the problem or crisis of modern social science is only a smaller aspect of thelarger problem or crisis of modern natural science. Berns rightly highlights this in bringing to light Strauss's answer to a question from a student about the history of modern scientific thought from Galileo to Newton: as Berns tells the story, if Strauss could ask them anything, he would want to ask Plato and Aristotle if this peculiarly modern science and its history would cause them to modify their respective doctrines of the forms in any fundamental way? (And would perhaps the matter of Darwin and the status of permanent natural species, as the essential terrestrial forms, heed to be added to Strauss's desired query of Plato and Aristotle?) It is clear that the history of modern scientific thought from Galileo to Newton is still the greatest revolution in the philosophic grasp of the natural world, and especially the celestial world, since Western science proper began in ancient Greece. However, would the modern scientific revolution also change in any decisive respect their conception of the fundamental order of things (i.e., what Plato and Aristotle both called "forms"), hence their conception of the fundamental human order of things, hence their conception of the best political order or the best life for man, and hence their conception of man? By way of a conclusion, I fully accept Berns's characterization of the "central idea" in my book ("the mutual irrefutability of reason and revelation"), as well as his elaboration of the philosophic grounds for that "central idea." The evidence for the philosophic life is merely the evidence of well-grounded opinion, not true knowledge, as would require the complete science of wisdom about the whole. As such, as knower of mere parts and their differences, the philoso pher cannot seem to do away with the continually problematic character of philosophy itself even for the philosopher ? although this also satisfies the philosopher that arguments against philosophy remain or continue to be equally problematic. Reason and revelation continue to try to refute one another; yet it also seems that if they cannot refute one another pure and simple, this stalemate also even compels them to learn from one another for the sake of honesty in holding to whatever truth they perceive. As we might say, they live primarily in the continuing tension, in the not yet completed argu ment of the two fundamental "antagonists in the drama of the soul"</page><page sequence="30">128 Kenneth Hart Green about which of the two ultimately stands in the right. It is this question or debate that keeps Western civilization vital and vigor ous, to which Judaism continues to contribute by staying at its post, by defending its own highest view of things, while remaining willing to learn from and to speak to its perennial opponent, philosophy, whom it will never cease to attempt to persuade of its own truth.

This is perhaps the most important "metaphysical" question that remains in dispute, and has been much discussed by careful students of Strauss's thought. It still deserves further treatment, since what Strauss's precise views on these matters were, and how they relate to his theological and political views which are better known, are issues which have neither been fully clarified nor have their implications in his thought yet been adequately traced. I refer to such notions as: the natural classes of things; noetic heterogeneity; the whole and the parts; the primacy and priority of a cognitively perceived unity; nature, or final and formal causes; the cognitive status of forms and of the soul; divine intelligence and divine will. Thus, see especially: Thomas L. Pangle, "Introduction," in Leo Strauss, Studies in Platonic Political Philosophy, ed. Thomas L. Pangle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), pp. 1-26, and esp. pp. 2-6, 18-23; David Lowenthal, "Review of Studies in Platonic Political Philosophy by Leo Strauss and edited by Thomas L.

Some of these issues have also been touched on in Jew and Philosopher, and esp. pp. 25-39; 167, note 127; 176, notes 43 and 44. And one should also consider carefully: Victor Gourevitch, "Phi losophy and Politics," in Review of Metaphysics 22 (1968): 58-84, 281 328, and esp. 281-296; Richard Kennington, "Strauss's Natural Right and History," in Leo Strauss's Thought: Toward a Critical Engagement, ed. Alan Udoff (Boulder, Colorado: Lynne Rienner, 1991), pp. 227 252; Stewart Umphrey, "Natural Right and Philosophy," in Leo Strauss: Political Philosopher and Jewish Thinker, ed. Kenneth L. Deutsch and Walter Nicgorski (Lanham, Maryland: Rowmanand Littlefield, 1994), pp. 275-295; Ted V. McAllister, "The Philosopher," in Revolt Against Modernity: Leo Strauss, Eric Voegelin, and the Search for a Postliberal Order (Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1996), pp. 176-221, and esp. pp. 204-218. In my view, I would both agree and disagree with the conclusion of Stanley Rosen in his essay, "Leo Strauss and the Quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns," in Leo Strauss's Thought, ed. Alan Udoff, pp. 155-168, and esp. p. 164.1 agree that for Strauss the moral distinctions are natural, fundamental, and directly accessible; but then again, I would maintain along with this that there are for Strauss transmoral truths, or what Rosen calls "purely theo retical objects of philosophical eros," however difficult of access, and even uncertain, our knowledge of them is. Strauss is not a Kantian or neo-Kantian, as Rosen suggests, because although it is true that for him the moral distinctions are natural, fundamental, and directly accessible, this naturalness of the moral distinctions is shown to presuppose a deeper level of distinctions articulated or rather made visible through this moral dimension. In other words, in order to philosophize, which always begins with the natural moral distinc tions whether admitted or unadmitted, one eventually must recog nize them as based on a prior "intellectual intuition," or as Strauss prefers to put this, on "a fundamental awareness of the whole." The</page><page sequence="32">130 Kenneth Hart Green content of this "fundamental awareness of the whole" can perhaps only be articulated discursively as opinion, or as one hopes, as well grounded opinion; but the well-groundedness depends on how suf ficient the opinion is to what was "seen" in the mind s eye of the whole in its unity beyond the parts, usually glimpsed through those parts of the whole that we do know, i.e., the "human things." These "human things" which are truly known, i.e., primarily the political matters in what Maimonides called the "sublunar sphere" (while also compre hended ultimately by fundamental principles about the whole, i.e., the theological opinions), must be acknowledged to rest on the natu ral moral distinctions, which by their simple evidentness and re peated manifestation as good and evil, noble and base, also reveal their necessary character. It is the meaning of this transcendental apprehension that Rosen especially, I would say directly impelled by Strauss, has been devoted to exploring, examining our cognitive capacity for such apprehension, and clarifying our unavoidable de pendence on it. As I would suggest, then, there is undoubtedly contained in Strauss's thought on the naturalness of the moral dis tinctions an implied notion of the necessary character of the "funda mental awareness of the whole," of a higher human awareness.</page></plain_text>
