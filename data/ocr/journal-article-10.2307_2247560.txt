<plain_text><page sequence="1">IX.-NEW BOOKS. A Brief Introduction to Modern Philosophy. By ARTHUR KENYON ROGERS, Ph.D. New York: The Macmillan Co. London: Mac- millan &amp; Co., 1899. Pp. viii., 360. As a first book to be placed in the hands of the beginner in Philosophy, this little work is in every respect admirable. The key-note is struck in the first words of the preface: " The following pages have been written with a definite aim in view. This aim has been, in as untechnical a way as possible, and with as little presupposition of previous philosophical training, to show how the problems of philosophy, which are apt to seem to the student on his first introduction to them rather arbitrary and unintelligible and with no very apparent relation to the concrete in- terests of life, in reality are not manufactured problems, but arise of necessity out of any attempt to understand the world and to appreciate the value which belongs to human experience." We believe that Dr. Rogers has succeeded in accomplishing the task which he has set for himself. He begins by pointing out that a Philosophy is simply a connected view of life as a whole, and a certain practical attitude towards it. Its aim is to " do thoroughly and in full consciousness of itself, what in popular thinking we do in a loose and unsystematic fashion". The author then proceeds to expound and to compare critically the main theories which have been advanced by various philosophers. At the outset he discusses " Dualism, Pantheism and Theism". Dualism is condemned on the ground that " any two things which are taken to start with as sepaxrate from each other necessarily require some larger con- ception if they are to be brought into relation, for a relation implies that, after all, they do come within some kind of a unity". Pantheism either " puts the reality back of finite things which are merely its manifestations: or it identifies reality with the finite things taken collectively ". In the first case, it cuts the unifying principle from the things which it is supposed to unify; in the second it yields "no unity at all, but only a jumble of conflicting particulars ". If a third alternative is adopted and particulars are treated as illusive appearances, Pantheism denies the very facts which it endeavours to explain. The author's own Philosophy is a form of Theism, which is only developed gradually as the book proceeds so as to lead up to the final chapters in which it is explicitly expounded. At the outset Dr. Rogers paves the way for his own positive teaching by a criticism of the form of Theism which passes current in ordinary theology and common-sense theories, as the semi-official philosophy of religion. This leaves us with " three distinct factors-material things, conscious beings, and as a third reality which creates and directs them, God ". Two difficulties are insisted on. The first is the unintelligible nature of the relation of matter to the Creative Spirit and to other spirits; the second is that on this view intelligence or design enters into</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 115 the world-process "only in the form of a distinct or supplementary power". i' Teleology only appears where mechanism breaks down." The difficulty concerning the nature and existence of matter is taken up in the next chapter, which deals with "Materialism and Subjective Idealism ". It is shown that these theories both embody truths which cannot be surrendered, and that at the same time they are in irreconcil- able antagonism if each is taken as a statement of absolute truth. The solution of the problems thus raised can only be solved by an investigation of the ultimate nature of knowledge and of its relation to reality. This leads to a chapter on " Rationalism and Sensationalism " followed up by a chapter on the attempted synthesis of these points of view in Kant and another on the developed Rationalism of Hegel. The treatment of Kant and Hegel is excellent both in regard to exposition and criti- cism. The vital points are brought into clear light, and all details which might confuse the beginner are ignored. After a chapter on "Agnosticism and the Theory of Knowledge," Dr. Rogers proceeds to develop what he takes to be the true Philosophy under the titles " Theistic Idealism " and "Scepticism and the Criterion of Truth ". The main point of this Philosophy is the emphasis laid on teleological unity. The type of the unity of the universe is the unity and continuity of our own con- scious striving towards the attainment of practical and theoretical ends. Dr. Rogers apologises for appearing to dogmatise by pleading the necessity of leaving a unified impression on the mind of the student. The apology was scarcely necessary. Dr. Rogers puts forward his own views as the result of an historical and critical survey of alternative theories which will enable the intelligent student to form a reasoned judg- ment for himself. In any case, the careful reading of this book will place him in a position from which he can proceed to the more detailed study of philosophy and of philosophical system to the greatest advantage. Dr. Rogers is to be congratulated on having condensed so much valuable matter within so small a compass. Compactness and lucidity are conspicuous merits of his work. EDITOR (G. F. S.). Studies from the Psychological Laboratory of Chicago. By JAMES Row- LAND ANGELL. Vol. ii., No. 2. University of Chicago Press, 1899. These studies include two short, provisional reports and four longer communications reprinted from the Psychological Review. The first short report is by Prof. Buck on the overestimation of vertical as com- pared with horizontal lines. The overestimation was found to be slightly increased by placing the observer on his side so that the head and eyes were at right angles to their usual position. This is rightly regarded as an argument against the explanation of the illusion by eye-movement. The subject is, however, complicated by the possibility of the existence of compensatory swivel rotation of the eyeballs in the recumbent position, a possibility which the author does not mention. The subject and method are worthy of further investigation. The second short communication is by Dr. D. P. MacMiller, "A Study in Habit," in which the influence of wearing a prism before one eye on the co-ordination of eye and head was studied. No mention is made of the similar experiments of Czermak and Helmholtz. Of the four reprints, the first is by Prof. Angell and Helen Bradford Thompson on the relations between certain organic processes and con- sciousness, in which a good critical account is given of previous work.</page><page sequence="3">116 NEW BOOKS. Experiments are then described, using the air-plethysmograph, which show mainly that the more intense and sudden is the stimulus, the more marked are the organic changes, and on the basis of this a theory is stated which refers the changes to the regularity or irregularity of the process of attention. No marked difference was found to distinguish the effects of pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. In a short paper on "Habit and Attention" Prof. Angell gives an account of some reaction-time experiments, which show that there is a tendency for the muscular and sensorial forms of reaction to approach one another with practice. The next paper is by Prof. Angell on the comparison of length as estimated by passive dermal stimulation with visual estimation. The normal underestimation of the former was found to be lessened, or even converted into overestimation by increase of pressure and by using hot or cold stimuli. Each of these factors was only studied on one individual. The last paper is by M. L. Ashley on the significance of intensity of light in visual estimates of depth. The special point was to investigate the influence of change of brightness apart from that of distinctness, although in some of the experiments the latter factor came into play. In the monocular and in some of the binocular experiments, the arrange- ment which was employed excluded any other factor than that of change in brightness and in these increase of brightness led to an appearance of nearness, decrease to one of farness; the change in brightness was seen as such earlier than the apparent change in distance. In other binocular experiments, the binocular mechanism was allowed to come into play, and even in these experiments alteration of illumination was found to have distinct influence though the results were more uncertain and more individual differences were met with. The author does not say whether he tested his observers for the presence of binocular vision. The paper is an important contribution to the difficult problem of estimation of depth, and adds another to the so-called " experience " factors which have to be excluded in studying the physiological factors in this process. In Dixon and Hillebrand's experiments on this subject the arrangement used was such, however, that the factor in question cannot have had any appreciable influence. W. H. R. R. Mad Humanity: Its Forms, Apparent and Obscure. By L. F. WINSLOW. New York: M. F. Mansfield &amp; Co., 1899. Pp. xix., 461. The title of this book leads us to expect a popular account of insanity, rather than a scientific treatise. And the author's style is for the most part anecdotal and reminiscential, though he appears also to have had his, serious purpose in writing. He believes that insanity is on the increase; that the degeneration of the human race is "in gradual and sad progres- sion "; and that much of this result is due to indulgence in alcohol. He further urges Lombroso's theory that genius is akin to insanity. But his. proof of this position consists merely in a list of geniuses who were more or less deranged: and one is tempted to inquire for the geniuses who were not insane. If genius is a form of madness, all geniuses should have been mad. Dr. Winslow writes from abundant personal experience, and his book may do the good he hopes for in enabling " some to detect the incipient progress of mental diseases ". It is well illustrated.</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 117 The Physical Nature of the Child and How to Study It. By S. H. ROWE. New York and London: The Macmillan Company, 1899. Pp. xiv., 207. Price, $1.00. This is essentially a practical book. The author describes simple tests, clinical, anthropometric and psychophysical, of the child's sight, hearing, other senses, motor ability, enunciation, nervousness, fatigue and habits of posture and of movement, and discusses the cognate topics of disease, growth and adolescence, and school and home conditions that affect the child's physical nature. The work should be useful; its occasional weak- ness in theory is more than offset by its generally sensible tone. Educational Aims and Educational Values. By P. H. HANUS. New York and London: The Macmillan Company, 1899. Pp. vii., 211. Price, $1.00. A series of eight essays, written with sound judgment but in a somewhat redundant style, upon contemporary educational problems. Chapters i.-v. attempt to formulate the aims of elementary and secondary education in America. " The aim of education is to prepare for complete living.... We have a common measure of educational value. Its factors are in- centives and power." The remaining chapters deal with the professional training of the college-bred teacher, and with the permanent influence of Comenius. La Dissolution. Par ANDRA LALANDE. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1899. Pp. 492. Price, 7 fr. 50. This volume is an attempt to show that the trend of progress is in the direction of homogeneity, as against Mr. Spencer's hypothesis of hetero- geneity. The proof is mainly positive, and rests on a comprehensive array of facts drawn from every sphere of life and thought: the a priori aspect of the problem is not emphasised, it being felt-and we may admit rightly felt-that the burden of proof on this side lies rather with the adversary. M. Lalande's argument is too diffuse to be summarised here: one can only indicate some of the positions which he takes up. Mr. Spencer's Law of Evolution-he would prefer the term Involution- he regards as no law, but only a bad definition, and the principle of the permanence of energy appears to him, as to so many others, only a variant of the law of causality. He believes, further, that the individual is an elementary and not a higher unity, and that accordingly the State is the antithesis of the organism; as to the development of mind he hints, following Rousseau, that life has lost all that reflexion has gained. In what Wundt calls the normative character of all rational action consists its advance towards homogeneity, in the ideals, namely, of truth, beauty, and goodness, which constitute the ground of objectivity in science, art, and morality. M. Lalande goes on to deplore the crude methods of anthropologists, who deduce arguments as to the infancy of the race from customs of effete and senile savagery, and imparts local colour to his work by predicting the dissolution of the family, and the ultimate triumph of the principles of the French Revolution. In con- clusion, he ridicules recent atteinpts to get beyond an anthropocentric teleology, and insists that in the order of nature death follows rather than precedes life, and that this being so death is an incontrovertible witness of dissolution. The error of this book is in its presentation of results. The evidence</page><page sequence="5">118 NEW BOOKS. adduced is overwhelming, but it is chaotic: the various threads of argument are not sufficiently gathered up and diseintangled at the close; and we fear that either the author's dread of heterogeneity or his keen sense of the peace-making mission of philosophy has led him to under- rate the controversial character of his work. As here presented M. Lalande's facts are only facts; hence the danger that M. Lalande's theory may remain only a theory. E. A. MENNEER. La Tristesse (ontenmporaine. Par H. FIERENS-GEVABRT. Paris: Felix Alean, 1899. Pp. iii., 195. This essay is a study of the depression which the consciousness of social disintegration seems to have so widely engendered in France. It starts with a chapter on " l'illusion scientifique," and after a rapid historical survey of the history of thought from the eighteenth century to the present day, concludes with a chapter on Nietzsche. The author's remiedy, how- ever, for the malady he describes is by no means easy to discover. He is full of sentimental hankerings after the old Catholic faith, and de- clares in his concluding chapter " I1 n'y a qu'tin seul remede, pensons-nous, i ce malaise: la croyance religieuse. Seule, la foi peut guerir le monde." Yet a page or so later he declares this remedy to be impossible, and to re- quire either a miraculous revival of the old religions or a new revelation, and gives as his final advice the command, "1 Aimons et agissos " (p. 190). What, we are not told; and as the attempt to discover its meaning might only add to contemporary sadness, we had best perhaps not pry into the pleasing vagueness of this dictum. The book is agreeably written, but this hardly justifies the daring disregard for dates which its combinations display. Thus Leopardi is represented as the founder of dogmatic pessimism (p. 56) and Schopenhauer as his successor (p. 62), while Napoleon (p. 39) is said to have been indispensable to the exist- ence of Goethe! But the most audacious passage of this sort is one which makes (p. 70) Bentham a disciple of Comte. Yet tradition will have it that Bentham was born fifty years before Comte and died seven years before the latter published his Cours de Philosophie Positive. L'Individu et la Reforme Sociale. Par EDOUARD SANZ Y. ESCARTIN. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1898. Pp. 390. This work is a translation from the Spanish and in the translator's preface we are given a short account of the writer. M. Escartin is it appears a very well-known and esteemed writer on social subjects among his fellow countrymen. The present volume is more in the nature of a collection of essays than of an organic whole. These essays cover a con- siderable field. Many of them are well mleaning rather than original or profound. The general object of the book is to show what individual action can do in solving the social difficulties which surround us. The author considers that the individual is the foundation of all permanent social reform. His general criticism of modern socialism is that it is incompatible with liberty. Liberty is bound up with the existence of private property and progress is impossible without liberty. M. Escartin considers that the true line of advance is to diffuse property among all sections of the population. It is the more general diffusion of property which will redeem the masses from the triple servitude of ignorance, moral degradation, and physical misery. M. Escartin also insists on the</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 119 fact that the social question is to a large extent a moral question. The miseries which afflict society are the resuilt of our passions, our greed, our want of solid convictions, the troubles of the heart and mind. Although a devout Catholic, M. Escartin maintains that morality is not necessarily supernatural in character. The ordinary sense of the word has its roots in the laws of individual and social life, in the nature of society and man: it is the indispensable condition of his harmonious development and activity. On the whole the book is an interesting pro- duct of modern Spain. If the author can succeed in impressing his ideas on his fellow countrymen, the Spaniards may yet have a future before them among the peoples of the west. Morale et Education. Par P. FILIX THOMAS. Paris: Felix Alcan. Pp. 171. This little book is made up of ten essays which have already appeared in various reviews, but which have enough in common to justify their author in issuing them in their present form. From the educational standpoint the book is disappointing. The final chapter, covering eighteen pages, is all that is specially devoted to education. It is true that in addition to this chapter on " The Teaching of Morality " we have occasional references to education throughout the book. These, how- ever, are mostly near the end of chapters, and are rather suggestive of afterthoughts. Of the purely ethical matter there is little that is new. On the other hand, the arrangement of the book is excellent. The style is eminently clear and finished, and if the book is intended for the use of teachers who are not assumed to have any special training in ethics it is eminently suited for its purpose. The various theories of morality are very clearly stated and admirably illustrated. No doubt M. Thomas assumes that his readers can make the educational applications for them- selves if only he provides them, as he does, with an up-to-date statement of the position of the various ethical schools. The chapter on Indi- vidualism is very striking in its treatment of modern tendencies in France, the section on lefonctionnarisme being specially refreshing. Le 1?egime Socialiste. Par GEORGEs RFNARD. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1898. Pp. 186. M. Renard is a professor in the University of Lausanne and has a con- siderable literary reputation. In this sketch of the political and economic organisation of society Prof. Renard has contrived to put his ideas before the public with great skill and lucidity. It is an excellently written little book. He looks at the social question from two points of view, political and economic; and he attempts to show how the political and economic condition of society may be transformed by the application of certain general principles which are set forth in the first part of his book. These general principles are of two kinds-scientific and moral. The scientific principles are the laws of social evolution. All social pro- gress must move along the lines marked out by these laws. The moral principles are, that every one should have free scope to develop his personal aptitudes and should be permitted to profit by the chances of happiness which nature has given him. On this basis M. Renard tries to construct a system which will reconcile justice and utility, individual liberty and a rational organisation of society.</page><page sequence="7">120 NEW BOOKS. Psychologie der Axiome. Von Dr. JULIUS SCHULZ. Gottingen: Vanden- hoeck und Ruprecht, 1899. Pp. 232. The present work has few merits except a lively and amusing style, and a clear statement of the views which it advocates. Since axioms must be defined by a logical criterion, the subject invites to confusions between logic and psychology; and the author does not refuse the invitation. The work should treat either of all that has psychologically held an axiomatic position, and of the causes of past and present opinions on the subject, or of the state of mind involved in correct views on axioms, in which case the most difficult inquiry would be the logical one as to what axioms are. The author, however, confuses the two inquiries, attempts both, and succeeds in neither. Dr. Schulz's general position may be described as Kantianism modified by Sigwart. An inquiry into axioms is concerned with the forms of intuition and thought, which are purely subjective, and independent of the stimulus. Axioms are neither analytic nor synthetic; they are, in fact, not propositions, but postulates, innate habits of the soul, at least in man. At bottom, they depend upon the will; a pure intuition is not a describable object, but (!) an activity of the subject. To understand anything is to anthropomorphise it (i.e., we might add, to pretend it is something else). What the world is in itself, we cannot tell, nor even whether Being has any objective meaning (a point, one would have thought, establiphed even by Descartes' cogito). Not sensation, but association-which is always at bottom association by contiguity-is the beginning of psychical life, and the source of the principles of experience, prior even to the law of identity. This law and that of uniformity both demand comparison, and this consists of two parts: first we feel an experience to be familiar, and then the element with which comparison is to be made can be reproduced. The author inquires at length into the stage of evolution at which animals begin to think in accordance with the various postulates, and tells so many tales of their intelligence as nearly to persuade us of the paradox of Rorarius. Self-consciousness, we are told, distinguishes men from animals, and is the psychological source of the idea of substance (though the author agrees with Kant that, metaphysically, substance is not applicable to the Ego). Our acts suggest the substitution of causality for mere succession; motions appear not merely to follow volitions, but to follow necessarily from them. Controversies as to the nature of cause have an anthropomorphic origin: if I say I move my limbs, substance is the cause, its own motion is the effect; if I move other bodies, one substance is the cause of motion in another; if my motion moves other bodies, cause and effect are alike events. All three views seem plausible to crude anthropomorphism, and the third is preferred only because it is more convenient in science. Both substance and cause, says our author, are applied to the material world only by anthropomorphism ; nevertheless he insists that they must be applied. Matter is defined by three attributes, extension, motion, and impenetrability. Abstracting from the last two, we get the subject-matter of Geometry. (It is difficult to see how two immovable extensions can fail to be impenetrable, and no explanation is offered.) Abstracting extension too, and leaving only what is common to the psychical and physical, we are left with the thinkable simply, which gives us number. The author proceeds to discuss Arithmetic, Geometry and Mechanics. The account of number agrees in the main with Sigwart. It ignores modern Arithmetic by permitting geometrical arguments on fundamental points, e.g., multiplication and irrationals. The remarks</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 121 on Geometry are a farrago of logical fallacies, historical blunders, and mathematical errors, culminating in a pretended proof of the axiom of parallels. The discussion of Mechanics is malnly directed against Mach, and insists on the necessity of absolute motion, which the author, like Leibniz, deduces by means of causality. He fails, however, to under- stand the consequences of absolute motion, since he asserts, contrary to received Dynamics, that two particles alone in the world would have to move in the straight line joining them. Atomism is regarded as a priori necessary, and action at a distance as unavoidable, though the latter, it is confessed, cannot be anthropomnorphised. Vortex atoms are dismissed with the single remark that they are the maddest imagina- tion since the time of the Vedas (p. 104), and no arguments are to be found against a plenum. The law of inertia is deduced from the prin- ciple that every change is to have a cause; with Heymans, experience is allowed to decide whether the principle is to apply to change of place or change of velocity. It is not realised that both, if the principle be sound, require causes, and that, if one may be uncaused, so may the other. The book, though it has some good sections, shows, despite violent partisanship, an almost total lack of real argument on controverted points. It also illustrates the fact that philosophers subsequent to Kant, in writing on mathematics, have thought it unnecessary to become acquainted with the subjects they were discussing, and have therefore left to the painful and often crude efforts of mathematicians every genuine advance in mathematical philosophy. B. RUSSELL. Die Moderne Physiologische Psychologie in Deutschland. Eine historisch- kritische Untersuchung mit besonderer Beriicksichtigung des Problems der A ufmerksamkeit. Von W. HEINRICH. Zweite teilweise umgear- beitete und vergrosserte Ausgabe. Zurich: E. Speidel, 1899; Lon- don: Williams &amp; Norgate. Pp. viii., 249. Price 4s. net. Zur Prinzipienfrage der Psychologie. Von W. HEINRICH. Zurich: E. Speidel, 1899; London: Williams &amp; Norgate. Pp. vi., 74. Price 2s. net. Heinrich's position, as developed in his Prinzipienfraqe, may be summed up as follows. For scientific purposes we must regard the world as a manifold whose parts are qualitatively differentiated. A naive realism is the only justifiable presupposition. Hence we must exclude from our point of view derived notions such as those of mass, energy and con- sciousness. All there is to consider (here, as in other places, Heinrich closely follows Avenarius) is the individual, his fellow-men and their utterances, and his complex environment. The strictly scientific method is descriptive, and never goes behind the facts for an explanation. Psy- chology, accordingly, does not aim at deciphering man's consciousness. Its special task is to investigate the attitude of the individual in relation to his fellow-men and to his environment. With this end in view it takes cognisance only of the interaction between the individual, physio- logically considered, and his environment; and that because in the ob- jective world alone can the law of causation be rigidly and usefully applied. Hence those theories which imply an introspective basis, or introduce a subjective factor, should be dismissed as weak, if not as self- contradictory. Between the individual and the environment we must assume the existence of a complete chain of physical sequence, unin- terrupted by any psychic links. Many of Heinrich's arguments in</page><page sequence="9">122 NEW BOOKS. favour of an objective psychology and against the interconnexion between the mental and the material are forcible, though not always convincing. Yet it is a pity that he should be almost uniformly speculative. He de- cides against the possibility of systematic introspection; he assumes a sharp cleavage between mental and material; he accepts the world as it appears to him as final; but he fails to support these crucial assump- tions, knowing apparently nothing of the contentions of James and Fouillee respecting the last two propositions. Heinrich's larger work is a survey of German physiological psychology from the standpoint described in the preceding paragraph. He examines in turn Herbart, Fechner, G. E. Muller, Wundt, Kiulpe, Miinsterberg, Ziehen, Avenarius, and a few other writers. French psychologists are represented by Descartes and Ribot, while England and America are un- represented. His chief attack is directed against the introduction of subjective factors in experimental psychology. He endeavours to show that sensations cannot be measured, and that figures referring to " con- scious " activity, as in association experiments, are untrustworthy and barren. Against Wundt and others he argues powerfully and at some length that the physical series is at no stage determined by desire, or pleasure, or any psychic factor. He holds that the physical sequence is the primary one, whilst the mental sequence is dependent and secondary. He rules out mental activity, and hence his special discussion of the problem of attention, connected as that is by many thinkers with such activity. Lack of positive support for far-reaching statements is our author's fault in this volume as in the one already referred to. His theory of attention, in spite of profuse criticisms of other writers, con- sists but of a vague suspicion that sensory accommodation is the sole factor in sensory attention. His description of the mental as embodying " our wishes, experiences, resolutions, hopes, desires, volitions, etc., etc."-always carefully omitting, as he does, references to sensations and images-is most unsatisfactory as a definition. His disparagement of introspective methods, without bringing forward proof of their insuffi- ciency, makes us doubt whether he has given them a fair trial. Nor does his tacit agreement with the quantitative school satisfy us that he is on the royal road to the solution of psychological questions. How- ever, Heinrich urges with force an important point, i.e., that psycholo- gists should well consider the inexpediency of dealing with a series which contains both physical and psychic factors, and the advantage of rigidly separating the two classes. GUSTAV SPILLER. Worterbuch der Philosophischen Begriffe und Ausdriicke. By RUDOLPH EISLER. Lieferungen, i-viii. Berlin: Mittler au Sohn, 1899. Pp. 800. In this Dictionary Dr. Eisler renders good service to philosophical students. The work is now in its seventh part. It is executed on a very restricted plan, and should be estimated only for what it attempts. To criticise the plan first, we find the word Worterbuch altogether too broad for a work of this character. It is in strictness a collation of sentences more or less of the character of definitions- sometimes very far from such-from ancient and modern writers collected under headings and put in alphabetical order. It attempts no authoritative definition of its own, makes no effort to sum up opinions, gives no discrimination of good authors from bad and often quite omits the best. It has no deri- vations (as such), no equivalents in other languages, no discrimination</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 123 among so called synonyms. This is of course a " Dictionary "-but not what one expects in these days of lexicographical specialising. As to its execution: Dr. Eisler's limitations are very evident. He has gone through many works, marking and copying pregnant sentences on this topic and that; but his reading is mainly, almost entirely, German. Of English authors he cites works which have been translated into German-or which are cited by German authors he has consulted. For example, Bain and Spencer are quoted-the rest not! As to living writers, the result is surprising. For example, under the psychological headings I find James's name twice-no doubt a more diligent search would discover it twice again-and in one of these references, James is put down with Bain, as a Vertreter of Associationism ! Now it is simply inexcusable for any man in these days to call himself educated in philosophy who cannot read the three great languages of literary Europe ; and to publish a work of a historical character on phitosophische Grqund- begriffr under such a limitation is to invite unsparing criticism. Again, the citations are of every degree of value from boiling down to zero. Some are detached sentences, worse than worthless separated from their context. Others are merely descriptive remarks not intended by the writer as definitions at all. All these are printed side by side, and the student finds himself "rich in the riches of confusion ". Moreover, certain favourite writers (notably Wundt) are cited everywhere from Alpha to Omega. Yet the service of the book remains. In the hands of the philosophi- cal expert it serves a double purpose. It brings to his door many good things which he would otherwise have to spend many hours in seeking. And better-it presents, on the whole, under some of the main topics, data for a general view of the progress of a conception in history as em- bodied in quotations from the leading philosophers. But the student shouild beware of being misled by its single citations. In the references a high degree of accuracy has been attained, and the publishers' work is all that could be desired. Furthermore, the list of terms seenms fairly exhaustive for philosophy proper-not for experi- mental psychology however-and some English terms are included, yet without sufficient indication-especially in case of Latin forms, e.g. 'emotion '-as to whether or not the same form is used in German. J. MARK BALDWIN. Aristoteles. Von. H. SIEBECK (Frommanns Klassiker der Philosophie, No. 8.) Stuttgart: Fr. Frommann, 1899. Pp. 142. This excellent little account of the greatest of ancient philosophies deserves to be widely known in England, where there is a curious dearth of works upon the principles of Aristotelianism as distinguiished from monographs upon special points. Teachers who have to lecture upon the History of Ancient Philosophy will find Herr Siebeck's clear and concise presentation of the main doctrines of Peripateticism exceedingly useful for their own special purposes, and it may also be put with great profit into the hands of their more intelligent pupils; for the dullards its very conciseness will probably make it a little too difficult. It is no disparagement of a work of long-proved merit to say that Siebeck's book will be all the more welcome among us that it is written from another point of view than the well-known "c Outlines " of the late Edwin Wallace, and seeks to measure Aristotelianism by comparison more with modern natural science than with later idealistic metaphysics. The brilliant account of Aristotle's metaphysical principles and their physical</page><page sequence="11">124 NEW BOOKS. application seems to us to call for especial praise. This singularly difficult subject has, perhaps, never been more successfully handled in a popular style. On the other hand, we might have wished for a more adequate account of the Aristotelian theory of method than that given at pp. 113-18. And in the chapter on Ethics the author certainly seems to exaggerate the difference between Aristotle and Plato. It is scarcely just to the author of the Republic to represent him as regarding this life merely or mainly as a preparation for the next. Possibly again too much is made of Aristotle's own preference for a " contemplative " life. After all, Aristotle cannot be said to present the 3tos 0E6XpJTLKdS as the one ideal for all mankind. A. E. T. Einleitung in die Philosophie. Von Prof. Dr. WILHELM JERUSALEM. Wien und Leipzig: Wilhelm Braunmiller. Pp. vi., 189. An extremely well-written little book. It deals from the author's dis- tinctive stand-point with the whole range of philosophical problems, treating successively of the nature and function of Philosophy, of the method and scope of the various philosophical disciplines, of Epistem- ology, of Ontology, of ZEsthetics, and of Ethics and Sociology. The author belongs to the rapidly increasing group of thinkers who found Philosophy on Psychology. In particular a certain psychological theory of the nature of Judgment dominates his whole work. The essence of all Judgments consists, according to Dr. Jerusalem, in " reference to a centre of force," which is ultimately founded in the immediate experience of voluntary movement. We interpret our sense experience as implying the existence of wills other than our own, and in so doing we become aware of external things as substances and causes. In the treatment of .,Esthetics Prof. Jerusalem advocates a play-theory. He regards artistic activity as an exercise of energies which are not called into action in the practical business of life. He finds the basis of morality in the essentially social nature of man and not in any a priori law. The author's own peculiar views are more obtrusively advocated than they oiight to be in a work of this sort. But the book has many merits, and in particular it is distinguished by a rare lucidity of style and arrangement. Rosmini e Spencer. Studio espositivo-critico di Filosofia Morale. IDel Prof. GIoVANNI VIDARI. Milano, 1899. Pp. xiii., 297. This volume is a successful prize essay. In 1894 the commission appointed to bestow what is known in Italy as the 'premio Ravizza' gave as the subject of competition for that and the following year 'an exposition of the moral principles of the traditional or spiritualistic school (Rosmini, etc.), and of the positivist or materialist school (Spencer, etc.) '; and last February the prize was unanimously adjudicated to the work of Prof. Vidari of Sondrio. It is in some respects a highly creditable performance. To begin with, the method is eminently philosophical. After a general introduction in -which the relations of the two representative thinkers to their respective ages are briefly indicated, we are given a detailed exposftion of Rosmini's ethics, followed by a critical section, which again falls into two divisions, the first dealing with the system under discussion as a product of personal and historical factors, while in the second it is considered as a pure theory in reference to the demands of logic. An equal space is then devoted to</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 125 an analysis of Mr. Spencer's system conducted on the same lines; and the whole concludes with a general survey of the present position and prospects of ethical science. The expository portions of the essay also, deserve high praise. If the account of Rosmini's system leaves some- thing to be desired in point of clearness, we may safely assume that the fault lies with the inherent confusion of the original rather than with the interpretation of Prof. Vidari. The summary of Mr. Spencer's ethics, though not coveringf a sufficiently wide area, is, so far as it goes, remark- ably luminous and precise. But the author is less happy when he ventures. on the difficult task of historical deduction and construction. According to his view Europe-with the exception, as is hinted, of England-was from 1815 to 1845 under the dominion of a spiritualistic and religious movement, most adequately represented by Rosmini. To this succeeded another current of ideas, ' derived perhaps from England,' fed with the discoveries of physical science, opposed to revealed religion, positivist and materialist in its tendencies, represented by Herbert Spencer. Finally, during the last years of the century, we have a reaction against evolutionary monism combined with a more purely scientific way of looking at facts. The time has not come for a definite characterisation of contemporary tendencies; but surely Prof. Vidari takes far too limited a view of European thought from 1830 to 1845. Much the greater part of Hegel's teaching, the whole activity of the Hegelian Left, and the whole of Comte's Philosophie Positive fall within that period, while the anti- clerical revolution of 1830 forms its exact central point. The author may claim Hegel as an idealist; but no thinker was ever more rationalistic or more opposed to such transcendental ethics as Rosmini's. Again, in politics that period was dominated by the idea of nationality, for which Rosmini had no sort of liking, but rather the reverse. In truth this philosopher, so revered by his countrymen, had no European position; he only represented a group of amiable Italians who dreamed of recon- ciling the Papacy with the demands of modern civilisation. There was no doubt something remarkable about a nineteenth century metaphysician who tried to harmonise Roman Catholic theology with reason, and the Roman theocracy with individual liberty and religious toleration; but to place him by Mr. Spencer is grotesque. Rosmini was rather an Italian Coleridge, without Coleridge's literary genius, but with far more power of systematic application. Both received a considerable stimulus from German idealism, but rather as a solvent of eighteenth century sensism than as a source of positive truth. And just as Coleridge was thrown back by his German studies on the old Anglican divines, so Rosmini was thrown back on the early Fathers, whose philosophy, itself derived from the later schools of Greece, he attempted to furbish up for modern require- ments. The result was a series of verbal quibbles, which there is the less need to expose inasmuch as their fragile texture has been torn to pieces by Prof. Vidari in his theoretical criticism. In tracing the antecedents of Spencerianism the author says much that is true, if rather obvious, but on the whole he is greatly hampered by ignorance both of things English and also, to a great extent, of Mr. Spencer's writings. That philosophy which he depicts as the natural out- come of triumphant middle-class ideas ran counter to formidable pre- judices. Whatever may be the sentiments of the continental bourgeoisie, our middle class from 1840 to 1860 did not make pleasure the principle of moral good (p. 195); nor is it true that it paid no heed to the 'moans and murmurs' of the lower classes. The condition of the people, as we can tell by early Victorian literature, attracted no less attention then than now and was discussed with equal ardour. It was also a subject in</page><page sequence="13">126 NEW BOOKS. which Mr. Spencer was particularly interested, having become familiarised when still a youth with the practical working of the English Poor Law, both old and new. If he rejects Socialism it is from no indifference to the lot of the working classes, but because he sincerely believes that their position would be made worse by the substitution of collectivism for competition. And so far from feeling satisfaction with the actual state of society he was led by the passion for reform to work out the whole theory of evolution. For Prof. Vidari is quite mistaken in assuming that this theory arose from the spontaneous development of physical science, or that it was something that Mr. Spencer picked up by the way and fitted tant bien que mal to his utilitarian ethics. It was rather a sucker thrown out from the ethical theory which in turn became a support to the parent trunk. The theoretical criticism of Mr. Spencer's ethics is largely vitiated by an assumption for which the authorities who set the subject of competi- tion for the 'premio Ravizza' are primarily responsible. In obedience to the terms employed by those gentlemen the epithet materialistic, although repeatedly disclaimed by Mr. Spencer, is throughout these pages applied to his teaching. Merely as a question of courtesy people should not be called by names to which they object unless grave reasons for so doing can be given. Nor is the question merely verbal. Misuse of words leads to misstatements about facts. Prof. Vidari represents Mr. Spencer as saying that ' Force is no other than the subjective correlative of Matter' (p. 185)-and this in complete forgetfulness of an earlier passage in his own exposition where the objectivity assigned to Force in First Principles is perfectly recognised (p. 164). Another time, and again in direct contradiction to his own exposition, he charges Mr. Spencer with denying any active efficacy to thought, feeling, and will. Finally when Mr. Spencer claims to have established in opposition to the empiricism of the older utilitarians a necessarily causal relation between certain courses of action and the production of pleasure and pain, this is in- terpreted to mean that morality results from a process of unconscious evolution ultimately dependent on the persistence of force. Prof. Vidari denies, on the authority of Wundt, that force persists, the law of the con- servation of energy being inapplicable to mental action (p. 210), and expatiates at length on the importance of consciousness in morality. He has of course a right to think wnat he likes about force; but his criticisms are irrelevant. What Mr. Spencer says in this connexion about conduct and causation does not refer to the ultimate derivation of human activity from the forces of nature, but to the necessary effect of certain courses of action, consciously carried on, in increasing or diminishing the sum of human pleasures and pains. The whole discussion moves on the ground of conscious life; and there is nothing essential to the method or the conclusions that a believer in free-will, as such, might not accept. For the rest Prof. Vidari disputes Mr. Spencer's positions at every point. He denies that pleasure is the final good; that the felicific effect of actions can be calculated; that the good are more adapted to the social environment than the bad; that the survival of the fittest is conducive to morality; that acquired moral habits are inherited; that the feeling of obligation is destined to disappear in a perfect society. But as there is nothing original about his objections they cannot be noticed here. When the essayist attempts to be original he becomes confused. The errors of moral philosophers are due, he thinks, to their not sufficiently distinguishing between the science of morality and morality itself. According to his view instead of telling us what we ought to do they</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 127 should confine themselves to describing and analysing the facts of moral consciousness as exhibited in all countries and at all times. Above all they should keep clear of contemporary interests and not let themselves be influenced by the spirit of the age. On this principle Pasteur should have left the cure of disease severely alone. Yet, oddly enough,' science helps to constitute morality and life and to direct them along new paths' (p. 121). But its principal duty is to register the foregone conclusions of a certain school, and to play into the hands of theology. It must recognise the feeling of obligation, that is of a superior force imposing itself on us, as an ultimate fact that it cannot explain. And it must also recognise a necessary relation between the fulfilment of the Ideal, which is an objectivation of that force (whatever that may mean) and the complete satisfaction of life, that is happiness (p. 119). As usual with the anti-hedonists, personal happiness is after all the supreme end. Else- where we learn that 'our ignorance of the force whence obligation proceeds is the very thing that makes its incessant action possible' (p. 245). But at any rate we know that it is rather changeable, since it has been ' objectivated ' in all the ideals ever set up by human beings (ib.). The real object of this ethical agnosticism is to leave a vacuum for faith to fill up (p. 295). 'The foundation of morality must be sought in God,' but apparently one God will answer the purpose as well as an- other (p. 296). Prof. Vidari fancies that he speaks for science; in reality he only speaks for a particularly feeble and sterile form of reactionary thought. ALFRED W. BENN. La psicogenesi dello istinto e della morale secondo C. Darwin. Di PIETRO SCIASCIA. Palermo, 1899. Pp. xii., 178. Darwin when he traced back the descent of man to a lower animal found himself confronted by the difficulty of accounting for the intellectual and moral faculties which have long been regarded as what chiefly distin- guishes him from the brutes. He explained the growth of reason by the use of language, and language as evolved out of animal cries. And he accounted for conscience by the instinct of sociality common to all gregarious animals combined with the sympathy to which that instinct in its higher development leads. Signor Sciascia, who writes as a disciple of M. Fouillee, combats this position. His arguments are not very methodically stated, nor is it very easy to follow them. His exposition of Darwin's theory is lucid and interesting; but the polemical sections of his essay resemble the contents of a disorderly notebook. Nor does their scientific value make up for their literary deficiencies. Misconceptions and inconsistencies abound, and too often assertions and quotations do duty for facts and reasonings. The leading points seem to be as follows: Instincts cannot be acquired by individual experience, nor can they be transmitted by inheritance, because the animal could not begin to live without them, and because they cannot be embodied in the nervous structures. They result apparently from an immaterial principle by virtue of which the living creature, when it comes into contact with the external world, has an intuition of the means for attaining its ends, a process however which passes below the threshold of consciousness (pp. 66, 73). It is not stated whether this remarkable power is shared by plants-whether, for example, sempervivum arachnoideum has an intuition of the means for catching insects before spinning its web. We may observe that the intuition called into play by contadt with reality</page><page sequence="15">128 NEW BOOKS. relates to things that do not exist, being first created by the animal itself. Darwin nmay be wrong, but his explanation if correct would be an addition to our knowledge; his critic explains nothing, he merely gives a paraphrastic description of the facts to be accounted for. As applied to morality, however, instinct stands for something very much less complicated than the elaborate contrivances by which certain animals provide for their own and for their offspring's sustenance, and sometbing also much easier to explain. Our author occasionally speaks as if Darwin and his followers supposed that human beings came into the world with a complete code of morality organised in their nervous systems, and as if this code had been built up by natural selection and acquired habit without the intervention of reason. If so they would have pledged themselves to a gratuitous absurdity. The thing to be explained is how disinterested actions come to be performed. Given a primary root of self-devotion, intelligence may be trusted to elaborate it into the loftiest ethical system ever known. Without that element reason can do no more than machinery without propulsive force. Now Darwin finds this element in sociality and sympathy, qualities shared by us with some of the lower animals. The members of a flock like being together and are distressed by prolonged isolation. Call this tendency an instinct or an impulse, there seems no reason why it should not be correlated with certain nervous structures and transmiitted by inheritance to offspring. At any rate those who deny the assumption are bound to account for the general correlation of consciousness with a nervous system and for the established facts of mental heredity-points not discussed by the author. In the next place sociality leads to sympathy, or perhaps it would be 'safer to say synergy., Gregarious animnals co- operate for a commion end, and occasionally defend each other against attack, even at the risk of their lives. And here Darwinism comes into relation with utilitarianism. If right actions are those which either directly promote pleasure, or indirectly contribute to it, by maintaining the vital and social conditions of its existence, and contrariwise with pain, then morality, so far from contradicting evolution, is just what we should expect as its result. Signor Sciascia, on the other hand, holds that true morality is not utilitarian, and that Darwin's theory will not account for it. A good deal of the discussion turns on the implications of sympathy. It may at once be admitted that Darwin was not a psychological expert, and that something has been learned since he wrote. It seems unlikely that when one animal defends another against attack, or when a child in arms defends its nurse (as I have seen one do) the action is caused by a representative image of painful consequences. Creatures living together imitate one another, and to imitate the behaviour of the party attacked would often mean to join in repelling the aggressor. However this may be-and it is a point on which the author does not enter-in the higher stages of consciousness the pains and pleasures of others are sympathetic- ally felt in the full sense of the word, and become motives to action just like the original pains and pleasures of the agent himself. Here, according to utilitarian psychology, is the genesis of disinterested action; and here, according to Darwin, is the connecting link between animal sociability and human morality. Signor Sciascia, on the other hand, urges that such disinterestedness is a veiled egoism, and that to be actuated by a regard for one's own feelings cannot be truly moral. This, however, is to confound the intention with the motive of action. It is asserted by the theory impugned that all wills alike are determined at the moment of resolution by the greatest traction of pleasure combined with the least</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. 129 resistance of pain, and that is the motive of action; whereas its intention may be to secure the future happiness of the agent at the expense of others, whieh is egoism, or the future happiness of others at the expense of his own, which is altruism. And it is further asserted that in the up- ward march of evolution, the progress of organic adaptation, the mechanism of individual character becomes so adjusted that the idea of disinterested action tends to be associated with the most pleasurable, and that of its dereliction with the most painful, feelings, so that the race which pro- duces the most Picquarts and the fewest Merciers is bound in the long run to win. After these explanations it is needless to argue the question, for the author makes a number of scattered admissions which taken together give his case completely away. 'Egoism,' he justly observes, 'only arises when one's.own profit is sought to the loss of others' (p. 105). 'He who wished to secure the triumph of his own personality to the loss of that of others would not even secure individual happiness' (p. 132). ' The power of sympathy or of the disinterested impulses enters as an element into the moral sentiment' (p. 139). 'Primitive societies could not have been perpetuated without the idea and the practice of justice' (p. 149). ' In man the representation of man awakens by hereditary dis- position a particular pleasure, a tendency to give mutual help, to put others in one's own place' [Qu., oneself in the place of others?] (p. 159). 'Certain special psychical dispositions towards well-doing have been formed by heredity '(ib.). 'In the struggle for existence the victory will not be with those who possess marked physiological strength, but with those who join with power of intellect and feeling an energetic will and a well-developed social psychismn' (p. 176). If Signor Sciascia could be brought to see that a physiological founda- tion is necessary to the existence of these admirable qualities, and if he could be disabused of the error that Darwinian moralists ignore intelli- gence and morality as factors of evolution, there would be little or nothing to separate his philosophy from theirs.
