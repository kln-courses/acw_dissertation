TEACHER CLARITY and its effects on student achievement were investigated by Smith in a study of high school social studies students. Dividing students into eight groups defined according to possible combinations of two teacher uncertainty conditions, two teacher "bluffing" conditions, and two lecture notes conditions, the author found that teacher uncertainty reduced achievement significantly, and affected student evaluations of lesson materials. COOPERATIVE LEARNING and its relation to cross-ethnic classroom relations among students were studied by Johnson, Johnson, Tiffany, and Zaidman using 51 fourth-grade students. Assigning students to either an intergroup cooperation condition or an intergroup competition condition, the authors of the study found that the intergroup cooperation condition produced increased numbers of cross-ethnic relationships. DISCOVERY AND EXPOSITORY LEARNING were compared by Andrews in a study of independent and depen dent learners. Using a pre-post format involving the learning of basic chemistry concepts, the author found that discovery learning was superior for both groups of students, with independent students performing significantly bet ter than dependent students using discovery learning. EARLY READING achievement measures were examined by Swanson and Mason in a rural first-grade setting. Six recently developed tests of abilities and/or attitudes related to early reading achievement were administered to the sample population, with scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Test being used as criterion measure of the predic tive power of the six tests. The effectiveness of the tests, and their value compared to traditional measures of early reading achievement, is discussed. HOMEWORK and homework strategies were investigated by Paschal, Weinberg, and Walberg in a quantitative syn thesis of empirical studies. Using 15 studies with explicit statistical results, 54 characteristics of treatments, contexts, conditions, validity, and outcomes were coded. Results showed that approximately 85% of the effect sizes favored homework groups. ANTHROPOMORPHISM as a cue in word learning was studied by Blanchard and McNinch in trials to criterion and word memory tasks with kindergarten children. Employing similar and dissimilar words with anthropomorphic cues, the authors found training with anthropomorphic cues led to enhanced learning and retention. TAKE-HOME EXAMS were compared with in-class exams in a study by Marsh. Giving two groups of university students in-class or take-home tests and administering an unannounced posttest and a questionnaire measuring the first three levels of Bloom's Hierarchy of Cognitive Learning, the author found students in the in-class test group at tained significantly higher learning performances. MAIN IDEA INSTRUCTION in high school minority students was assessed by Sjostrum and Hare. The authors used systematic instruction techniques from the literature with a group of students, comparing them with a control group receiving instruction in vocabulary development. While students receiving main idea instruction performed better at identifying explicit and main ideas in paragraphs, and at restating and summarizing, their general comprehension performance was not improved. QUESTION-RESPONSE-FEEDBACK interactions in the classroom were explored by Mangano and Benton in fourth grade classrooms. Their study resulted in the generation of four hypotheses for future research: (1) effective ques tioning tends to focus on depth rather than breadth of response; (2) effective questioning is explicit and precise rather than vague; (3) explicit questioning is cohesive; and (4) effective questioners clarify misconceptions following an in correct response.

Special consideration is given to articles that focus on variables that can be manipulated in educational settings. All varieties of research are con sidered?experiments, evaluations, ethnography, replications, etc. Rigorous assessments of the validities of claims for products, testing materials, and educa tional practices are of particular interest. The editors invite essays dealing with issues that have been raised in the JER. 1. Contributors should submit two copies of each manuscript to be considered for publication. In addi tion, the author should keep an exact copy so the editors can refer to specific pages and lines if a question arises. The manuscript should be double-spaced with wide margins. 2. Each manuscript must be accompanied by an abstract of about 100 words. It should precede the text and include brief statements of the problem, the method, the data, and conclusions. In the case of a manuscript commenting on an article previously published in the JER, the abstract should state the topics covered and central thesis. 3. The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 3rd ed., the American Psychological Association, 1983, should be used as a style reference in preparation of manuscripts. 4. Reproductions of figures (graphs and charts) may be submitted for review purposes, but the originals must be supplied if the manuscript is accepted for publication. Tables should be prepared and captioned exactly as they are to appear in the journal. 5. Avoid explanatory notes whenever possible by incor porating their content in the text. For essential notes, identify them with consecutive superscripts and list them in a section entitled Notes at the end of the text. 6. Accepted manuscripts are normally published within six months of acceptance. Each author receives two complimentary copies of the issue in which his or her article appears and permission to reproduce additional copies of that article. Reprints are also available through the JER. 7.
