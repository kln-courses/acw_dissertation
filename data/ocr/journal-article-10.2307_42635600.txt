<plain_text><page sequence="1">Extrême-Orient, Extrême-Occident 21 - 1999 Severity and lenience : Divination and law in early imperial China Mark Csikszentmihalyi 1 The Qin legal code indicates that practitioners of law and divination occupied separate spheres. When diviners ( bu ) are mentioned in the Qin statutes found at Shuihudi near Yunmeng in Hubei Province, it is as a subclass of convicts, subject to having their beards shaved and exempted from hard labor to work as bond servants in the offices they once occupied 2. As far as may be determined, divination practice itself was not regularly subject to legal regulation or consumer protection standards, nor were diviners employed by the local administrators charged with applying laws to maintain public order. While the administration of justice and divination were not linked in the legal code itself, this does not mean the practices themselves were unconnected. One connection is suggested by the proximity of the legal texts to the Books of Days ( rishu ) prognostication texts also found at Shuihudi. Another similarity is that both the provisions of a uniform legal code and the entries in manuals used to interpret divination results were related by the necessity that they be interpreted to be applied to specific cases. One artifact of today's reliance on written records to understand divination and law in early China is that while many legal statutes and manuals for reading signs are extant, information on the administration of justice and methods of interpreting the manuals is sparse. This article will attempt to draw on diverse sources to compare the interpretive aspect of these practices. In order to make such a comparison, it will be useful to borrow a distinction from an anthropological context. The distinction between the technical (or technological) and the performative (or rhetorical) aspects of magic drawn by Stanley J. Tambiah will allow us to differentiate the part of a practice that imitates « the logic of technical/technological action » and the aspect that is « transparently rhetorical and performative » 3. Taking a modern visit to the doctor as an example, the doctor's craft consists of a number of technical aspects (e.g., visual examination, palpation, measuring blood pressure) followed by a rhetorical aspect (an interpretation consisting of diagnosis and advice or prescription.) The technical aspect exists to categorize and label the patient's condition at a given time, while the rhetorical aspect has a normative dimension that relates where the patient is to where the patient ought to be. In terms of</page><page sequence="2">Mark Csikszentmihalyi the legal process, the technical phase would be the procedure by which a set of actions are matched to a particular legal statute (if one indeed applies.) In divination according to the Classic of Changes ( Yîjing ), the technical phase would be the casting of milfoil stalks and the lengthy process of calculating the applicable hexagram or hexagrams. Just as a doctor might tell a patient to finally quit smoking regardless of what was learned in the examination, however, the rhetorical phase of a practice requires the performer to do more than pass along raw data, and involves the performer's use of judgment. Judges in a legal proceeding may take extenuating circumstances into account during the sentencing phase of a trial, and experts in casting the stalks may use clues about the circumstances of clients into account when making their readings 4. Whatever the relationship between the technical procedures in the application of law and divination in early imperial China, their performance relied on a shared vocabulary that derived from a common picture of the nature of a performer's judgment. This examination of the role of interpretation in law and divination in early imperial China begins with an examination of debates over interpretation in both areas, specifically over whether the outcome of the technical process was absolute or contingent. In early China, there were writers who believed that sentencing should not be effected by exigencies, and that the rhetorical aspect of the administration of justice should be entirely determined by the technical aspect. Similarly, in divination, many writers militate against what must have been a popular view that fate was entirely determined by the casting of milfoil stalks, and that there was no room for a person to change his or her future, a view that again signalled a triumph of the technical over the rhetorical. Both these absolutist positions were vociferously opposed by those who felt that there was room for interpretation of the technical results, and that the performer's judgment had to play a role. By the Han, it was often held that law and divination required interpretation that utilized the performer's judgment. This similarity between the two was a function of shared cosmological assumptions. In the Han context, the assumption that all practices were related as expressions of the same overarching Dao was increasingly accepted. After the examination of the relationship between these technical and rhetorical aspects of the administration of justice and divination, we will turn to an example of how the vocabulary used to explain elements of the former practice was related to terms from the latter. It will be seen that in the third and second centuries B.C.E., the ideal combination of severity and lenience in administering justice was modeled on principles common to the context of divination. The administration of justice Much of the discussion of early Chinese law is based on specific rules and regulations, many of them found in newly excavated materials, that made up the legal codes of early China. There is nothing wrong with this approach, and it makes quite a bit of sense at the end of the twentieth century, a time when the « rule of law » is 112</page><page sequence="3">Severity and lenience : Divination and law in early imperial China celebrated, to identify the administration of justice with the application of specific laws. Yet from the point of view of some early Chinese writers, application of such impartial standards was not the best way to guarantee a just society. In the pre-imperial period, no less a figure than Confucius preferred leading the people by virtue and rituals to leading them by edicts and punishments. His reason was common to virtue ethicists everywhere : constraining behavior by fear of punishment may keep people out of trouble, but will leave them without a « sense of shame {chi) 5 ». Since Confucius 's ideal society maximized the development of virtue in individuals, the uniform application of laws was condemned because it did not encourage this development 6. He even gives an example of a case in which the requirements of the legal system could cause a person to act contrary to virtue. When told of a man named Gong, known for his uprightness (zhi), who testified that his own father had stolen a sheep, Confucius observes : Where I come from, being upright differs from this. A father would conceal such a thing on behalf of his son, and a son would conceal it on behalf of his father. Uprightness is found in this 7. By ranking the cultivation of the virtue of filial piety ( xiao ) over the sanctity of private property, Confucius is not denying that stealing is either unjust or injurious to social order, but rather making the point that on the level of society, the best path to ending such behavior is inculcating virtue. Because of the influence of this point of view, any discussion of the administration of justice in early China cannot be reduced to the content of legal codes. This view was not the only one, as Confucius was indirectly criticized by legal absolutists such as Han Fei (d. 233 B.C.E.) who made no secret of his disapproval of special pleading. The Han Feizi argued that the consideration of exigencies disrupted the government : In the state of Chu there was a certain « Upright » Gong whose father stole a sheep, and he reported this to a local official. The magistrate said that (Gong) was to be killed, for although he was upright toward his ruler, he was crooked toward his father. Even though (Gong) had reported it, it was he who was found guilty 8 ! Han Fei's indignation provides an implicit rebuttal to the version of the story told by Confucius, and the two versions of the story represent two poles of the debate about character development and legal exigencies in pre-imperial China. Confucius 's notion of justice was predicated on the creation in all individuals of a set of virtues that were more reliable than following rules, while Han Fei's was based on the idea that the application of rules should be blind to exigencies of relationship and situation. Following the short-lived triumph of the Qin, the Han faced the difficult task of developing a new means of administering justice over a unified and expanded empire. 113</page><page sequence="4">Mark Csikszentmihalyi The Qin code strongly influenced the policies of the Han, as did the absolutist theory of Han Fei that informed it. At the same time, the Han court was also sensitive to the concerns of Confucius that a reliance on punishment would neutralize people's ability to develop individual moral sensibilities. The Han's dependence on the Qin legal code forced even those who advocated the cultivation of the virtues to find a way to integrate the rule of law with the cultivation of the virtues. So it was that in 66 B.C.E., Emperor Huan sought to give Confucius 's ethical ideal legal reality by issuing the following edict : The closeness of parent and child, the way of husband and wife, are matters of Heaven- given nature. Although a person (in such a relationship) might have problems and bad fortune, nevertheless that person would sacrifice life itself to sustain the other (member of the relationship). Their minds are united in their mutual sincere caring, and in this sense are the epitome of benevolence and kindness. Who could possibly oppose such a thing ? From this point forward, a child who masterminds the concealment of parents, a wife who conceals her husband, a grandchild who conceals a grandparent - none will be brought to trial. If a parent conceals a child, a husband conceals a wife, or a grandparent conceals a grandchild, and (the concealed party is) found guilty of a capital crime, the case (against the concealing party) will all be sent up to the Commandant of Justice (tingwei) for a hearing 9. The edict ensures that the family relationships held sacrosanct by Confucius were in this way the object of a system that nested authority on the levels of : 1) prefecture, 2) commandery or principality, and 3) capital. These three tiers of authority operated as successive checks on the administration of the legal code. At the regional level, the Grand Administrator ( taishou ) theoretically had the power to review the decisions of the prefects (ling) and chiefs (zhang) at the level of the prefecture. Emperor Huan's edict referred to the overarching power of the Commandant of Justice to resolve problems with the decisions of the Grand Administrators, and guaranteed that cases in which people are convicted of harboring their own close relatives would be subject to judicial review 10. This is an instance of an attempt to institutionalize the relational sense of morality associated with Confucius in the law itself. Implicit in this system of checks is the assumption that the highest officials are better able to balance the imperative to apply the law against the need to consider exigencies. This assumption, that the Commandant of Justice, earning fully 2000 bushels, would be better able to balance these goods than a prefectural governor, who earned from 300 to 1000 bushels, reflects the notion that it was the self-cultivation of virtues of the élite bureaucrats that put them in a unique position to make such decisions. This was the type of official that the Han statesman Jia Yi (200-168 B.C.E.) had earlier sought to exempt from the very penalties they were charged with applying, because it is a characteristic of human beings that « when the ruler treats [such a 114</page><page sequence="5">Severity and lenience : Divination and law in early imperial China minister] with an honest sense of shame and in accordance with ritual and social obligations, then the minister will repay his superior by acting with integrity 11 ». Jia saw the rites as the system that should regulate the behavior of those at the top level of government, and the law as the system that should regulate the behavior of everyone else. Consequently, the Commandant of Justice was seen to be more likely to place the appropriate weight on exigencies arising from close relationships in keeping with a robust description of justice that allowed for the goal of self-cultivation of the virtues. At the time of the edict, Emperor Huan's longstanding Commandant of Justice was Yu Dingguo, a man who epitomized this attention to the intersection between the need to cultivate virtues and the authority of the rule of law. Yu was known for taking just such considerations into account. The Hanshu notes his « efforts on behalf of widows and widowers in mourning. When guilt was in doubt, he followed the course of leniency, applying his careful and circumspect mind 12 ». Yu learned this kind of behavior from his father, who worked in a bureau in charge of criminal law under Grand Administrator of Donghai Commandery. The case that defined the elder Yu's career had been the defense of a woman who had been falsely accused of murdering her mother-in-law. After investigating the case, the elder Yu became convinced of her innocence based on her ten years of filially pious behavior toward her mother-in-law. The Prefect was not convinced, executed the woman, triggering both the elder Yu's resignation and three years of drought. The next Prefect had a divination performed to find out the reason for the drought. When an ox was ritually sacrificed at the grave of the executed woman, it began to rain. The Yu's were exactly the type of official that Emperor Huan wanted to have overseeing cases at the intersection of law and virtue, and this is what his edict set out to accomplish. The story of the unjust execution provides a rare example of the use of divination concerning a legal matter. To understand why a diviner was called in, let us momentarily bracket the discussion of law, and turn to the place of divination in the Han world. Divination and Han cosmology The way in which divination could aid the administration of justice in the case of Yu Dingguo 's father illustrates the way that, in the Han, law and divination were seen to operate in the same moral universe. This assumption grew out of the totalistic view of the cosmos that had become current in the Han, one in which a variety of techniques were efficacious because they were constituents of an overarching and ineffable Way (dao) 13. The backdrop against which this view must be understood is the change in cosmology that took place in the fourth through first centuries B.C.E. In terms derived from other traditions, this period saw the conception of a universe governed by anthropomorphic deities increasingly integrated into a naturalistic view of the cosmos. While the Shang addressed their ancestors under the collective name Shangdi, and the 115</page><page sequence="6">Mark Csikszentmihalyi Zhou reportedly perceived the workings of á personified tian all around them, writers in the fourth century saw an increasingly impersonal tian and explained changes in the observable world as the effect of one object on another that was related to it according to a set of correlative schemata l4. In the case of Chinese divination practice, this entailed a move from divination in the strict sense (i.e., practice that assumes a divinity) to omenology. This distinction does not mean that the two conceptions of the cosmos were mutually exclusive. The same method of divination could be explained in very different ways depending on which set of cosmological assumptions was being adopted. In the manner of a technology that continues to be used even while explanations of what makes it work changed, the technical aspects of prediction (a term I will use to encompass both divining and reading omens) remained relatively constant while the general understanding of the basis of its efficacy varied. Examples of predictions that assumed the agency of anthropomorphic deities are the late fourth century divinations found at Baoshan. These divinations were addressed to such figures as Great Unity ( Taiyi ), a set of celestial officials including the Master of Fate ( Siming ), spirits of rivers and mountains, doorways, dwellings and directions 15. The idea of invoking a particular deity to assure or request good fortune was characteristic of an anthropomorphic view of the cosmos, and this view persisted in China through the Han and continues in the present day. Coexisting with this anthropomorphic view of the world was a naturalistic worldview that posited that human actions result in potentially predictable responses. This view received its earliest full articulation in the « Tianlun », chapter 17 of the Xunzi. In that text, the sage could have foreknowledge of the reactions of tian : « If one cultivates the Way wholeheartedly, then tian cannot send down misfortune 16. » While it is possible to describe this view as naturalistic, the absence of a rigid distinction between fact and value meant that the idea of nature governed by impersonal cause and effect inherent in this conception of tian also contained moral elements 17 . A good illustration of this is the story of Yu Dingguo related earlier, in which a miscarriage of justice brings catastophes from tian. This change in cosmological views precipitated a debate about whether prediction was absolute or contingent. In a naturalistic view, the result of the casting of milfoil stalks was an expression of the potential inherent in the conjunction of an individual and the world at a particular moment in time. Michael Loewe has described the rationale behind the Han practice of casting of stalks according to the Classic of Changes in this way : The throw that resulted in the production of any one hexagram, with or without its movement into the next, should not be regarded as a matter of chance ; it took shape as an inherent and inescapable element of a particular moment of time, or of a particular moment in the cycle 18. 116</page><page sequence="7">Severity and lenience : Divination and law in early imperial China As such, the individual's state at the time of a casting, including the moral quality of his or her actions, determined the results. The stalks were part of the natural world, and so were sensitive to potentials that changed over time. To the extent that such a procedure permitted a forecast, it was only a function of the capacity of the stalks to comprehensively monitor current conditions, gaining information to which the principles of orderly change could be applied. The role of the expert in casting stalks was not so much to foretell the future, but more to diagnose the present and counsel moral action as a means of preventing bad outcomes in the future 19 . The idea of seeking the approval of a deity or deities for a course of action or leaving one's lifespan in the hands of a « Master of Fate » may then be seen as entailing a different idea of fate than the one found in such a naturalistic system. In the latter, the future is not subject to the arbitrariness of a responding deity, but is instead enmeshed in the alternations of the natural system. The idea of alternation is seen clearly in a set of third century comments on the passage « Misfortune is what good fortune rests upon, and good fortune is what misfortune subsides into », found in the Laozi , traditionally numbered as chapter 55 of that text. The Han Feizi commentary to this passage explains the mechanism behind the alternation of good and bad fortune : When people have misfortune, fear rises in their minds. When fear rises in their minds, then their actions will be upright. When their actions are upright, then their thoughts will be well-considered. If their thoughts are well-considered, then they will grasp the principles of affairs. If their actions are upright, then they will not suffer misfortune and injury. If they do not suffer misfortune and injury, then they will live out their natural span. If they grasp the principles of affairs, then they will be certain to succeed. If they live out their natural span, then they will be preserved and long-lived. If they are certain to succeed, then they will be rich and noble. To be preserved, long-lived, rich and noble is called « good fortune, » and since good fortune is based on having misfortune, [the Laozi] says : « Misfortune is what good fortune rests upon, and good fortune is what misfortune subsides into 20. » Han Feizi explains the alternation not as the result of the intentions of a cosmic lawgiver but rather as a natural result of uprightness (« duanzhi ) leading to good fortune, combined with wickedness leading to bad fortune. This is combined with the idea that humans respond to fear by reforming their behavior to show how misfortune leads to upright actions (and how good fortune results in wicked (xiepi) actions), proving the inevitability of the reversal of fortune spoken of in the Laozi . In this explanation, good and bad fortune are merely descriptive of the extreme values of the sinusoidal wave that describes an inevitable response to changing circumstances 21 . From this perspective, the prediction is best seen as an interpretation of natural signs that results in an omen or a « natural diagnosis » of an individual at a particular time. It does not tell one's fate because it is possible that once presented with this diagnosis, actions may be taken to address its causes and alter the ultimate outcome. 117</page><page sequence="8">Mark Csikszentmihalyi This view is expressed by the sage-king Tang in the explanation of the same Laozi passage in the third century B.C.E. compendium Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Lii [Liishi chunqiu] : In the time of Cheng Tang, stalks of grain began to grow in the courtyard. They began to grow at dusk and by dawn they had grown large enough to circle one's arms around. His officials consulted a diviner to find out why this had happened. Tang sent away the diviner, saying : « I have heard it said that "auspicious signs precede good fortune". If you receive auspicious signs but your actions are not good then good fortune will not arrive. "Inauspicious signs procede misfortune." If you receive inauspicious signs but your actions are good, then misfortune will not arrive. » From then on, he rose early and retired late, asked after the sick and mourned the dead, and worked to calm and pacify the common people. In three days, the grain died. Therefore, it is said that : « Misfortune is what good fortune rests upon, and good fortune is what misfortune subsides into 22 . » The sage-king's view is closely tied to a naturalistic view of the universe in which good actions are rewarded. These third century B.C.E. texts have a clear precedent in the Mozi , which makes the point that a position that holds that punishment and reward are fated would undermine people's motives for being filially pious and ritually proper 23. This is not so much a condemnation of prediction as a critique of the popular tendency to consider forecasts unalterable. Many Han accounts specifically criticize the idea that the outcomes of casting milfoil shells or heating tortoise plastrons were the expression of the will of a deity. Wang Chong (137-192 C.E.) marshaled a myriad of arguments against two hypotheses that his contemporaries used to explain the efficacy of prediction by stalks and shells : 1) that Heaven and Earth actually answer the questions of diviners via physical changes in tortoise shell and milfoil stalks, and 2) that the qi (« life, » « energy ») of Heaven and Earth inside a person projects answers through the « inspired » manipulation of the media of prediction. Wang argued instead that predictions reflect the individual's incipient fortune through the resonance of like categories : [...] [T] hus it appears that those who divine by stalks and shells also must have good and bad fortune. Some of those who have discussed it say that (good and bad fortune) result from the good or bad actions of this individual, so that luck and agreement resonate and turn up with goodness, and disasters and freaks arrive following fault. Good and bad governance is brought about by goodness and fault, and I suspect that it is not the case that tian and Earth purposively respond. When a fortunate person drills a tortoise, the person finds good signs, while a person with poor fortune casts the milfoil and receives bad numbers 24 . 118</page><page sequence="9">Severity and lenience : Divination and law in early imperial China Rejecting an anthropomorphic understanding of tian , Wang proposes a solution that does not entail volition on the part of tian and Earth. By contrast, Wang Fu (78-163 C.E.) accepts an anthropomorphic view, but does not believe that using stalks and shells is a means to access the deities : When it comes to the spirits of tian and Earth such as the Year Star ( Taisui ), Feng Long, Gou Chen, and General Taiyin, these are officials of tian and not meant to be served by ordinary people. The reason why tian has these spirits is that they all benefit creatures by fostering the completion of yin and yang , just as human governance has provincial magistrates, prefects and chiefs. If you approach them, what reason would they have for anger ? If you turn your back to them, what reason would they have for displeasure ? The ways of the gentleman and the commoner run close together, it is not right for them to rely on each other. So much the more with the veneration of spirits whose sense of propriety is different from that of people. How could it be appropriate to have expectations of them 25 ? Wang Fu accepts the presence of such « officials of tian , » but says they are too busy keeping things running to answer the questions of ordinary people. Both Wang's agree that prediction does not elicit responses from individual deities, even while they appear to disagree on the issue of whether such deities exist. As such, while their views of the cosmos may differ, both their understandings of the way in which methods of prediction function were naturalistic in the sense described above. Since predictions were not seen as the result of deities operating « outside » the system, the naturalistic schemata of the Han held that human behavior and the inevitable response to it were both part of the same system. This perspective on Han cosmology as an integrative system explains how, in the example of the case handled by Yu Dingguo's father, the roles of the administrator of justice and the diviner were related. The injustice of the initial execution led to exactly the set of natural omens that the diviner was able to diagnose as proof of the victim's innocence. The « Yueling » section of the Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Lii gives an earlier example of the idea that such an unjust execution might bring such a disaster : « Execution must be appropriate, with no perversion (of fact), or else one will face calamity 26. » Thus, the behavior of the accused, the judgment of the magistrate, and the effects of both in the natural world, were all part of the same system. Accurate human observation of that system may provide information that, if interpreted by a person possessing a sagacious understanding of the regular outcomes of moral and immoral behavior, would be sufficient to decide cases justly. Unfortunately, in the case examined above it was the lower official who had this understanding, and not his superior, and this gave rise to the miscarriage of justice and the resulting bad omens. Because these omens arose in a natural world that reacts in an impartial manner, the skilled manipulator of the stalks, acting as a post facto judge, was able to confirm that Yu Dingguo's father had, in fact, been correct. 119</page><page sequence="10">Mark Csikszentmihalyi The fact that, in Yu's case, law and divination worked within the same system indicates that their practice was bound by shared cosmological assumptions in the Han. The question of when this link began is an interesting one, and one solution that refers back to the story of Upright Gong introduced above, is offered below. Combining the virtues Two important issues in Han law were introduced earlier : the attempt to adapt the law to avoid conflicts of law and morality, and the need to remedy misapplications of penal law. Both reflect the need to balance ethical imperatives with the application of a uniform legal code, and, characteristically in early China, ground hopes for the possibility of integrating ethical concerns with the need for an ordered polity in the cultivated judgment of an enlightened individual. The issue of how, specifically, such individuals were to combine severity and lenience, is a more complicated one. How, exactly, did a judicial authority develop the ability to judge in this way ? While there can be no uniform answer to this question, one of the most developed answers is offered in a recently discovered text called the Five Kinds of Action ( Wuxing ). This text expresses the development of severity and lenience as a function of the development of the virtues of righteousness (yi) and benevolence ( ren ) in the context of making judgments. These two virtues should ideally be maximized in the style of the mutual complementarity of yin and yang. While the edict of emperor Huan attempted to bring the virtues into the law, the approach in the Five Kinds of Action is to bring the dual imperatives that one must act with public-mindedness and that one must exercise compassion into the discourse on the development of virtues. The « text » itself actually is three different entities, two versions of a « classic » found at Mawangdui and Guodian, and a partial « explanation » of the former classic also found at Mawangdui. Dates of these texts are not known with certainty, but the date of 300 B.C.E. has been offered as a terminus ad quem for the Guodian canon, and 168 B.C.E. is a firmly established terminus ad quern for the Mawangdui texts 27 . While the authorship of the Five Kinds of Action texts is uncertain, there are several reasons to associate the materials in the Guodian find with Zi Si, a figure who has at times been identified as Confucius's grandson 28. This substantiates the identification, first made by Pang Pu, of the Five Kinds of Action texts as the subject of a critical account of a « wuxing theory » in the third century B.C.E. text Xunzi 29 . On this basis, the Five Kinds of Action was associated with the « school » of Mencius and Zi Si. Yet it is also the case that the Han Feizi locates Mencius and Zi Si in two separate categories 30, and that some scholars have found differences between their perspectives 31 . In light of these considerations, it is possible that Xunzi' s reference to a Zi Si and Mencius grouping might indicate teacher- student or classic-explanation pairing along the lines of the interpretation that Anna Seidel has suggested for the pairing Huang Lao 32. This scenario might imply that the classic of the Five Kinds of Action was the work of Zi Si, while the explanation could be attributed to Mencius. 120</page><page sequence="11">Severity and lenience : Divination and law in early imperial China The Five Kinds of Action contains an excellent technical discussion of the way an individual engaged in self-cultivation might, in a practical setting, adjust the need to apply the law according to a relational sense of morality outlined above. The Five Kinds of Action grounds this process in the cultivation of two of the virtues central to Confucius 's ethical picture, righteousness and benevolence. The twentieth section of the Mawangdui Five Kinds of Action classic is dedicated to the way one applies benevolence and righteousness in a decision-making context. The two virtues each have a method (fang ) for making decisions, « selectiveness (jian ) is the method of righteousness and special consideration (ni) is the method of benevolence 33 ». The first of these two methods, selectiveness, is elaborated in the Five Kinds of Action . In the Guodian text's discussion of the application of righteousness, selectiveness is defined : « Avoiding injury to the great Way on account of little ways - this is selectiveness 34. » The Mawangdui commentary makes it clear that selectiveness is a version of the unmediated « uprightness » of Gong in the Analects : « Even if it is one's kin, one still brandishes punishment ; this is selectiveness 35. » The explanation of the classic's definition of selectiveness fleshes out the « method of righteousness » : « To avoid injury to the great Way on account of little ways ; this is selectiveness. » Selectiveness is avoiding injuring great loves on account of little loves or injuring great righteousnesses on account of little righteousnesses. « If one sees it alive, one does not eat its corpse. » Even if it is one's kin, one still brandishes punishment - this is selectiveness 36. The three independent illustrations of selectiveness in the passage all provide insight into this method. The first - comparing selectiveness to caring for another - emphasizes that one may have multiple allegiances, but that one must maintain priorities among them. The allusion to the Mencius story of the King Xuan of Qi and the ox in this passage shows that the selectiveness depends on locating oneself in a position from which one cannot be moved by sympathy, thereby avoiding the reaction of King Xuan to the human qualities of the ox. A similar distancing is indicated by the third line of the explanation, in which selectiveness is seen as being immune to considerations of kinship. Selectiveness, then, is akin to impartiality in identifying the relevant law and choosing the appropriate punishment. Section 21 of the Guodian text associates selectiveness with the severe punishment of a significant crime 37. The need to apply legal penalties in a judicial setting is then an aspect of the virtue of righteousness. By contrast, special consideration is associated in the Guodian text of Five Kinds of Action not with severity in punishment, but with pardoning a trivial crime 38. The term « special consideration » literally means to conceal, and is used in the latter sense to describe the « special consideration » a parent gives a guilty child by concealing them. This usage of the term is seen in the first century B.C.E. text Discourses on Salt 121</page><page sequence="12">Mark Csikszentmihalyi and Iron ( Yantielun ) : « (The attitude of) parents toward their child, even if (the children) are guilty (the parents) will still conceal (ni) them. How could they desire to testify to their guilt 39 ? » The impulse to treat a stranger with the partiality reserved for a family member is at the core of the « method of benevolence ». This is the reaction that King Xuan has, when he says of the ox : « It was as if he were without guilt, yet was being led to the place of execution » In this sense, the impulse to be partial toward the accused, to sympathize with them in a way that is blind to their faults, is the essence of special consideration. The Five Kinds of Action holds that a gentleman must exercise both selectiveness and special consideration, two qualities that at first may seem to imply contradictory types of action. The two ways of acting are likened to two other qualities in tension : « Hardness is a method of righteousness, and pliancy is a method of benevolence 41 . » In turn, the relationship between hardness and pliancy has been seen to be indicative of yinyang thought. Kobayashi Shinmei has pointed out that in several texts now thought to date from the third and second centuries B.C.E., yin and yang are associated with the terms « pliant » (rou) and « hard » (gang), which are related to each other as parts of a cycle in the Laozi , the Documents , and other sources 42. In the Han, the relationship between divination and these two virtues important in the administration of justice may be seen in texts related to the Classic of Changes that explicitly relate the two. One such text is the Explanations of the Trigrams (Shuogua) commentary to the Classic of Changes : They observed the alternations of yin and yang and established the eight trigrams. When this manifested itself in « pliant » and « hard, » the lines were produced... [The ancient sages] established Heaven's Way and it was called « yin » and « yang , » established Earth's Way and called it « pliant » and « hard » and established the human way and called it « benevolent » and « righteous » 43 . The terminology used in this passage is particular to the Classic of Changes , which centers on sixty-four hexagrams each with a unique combination of solid (yang) or broken (yin) lines. It homologizes yin to pliancy and benevolence, and yang to hardness and righteousness 44 . The Five Kinds of Action may well be the earliest example of benevolence and righteousness being considered the equivalent of yin and yang in the human realm. The need for a combination of benevolence and righteousness is an idea developed at greater length in several Han texts. The correlation of benevolence and righteousness with yin and yang is also found in the work of Lu Jia (d. 178 B.C.E.) 45, and Han Ying (fl. 150 B.C.E.) applies the need for both virtues to Confucius 's case of Upright Gong. In the Hanshi waijuan , Han makes the contrast between the two virtues explicit : If one conceals something on behalf of one's father, one's righteousness has not reached the level of « uprightness ». If the ruler executes the unrighteous then benevolence has 122</page><page sequence="13">Severity and lenience : Divination and law in early imperial China not reached the level of « basic care ». Although it may go against benevolence and injure righteousness, the law (fa) is in the middle of these extremes 46. This example is notable for the fact that the law, in an abstract sense, is seen to ideally combine these two otherwise competing virtues. This idea of law is clearly a Han Confucian alternative to the absolutist conception of law seen above in the Han Feizi. That the virtues needed to be combined is one of the overarching themes of the Five Kinds of Action. That text's organization in terms of fivefold processes is an expression of its concern with integrating the four virtues that Mencius thought constituted the moral mind into a fifth, that of sagacity ( sheng ). The ability to harmonize these virtues was seen to be progressing a step beyond what is merely « goodness » and following the « human Way, » to « virtue » and following « tiarì s Way » 47. The harmonies outlined in the Five Kinds of Action may be likened to the thesis of the « unity of the virtues » found in the writings of some early Greek thinkers 48. A similar conception of the virtues culminating in a harmony that derives from tian is also present in the postscript of the section on the « Six Attainments » (. Liuyi ) in the bibliographical inventory of the first century C.E. History of the Han ( Honshu ). The postscript lists the way that five of the six canonical texts associated with Confucius are each associated with a virtue : Of the texts of the « Six Attainments, » the Music [ Yue ] may be used to harmonize the spirits, and is the standard of benevolence. The Poetry may be used to normalize speech, and is the application of righteousness. The Ritual may be used to clarify the body ; those who understand it are clear in their representations and are never reprimanded. The Documents may be used to listen broadly, and is a technique of wisdom. The Spring and Autumn Annals may be used to adjudicate affairs ; it is the tally of trustworthiness. These five, generally speaking, are called the way of the five constants 49. In this passage, the five constants are related to the five virtues. It is significant that the Classic of Changes is not correlated to a particular virtue, and is instead called the « source » of the virtues. This places the Classic of Changes in a privileged position relative to the other classics, in the same way that the pliant and hard lines of its hexagrams were seen as the underlying method of balancing the virtues of benevolence and righteousness in the Five Kinds of Action. The relationship between the totalistic cosmology associated with this ancient divination text and the moral teaching of the other classics was parallel to the sage's ability to combine the virtues derived from those classics. The Five Kinds of Action interpreted the Confucian virtues in the light of the totalizing perspective of the Classic of Changes. In the Five Kinds of Action, the virtues came to be naturalized into an image of the cosmos in which judicious combination of benevolence and righteousness produced the best application of the law. The idea of the virtues in a mutually complementary relationship was then developed more completely in the full-fledged correlative cosmology of the Han. 123</page><page sequence="14">Mark Csikszentmihalyi Conclusion Whatever the origin of laws, their application requires interpretation, and occasionally the reconciliation of the letter of the law with conflicting moral intuitions. These issues became especially relevant in the Han dynasty, when the legal code inherited from the Qin came under criticism for its rigid and arbitrary nature. It is in this area that Han writers had recourse to the concept of combining severity and lenience, the methods of righteousness and benevolence, that had been developed by the authors of the Five Kinds of Action. This combination fit in with an understanding of the cosmos that allowed them to arbitrate between the conflicting pulls of different virtues, an understanding that also informed the interpretation of divination results. Severity and lenience were internalized by the just sage in the same way that yin and yang combined to comprise tian. This is the essence of the rather different reading of the story of Upright Gong found in the third century B.C.E. text Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Lii. There, Gong reports his father, who is sentenced to death. Gong then intervenes and asks to substitute for his father. When (Gong) was about to be executed, he told the official : « My father stole a sheep and I reported it, is this not trustworthiness ? When he was sentenced to death, I took his place, is this not filial piety ? » The king [of Chu] then did not execute him 50. The king, in this example, was clearly trying to be the kind of judge that Yu Dingguo would later become. He was able to diagnose that Gong's balance of the two virtues was the proper medium - the equivalent of the healthy balance of yin and yang in the body. It is in this latter sense that the ruler of « luminous intelligence » was comparable in his role to the diviner, reading the alternations of fortune in the « hard » and « pliant » lines of the hexagrams.

Several examples of flexibility in sentencing appear below. An excellent example of flexibility in the context of divination may be found in Richard J. Smith's discussion of « Spirit Mediums and Spirit Messages » (1991, p. 243). Smith tells the story of a qian (spirit stalk) diviner approached by a woman who says her problem is that her husband has a concubine. He asks her if she has children and if her husband gives her money. When she answers yes to both questions, he recommends that she not separate from her husband. 5.

It is still common to assume that « is » and « ought » are always ontologically distinct, perhaps due to the rapprochement between science and religion (Shapin, 1996, p. 135- 142). This distinction is not found in Han discussions of nature. 18. Loe we, 1975, p. 50. 19. Moral knowledge could then be seen as the general principles of behavior that could be derived from the records of past changes coupled with the resulting outcomes of those changes. A related point is made by K. C. Chang about the origins of Chinese historiography (1983, p. 88-94). In the synthetic atmosphere of the late Warring States and Qin-Han periods, moral knowledge was accessible through the study of such precedents. This was precisely the approach, reading history as a source for information about moral precedents, taken by the writers of some commentaries to the Spring and Autumn Annals. 20.

On the generic distinction between « classic » (/wg) and « explanation » ( shuo ), see Ikeda, 1993, p. 48-54. For the dating of the Mawangdui texts, see Csikszentmihalyi, 1998, and for that of the Guodian canon, see Cui, 1997. 28. The first reason for this association is the connection of other texts in the cache with Zi Si. One text, Duke Mu of Lu asked Zi Si (Lu Mugong wen Zi Si ), is a narrative illustrating the integrity of Zi Si ; another, Black Robes (Ziyi), is similar to chapter 33 of the Record of Ritual (Liji), one of the chapters attributed to Zi Si by Shen Yue (441- 513 C.E.) in the History of the Sui (Suishu). Another reason is the dating of the text, which places its composition most likely in the fourth century B.C.E. Biographical accounts relate that Kong Ji studied with Confucius 'sdisciple Zeng Can, and went on to teach Duke Mu of the state of Lu. Duke Mu probably reigned from 415 to 383 B.C.E., and Confucius is thought to have died in 479, so it is possible to project that Kong Ji was born in the early to mid-400 's and lived into the 300's. Finally, the association of a theory of the « Five phases » with Zi Si and Mencius in the Xunzi (see below) may bear on the Guodian text of the same name, despite the fact that the Guodian cache appears to predate the writings of Mencius. 29. See Pang, 1980. That account is found in chapter six of the Xunzi , a chapter that criticizes several theories. The chapter claims that « Zi Si sang it and Mencius provided harmony for it », accusing the two writers of concocting a « wuxing theory » that they falsely associated with Confucius (Xunzi jijie , ZZJC 3.60). 30. Han Feizi iiiie 50, ZZJC 19.351. 3 1 . Takeuchi Yoshio ( 1 922, 663) saw the important distinction between Zi Si and Mencius as their differing reliance on the Classic of Changes. While both used the Classic of Poetry (Shijing) and Documents (Shu), Mencius also drew on the Spring and Autumn Annals while texts associated with Zi Si draw heavily on the Classic of Changes. 32. Seidel, 1969. 33. Ikeda, 1993, p. 419. 34. Ikeda, 1993, p. 318. The Guodian classic has jian ' which also has the meaning of « to select » (Jingmenshi bowuguan , 1998, p. 150). At the end of chapter two of the Xunzi , in a passage that is also in classic-explanation form, the explanation explains the passage : « one's blood and qi are not weakened when one is settled or retired, » with the phrase « this is selectiveness of principles (jianli ) ». Knoblock distinguishes between this reading and his own rendering « restrained by the natural order » (Knoblock, 1988, p. 280, note 81), the latter having the virtue of stressing the self- discipline that both the Xunzi and Five Kinds of Action usages imply.

This is a particularly significant connection in terms of the Five Kinds of Action text, in light of Takeuchi's arguments about the importance of the Classic of Changes for Zi Si.

These unities are unities of the virtues in the strong sense, that is, they hold that you cannot truly have any virtue unless you have them all. This text would then contradict Alasdair Maclntyre's statement that « Confucianism denies [a Western] type of strong thesis about the unity of the virtues » (Maclntyre, 1991, p. 106). 49. Honshu 30.1723. 50. « Dangwu », Liishi chunqiu , ZZJC 11.110. This story is followed by Confucius's condemnation of the brand of « trustworthiness » exhibited by Upright Gong. The writer of that chapter of the Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Lii , however, condemns Gong for a « trustworthiness which is inferior to not being trustworthy », reflecting the reality that by the third century B.C.E., the idea that there existed a counterweight to filial piety was even accepted by those who tried to hew the Confucian line.
