New York: The Museum for African Art; Munich, London, New York: Prestel, 2000. 192 pp. According to a Yoruba saying, one's success or failure in life depends on the head. Indeed, as Babatunde Lawal tells us in Hair in African Art and Culture, Yoruba some- times refer to humanity itself as "the species that grows hair mainly on the head" (p. 95). The last 35 years have seen enormous growth in the popularity and variety of Afrocentric hairstyles worldwide, as the abundance of spe- cialized African-American salons in urban America makes evident. The efflorescence of black hairstyling in South Africa since the triumph of majority rule attests to a con- temporary resurgence of ethnic pride and its corporeal re- lations to ever-changing canons of personal beauty. In a perceptive 1990 essay, "Black Hair/Style Politics," Kobena Mercer posed the question "why do we pour so much creative energy into our hair?" (1990:248). His an- swer, in part, was that "In the complexity of [the] social code, hair functions as a key 'ethnic signifier' because, compared with bodily shape or facial features, it can be changed more easily by cultural practices.... Caught on the cusp between self and society, nature and culture, the malleability of hair makes it a sensitive area of expression" (1990:250). Because it is both naturalized as an inherited biological signifier of binary racial difference and cultural- ized as an unfixed and potentially destabilizing sign of group identity, hair is widely seen as a bodily indicator of cultural self-identification, political ideology, and social status. It is second perhaps only to skin color as a socially defined determinant of biologically based group affili- ation; but unlike skin, hair readily adapts itself to human creativity in a multitude of expressive appearances. Hair in African Art and Culture explores the beauty and significance of African hairstyles in two ways: through the exhibition of an exceptionally fine collection of artifacts and images displayed as art objects, which is currently em- barked on a two-year national tour, and in an extensively illustrated companion volume with contributions by more than a dozen scholars of art history, anthropology, and his- tory. In its inaugural run at the Museum for African Art in New York, the installation was divided into seven sections focusing on coiffure in relation to stages in the life cycle, authority symbols, spiritual potency, aesthetics, adorn- ment, protection of hairdo, and contemporary style. The traveling exhibition, which is supported by the Colgate- Palmolive Company (a global manufacturer of grooming products with a strong presence in Africa), depicts a daz- zling array of imagination and creativity in hairstyles from more than 100 peoples in 25 mostly sub-Saharan countries. The greatest number of examples are drawn from the southernmost regions of the continent-Madagascar, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia. There is a secon- dary emphasis on West African cultures, including a cura- torial masterstroke: a display of painted advertising signs, together with a complete barbershop from Ghana.</page><page sequence="2">MUSEUM ANTHROPOLOGY 183 The explanations offered in the exhibition labels are generally thin, but the voluminous catalog includes numer- ous short, focused, and detailed essays, plus a number of "Interludes" that mimic the minimal textual style of the ex- hibition. This publication, though conservatively designed, features a large number of handsome color reproductions of objects and many striking black-and-white photographs of Africans wearing an enormous variety of coiffures. In the combined work of the exhibition and the catalog, Cura- tors Roy Sieber (Professor Emeritus at Indiana University) and Frank Herreman (Director of Exhibitions at the Mu- seum for African Art) have done a virtuosic job, assem- bling and presenting a broad spectrum of art and photo- graphs to illustrate an important and undertheorized topic in Africanist discourse. The organizers are to be commended on an impressively mounted achievement. The size, quality, and scope of the assembled collection are all outstanding. The 170 objects on view in New York include many pieces borrowed from private collectors, drawing on some 40 lenders in total (pri- vate, institutional, and anonymous) including Roy and So- phia Sieber. The general organizational principles of each room are well thought out, blending aesthetic balance with a modicum of instruction. As the brevity of the catalog es- says testifies, there is still much to be explored and learned about this underrepresented subject. One of a number of recent museum shows devoted to the poetics of human bodies and the arts of adornment, "Hair in African Art and Culture" is a crucial entry into current exhibitionary circu- lation. Some of the catalog essays, most notably Lawal's richly ethnographic chapter "Orilonise: The Hermeneutics of the Head and Hairstyles among the Yoruba," address the in- consistency of the exhibition's minimal label copy head-on as it were, through an abundance of culture-historical facts. William Siegmann's contribution on Mende women's hair and Sowei masks in Sierra Leone and Liberia provides an in-depth treatment of the relations between sociality and symbolism while preserving the inherent mystery of Sande society ritual. Several of the authors touch on the key sub- ject of death and mortuary practices, such as disheveled or unkempt hair worn as a sign of mourning. While these scholars are quite diverse in their approaches and view- points, the kinds of information they present are largely ab- sent from the exhibition's wall-label texts. The latter con- form more nearly to art-historical descriptive convention and take on the unified character of a single institutional voice. The catalog follows a sequence roughly parallel to that of the installation. A striking image serves as frontispiece to both: a photograph of a woman in West Africa having her hair styled by two other women, each of whom sports a radically different coiffure. This picture sets the tone nicely, reminding us that hairdressing is an irreducibly social _? j??ii li~ii~i~i!ii!!i ?i :: 7. . . . .. .. .. ':i8Dii:AW- n! Ot Figure 1.

In the gallery, visitors are greeted by a general in- troduction and a pair of dissimilar objects. A spectacular crest mask with corkscrew braids (Figure 1) from Cross River, Nigeria, contrasts with a faceless, nearly abstract Kuba fertility doll wearing a stylized hairline. Each of these objects is accompanied by a small black-and-white photograph showing people wearing closely related if less elaborate coiffures. As Herreman suggests in the catalog (p. 54), this juxtaposition of photos and figures reveals "that the African sculptor represents hairstyles conceptu- ally rather than mimetically." On the other hand, Sieber points out in his prologue to the volume that coiffure and scarification on sculptures are often depicted realistically despite an overall style that might well be considered more abstract. The accentuation of distinctive features by artists emphasizing idealized forms is a motif that recurs through- out the display. For example, panel headings arranged ac- cording to big themes like "Hair in Life and Art" discuss how nonrealistic proportions exaggerating the size of the head in relation to the body are often connected with belief in particular supernatural beings. These attempts to link hairstyle and head form to categories of spiritual and social life provide a welcome level of context, yet in the attempt</page><page sequence="3">184 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 103, No. 1 * MARCH 2001 to convey the broadest possible strokes they are sometimes generalized to the point of ambiguity. The first exhibition gallery showcases a variety of hair- styles and sculptural forms through small metal figures from West Africa, wooden figures, and photographs. Four distinct, colorful Nigerian crest masks with striking faces share a case in front of a wall of eight black-and-white photographs of Shilluk, Oromo, and Turkana people. The juxtaposition of sculptural figures depicting coiffures or headdresses with archival photographs of people wearing different hairstyles is a dominant exhibitionary trope here, usually without overt commentary on the relationships be- tween life and art. A series of pedestal vitrines holds masks and figures including an interesting Ngangela face mask from Angola with long braids and fiber barrettes. One ped- estal label states that while sculptures honoring mother- hood may show mother and child with either identical or different hairstyles, "The reason for these variations is not known in most instances." This is an honest admission on the part of the curators; yet such vagueness tends to rein- force the distancing effect of the museum setting. By im- plication, a certain lack of agency gets ascribed to culture- bearers; if the reasons for variation remain avowedly inchoate to scholarship, one is left to wonder whether prac- titioners within the culture are more fully cognizant of them. A large section entitled "Hair as an Expression of the Life Cycle" relates hairstyles typical of youth to spiritual beliefs and stages of life. Here the relations between hair- style and culture are made more explicit, and the effects of acculturation and change are considered. A label discuss- ing girls in Benin who have special curls and traditionally become priestesses of Olokun, god of the waters, states that nowadays "many parents prefer their children to get education instead." A collection of Yoruba ibeji figures is displayed near a large, emblematic Fanti sculpture from Ghana with a priestess's hornlike hairdo. The statue is ac- companied by a set of four small photographs showing a woman as she appears at progressive stages of the making of the same coiffure. This gallery, with walls painted in a rather unappealing lime green color, is quite extensive and contains Mende helmet masks, Pende face masks, Baule figures, and a very small, highly refined Nguni River face mask from Gabon. The latter has a relatively informative caption indicating that similar masks would typically be danced on stilts and were formerly seen at funerals; ac- cording to label copy by Alissa LaGamma of the Metro- politan Museum of Art, they are "now becoming an ex- pression of national and cultural identity." A tall, exquisite sculpture from Madagascar, the work of an artist from an unidentified tribal group, is a deeply textured, nearly full- figured representation of a woman with knobby hair and an ovoid face. Equally impressive is a Bongo gravepost from Sudan, with an oddly terraced shape, heavy scratch marks around the mouth, and a notched and dappled surface. These two pieces, along with a Hemba figure wearing a skirt and a squarish coiffure, are presented almost without explanation. In the next gallery, entitled "Hair as a Declaration of Prestige," a rifle-toting Bembe ancestor figure from Congo- Brazzaville with bright white eyes, large toes, long penis, and shiny patina stands out both for its bold look and for what appears to be a critical or satirical stance vis-h-vis European colonialism. Elongated and distended bodily shapes, rather than coiffures, are the most prominent fea- tures of a braided Tabwa hunting figure and an evidently pregnant Yaka biteki from the University of Iowa's Stan- ley collection. A lovely Oron Ibibio figure from Nigeria is one of the few pieces in the show to draw attention more for its beard than for the hair on top of its head. (While beard and mustache hair are rarely emphasized, body hair is not featured at all in the exhibition.) The twisted braids of the long beard rhyme with the spiral forms of a pair of stick-like objects held in the hands and are offset by scarifi- cation marks around the face. Here again the lack of inter- pretation in either catalog or exhibition enhances the mys- tery of an object without illuminating its meaning. The center of the gallery is occupied by a large vitrine holding several pieces illustrating the Agogo or cocks- comb style worn by the Ibo/Ilefo of Nigeria. Some back- ground of ceremonial context is given for these pieces. Against one wall are eleven axes, adzes, and knives topped with carved anthropomorphic heads and sophisticated hairstyles, many of them with intriguing faces and blades actually projecting from their mouths in the manner of tongues. A label notes that they are important symbols of authority for the Luba and neighboring peoples. These im- plements, along with some combs and fly-whisk handles, are among the objects in the exhibition that might be con- sidered functionally as tools or utensils, as opposed to the more strictly ceremonial statues and masks. A Senufo an- cestor staff depicting a mother and child consists of a fig- ure seated upon a stool, tied with bundles of cowrie shells and bearing an animal on top of its anthropomorphic head. The fascinating complexity of the staff suggests a profun- dity of associations and ritual use, but by this point it comes as little surprise that no information is offered. A set of three divination bowls is described in general terms with a statement that their "aesthetics match the aesthetic ideals of the society." This sort of opacity would be more justifi- able in the case of a crest mask from Itoba, Nigeria, used in secret and semi-secret dance guilds; ironically, its label is one of the more informative in the show. Among the many impressive objects and photographs here, three Zulu women's hats woven of human hair and vegetable fiber in the shape of an inverted cone (a typically nineteenth-cen- tury development) are noteworthy for their brightly dyed orange color produced by a mixture of fat, red ochre, and commercial red yarn. A powerful Dan mask in the center of the room haunts museumgoers with its expressive face:</page><page sequence="4">MUSEUM ANTHROPOLOGY 185 open mouth, fine nose, and big, round floral eyes. Three exceptionally beautiful Baule portrait face masks from COte d'Ivoire--deep mahogany colored with a slightly reddish-brown tint, a patina of age, and a white powdery substance in the cracks along the edges-are reminiscent of some of the African sculptural styles that deeply influ- enced European artists during the 1920s and 1930s. A gallery entitled "Hair as a Power Substance" ad- dresses the important ritual and religious concept of hair as an extension or surrogate of the person. A statement re- garding the ties between hair and magic alerts the viewer that special properties are ascribed to human hair used in amulets or other objects. The pieces shown here, such as a medicine container from Cameroon, are not necessarily anthropomorphic, and so provide a contrast with the figu- rative emphasis elsewhere in the exhibition. A pair of ex- tremely powerful photographs dominates this small sec- tion. One is of a COte d'Ivoire healer circa 1974, wearing full regalia including an elaborate wig. The other shows a wise-looking, elderly Dan warrior, photographed in 1950, whose hair contains amulets, bells, and hoops. The formi- dable rows of teeth on two more Nigerian crest masks are more imposing than their hair, which is done up in corn- row braids with cowrie-shell beads-a familiar style that is extremely popular today. Despite the seemingly strange and fierce look of some of the masks in this section, a case label reports that "they are usually benign because they of- fer powerful protection against evil forces." A small alcove in the back of the room focuses on "Cre- ating Hair Arrangements." Panel text highlights the social relationships between hairdressers and their clients, the time-consuming and patient nature of the work, and the tools employed such as combs and razors. (Scissors were a later introduction to most of Africa.) A compelling set of photographs along one wall shows various individuals having their hair done. One of the best is a 1953 picture of a woman in Cameroon with hair as gnarled as tree roots, being worked on by her stylist who is covered in powder and holding a baby. Another outstanding image shows a priest having his hair styled in a manner that brings to mind the hip-hop star Busta Rhymes, while his hairdresser sports a fade with mounds on the top. The lower-level galleries of the Museum for African Art were given over to more photographs of amazing hairdos; long cases displaying a large number of combs, imple- ments, and neckrests; a photographic and video presenta- tion of contemporary diasporic hairstyles; and finally a group of advertising signs together with the exhibition's piece de r6sistance, a complete barbershop imported from West Africa. The recurrence of Cross River crest masks throughout the show is also continued in these galleries, making them an overarching motif. Notable among the ob- jects here is a Zemba ornament from southern Angola made of leather, fiber, bullet casings, and colorfully printed strips of tin. A display of neckrests for protecting coiffures while sleeping, a subject worthy of a small exhibition in its own right, suffers from a crowded overabundance of ex- amples (though many are quite fine) and a confusing wall- mounted diagram that makes identifying each individual piece a complicated exercise. In a catalog essay pointedly titled "Headrests and Hairpins Signifying More Than Status," Karel Nel reminds us that a bride's traveling head- rest, marking her transition to marriage, "cannot be viewed as a mere object-as we see it reproduced in books, or in isolated displays in this exhibition. It is carried on a tide of emotion and belief, a nexus for intersecting values and a focus of expectations" (p.151). A section titled "Innovating Coiffures" seeks to intro- duce the subject of outside--especially European-influ- ences including contact with Christianity and Islam, lead- ing to an assortment of recent head shots from Brooklyn and New York City. The latter add a sense of connection to the here and now and a bridge for the show's audience. The final gallery presents the exhibition's tour de force, a selec- tion of marvelously painted advertising signs from West African barbershops together with a complete barbershop imported from Ghana. These are virtually the only paint- ings in the show (as opposed to masks, sculptures, and a 4"-*-~~. ,:I*~~-??~8 ::us?--* U ::-?~ *p?iq_-;~ hX";?: jl~_ I ?: -.-- -i -; i*a*:,?:l_ ;-YI*.. ~i* -:~---~ '?~B~e~a~nn~ -"~8~?: % - a::: a?i.?--'~ :6i: :r --:;- Figure 2.

The commercial enterprise of the barbershop gives rise to a new art form-a creative adoption of the advertising me- dium-in the course of what Kennell Jackson's catalog es- say terms "ad hair events" (pp. 175-185). The iconography of these signs is basically that of an overt Americanism rendered gleefully askew in distinctive styles like the "Black president Hair Cut," "America Boy," "Champion USA," "Boeing 707," "Lover Boy," and the "Thank you Jesus hair cut" (see Figure 2). Full of wit, functionality, contemporaneity, and fun, these signs are in many ways the most effective objects in the show as they provide their own context and self-contained referentiality. Last but hardly least is the "Kwesi : B Clubbing House," a small wooden barbershop transported in its entirety from Ghana to the gallery floor. This typical shop is a work of art in its own right, one which truly needs no interpretive labeling. The doors and outer walls are adorned with posters of rap and R &amp; B stars, religious bumper stickers ("Read the Bible-Discover God's health-care plan!"), white peo- ple drawn as cartoon images, and other icons including U.S. flags and six-pointed stars. Inside one finds a chair, barber tools and supplies, more posters illustrating various haircuts, painted stars, and inspirational messages ("No drugs here," "Keep on Trying"). Two more "inspirational" posters can be found lurking almost unseen, discreetly cov- ered up by other signs. Cautiously lifting the top layer re- veals that one is a mildly risqu6 joke comparing a woman at different ages to different geographic regions of the world. Despite its obvious sexism and ageism, this elabo- rate folkloric riff nonetheless evinces a keen local perspec- tive on global cultures (for example, "At the Age of 17-21 She is like Africa, half-virgin half explored"; "At the Age of 31-40 She is like Britain badly battered by the effect of the war but still useful in the days of emergency"). The second hidden poster is an inspirational poem by A. L. Ampomah with a religious message of hope and faith: "... Opportunity is not one sided it is opened / For everybody. So only if you will / Strive hard, perseverance not left be- hind / Success shall that day crown your efforts." The popularity, diversity, and great creativity of Afro- centric hairstyles in the urban United States today under- score the importance and timeliness of the current exhibi- tion. This is a key point in establishing the relevance of the show's subject matter-much of which may strike some contemporary Americans as esoteric and unfamiliar-to modern diasporic fashions and identity politics. The por- trait gallery located toward the end of the exhibition, show- casing urban contemporary styles from New York City and the northeastern United States, makes implicit the con- nections to older, more traditional African styles. The re- sponses of visitors give the clearest indication of how a modern American-and especially African-American- audience can find tremendous vitality and affirmation in a show that otherwise might seem aesthetically rarefied and a bit remote, even in the context of a cosmopolitan venue. In some ways there is an apparent undercurrent of ten- sion here between representational styles. The problemat- ics of the older, magisterial mode of museological dis- course (with its neocolonialist connotations) clash against a more contemporary form of exhibitionary practice (with its generalizing imbrication of a homogenous, superficially celebratory tone). Africa, together with the local contin- gent of the North American diaspora, is subtextually con- ceptualized as a single place hosting a multitude of re- gional, tribal, and ethnic variations. Such a broad stance achieves a kind of overall unity in the presentation of a vast subject. Yet given the frequent sparseness of contextual detail in labels and wall panel texts, this gloss ensures that the exhibition never directly confronts the attendant risks of essentializing "Africanness." Similarly, there is a tendency in the brief introductory sections for the curators to lapse into an unqualified past tense implying an undefined ethnographic present. How- ever, both catalog and exhibition are usually careful to specify styles of both hair and art as belonging to definite times and places. What is largely missing is a consistent in- dication of change over time, as might be suggested by ex- amples drawn from successive generations. Shifting fash- ions, the influences of colonialism, and sustained historical interactions among peoples are only hinted at in the show, although some of the catalog essays (such as James Vaughan's on the Margi of Nigeria) do provide a longer- term view. One gets the impression that the organizers chose to show the best and most arresting images possible, even where diachronic periodization was not an option- a defensible choice on the grounds of the strength and rar- ity of the available documentation, particularly of old AiL41?

An appreciative review in the New York Times (February 11, 2000), prais- ing the quality and beauty of the objects and images on dis- play, asserted that in fact no explanations are necessary. Perhaps, but anthropologically minded observers seeking to read in cultural meanings may be frustrated by the pau- city of interpretation in the labels and panels. The juxtaposition of masks and sculptures with historic photographs and portraits provokes by inference many fas- cinating comparisons and insights into style, aesthetics, culture history, and the visuality of physiognomy. There is much here for viewers to discover and to contemplate. Yet throughout the display runs a tacit, unanswered question: What are the relationships between the fashionable coif- fures shown in photographs and the figuration seen in sculptures, masks, tools, combs, and ornaments? These are clarified in some cases, but often the curators rely solely upon visual correspondences as beheld through the eye of the observant individual visitor. Behind the basic question of the relations between visu- ality and corporeality lies an endlessly recurring conun- drum: What drives changes in fashion? Anthropologists since at least the time of Alfred Kroeber have puzzled over a wide range of socioeconomic factors, only to conclude teleologically that fashion drives itself. Kennell Jackson's insightful catalog essay "What is Really Happening Here? Black Hair among African-Americans and in American Culture" notes that "Black fashion in the twentieth century has waited for no one" (p. 179). His contribution succeeds better than many past efforts to chart the social forces be- hind "the inherent restlessness of fashion" (p. 179). The search for the engine of stylistic change carries a valence beyond the strictly ethnographic, for example as applied to the widespread and rapidly growing adoption of Afrocen- tric styles by people outside the black community. As Kobena Mercer elliptically stated the point in "Black Hair/Style Politics," "There are no just black hair-styles, just black hair-styles" (1990:263, emphasis added). Ken- nell Jackson concludes his catalog essay with the provoca- tive notion that where fashion is concerned black and white hair, no longer separable, are now morphing into one an- other. Critical analysis of the racialized discourse of Europeans regarding African hair is largely confined to the catalog's introductory survey of early explorers' chronicles and con- cluding chapters on contemporary diasporic hairstyles. Thus there is little discussion of the historical popularity of straightening techniques and relaxing pomades, for exam- ple, or of continuing debate over whether they should be interpreted as deracinated attempts at assimilation or as en- coded signs of resistance to white domination. This area, which may cause discomfort to some, is nonetheless ripe for further study-not only because of the creative re- sponses to bigotry engendered by white racist attitudes, but also because of the enormity of the implications of past as- sumptions. "Wooliness" or "kinkiness," read on the body as a sign of difference, historically carried sinister associa- tions of inferiority and polygenism. Jackson cites one mid- nineteenth-century writer who contended that "the Negro has on his head wool and not hair... since the white man has hair, they belong to two distinct species" (p. 183). While the catalog does clarify a great many discrepan- cies, the choice of minimal interpretation throughout much of the show has the effect of reinforcing a two-tier system of transcultural knowledge. The spectacular coiffures on display should provide ample inspiration for stylists, bar- bers, wigmakers, and other hair practitioners, but the meanings, social symbolism, and political ideologies be- hind the hairstyles are consigned to the more esoteric realm of textual scholarship. The relatively spare art-museum mode of presentation in this installation thus seems at odds with the richly nuanced ethnographic detail found in the accompanying catalog. Hair, as human body adornment, transects the conventionally established duality of art and artifact. Physically embodied and culturally read, coiffure is written on the body with a literalness that in some sense belies its malleability, transmuting qualities such as nappi- ness, frizziness, and shade into expressionistic, formalized statements of identity, status, ritual emplacement, sexual- ity, age-grade, or social practice. Yet these terms--of hair- style as corporeal extension that is simultaneously a social marker-are elided in the gallery's wealth of variation and relative lack of contextualization. The disjuncture between the many stunning objects and images and a minimal pres- entation style fosters a gap between appreciation and un- derstanding. What remains is an aestheticized survey of forms, indicating the strength and stylistic diversity of hair- dos, that can only hint at the myriad ways in which the head as body part is conceptualized in African lives. The aspects of unique individual expression and proud appearance created a bond between the exhibition as an event and its New York audience, based on the testimony of museumgoers as overheard and recorded in the com- ment book at the end of the exhibition space. Most of the opinions written there are glowing, and many people came away genuinely inspired. Pride is prominent in these re- sponses, many of which are quite eloquent. Some said it was the best museum show in the country, although others critiqued the signage and the lack of information on func- tional contexts. One visitor wrote, "We shouldn't show all of our secrets. Next these styles will be on fashion runways in Europe and people like Ralph Lauren will take credit for the 'designs.' " Another visitor remarked tersely that the museum looks like a shop. Indeed, with its fashionable SoHo address and its chic influence on stylistic trends, the present Museum for African Art seems to be following a tradition dating back to Stewart Culin's Brooklyn Museum</page><page sequence="7">188 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST * VOL. 103, No. 1 * MARCH 2001 Rainbow House of the 1920s, forging an aesthetic alliance between designers and "ethnic" art museums. The strategy of filling informational gaps in the pages of the catalog rather than with more extensive label texts may go beyond the conventional rhetoric of art-museum display methods to actually facilitate intimate aesthetic apprecia- tion. By avoiding the layering of overdetermined meanings onto the visual material, the presentation does allow museumgoers to respond on a more emotional, identifica- tory level. One visitor was surprised to see that her own hairstyle was that of an African high priestess. Another wrote that "Every affirmation that my curly, nappy, spring mane of locks is truly an important part of me (&amp; not just some fanatical obsession), puts my feet more firmly on the ground than they were the previous step. Every tear that I shed, mourning what I never knew, never experienced, quenches my soul and spurs me onward towards new knowledge and new confirmations." This salutary reaction is clearly a lofty and admirable ef- fect for any museum exhibition to have on its public. Yet there is also an exclusionary effect at work here, exempli- fied by the installation's wordless video by Christopher Bishop of an anonymous hairdresser. Urban practitioners and consumers of Afrocentric hairstyling are well equipped to study the techniques shown and can experi- ence the joy of cultural recognition, while those who are not already participants in the world of diasporic fashions are left to wonder about it. The location of the shop in the video is never given, so that New York City is (perhaps in- tentionally but rather confusingly) blended with Africa in the diasporic imagination of place. In other parts of the ex- hibition, some of these same African-American commu- nity members might face barriers to interpretation along with outsiders. One pedestal vitrine contains an array of Yoruba ibeji figures with their strong resonance of individ- ual dead twins. But the cultural context for the carving and keeping of the figures goes unmentioned, placing those who know in a privileged position to reflect on meaning and power while glossing over the comprehension of the rest. Whether or not a more inclusive approach to labeling and interpretation would foreclose on the insider's ability to fully participate in the stylistic community represented, or perhaps even impinge upon the aesthetic glories of the truly wondrous arts on display, is difficult to decide. The general impression made on the less well informed visitor seems to be that of an overwhelmingly aestheticized, greatly varied set of adornment practices traversing a vast range of cultures. In a presentation this ambitious in scope, fears of gilding the lily and information overload may have caused the curators to temper and limit the amount and kinds of textual and verbal information presented. None- theless, it is above all the splendid character of these ob- jects and images that leaves viewers wanting to know more. During one visit, a woman observed with delight that the Ghanaian barbershop resembled an African- American one in the South. Her voice swelled with pride as she proclaimed emphatically to her young son, "That's the link--creativity." Reference Cited Mercer, Kobena 1990 Black Hair/Style Politics.
