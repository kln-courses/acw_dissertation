<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGIOUS EMPIRICISM AS "-ISM": THE CRITICAL LEGACY OF WALTER KAUFMANN James Woelfel / The University of Kansas In this essay I want to recall and recognize the legacy of Walter Kaufmann as a philosopher of religion, with special attention to his critical appraisal of philosophy and theology as it bears on contemporary empiricist perspectives in religious thought. I believe that religious empiricists can learn and benefit from Kaufmann's understanding of the philosophical enterprise, his strictures against labelling or "isms," his vigorous critique of the whole enterprise of theology, and his richly developed analysis of what he calls the "essential ambiguity" of the idea of God. In order to appreciate more fully the breadth of learning and intense personal engagement Walter Kaufmann brought to the study of religion, it may be helpful to say something about his background. He was born in Freiburg, Germany, in 1921. All four of his grandparents had been Jewish, but Grandmother Kaufmann had urged her sons to take a familiar path to full social acceptability and become Christians. Kaufmann was raised a Lutheran until, at the age of eleven, he decided to return to the Jewish heritage of his grandparents and eventually brought his father and brother along with him, during the early and middle 1930s when things were starting to become increasingly difficult for Jews in Germany. Kaufmann points out that he took the Christian and Jewish faiths absolutely seriously (he was inclined to Orthodoxy as a Jew) until critical questions drove him out of both traditions, and he remained to the end of his life a skeptic with a passionate absorption in religion. He also acquired a good classical humanistic education in Germany which laid the foundations for the later direction of his scholarly interests. In 1939 Kaufmann's parents got him out of Germany and to the United States, where he entered Williams College. He majored in philosophy as an undergraduate, and won a scholarship to do graduate study at Harvard. His doctoral study was interrupted by four years in the United States Army. He returned to Harvard and completed the Ph.D. with a dissertation on "Nietzsche's Theory of Values" in 1947. For many years a distinguished scholar and teacher at Princeton, Kaufmann died in 1980. To understand Kaufmann's philosophical outlook it is essential to realize that his thought was informed by a remarkable breadth of learning and sensibility, and that he understood philosophy and its methods in a very large-minded way. He was a thoroughgoing humanist, in both of the usual senses of the term: by education and interest immersed in the humanities, and entirely devoted to exploring the human condition. Kaufmann was fully at home in philosophy, religion (especially Judaism,</page><page sequence="2">182 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Christianity, and Buddhism), classical and modern literature, and psychology in the Continental tradition. He was a published poet and photographer, and travelled and studied throughout the world. He brought to the study of Judaism and Christianity a knowledge of the original languages and of the biblical texts and theological literature that rivalled that of many scholars in those traditions. A sampling of titles from Kaufmann's many books provides a good indication of the range of subject matters and topics encompassed by his intellectual passions. I think many people know of Kaufmann only as a leading translator and interpreter of Nietzsche, and perhaps also for his widely-used anthology Existentialism from Dostoeusky to Sartre (1956). But he was also a translator of Goethe, numerous other modern German poets, and Martin Buber, and a substantial and original interpreter of the whole modern German tradition in philosophy, literature, and psychology. Kaufmann's last and most comprehensive project was a three-volume series with the general title Discovering the Mind (1980). Volume I was on Goethe, Kant, and Hegel; volume II on Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Buber; and volume III on Freud, Adler, and Jung. Among Kaufmann's other books are From Shakespeare to Existentialism (1959), Religion from Tolstoy to Camus (1961), Hegel: A Reinterpretation (1965) and Hegel's Political Philosophy (1970), Tragedy and Philosophy (1968), Religion in Four Dimensions: Existential and Aesthetic, Historical and Comparative (1976), and a series of books of photographs and text with titles such as Life at the Limits, Man's Lot, Time is an Artist, and What is Man? While his chief expertise and interest lay in Continental thought, Kaufmann also read and appreciatively critiqued British empiricism, positivism, and analytic philosophy, and he had considerable respect for Wittgenstein. It must be added at this point that, although he had also read James, Dewey, and Whitehead, he shows virtually no appreciation of what we have come to think of as the distinctive contributions of American pragmatism and of process philosophy. In presenting Kaufmann's discussions of philosophy, "-isms," theology, and God, I shall confine myself to the two books in which he devotes sustained attention to these issues: Critique of Religion and Philosophy1 and The Faith of a Heretic.2 1. Philosophy as a quest for honesty. Kaufmann's presentation of philosophy?like his approach to most subjects?is comprehensive and many-sided. But he makes clear that he considers the most important task 1. Walter Kaufmann, Critique of Religion and Philosophy (New York: Doubleday Anchor, 1961). 2. Walter Kaufmann, The Faith of a Heretic (New York: Doubleday Anchor, 1963).</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 15, No. 2, May 1994 183 and achievement of philosophy to lie in its tradition of critical questioning. For philosophy, "no man has authority, except provisionally: all opinions are subject to critical examination, though some may prevail even after acid tests."3 Kaufmann calls philosophy at its best "the quest for honesty,"4 which often takes the form of "heresy" or skepticism in relation to prevailing assumptions and conventions. In characterizing the methods by which philosophy carries out its critical task, he emphasizes, without restricting it to, "a search for truth that involves following arguments and evidence, without recourse to authority, wherever they may lead .. ."5 This is in fact the method Kaufmann himself uses and frequently invokes, albeit in a very expansive way appropriate to the subject matters with which he mainly deals?religion, art, and morality. Kaufmann also argues that philosophy "at its best" addresses itself to the central and perennial issues of human life, and changes the life of the person who comes under its influence. So indeed do religion and art; but what distinguishes the philosopher is living in the tension between criticism and engagement. The idea of philosophy as a way of life as well as a critical humanism is of course an ancient one, and Socrates is its patron saint. Socrates is indeed Kaufmann's patron, "the unexamined life is not worth living" is his motto, and Kaufmann clearly sees himself as philosophizing in a Socratic mode appropriate to the twentieth century. For philosophy so conceived there can be no dichotomy between reason and passion, but only a passion channeled and corrected by critical reason and a reason that is not blind to the realities of passion in oneself and in the human situation. In its inception .. . philosophy is a way of life and, as the Greek word suggests, a kind of love and devotion. It is the life of reflective passion?penetrating experience, unimpeded by accepted formulas.. . . That was what philosophy meant to Socrates, and if we want to bring philosophy down to earth again, it can mean nothing less than that to us.6 We should not be surprised by this point to find that Kaufmann, like Nietzsche, also considers both playfulness and polemics to be not only legitimate but eminently desirable characteristics of the philosopher. He 3. Ibid., 21. 4. Ibid., 23. 5. Ibid., 17. 6. Critique of Religion and Ph?osophy, 98.</page><page sequence="4">184 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy believes that among the things Socrates taught us is that "playfulness is quite compatible with seriousness." ... the philosopher's seriousness need not consist in the unhumorous insistence that he must be right. He need not even attach ultimate significance to right opinions. He may be serious in his determination to change other men by making them less irrational, and in his willingness to be changed himself in the course of his inquiries.7 Self-transcending humor can of course be a valuable element in correcting one's own tendencies to intellectual dogmatism and solemnity, while forms of humor such as irony and satire can in appropriate contexts be very effective rhetorical devices in the critical exposure of error. Kaufmann, like Nietzsche, mainly employs the latter?quite ably and at times to devastating effect. Arguing for the importance of discussing views one rejects, Kaufmann also suggests that "Polemic recaptures the excitement of the search for truth."8 He engages in it vigorously?although in the main not, I think, unfairly or ungenerously?in discussing philosophy, religion, and theology. Playfulness and polemics are also closely connected with literary style, and Kaufmann considers questions of style important to philosophical writing?as his own prose style and imaginative experimentation with a variety of literary forms attest. 2. The trouble with "isms." Kaufmann's understanding of philosophy made him suspicious and critical of labels or "isms." He saw them as inherently in tension with the comprehensively critical task of philosophy, and as functioning to constrict people's intellectual horizons and originality. Perhaps the single best example of the common lack of high standards in questions of honesty is our tendency to think in labels. Terms like existentialism, pragmatism, and empiricism.. . are, more often than not, so many excuses for not considering individual ideas on their merits and for not exposing oneself to the bite of thought.. .. These labels have some uses that are perfectly legitimate, but frequently they function as an aid to thoughtlessness and permit people to appear to think when they are merely talking.9 7.

The Faith of a Heretic, 27.</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 15, No. 2, May 1994 185 Kaufmann's portrayals of analytic philosophy and existentialism in Critique of Religion and Philosophy afford us concrete models of his analysis of philosophical "isms."10 He shows (writing in the late 1950s) how both movements have created their own philosophical subculture: with leaders who have shaped things not only by their approach to philosophy but also by their personality, followers whose "discipleship" can look to the outsider a lot like slavishness and idolatry, a vocabulary that becomes an identifying in-group jargon, a self-serving interpretation of the history of philosophy, and a self-limiting perspective on philosophical questions and problems?all of which, Kaufmann argues, give expression implicitly or explicitly to a vision of what it is to be human. In his sketch of G. E. Moore, and in sections entitled "The British Vision of Man" and "Donnish Doubt," Kaufmann exposes what he believes to be the limited view of philosophy and of the human that characterizes analytic philosophy, as when he observes: One of the most important functions of philosophy is to scrutinize beliefs and arguments, and to exercise a certain skill in showing up fallacies. From Berkeley and Hume to Broad and Ryle, British philosophy has excelled in this work.... The charge against this tradition should not be that it has been too critical.. . but that it has avoided an awareness of its relevance to experience, or indeed of the nature of the experiences to which various beliefs and arguments owe their significance. In this they have been un Socratic and aloof.11 But while the existentialists have been much more attuned to experience and "holistic" in their views of what it is to be human, Kaufmann criticizes existentialism for errors that lie at the opposite pole from those of analytic philosophy: ... First, it tends to ignore the ordinary for the extraordinary and to mistake the uncommon for the rule. Secondly, it does not demand of itself, let alone achieve, the greatest possible clarity of which its often difficult subject matter is capable.12 With his characteristic comprehensiveness, Kaufmann has praise for both traditions and for individual exemplars such as Wittgenstein and Sartre. 10. Critique of Religion and Philosophy, 20-61. 11. Ibid., 43. 12. Ibid., 47.</page><page sequence="6">186 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy But he persuasively makes his point that for all their virtues, philosophical "isms" exhibit tendencies to narrowness and partiality that are fundamentally at odds with philosophy's commitment to an open and critical approach to knowledge. 3. Radical empiricism as "ism." From the standpoint of a "radical empiricism" shaped by James, Dewey, and Whitehead, Kaufmann's critical description of empiricism as "ism," in a section called "Empiricism as Empiricide," is unsatisfactory. Viewing James and Dewey entirely under the rubric of pragmatism and apparently oblivious to their dramatic revisions of the empiricist understanding of "experience," Kaufmann describes only classical empiricism and positivism, and his criticisms would be fully shared by radical empiricists. He argues that classical empiricism's "attempts] at logical reconstruction of our ideas" out of sense impressions atomistically conceived impose upon experience a highly selective and reductionists theory, and thus ironically constitute a flight from concrete experience.13 He also points to the inadequacy of empiricist efforts to deal with areas of experience such as the religious and the aesthetic: "The intense experiences of individuals?the lust for knowledge, the passion to create, the deep disturbance of the confrontation with great works of art, moral despair, or any inkling of the numinous?all this is foreign to empiricism."14 (He faults the existentialists, by contrast, for concentrating "almost exclusively on the most intense experiences."15) Radical empiricists will find comfort and support in Kaufmann's call for a "new empiricism which neither flees experience nor ravishes it but tries to do justice to it,"16 and with considerable justice will claim to represent that "new empiricism." At the same time, radical empiricists may usefully imagine a Kaufmann fully knowledgable about this "new empiricism" who would play the same sort of gadfly he did with regard to classical empiricism, analytic philosophy, and existentialism. An especially helpful exercise in self criticism would be to compose a Kaufmann-style portrait of the radical empiricist intellectual subculture. The movement has its clearly-identified leaders (religious empiricists will want to include such names as Meland, Loomer, and Wieman), and its followers who expend a good bit of energy in expounding and critically reworking the leaders' ideas and arguments. There is a vocabulary bequeathed by the leaders (here Whitehead is perhaps especially but by no means uniquely important), and a community who 13. Ibidv 36. 14. Ibid., 46. 15. Ibid., 47. 16. Ibid., 37.</page><page sequence="7">Vol 15, No. 2, May 1994 187 know how to share it over food and wine as well as in meetings and journals. Crucially important to the radical-empiricist self-portrait will be the attempt to answer the question, In what ways is this philosophical framework limiting? What questions does it not ask but should? What resources might it draw on that it does not? To what extent does its vocabulary limit its account of the world? To what extent do its assumptions (for example, naturalism) narrow the range of ontological understanding? Are its methods the only really adequate ones? Do they close off certain possibilities, or constrain what data are attended to and how? And finally: What vision of the human is expressed through radical empiricist assumptions, language, and methods, and is it sufficiently "whole"? 4. Against theology. Those radical empiricists who consider themselves religious empiricists, involved in the philosophy of religion and constructive theology, will, I think, find Kaufmann's critical reflections on theology?and within that context on the problem of the word "God"?both provocative and valuable. I have simply taken the title of a chapter of The Faith of a Heretic as my title for this section of my paper, and it expresses quite succinctly Kaufmann's attitude toward the whole theological enterprise. He considered theology, understood as an intellectual enterprise?which he always distinguished from religion?to be inescapably dishonest. (Since Christianity early and explicitly appropriated Plato's term and has been probably the most theological of all religions, when Kaufmann speaks of "theology" he almost always means "Christian theology.") At one point Kaufmann summarizes succinctly his three general objections to theology: . .. First, theology is of necessity denominational. Second, theology is essentially a defensive maneuver. Third, it is almost always time-bound and dated quickly.17 Kaufmann borrows the political term "gerrymandering" to characterize theology, by which he means interpreting everything in such a way as to give one's own position an unfair advantage. "Unlike historical and philological scholarship in the employ of conscientious efforts at interpretation, the theologian's method is not designed to uncover the original intent and meaning of the quoted passages."18 The reason theologians gerrymander is that "They set themselves an impossible task 17. Ibid., 221. 18. The Faith of a Heretic, 106.</page><page sequence="8">188 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy that cannot be solved with sound methods: to present to us 'the message' of the New Testament, indeed of the whole Bible."19 Kaufmann documents these characterizations by examining and quoting substantially from theologians from Augustine and Aquinas to Tillich, Bultmann, and Niebuhr. He is particularly effective in exposing the distortions in standard Christian theological interpretations of the Hebrew Bible and the Jewish tradition. Kaufmann rejects the enterprise of classical natural theology with familiar arguments: "From the facts of nature one can infer further facts of nature, but one cannot with any certainty infer anything beyond nature, not even with probability."20 In the final analysis, furthermore, natural theology always falls back on dogmatic theology: ".. . it is never really the facts of nature that determine what is invoked [in the conclusions to the classical arguments], but some preconceived ideas mediated by religion."21 In distinguishing theology from religion, Kaufmann insists that a great deal of religion is anti-theological, and his favorite examples of anti theological religion are the Hebrew prophets, Job, and what he sees as a dominant impulse in the Jewish tradition. He explains what he means by "anti-theological" in the following passage: "In the Prophets and in parts of the New Testament?though certainly only in parts?love, justice, and humility appear to be all that is asked of man, and questions of belief entirely peripheral, while precise formulations about God . .. are altogether out of the picture."22 Clearly, then, he does not mean by "theology" any and every expression (to use H. R. Niebuhr's phrase) of "faith reasoning." Rather he means (1) a central emphasis on (correct) beliefs, and (2) the disciplined endeavor to systematize and rationalize such beliefs. Christianity, according to Kaufmann, is an inescapably theological religion?and that is exactly its main problem. ". . . [A] Christian may choose to reject theology. . . . But in that case he gives up Christianity, though in some laudatory senses of the word he may be a better Christian than some theologians."23 In "A Dialogue Between Satan and a Theologian," Satan, speaking for "devil's advocate" Kaufmann, makes a single statement that reveals much about Kaufmann's characterization of theology, his distinction between religion and theology, and (to anticipate) his approach to the problem of God and his own relationship to religion. Sounding very much like 19. Ibid., 109. 20. Ibid., 91. 21. Ibid., 92. 22. Ibid.,128. 23. Ibid., 130.</page><page sequence="9">Vol 15, No. 2, May 1994 189 Matthew Arnold, Satan remarks that "Theology is a misguided attempt to make poetry scientific, and the result is neither science nor poetry"24 While acknowledging that much theology has historically exhibited such defects, the contemporary liberal theologian?and particularly the theologian in the empiricist-naturalist tradition, whose "denominational" ties and allegiances may be minimal or non-existent?may well object to important features of Kaufmann's overall description of theology, and further contend that Kaufmann's identification of theology with these characteristics unfairly generalizes about and hypostasizes what has been a demonstrably self-correcting intellectual endeavor. But the strength of Kaufmann's portrayal is precisely that it is, to a documentable and somewhat dismal extent, an accurate description of theology as it has articulated itself for 1900 years. Furthermore, Kaufmann goes to some lengths to demonstrate that modern liberal forms of theology have been just as guilty of "gerrymandering" as classical and conservative forms. Theology has historically been a form of Christian reflection?"faith seeking understanding"?but even if we universalize the term beyond Christianity and think of it as systematic reflection on the grounds, meanings, and implications of any religious tradition by one who stands within that tradition, we are still left with the fact that historically and to the present day theology is by definition "denominational"?a form of "ism." It is the self-understanding of a religious tradition, with all the tendencies to narrowed focus and self-serving exegesis and argument which that has almost inevitably involved. Within Christianity, over the centuries, that has of course further subdivided into Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox and Protestant theologies, and further into Lutheran and Calvinist and Methodist theologies. What would a "non-denominational"?a religiously "global" or "ecumenical"?theology be? Do not these juxtapositions simply produce an oxymoron? If they do not, then the person who believes in the possibility of such a redefinition of theology must describe it and show how it differs from the philosophy of religion. This seems to me to be an especially acute question for religious liberals generally, and religious empiricists specifically, who see themselves as engaged in constructive theology but who want to be truly universal in scope. At a still deeper level Kaufmann raises the issue of the whole point of theology as he conceives it. Theology not only distorts, it "de-existentializes" religion, draining the lifeblood from what are imaginative outpourings of human experience. In a number of places Kaufmann expresses things in such a way as to suggest a large measure of agreement with Martin Buber's 24. Critique of Religion and Philosophy, 238; original italicized.</page><page sequence="10">190 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy famous statement in land Thou (which Kaufmann translated) that God "may properly only be addressed, not expressed." (Kaufmann's discussion of the Book of Job in a section of Critique of Religion and Philosophy entitled "Suffering and the Bible," to which I shall refer in the conclusion of my paper, is an excellent example of his rejection of theology on this point.) Furthermore, Kaufmann contends that theology as an intellectual enterprise is massively irrelevant to what actually goes on in religion?even in Christianity?and that among most believers it is politely tolerated but not of interest. These are sobering judgments which I suggest that even empiricist theologians do well to ponder. The first demands a reasonable accounting of the commitment to redescribing existential religious expressions in the more abstract vocabulary of a philosophical naturalism. The second raises the embarrassing and usually tacit question, If theology serves the church (however broadly defined), to whom are theologians talking except to one another? 5. The essential ambiguity of "God." It is in a chapter of Critique of Religion and Philosophy entitled "God, Ambiguity, and Theology"25 that Kaufmann most fully develops his analysis of the meaning of "God" and what it means to say that "God exists." His approach bears similarities to the sort of analytic philosophy of religion, inspired by the later Wittgenstein, that we see in D. Z. Phillips's Faith and Philosophical Enquiry1* and Paul van Buren's The Edges of Language? The foundation of Kaufmann's discussion is the fact that everyone raised in the Jewish or Christian traditions, or in the cultures dominated by them, learns the meaning of "God" almost entirely from the Jewish and Christian scriptures as mediated by those communities of interpretation. In the biblical literature "God" is a proper name for a highly complex individual who appears and acts in quite varied ways in "widely different contexts and . . . radically divergent situations,"28 who speaks and is spoken to in visions, dreams, prayer, and worship?all related in widely diverse writings that span 1200 years of religious history and development. Hence "statements about God belong to a universe of discourse which has its own characteristic conventions"29?the biblical writings and, deriving from them, the Jewish and Christian traditions of interpretation?and we can determine correct and incorrect usage within this universe of discourse: 25.

Ibid., 175.</page><page sequence="11">Vol. 15, No. 2, May 1994 191 Much discourse about God is therefore meaningful and even verifiable in an important sense without implying that God does in fact exist. In some kinds of discourse statements about God are legitimately verified by references to the Bible, or found false because they are in conflict either with express assertions or with implications of some passages in Scripture. In other kinds of discourse statements about God are found to be true or false by referring back to the traditions of a religious community or denomination. In both cases, disagreement may be frequent... . For all that, there is an area of agreement, and some propositions about God would be considered true by almost everyone brought up against the background of the Bible, others false. All this is independent of the question whether God exists.30 But what about the question, Does God exist? Given the rich polyvocality of "God" in the biblical universe of discourse whence we all learned to use the name?a polyvocality compounded by centuries of Jewish and Christian biblical interpretation?Kaufmann suggests that the question whether God "really" exists "has no clear meaning."31 Elsewhere he says that the reason is precisely that the word is "overcharged with meaning"32 in its original and historic contexts. Theological definitions of God and proofs for God's existence inevitably abstract out certain features from the complex and ambiguous mosaic portrayed in the biblical literature. While these developments have been understandable and in a sense inevitable, they have created a situation in which the questions of not only the nature but also the existence of God are highly ambiguous and the answers given to them misleading. One of Kaufmann's main criticisms of modern theologians is that they reinterpret traditional religious language to mean something quite different from its historic usages, and then either practice "doublespeak" between classroom and congregation or else claim that what they mean is what the language really meant all along. Kaufmann characterizes?some will say somewhat unfairly?this hermeneutical strategy in the context of a critical discussion of Paul Tillich's Dynamics of Faith: ... he redefines such terms as faith and heresy, atheism and revelation. It turns out that the man who accepts the ancient beliefs of Christendom, the Apostles' Creed, or Luther's articles of 30. Ibid., 176. 31. Ibid., 177. 32. Ibid., 180.</page><page sequence="12">192 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy faith may well be lacking faith, while the man who doubts all these beliefs but is sufficiently concerned to lie awake nights worrying about it is a paragon of faith.33 Kaufmann makes a discerning and perhaps uncomfortable observation when he describes the liberal theologian's continuing attachment to theology in terms of "childhood associations": What one is conscious of is not a strenuous intellectual effort but rather a wealth of childhood associations that evoke a sense of fellowship with others, past and present, and the reassurance that we are far from alone. It feels fine, but is it honest? And if one has a highly sensitive intellectual conscience, does it still feel fine?34 Why do theologians whose ontological views are indistinguishable from those of philosophical secularists want to continue engaging in "God-talk" and trying to make sense out of the religious symbols and traditions? Does this loyalty to the theological profession amount to anything more than nostalgia for and an unwillingness to let go of one's religious background? Is it simply an uneasy compromise between adhering to impossible beliefs and the full demands of intellectual honesty, motivated whether consciously or unconsciously by personal affection and respect for one's religious heritage? I have pondered this question a good deal in the light of my own experience as well as the experience of friends and acquaintances who engage in the philosophy of religion and theology. In the conclusion of my essay I shall mention Kaufmann's own resolution of these issues. It will come as no surprise by this point that Kaufmann's criticisms of theological oversimplification of "God" and "God exists" include theological redefinitions past and present: The use of "God" as a synonym for being-itself, or for the "pure act of being," or for nature, or for scores of other things for which other terms are readily available, cannot be disproved but only questioned as pettifoggery. The assertion that God exists, if only God is taken in some such Pickwickian sense, is false, too: not false in the sense of being incorrect, but false in the sense of being misleading and to that extent deceptive.35 33.

Ibid., 139-40.</page><page sequence="13">Vol. 15, No. 2, May 1994 193 In this passage Kaufmann posthumously throws down the gauntlet at the feet of contemporary liberal theology generally, and specifically of religious empiricists who identify God with nature or events and processes within nature. His challenge?not surprisingly after his characterization of theology?is not only that such redefinition is univocal, stipulative, and honorific, but that it is deceptive. In a "Dialogue Between Satan and a Christian," Kaufmann has the Christian tell what he means when he says "God exists." The Christian plausibly?and eloquently?interprets it in terms of statements about his own existence, as for example: God exists?that means: life is bearable, the reality of everyday life is not the only reality .. . our ideals, whatever they are, have authority; the passion for justice, however conceived, is no mere quixotism. . . . . .. God exists?that means: I shall not want, I will fear no evil, the ocean and the mountains hold no terror for me, nor does man. .. .36 To all of which Satan/Kaufmann quite happily assents, since it simply confirms his own conclusion (reminiscent of John Wisdom's "Gods") that "Theism is a language, a way of speaking, rather than a fact."37 The whole drift of Kaufmann's discussion of the meaning of "God" will strike many as problematic or wrongheaded in the extreme. Recalling his emphasis on the critical, gadfly task of philosophy, however, I suggest that it is valuable and provocative as a challenge to theology and the philosophy of religion. Particularly helpful, I think, is his reminding us that the biblical literature and the Jewish and Christian traditions of biblical interpretation continue to be the living context in which most people in our civilization learn what "God" means and how to use the term. What indeed is the relationship between what theologians say and the "field" on which this "game" is concretely played? Are theologians really at liberty to play the Red Queen and decree that "'God' means what I say it means"? And what if nobody pays any attention, or is mystified over why anyone would want to define what he or she has learned to think of as "God" in such a curious way? Kaufmann's arguments that the term "God" and the statement "God exists" are essentially ambiguous in the light of the foundational and paradigmatic usage in the biblical universe of discourse?that "God" and its 36. Critique of Religion and Philosophy, 246. 37. Ibid., 249.</page><page sequence="14">194 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy uses are in some primary sense "overdetermined"?also seem to me to demand serious consideration by theologians. Is affirming or rejecting "God" simply being able or not able to speak a certain language, to share in a particular community of discourse? Or does it also involve philosophical and theological analysis and redefinition? If the latter, what is the relationship between the analysis and redefinition on the one hand and the religious communities, with their heritage of scripture and tradition, on the other? 6. The faith of a heretic. How, finally, did Walter Kaufmann resolve his passionate but skeptical engagement with religion in his own thought and life? For the most part I shall let him speak for himself, adding only my observation that, in his beliefs?often eloquently and even lyrically expressed?as in some of his criticisms, I hear the voice of a kindred spirit. In a chapter of The Faith of a Heretic on 'Suffering and the Bible," Kaufmann remarks, after a provocative examination of the Book of Job, "The only theism worthy of our respect believes in God not because of the way the world is made but in spite of that. The only theism that is no less profound than the Buddha's atheism is that represented in the Bible by Job and Jeremiah."38 He continues: Their piety is a cry in the night, born of suffering so intense that they cannot contain it and must shriek, speak, accuse, and argue with God?not about him?for there is no other human being who would understand, and the prose of dialogue could not be faithful to the poetry of anguish. In time, theologians come to wrench some useful phrases out of Latin versions of a Hebrew outcry, blind with tears, and try to win some argument about a point of dogma. Scribes, who preceded them, carved phrases out of context, too, and used them in their arguments about the law. But for all that, Jewish piety has been a ceaseless cry in the night, rarely unaware of "all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun," a faith in spite of, not a heathenish, complacent faith because.39 Kaufmann's admiration for the Hebrew Bible and the Jewish heritage is obvious throughout his works, and in his comparative observations Christianity suffers?both for its distortions of Judaism and for its less humane and more theological character as a fellow heir and interpreter of the biblical traditions. As the passage above suggests, by comparison with 38. The Faith of a Heretic, 168. 39. Ibid., 168.</page><page sequence="15">Vol 15, No. 2, May 1994 195 Christianity Judaism has been a notably untheological religion, its hermeneutical discussions quite different in character and often over issues of practice. Kaufmann the "heretic" calls himself an "infidel" in Critique of Religion and Philosophy, and has a section on "infidel piety," which he calls an "antitheological extension of Jewish piety." Here we find one of the most impassioned and personal of Kaufmann's "confessions" of his own "faith": While refusing to permit himself the least ambiguity in matters of faith, a man may nevertheless find that some kind of religious language, both in its traditional form as we find it most notably in the Bible .. . and in spontaneous outbursts, now blasphemous, now desperate, is emotionally more adequate for him, more of a relief for an overflowing heart, than any other idiom he commands. If he could compose a first-rate poem, that might be still more adequate; but he cannot, and in his present quandary he addresses God. He does not believe anything about God and accepts no dogmas of any sort. He does not feel more tolerant of the theologians than before. He turns to God as one might turn to a Shakespearean outcry or a Negro spiritual or a walk up a mountain, without belief.... The dialogue without belief ... is an explosion of the heart, a bursting of its walls, a breakdown of inhibitions. One does not relax one's honesty; on the contrary, one does not permit one's beliefs or disbeliefs to get in the way of an honest expression of one's inmost heart. And if, more rarely, one should feel addressed, one listens first and asks questions later. . .. We can keep questioning, making absolutely everything subject to critical reflection, without necessarily sacrificing our emotional life and becoming intellectual shadows. We need not choose between thinking and feeling. Nor is it true that those who think most feel least. ... There are those who, without belief, find themselves addressing and addressed spontaneously, now often, now rarely, and reflect on these experiences instead of arbitrarily limiting themselves to the more usual forms of sense experience. They . .. simply feel that in all honesty they must seek to do justice to them.40 40. Critique of Religion and Philosophy, 286.</page><page sequence="16">196 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Also worthy of comment is that here Kaufmann integrates into one sustained statement the elements I have been separately examining in this essay. Alternatively, Kaufmann characterizes his perspective as a "tragic view of the world." Such a view, he says, includes four characteristics: first, failure is compatible with (human) greatness; secondly, greatness, like the universe itself, is in the final analysis mysterious; thirdly, failure is final; and fourthly, failure is inevitable.41 Kaufmanns discussions of the Western tradition of tragic drama, the incompatibility of tragedy and Christianity, and tragic elements in the thought of writers such as Freud, are characteristically rich and illuminating. Even here, in spelling out what he means by a tragic view of the world, Kaufmann seems to me to issue a challenge to religious empiricists. Is not any naturalistic interpretation of the world a tragic view of life, on these terms? If not, why not? Should not religious and theological naturalists be more forthcoming about it if this is indeed the case? And what advantage does a religious naturalism have over Kaufmann's classical humanism? How indeed does it differ from it in any meaningful way as a religious perspective, if failure is final and inevitable on both views? For Kaufmann's final word I return to "Suffering and the Bible," where he concludes with remarks about Job which again constitute a confession of his own "faith" and his ideal of a human life. Referring to Job's statement, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return; the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD" (1:21), Kaufmann writes: In the form of an anthropomorphic faith, these words express one of the most admirable attitudes possible for man: to be able to give up what life takes away, without being unable to enjoy what life gives us in the first place; to remember that we came naked from the womb and shall return naked; to accept what life gives us as if it were God's own gift, full of wonders beyond price; and to be able to part with everything. To try to fashion something from suffering, to relish our triumphs, and to endure defeats without resentment: all that is compatible with the faith of a heretic42 41.
