<plain_text><page sequence="1">Imago Dei, Paramam Sdmyam: Hindu Light on a Traditional Christian Theme Francis X. Clooney, SJ Then God said, "Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth." So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them (Genesis \. 26-27). l When the seer sees that Person, the golden-coloured, the creator, the Lord, as the womb of Brahman; then, shaking off the good and the bad, that wise man becomes spotless, and attains the highest sameness (Mundaka Upanisad 3.1 .3).2 A Modest Starting Point: A Christian Understanding of imago Dei For a conference of Christian theologians in the spring of 20083 I was asked to present a plenary paper on "the imago Dei in light of Hinduism." The Genesis text cited above intriguingly indicates that the supreme, transcendent God, who makes the world out of a chaos that is tantamount to nothing at all makes humankind, male and female, in his own image and likeness. Over the millennia, the passage has challenged preachers and theologians to explain in what way humans are like God, in God's image - while yet steering away from any seeming reduction of God to an anthropomorphic imitation of the human, while yet too not emptying the text of its meaning. In addressing the topic, as in the pages that follow, I surveyed a range of possibilities and then focused on the Mundaka Upanisad passage that I have also cited above, read in accord with Vedanta Desika's interpretation of it. This essay, prompted by a specific interest of a Christian theological community, also reflects my choice to read together the Genesis and Mundaka texts, with a sense that using a Hindu text to illumine a biblical text is only a first stage of a process International Journal of Hindu Studies 12, 3: 227-55 © 2008 Springer DOI 10.1007/sll407-008-9063-y</page><page sequence="2">228 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ that subsequently includes a fresh return to the Christian side of the comparison with new expectations that have arisen in light of the Hindu text and issues specific to it. I took up this rather comparative challenge - complex in detail and method - because I am interested in the creative possibilities that arise in reflection on such themes across the boundaries between Hindu and Christian traditions, when com- parison is undertaken with sensitivity to necessary subtlety and fluidity of such practices: one always gets more than anticipated and in unexpected ways. Compara- tive reflection invariably leads us into uncharted territory, as unanticipated similari- ties and differences come to the fore in and after the study has begun. This particular theme, moreover, is interesting because it gives us a fresh insight into how to think about the divine-human relationship in the Indian context - and then, as we shall see, into the Christian understanding of the divine-human relationship. It is necessary first to see some of the options by which we can take up this topic, so that we can then intelligently narrow the topic for a more fruitful, specific reflec- tion. This essay therefore first surveys some Hindu resources pertinent to the imago Dei theme, then studies a single example of divine-human sameness in more detail, and finally introduces an unexpected correlation with a Catholic Christian under- standing of the conformity of the human to the divine. I must first note, however, what the theme seems to have meant in Genesis itself. For this I have relied a recent study of the subject, J. Richard Middleton's The Liberating Image (2005), a careful reading of the Genesis text in its ancient Near East context that is also cognizant of the long discussion of the text and theme in the Christian tradition. Middleton rejects the idea that being in God's image means sharing the divine essence or some kind of visual resemblance. He points rather to the notion of human participation in divine action - being-in-God's image is a matter of representing God, acting-for God. This summary statement from his intro- duction is helpful in summarizing his perspective and guiding our comparative study: On the one hand, careful exegesis of Genesis 1 :26-28, in conjunction with an intertextual reading of the symbolic world of Genesis 1, does indeed suggest that the imago Dei refers to human rule, that is, the exercise of power on God's behalf in creation. This may be articulated in two different, but complementary, ways. Said one way, humans are like God in exercising royal power on earth. Said in another way, the divine ruler delegated to humans a share in his rule of the earth. Both are important ways of expressing the meanings of the imago Dei. The first expression - the notion of likeness to the divine ruler - suggests the image as "representational," indicating a similarity or analogy between God and humans. The second expression - the delegation of, or sharing in, God's rule - suggests the image as "representative," designating the responsible office and task entrusted to humanity in administering the earthly realm on God's behalf. But these expres- sions are not simply alternative; they are integrally connected. It is precisely</page><page sequence="3">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 229 because the representational aspect of the image consists in a functional similarity or analogy between God and humanity, specifically concerning the exercise of (royal) power, that the image can be articulated also as representative, referring to the human office of representing God's rule/power in the world. A royal-func- tional reading of the imago Dei is therefore essentially confirmed (Middleton 2005: 88; emphasis in original). In subsequent chapters Middleton then develops a contrast with the Near Eastern representations that privileged the king as the foremost image of God. In the later part of the book he reflects on the nature of divine action as exemplified in Genesis 1 and how humans are to act in accord with/response to that compassionate divine action, in the prolonged "seventh day" that is human history (Middleton 2005: 29 1).4 This firm emphasis on divine and human action gives us a guide when starting our search for parallels in the Hindu context by shifting our attention from a search for static and observable resemblances between the divine and human to acts of imita- tion and representation. While the imago Dei theme first of all prompts us to think about Hindu images of divine persons, how the human and divine resemble one another, careful reflection on the imago Dei as interpreted by Middleton allows us to focus on a more particular set of questions: what is the process by which humans become increasingly like God, what are the ontological and experiential grounds of this assimilation, and what is the end point of the process? Some Initial Thoughts on imago Dei in Hinduism A key element in any comparative project is the decision, or decisions, to be made about where to make a provisional connection with the "other" tradition from which one hopes to learn. Any parallels we draw require of us some tolerance for gener- alization and for analogy, given differences in how Hindus and Christians have construed (in whatever language) the meaning of words such as "God." To draw comparisons of this sort is inevitably to engage in a constructive effort, drawing Indian materials into service with respect to the imago Dei theme, drawn from so different a context. When we turn to the Indian context, and its Hindu traditions in particular, there are a number of avenues for reflection on the image of God. In the following several pages, without claiming to make any original contribution, I intro- duce a few candidates that promise interesting comparative possibilities. Thereafter I focus, as is necessary for fruitful comparison, on a single instance worthy of closer examination, one that in turn changes the intent of our return to the Christian tradi- tion. A promising and very famous starting point might of course be representations of the cosmic person, source of the universe, from the dissection of whom the world in all its parts arises; and this is best represented in the "Hymn of the Person" (Purusa Sukta), Rg Veda 10.90:</page><page sequence="4">230 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ Thousand-headed is the Man with a thousand eyes, a thousand feet; encompassing the Earth all sides, he exceeded it by ten fingers' breadth (1). The Man, indeed, is this All, what has been and what is to be, the Lord of the immortal spheres which he surpasses by consuming food (2). Such is the measure of his might, and great still than this is Man. All beings are a fourth of him, three fourths are the immortal in heaven... (3). This evolved Man, then first born, they besprinkled on the sacred grass. With him the Gods performed the sacrifice, as did also the heavenly beings and seers... (7). When they divided up the Man, into how many parts did they divide him? What did his mouth become? What his arms? What are his legs called? What his feet? (11). His mouth became the Brahmin, his arms became the warrior-prince, his legs the common man who plies his trade. The lowly serf was born from his feet (12). What is notable in this hymn, beyond the origins of the world from this Person, is the interplay of cosmos and person and the emphasis on sacrificial destruction and reconstruction rather than visual resemblance. It is only in the act - in a ritual and therefore social act - that the resemblance is constructed. As the Purusa Sukta may be taken to suggest, beings exist from and as a component part of the Person, not as the Person or even a microcosm of the Person. In theistic traditions such as the Vaisnava, however, the cosmic Person has also been interpreted as God and the natural and social order has been envisioned as existing entirely within the reality of that Person. Later on we might also discover the possibility of meditative constructions of the microcosm that draw upon the idea and image of this cosmic person; by ritual practice a person acquires a divine form, as his and her identity is transformed into that of a divine identity. For an example of this we might refer to the famous Buddhist stupa at Barabudur in Indonesia and also, by extension, to the broader ancient Indian project of constructing personal identity in accord with and even as a divine reality. Such are the possibilities that have been famously meditated on by Paul Mus in his Barabudur (1998). Ancient sacrifices, including human sacrifices, are later replaced, replicated in more regular (and less violent) fashion in the com-</page><page sequence="5">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 231 plex construction of altars such as the fire altar (agni-cayana), which is shaped as a bird, made of numerous bricks and in five layers: The agnicayana ends up by identifying part by part the sacrificer to Prajapati [the creator God] through the interplay of the structural parts. When recomposing Prajapati and identifying oneself to him progressively as the reconstructions proceeds, one ends up with identity of the persons. If the sacrificer is allowed to reach this union it is because Agni [the fire god, the fire] gave him the example of how to do it. Previously when Agni was dispersed between the gods of all the [directions], Agni became their equal successively, and finally, having absorbed all of them, found himself become Prajapati; at the same time Prajapati, first of all dispersed, and who had lost himself in this dispersion, was capable of finding himself again in the person of Agni.... Agni only acquires the cosmic body in so far as he identifies himself with the mystical body formed by the diagram of the positions occupied by the gods of the [directions], in other words in so far as he identifies himself with the altar. And Prajapati who himself is lost only finds himself in this Agni, who has already reached the cosmic body, by identifying himself in his turn with the altar, ritual substitute of the cosmic diagram, and so of the world (Mus 1998: 132). The ritually constructed micro- and macro-cosmic paradigm enacted in the recon- struction of self in accord with the building of the fire altar is, with variants, repli- cated throughout the Indian tradition. For instance, Hindu and Buddhist Tantric traditions show us practices that enable practitioners to achieve divinization, becoming a visualized, contemplated divinity, an imago Dei (see, for instance, Muller-Ortega 2002). A particularly intriguing and well-known variant on the same theme is that of the ardhanarlsvara, the divine person represented as both male and female, thus encom- passing in wholeness the reality divided into male and female. A very old form of this is implicit in the Brhaddranyaka Upanisad, where the original person becomes male and female and rediscovers himself in their reunion: In the beginning, this [world] was just a single body (dtman), shaped like a man. He looked around and saw nothing but himself. The first thing he said was, "Here I am!" and from that the name "I" came into being. Therefore, even today when you call someone, he first says, "It's I," and then states whatever other name he may have. That first being receive the name "man" (purusa), because ahead (purva) of all this he burnt up (us) all evils. ... He found no pleasure at all; so one finds no pleasure when one is alone. He wanted to have a companion. Now he was as large as a man and a woman in close embrace. So he split (pat) his body into two, giving rise to husband (pati) and wife (patni). Surely this is why Yajnavalkya used to say, 'The two of us are like two halves of a block." The space here, therefore, is completely filled by the</page><page sequence="6">232 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ woman. He copulated with her, and from their union human beings were born (1.4.1-3). While this Upanisadic motif cannot simply be recast as a portrayal of a male-female deity, it does resonate with traditions that have found a deity, £iva for instance, to be both male and female: An earring of bright new gold glows on one ear; a coiled conch shell sways on the other. On one side he chants the melodies of the ritual Veda, on the other, he gently smiles. Matted hair adorned with sweet konrai blossoms on one half of his head, and a woman's curls on the other, he comes. The one is the nature of his form, the other, of hers; and both are the very essence of his beauty.5 Or, again for the sake of finding analogies to Western discussions of imago Dei, we might consider the possibility of a more complete, perfect identification of self and the ultimate Reality. The radical non-dualist tradition known as Advaita Vedanta points to a perfect assimilation of the human to the divine as the unqualified, total, and final reality. It is rooted in a recognition of the divinity of the human, an already settled state that is made known by way of a purification, a stripping away of condi- tioning factors. This is either a radical fulfillment of the motif of the imago Dei or perhaps rather a move beyond it; with this ideal of absolute identity, Advaita marks a radical possibility that will remain marginal to this paper. In order to explore the resemblance of God and embodied beings in a mature theis- tic context, we might look at the creation of images and the spiritual expectations connected with that construction. It is of course tempting to see the construction of images/idols as an effort to (re-)make God in the human image, given that the temple images reflect divine persons in forms similar to human forms. The imitative process is subtler, though, and from a theological perspective highlights the divine intention to conform to human expectations:6 as we imagine God, so God becomes apparent to us. Visnudharmottara Purdna 103.16 renders as follows the value of constructing a temple image of gold: The lovely form of Visnu, his image, his pleasing face and glance - making this image in a way that pleases him, from gold or silver, he should then honor it, bow before it, love it, meditate on it. His flaws removed, he will then reach that form of Brahman.</page><page sequence="7">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 233 In a Tamil verse that the Srivaisnava Hindu tradition connects with the preceding, Poykai Alvar, a poet-saint, candidly admits that there is a divine accommodation to human preferences: Whichever form pleases his people, that is his form; whichever name pleases his people, that is his name; whichever way pleases his people who meditate without ceasing, that is his way - the One who holds the discus. The Srivaisnava theologian Appillai has this comment on Poykai Alvar's verse: Thus the Lord does not consider his own greatness, but holds as his own forms, names, deeds, etc., those that please people who take refuge in him. Thus Poykai AJvar reflects on and makes known the excellence of the nature of the image-form with which the Lord serves those who take refuge in him.7 These citations seem to allude to straightforward resemblance in the temple context, where images - idols - rather forthrightly represent the divine person in human form, but root this accommodation in divine intention as well as in a human predi- lection for the familiar and comprehensible. This is an imago hominis - God in the image of the human - that marks a divine accommodation to human need; it is a gracious act of response that does not require any essential or static likeness. To announce "We are like God" seems less bold if we understand ourselves to be speaking about the accommodating intent of a God choosing to be like us, in our image, and not merely about human constructions of God in a human image. Thus there are many avenues for thinking about the imago Dei in Hinduism, and in the preceding paragraphs I have indicated just a few. In the examples I have high- lighted, essential visible similarity is downplayed, while primacy is given to action that promotes resemblance-in-act and consequently in the features of persons defined as agents who by choice approximate one another in various ways. With this overview in the background - as was necessary for my original audi- ence, but also because we must see a wider set of possibilities before narrowing down our choices - I wish to focus on one particular text in its traditional location, with interest in a particular exploration of the divine-human relationship. I devote the bulk of my attention in the following pages to a particular section of one fourteenth-century South Indian, Srivaisnava text: chapter 22, the "The Perfect Experience of Brahman," in the Srlmad Rahasyatrayasdra (The Essence of the Three Auspicious Mysteries; henceforth Essence) of Vedanta Desika. As we shall see, this choice not only presents an interesting analogue to Christian reflection on the imago theme; Desika' s insights also have implications for where a Christian comparativist returns to the Christian tradition after actually learning from Hinduism.</page><page sequence="8">234 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ "Highest Sameness" to God in chapter 22 of the Srimad Rahasyatrayasdra of Vedanta Desika Vedanta Desika (Venkatanata, 1268-1369) was born in Tuppul, near Kanchipuram in today's South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, into an orthodox Srivaisnava Hindu family. His Srivaisnava tradition is a Hindu theological and spiritual tradition of great philosophical, theological, and spiritual interest. It traces itself to the exem- plary teacher (dcdrya) Ramanuja (1017-1137), in turn to Ramanuja's predecessors Alavantar and Nathamuni, and beyond them to the Tamil poet-saints, the eighth- tenth century dlvdrs - all, the faithful stress, inspired by the original grace and teaching of the divine couple, Narayana and Sri. Desika is central to this tradition and one of its leading figures. In the Essence he expounds Srivaisnavism's expec- tation regarding the final state of the liberated self, its eschatological fullness in union with Brahman, the absolute Reality which is personally invoked as Narayana, the Lord, consort of Sri Laksml. The Essence is by tradition one of his last works, his erudition in full flower; in terms of its style, presentation of ideas, and practical intent, it is also meant for a wide popular (though literate) audience. As a constructive text deeply indebted to tradition, it is first of all an exegesis of three holy (sacred, rahasya) mantras* central to the Srivaisnava tradition of South India. Srivaisnavism is an ancient South Indian tradition devoted to worship of Narayana as the sole God, along with his consort, Sri (Laksml). It draws on the Sanskrit and Tamil language traditions, explicating their truths and defending the coherence of a single creed expounded over the centuries in two languages. The three mantras are central to Srivaisnavism's theology, piety, and commentarial production.9 They are short, totaling only twenty-seven "commen- table" units. Compared with many other mantras, they are also relatively straight- forward, simple words expressive of praise of Lord Narayana, the Lord's invitation to the devotee to surrender completely, and the devotee's unqualified act of taking refuge in Narayana with the goddess Sri. The mantras chart the human acknowledg- ment of dependence on God, the divine and human exchange of commitments, and the divine promise of liberation and ultimate peace. They are considered by the Srivaisnava tradition to contain, in a particularly condensed and essential fashion, all that needs to be said about the human condition, the goal of life, the way to that goal, and obstacles thereto. Elucidated with the commentator's acute eye, they condense the ancient, large body of revelatory authoritative texts (sruti) and revered tradition (smrti), offering a succinct distillation of teachings that in turn can be expanded at great length. Desika invites his readers to understand, feel, and enact all necessary religious truths and values through the ideas, words, and actions inscribed in the words of the three mantras. Their theology is an implicit creedal formulation, and traditional teachers found the interpretation of them to be effective catechesis, in summary of the faith and practice of the tradition: to recite the mantras is, implicitly, to say and pray all that is necessary. They are more than containers for ideas, though; they are</page><page sequence="9">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 235 also effective with respect to the pedagogy and psychology of devotion. They are, or can be, prayers appropriate for devout recitation, regular moments in individuals' and communities' ongoing relation with the divine couple: praise, invitation to trust, and loving surrender. In Sanskrit, they distill a very orthodox tradition; meant for the widest of audiences, they return Sanskrit learning to the entire community. A reflec- tive appropriation of the mantras opens the way for the transformation of the life of a person who takes them to heart. Desika composed the Essence as a most comprehensive commentary on the mantras. It is an exegesis that is also filled out by explicit contextual attention to the accompanying philosophy and theology, the religious practice and communal values of South Indian Srivaisnavism. The thorough exegesis of the Tiru mantra, Dvaya mantra, and Carama Sloka occurs only in chapters 27, 28, and 29, but this is balanced and enriched by the "prose" narratives of chapters 3 to 19. Essence 3-6 offer philosophical and theological underpinnings for the entire project; 7-12 offer the logic and psychology of taking refuge; 13-19 spell out the manner and motive of a life lived in accord with the mantras. We thus have a series of intersecting perspec- tives: exegesis (27-29), doctrinal (3-6), psychological-spiritual context (7-12), ethical implications (13-19), and the transmission of tradition (30-31). The result is that the truth, the beneficial way, and the goal - geared respectively to the Tiru mantra, Dvaya mantra, and Carama Sloka - are explained variously throughout the Essence, seen over and over again from different perspectives. As a result, the attentive reader learns the truths to be affirmed, the practices to be undertaken, and the goal that concludes life's journey. Although our focus is on chapter 22, we must first take note of the basic divine- human relationship Desika explains earlier, in Essence 3 and 5, where the self is described in its basic and qualified resemblance to God. In Essence 3 ('The Distinctive Doctrine of Srivaisnavism"), Desika succinctly summarizes the divine-human relation. Between God and the human there is a fundamentally asymmetrical relationship, total freedom linked to total dependence. This is thematized as the relationship of "that upon which all others depend" and "that which depends on another" or, by way of a then-popular image, the relation of a sovereign ruler and all that he rules over. The relationship is asymmetrical, since humans are entirely dependent on God, who depends on none even if caring for all.10 All beings stand in this dependent relation to the Lord, but humans are distinctive because they are competent to be more than dependent, able to choose to serve the Lord freely: The Lord is the one to whom all belongs. [Sentient and non-sentient beings] exist by nature solely for this Other and for His purposes. In using them as His material, He is glorious.... Founded on the Lord as his foundation, the individual self gains its proper form in inseparability from the Lord, just like His knowledge and power. Belonging entirely to the Lord, to whom all belongs, the individual self has a taste for an ultimate goal such as is appropriate to his proper form and the goal</page><page sequence="10">236 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ suited to its appropriate self-understanding. Belonging entirely to the Lord, to whom all belongs, and being controlled by Him who is controller, he also knows the specific and perfect means which is suitable to the ultimate aim appropriate to his proper being.... Therefore follows that this conscious being has no other support, has no other purpose, and has no other refuge.11 In Essence 5 ("The Three Realities"), we learn that the essential nature of the individual self is knowledge (jndna) and bliss (ananda); and it is pure and atomic (minimal in spatial extension); these are its defining attributes. This reality, the individual self, exists as entirely dependent, only for the Lord, and it is unconditional as dependent on him alone. Thus, that it exists for the Lord is confirmed, as also is its existing for none other than the Lord. Subsidiary but essential features of con- scious existence, such as will and agency, also apply to God and humans who can and do choose to be in an enduring relationship. In addition to the fact that the humans are dependent, while the Lord is the one on whom all depends, there are certain differentiating factors: the Lord is all-pervasive, while individual selves are "atomic," occupying the smallest possible material space, and (as we shall see below) the Lord has a distinctive role with respect to the maintenance of the cosmos that is not shared with humans. To be human, then, is to exist entirely for the Lord and to find full satisfaction in the Lord; even if this is not necessarily "being in the divine image," it does none- theless indicate an innate, inherent conformity of the human to the divine. In none of this is any visual resemblance claimed; the relationship matters, not the particular configurations of the related persons as materially alike to one another. Nor does God create humans this way, since all beings exist eternally in this kind of relation- ship to the Lord. We must also notice that humans form a kind of mirror image of God, marked with symmetrical yet non-reciprocal relations between the divine and human persons. Highest Sameness In light of these starting points, we can now turn to the exposition of sameness (sdmya)12 in Essence 22, where Desika gives all this a definitive, eschatological focus, contemplating the individual self in its perfect and final form after radical surrender to the Lord with Sri LaksmI and after death.13 In Essence 22, Desika repeats the idea (stated in Essence 5) that although there are enduring differences between divine and human persons, they are ultimately entirely alike in their enjoyment of supreme bliss in union with one another, in Heaven. Whatever restrictions or incapacities had previously marked human beings give way, in that final state, to complete resemblance. This, I suggest, is a dynami- cally conceived and definitive assimilation of the human to the situation of imago Dei. The chapter's context is the moment when liberated souls enter Heaven, where they are to dwell forever in bliss with God. Desika here refines the notion of perfect,</page><page sequence="11">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 237 full experience, so as to maximize the divine-human relation, while yet adhering to the divine-human distinction. Here is the chapter's thematic opening verse: He is led by guides to the beloved of Laksmi possessed of varied glories in the region without dark taint, having reached there, his innate form becomes manifest, and its inherent perfection shines forth; his are the eight attributes14 and their fruits, he shares highest sameness, all talk of some cessation of enjoyment abandoned.15 The last line alludes to our key text, Mundaka Upanisad 3.3, which describes a process of assimilation to the Lord: When the seer sees that Person, the golden-coloured, the creator, the Lord, as the womb of Brahman; then, shaking off the good and the bad, that wise man becomes spotless, and attains the highest sameness (paramam sdmyam). The nature of this highest sameness - as it were, an eschatologically realized imago Dei - is the topic of Essence 22 and, as such, the major point of this paper. A brief detour is in order here. Between Desika and the Upanisad, there is a long history of interpretation, most pertinently, for our purposes, in the exegesis of his great predecessor, Ramanuja. In keeping with the theistic Vedanta tradition, Ramanuja defends a strong reading of sameness - a real assimilation of the human to the divine as the fulfillment of human being - but without conceding total identity or even total conformity of functions. At Brahma Sutra 4.4.4 ("In non-division, for it is seen"), the question is this: Does the individual self, when it has reached the highest light and released itself from all bondage, experience itself as separate (prthak) from the highest Self- or as non-separate (avibhakta) due to being a "mode" (prakdra) of that Self?16 First, Ramanuja gives an opposing interpretation in which the emphasis on the achievement of oneness in fact highlights the enduring nature of difference: [The adversary says that] the former view is the right one. From our understanding of authoritative texts and revered texts of tradition,17 [it is certain that] the released soul stands to the highest Self in the relation of fellowship (sdhitya), sameness (sdmya), equality of attributes (sddharmya) - and so experiences itself as separate (prthakbhutam anubhavati).</page><page sequence="12">238 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ In rebuttal, Ramanuja sets forth the position stated in the Brahma Sutra as his own favored position, emphasizing rather the identity implied by the same quotations mentioned by the adversary: Against this view the Sutra declares itself, "in non-division." The released soul is conscious of itself as non-divided from the highest Brahman. "For it is seen." That is, the self, having reached Brahman and freed itself from the obscuration of igno- rance, is seen as it truly is. Its true nature is expounded18 as having for its inner Self the highest Self, because it constitutes the body of that Self and is a mode of it. It experiences itself in non-division, saying, "I am Brahman" (Brhadaranyaka UpanisadlAAO). As for the texts that might be taken as indicating relationship: Where the texts speak of the soul's becoming the same as (sdmya), or having equal attributes to (sddharmya), Brahman, the meaning is that the proper nature of the individual soul is the same as that of Brahman (svarupam tatsamam) because it is its mode; it becomes the same in purity as Brahman after putting off its material body as a god, etc. The text declaring their being with one another intimates that the individual self, because it is a mode of Brahman, experiences the attributes [of Brahman].19 We are thus given - by Ramanuja, and still more clearly by Desika - several ways of assimilating the human to the divine: sharing attributes, conforming of proper form, identical purity, experiencing Brahman as Brahman experiences itself- or, more simply, sameness. Sameness in Bliss In Essence 22, implying20 Mundaka Upanisad 3.3 as his authority, Desika interprets the enjoyment of the liberated in relation to the Bliss of Brahman. At issue is the "sameness" or equality of all beings with God, an equality that, even in light of the asymmetrical relationship of Lord and self, is rooted in the belief that all come to share the same bliss as the Lord himself experiences. The first paragraph after the opening thematic verse sets the chapter's tone: If someone asks about the nature of the perfectly full experience of Brahman had by a person traveling by this special path. [The answer is:] For his unsurpassable enjoyment, with nothing at all lacking of the Lord's infinity of forms, qualities, expansive powers, and deeds, he gains hold of the Lord of all, in all places, times, and conditions. As the alvar sings [in TiruvaymoU 6.7.10]: Oh deities! I don't know what to think; the young doe with slender eyes is gone away,</page><page sequence="13">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 239 for she never, even for an instant, lets go the glance of the Lord whose eyes are lotuses, who possesses the whole world; she thinks nothing at all of our family's great disgrace, she's set on going to Kolur, his temple town.21 This experience is entirely the same for the Lord and for this self, and thus it is the "highest sameness."22 The point of the embedded quotation from Tiruvdymoli is that the young woman in love holds the Lord forever in her mind and heart, never letting go; and it is this deep apprehension of beauty and pleasure that is permanent, unchanging.23 The overall point is that there is a sameness in the bliss - in expanse, duration, enjoyment - shared by God and humans; the verse portrays that state as a moment of ecstasy extended eternally. It is notable too that perfect enjoyment is fulfilled in service of others. Those who are perfect remain oriented to the divine will and have their glory in conforming to it. Desika' s point is that in the positivity of the divine will, all becomes a matter of pleasure, a service that is freely chosen and enacted without dependence on previous karma: In his Sarandgati Gadya,24 Ramanuja has frequently mentioned that state which is the flood of special delight born of this perfectly full experience; this is the service that has been mentioned above. In the state of liberation, there is eating, etc., and meeting relatives, etc., such as are confirmed in the revelatory texts. These are rooted in the self's will in accord with the will of the Lord and without any dependence on karma in the form of merit and demerit. They are therefore not the fruits of karma, but rather are within that scope of that pure service that is the flood of experience. This attainment is the perfectly full experience of Brahman, culminating in acts of service enacted exactly as desired.25 The importance of freely elected service indicates again the intentionality of the divine-human relationship; it is a conscious and cooperative communion, wherein sameness is neither static nor necessary and inevitable; if it is eternal, this is because those enjoying it choose to share it forever. Arguing the Meaning of Sameness In the course of his exposition in Essence 22, Desika criticizes two interpretations of the ultimate human state that in his view cloud the meaning of highest sameness: that of Madhva, who held that there are gradations even in final bliss, and that of Samkara, who held that sameness indicates complete and perfect identity. In Hindu theologies familiar to Desika, sameness is subdivided into a series of graded states: sdlokya (sharing the same world/place as the Lord), sdmlpya (being near to the Lord), sdrupya (having the same form as the Lord26), and sdyujya (being</page><page sequence="14">240 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ in unity with the Lord27). With respect to these four terms, the Vedanta theologian Madhva is portrayed in Essence 22 as using them to postulate four permanent degrees of difference in proximity to the Lord and thus as rejecting the idea of equality in bliss. Desika does not refer to any particular Madhva text, but we can point to Madhva' s comments at Brahma Sutras 4.4.4, where Madhva quotes the Bhavisyat Parvan (or Purdna) to show that ultimate human bliss is only a small portion of the divine bliss: 'The liberated, having reached the highest Visnu, enjoy but a small measure of His enjoyments, exterior [to His essence]; but neither do they experience anything other than bliss, and so on."28 Then, at Brahma Sutras 4.4.19, Madhva gives a long citation from the Gdruda Purdna to show that various souls experience various degrees of bliss: Some meditate on the imperishable deity Hari, as the only self, and right here they are liberated and do not return; some are established in the Antariksa Loka, some in Svarga Loka, some in the Mahar Loka, some in the Jana Loka or in Tapas; some, very wise, are established in truth and go to the Ocean of Milk, and there, by the order of their rank and the greatness of their knowledge, go near [to Brahman]; some dwell in the same world (sdlokya), some gain similar form (sarupa); some are always near [Me] (sdmlpya) or ever in union (yoga) [with Me]. Yet differences persist after as well as before liberation:29 In eternal bliss, in enjoyment, and in knowledge, lordly power, and good qualities, all are endowed with a hundred good qualities, but each is greater than the one before. Those that are higher are worshipped by those below, and by all of them the four-faced (Brahma) is worshipped; each operates his own world, active just as before. Those in sdyujya enter the highest Self and come forth, and assume either forms of consciousness or material forms, and enjoy all blessings but a few; thus is their liberation.30 Before hearing Desika' s response, we should note that the fourfold terminology - sdlokya, sdmlpya, sdrupya, and sdyujya - in the background of Madhva' s view, is most clearly expressed in an older South Indian Saiva view whereby an elaborate matrix of gradations in approximation to Lord Siva is proposed. The authoritative interpretation found in Arujnanti Sivacarya's thirteenth-century Sivajndnasiddhiyar (8.2.18), a key commentary on Sivajndnabodham, suggests four ways to union with Siva, by four kinds of practice, and these are geared to the four states already</page><page sequence="15">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 241 noted:31 The Way Ways Culminating in Partial Bliss Constituting Highest Bliss "Those who Lm , „ „ f . t . , Lm Those who , If „ one performs „ work f in . this t . path , _ _ , , perform _ these this yoga of _ Those great in will surely , , be t . , .,..,, . . , , , . , T „ duties t . reach , eight .,..,, kinds, he this . . knowledge , , , in . the , Lords T „ f _ . , _ f A. „ , „, , , , x the f presence of _ gains . the , form _ reach f Siva A. world , „, (sdlokya) , , , x , „ ,.*...,«,, . ,/l. . . f „ . the , v pure one „ of ,.*...,«,, Siva himself (sdyujya) j jj . t (22). \ (Sivajndnasiddhiyar ,/l. . . f „ . t v pure w^x t w_x j jj t \ \ (Sivajndnasiddhiyar 0 /Ov (sdmipya) t w^x (20).

For Madhva and his followers, it seems that the different gradations, based in the differing capacities of the devotees seeking Narayana, may persist even in the final state of liberation.32 In his rejoinder to the followers of Madhva, implicitly addressed also to Saivas, Desika appeals to scripture: "They have forgotten the passages in the authoritative texts and other texts that speak of highest sameness with the Lord of all."33 Sdyujya - tantamount to perfect sameness - alone is the destination of all beings; it subsumes into its intimacy sdlokya and the other gradations; and there is no reason why it need be delayed over a possibly lengthy series of further lifetimes. It is "with respect to enjoyment" that sameness is possible; Brahman and the liberated person commune with each other in the enjoyment of that bliss. Only in a supreme state of shared bliss is the human destiny completed in accord with true human nature. There is no compromise, no settling for a lesser state or series of lesser states.34 All are called to the same fullness in experience and uninterrupted bliss.35 Desika is also concerned to reject the Samkara non-dualist view of sdyujya, that "sameness" is tantamount to identical non-dualism.36 While in other contexts Desika argues at length against Advaita positions, here in Essence 22 he handles the matter very briefly, primarily by appeal to a key text from the Mahdbhdrata (Sdntiparvan</page><page sequence="16">242 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ 3 13.26-3 1)37: He shares the highest dharmas with the highest, and becomes the same; his dharmas become pure and has the consciousness of that pure, awakened one; his dharmas become liberated, and he becomes the same as the liberated one, Oh bull of Bharata; his self becomes detached, with the dharma of detachment; he is liberated with the liberated; here too, let him be the same; become pure by pure action, his is unlimited light; his self becomes pure, he becomes the same as the pure self; become nothing but self, he becomes the same as that one who is nothing but self; free, he enjoys freedom with the one who is free; all this has been told by me to you, great king, exactly as it is; with a disinterested mind, accept this truth, the eternal dharma, Brahman, pure, primal. Building on his reading of this text, Desika claims that oneness (aikya) and sameness (sdmya) have specific and distinctive meanings and that references to unity imply the accomplishment of a state of very close relationship, but not an essential, metaphysi- cal identity: Since sameness (sdmya) is explicitly stated in authoritative and traditional texts, and in Sutra texts, references to oneness (aikya) in the state of liberation must accordingly be construed without contradicting texts indicative of difference (bheda), such as this one: "Goddess, thus there was born oneness (aikya) between Rama and Sugriva."38 In using this text and making these distinctions, Desika intends a carefully balanced sameness, possible only in a relational context that nonetheless allows for perfect unity of and in experience. Having posited the alternatives of Madhva's permanent differences and Advaita's reduction of sameness to identity, he fashions for himself a middle path. Distinction endures on the metaphysical level; sameness reigns in terms of cooperation, experience, chosen unity. Sameness is a kind of oneness, but it is a union in conscious bliss and excludes what Desika would think of as a reduc- tive, monistic simplification. Sameness in Enjoyment, Difference in Powers The full sameness to which Desika points does not obliterate difference entirely. He explains that the human self does not participate in the work of creation. The self and God share enjoyment, but not power or duties. Desika describes again, as in Essence 3 and 5, the attributes of the Lord and self: there is distinction in the elements of power and action, even if not in essential qualities. In Essence 22, Desika is elaborat- ing distinctions already alluded to by his predecessor Ramanuja. In commenting on</page><page sequence="17">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 243 Brahma Sutras 4.4.17, "Except regarding the work of the world...," Ramanuja introduces an adversarial view to the effect that the soul is entirely equal to the Lord, even in cosmic functioning, a view which appeals to our key guiding text, Mundaka Upanisad3A.3: For, [the adversary] says, an authoritative text indicates that the self reaches same- ness with the highest self; and moreover another authoritative text also ascribes [to the self] the power that all its intentions come true.39 But this sameness and this power to have one's intentions come true are implausible unless the self too controls the world in the same way as the Lord of all. Ramanuja rejects the idea that the individual self shares entirely in divine action, suggesting instead a certain limited participation: The released self, freed from all that obscures, has a lordship in the form of an experience of Brahman without any indirection. This is apart from controlling differences in proper form, continuity, and activity of all beings conscious and non-conscious.... If liberated selves shared this control of the entire world, it would be a common feature, and that form, being Lord of the world, would not be a defining feature of Brahman. Revelatory texts indicate by context that ruling the entire world belongs to the highest person (and not the individual self).40 But at the same time, Ramanuja adds in 4.4.21, "For there are indications only of sameness in enjoyment," that this distinction in powers does not diminish bliss: This supreme Lord, when pleased by the faithful worship of his devotees... frees them from the ignorance which takes the form of the accumulation of karma accumulated over the infinite progress of time and hence hard to overcome; allows them to attain to that unsurpassable bliss which takes the form of experience of himself as he is; and after that does not make them return here. This we learn from the authoritative texts alone.41 For Desika too, the perfect resemblance of the individual self (to Brahman) is only that arising from knowledge, enjoyment, and the like. The Lord has, for His definition, attributes which are emblematic of his identity, like a king's umbrella and fan: cause of the world, bestower of liberation, support for everything, controller of the world, on whom all things depend, He who has everything for His body,</page><page sequence="18">244 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ who is denoted by all words, understood in all the Vedas, refuge of all the world, adored by all desiring liberation, granting the fruits (of all actions), whose essential nature is knowledge and bliss pervading all, the spouse of LaksmI, and so forth. These are peculiar to the Lord and are his distinctive features. By contrast, the liber- ated person's distinctive attributes are the following: being sustained (by the Lord), being controlled by Him, belonging entirely to the Lord, being in extension the size of an atom, and other such attributes.42 Yet it remains true that this real difference in function does not hinder a full same- ness of the Lord and humans, sharing a single bliss, perfectly and fully enjoyed. To show this, Desika draws in yet another of the Brahma Sutras, 4.4.21 : It is true that the liberated person has nothing to do with the work of creating, maintaining, destroying the world, etc. But just as the father who cultivates the field and the sons and others who do not cultivate it enjoy alike the fruits of the farming, the experience of the work of ruling the world belongs equally to the Lord who does it and to the liberated person who sees it. Thus the author of the Sutras, in the sutras from "The liberated person [is the same as the Lord] except regarding the work of the world" [4.4.17] to "For there are indications only of sameness in enjoyment" [4.4.2 1].43 Overall, when Desika argues for his version of paramam samyam against the Advaita and Madhva views, he shares with the Saivas and others the view that there is an ultimate state, unlike any of those preceding it. But against even the Saiva view, he is arguing that "sameness" is a communion in bliss that is shared equally and in the same way by the divine persons and by the various lesser living beings, even if they still differ in terms of power and responsibility. All of this is seen in an eschatological context. Non-return to this world is not a karmic necessity, nor an extrinsic state, but rather is rooted in the final state of the liberated person, in relation to a gracious God; it is oneness in a chosen harmony that is never sated, never ended. The logic of bliss is operative, not the law-and-trans- gression of life on earth. For here, too, the nature of humans and God is asserted, the (inevitable) choice that liberated humans keep making for God.</page><page sequence="19">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 245 Near the chapter's end, Desika makes clear the certain and irreversible endpoint of this shared experience: 'The perfect and full enjoyment of Brahman, which extends into service, the goal that is called liberation, lasts as long as the self exists. For this reason, 'there is no return'."44 The idea of "no return," as indicated in the passage of Tiruvdymoli cited at the beginning of Essence 22, is now clearly rooted in the pleasure of the liberated self, which loves the experience of the Lord and loves the enactment of service. Neither Lord nor individual self can imagine ending the joy that is now shared, equally; in this sense in particular, theirs is an eternal sameness rooted in volition and personal relationship. Poetic Insight Desika ends the chapter with two verses. In Tamil, he indicates the joy of heaven, a joy in continuity with the joy already experienced in intentional communion on earth: Rising to the splendid abode, approaching the Lord who is crowned with fragrant basil and who ever delights in what is good for all beings, obtaining our share in service, ever flourishing at the sounding anklets of the assembly of gurus, enjoying delights unchanging - we abide in joy. The final Sanskrit verse highlights the experience of a mingling that is union-in- pleasure - like honey and milk; in the growing fullness of acts of faith and fidelity, seen, heard, and tasted, there grows the bliss that fully occupies God and self: May it become vivid in my mind: the tumult of hundreds of acts of faith, rising in waves, never exhausted, one upon the other, acts that sages and other perfected beings can accomplish, blending together like honey and milk, great bliss radiating the array of his qualities and glories, floods of the experience of Brahman in every kind.45 In Desika' s system there is surely a growing conformity to the divine person(s); but this is no static, final likeness - rather, it is tumultuous, like a river rising to the flood. The human ultimately rises to a true, superlative sameness with God, but this remains firmly rooted in the distinctions and asymmetries of the divine and human and a firm insistence on the differences between the divine and human manifesta- tions and operations of power. This is ultimately a theology of enjoyment, in which the sameness occurs in the climactic, highest fulfillment of God-and-human in one another, a bliss in which the two become the same as one another, knowing and</page><page sequence="20">246 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ enjoying bliss together. Completing - and Revising - the Comparison My hope has been that this rather narrow focus on Essence 22 and "sameness in enjoyment" according to Vedanta Desika, after our quick survey of wider possi- bilities in the Hindu context for reflection on the imago Dei theme, exemplifies the kind of choice we have to make when fashioning intelligent and productive compari- sons across religious boundaries. Let us now turn back to our comparative project, "returning" to the Christian tradition. Middleton's reading of the Genesis text as indicative of human participation in the work of God directed our attention to the intentional divine-human relation in Hinduism as likewise a construction aimed at an enhanced and intensified resem- blance, "sameness" (sdmya). This sameness, Desika instructs us, is not merely an essential resemblance or identity, but rather a participatory, mutual enjoyment that accelerates into a condition where the divine and human persons share a single divine bliss. Desika founds his vision of ultimate fulfillment and the convergence of divine and human reality in the dynamics of enjoyment, the mutual and equal pleas- ure of God and dependent living beings. Asymmetrical metaphysical relationships are presumed, and divine-human differences remain, but there is a most important sameness that permanently defines the nature and quality of the personal interrela- tionship that is the divine-human relationship. The analogy to the imago Dei, insofar as there is one in this Srlvaisnava tradition, therefore has to do with the conscious, free appropriation of the superlative good of divine-human communion, essentially shared by divine and human persons who become increasingly alike to one another. Being like-God subsists most importantly in this participation; sameness is perma- nent communion in the same goods enjoyed in the same way; it is an ultimate goal, but it is anticipated on earth, in community. While this position is not identical with Middleton's, the idea that conformation occurs in action, service, and intentional relationship marks a similar shift away from the search for a shared resemblance in essence, visible form and a move to the domain of intentionally enacted, experienced, and affirmed relationships. While the political worlds of the ancient Near East and medieval India are far apart, in both cases we observe resistance to hierarchy: in Genesis, being in imago Dei is afforded to all humans and not just the monarch; in the Essence, sameness is afforded to all beings and not in essential gradations that replicate for eternity distinctions carried over from earthly hierarchies. What is at stake here, more fruitfully, is how certain human capacities for service, love, and enjoyment can be maximized in a perfect and enduring fullness that is really what being-in-the-image-of-God is about. In both traditions this identification presumes some remaining difference, most importantly reserving to God action related to the maintenance of the world as a whole. But my reflection on Essence 22 asks more of us than a simple acknowledgment that its theme is somewhat like the theme of Genesis 1 as understood by Middleton.</page><page sequence="21">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 247 In fact it suggests another fruitful comparison, unanticipated if one merely accepts the biblical text as the starting point for a Hindu-Christian comparative inquiry that proceeds only in terms of some given, settled Christian question. If we admit that the roles can be reversed, the Hindu text can instigate a new, different inquiry into Christian materials. Given Desika's view of an ever-deepening relationship of the divine and human actors in mutual sharing and enjoyment, each, as it were, fulfilled in the other, our attention is drawn away from Genesis to another analogue - the understanding of created (human and angelic) vision of the divine essence. In the following paragraphs, while not abandoning our interest in the divine-human rela- tionship, I introduce what I have found to be an alternative line of comparison, regarding the experience that brings God and humans into a similitude that is ulti- mately a divinization process or, as it will be termed below, a "dei-formation" of the human in light of the divine. I do so only by way of a single example, a passage from the foremost Catholic Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas, in his Summa Theologiae.46 In Summa Theologiae 1.12.2, Aquinas addresses the question, "Whether the essence of God is seen by the created intellect through an image."47 He defends the view that the created intellect can see God's essence - not by its own natural powers, but through assimilation to the divine self: Now it is manifest both that God is the author of the intellectual power and that He can be seen by the intellect. And since the intellective power of the creature is not the essence of God, it follows that it is some kind of participated likeness of Him who is the first intellect. Hence also the intellectual power of the creature is called an intelligible light, as it were, derived from the first light, whether this be under- stood of the natural power or of some perfection superadded of grace or of glory. Therefore, in order to see God, there must be some similitude of God on the part of the visual faculty, whereby the intellect is made capable of seeing God. In Summa Theologiae 1.12.5, Aquinas goes on to ask "Whether the created intellect needs any created light in order to see the essence of God." To the objection that created light is not required, he quotes Psalm 35, "In Thy light we shall see light," and argues that the intellect must be informed not with a created light, but with the uncreated light of divine presence, in order to know God: When any created intellect sees the essence of God, the essence of God itself becomes the intelligible form of the intellect. Hence it is necessary that some supernatural disposition should be added to the intellect in order that it may be raised up to such a great and sublime height. Now since the natural power of the created intellect does not avail to enable it to see the essence of God, as was shown in the preceding article, it is necessary that the power of understanding should be added by divine grace. Now this increase of the intellectual powers is called the illumination of the intellect, as we also call the intelligible object itself</page><page sequence="22">248 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ lumen or lux. So, too, this infusion of the divine essence as a kind of life is the event of "dei- formation," a divine re-formation of the soul: "Z?v this light the blessed are made dei-form, that is, like to God, according to the saying: 'When He shall appear we shall be like to Him, and we shall see Him as He is' " (7 John 2:2).48 Dei-formation thus described captures something of the dynamic interplay and finality operative in Desika's treatment of highest sameness. Aquinas's insight, like that of Desika, also stresses the cognitive and interpersonal destiny of persons by grace brought into a oneness with God that is neither a merely visual resemblance nor a genetic commonality, but a freely chosen intimacy that becomes a likeness that endures existentially. While Aquinas's images of knowing and illumination and Desika's images of blissful experience are not the same, both point us to an existential level on which intelligent agents in free choice, at divine initiative, become conformed to one another at their full capacity. Yet differences still matter, and as the comparison is narrowed we find differences that are more rather than less interesting. For example, in Summa Theologiae 1.12.6, Aquinas raises a question analogous to that raised by Desika (with respect to Madhva) regarding gradations in knowledge of God: of those who see the essence of God, does one see more perfectly than another? Whereas Desika insisted that all share fully God's ultimate bliss, here Aquinas's view is closer to that of Madhva: Eternal life consists in the vision of God: 'This is eternal life, that they may know Thee the only true God" (John 17.3) etc. Therefore if all saw the essence of God equally in eternal life, all would be equal, the contrary to which is declared by the Apostle: "Star differs from star in glory" (/ Corinthians 15.41). Of those who see the essence of God, one sees Him more perfectly than another... because one intellect will have a greater power or faculty to see God than another. Even if the vision of God is God's gift, "The faculty of seeing God, however, does not belong to the created intellect naturally, but is given to it by the light of glory, which establishes the intellect in a kind of dei-formity." Nevertheless, there are gradations geared to the deeds and cultivated capacities of the recipient: Hence the intellect which has more of the light of glory will see God the more perfectly; and he will have a fuller participation of the light of glory who has more charity; because where there is the greater charity, there is the more desire; and desire in a certain degree makes the one desiring apt and prepared to receive the object desired. Hence he who possesses the more charity, will see God the more perfectly and will be the more beatified. As we have seen, Desika's interpretation of the final conformity of divine and human demands that all share full vision that is the destiny of all: the fullness of the</page><page sequence="23">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 249 imago, if we may, lies in the fullness of conscious joy, God and humans indistin- guishable in the subjective and objective dimensions of that experience, even if other dimensions of human and divine activity remain distinct. At this point, therefore, not only do we have an interreligious comparison, but also an interreligious dispute of some theological sophistication, in which Aquinas and Madhva may be recognized as allies defending some difference as against Desika's insistence on a more com- plete subjective and objective sameness of God and humans, divine-human distinc- tions notwithstanding. If we believe in the value of theological reflection, then the modest but real value of a comparative theological reflection on imago Dei, such as draws honestly and gratefully on two theological traditions, should now become increasingly evident. In conclusion, I wish to step back from the possibilities I have sketched thus far and return to the general topic of Christian-Hindu comparisons. I hope I have shown in these pages that comparison, undertaken with attention to detail, is a flexible process that does not mean merely that one tradition borrows content from another, for its own benign or odious comparisons. Rather, when we narrow down a range of possibilities to a few candidates for comparison and then focus on just one fruitful option, this learning process may well destabilize the initial comparison by refocus- ing the state of the question. Thus, here, my initial focus on Genesis 1 gave way, by the end of my study, to fresh notice of a text from Aquinas that was, at the start, not part of my consideration at all. Studying sameness in Essence 22 afforded new insights into how God and humans become the same, as it were, and these compelled me to shift my attention to a different comparison altogether: Aquinas' s sense of dei- formation. I must also, finally, confess the confidence underlying this and similar compara- tive projects I have undertaken. My comparative projects rely on an expectation about the realities underlying research that engages both the Christian and Hindu traditions: differences notwithstanding, we are talking, we should be able to talk, about God and humans in relationship, at a level that is not merely tradition-specific but "real." This manner of comparison is ultimately a theological project that has to do with the basic reality of our human existence and destiny, our capacity for divini- zation in an ultimate encounter with God. Given our respective doctrinal heritages, these are issues that can and should be of interest to those Roman Catholic Christians and Srivaisnava Hindus who are willing to learn their own tradition better and differently, through the study of another. I would hope too that such matters will be of interest to a much wider community of religious intellectuals willing to address ultimate questions by the study of particular traditions and with a sufficiently flexi- ble comparative method.

Here and throughout I use Olivelle's translation of the Upanisads, with several</page><page sequence="24">250 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ adaptations as noted. Most importantly, I translate paramam sdmyam (Olivelle's "highest identity") as "highest sameness." See note 12. 3. This essay began as a plenary paper for the American Theological Society Annual Meeting, Princeton, April 5, 2008. Although I have revised it in light of my further reflection on the Hindu texts mentioned and my views on fruitful compari- son, I have kept the basic structure ordered to that original Christian theological audience. 4. McFarland's The Divine Image (2005) further enriches our understanding of the Christian theological appropriation of the imago Dei. Delineating distinctive features of the Christian view of imago, McFarland proposes a clear argument: "I will argue that [the theme of Genesis 1 .27] is significant not because it tells what human being are, but because it indicates the kinds of things they need to do if they would know God" (vii). As in Middleton, therefore, the emphasis is shifted from a search for essential or visible features shared by God and humans, to acting appropriately in response to God, in imitation of Jesus, in community. In the book's final pages, Middleton (2005) summarizes his analysis in a way that likewise diverts attention from essential and visible resemblances to the matter of divine (and then human) action: "God wills for us to live in Jesus and, through Jesus, to become sharers in God's own triune life. It follows that seeing the divine image - and thereby knowing God - is not a matter of trying to isolate certain qualities that Jesus and the rest of humankind have in common. This is certainly not to deny that there are such qualities, or even that they are subject to continual perfecting by the power of the Spirit until that day when 'we will be like [Christ], for we will see him as he is' (/ John 3.2; compare Colossians 3.4). But it is to argue that the image of God is rightly regarded not as something that we have, but rather as something that God does to us by grafting us into the life of Christ" (166). 5.

Still later Srivaisnava theologians confirm what had clearly become a standard belief in the tradition: as devotees seek the Lord, so the Lord makes himself found by them. In the fourteenth century Vedanta Desika, of whom we shall hear more below, connects Mutal Tiruvantati with a text from the Bhagavad Gltd: "The person surrendering to the Lord should meditate on the Lord's making himself dependent on those who seek his protection in a manner that cannot be understood by the mind or described in words. As it says, 'However someone takes refuge in me, in that way do I favor them' (Bhagavad Gltd 4.11); the same is also stated in Tamil, 'Which- ever form pleases his people, that is his form' (Mutal Tiruvantati 44)" (Srimad Rahasyatrayasdra, chapter 15; Ayyangar 1956: 155). U. T. Viraghavacharya (1980, 1 : 470), a modern commentator on Desika, notes that these verses show us how the Lord's determination to be accessible goes well beyond the act of divine descents, accommodating himself to whatever his devotees conjure in their minds. On all this, see Clooney (2002).</page><page sequence="25">A Christian Understanding of imago Dei I 251 8.

We can also notice Srlmad Rahasyatrayasdra 16, wherein God too is linked to the human community, forming a divine-human community of persons entirely dependent on one another. 11. Translations are mine, but readers are also advised to consult Ayyangar' s published translation. References are to Ramadesikacaryar's edition of the original, followed by reference to the Ayyangar translation; thus here, pages 53-54/25-26. 12. "Sameness," though awkward, is a more apt marker for sdmya than the weaker words "similarity," "equality," and "resemblance," and it is preferably to the stronger word "identity," which suggests a denial of difference altogether. Key to the exegetical and theological challenge facing Desika is indeed to construe "sameness" as somewhere between the relational "similarity" and unconditional "identity." 13. The chapter will thus focus on particular persons, who have, while alive, taken the radical step of dependence on the Lord. 14. Ayyangar (1956: 211) notes that these qualities are freedom from sin, old age, death, sorrow, hunger, thirst, the possession of all desired objects, and a will meeting no hindrance. 15.389-390/211. 16. 1 use with significant revisions the translation by George Thibaut in Ramanuja 1966 and have referred to the Sanskrit of the 1989 edition. 17.

Implicitly - since Desika will not quote an Upanisad in the Essence so that, in his orthodox setting, the Essence can remain available to a wider readership not restricted by caste concerns. The commentators, however, do quote the Upanisadic text. 21. My translation. Desika quotes only what appear in translation as the third and fourth lines, but for the sake of context I have given the entire verse; "never" is the key word, as it indicates the permanency of the relationship. The verse as a whole is the word of a concerned mother about her daughter who is smitten with divine love. 22.390/215. 23. There are three sites for bliss: the Lord, Heaven, and the individual self, each, though otherwise possessed of non-identical distinguishing characteristics, con- formed to one another with respect to the completeness and perfection of bliss. This</page><page sequence="26">252 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ is the equation of three referents of "highest place" (paramam padam): the Lord's own self (bhagavat-svarupam), Heaven (vaikuntham), and the individual self (jiva- svarupam). This ordinary human world, too, though seemingly a place of bondage, is also of delight to the individual person. 24. Neither Desika nor his commentators cite specific passages from Ramanuja's Sarandgati Gadya, but passages such as these are probably those he had in mind: "[Upon reaching me,] you will then realise by direct vision that your essential nature consists in being controlled by me and in being solely and exclusively devoted to my service. With the sole and exclusive enjoyment of me, with the sole and exclusive joy of serving me and with the full, continuous, eternal, distinct, infinite and unequalled joy of experiencing me without any other end in view, you shall become my eternal servant finding your sole delight in rendering all forms of service without any exception and appropriate to all states and situations..." (paragraph number 17, page 19); "At the time of the body falling away (from you) and solely as a result of my compassion, you will have a distinct vision of me alone; with perfect knowledge, without deviating from previous discipline and previous longing, you will lightly cast off this material nature both in its gross and in its subtle form like a worn out garment; and you will, at that very moment, become my eternal servant who finds sole and exclusive joy in rendering all forms of service without exception, such as are suited to all states and situations..." (paragraph number 20, page 20); "Enable me to have, Lord, remembrance of You at the last moment which results from service to You" (paragraph number 24, page 20). I use the enumeration found in Iyengar (Ramanuja 2002). 25. 394-95/217-18. There follow technical points regarding the nature of "visits" to the earthly realm and the return to Vaikuntha. 26. Originally, I thought that sdrupya might be the closest analogue to imago Dei; but by tradition sdrupya is a lesser likeness than sdyujya, wherein common under- standing and intent more deeply link Lord and self. See Yoga Sutras 1.3, where sdrupya is used to name the flaw of too close a connection to the objects of knowl- edge. See Maitrl UpanisadAA and 4.4 on the superlative importance of sdyujya. 27. The Srivaisnava commentator Rangaramanuja (1995, 2: 130) glosses sdyujya as samdna-gunayoga, at Brhaddranyaka Upanisad 1.5.23, "in connection with the same quality" and seems to leave both simply in correlation with the final word in the Upanisadic verse, salokata. 28. 1 have used, albeit with adaptations, the translation by Rau (1904: 285). For the Sanskrit I have used Madhvacarya (1981). 29. See the last section of this essay for comment on the similarity of Madhva's view and that of Thomas Aquinas. Theological positions are not necessarily sorted out in accord with religious denominations, and there is no reason why a Hindu and a Christian theologian cannot find themselves on the same side of a theological dispute, facing other Hindu and Christian theologians holding the opposite view. 30.

A related charge is that some - seemingly also those connected with the Madhva school - hold that flawed behavior by those who have already been liber- ated leads to diminishment in bliss. Desika responds, "It is true that there may be delay or no delay in attaining release from bondage, but after release is attained, there is no difference at all in the enjoyment of bliss" (219). See also Srimad Rahasyatrayasdra 18, and Clooney (2009), on the non-possibility of evil after surrender. Between the act of surrender to God and death there are still the effects of intervening causes that hasten or impede early union with the Lord; but after release is achieved, no such impediments exist. 33.397/219. 34. Related to the Madhva position and to the implied Saiva position is a later rejection of the very categories by Gaudlya Vaisnavas. For them, these verses from the Bhdgavata Purdna are key: "Such devotees do not accept, even when offered, any of the five forms of liberation: sdlokya, sdrstya, sdmipya, sdrupya, and sdyujya. The only thing they want is the opportunity to render loving service to Me" (3.29.13) and "Having attained to life's fulfillment through my service, they do not care for the four forms of liberation: sdlokya, sdmipya, sdrupya, and sdyujya, which are theirs by virtue of their service to me" (9.5.67; as translated by Tagare). In accord with his conservative instinct, Desika does not abandon the language of this series of levels of proximate presence, but sees them all as encompassed by sdyujya, which alone is the destiny of all. He implicitly respects the given categories, while yet agreeing with what centuries later would become the Gaudlya Vaisnava view, that the state of bliss one attains is not a matter of accomplishment, achievement. 35. Desika also argues for the synonymy of sdyujya (union) with sdrstya (perhaps, "having the same visionary experience") lest there seem to be something lacking in the human experience of the divine person's perfect bliss; by sdyujya is meant that they share a single object of bliss; by sdrstya, that they share it with the same perfect enjoyment. 36. In fact, by the nature of its synthesis, the Samkara Advaita tradition is less interested in this topic. When the words sdyujya and salokatd appear in the Brhad- dranyaka Upanisad (1.3.22, 1.5.23, 5.13.1-2), the commentator Samkara manifests little interest; similarly, he does not use Uttara Mimdmsd Sutra 4.4.21, where Brhad- dranyaka Upanisad 1.5.23 is cited, to develop a theory of the nature or gradations of sdmya; rather, he affirms the sutra itself, that there is sameness in enjoyment (bhoga-sdmya). 37. 402-403/223. 38. Rdmdyana 5.35.51; 403-404/223. The point is that their oneness could not be "born," come into existence, unless earlier there had been some difference. 39. Ramanuja cites two texts here. 40. Thibaut, 766-77; Sanskrit, 650. 41. Thibaut, 770; Sanskrit, 653. 42. 405/224. 43. 400/221. Desika also cites the grammarian Sakatayana in highlighting the cen-</page><page sequence="28">254 / Francis X. Clooney, SJ tral point that there is a shared rasa, spiritual taste/experience: "Those expert regard- ing Brahman explain that sdyujya is 'having the same experience' (sdmarasyam)." 44. 407/226. The last citation, alluding to the Chdndogya Upanisad 8.15, also indicates Brahma Sutra A All. 45. 407-408/226. 46. Other fruitful starting points may be found in Summa Theologiae 3.92, on the nature of the beatific vision, and in 1 .93, where the very topic of the imago Dei is addressed. 47. In the following paragraphs I have used the 1948 translation, with my emphases. 48. In reply to Objection 3, Aquinas reaffirms this ^/-formation: "The disposition to the form of fire can be natural only to the subject of that form. Hence the light of glory cannot be natural to a creature unless the creature has a divine nature; which is impossible. But by this light the rational creature is made dei-foxm, as is said in this article." References Cited Aquinas, Thomas. 1948. Summa Theologiae (trans. Dominican Fathers of the English Province).
