<plain_text><page sequence="1">49 THE CONCEPT OF THE MULATTO IN SOME WORKS OF DEREK WALCOTT Introduction "It is no easy fate to be a West Indian of sensibility and live in the Caribbean today"1 and Derek Walcott, a mulatto, is perhaps the most sensitive and conflict- ridden Caribbean artist who makes creative use of his schizophrenia to touch the sensibilities of his people. An examination of his play Dream on Monkey Mountain will serve as a basic reference and the most significant point of departure for a meaningful discussion of the concept of the mulatto. For it is clearly a mulatto play where all the conflicts, fears, anxieties and aspirations of the mulatto are externalised and presented in compressed metaphor. In Dream on Monkey Mountain, Walcott explores the displaced searching psyche of modern man groping for a truth: and more specifically, the mulatto searching for his roots and his sense of identity and purpose in life. "It is a journey from man back to ape" which everyone "should make ... to articulate his origins."2 'The darkness which yawns before him is terrifying . . . but for those who have been called not men but mimics, the darkness must be total."3 In Dream on Monkey Mountain, Walcott uses "all the subconscious and deliberate borrowings of poetry"4 in a "complex but steady trance of progress towards a truth" which involves "charting the subconscious, taking the temperature of the senses and any number of indefined feelings, hesitations and memories all disciplined by the logic of the imagination."5 He makes valid use of the ambiguous nature of a dream to depict the contradictory impulses that lie deep in the unconscious and often tend only to surface in our dreams. His symbols are like simultaneous presentations of the paradoxical flash of an instant in which every facet was caught in a crystal of ambiguities.6 The deliberate technique of the dream as representative of the unconscious is therefore a particularly ingenious and dramatic device to explore and lay bare the angst-ridden sensibilities of the mulatto. It allows for the obtrusion of unconscious or suppressed urges: love/hate impulses, and all other attitudes that have been shaped or distorted by isolation or the memory of ancient grievances: childhood fantasies as well as mature instincts. Images of "abuse by Bible and by sword." In short, all the mulatto sensibilities that have "soaked too long in the basin of the mind"7 Like leaves like dim seas in the mind; Or as a sunken sea-cave, carved, in sand.8</page><page sequence="2">50 My aim in this study, is to work from the initial symbol of 'the dream', referring to other works such as Wine of the Country, What The Twilight Says: An Overture, Muse of History, Another Life, and some of Walcott's earlier poetry to show continui- ties with, or movements away from, the concept of the mulatto in his earlier works. The truth of human existence/experience is the theme of Dream on Monkey Mountain - a truth that has to be apprehended in its totality rather than defined. The Mulatto Sensibility Derek Walcott, like the moderns who have come under the spell of Eliot, has tried to abstract the essences of the past, and to give us a classicism distilled through ages of history "to record the anguish of race"9 pointing to possibilities for the future when "niggers everywhere could walk upright like men".10 For some of the apes had straighten their backbone, and start walking upright, but there was one tribe unfortunately that lingered behind, and that was the nigger.11 This statement is significantly made by Lestrade, the mulatto who at this point, rejects his negritude and dissociates himself from the 'niggers': "If you apes will behave like gentlemen, who knows what may happen . . . '5l 2 Walcott suggests that "In the subconscious, there is a black Atlantis buried in a sea of sand",13 and that if the blacks, and by extension, the mulattos, are to attain self- knowledge and discover "the beautiful depth of their blackness"14 and become con- scious of the "roots of delight growing downward",15 it is essential to cross the dark- ness and "descend/Down to the desolation of self".16 It is the "straining after the old truth"17 and a creative use of schizophrenia whereby the conflict and duality of the mulatto, by their very compulsion, will serve as an impetus to the propulsive forces that generate positive, creative affirmations of being and of identity. Derek Walcott has exploded the "myth of the uncreative, parasitic, malarial nigger"18 - "the black fawning verger" - whom he felt "needed to be stirred into bitterness, thence perhaps into action" for "action was better than nothing, better than that embittered affection with which each called the other nigger"19 because "out of it, with patience, new reverberations would come."20 It is indeed the universal "straining after the old truth" - the descent into "the desolation of reality"21 - the inner subjective self - the noumenon, to which Yeats referred in his poetry. The play therefore, thrusts us inward toward psychological complexity and outward toward symbolism - Walcott uses richly complex symbols that take on shifting implications within the play as an index to the duality of any given experience - the duality of our being. It is necessary for those who read Walcott to recognise at the outset the duality of his being, and if he is to progress in his understanding of Walcott's works, he must take an intelligent position between contraries, since conflict and dividedness are at the heart of this "mulatto of style." Without conflict there can be no progress and as Yeats had asserted "Between extremities/ Man runs his course"22 and intimated that all effort is futile except our</page><page sequence="3">51 confrontation with futility. It is out of the tension of opposites that Walcott achieves a true balance with his own hybrid vigour. One of the main characteristics of Dream on Monkey Mountain is that the irony should be expressed through metaphor and that the meaning of an ironic expression can be appreciated only in relation to other expressions that are clearly symbolic. The central design of the play is composed of a group of symbolic metaphors and his irony is inherent in the meaning of his symbols. By interpreting them and seeing how they unify the experience of the play and how they externalise the mulatto angst, we can also understand the peculiar character of Walcott 's irony. The very title of the play is ironic. A mountain implies ascent and upward progress which is equated with the laborious communal ascent of the blacks towards the summit of consciousness of their own being and yet the deliberate juxtaposition of the word 'monkey' is a ridicule of that ascent. This is a subtle and double use of irony: The protagonist of the play is Makak. ('Macaque' means 'monkey' in French). Makak is also a primordial creature. 'Ape' or 'monkey man' is one of the most crude and hurtful epithets thrust at black men by white racists or their mimics. Yet Walcott implies that in this image lies salvation. Apehood is a revolutionary stage to which we must regress in order to escape the blind alley of mimicry, in order to capture the true vision of elemental man in his anthropomorphic stages. "In the beginning was the ape, and the ape had no name, so God call him man"23 (not black, not white, but man). My emphasis is used to emphasise the fact that in this statement Walcott makes no racial distinctions but creates a universal situation. Every great work operates on multiple levels of meaning and suasion and this dream unfolds within a larger archetypal frame of reference. Set against the evanescence of all things are the suggestions of infinity they contain. Walcott is as deliberately ambiguous in the specific use of his title as he is in the use of his symbols throughout the play, the total design of which moves toward no clear resolution. The subtlety of the un- answered questions, the deliberate riddles he poses and the unresolved issues raised, are endemic to his creative genius. Although they tend to point to the total uncertain- ty that dominates the future of man, they are also suggestive of the possibilities and the existential choices that face him, and always "the cure is in [himself] ,"24 In every instance the meaning of a symbol always implies its opposite, an ambi- valence finely suggested by the very first statement at the beginning of the play: The play is a dream, one that exists as much in the given mind of its principal characters as in that of its writer, and as such, it is illogical, derivative, contra- dictory. Its source is metaphor and it is best treated as a physical poem with all the subconscious and deliberate-borrowings of poetry.25 The development that is taking place within the play is one which has been germinating and maturing throughout his earlier works. Young Walcott who describes himself as a "prodigy of the wrong age and colour" was obviously groping towards something in his earlier years which could not be defined except within a deepening cycle of exploration and expiation:</page><page sequence="4">52 I weep for hearts like mine continually driven as these lost leaves across earth's barren ground.26 Walcott moves boldly from the simple definitions of areas of conflict to explore the psychological depths of human experience and of transcendental awareness. A style which necessitates the submersion of the self into the greater transcendent reality. There are three distinct phases in Walcott 's difficult maturation that issue in self-knowledge. The Twilight, "through tortuous thickets of Darkness", to the Dawn which illuminates "with vision the mind of primeval peoples".27 'These things are not written without their pain, for their heroes still suffer the abrasions of that life."28 Walcott thrives on ambiguity and ambivalence, and the twilight is as ambiguous as his other symbols. There are three recognisable phases of twilight: the colonial twilight, the creative twilight, and the twilight that "transmutes despair into virtue."29 (a) The Colonial twilight Beminger, the "mongrel mulatto" in Wine of the Country, is described as "a phenomenon cast up on the beach/By the ebb of monarchy, in a colonial twilight."30 You have no hopes, you are a twilit soul caught in a dimness between black and white.3 1 This perception by Margaret, of Beminger's state of mind, confirms the anguish he experiences of belonging neither to the white race nor to the black race. His earlier outburst to Mrs Vertlieu, a white woman, betrays his angst-ridden mulatto sensibili- ties: Spurned and booted between two cultures and two tongues Between desire and despair, between death and hope My people mock me as I am not black Your people mock me as I am not white And yet I am divisible to both What has my skin To do with my desire:32 And as Tigre says later of Lestrade, the mulatto is neither one thing nor the next, neither milk, coal, neither day nor night neither lion nor monkey, but a mulatto, a foot-licking servant of marble law.33 Lestrade accuses the blacks of their "rage for whiteness which does drive niggers mad",34 but like Beminger, his very mind is a "colony, an island outpost of the hypocritical white."35 Walcott must have written of this 'rage for whiteness' fully conscious of ". . . the duality of time, past and present piercingly fixed as if his child- hood were now frighteningly alive."36 As a child, Derek Walcott himself could not understand the reasons for his rejection. He recalls having looked from his window at other children playing, and wished that</page><page sequence="5">53 he could have joined them in their games. But he was obviously not the "right colour". He was neither black nor white, but as he described himself in his poem: "Blues" - he was a "yellow nigger".37 Small wonder then, as he confessed in his recent autobio- graphy under a section significantly entitled 'The Divided Child", "he had prayed/ nightly for his flesh to change/his dun flesh peeled white."38 He was, he felt, "a prodigy of the wrong age and colour"39 and was of "a generation" that "yearned for whiteness".40 It is in this particular phase of the colonial twilight, that the mulatto seems to experience this 'rage for whiteness'. It has often seemed to be a characteristic of the mulatto to try to "identify" with the white race which had always been, during colonial times, the dominant and seem- ingly more progressive race. But the emergence of the New World Negro in all fields of endeavour, in industry as well as the arts, has given him a new sense of his worth and has helped resolve the conflict. "Black faces/white masks" is a recurring image that points to the dimness between black and white - another area of colonial twi- light where the mulatto will remain transfixed in the shadow of the white man's mind if he refuses to progress to the area of darkness. Makak had admitted: "We are . . . ourselves shadows in the firelight of the white man's mind".41 Nicolas Guillen, a Cuban mulatto poet, hinted at the menacing quality of shadows lurking in the mind, in his poem: "Ballad of the Two Grandfathers" and of the necess- ity to grapple with these shadows: Shadows which only I see I'm watched by my two grandfathers, Africa's humid jungles with thick and muted gongs "I'm dying!" (My black grandfather says). Waters dark with alligators, mornings green with coconuts . . . I'm tired! (My white grandfather says). Shadows which only I see, I'm watched by my two grandfathers. They raise their sturdy heads; both of equal size, a Black longing, White longing, both of equal size.42 In an interview with this writer,43 he explained that he was referring to the dual heritage of the Cuban mulatto: the twin cultures of Spain and Africa, both intimating separately, his grandfathers' roots. The mulatto's self-discovery and resolution of the dichotomy born of a dual heritage, would involve a merging of the two cultures,</page><page sequence="6">54 which by implication, would result in a positive affirmation of negritude in the merg- ing of the two shadows, "both" (significantly) "of equal size." The mulattos preoccupation with the image of the grandfather is significant. As the initiator of the cross-breeding, the latter is usually singled out for scrutiny as the focal point of interest in any attempt of the mulatto to grapple with problems of identity, of roots, of a sense of belonging - a sense of 'home'. If we examine Derek Walcott's poem "The Train", we notice a slightly different connotation, compared Guillen's grandfathers (both of equal size - both of equal stature). Walcott's "randy white grandsire" hints of the mental and physical rape of a people by the white colonials. Where was my randy white grandsire from? He left here a century ago to found his 'farm', and, like a thousand others, drunkenly seed their archipelago. Through dirty glass his landscape fills my face. Black with despair he set his flesh on fire, blackening, a tree of flame. That's hell enough for here. His blood burns through me as this engine races, my skin sears like a hairshirt with his name. Like you, grandfather, I cannot change places, I am half-home,44 This concept of loveless breeding, of "drunkenly seeding the archipelago" on a form (a place for animals) is again reflected in Walcott's play Wine of the Country, where Beminger, the mulatto is described by Williams (a negro), as a "Black Englishman" a "freckled spaniel ... a weakling" who was "begotten in a sad industry of loveless breeding."45 And Beminger states that he is the "shadow of an English gentleman."46 (b) The Creative Twilight/The Creative Impulse: 'The sun would never set until its twilight became a metaphor for the withdrawal of Empire and the beginning of our doubt."47 The parallel established here between the doubting and thinking process is reminis- cent of the existentialists who assert that the creative impulse is born of doubt and uncertainty. Perhaps man exists by aping himself - by creating himself as he goes along: more specifically by creating his own existential choices. A Spanish philosopher Unamuno, had written a novel called Niebla48 which means 'cloud' or 'mist' and which is essentially a rejection of Cartesian thought: Descartes' famous dictum "Cogito ergo sum" - "I think, therefore I am" was a reduction of life to the level of idea or mere rationalism. Unamuno gave this expression an ironic twist and his</page><page sequence="7">55 predilection for a new credo: "Dudo, ergo sum" - "I doubt, therefore I am"reflect$ the choices of the creative procedure endemic to the thinking, doubt-initiated process. Unamuno's doubt is not a mental abstraction but the passionate self-questioning of agonised creatures struggling in the living contradiction of a life that is a constant approach to death, Have mercy on these furious lost Whose life is praising life in death49 of reason that must battle reason in order that the quality of life survive Ablaze with rage, I thought Some slave is rotting in this manorial lake50 There is evidence in Walcott's works, of an intermittent or sporadic resurgence ofthat old anger at the leprosy of Empire' but his rage is always tempered by his compassion And still the coal of my compassion fought: That Albion too, was once A colony like ours, All in compassion ends So differently from what the heart arranged:5 1 A recognition of the "vain expense of bitter faction" elicits from Walcott, an admit- tance which betrays an anguish that lies in his very resignation to a fate conditioned by grief: Our lives are mapless, until grief makes us feel A need to simplify and to forgive;52 It is above all, a creative doubt, for without it, there can be no really positive belief, life is not a rational formula, it is a living paradox. ... in the struggle and wrestling of my mind to find out who I was, I was discovering the art of bitterness . . . like Stephen53 ... I was a knot of paradoxes ... I was thus in boyhood, estranged not only from another God, but from the common life of the island . . ,54 The Paradox is the only expression adequate to the fundamental contradiction of existence for it lies beyond reason. It destroys irremediably those neat divisions of reality into mutually exclusive categories which are devitalised schématisations of pure reason. When rationalism is overcome, the lines of demarcation between the spheres of existence disappear and all becomes a mingling of indistinguishable elements, an indecipherable confusion, a mist. I will tell you my dream. Sirs, make a white mist In the mind; make that mist hang like cloth From the dress of a woman, on prickles, on branches, Make it rise from the earth, like the breath of the dead On resurrection morning, and I walking through it On my way to the charcoal pit on the mountain. Make the web of the spider heavy with diamonds</page><page sequence="8">56 And when my hand brush it, let the chain break. And this old man, walking, ugly as sin, In a confusion of vapour, Till I feel I was God self, walking through cloud. In the heaven of my mind. Then I hear this song. Not the whistling of parrots And the bandage of fog unpeeling my eyes, And my feet grow roots,55 It is in this doubting process, "in a confusion of vapour" that Makak paradoxically o7 arrives at self-knowledge - a sense of rootedness. The "web of the spider" and the "mist" (niebla) can be creative forces that "let the chain break" (the chain of mental and physical enslavement) thus shaking off the "leprosy of Empire". The spider also ambiguously represents the spider of prejudice. The mist confuses as well as it enlight- ens. It hints of a sense of mystery and an awe of the numinous that pervade Makak's dream. The resurrection morning reflects so much more hope, and a creative, affirmative belief than the anguished hopelessness echoed in an earlier poem: . . . some grill of light clanged shut on us in bondage, and withheld us from that world below us and beyond, and in its swaddling cerements we're still bound.56 It is significant that the song he hears is not the whistling of parrots to which Walcott referred in an earlier work with regard to colonialism and slavery: Since we small they have us singing like parrot-fish trap with bait5 ' This is Walcott's subtle indication that the black man will continue to ape and imitate the white man mindlessly, like a parrot, until like Makak, he discovers and creates his own identity. The fact that the 'mist' is deliberately ambiguous in the sense that it can illuminate as well as confound and confuse, points to the need for a creative act of affirmation. That is the principal significance of the title Niebla, which itself represents an intentional jumbling of 'opposites'. "Indefinir" and "confundir" - that is to say, to confuse, to jumble and confound the rationalist. To live an authentic existence is not to flee from the problem of life, (as Walcott recognised even in his early years - "So I ... should no more ask/For the safe twilight"5*), but to accept the conflict of opposites, as the basis of our personality. Within the same person, it is the tension of opposites that provides the dynamic life that is denied to those who reduce life to the level of idea and objects, or those who would opt for the false security of "The Harbour" and "the night, urger of old lies".59 Those who would ask for the "safe twilight" rather than "progress outward/ On a sea which is crueller than any word. . ./Braving new water in an antique hoax."60 Or those who would avoid the grace "that gives us vision"6 1 "Create thyself, in order</page><page sequence="9">57 to know thyself." It is only when the negro, and more specifically the mulatto, divests himself of all "malarial enervation" and begins to create himself by knowing himself, will he be able to shake off the "leprosy of Empire." Augusto, the protagonist of Unamuno's novel Niebla is a direct descendant of Segismundo in Calderon's Life Is A Dream,62 who almost three hundred years before had fluctuated between belief and doubt in his existence. "What is the real world," asks Augusto, "but the dream that we all dream, the common dream?63 In Makak's dream kingdom in Africa, in the scene of the apotheosis, where the black race seems to be vindicated, Makak is noticeably trapped in continuing anguish and uncertainty. After all, "Makak lives where he has always lived - in the dream of his people."64 Is our upward ascent a mere dream after all? The higher we climb, the more confused we may become, or conversely, the wiser. The irony of the title: Dream On Monkey Mountain is substantively borne out in all the symbols throughout the play, and the mist can be as confounding as it can be enlightening. And vision can be equally exact- ing in its penalties as it' can be ennobling in its graces. The technique of the dream, of illusion versus reality is deliberate. By ignoring the conventional search for an unequivocal idea or answer to an issue, Walcott allows him- self and the audience, to entertain antithetical or even paradoxical statements in which multiple elements are recognisable. Derek Walcott therefore by recognisable elements in the play, creates himself by externalising his conflict in his works, through his characters, who are the realisations of different aspects or facets of his own mulatto personality. The psychic unease we detect in so many of his lines, betrays an embarassed self-consciousness that "prickles in [him]" "mongrel"65 that he is. Lestrade, the mulatto in Dream On Monkey Mountain manifests so clearly the desires, the anguish, the despair and the psychological needs that had been echoed in earlier works. Walcott's preoccupation with the condition of the mulatto recurs again and again in both his poetry and his plays. His entire collection The Gulf is concerned mainly with the dichotomy: his personal dichotomy as much as the gulf between civilisations, peoples and states of mind, particularly the gulf between black and white, within whose dim twilight the mulatto seemed trapped. ("Some grill of light/Clanged shut on us in bondage"66) Even when the concept of the Mulatto is not the main theme of a work, he interpolates some very revealing statement on their condition or their attitudes to people, or of people's attitudes towards them, in almost every major work. In Malcochon for instance, one character (the Husband) refers to "Augustin, the shabin. The red nigger that think he is a white man."67 This phrase is significantly repeated in Dream On Monkey Mountain, in a description of Lestrade, who before his 'conversion', had conceived of himself as a white man. He was a corporal, "an officer of British rule" and insistently asserted that he had the "white man's law" to uphold. With a typical colonial attitude, he took perverse pleasure in restricting and penalising the 'natives': "There's nothing quite so exciting as putting down the natives!"68 ("the abuse of of ignorance by Bible and by sword"). Lestrade is an interesting and intriguing personification of the dichotomy that had plagued Walcott all his life: "I am a kind of split writer. I have one tradition inside me going one way and another tradition going another."69 Walcott realised that he was</page><page sequence="10">58 the heir of a peculiar legacy - a dual heritage and it was never easy for him, a very sensitive Caribbean man, to reconcile the two: I who am poisoned with the blood of both Where shall I turn, divided to the vein? I who have cursed The drunken officer of British rule, how choose Between this Africa and the English tongue I love? Betray them both, or give back what they give? How can I face such slaughter and be cool? How can I turn from Africa and live?70 These words for which he has been so highly criticised, reflect the great dichotomy, the split in most West Indian writers between Africa and Europe. It is a problem that he grapples and wrestles with, in an intricate and complex manner in Dream On Monkey Mountain and manages to achieve an equilibrium still very rare in West Indian writing. "The focused dilemma is real" says Bill Carr, and Walcott has "the integrity, not merely to put it, but to feel it, to make an art out of it."71 It is "that wrestling contradiction of being white in mind and black in body."72 The recurrent image of "black faces/white masks" underscores the imitation of the white man by the blacks for a mask is used when a desired image is being projected. This constant imitation of the whites had once made him "look on with hopelessness and rage at their new apish habits"73 but Walcott's rage had always been paradoxically "tempered in violence." . . . the- older and more assured I grew, the stronger my isolation as a poet, the more I needed to become omnivorous about the art and literature of Europe to under- stand my own world.74 Walcott deliberately used a charcoal burner as the hero of Dream On Monkey Mountain. He was a "type essential to our own mythology."75 "To me, this figure represented the most isolated, most reduced, race-containing symbol. In addition, I have my own associations of our forests, of rain, of mists, plus of course, the inherent violence or despair in a person of that type - the mad woodcutter."76 Makak is described by Lestrade as a "being without a mind, a will, a name, a tribe of its own",77 and is one whose very dream does not distinguish God as black or white. This is significant because it is he who will be the "healer of leprosy" and the "saviour of his race". Moustique's reference to the "crack coal pot [he] call [his] head"78 is indeed the repository of compassion. As Walcott stated in "Steersman, My Brother", "what gives some hope to the worst human cause" is "The final coal of human tenderness"79 'Twilight transmutes Despair into Virtue': (c) "On heights where the charcoal burners heap their days,"80 ". . . the noblest are those who have accepted the twilight"81 This phase of twilight that "transmutes</page><page sequence="11">59 despair into virtue"82 is an integral part of the creative impulse and leads directly to "the mind's dark cave". . . ,83 Walcott suggests that with patience it can alchemise our lives . . . The Darkness Only the gift To see things as they are, halved by a darkness From which they cannot shift. 84 Darkness assumes ambiguous meanings as in all of the symbols in Walcott's Dream On Monkey Mountain. The most obvious meaning of darkness is black as opposed to white, darkness as equated with evil versus good; it refers to the dark history of slavery: And I, with a black Heart, and my back Healing from history, Bearing time's bitter legends85 In a universal sense, darkness refers to the origins of man - "the dark past from whence we came".86 Darkness can also mean that which is unknown or unexplored, and on a psychological level, the concept of darkness, as in Conrad's Heart of Darkness, refers to the dark unconscious (related to Jung's theory of the unconscious). In the inner recesses of the mind of every man, below the level of consciousness, on a dark unconscious level, lie the inner truth and reality of the self. To attain to some knowledge and understanding of the essence of our being, our inner reality, it is necessary to delve below the conscious level and contend with the darkness of the unconscious in an act of self-discovery. The fact that this area of darkness exists below the level of consciousness, implies the numerous difficulties and dangerous risks involv- ed in the actual descent into the unconscious. It is an essentially isolating and alienat- ing experience since the descent must be made alone, but self-knowledge is impossible without this descent into the unconscious. As one writer, in referring to the artist, says the creative use he makes of his potential will depend very much on the risks that he is willing to take with his psyche. Walcott recognised that this journey into the unknown, into the darkness, is not an easy one and that it can be terrifying The darkness which yawns before them is terrifying. It is the journey back from man to ape. Every actor should make this journey to articulate his origins, but for those who have been called not men but mimics, the darkness must be total, and the cave should not contain a single man-made, mnemonic object. Its noises should be elemental, the roar of rain,</page><page sequence="12">60 ocean, wind, and fire. Their first sound should be like the last, the cry. The voice must grovel in search of itself, until gesture and sound fuse and the blaze of their flesh astonishes them.87 The fact that the "black Atlantis" is buried in a sea of sand implies that the search for self will be a difficult one. The sea is the archetypal symbol of the unconscious, and the black, and more specifically, the mulatto may have to delve very deep into the unconscious. The sand denotes confusion and chaos, so that he will have to sift all the "silt that clogs the river's skirt"88 until he arrives at the level where the "river flows, obliterating Hurt."89 As Walcott indicated, it is "that whole history thing that we have to go through again ... We have to purge ourselves of that whole night- mare."90 Walcott insists that it is necessary for the blacks and especially the mulattos - "those who have been called not men but mimics" - to delve into the unconscious to discover their true identity and attain an affirmation of their being; to perceive in pro- per perspective, the "black Atlantis" buried there. It is in the forest, in the heart of darkness, that Lestrade experiences a kind of con- version, when he is confronted by death in the appearance of Basil, the figure of death. Then and only then, does the mulatto acknowledge his negritude, which he had hitherto rejected: Too late have I loved thee, Africa of my mind, sero te amavi, to cite Saint Augustine who they say was black. I jeered these because I hated half of myself, my eclipse. But now in the heart of the forest at the foot of Monkey Mountain. I kiss your foot O Monkey Mountain. . .91 It is only in this moment of truth that Lestrade is compelled to work out his problems of race and identity and grapple with all the dark contradictory impulses that had plagued him before - his acute awareness that in "some places the law does not allow you to be black, not even black, but tinged with black."92 All the racial and psycho- logical problems and conflicts that as Tigre told him earlier, had been "eating out [his] soul"93 and which had made him punish Makak, because in so doing, he was punish- ing his own grandfather (the root cause of the racial disintegration). In this moment of truth and confrontation with reality, all his guilt-ridden and hitherto suppressed emo- tions now surface with the equally brutal force with which he had meted out the "justice" of the white man, and are compounded with his deep love/hate impulses ("I jeered thee because I hated half of myself). In a superb visual and dramatic presentation in the play, they seem to writhe at him in the agony of an impotent despair. The mulatto angst is here presented in compressed metaphor with the hybrid vigour of the conflict-ridden mulatto, Derek Walcott. He had himself felt like an outsider, an alien outside his skin. He too had that rage for whiteness once. Now through Lestrade, he wrestles psychologically with the contradiction of being "white in mind and black in body."94</page><page sequence="13">61 Naked, stripped physically and psychologically, Lestrade gropes toward self- awareness until his "feet grip like roots".95 - "I have become what I mocked. I always was, I always was. Makak! Makak! forgive me, old father."96 The physical stripping is the necessary casting off of the borrowed robes of the white man and his law - "the withdrawal of Empire". By stripping himself psycho- logically, he finds himself. He attains selfhood in this crucial confrontation with reality in an act of self-discovery that was only possible after he had grappled with the dark forces in the unconscious depths of his mind. . . . now I am myself, Now I feel better. Now I see a new light. I sing the glories of Makak! The glories of my race .... Come all you splendours of imagination. Let me sing of darkness now!97 "Once we have lost our wish to be white, we develop a longing to become black, and these two may be different, but are still careers."98 Lestrade moves from one extreme to the other - almost "one death to another." His previous hatred of the blacks is now replaced by a hatred of the whites, because his act of self-discovery is still not complete. In the scene of the apotheosis, it is he who insists that it is necessary for Makak to kill the white goddess, who is "the confounder of blackness." Makak is the psychological projection of Lestrade's needs, and it is Lestrade who still needs to "discover the beautiful depth of his blackness." The sands of confusion have not yet settled in his mind so that he still cannot discern black and white in their true per- spective. He tells Makak: "She is the white light that paralysed your mind." But having himself wielded the sword of the white man, it would appear that Lestrade, in a reversal of roles, would "chop off her head" in a physical act of psychological self-assertion. Such an act would savour of the "cancelling out of the white blood with the black blood"99 so he compels Makak (whom he has now acknowledged as his black father) to the murderous deed which he himself cannot summon up the courage to perform. Makak who is the embodiment of a more instinctive, more primitive, less rational being, could be the projection of Lestrade's black self - his black alter ego; so that goaded on by Lestrade, he commits the act and kills the white goddess. Walcott deliberately refrains from making any statement as to whether this is a good or an evil act, but only implies, that it was necessary. In the unconscious mind of each of us slumbers infinite capacities for good and evil - "the old original curse" .... Africa as an Experience of the Mind: ". . . . What survives in the slave is nostalgia for imperial modes, Europe or Africa"100 One cannot discuss the concept of the mulatto without mentioning the question of the African experience. In the straining after the old truth, in the quest for identity, it has seemed natural for the mulatto to look to Africa for his origins, his</page><page sequence="14">62 roots and traditional values. Young Walcott had himself undergone this phase: . . . how choose Between this Africa and the English tongue I love? Betray them both, or give back what they give? How can I turn from Africa and live?101 But the mature Walcott is able to place both Africa and Europe in their proper per- spectives. By the time he has come to Dream On Monkey Mountain, Africa is clearly for him, an experience of the mind. For as he said, "I would no longer wish to visit Europe as if I could repossess it, than I wish to visit Africa for that purpose."102 In Dream On Monkey Mountain, Moustique had said to Makak: Look, turn your head, old man, look there, and that thing shining there that is the ocean. Behind that, is Africa!103 Africa behind the ocean is significant, because as Moustique points out to Makak, to get to Africa, it is essential to cross the ocean. On a psychological level, the sea as the archetypal symbol of the unconscious lies between the mulatto and Africa. To perceive of Africa qua Africa, the descent into the unconscious is necessary, whereby the concept of Africa becomes not so much the physical transference of a set of people to a specific geographic region, as it is a psychological experience - an area of darkness that allows for a meaningful conception and re-shaping of values. In a recent interview, Walcott was very explicit about this message: The ultimate message in Dream On Monkey Mountain is for us to shed the African longing, and to say that we are here, whatever the historical process that brought us, and this is where our roots have to begin; and with that whole cycle of reclaiming the territory, spiritual territory, where we have been put. The whole cycle of Makak's experience is that he makes the journey (to Africa) but when he returns, the idea is that he repossesses, or for the first time, has a feeling of possess- ing where he belongs - where he h^s been found.104 Walcott has come to realise that hankering after Europe or Africa cannot be a very valid or enlightening exercise. "The intensity of defining what is black or what is African or so on becomes a very silly game after a while The profounder things are what cannot be changed and that's where the values are."105 The Dawn Walcott points to a way to voyage beyond Africa or Europe to new dimensions of consciousness, perceptible only to those who have accepted the twilight, in a creative act of affirmation. This is a vision of the new consciousness of which those "twilight intellects on the edge of light" are dimly aware, but could never achieve without</page><page sequence="15">63 crossing the darkness over the brink - "The gulf, your gulf [was] daily widening"106 to the dawn of a new consciousness. The imagery in Dream On Monkey Mountain hints of a return to a kind of Eden. An ascent to the mountain, followed by the descent into the darkness and the forest and a return to 'the green beginnings of this world . . ." There is a type of 'tropical reincarnation' - "I return to this earth, my mother."107 - a sense of 'at-one-ness' in the womb of nature which provides an all-encompassing frame of reference extend- ing far beyond all human limitations. Walcott gives sensuous reality to a number of ideas we can infer from the work. That co-existing with, and possibly outside of Time, and greater than human consciousness, is an 'unruined consciousness' of which we have unexpected, seemingly supernatural intimations: that these intimations take the form of parallels, correspondences, continuities, premonitions and intuitions. And that, paradoxically, it is possible to become conscious of these precarious establish- ments of unruined consciousness, which can alchemize our lives, even out of the ruins of history and civilizations. The ability to focus black and white in essential relationship and to perceive of the good and evil in both, an awareness of the racial complexity and cultural diversity of different civilizations, is a far greater gift and vision than either the children of black- ness or the children of whiteness could claim as their own separate inheritance. "Maturity is the assimilation of the features of every ancestor."108 This perception makes Walcott's mature works and especially Dream On Monkey Mountain, not a mere racial probing or search for an identity, but also a subdued testimony to know the worst and remain loving. To see "the decaying stem of the rose and to smell the manure that makes the oleander bloom."109 To be acutely aware of the stench of rotting limes ("the leprosy of Empire"), even as it quickens in the nostrils while giving cognizance to the fact that "Albion too was once a colony like ours, 'Part of the continent, piece of the main' '5l 1 ° I feel absolutely no shame in having endured the colonial experience. There was no obvious humilia- tion in it. In fact I think that many of what are sneered at as colonial values are part of the strength of the West Indian psyche, a fusion of formalism with exuberance.111 With maturity, Walcott has a better understanding that the bonds that bind us are greater than the shibboleths that separate us. Of colonialism, he confesses that it was "cruel, but it created our literature."1 12 Out of such savage, tangled roots, was born This monolithic, unforgiving face Wrought in a furious kiln, in which each race Expects its hundredth dawn.1 13 His sense of outrage has been refined in the "furious kiln" of experience, and the coal of his compassion has triumphed over threatened extinction by the "white rain." Men of diametrically challenging backgrounds, racial</page><page sequence="16">64 opposites . . . balance on the axis of a shared sensi- bility, and this sensibility with or deprived of the presence of a visible tradition, is the sensibility of walking to a New World.1 14 Walcott has captured a new vision. His vision of man is now elemental, a "being inhabited by presences, not a creature chained to the past."1 15 It is the profound and difficult vision of essential unity within the most bitter forms of latent and active historical diversity. A vision that can neither be 'given' nor simply 'inherited.' It had to be discovered by its author with "a pain so alive that / . . . edges a scream/ ... in silent thunder"116 and has to be discovered by his readers, by imagination at full stretch, laying hold of a complex truth perceptible in no other way. I, like the more honest of my race, give a strange and bitter and yet ennobling thanks for the monumental groaning and soldering of two great worlds, like the halves of a fruit seamed by its own bitter juice, that exiled from your own Edens you have placed me in the wonder of another, and that was my inheritance and your gift . . .117 DIANA LYN FOOTNOTES 1.
