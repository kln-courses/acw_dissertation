From televisions and cell phones to refrigerators, many contemporary technologies come with a screen. The article aims at answering this question by employing Emmanuel Levinas' notions of the Other and the face. This article also engages with Don Ihde's conceptualization of alterity relations, in which the technological acts as quasi-other with which we maintain relations. If technology is a quasi-other, then, I claim, the screen is the quasi-face. By exploring Levinas' ontology, specifically what can be identified as his tool analysis, as well as his notion of the face, a new understanding of con temporary technologies can be extracted. Some of these technologies hardly fit into the Heideggerian notion of the hand as the main interface to artifacts. Instead they require the face. Levinas' notion of the face is analyzed from an ontological per spective and developed in conjunction with the screen. As the screen serves as a quasi-face, it enables the construction of quasi-other technological artifacts. Keywords Levinas • Postphenomenology • Cell phone • Technology • Face Introduction Have you ever thought why a cell phone has a screen? While an historical explanation may elucidate how the screen evolved for this particular technological artifact, it is less likely to explain why it got a screen in the first place. The common engineer may answer that there is a need to display digits of a phone number; this answer places importance on the reading of data. However, it ignores the possibility of other means of representation, for example auditory expression. The urge to display data is not unique G.

Wellner to cell phones. Lately some artifacts have also acquired screens, like my new refrigerator that has a screen displaying the temperatures of the fridge and the freezer. Even though the necessity of such information is questionable, I can think of alternative means of conveying the message, such as a single LED that denotes a properly working mode, or a dash-board-like indication. Somehow the screen was selected by the manufacturer with this particular information. Displaying information by means of a LED or a dash-board does not have the same effect as displaying information on a screen. The screen serves as a form of conveying a message, even in its small form and the digit-only display. Beyond displaying data to the user, the refrigerator "expresses" itself, albeit the range of expressions is limited. It is as limited as that of the first generation of cell phones whose display was a simple digit-only screen. For many years the cell phone's ancestor, the landline telephone, had no screen at all. Yet, the cell phone had a screen almost from its very beginning. The first generation of cell phones was characterized by a modest screen. It was a digit-only display of eight-to-ten characters, aimed at showing the phone number of an incoming call or the numbers pressed-down for an outgoing call. Since then, the cell phone's screen has evolved into a large colorful "window" that displays texts, photos, videos, and maps (Wellner 2011 ). Such a display, I argue, enables more than a reading of data; it encourages the user to refer to the cell phone as an "other". The cell phone not only displays various media; it "remembers" contacts, it plays games with the user (sometimes it wins), or it gives directions where to go. Don Ihde (1990) identifies a technology that conducts certain human behavior as "quasi-otherness," maintaining alterity relations with the user. It means that one relates to a technological artifact not as a mute object, but as an object loaded with some human traits, such as retaining memory, conveying relevant information, or providing entertainment. Put differently, quasi-otherness is that quality in objects which positions the human and the object in a human-like relation. Yet, alterity relations can be maintained not only with cell phones but with any technology; the religious context supplies some extreme examples of how artifacts and objects can be treated as an "other". My refrigerator is not a full-fledged other. It is a form of a quasi-other because it has a screen that engages me as a user. My claim is that alterity relations are augmented when a screen is involved. The screen provides a certain focal point which draws one's attention and "promises" to participate in an exchange with the user. Obviously, the screen is not fully equivalent to a human face, evoking noble human values. The technological screen-face is indeed not an ethical face. But human exchange includes a variety of layers of communications, not all of which are ethical. So does the face. The screen is a subset of a face. It shares a few elements with the human face. It is a quasi-face. While the screen relates to the face, other technologies relate to different bodily organs. For example, the wheel has a particular relation to the human leg; their ends are similar (enabling one to get from point A to point B) but their executions are different (in form, material, control, flow, operation, etc.). The wheel can be constructed as quasi-leg—the wheel is not a leg, nor is it an enhancement of a leg. It relates to the leg in a particular form making it a quasi-leg. In a similar fashion, the screen is not a face, yet it relates to the face in a particular form. It is a quasi-face. It engages with the face in a certain way. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="3">The Quasi-Face of the Cell Phone 301 Emmanuel Levinas is widely known for his ethical analysis of the alterity of the Other and the face. In this essay I turn from the ethical to the ontological and discuss Levinas' tool analysis. I show how this analysis calls for a shift from the importance conferred to the hand as the main interfacing organ towards the face. If an ethical analysis reserves the face to the human, the ontological investigation allows a gradation in which animals and technologies can participate. Next, I turn to Postphenomenology's alterity relations and examine how this gradation works in order to rethink the relations between humans and technologies. Finally, I return to the screen and its quasi-facial quality. "We Live from Good Soup" Martin Heidegger in Being and Time (Heidegger 1996) gives an account of Being in-the-world using negative vocabulary such as thrownness, fear, and Angst (de Beistegui 2005). The human being (as Dasein) is thrown into the world, finding itself—in the best case scenario—working with a hammer in a workshop. While working, Heidegger's human does not enjoy work, food, or hospitality. As Levinas says, "Dasein in Heidegger is never hungry" (1995: 134). The setting in Being and Time does not invoke any feelings towards objects, let alone other human beings. It is a world of solitude (Harman 2002). Levinas, a former student of Heidegger, portrays a different human being that enjoys the surrounding world. Levinas' basic assumption is that "we live from 'good soup,' air, light, spectacles, work, ideas, sleep, etc... These are not objects of representations. We live from them" (1995: 110). Heidegger's worker in a Levinasian setting could have smelled the hammer hitting the nail, heard the knock, and dreamt of a good soup, all at the same time. Levinas' positive spirit and the emphasis on the enjoyment are in striking contrast to Heidegger's negativity (Peperzak 1999: 134). Levinas continues, "[t]he things we live from are not tools, nor even implements, in the Heideggerian sense of the term. They are always in a certain measure—and even the hammers, needles, and machines are—object of enjoyment, presenting themselves to 'taste,' already adorned, embellished" (1991: 110). According to Levinas, our relations with things and tools are not only relations of utility but also involve a full sense of our well-being. While Levinas criticizes Heidegger's approach to technology, the purpose of this article is not to draw the outlines of such a critic (though it may occasionally arise). The aim is to understand Levinas' own approach to technology and then examine how it can be further developed with his notion of the face. The Levinasian Tool Analysis One cannot easily find Levinas' tool analysis and the reader of Totality and Infinity has to look for clues and scattered comments to construct it. Such difficulty may be imputed to the priority Levinas confers to the ethical over the metaphysical, and to the metaphysical over the ontological (1995: 42-47, 77f.). The ontological is &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="4">302 G. Wellner concerned with beings, which is Heidegger's starting point in Being and Time (1996). One type of being is the thing. Levinas, like his teacher, analyzes concrete things, which he defines as "solids with contours clearly delimited" (1995: 160). Objects, according to Heidegger and Levinas, are therefore lifeless physical things which humans can see or touch.1 Levinas is not only limited to "solids with contours clearly delimited," but is also rooted in the world of mechanical technologies. He implicitly follows Heidegger's neglecting of electronic artifacts (Ihde 2009: 40), thereby concerning himself with mechanical technologies that have no screens, at least not as a main interface. Both thinkers do not analyze screen technologies such as television or cinema. Furthermore, Levinas' concept of the machine is to some extent Utopian, since he considers "the wheels of machinery [to be] perfectly adjusted to one another and form an unbroken continuity" (1995: 167). He ignores the fact that machines do break down from time to time,2 albeit it is in line with his "good soup" prism through which he looks at the world. Screen technologies, and the ever-growing space they occupy in our everydayness may call for a reconsideration of some of Levinas' assertions. The relation between humans and things, according to Levinas, is one of "living from". It is dramatically different from Heidegger's (1996) readiness-to-hand (Zuhandenheit) and presence-at-hand (Vorhandenheit). The former is the mere usage in which a tool, such as a hammer, withdraws to the background, so that the user's attention is focused on the work and not on the tool; the latter complements the former by denoting a situation in which the user pays attention to the tool as such, as in the case of a broken, unusable, or missing tool. Heidegger uses the example of a hammer to define the readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand. It is an example in which the user concentrates only on work. What is missing in Heidegger's analysis is that our use of technology is not necessarily a mere means to-an-end, but also an experience and a sensing of one's being. Levinas uses the same tool as an example of a thing to portray enjoyment relations in which the human bearer depends on the tool she deploys for her own well Being-in-the-world. Levinas expounds, "[t]he enjoyment of a thing, be it a tool, does not consist simply in bringing this thing to the usage for which it is fabricated—the pen for the writing, the hammer to the nail to be driven in—but also in suffering or rejoicing over this operation" (1995: 133). Being-with-a-tool, according to Levinas, is working with a tool while sensing one's body and physical application (1995: 110). A tool is more than something-in-order-to; it is something that makes us feel, be it a sufferance or an enjoyment. Levinas clarifies, "[o]ne can like one's job, enjoy these material 1 Thus, intellectual property such as novels, movies, or software code is excluded from their analysis of things. Like Heidegger, Levinas does not deal with Husserlian temporal objects, like music or written works, which require us to think in term of "consciousness of..." (Ihde 2010). 2 As reflected in Heidegger's present-at-hand notion as well as in Deleuze and Guattari's (1983) notion of abstract machine. But while Deleuze and Guattari in later writing do refer to modern technologies such as television (1987), Levinas ignores television and even cinema, and remains bounded by the Heideggerian hammer and pen, or other traditional technologies such as clothing and dwelling. For Deleuze and Guattari machines like television and their users are entangled in such a way that the users are no longer users, but rather parts of larger machines. Their machine allows us to imagine a future where the "users" will break the "larger machine" they compose with the television. For Levinas, there is no need to break from the machine, because technologies help us live good lives.

Activity does not derive its meaning and its value from an ultimate and unique goal" (1995: 133). The enjoyment is so central in Levinas' conceptualization of tools that he goes on and asserts, "[t]o enjoy without utility, in pure loss, gratuitously, without referring to anything else, in pure expenditure—this is the human" (1995: 133). The construct of Homo Faber has therefore additional aspects, in which there is no predetermined goal, no in-order-to. These aspects make Homo Faber a human being. In a sense, it is a meeting point between Homo Faber and Homo Ludens. We may enjoy a tool, as Levinas notes, without thinking what it is good for, or its presence-at-hand, as Heidegger does.3 Levinas thinks of the human experience regardless whether the tool functions or not, while Heidegger thinks that once the tool breaks down it is the tool that we think of, and not our experience with it. Hence, "living/rom" and the accompanying enjoyment open the horizon for feelings and sensations that exceed the Heideggerian in-order-to relations. Levinas' positive approach to technologies is reflected not only in Totality and Infinity, but also in his article, Heidegger, Gagarin and Us, published in 1961, the same year Totality and Infinity appeared. In this article he refers to technologies more explicitly, in response to Heidegger's essay The Question Concerning Technology (1977). While Heidegger criticizes modern technologies such as the hydroelectric dam on the river Rhine, Levinas is optimistic with regards to such technologies and other new developments. He refers the techno-scientific achieve ment of Yuri Gagarin flying to space as an example to modern technologies and writes, What is admirable about Gagarin's feat is certainly not his magnificent performance at Luna Park which impresses the crowds; it is not the sporting achievement of having gone further than the others and broken the world records for height and speed. What counts more is the probable opening up to new forms of knowledge and new technological possibilities, Gagarin's personal courage and virtues, the science that made the feat possible, and everything which that in turn assumes in the way of abnegation and sacrifice. (1997: 233, emphasis added) Levinas refuses to follow what he considers as the common Utopian view on Gagarin. At the same time he rejects the Heideggerian dystopian-romantic approach to technology according to which opening to the world equals to a return to nature.4 Moreover, Levinas criticizes the enframing (Gestell) approach in The Question Concerning Technology, in which modern technologies are responsible for setting the world as a "standing reserve" (Bestand). Instead, he sees technology as an opening up of a new horizon for human beings. Whereas Heidegger sees a 3 Considered nowadays, it makes sense of the contemporary practice of setting a colorful wall-paper for the cell phone's display, without thinking what it is good for. 4 This basic approach to technology is also characteristic of postphenomenology which rejects both the technophobic and technophile discourses, and focuses on the possibilities that the combinations of human and technology open for us (Ihde 1990; Selinger 2006: 9; Verbeek 2005: 104). Springer</page><page sequence="6">304 G. Wellner dangerous future imposed by modern technologies, Levinas is optimistic when he looks ahead because of the "new technological possibilities".5 To conclude, Levinas rejects Heidegger's early tool analysis in Being and Time and specifically the in-order-to approach, as well as the Enframing approach in The Question Concerning Technology. The world according to Levinas is a human centric world and can thus be brighter and more playful. We can enjoy it with or without utilities. In Levinas' world, what is important is that we can enjoy the act of working and using tools, as well as seeing the results of the work. The focus is on the human experience. Departing from a human experience point-of-view, Levinas makes a distinction between equipment (Zeug) and things necessary for living, which include "furnishings, the home, food, clothing" (1995: 133). Such a distinction makes sense, though he does not explain the difference, nor what it implies.6 In the next section I review Levinas' notion of habitation as a sui generis of "things necessary for living". The Habitation The home for Levinas is not a tool nor is it a yet-another "thing-necessary-for living". It cannot be understood solely as something-in-order-to because it is not "an ultimate end" by itself (Levinas 1995: 152). The home has a privileged role because it is the condition for the human and not its end. The home is an essential part of the human and his or her Being-in-the-world. We are not "thrown" into the world, as Heidegger maintains; rather we are kept safe at home and peacefully interact with the world's elements from within our home.7 Outside the home, there are elements of the world and in the world, according to Levinas, such as "earth, sea, light, [and] city" (1995: 131). These elements, unlike things in the home, do not interact with the human directly because they are too abstract. Levinas explains, To tell the truth the element has no side at all. One does not approach it. The relation adequate to its essence discovers it precisely as a medium: one is steeped in it; I am always within the element. Man has overcome the elements 5 There is a vibrant discussion whether Heidegger in The Question Concerning Technology is opening new horizon or looking back. For the former see Ihde (1979); Harman (2002); Lash (2002); Ihde (2010); Riis (2011) for the latter see Feenberg (1999); Scharff and Dusek (2003: 247); Wendling (2011). But my focus here is Levinas' analysis of 1961 which takes the latter position rather than the former. 6 Similar list of things necessary for living can be found in Marx and Engel's German Ideology, in the first paragraph of the chapter "History: Fundamental Conditions" in Part I on Feuerbach (1970): "life involves before everything else eating and drinking, a habitation, clothing and many other things". 7 Levinas' elements may remind the reader Heidegger's classification of nature in the context of presence-at-hand: "nature must not to be understood here as what is merely objectively present [present at-hand, GW1 nor as the power of nature. The forest is a forest of timber, the mountain a quarry of rock, the river is water power, the wind is wind 'in the sails'" (1996: 66). Nature, for Heidegger, is a ready-to hand that is in-order-to, In later writing (Heidegger 1977), he develops the Gestell relation to these elements, an enframing, where they are no more than standing reserve. By contrast, for Levinas the elements can be interacted from within the home. ■£) Springer</page><page sequence="7">The Quasi-Face of the Cell Phone 305 only by surmounting this interiority without issue by the domicile, which confers upon him an extraterritoriality. He gets a foothold in the elemental by a side already appropriated: a field cultivated by me, the sea in which I fish and moor my boats, the forest in which I cut wood; and all these acts, all this labor, refer to the domicile. (1995: 131) The home keeps the elements at a distance, while enabling the interaction with them. Yet, the home is beyond mere exteriority: "the domicile, condition for all property, renders the inner life possible" (Levinas 1995: 132). The habitation is a necessary departure point for Being-in-the-world, making being-with-myself possible. Put differently, the home is fundamental for the human. Levinas posits, "it would be impossible [for] a being [to be without] dwelling" (1995: 159).8 To be human is to dwell. Habitation for Levinas is a human condition, to use Hannah Arendt's terms. The home is a condition for the human because it not only protects us but also enables us to interact with what is at distance. For the interaction to take place, a window and a door are necessary. The window provides an opening to the world, or in Levinas' words, "the dwelling remains in its own way open upon the element from which it separates. The ambiguity of distance, both removal and connection, is lifted by the window" (1995: 156). While the home places the elements at a distance, through the window one can see, hear, and smell the world's elements. The window enables a sort of "safe mode" of interaction with the elements. A home also has a door that provides the means for others to enter. Levinas writes, "I welcome the [Other] who presents himself in my home by opening my home to him" (1995: 171). While elements selectively enter the home through the window, the door enables others to enter without "selection".9 According to Levinas, the window and the door are unique to the home. They make interaction possible. As concepts, the window and the door have gained additional meaning in contemporary culture by denoting an alternative interaction with computers (e.g., windows, gateways). They transform technological environ ments into a more human-friendly setting. They contribute to a sense of being-at home when we work in front of our computers. The window of a computer invites elements into our "home page" while the door/gateway lets other interact with the user, despite viral dangers. Yet the construction of a certain technology with the fundamentals of another is difficult. A more Levinasian strategy is to characterize types of technologies by their relations to the human user and the experiences of the world that these technologies mediate for their users. Hence, the computer and the cell phone will be described through the prism of the screen, just as the habitation is described through the prism of the window and the door. 8 My corrections. In the original: "Il serait impossible à un être sans demeure" (p. 170 in the French text). The translation to English is: "It would be impossible in a being that had no dwelling". 9 Levinas welcomes others into his home through the door, as he recommends keeping the door open to the Other (1995: 171). In Otherwise than Being (1981), his next publication, he discusses the destructive dangers of welcoming others into the home. Springer</page><page sequence="8">306 G. Wellner Tools and Organs As mentioned before, Levinas makes a distinction between equipment and things necessary for living and within the latter—a classification into habitation, clothing, and food. But such classification is dictated by the in-order-to relations between the user and the technology, a Heideggerian criterion that Levinas expressly rejects. If one follows Levinas' line of thinking, then the classification should be made by the experience produced from the interaction between the human and the artifact. One possible distinction can be that of the bodily organ required for the operation of a technology. A hammer requires a hand; food requires a face. Such a classification reveals another aspect of the chasm between Heidegger and Levinas, reflected in the different organs each thinker makes reference to: the hand for Heidegger and the face for Levinas. The organ with which one approaches technology can define that technology. Therefore I suggest distinguishing between technologies of the hand and technologies of the face. Technologies of the hand include the traditional technologies such as a hammer, a needle, and a pen, but also keyboard, mouse, and remote control.10 Using these technologies require the hand, and not so much the face. I can knit without looking at the needle and type without looking at the keyboard. Technologies of the face include traditional technologies such as a painting, a theater performance or a book, as well as modern (and postmodern) media technologies, such as the cinema, TV, computers, and cell phones. Although these media technologies are facial, they are sometimes combined with hand technologies like TV's remote control, the computer's keyboard, or the cell phone's handset.11 In the next sections I review Levinas' approaches to the hand and to the face, the former mostly ontological, the latter mostly ethical. In the final section I assess the ontological aspects of the face. The Hand For Levinas "the hand is by essence groping and emprise" (1995: 167). The hand serves for investigating the material world. One can find three distinct ways of using the hand for investigating the world in Totality and Infinity: the usage of objects, labor, and ownership. Levinas describes usage of objects as entangled with the hand, so that "the form of all objects call for the hand and the grasp. By the hand the object is in the end comprehended, touched, taken, borne[,] and referred to other objects, clothed with a signification, by reference to other objects" (1995: 191). The hand serves to grasp objects in the world and investigate them. The hand, according to Levinas, is the major organ for interacting and interfacing with objects. It is an organ for using objects. In this sense Levinas echoes Heidegger (1996), who stresses that the 10 Heidegger refers to additional technologies such as the invisible and untouchable hydroelectric dam. These technologies do not require the hand, let alone the body of the user (here one should distinguish between an operator and a user). They are in the background, see Ihde (1990). 11 For the role of the hand in the interface with a computer see Irwin (2006). Springer</page><page sequence="9">The Quasi-Face of the Cell Phone 307 relations with objects, be it ready-to-hand or present-at-hand, are relations with the hand. For Heidegger, regardless of the state of the tools, it is via the hand that a relation to an object is established. Levinas adds, Only a being endowed with organs can conceive a technical finality, a relation between the end and the tool. The end is a term the hand searches for in the risk of missing it. The body as a possibility of a hand—and its whole corporeity can be substituted for the hand—exists in the virtuality of this movement betaking itself towards the tool. (1995: 167) The hand is so central in the operation of the body in the world that Levinas considers the possibility of reducing the body to the hand.12 Both Heidegger (1968) and Levinas maintain the human hand has a prime role in exploring the world and in thinking of the world (see Derrida 1989). The hand does more than using objects; it is an organ of work that transforms the objects and the world. As Frederick Engels says, "[t]he specialization of the hand— this implies the tool, and the tool implies specific human activity, the transforming reaction of man on nature, production" (1954 [1883]: 47). Levinas further articulates, "the hand is thus not only the point at which we communicate a certain quantity of force to matter. It traverses the indétermination of the element, suspends its unforeseeable surprises, postpones the enjoyment in which they already threaten" (1995: 161). That is, the hand is the means to dominate the world's elements while reducing the uncertainties embedded in life. Levinas is committed to a modernist point-of-view according to which science and technologies are the means to control nature as encoded in the world's elements. In its capacity as the organ of work, the hand needs the dwelling, because "without the recollection of the dwelling the hand qua hand cannot arise in the body immersed in the element" (1995: 163). The hand and the home are co-dependent, so that the hand builds the home, and the home enables the hand to store collections and works performed by the hand. The hand thereby serves as the safeguard to the home's window in the interaction with the world. That is why "[t]he dwelling... [is] making acquisition and labor possible" (1995: 165). In addition to being the organ that uses objects and labors, the hand also establishes ownership. Levinas writes, Possession is accomplished in taking-possession or labor, the destiny of the hand. The hand is the organ of grasping and taking, the first and blind grasping in teeming mass: it relates to me, to my egoist ends, things drawn from the element, which, beginningless and endless, bathes and inundates the separated being. But the hand relating the elemental to the finality of needs constitutes things only by separating its take from immediate enjoyment, depositing it in the dwelling, conferring on it the status of a possession. (1995: 159) According to Levinas the destiny of the hand is taking possession. Levinas ties labor and ownership as inter-dependant functions of the hand. A work that does not Thus Deleuze and Guattari's Body without Organs is the next step in this direction of investigation and a further reduction to no organs at all (1987). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="10">308 G. Wellner necessarily require the hand cannot be classified as labor, by Levinas' standards. The hand for Levinas is more than a sensing organ (1995: 161). It is the means to dominate and take possession of the surrounding world. From this commanding and dictating position, the hand (and after it—the body) can use objects, work them and own them. Like work so does possession require the home to store things (1995: 161). But the hand, according to Levinas, has its limitations: "The power of the hand that grasps or tears up or crushes or kneads relates the element, not to an infinity by relation to which the thing would be defined, but to an end in the sense of a goal, to the goal of need" (1995: 160). The hand uses objects, works them and owns them in so far as it uses them as a means-to-an-end. These ontological descriptions of the hand seem to fall in the Heideggerian pattern of in-order-to. The hand is the means and the end (Levinas 1995: 167), and hence absent for the ethical analysis in Totality and Inifinity. Such an analysis is reserved to the face. The Face Levinas declares, "[t]he notion of the face differs from every represented content" (1995: 177). The face is unlike other representations because the "face-iality" of the face does not lie in its visible qualities. The face is more than a mere collection of eyes, nose, cheeks, or mouth which can be seen, touched, or represented (Lenivas 1995: 194). It surpasses its material layout (see Eaglestone 1998: 117; Derrida 1980: 122). It is a "corporeal emblem," to use Bernard Waldenfels' (2004) terms. The face, according to Levinas, is what moves and demands a response from the subject, and yet what moves and demands a response remains inexplicable. Because the face is characterized by something that is not known or understood, Levinas uses, according to Jacques Derrida, a series of negations. Levinas, Derrida says, is "progressing by negations, and by negation against negation" (1980: 112), in order to explain that which cannot be explained in the face. Thus, the face is "often quite ambiguous" (Handleman 1991: 209; see also Eaglestone 1998: 117). Yet the face plays an important role in the presentation of the other. Levinas writes, "[t]he way in which the other presents himself, exceeding the idea of the other in me, we here name face" (1995: 50). As an essential element in the presentation of the other, "[wjhat we call the face is precisely this exceptional presentation of self by self" (1995: 202). The interaction with the Other is based on the face, and hence the face demands an ethical response (Lenivas 1995; Handleman 1991; Derrida 1999; Peperzak 1999; Llewelyn 2002). This article will not examine the ethical features in Levinas' writing. Instead it seeks to reveal the ontological aspects of the face. Face and Habitation Often the face is compared to a dwelling. One analogy describes the face as an entry point that hides interiority. Like a foyer, it provides access to an unreachable ■ö Springer</page><page sequence="11">The Quasi-Face of the Cell Phone 309 unknown interiority (Waldenfels 2004: 63). In so doing, the face gives a sense of transcendentality (see Levinas 1995: 172; Waldenfels 2004: 66f.; Llewelyn 2002; Eaglestone 1998: 117), in which "the presence of the face [is] coming from beyond the world" (Lenivas 1995: 215).13 In some cases the face is paralleled with the façade. Just as the face hides the inner meaning of one's interiority, the façade of the home keeps its secret enclosed "in which it gleams like a splendor but does not deliver itself" (Lenivas 1995: 193). The face and the façade of the home provide an exteriority which makes the interior possible. By being exterior the face and the façade can open a window or a door to the world or to others while keeping the self safe. Having a face and a façade sets the condition for the possibility of interaction. Face and Language Levinas asserts, "[t]he face speaks. The manifestation of the face is already discourse" (1995: 66). The face speaks in two complementary senses: in the words composing a language14 and in the visual representation.15 One of major functions of the face is the exercise of language. "One can, to be sure, conceive of language as an act, as a gesture of behavior. But then one omits the essential of language: the coinciding of the revealer and the revealed in the face" (Lenivas 1995: 67). Susan Handleman (1991: 220) stresses the dual nature of language in the context of the intersubjective relations, as a relation that both maintains the separation between me and the other and bridges it at the same time.16 Whereas the dwelling separates as described above, language separates and bridges. Language exists and operates in the facial relations, yet it is not limited to a specific organ in the face. It can be the mouth, the ear, or even the eye. Moreover, other organs outside the face are possible sites for language as well. For example, "[gjestures and acts produced can become, like words, a revelation" (Lenivas 1995: 67). Language, according to Levinas, becomes "not only verbal signs but all signs 13 Unlike immanent objects, "the face resists possession, resists my powers" (Lenivas 1995: 197). Eaglestone criticizes Levinas for asserting transcendence instead of arguing for it (1998: 117). 14 The words composing the discourse are a manifestation the interaction with the other. Words are part of a language. Levinas places importance on the role of language. He writes, "fljanguage is not enacted within a consciousness; it comes to me from the other and reverberates in consciousness by putting it in question" (1995: 204). Levinas adds, "language does not exteriorize a representation preexisting in me: it puts in common a world hitherto mine. Language effectuates the entry of things into a new ether in which they receive a name and become concepts. It is the first action over and above labor" (1995: 174). Language, according to Levinas, is not a tool because it is abstract and because it is prior to labor. It conditions labor and is not part of labor. Language does not make the interiority representable in an external spoken world, rather language is the discourse spoken that affects the self in being spoken. While Heidegger presupposes a language that already exists and into which one is born and with which one becomes human, Levinas maintains that language operates within us in a way more complex. 15 The visual representation, although unlike any other representation, is "[t]he manifestation of the face [whichj is already discourse" (Lenivas 1995: 66). 16 Moreover, language participates in the thinking process. It not only "conditions the functioning of rational thought" (Lenivas 1995: 204), but also "[language conditions thought" (1995: 204). This is in contrast to Heidegger (1968) who thinks with the hand (Derrida 1989). Springer</page><page sequence="12">310 G. Wellner can serve as language" (1995: 182). Language is not limited to spoken or written discourse. The body can talk via the clothing one puts on, and the hands can talk via gestures (Waldenfels 2004: 65). The extension of the site of language from the face to the body broadens the notion of discourse from words spoken to gestures. A further extension is suggested in the shift from bodily organs to externalities such as clothing that serve as signs. Can other functions of the face be delegated to artifacts? Is it feasible to "de sanctify" the face and leave the ethical level to a somewhat lower ontological level? Can we attribute a face to non humans? Fig. 1 The face dichotomy Face and Technologies While the face is a major ingredient of the human, things and animals do not have a face (Levinas 1995: 140; Waldenfels 2004: 67f.; Atterton 2011). Even pagan gods do not have a face, according to Levinas (1995: 160). The face for Levinas is uniquely reserved for human beings. Things, technologies included, are accordingly faceless in Levinas' thought because they are lifeless physical things which humans can use, work on or possess (see Fig. 1). I would like to suggest a more nuanced approach to the face, allowing animals to have a face and technologies a quasi-face. The proposed approach is ontological and is not focused on the unique ethical implications of the human face. The ontological proposition stretches along a spectrum that goes from the human on one end to the faceless object on the other. In between are located the allegedly faceless animals and technologies which can be understood as having a quasi-face (see Fig. 2). The ethical burden can be allocated along such a spectrum, in which the human face bares the most significant ethical consequences, and the technological quasi-face has a somewhat reduced ethical call, if at all. The notion of quasi-face softens Levinas' strict and "totalistic" approach to the face that results in a dichotomy of human-nonhuman. Such notion allows animals and technologies to have a permutation of a face by transforming the binary reference to the face to a continuum. i Faceless things, animals, gods... Springer</page><page sequence="13">The Quasi-Face of the Cell Phone 311 Fig. 2 Quasi face, between "faceless" animals and faceless objects Faceless animals A screen of a cell phone is a type of a quasi-face. It opens a window to the face of the other in ways Levinas did not consider; it may allow a discursive exchange with others; it may provide a reduced version of a face. The screen of the cell phone, like a façade of a home, represents an exteriority which hides an interiority. The screen acts like a face that requires a response, but it is not a face. It is a quasi-face. Postphenomenological Quasi-Otherness Don Ihde (1990, 2009) maintains that we cannot imagine the human without technology, i.e., clothing, cooking, or habitation. He identifies four types of relations between humans, their technologies and the surrounding world: embodiment, hermeneutic, alterity, and background relations. In embodiment relations, we experience the world via a technology that becomes part of us, for example, the eyeglasses through which we see. Similarly, the cell phone becomes part of us, merging with our ear and mouth, when we talk with a friend; hermeneutic relations refer to the situation where the technologies used require a "reading" of the world and the attention is on the artifact rather than on the "real world," a screen showing a Facebook message with friends' statuses, for example; alterity relations denote the setting where technology stands as an object next to us, acting as an avatar, like an ATM or an automatic answering service for a cell phone; and background relations occur where the technology operates in the background almost unnoticed, for example, the humming of a refrigerator or the cool fan of an air-conditioner. Each relation ascribes to an aspect of the associations between humans, technologies, and the world. Often the screen is analyzed through the hermeneutic relations prism, in which it serves to display data that is read by human beings. The approach I suggest here shifts the focus from the reading of the screen to a more emotional reference to the screen in which the screen and the artifact behind it are referred as an "other". It is a shift from hermeneutic relations to alterity relations in which technology serves as a quasi-other. Basically, any technology can be the subject of alterity relations. Children maintain such relations with their toys, whether they have faces like dolls Ô Springer</page><page sequence="14">312 G. Wellner and teddy bears, or faceless objects like cars and their favorite blanket. Some religions refer to faceless things as having free will. Ihde explains, "[t]echnological otherness is a quasi-otherness, stronger than mere objectness but weaker than the otherness found within the animal kingdom or the human one" (1990: 100). The construct of quasi-other is located mid way between inanimate objects and living beings. Certain technologies provide an opportunity for more intense alterity relations. Consider the case of an interaction with an ATM. One communicates with the technological device as if it were a human teller in a bank. But it is not, it is merely a computerized machine with a screen. It provides communication with a quasi-other. The dialog with the machine produces an augmented form of alterity, whether the dialog is written or spoken (as in the case of telephonic menus). Ihde constructs a gradation of otherness, topped by the human, followed by animals, then technologies, and finally—objects or things. Within technologies, cinema, television, and computers are "dramatic forms" of alterity, according to Ihde (1990: 105). They have "enhanced alterity" in comparison to other technologies, because of their ability to display a dynamic picture of the world. These technologies, I argue, have dramatic alterity relations with us, not only because they are dynamic, but because they have a screen. Among them, a computer's and cell phone's screens provide a further increased alterity relations because these technologies are interactive, that is—maintaining a certain dialog with the human operator. This feature allows humans to refer to these technological artifacts in an anthropomorphized way, regardless of the content presented on the screen.17 Therefore, the cell phone's screen serves as a quasi-face, thereby making our relations with the cell phone to be more "human" than the relations we maintain with handy tools and other non-screen technologies. Screen as Quasi-Face The concept of quasi-face as suggested in this article links contemporary technological artifact with the face constructing a "meeting point" at the screen. The screen, I argue, acts as a quasi-face. Statements like "the screen has become humanized" (Vanderbeeken 2011: 247) should be interpreted in a non-anthropo morphized way. I prefer the formulation stating that the screen becomes the quasi face of a technological quasi-other. As quasi-face, the screen, and the face have several meeting points First, both the face and the screen represent interiority without it being externalized. Like a foyer of a home which does not reveal the inside, the screen is the exteriority of software codes. If the face is like a theater for displaying feelings and thoughts without exposing the back stage, then the screen is like a theater for displaying multimedia contents without exposing the algorithms operating "behind the screen". In this sense, a "poker face" is equivalent to an empty screen, for it 17 Quasi-other should be carefully constructed in order to avoid anthropomorphism, through "a phenomenologically relativistic analysis" (Ihde 1990: 99). Springer</page><page sequence="15">The Quasi-Face of the Cell Phone 313 does not show feelings and thoughts, while the interiority remains veiled. In addition, just as one cannot be in touch with the other's interiority (Lenivas 1995: 194), one cannot touch the content that is displayed on the screen. A touch screen, although involving touching, brings to the surface a display of contents while not changing the "back stage". Second, the screen, like the face, serves as a communicative interface. While the face serves as an inter-face point between humans, the screen serves as an interface point between humans and their technologies. It can present the face of another person, distant in place or time; it can present a representation of a collective, as in the case of websites that aggregate contents from many users; and it can represent a technological other, as in the case of a cell phone that greets with the word "welcome" on its opening screen or enabling interaction with an imaginary figure like Talking Tom Cat.18 Third, both types of interface function on the basis of language. Language enables a dialog, an exchange of thoughts, needs, and wishes with the other or the quasi-other. The interaction with the screen amounts to a language in the sense of providing commands and performing certain actions. While human language is expressive so that "discourse founds signification,"19 the human-to-screen dialogue is designed to be operational. Human language signifies; the screen's language, because of its instructional makeup, is intended to operate applications in an unambiguous definite way. A quasi-face has therefore a quasi-language.20 Moreover, while being a display on a material surface, the screen responds to the interactions with the human. It responds to humans commands, though the responses are not necessarily those intended (see the experience of using a search engine to find a relevant answer; see Rosenberger 2007). The face responds; the screen is a displayed response. Fourth, the face and the screen extend beyond "physical boundaries". The face's extensions are other expressive organs such as the hands. The screen's extensions are peripherals like the keypad of the cell phone or the microphone. These peripherals enable the interaction with the technological artifact, i.e., by typing on a keypad or giving oral instructions via the microphone. An anthropomorphic approach would have consider the keypad and mouse as hands that write, the speaker as a mouth that makes sounds, the microphone as an ear that can listen to oral inputs and the embedded camera as eyes. These organs assist the artifact in communicating with the user, and in the case of the human to communicate with the other. Fifth, the face is never a neutral display, nor is the screen. The screen-as-quasi face may explain why we expect the screen to present truth. If it fails to do so, we become disappointed, just like confronting a "lying face". But behind the face there is a single Other that operates while behind the screen there are many humans and non-humans. http://outfit7.com/character/talking-tom/ (accessed March 20, 2013). 19 As the headline of Totality and Infinity's, chapter III.B.4. states. See also Lenivas 1995: 73. 20 Additionally, unlike the human language, the screen's language is not a condition for thought (Levinas 1995: 204), nor does it amount to justice (Levinas 1995: 213). Ô Springe</page><page sequence="16">314 G. Wellner Though the screen is comparable to the face, there is one major difference between them. The human face demands an ethical response. Even if the screen may produce such an effect, it is not necessarily designed to be ethical (see van de Poel and Verbeek 2006; Verbeek 2005; Verbeek 2009). The ethical aspect of the face exceeds the ontological one (Levinas 1995: 201). The screen, however, remains on the ontological level. To sum up, while the screen and the face are obviously not the same, the screen can serve to display certain human functions. In order to do so the humanist-dichotomist approach should be replaced, and a quasi-face needs to be accounted for. The coupling of a screen to technologies like the cell phone and the refrigerator facilitates the reference to the technological artifact as a quasi-other. It may elevate the relations from the human-thing level to the quasi-inter-subjective level turning them into alterity relations. In such relations, technological alienation looks outdated and irrelevant. Summary The question of why the cell phone got its screen concerned me in this article. A hermeneutic agenda, that is—the presentation of data to be read by the user, could have been the original motivation for the inclusion of the screen in cell phones; but it may turn out that artifacts enhanced by a screen tend to be more interactive and create not only hermeneutic relations but also alterity relations. This answer may also hint at the driving forces behind the cell phone's evolution from a voice-centric tool to a multi-media platform like iPhone that displays a large variety of information types. During this evolution, more and more interactions with the cell phone are performed with relation to the screen. The screen has become a major component of the cell phone and the need to display data may explain a certain range of usages. Alterity relations illuminate other usages. In this article I focused on the ontological aspects of Levinas theory. I explored his tool analysis and looked at habitation as an example of a technology that has no face but interacts with the human user through the door and the window. Remaining committed to the rejection of the Heideggerian in-order-to relations, I offered a classification of technologies by the mediating organ, which resulted in technologies of the face and technologies of the hand. Technologies that consist of a screen are technologies of the face as they require the human face to interact with. The cell phone, like other media technologies, requires the user's face to look at it (e.g., when reading an email or seeing who is calling) or listen to it (e.g., during a telephone conversation), or both actions at the same time (e.g., when watching a video clip). While the user's face is required, the hand—traditionally an important organ in the interaction between users and tools—is optional (e.g., cell phone's hands-free operation in cars). This is an example of the different experiences produced by hand technologies compared to those produced by face technologies. By understanding Levinas' claims with respect to the face, one can realize that the cell phone's screen functions in modes comparable to that of the face. As the screen becomes a quasi-face, the dialog with the cell phone becomes a face-to 0 Springer</page><page sequence="17">The Quasi-Face of the Cell Phone 315 quasi-face interaction. From a postphenomenological perspective, the cell phone technology is not only a quasi-other with which one maintains alterity relations as Ihde notes, it also has a quasi-face and hence alterity is enhanced. My claim is that the screen is the perfect example of a quasi-face. From a historical perspective, the quasi-face may explain why the cell phone's screen has been enriched with multi-media, so that it becomes closer to the face. It may also explain why numerous developers and manufacturers of consumer goods prefer to attach a screen to a variety of artifacts, including cell phones and refrigerators, in an effort to make them slightly more human.
