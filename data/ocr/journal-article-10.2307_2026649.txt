<plain_text><page sequence="1">+_ * -+ THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY VOLUME LXXXVI, NO. 8, AUGUST 1989 REALISM AND THE HISTORICITY OF KNOWLEDGE T HE problem described in the title is not new. In the West it arose with the Presocratics; it was formulated by Plato and Aristotle, dismantled by the rise of modern science, and reappeared with quantum mechanics and the increasing strength of historical (as opposed to theoretical) accounts of knowledge. Stated briefly, the problem consists in the following question: How can information that is the result of idiosyncratic historical changes be about history-independent facts and laws? To examine the problem, I shall replace it by two assumptions and the difficulties that arise from their common use. I. THE ASSUMPTIONS The first assumption is that the theories, facts, and procedures that constitute the (scientific) knowledge of a particular time are the results of specific and highly idiosyncratic historical developments. Many events support this assumption. The Greeks had the mathe- matics and the intelligence to develop the theoretical views that arose in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, yet they failed to do so. "Chinese Civilization," writes J. Needham,' "had been much more effective than the European in finding out about Nature and using natural knowledge for the benefit of mankind for fourteen centuries or so before the scientific revolution," and yet this revolution oc- curred in "backward" Europe: deficient, not good, knowledge led to better knowledge. Babylonian astronomy concentrated on special 1 Science in Traditional China (New York: Cambridge, 1981), pp. 3, 22ff. For details, cf. the sections of Needham et al., Science and Civilisation in China (New York: Cambridge, 1956ff), esp. vol. v, pt. VII. A brief but suggestive comparison of simultaneous developments in Greece and China is found in the articles by Jacques Gernet and Jean-Pierre Vernant in Vernant, Myth and Society in Ancient Greece, (New York: Norton, 1988), pp. 79ff. 0022-362X/89/8608/393-406 (? 1989 The Journal of Philosophy, Inc. 393</page><page sequence="2">394 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY events, such as the first visibility of the moon after a new moon, and constructed algorithms for predicting them. Trajectories, a celestial sphere, and the considerations of spherical trigonometry played no role in these algorithms. Greek astronomy posited first physical (Anaximander), then geometrical trajectories, and built on them. Both methods were empirically adequate and capable of refinement (equants, excenters, epicycles in Greek astronomy, polygons instead of step functions or zigzag functions in the Babylonian alternative). Cultural factors, not empirical adequacy, determined the survival of the one and the disappearance of the other.2 Recent studies added impressive evidence to these general obser- vations. Historians of science examining the microstructure of scien- tific research, especially of modern high-energy physics, found many points of contact between the establishment of a scientific result and the conclusion of a complicated political treaty. Even experimental "facts" turned out to depend on compromises between different groups with different experiences, different philosophies, different financial backing, and different bits of high theory to support their position. Numerous anecdotes confirm the historico-political nature of scientific practice.3 The second assumption is that what has been found in this idio- syncratic and culture-dependent way (and is therefore formulated and explained in idiosyncratic and culture-dependent terms) exists independently of the circumstances of its discovery. We can cut the way from the result without losing the result. I shall call this assump- tion the separability assumption. The separability assumption, too, can be supported by a variety of reasons. Indeed, who would deny that there were atoms long before the scintillation screen and mass spectroscopy, that they obeyed the laws of quantum theory long before those laws were written down, and that they will continue to do so when the last human being has disappeared from earth? And is it not true that the discovery of America, which was the result of political machinations set in motion 2 The idea that Greek astronomy was inherently superior reflects part of the evidence which has stable theories on the one side and a rapidly growing research programme on the other. But the growth here and the stability there did not come from empirical successes or obstacles; it came from different social conditions; cf. G. E. R. Lloyd, The Revolution of Wisdom (Berkeley: California U P, 1987), ch. 2. 3 Details in Andrew Pickering, Constructing Quarks (Chicago: University Press, 1984); Peter Galison, How Experiments End (Chicago: University Press, 1987); and the September 1988 issue of Isis. Anecdotes are unpopular among logicians who see science propelled by the rational use of rational principles. They become im- portant once scientific practice has been reintegrated with history.</page><page sequence="3">REALISM AND THE HISTORICITY OF KNOWLEDGE 395 by false beliefs and erroneous estimates and which was misread by the great Columbus himself, did in no way affect the properties of the continent discovered? It does not matter that some philosophers have objected to sweeping judgments such as these and have urged us to let science speak for itself, for "science itself" is full of sweep- ing judgments such as those just mentioned.4 So far we have seen the two assumptions that underly the problem; now for the difficulties. II. THE DIFFICULTIES The separability assumption is not only part of science but also of nonscientific traditions. According to Herodotus and Greek com- monsense (sixth and fifth centuries B.C.), Homer and Hesiod did not create the gods, they merely enumerated them and described their properties. The gods had existed before and they were supposed to live on, independently of human wishes and mistakes. The Greeks, too, thought they could cut the way from the result without losing the result. Does it follow that our world contains particles and fields side by side with demons and gods? It does not, the defenders of science reply, because gods do not fit into a scientific worldview. But, if the entities postulated by a scien- tific worldview can be assumed to exist independently of it, then why not anthropomorphic gods? True, few people now believe in such gods and those who do only rarely offer acceptable reasons; but the assumption was that existence and belief are different things and that a new Dark Age for science would not obliterate atoms. Why should the Homeric gods-whose Dark Age is now-be treated differently? They must be treated differently, the champions of a scientific worldview reply, because the belief in gods did not just disappear; it was removed by argument. Entities postulated by such beliefs cannot 4Arthur Fine, in an interesting and highly informative book, The Shaky Game (Chicago: University Press, 1986), invites us "to let science stand on its own and to view it without the support of philosophical 'isms' " (9): "try to take science on its own terms, and try not to read things into science" (149). Having proposed a similar view in Against Method (London: New Left, 1975), I have much sympathy for Fine's position, but I cannot accept it as final. Science is not the only enterprise producing existence claims, and scientific arguments not the only "complex net- work of judgements" to "ground" such claims (153). Are we to become complacent relativists and accept as existing whatever people lay on us in a sufficiently compli- cated way ("complex network of judgements"), or should we not rather choose among networks and find reasons for our choice? At any rate, there are enough "objective" existence claims contained in molecular biology, the theory of evolu- tion, cosmology, even in high energy physics (cf. Pickering, op. cit., p. 404, on the "retrospective realism" of scientists) to bring the difficulties of the next section right into the center of science.</page><page sequence="4">396 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY be said to exist separately. They are illusions, or "projections"; they have no significance outside the projecting mechanism. But the Greek gods were not "removed by argument." The oppo- nents of popular beliefs about the gods never offered reasons that, using commonly held assumptions, showed the inadequacy of the beliefs. What we do have is a gradual social change leading to new concepts and new stories built from them. To see this, consider two early objections against the gods of Homer. The first objection occurs in a well-known lampoon by Xenophanes,5 the traveling philosopher. Ethiopians, he says, picture their gods as snubnosed and black; Thracians as blue-eyed and blond. And he adds: But if cattle, or lions, or horses had hands, just like humans; If they could paint with their hands, and draw and thus create pictures then the horses in drawing their gods would draw horses; and cattle would give us pictures and statues of cattle; and therefore each would picture the gods to resemble their own constitution (ibid., fragment 15). In contrast, the "true" god is described as follows: One god alone is the greatest, the greatest of gods and of men not resembling the mortals, neither in shape nor in insight. Always without any movement he remains in a single location as it would be unseemly to walk now to this, now to that place. Totally vision; totally knowledge; totally hearing. But without effort, by insight alone, he moves all that is (ibid., 23-26). Can these lines be expected to convert a convinced "Ethiopian" or "Thracian"? Not a chance! For the obvious reply is: "You, Xeno- phanes, seem to dislike our gods-but you have not shown that they don't exist. What you did show is that they are tribal gods, that they look and act like us and that they differ from your own idea of god as a superintellectual. But why should such a monster be a measure of existence"? Xenophanes's mockery can even be inverted, as we see from a remark by Timon of Phleios, a pupil of Pyrrho: Xenophanes, semi-pretentious, made mincemeat of Homer's decep- tions, fashioned a god, far from human, equal in all his relations, lacking in pain and in motion and better at thinking than thought.6 5 In Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, Diels-Kranz, eds. (Zurich: Weidmann, 1985), fragment 16. 6 In Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, I, 224.</page><page sequence="5">REALISM AND THE HISTORICITY OF KNOWLEDGE 397 The upshot is that Xenophanes's mockery works only if the entity he wants to introduce already impressed itself on the minds of his con- temporaries; it formalizes a historical process, it cannot bring it about. (I suspect that almost all "arguments" that "advance thought" have this feature.) A second early "proof" against polytheism which was recorded by the Aristotelian school7 makes the situation even clearer. According to the proof, god is either one or many if many, then either equal or unequal if equal, then like the members of a democracy but gods are not members of a democracy, hence unequal but if unequal, the lesser is not a god hence god is one. The proof assumes that being divine means the same as having su- preme power. This was not true of the Homeric gods. Again, the proof hits its aim only after the needed change in the notion of divinity has occurred: history, not argument, undermined the gods. But history cannot undermine anything, at least not according to the separability assumption. This assumption still forces us to admit the existence of the Homeric gods.8 It does not force us, scientific realists object, because a belief in anthropomorphic gods, though perhaps not removed by reason, never was a reasonable belief. Only entities postulated by reasonable beliefs can be separated from their history. I shall call this the modi- fied separability assumption. Now, making reasonability a measure of separable existence means assuming that things are adapted to criteria of existence and not the other way around. Scientific practice does not conform to this as- 7 In On Melissus, Xenophanes, Gorgias, 977 al4ff. 8 Marcello Pera objected that I used too narrow a notion of "argument" to make my point. I reply that by 'argument' I mean any story that can be told in a relatively short time, has the purpose of showing that the Homeric gods do not exist, and does this in an "intellectual" way, i.e., using propositions and not procedures such as terror, hypnosis, etc. It should also be added that the ancient gods were not creatures of fantasy, but a living presence. In hardhearded Rome, they even participated in the political pro- cess. Cf. Against Method, rev. ed. (London: Verso, 1988), ch. 16 (Homeric gods); Robin Lane Fox, Pagans and Christians (New York: Norton, 1987), pt. 1, sect. 4 (title: "Seeing the Gods"-late Roman Empire); and Donald Strong, Roman Art (London: Penguin, 1982) (Roman Republic and Empire through the fourth Cen- tury). The triune God of Christianity and the saints profoundly influenced the arts, the philosophy, and the politics of the West and this not only in retrospect, but for those who worked out the details.</page><page sequence="6">398 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY sumption, and rightly so. Birds are said to exist because we can see them, catch them, and hold them in our hand. The procedure is useless in the case of alpha-particles, and the criteria used for identi- fying alpha-particles do not help us with distant galaxies or with the neutrino. Quarks, for a time, were a doubtful matter, partly because the experimental evidence was controversial, partly because new cri- teria were needed for entities allegedly incapable of existing in isola- tion ("confinement"). We can measure temperature with a ther- mometer; but this does not get us very far. The temperature in the center of the sun cannot be measured with any known instrument, and the temperature of events such as the first few seconds of the universe was not even defined before the arrival of the second law of thermodynamics. In all these cases, criteria were adapted to things and they changed and proliferated when new things entered the stage. To say that the Homeric gods do not exist because they cannot be found by experiment or because the effects of their actions can- not be reproduced violates this procedure. For if Aphrodite exists, and if she has the properties and idiosyncracies ascribed to her, then she certainly will not sit still for something as silly and demeaning as a test of reproducible effects (shy birds, people who are easily bored, and undercover agents behave in a similar way). Let me dwell a little on this point. "A wise man," says Hume9 (and many scientists agree), "proportions his belief to the evidence." Ar- istotle elaborates: Of all beings naturally composed some [the stars] are ungenerated and imperishable for the whole of eternity, but others are subject to com- ing-to-be and perishing. It has come about that in relation to the former * . .the studies we can make are less, because both the starting points of the inquiry and the things we long to know about present extremely few appearances to observation. We are better equipped to acquire knowl- edge about the perishable plants and animals because they grow beside us. Both studies have their attractions. Though we grasp only a little of the former, yet because the information is valuable we gain more plea- sure than from everything around us, just as a small and random glimpse of those we love pleases us more than seeing many other things large and in detail. But the latter, because the information about them is better and more plentiful, take the advantage in knowledge... But the epistemic power ascribed to areas of research does not con- form to this principle. Artisans at all times possessed detailed infor- mation about the properties of materials and of their behavior under 9 An Enquiry Concerning the Understanding, sect. x. 10 Aristotle, De Partibus Animalium, i, 5.</page><page sequence="7">REALISM AND THE HISTORICITY OF KNOWLEDGE 399 the most varied of circumstances, whereas theories of matter from Democritus to Dalton were considerably less specific and their con- nections with the evidence much more tenuous." Yet questions of reality and of suitable methods of discovery were often formulated in their terms, not in artisan terms. The information of artisans did not even count as knowledge. More recently, hydrodynamics and the theory of elasticity, though connected with experience in many ways, received a place far below abstract mechanics (Lagrange, Hamilton). Even comprehensive sciences, such as chemistry and biology, for a long time were assigned a secondary role in the hierarchy of the sciences. When the time scale of mid-nineteenth-century geology and biology exceeded the estimates of the solar age as determined by physicists (such as Helmholtz and Kelvin) and corresponding esti- mates of the cooling of the earth's surface, prevalence was given to the highly conjectural numbers of the latter.'2 We have to conclude that the authority of a subject, like its shape, is as much a result of idiosyncratic historical developments. True, the persistence of the atomists paid off: modern elementary particle physics, quantum chemistry, and molecular biology would not exist without it. But these achievements could not be foreseen, and an appeal to un- known and as yet inconceivable future effects can also be applied to the gods. Thus, the modified separability assumption cannot help us to get rid of gods either: having decided to separate history and existence, we must separate the existence of the gods even from the most "advanced" scientific argument. Result: neither the separability assumption nor the modified se- parability assumption can make us accept atoms but deny gods. A realism that separates being and history and yet assumes that being can be grasped by history is forced to populate being with all the creatures that have been considered and are still being considered by scientists, prophets, and others. To avoid this abundance, some phil- osophers and scientists made the following move: Scientific entities " Cyril Stanley Smith [A Search for Structure (Cambridge: MIT, 1981)] distin- guishes between theories of matter such as the atomic theory and a knowledge of materials. He describes how the latter arose millenia before the former, was more detailed, and was frequently impeded by theoretical considerations. In an exhibition [items presented and explained in From Art to Science (Cambridge: MIT, 1980)] he showed the enormous amount of information contained in the products of early artisans. Norma Emerton [The Scientific Reinterpretation of Form (Ithaca: Cor- nell, 1984)] describes the battle between form theories (which were fairly close to the practice of the crafts) and atomism (which was not) and comments on the methods the atomists used to remain on top. 12J. D. Burchfield, Lord Kelvin and the Age of the Earth (New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 1975).</page><page sequence="8">400 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY (and, for that matter, all entities), they said, are projections and thus tied to the theory, the ideology, and the culture that postulates and projects them. The assertion that some things are independent of research, or history, belongs to special projecting mechanisms that "objectivize" their ontology; it makes no sense outside the historical stage that contains the mechanisms.'3 Abundance occurs in history, it does not occur in the world. But not all projections are successful. The "scientific entities" mentioned above are not simply dreams; they are inventions that went through long periods of adaptation, correction, and modifica- tion, and then allowed scientists to produce previously unknown effects. Similarly, the gods of antiquity and the triune God of Chris- tianity who replaced them were not just poetic visions. They also had effects. They influenced the lives of individuals, groups, and entire nations. Gods and atoms may have started as "projections"-but they received a response, which means they apparently succeeded in bridging the gulf that naive realists had erected between being and their own historical existence. Why has this response disappeared in the case of (the) gods? Why is it so powerful in the case of matter? III. THE POWER OF SCIENCE What I have said so far is simple and straightforward. Even a well- constructed argument cannot remove the overwhelming impression, however, that anthropomorphic gods were killed by the arrival, first, of philosophical and, then, of scientific rationalism. I shall therefore approach the matter again, and from a slightly different angle. Gods -and this now means the Homeric gods as well as the omnipotent creator-god of Christianity-are not only moral, but also physical powers. They cause thunderstorms, earthquakes, and floods; they break the laws of nature to produce miracles; they raise the sea and stop the sun in its course. But such events are now either denied or accounted for by physical causes, and remaining lacunae are being swiftly closed by research. Thus projecting the theoretical entities of science, we remove gods from their position of power and, as the more fundamental scientific entities obey time-independent laws, show that they never existed. Many religious people have accepted this argument and diluted their creed until it agreed with this phil- osophy. Now, the fact that science dominates certain areas of knowledge does not by itself eliminate alternative ideas. Neurophysiology pro- vides detailed models for mental processes; yet the mind-body prob- 13 Fine has shown that this was also the way in which Einstein understood his own "realism" (op. cit., ch. 6).</page><page sequence="9">REALISM AND THE HISTORICITY OF KNOWLEDGE 401 lem is being kept alive, both by scientists and scientifically inclined philosophers. Some scientists even demand that we "put[ ] mind and consciousness in the driver's seat,"'14 i.e., that we return to them the power they had before the rise of a materialistic psychology. These scientists oppose the elimination and/or reduction of pre- scientific psychological ideas and entities. There is no reason why gods whose numinous aspects always resisted reduction should be treated differently. Secondly, a reference to basic time-independent laws works only if the modern accounts of divinely caused events such as thunder- storms, earthquakes, vulcanic eruptions, etc., can be reduced to them. But there exist no acceptable reductions of the required kind. Special fields introduce special models whose derivability from basic physics is assumed, not shown. Already Descartes was aware of this situation. Commenting on the richness of the world, he professed himself unable to reduce the properties of special processes such as light to his own basic principles and used a variety of "hypotheses" instead.'5 Newton's'6 discussion of the properties of motion in re- sisting media abandons the deductive style of his planetary astron- omy. It is "almost entirely original and much of it is false. New hypotheses start up at every block; concealed assumptions are em- ployed freely and the stated assumptions sometimes are not used at all."''7 Modern researchers in the area explicitly reject reductive de- mands: "It is as ridiculous to deride continuum physics because it is not obtained from nuclear physics as it would be to reproach it with lack of foundation in the Bible."'8 The general theory of relativity for a long time was connected with the known planetary laws by conjec- ture, not by derivation (calculating the path of Mercury, one added the Schwarzschild solution to the results of prerelativistic perturba- tion theory without having shown from basic principles that both adequately described the situation in the planetary system). The connection between quantum mechanics and the classical level is quite obscure and has only recently been dealt with in a more satis- factory manner.'9 Meteorology, geology, psychology, large parts of 14 R.

The book also contains a detailed discussion of the relation between chemistry and basic physics.</page><page sequence="10">402 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY biology, and social studies are even further removed from unifica- tion. Thus, instead of a multitude of particulars firmly tied to a set of time-invariant basic laws, we have a variety of approaches with uni- fying principles looming indistinctly in the background-a situation quite similar to what happened in Greece after Zeus's victory over the Titans.20 Thirdly, we are far from possessing a single consistent set of fun- damental laws. Basic physics, the alleged root of all reductions, is still divided into at least two principal domains: the world of the very large, tamed by Einstein's general relativity, and the quantum world which itself is not yet completely united. "Nature likes to be com- partmentalised," wrote Dyson describing this situation.2' "Subjec- tive" elements such as feelings and sensations which form a further "compartment" are excluded from the natural sciences, though they play a role in their acquisition and control. This means that the (unsolved) mind-body problem affects the very foundation of scien- tific research. Science has large lacunae; its alleged unity and com- prehensiveness is not a fact but a (metaphysical) assumption, and those of its projections which work come from isolated areas and thus lack the destructive power ascribed to them. They show how certain sections of the world respond to crude approaches; they give us no clue about the structure of the world as a whole. Finally, as the most fundamental and most highly confirmed theory of present day physics, the quantum theory rejects uncondi- tional projections and makes existence depend on special historically determined circumstances. Molecules, for example, the basic entities of chemistry and molecular biology, do not simply exist-period- they appear only under well-defined and rather complex conditions. If one still insists that the bits and pieces of science that are flying around today are superior by far to the analogous collections of a past age-a live nature, whimsical gods, etc.-then I must refer back to what I said earlier: the superiority is the result of having followed a path of least resistance. Gods cannot be captured by experiment, matter can. This point, incidentally, plays a role also 2o Hesiod, Theogony, 820ff. 21 Disturbing the Universe (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1979), p. 63. Superstring theoreticians try to overcome the remaining multiplicity, but all they have so far succeeded in doing is devising a language in which they can talk about everything without ever arriving at any concrete results. In the words of Richard Feynman: "I do feel strongly that this is nonsense" [P. C. W. Davies and J. Brown, eds., Su- perstrings (New York: Cambridge, 1988), p. 194]. Besides, even if superstring theoreticians succeeded in uniting basic physics, they would still have to deal with chemistry, biology, consciousness, etc.</page><page sequence="11">REALISM AND THE HISTORICITY OF KNOWLEDGE 403 within the sciences. "The great success of Cartesian method and the Cartesian view of nature," write R. Levins and R. C. Lewontin22 commenting on the significance of the recent advances in molecular biology, is in part a result of a historical path of least resistance. Those problems that yield to the attack are pursued most vigorously, precisely because the method works there. Other problems and other phenomena are left behind, walled off from understanding by the commitment to Carte- sianism. The harder problems are not tackled, if for no other reason than that brilliant scientific careers are not built on persistent failure. So the problems of understanding embryonic and psychic development and the structure and function of the central nervous system remain in much the same unsatisfactory state they were fifty years ago, while molecular biologists go from triumph to triumph in describing and manipulating genes (ibid., pp. 2f.). E. Chargaff23 writes as follows: The insufficiency of all biological experimentation, when confronted with the vastness of life is often considered to be redeemed by recourse to a firm methodology. But definite procedures presuppose highly lim- ited objects (ibid., p. 170). The insufficiency of science vis-a-vis the gods could not be expressed more clearly. IV. DOGMATISM, INSTRUMENTALISM, RELATIVISM There exist various ways of dealing with this situation. One is to disregard it and to continue describing the world in accordance with one's own pet metaphysics. This is the attitude of most scientists and scientific philosophers. It is a sensible attitude; it was the attitude of the educated Greeks and Romans who retained their gods amidst a flurry of philosophical objections. It does not solve our problem. Instrumentalists react by dropping the second assumption. They do not drop it absolutely ("nothing exists"), however, but only with respect to certain entities.24 A confrontation with alternative ontolo- gies revives the problem. Relativists accept the first assumption but relativize the second: atoms exist given the conceptual framework that projects them. The trouble here is that traditions not only have no well-defined bound- 22 The Dialectical Biologist (Cambridge: MIT, 1985). 23 Heraclitean Fire (New York: Rockefeller UP, 1978). 24 This was realized by Duhem, who described a certain stage of the debate between realism and instrumentalism in astronomy as a battle "between two realist positions." To Save the Phenomena (Chicago: University Press, 1969), p. 106.</page><page sequence="12">404 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY aries, but contain ambiguities and methods of change which enable their members to think and act as if no boundaries existed: poten- tially every tradition is all traditions. Relativizing existence to a single "conceptual system" that is then closed off from the rest and pre- sented in unambiguous detail mutilates real traditions and creates a chimera.25 Paradoxically this is done by people who pride themselves of their tolerance toward all ways of life. Relativists are right, however, when asserting that the temptation to project certain entities (gods, atoms) increases in some circum- stances, and is diminished in others. Given the auspicious circum- stances, the entities do indeed "appear" in a clear and decisive way. More recent developments in the interpretation of quantum me- chanics suggest to regard such appearances as phenomena (Bohr's term) that transcend the dichotomy subjective/objective (which un- derlies the second assumption). They are "subjective," for they could not exist without the idiosyncratic conceptual and perceptual guid- ance of some point of view (which need not be available in explicit form); but they are also "objective": not all ways of thinking have results and not all perceptions are trustworthy. New terminology is needed to adapt our problem to this situation. V. HUMANS AS SCULPTORS OF REALITY According to the first assumption, our ways of thinking and speaking are products of idiosyncratic historical developments. Commonsense and science both conceal this situation. For example, they say (sec- ond assumption) that atoms existed long before they were found. This explains why the projection received a response, but overlooks that vastly different projections did not remain unanswered. A better way of telling the story is the following. Scientists, being equipped with a complex organism and embedded in constantly changing physical and social surroundings, used ideas and actions (and, much later, equipment up to and including industrial com- plexes such as CERN) to manufacture, first, metaphysical atoms, then, crude physical atoms, and, finally, complex systems of elemen- tary particles out of a material that did not contain these elements but could be shaped into them. Scientists, according to this account, are sculptors of reality-but sculptors in a special sense. They not merely act causally upon the world (though they do that, too, and they have to if they want to "discover" new entities); they also create semantic conditions engendering strong inferences from known ef- fects to novel projections and, conversely, from the projections to 25 I have described this aspect of relativism in ch. 10 of my book Farewell to Reason (London: Verso, 1987).</page><page sequence="13">REALISM AND THE HISTORICITY OF KNOWLEDGE 405 testable effects. We have here the same dichotomy of descriptions which Bohr introduced in his analysis of the case of Einstein, Po- dolsky, and Rosen.26 Every individual, group, and culture tries to arrive at an equilibrium between the entities it posits and leading beliefs, needs, expectations, and ways of arguing. The separability assumption arises in special cases (traditions, cultures); it is not a condition (to be) satisfied by all and it certainly is not a sound basis for epistemology. Altogether, the dichotomy subjective/objective and the corresponding dichotomy between descriptions and con- structions is much too naive to guide our ideas about the nature and the implications of knowledge claims. I do not assert that any combined causal-semantic action will lead to a well-articulated and livable world. The material humans (and, for that matter, also dogs and monkeys) face must be approached in the right way. It offers resistance; some constructions (some incipient cultures-cargo cults, for example) find no point of attack in it and simply collapse. On the other hand, this material is more pliable than is commonly assumed. Molding it in one way (history of tech- nology leading up to a technologically streamlined environment and large research cities such as CERN), we get elementary particles; proceeding in another, we get a nature that is alive and full of gods. Even the "discovery" of America which I used to support the sepa- rability assumption allowed some leeway, as is shown by Edmondo O'Gorman's fascinating study, The Invention of America.27 Science certainly is not the only source of reliable ontological information. It is important to read these statements in the right way. They are not the sketch of a new theory of knowledge which explains the relation between humans and the world and provides a philosophical grounding for whatever discoveries are being made. Taking the his- torical character of knowledge seriously means rejecting any such attempt. We can describe the results we have obtained (though the description will always be fatally incomplete), we can comment on some similarities and differences that have come to our attention, and we can even try to explain what we found in the course of a 26 Cf. the reprint in J. A. Wheeler and W. H. Zurek, eds., Quantum Theory and Measurement (Princeton: University Press, 1983), p. 42. The present essay is firmly based on Bohr's ideas. Reading the epilogue of Paul Hoyningen's Die Wissen- schaftsphilosophie Thomas Kuhns (Braunschweig: Vieweg, 1989), 1 also realize that its ideas are very similar to, and almost identical with, Kuhn's as yet unpub- lished, later philosophy. I asked Hoyningen how he would explain this pre-estab- lished harmony (when writing my paper I was not familiar with Kuhn's later philoso- phy). His answer-"Reasonable people think along the same lines"-seems entirely acceptable. 27 Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1961.</page><page sequence="14">406 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY particular approach "from the inside," i.e., using the practical and conceptual means provided by the approach (the theory of evolu- tion, evolutionary epistemology, and modern cosmology belong in this category). We can tell many interesting stories. We cannot ex- plain, however, how the chosen approach is related to the world and why it is successful, in terms of the world. This would mean knowing the results of all possible approaches or, what amounts to the same, we would know the history of the world before the world has come to an end. And yet we cannot do without scientific know-how. Our world has been transformed by the material, spiritual, and intellectual impact of science and science-based technologies. Its reaction to the trans- formation (and a strange reaction it is!) is that we are stuck in a scientific environment. We need scientists, engineers, scientifically inclined philosophers, sociologists, etc., to deal with the conse- quences. My point is that these consequences are not grounded in an "objective" nature, but come from a complicated interplay between an unknown and relatively pliable material and researchers who af- fect and are affected and changed by the material which, after all, is the material from which they have been shaped. It is not therefore easier to remove the results. The "subjective" side of knowledge, being inextricably intertwined with its material manifestations, can- not be just blown away. Far from merely stating what is already there, it created conditions of existence, a world corresponding to these conditions and a life that is adapted to this world; all three now support or "establish" the conjectures that led to them. Still, a look at history shows that this world is not a static world populated by thinking (and publishing) ants who, crawling all over its crevices, gradually discover its features without affecting them in any way. It is a dynamical and multifaceted being which influences and reflects the activity of its explorers. It was once full of gods; it then became a drab material world; and it can be changed again, if its inhabitants have the determination, the intelligence, and the heart to take the necessary steps.
