<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARLY HISTORY OF GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND A Contribution to the Etiology of the Disease ISIDOR GREENWALD * The success of the use of iodides in the prophylaxis of endemic goiter has tended to obscure, in the minds of many, the numerous observations that indicate that lack of iodine is not the sole cause of goiter. Of these, only those that are germane to the subject of the present paper will be considered. There are many others.1 Nor will any attempt be made here to discuss the validity of the claim that the incidence of goiter in a popu- lation is in inverse relation to the concentration of iodine in the food or water or both. It may be well to recall that Marine, whose investigations were chiefly responsible for the recent revival of the prophylactic use of iodine, did not claim that lack of iodine was the sole cause of goiter. Marine and Lenhart (3) wrote (p. 479) : But whatever the ultimate causal factor is shown to be, it is certain that there is a deficiency of iodin in the gland, and that this deficiency of iodin in the gland is not usually due to a lack of iodin intake, but is dependent on a lack of absorption or assimilation of iodin. And it is our belief that one or more chemical substances will be found which are antagonistic to or inhibit the normal absorption or assimilation of iodin. The present paper is a review of the evidence relating to the early history of goiter in the Americas, in New Zealand, and in England. It will be shown that there is no evidence that goiter existed in the Americas,2' 3 or in New Zealand before the coming of the white men, and ♦From the Department of Chemistry, New York University College of Medicine. 1 The earlier literature is reviewed by Hirsch (1). Some of the more recent reports are to be found in the Proceedings of the Second International Goiter Congressi Berne, 1933. A later review is given by Wolter (2). 2 In his monograph, Stone (4) states (p. 26) : " In certain areas, goiters and urinary calculi were endemic as they are today in these regions among both their white and red inhabitants." Inquiry as to the sources for this statement elicited the reply : " Goiter was not noticed by the early-day explorers or pioneers" (5). 8 In his book, Moll (6) (p. 504), says of goiter: "Prevalent in America since pre- Columbian days, as Valdizan pointed out for Peru and shown by Tarascan figures in Mexico"; A request for specific reference to the statement by Valdizan, who published between 1922 and 1925, and to where Tarascan figures showing goiter may be found met with no reply to the first, and with the statement - "Tarascan figures (showing goiter? 229</page><page sequence="2">230 ISIDOR GREENWALD in most regions, for many years thereafter. Many other diseases were observed and reported by early explorers and travellers. The fact that goiter, so easily observed, particularly among those who did not cover the neck, was not reported by any of them must be regarded as evidence that it did not exist. In addition, certain definite statements as to its absence are also to be found. It will also be shown that, at various times, goiter became extremely prevalent and marked in districts in which it later became comparatively rare.4 Many of the sites of its originally high incidence are quite close to the sea, both horizontally and vertically. It will be shown that there is definite evidence that goiter was unknown in England about 1600, that the earliest clear indication of its existence in England dates from 1743 and that writers of an earlier period referred to the disorder exclusively as a remarkable condition prevalent in Switzer- land, Piedmont, and Styria. The significance of these facts will be discussed briefly. America, North of Mexico The earliest paper by a physician dealing with diseases of the Indians appears to be that by Benjamin Rush in 1774 (8). In that, there is no mention of goiter. This disorder is first described as occurring among Indians by Barton (9). 5 This he observed among the Oneida Indians in western New York in 1797 and shortly thereafter in the Ohio Valley and along the shores of Lake Erie. Barton mentions others who had seen goiters (amongst whites, not Indians) in various parts of North America. Most interesting, in view of later conditions, is the report of the pre- valence of goiter among the whites in the Mohawk Valley. This had I. G.) are to be found in Mexican museums. Dr. Leon, the well-known medical historian, had a number of them in his collection, unfortunately scattered after his death. I realize only too well that in every interpretation of signs in such figures, as well as in huacos, full allowance must be made for the interpreter's possible bias or eagerness to find confirmatory results, and also for the factor of human fallability, which on such shaky ground (italics, I. G.) may tilt decisively the scales in the wrong direction" (7). The evidence regarding the occurrence of goiter in Mexico and in Peru will be considered in the appropriate sections of this paper. 4 Only some of those changes that occurred in the Americas will be considered. There were many other similar changes in Europe, as described in Hirsch (1) and by others, see Wolter (2). 6 Considerable space will be devoted to a consideration of Barton's statements because they have been quoted by many subsequent writers, even so recently as 1933, by Har- ington (10). It will be shown that some of them are based upon the untrustworthy or erroneous reports of others.</page><page sequence="3">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 231 been observed by Coventry (11) in 1792, particularly among those of German or Swiss descent. The date at which Barton first saw goiter amongst Indians is nearly two hundred years after the coming of white men. During that time, many explorers, missionaries and other pioneers had visited the Great Lakes section of North America, had spent considerable time living with the Indians, and had written descriptions of their physical characteristics, of their mode of life, of their diseases, and of their methods of treating these. The present writer makes no pretense to having read all of these reports. He has, however, examined a large number of them, has con- sulted the indices of all publications available that have been indexed, and has searched, page by page, the relevant portions of many other accounts that are provided only with a table of contents. Of these, only the more important, containing the more significant material, will be mentioned here. The Champlain Society of Toronto has published or, rather, repub- lished, in the original and in English translation, the journals and writings of several of the early explorers of the St. Lawrence Valley, the Great Lakes and the regions west of these. Among the more important of these, for our present purpose, is the Long Journey to the Country of the Hurons by Sagard-Theodat (12). He spent the winter of 1623-4 with the Hurons. In his account there are seventeen chapters, 126 pages, dealing with their physical characteristics and their mode of life from birth to burial. There is no mention of goiter. The Huron Indians lived in the peninsula of Ontario, now a well-known goiter district. One of the lieutenants of La Salle, Hennepin, left a detailed account of his explorations. He ascended the Mississippi from the mouth of the Ohio to the falls of St. Anthony in Minnesota. He came to Canada in 1675 and returned to France in 1682. His New Discovery contains more than eighty pages descriptive of the Indians, describing their customs of adoption, feasting, games, their remedies, etc.; but there is no mention of goiter. He wrote (13) (p. 477) : " They are clear-limb'd, active and robust. I never saw any blind, crooked or deformed person among them." and (14) (p. 144), " The fact that the Indians are without bodily defects. . . ." The great source of information regarding the early days of Canada is The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents . These contain the annual reports of the Jesuit missionaries to the Provincial of the Order in France.</page><page sequence="4">232 ISIDOR GREENWALD They have been edited by Reuben Gold Thwaites (15) and published, in the original French or Italian, with English translations, in 69 volumes and two volumes of indices. The latter contain hundreds of references to the life of the Indians from the Atlantic to Lake Superior and the Mississippi River and south to western New York. There is but one reference to goiter. That occurs in the Breve Relatione of Bressionis of 1653. Writing of the Hurons, he states (Vol. 38, p. 257) : They are not very dark, especially in their youth ; they are strong, tall in stature, and well-proportioned; more healthy than we, not even knowing the names of many diseases common in Europe such as the stone, gout, rupture, etc. They are not found either hunch-backed nor dwarfed or very corpulent, or with goiter. There are five references to scrofula in these accounts. They are really scrofula, not goiter, for everyone mentions the discharge and the foul odor. Aside from these Jesuit Relations, there are many other published accounts giving in considerable detail information regarding the Indians from the Great Lakes to the Rocky Mountains. The information regard- ing the Indians of the western Great Lakes contained in these accounts has been incorporated by Kinietz (16) in his book. There is no mention of goiter in this volume nor in the original sources that have been examined. Of the Indians living further to the west, on the upper Missouri, we have the testimony of Perrin du Lac (17), page 79: The savages are, in general, tall, and well made. . . . Dropsies, apoplexies, palsies, gout, asthma, consumption, stone, etc. are unknown. That this early freedom from goiter was not due to any racial immunity of the Indians is evident from the fact that in 1895, nearly all the Indian agency physicians reported to Munson (18) that the disease was more frequent among full-blooded Indians than among whites or among half-breeds. Shortly after the purchase of Louisiana, Jefferson commissioned Capt. Meriwether Lewis to explore some of this new possession of the United States. In his instructions to Capt. Lewis, Jefferson enjoined him to record the names, number and characteristics of the Indian tribes, includ- ing " the diseases prevalent among them and the remedies they use " (19) (Vol. 7, p. 248). Several members of the expedition kept diaries. In the J ournal of Capt. Lewis, we may read (20) (p. 44) : . was here (Ohio River, a short distance below Marietta, I. G.) informed that there were some instances of the goitre in the neighborhood two women who</page><page sequence="5">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 233 lived on the bank of the river just below they had emegrated to that place from the lower part of Pennsylvania and had contracted the disease since there residence on the Ohio. This passage is quoted only to show that at least the leader of the expedition recognized goiter and believed it to be of sufficient importance to mention it in his diary, even in that part concerned with his voyage through territory belonging to the United States since 1783. There are references to other diseases, mostly venereal, in these diaries,. but there is no other reference to goiter in any of them (19) (20) (21). There is one reference to tumors (19) (Vol. 3, p. 186). The nativs of the waters of the Columbia appear helthy. Some have turners on different parts of their bodies. At the time of the Lewis and Clark expedition, Tabeau was living among the Arikara Indians on the upper Missouri River. He left us a rather detailed description of the various tribes, of their physical charac- teristics, mode of life, etc. Of the climate of the upper Missouri, he wrote (22), page 151: ... if the winter were a little less rigorous, (the climate, I. G.) would be, methinks, one of most beautiful in the world. . . . Consequently, inflammation of the lungs, ague, jaundice and other maladies are here absolutely unknown. Strangers, like the natives of this region, enjoy perfect health and I believe that, were it not for accidental illnesses and especially the venereal diseases, one would be ill only to die. The territories to the east and to the south of those explored by Lewis and Clark were visited by Major Z. M. Pike. His first expedition to the headwaters of the Mississippi was made in 1805 and 1806; his second to the west and southwest and into Mexico in 1807. There is no mention of goiter in his journals of these expeditions (23). A few years later, there was another exploration of the southwest under the command of Major S. H. Long. The route was up the Platte River to the Rocky Mountains, returning by the Arkansas River. This journey did not pass through what is now recognized as a region of very high incidence of goiter. Nevertheless, in 1895, Munson (18) reported an incidence of 20 per 1000 among the Santee Sioux in northwestern Nebraska and of 30 per 1000 among the Utes in southern Colorado, and in 1908, Hrdlička (24) reported 3 cases in 300 children at the* Genoa school, near the Platte River, in eastern Nebraska. It is, therefore, interesting to read in the account of the Long expedition by the botanist and geologist thereof (25) (Vol. 1, p. 239) : Goitures and wens are not known [among the Omaha Indians I. G.]. 2-</page><page sequence="6">234 ISIDOR GREENWALD A few years later, there was a similar expedition to the north through much the same country as that visited by Pike on his first expedition eighteen years earlier. Keating (26) mentioned a number of diseases that were observed among the Indians. Goiter was not among them. Belonging to the same period, is the account by Schoolcraft (27) of his voyage from Detroit to the headwaters of the Mississippl. He devoted considerable space to an account of the various Indian tribes, but there does not appear to be any mention of goiter. Beltrami (28) (29) was another visitor to the sources of the Missis- sippl. He also described the physical characteristics of the Indians, but did not mention seeing any goiters. In addition to these reports, we have a series of Early Western Travels , 1749-1846 , edited by R. G. Thwaites and published in thirty volumes and two volumes of indices (30). Under the entry " diseases," there are about 325 references. Under the word " tumor " we find a reference to a description of what was unquestionably goiter, observed near Pittsburgh in 1803 (Vol. 3, p. 346). There is one reference to goiter. That occurs in the Travels into the Interior of North America by Maximilian of Wied (1832-4). Writing of the Mandan Indians, he states (Vol. 23, p. 257) : . . . some goiters, or rather thick necks, among the women are caused by too great exertion in carrying burdens on their backs. Whether the " thick necks " were goiters or not we cannot say, but the time was a hundred years after the country had first been visited by Pierre de la Verendrye (31). In the interval, many other white men had come and gone, and there had been many changes in the life of the Indians. David Thompson (32, 33), who had a keen eye for natural phenomena, spent twelve days among the Mandans in 1798 and did not record the presence of goiter or of thick necks. Moreover, we have the positive statements of Perrin du Lac (17) and of Tabeau (22) that the Indians were of good physique in 1803. In this collection of Early Western Travels , there is but one reference to scrofula (Vol. 16, p. 132) and then it is mentioned merely as a disease that may be expected " if ever Western Louisiana is peopled." For eight years, 1832-39, George Catlin (34) lived among the Indians in various parts of the United States; for much of that time in districts in which goiter is, or recently was, endemic. His purpose was to depict the Indians and their customs not only in words, but by drawing and painting. The Oneida Indians (see page 230) are mentioned, but were</page><page sequence="7">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 235 not visited because their mode of life had been too greatly influenced by their prolonged contact with white men. He spent considerable time with the Mandan Indians and devoted more than a hundred large pages to a description of their physique, their mode of life and their beliefs. Neither in these hundred pages nor in any other part of the two volumes is there any reference to goiter. In this period (1820), we find a reference to the occurrence of goiter in western North America which has repeatedly been cited as evidence of the worldwide distribution of goiter. This occurs in Sir John Franklin's Narrative of a Voyage to the Shores of the Polar Sea (35), p. 118. The following remarks on a well-known disease are extracted from Dr. Richard- son's journal. " Bronchocele or goiter is a common disease at Edmonton. I examined several . . . endeavored to obtain information regarding it from the most authentic sources. . . . The disorder attacks only those who drink the water of the river. It is indeed in its worst state, confined almost entirely to the half-breed women and children who reside constantly at the fort and make use of river water. . . . The men ... on journeys . . . when their drink is melted snow are less affected; and, if any exhibit during the winter some incipient signs of the complaint, the annual summer voyage to the seacoast generally effects a cure. The natives who confine themselves to snow water in the winter and drink of the small rivulets which flow through the plains in summer, are exempt from the attacks of the disease. . . . A residence of a single year at Edmonton is sufficient to render a family bronchocelous. Many of the goiters acquire a great size. Burnt sponge has been tried and found to remove the disease, but an exposure to the same cause imme- diately reproduces it. A great portion of the children of the women who have goiter are born idiots with large heads and the other distinguishing mark of cretins." The disease was reported to Richardson as also existing on the head waters of the Peace and Elk (now Athabasca) Rivers, northwest of Edmonton. It is explicitly stated (p. 119) that the disease was not known at Carlton House, about 300 miles to the east, down the North Saskatchewan, from Edmonton, although river water was used. This was an observation that Richardson made himself, for he spent considerable time there. This very explicit account of the occurrence of goiter and cretinism is interesting because of its geographic and temporal isolation. There is no record of goiter at that time within at least a thousand miles of Edmonton. The fort, as the trading posts were known, was built in 1794 or 1795 (36), some 20 miles down the river from the site of Edmonton. This was destroyed by the Indians in 1807 and rebuilt in 1808 on the present site of Edmonton. The earliest visit of a white man to the Saskatchewan</page><page sequence="8">236 ISIDOR GREENWALD in the immediate vicinity was probably that of Peter Pangman in 1789 (37), but he left no records. In 1754, Anthony Hendry had probably come within about 150 miles of Edmonton (38). There is no mention of goiter in his journal. David Thompson and Alexander Henry (32) (33) visited the vicinity of Edmonton at various times between 1799 and 1809. Neither mentioned goiter among the Indians. Alexander Mackenzie (39) travelled extensively in the section watered by the Athabasca and Peace Rivers after 1787 ; and in 1792-3, he crossed the Rocky Mountains from the headwaters of the Peace River to those of the Fraser. He mentioned a Mr. Pond (Vol. 1, p. 349), who settled on the bank of the Athabasca River in 1787 and remained there three years ; but nowhere in his book is there any mention of goiter. David Harmon (40) travelled a great deal in the same region between 1800 and 1810, traversing it again in 1819, after having spent the inter- vening years on the west side of the Rocky Mountains. There is no mention of goiter in his Journal nor in the sixty-eight pages devoted to an " Account of the Indians on the East Side of the Rocky Mountains." The account given by Franklin is, therefore, the earliest report of the existence of goiter in this region. Thereafter, it was reported regularly, in a territory of ever-increasing size, but apparently in lesser severity. In 1841, Sir George Simpson (41), head of the Hudson's Bay Com- pany, travelled along the Saskatchewan River. While on the Bow or South Saskatchewan River, but apparently referring to both branches of the Saskatchewan, he wrote (Vol. 1, p. 118) : ... the water, like that of the Alps, was known to give the goitre, even as far down as the forks of the two great branches of the Saskatchewan, to such as might habitually and permanently use it. It is interesting to note that Simpson states that the disease prevailed as far east as the forks of the Saskatchewan. This is well below Carlton House, where, according to Richardson, it was absent in 1819. A few years after George Simpson, P. J. de Smet (42) passed through Edmonton on his way to the Pacific coast. At Edmonton, he wrote (p. 183): In this climate, wens are not infrequent. It is noteworthy that although de Smet travelled over great areas in the northwestern United States and western Canada, this is the only reference to the occurrence of goiter. There was a very thorough exploration of the district from 1857 to</page><page sequence="9">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 237 1860 under the command of Capt. Palliser. The geologist was James Hector, a physician. At Edmonton, under date of February 6, 1858, he wrote (43) (p. 78) : Goitre is very prevalent among the residents here and at the Rocky Mountain House, (100 miles southwest, I. G.), but in a modified form, and I have seen only one case in which there is any approach to cretinism. I tabulated the details of 50 or 60 cases, but have not discovered any one condition or habit of life that is common to all that suffer from the complaint. The only curious feature seems to be that children born at one fort are never attacked till removed to the other, and it again disappears on their return to their native place. This efifect of removal from one place to another, each site being goitrogenic for children born at the other, appears to be unique in reports concerning goiter. For this observation, Hector was, in all probability, dependent upon others. However, our immediate interest is in an obser- vation that was his own, viz. : the rarity of cretinism. When his is com- pared with Richardson's account, it is apparent that there had been a marked change in forty years. Shortly after the Palliser expedition had completed its explorations, Viscount Milton and W. B. Cheadle travelled across Canada. They may truly be said to have been the first tourists to visit the prairie provinces and the Canadian Rockies. Their experiences are recounted in the book they wrote (44) and in the journal kept by Cheadle (45). They spent the winter of 1862-3 near Carlton House, which they reached on September 28. Under date of October 8, Cheadle wrote : Goitre frequent amongst dwellers on banks of Saskatchewan: limestone and carbonate of lime plentiful. They were at Edmonton from May 14th to June 3. Cheadle' s journal contains no further references to goiter, but in their joint book, Milton and Cheadle wrote, of the girls of Edmonton (44), p. 69: . . . some of the young girls were good looking, but many of them were disfigured by goitre, which is very prevalent among the half breeds at all posts on the Saskatchewan, although unknown among the Indians. From Edmonton, they proceeded to the headwaters of the Athabasca River and crossed the Rockies to the Fraser River. They made no mention of goiter on the Athabasca River, as reported by Richardson forty years earlier. That goiter was not particularly prevalent among the Indians may also be concluded from the observations of Paul Kane. He attempted for the Indians of Canada what Catlin tried to do for those of the' United</page><page sequence="10">238 ISIDOR GREENWALD States, viz., to prepare a record, in. word and picture, of their physical characteristic and mode of life. He was in and around Edmonton on three occasions in 1846, 1847 and 1848. He mentions the beauty of some of the Indian women, but neither in his book (46) nor in the pictures that have been published (47), has any indication of the existence of goiter been found. Cheadle's is the latest reference to goiter in Alberta for a long time. In 1919, there was a considerable discussion of the prevalence of the disease in the vicinity of Calgary (48) and later surveys (49) (50) (51) indicate that the disease is now fairly widespread not only in Alberta, but in Saskatchewan and Manitoba (52) (53) as well. However, in 1919, T. H. Whitelaw (54), after a residence of nineteen years in Edmonton, the first ten years in general practice, later as medical officer, wrote : I am personally acquainted with a great many " old timers " and their families who were here when I came here nineteen years ago, and I cannot say that I recollect seeing a single case among them. It is, therefore, evident that the history of goiter in and about Edmon- ton resembles that of newly introduced epidemic diseases, which, after a period of high incidence and great severity become endemic, but with lowered incidence and lessened severity with occasional increases in both. In marked contrast to the conditions reported by Hector, a member of Palliser's party exploring a route for a Canadian Pacific railroad, are those reported by Suckley, a physician attached to a party exploring a route for a Pacific railroad through the northern United States, at about the same time. No mention of goiter has been found in Suckley's report, which includes the following paragraphs regarding the diseases of the Indians (55), page 124: All the Indian tribes which came under my observation east of the Rocky Mountains seemed free from epidemic disease, at least temporarily free. Their principal complaints are chronic inflammation of eye and phthisis pulmonalis. Lues venerea and gonorrhea prevail, to a certain extent among the Assiniboines and Gros Ventres; but the Blackfoot proper, Piegans and Blood Indians, as far as I could learn, are nearly exempt from these diseases. The Indians seen between the Rocky Mountains and Fort Col ville belong to the Flathead and Pend ďOreille or Kalispelm tribes. Owing to the good principles inculcated by the missionaries, they are very virtuous in their habits : consequently, syphilis is almost unknown among them. Phthisis pulmonalis is very common among them, especially among the last-mentioned tribes. They are very poor and frequently suffer from scanty innutritious diet. As most of the members of both of these tribes have been vaccinated by the missionaries, small pox is of rare occurrence.</page><page sequence="11">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 239 It is scarcely conceivable that goiter, if endemic at that time, would not have been reported by Suckley. Today, the region traversed by the expedition and inhabited by the Indian tribes mentioned is included in the great goiter areas of the United States. The various surveys, explorations and accounts of travellers in the more southerly portions of the western United States fail to disclose any mention of goiter to at least as late as 1860. In the following year, Burton wrote, of the inhabitants of Utah (56), page 337 : It is also remarkable that though all drink snow water, and though many live in valleys where there is no free circulation of air, goitre and cretinism are not yet named. Returning to the eastern United States, we find that the presence of goiter in the first decade of the nineteenth century is evidenced not only by Barton, but by others. In 1804, Timothy Dwight, President of Yale College (57) wrote of a journey made by United States Senator Uriah Tracy. Beginning in 1800: 6 ... he passed through Pennsylvania by the way of Pittsburgh and Presque Isle and thence crossing Lake Erie, proceeded to Detroit. From this place, he went to Michilimackinac and thence to Lake Superior. From Michilimackinac, he returned to Buffaloe creak, and took the great western road to Albany. In this excursion, he found the goitre existing in the older settlements more, and in the newer, less frequently, but actually existing at different distances throughout the whole region. Several other gentlemen have confirmed the account of Mr. Tracy. That the disease exists from Utica to Buffaloe, is, I think, certain; probably not in every township ; but in such a manner as to indicate that it is incident to the country at large, and has a foundation in its nature and circumstances. (Vol. 4, p. 116) Dwight, himself, saw several cases of goiter in the Mohawk Valley. The prevalence of the disease is attested to not only by Barton and by Dwight, but also by Coventry (8), later president of the Medical Society of the State of New York. The latter saw several cases near Utica in 1792. In 1798, he settled near a goiter family. A few months later, his wife and daughters developed goiters ; a year or two later, a twelve-year old boy living nearby developed the disease, and, in 1802, a flock of sheep became goitrous. After discontinuing the use of the brook that ran by the property of the goiter family and after this family moved away, Coventry's family and sheep had no further trouble. However, the relief was much more general, for in 1824 he wrote of Utica: ... if there is a single case of goitre among the population of 4,000 souls, it is unknown to me. 6 The date is not given by Dwight, but has been obtained from Gibbs (58).</page><page sequence="12">240 ISIDOR GREENWALD The same testimony is given by John W. Francis, who visited the region in 1823. In a letter to Hosack (59) he wrote: However frequent cases of goiter may formerly have been in the State of New York, the fact is certain that they are much less frequent at the present time. . . . In the village of Utica, which contains between four and five M inhabitants, not a case of bronchocele could be pointed out and this village, you know, occupies the site of old Fort Schuyler on the Mohawk, the vicinity of which place so many writers have referred to as the especial spot for the prevalence of the complaint. . . . A similar remark may be made with regard to the former frequency of the disease throughout the extensive region from Utica to Buffalo, (p. 448) Ludlow (60) also reported the frequent occurrence of goiter in the Genesee country in 1822, but in 1837, O'Reilly (61), after referring to Ludlow's statement, added " now, 1837, the reverse." The same great temporal variation in the incidence of goiter, of which Hirsch (1) gives so many other examples is to be found in Pittsburgh. According to Denny (62) (p. 47) : It does not appear that this disease prevailed among the French, who nearly a century ago occupied the site of Pittsburg as a military post. Some of the old inhabitants of Fort Duquesne who were living lately at Auka and Detroit, had no recollection of such a deformity on the banks of La Belle Riviere. Denny states that in 1798, there were 150 cases among 1400 inhabi- tants that in 1806 whole families were afflicted with it, but that in 1825, a recent goiter was unknown. Another instance is furnished by the experience of Nathan Trask (63). In the winter of 1803-1804, he settled at Windsor, Vt. Writing in 1808 (misprint for 1818? I. G.), he stated that when he settled there: . . . almost every female was affected with it [goiter] but the disease gradually decreased, at present it is nearly extinct. There are a number of other reports of the endemic occurrence of goiter in various parts of the eastern United States at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Osier (64) wrote to physicians practicing in those places in 1893. In every case, the disease was much less prevalent than it had been, and, in fact, was usually unknown. We may summarize the conclusions to be drawn from this survey as : 1. The Indians of the Great Lakes, Prairie and Rocky Mountain regions did not suffer from goiter before the coming of Europeans. 2. In many places, at least, the disease appeared first among the whites or half-breeds. 3. The disease, whether among Indians or whites, was most severe</page><page sequence="13">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 241 and most frequent when it first appeared and subsequently diminished both in frequency and severity. Guatemala and Mexico In considering the Indians of the Great Lakes, Plains and Rocky Mountain regions, we were concerned with a more or less nomadic popu- lation of comparatively small numbers. We now turn our attention to a quite different situation: a high population density that equalled, if it did not exceed, that obtaining at any subsequent time. In his memoir, Barton (9) referred to the occurrence of goiter in Mexico and gave as his authority Gage (65), who, about 1635, visited Mexico and travelled about extensively. He described the occurrence of very large goiters at Sacapulas, which is just across the border, in Guate- mala (pp. 255-256), but made no mention of their occurrence elsewhere. It will be noted, however, that the date of his visit was more than a hundred years after the conquest. There are several accounts of the conquest of Guatemala and of the life of the Indians that were written shortly after that time (66) (67) (68) (69). In none of these has any mention of goiter been found, nor is this condition mentioned by either Brasseur de Bourbourg (70) or by Genet and Chelbatz (71). There seems to be no report, other than that of Gage, of the occurrence of goiter in Sacapulas. In 1939, Burbank (72) visiting this town, remarked on the beauty of the Indian women, but made no mention of goiter among them, although he did mention seeing a large goiter near Cantei, some forty miles away, in a straight line. However, goiter is now quite prevalent in Guatemala (73), and it is quite possible that there are instances in Sacapulas. In 1798, the disease was so prevalent in Jacaltenango, in the same province, as to lead Hidalgo (74) to write: En este pueblo todos tienen güegüechos, a hinchadas de gargantas, a causa de las malas aguas que beben. This is followed by a footnote referring to the astonishment which Gage experienced when he saw goiters at Sacapulas. However, although Sacapulas and all the other towns of the province were described by Hidalgo, there is no mention of goiter, in his time , except at Jacaltenango. It may have been absent elsewhere, or it may have been so common every- where as not to excite attention except at such places as Jacaltenango, where everyone had a goiter.</page><page sequence="14">242 ISIDOR GREENWALD In 1825, Thompson (75), travelling from Mexico City to Acapulco, saw, at Tierra Colorado, near Acapulco, three goitrous sisters, one of whom seems to have been a cretin. Thompson then continued his journey to Guatemala by sea. He disembarked at Acajatlan and went to the neighboring town of Sonsonate, both in San Salvador. Of the latter place, he wrote (p. 80) : The inhabitants of Sonsonate, particularly the Creoles, are dreadfully affected with the goitres , or as they call them, buches . Thompson made no mention of the existence of goiter elsewhere. After visiting Guatemala City, he left the country by practically the same route (Rio Yzabel) as was employed thirteen years later for entrance by Montgomery (76). The latter mentions the frequent occurrence of goiter at places visited by Thompson, but in which the earlier traveller did not refer to the presence of goiter. Only a few years after Thompson, Dunn (77) also visited Guatemala, almost exactly reversing the route travelled by Thompson, but reaching the Pacific Coast some distance north of Sonsonate. He wrote (p. 256) : In some of the provinces, the inhabitants are dreadfully afflicted with a swelling in the glands of the throat, vulgarly called " güegüecho " : these sometimes grow to an enormous size and when accompanied by idiotcy or extreme imbecility of mind, which is by no means uncommon, they found a most humiliating and painful spectacle. The names of the provinces in which this condition was observed are not given, and the idiocy mentioned by Dunn is not necessarily cretinism, because the sentences immediately preceding the passage just quoted are : The diseases of the coasts for the most part consist of intermittent fevers, which, when contracted by the inhabitants of the temperate zones, are very difficult to cure, frequently clinging to the sufferer till they produce the most perfect mental debility, and oftentimes idiotcy. The number of idiots and of individuals in other stages of madness is truly melancholy, and these the greater part have been produced by fevers contracted on the coast. The occurrence of goiter in various parts of Guatemala, Nicaragua and San Salvador was also mentioned by Dunlop (78), Squier (79), and by Scherzer (80). It is noteworthy that many of the places at which goiter is said to have existed were at relatively low altitudes and near the sea. Sonsonate, mentioned by Thompson (75), is on the coast, and Squier wrote (79), (Vol. 2, p. 154) :</page><page sequence="15">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 243 In Chinandega, as in fact in every other town of the state, I observed numerous instances of the goitre . . . Chinandega is only seventy feet, and Leon, Granada and Rivas not more than one hundred and fifty feet, above the tide water; yet in all these towns, the goiter is common. Scherzer (80), page 428, made a similar observation regarding the occurrence of goiter at Guaymoco, barely 400 feet above sea level, and in 1864, Bernoulli wrote (81) (page 119) : Die Intensität der kropferzeugenden Ursache ist, wie in Europa, in verschiedenen Gegenden sehr verschieden; an den Küsten und in der Tierra templada ist sie im allgemeinen heftiger als auf den kälteren Hochebenen. However, in 1938, it was precisely in the highlands that Shattuck (73) reported a high incidence of goiter: but only in one village were there " some, apparently of cretinism among the people gathered in the market place." If the idiocy seen by Dunn in 1828 was really cretinism, a great change had occurred during the following century. Much of the present-day Mexico, especially the Valley of Mexico and the surrounding highland, was in pre-Cortesian days, the home of a large and settled population, possessing a written language. The high state of civilization encountered there aroused the interest and admiration of the Conquerors and of those who soon followed them to New Spain. There are several contemporary accounts of the Conquest, some of them by those who actually participated therein. The best of these is generally believed to be that of Bernal Diaz de Castillo. Blanton (82) has written of medical references in this narrative. He does not mention goiter, nor have I been able to find any reference to the occurrence of goiter in Bernal Diaz or in any other early narrative or description of Mexico. Neuburger (83) includes goiter among the diseases recognized and treated by the ancient Mexicans ( p. 47). He gives no specific authority for this, but states (footnote, p. 40) that the Historia de la medicina en Mexico by Francisco A. Flores " has been the basis for my article." That author (84) wrote, under the heading " Laringitis " (Vol. 1, page 129) : Entre los aífeciones de los anexos de la laringe parece que conocieron el bosio quechpozauiliztli ô tozcapuzauliztli, de que hacen mención los autores que se occupan de su antiqua historia. It will be noted that Flores used the word " bosio," which is current Spanish for goiter. However, he gave no authority for his statement regarding its occurrence in Mexico, and I have been able to find none. Our great source of information for the daily life, the handicrafts and</page><page sequence="16">244 ISIDOR GREENWALD the knowledge of nature possessed by the ancient Mexicans is the Historia general de las cosas de Nueva Espana , by Fr. Bernardino de Sahagun. This author was born in Spain in or about 1499. He came to Mexico, as a Franciscan monk in 1529, only seven years after the conquest. He soon interested himself in the life, customs, and knowledge of the Mexi- cans and began to write his book in Aztec about 1546. It was completed about 1570, but aroused the antagonism of the then Provincial of the Order, who had the manuscript and Sahagun's notes dispersed among the various convents of the order. A few years later, they were returned to Sahagun. In the meantime, a summary had been taken to Spain, and had come into the hands of Juan de Ovandes, President of the Indies, who ordered that a complete copy, with a Spanish translation paralleling the Aztec text, be prepared. This was done between 1576 and 1578 (85). Various Spanish editions have appeared and the complete text, with all of the many illustrations, has been republished in Aztec and in Spanish (86). Portions have been translated into English (85) and into German (87), and the entire text has been translated into French by Jourdanet and Simeon (88). The Spanish text reads (Book 10, Chap. 2: (86), Vol. 3, p. 98) : Para la enfermedad de las paperas, e hinchazones de la garganta, sera necesario frotar con le mano la garganta y sangarza y untar la garganta con cierte hierba llamada cocozihuitl , mezelando con cisco de la olla, y beber el agua de la hierba llamada ahacaxilotic. The important word here is " paperas." This particular passage has not yet been published in either German or English translation, but Jourdanet and Simeon translated it as " goitre." However, all the authorities I can find agree in stating that " paperas " may mean not only " goiter," but also any swelling of the anterior part of the throat. Thus, the following definitions have been found : a. tumor que se forma en la papado o en otros puntas del cuello, des de la garganta hasta las oregas (89). b. tumor que se forma en la papado o en otros puntas del cuello (90). c. (1) Wen on the throat (2) Mumps (91) d. Mumps (92) That the word " paperas " was, in Mexico, even in the sixteenth cen- tury, applied to a condition very different from goiter is shown by its use in the Codex Telleriano-Remensis , which was completed before 1562,</page><page sequence="17">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 245 and in the Historia eclesiástica Indiana , by Mendieta, completed in 1596. The Spanish text of the former reads (93) (p. 44) : ano de seis conejos y de 1550 murieron munchos yndios en esta Nueva Espana de paperas. Kingsborough (94) (Vol. 6, p. 151) translated " paperas " as "measles." Stecker (95) (p. 262), on the other hand, believed it was either mumps or diphtheria. The identity of the disease may be in ques- tion, but the author of the codex certainly could not have meant that many Indians died of goiter in that one year. Similarly, Mendieta wrote (96) (page 515) : En fin del ano de noventa y cinco y entrado el de noventa y seis, al tiempo que yo esta escrebia, vino otra generalisma pestilencia, mezclada de serampion paperas y tabardillo. The conjunction of "paperas" with serampion (measles) and tabar- dillo (scarlet fever) is clearly an indication that " paperas " did not mean goiter. Besides the thirteen pages concerned with the diseases of the Indians and the twenty pages devoted to medicinal minerals and plants, Sahagun gave 23 closely printed quarto pages to a description of the various peoples of Mexico.7 Among the people described by Sahagun were the Tarascans in Michoacan. He actually spent some time among them (85) (p. 7). He devoted a page, about 450 words, to a description of the inhabitants, but made no mention of goiter. If this disease had been endemic in Michoacan, or in any other part of the Mexican Empire, it is almost inconceivable that Sahagun would not have mentioned it. In a footnote on page 229, reference has already been made to Moll's claim that Tarascan figures showing goiter have been found. None of this kind are to be found in the remarkable collection of the American Museum of Natural History, although there are several showing achon- droplasia; nor are there any pictured in the 175 plates of Tarascan pottery and stone to be found in Art in Ancient Mexico (97), although there are two of two-headed human monsters. Since Flores, there have been four writers on the medicine of the ancient Mexicans, whose work gives evidence of consultation of the original sources. These are Stecker (95), Gerste (98), Deuchler (99), and Ocaranza (100, 101). The last named gives the Mexican word for thyroid (100), p. 22, but none of these authors lists goiter as among the diseases known to the Mexicans. 7 These numbers are taken from the French translation.</page><page sequence="18">246 ISIDOR GREENWALD That goiter was not of general occurrence in Mexico, even as late as 1780, or shortly before that date, is made probable by the following quotations from Clavigero (102) (Vol. I, p. 78) : There is scarcely a nation, perhaps upon the earth in which there are fewer persons deformed. . . . Among* the young women of Mexico, there are many very beautiful and fair. Vol. 2, p. 340: If the Americans were disposed to retaliate on M. de Pauw and other authors who wrote as he does, they would have abundant subject of material to their dis- credit on the climate of the old continent, and the constitution of its inhabitants in the endemic distempers which prevail there, such as . . . the goiter of Tyrol and many Alpine countries. The earliest definite reference to the occurrence of goiter in present-day Mexico, dates from 1778, when Chappé d'Auteroche (103) reported its presence at Las Vigas, a village near Jalapa, on the road from Vera Cruz to Mexico City. The author travelled through Mexico on his way to California, but the only mention of goiter was at this place. About fifty years later, we have the previously cited reference (page 242) to its occurrence near Acapulco on the west coast, and Hardy's mention of it in various places in Sonora (104). About 1848, we have a record of its occurrence in. Tabasco (105), a report which is repeated in 1865 (106), at which time we have also a report of its presence in Colima, on the west coast (107). It is noteworthy that Coindet (106), who reported the presence of goiter in Tabasco in 1865, explicitly stated that the disease was very rare on the high plateaux. According to Starr (108), Najera (109) and Stacpoole (110), goiter has been, in more recent years, of quite general occurrence in Mexico. Of particular interest, in view of Coindeťs statement that goiter was rare on the high plateaux in 1865, is Stacpoole's report of high incidence in different parts of the Valley of Mexico (110, 111) and the regions about it. To summarize, we may say that there is no evidence that the ancient Mexicans or the Guatemalans suffered from goiter ; that the number and character of the chronicles and descriptions of the country and its people make it extremely unlikely that the disease, if present, would have gone unrecorded; that the disease first appeared as sharply localized outbreaks of considerable severity, and that it later became more general, though not in. the vicinity of the places in which it was first observed.</page><page sequence="19">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 247 Peru In his memoir, Barton (9) (p. 78) stated that goiter had been observed among the Indians of Peru, giving as his authority the translation of Garcilasso de la Vega's Royal Commentaries of Peru by Sir Paul Rycaut : This writer informs us, that the Inca Tupac, after having subdued the province of Cassamarquila, proceeded to another #people called the Papamarca , from the papas or dewlaps which are great bunches that hang from their throats. Barton also wrote (p. 78) Mr. de Pauw speaks of the goiter as a disease of the Indians inhabiting the foothills of the Cordilieres. He ascribes it to the use of snow water. He quotes as authority the voyage of sieur Acarette to Peru. Barton was accurate in his quotation from Sir Paul Rycaut. Unfortu- nately, this translation is incorrect. Sir Clements Markham, in the intro- duction to his own translation of the Royal Commentaries wrote (112) (p. xvi) : An abridged English version of the Royal Commentaries appeared in London in 1688, having been " rendered into English " by Sir Paul Rycaut Kt and dedicated to James II. The worthy knight had a very slight knowledge of the Spanish language and he did not scruple to make wild guesses at the meaning of sentences. Markham, himself, translated the passage in question as (113) (p. 328) : From Cassamarquilla the Ynca advanced to another important village called Papamarca, which means " the village of potatoes " because they grew very large there. The Spanish text reads (114) (Vol. 2, p. 318) : De Cassamarquilla paso a otro puebla principal, llamado Papamarca, que quiere decir, pueblo de papas, porque son muy grandes las que aili se dan. Neither in the Royal Commentaries nor in any other of the early chronicles or descriptions of Peru have I been able to find any reference to the occurrence of goiter among the Indians of the Empire of the Incas. There are many references to the physical characteristics of the Indians, male and female, and to their diseases. D'Harcourt (115), who devoted a book to the medicine of the ancient Peruvians, lists some fifty of their diseases, but goiter is not among them. Barton was equally accurate in his quotation from de Pauw (116) but the latter seems to have misrepresented his authority. The original reads (117) (p. 11):</page><page sequence="20">248 ISIDOR GREENWALD Sant Iago del Estro est un bourg d'environ 300 maisons, sans fossez ny murailles, situé en un pays plat, environné de forests d'algarobe, sur une assez grande riviere, qui porter batteau, et qui est assez poissonneuse. L'air y est fort chaud et fort étouffé, ce qui rend faineans et laches ceux qui y habitent. Ils ont tous le visage fort jaûne, et ne s'adonnent qu'a leurs divertissements et peu au commerce. Il n'y a plus de 300 portans armes tant las sauvages que les esclaves, et sont tous fort mal armez et peu aguerris. La plus part des femmes y sont assez belles, mais elles ont presque toutes une espece de loupe a la gorge, qu'on nomme en langue du pays coto, qui est apparement ce que nous appelons goitre. There is no mention of foothills, nor of snow-water, nor of the disease affecting the Indians. In fact, it would rather appear that it was the white women and not the Indians who had the goiters. This seems to be the only mention of goiter in Acarette's account of his travels from Buenos Aires to Potosi. However, that is now one of the great goiter regions of the world (1) (50), although much of it is only slightly above sea level. Santiago del Estero, itself, is 520 feet above sea level (36) (Vol. 19, 979). Just when goiter made its appearance in Santiago del Estero is not known, but only about thirty years before the visit of Acarette de Biscay, Antonio Vazquez de Espinosa (118), who died in 1630, devoted two pages of his Compendium and Description of the West Indies to this town and its vicinity. These contain no mention of goiter. In fact, he wrote (p. 674) (folio 1772) : The city is built on the bank of a large river. . . . The water of this great river is so health-giving, that many bathe in it to recover their health. There are a number of other references to what may have been goiter, but, more probably, was not, among the Indians about a hundred years after the Conquest. Thus, Pardal, in his book on the medicine of the American aborigines (119) (p. 231), quotes from a Bartolome de Vega as to the occurrence of " paperas debayo de la barba, tan grandes como cidras," among patients with " cancer," probably leishmaniasis, of the nose, in a hospital at Cuzco, established for victims of this disease. Pardal gives no indication as to who this Bartoleme de Vega was nor as to when he lived, nor have I been able to find his name in an encyclo- pedic dictionary of Peruvian biography (120). The "paperas" may have been goiter, but may also have been mumps or some other kind of swollen gland (see pp. 244, 249). In any event, since this hospital was established by a viceroy who came to Peru in 1569 (120) and who first wished to abolish the growing of coca and who only thereafter established this hospital (115), it is evident that this reference, whether or not " paperas " means goiter, deals with a period at least fifty years after the Conquest.</page><page sequence="21">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 249 Calancha (121), in 1638, wrote " en las tierras del Cuzco, y Chuquis- qua hay alguna aqua que a tal o tal persona crian hinchazones en los gargantas, que llaman cotos, y en pueblos de las sierrae hacia Lima, crian algunas aquas, berrugus a tales complexion de gente." Fifteen years later, Cobo (122) described the treatment of "paperas." Con cierta suerte Culebras pequenos, que o no son ponzonsas o su eficacia no es muy vehemente, suelen curar los Indio del Cuzco los paperas que es mal ordinario en aquella ciudad y que afea mucho a la persona que las tienne. Llaman en la dicha ciudad Cotos a estas paperas, y el modo como las curan los Indios es este, tienen algún tiempo sin comer una destos Culebras, y asiéndola con la mano del cuero del pescuezo, la aplican a que muerda la paperas, con lo cual se viene a secar y para quitar el horor al paciente, le vendan los ojos, y si es muchacho, no le dicen la cura que le hacen ni sabe lo que le causo el dolor. Vazquez de Espinosa (118) (p. 658, folio 1722), as translated by Clark, wrote: Chuma, which is a kind of spiny thistle, when sliced and roasted and laid against the sore spot on the goiter (goza) relieves the pain and dispels it; the Indians make use of the juice of this plant in their superstitions; they drink it and lose consciousness, and say that they see all that they desire. The word used by Vazquez de Espinosa is goza, which Clark believed to have been an Andalusian cognate of the Italian gozza. Clark over- looked the fact that the Italian word gozza meant not only goiter, but any inflammation of the throat (123, 124). Moreover, there is no evidence for the existence of such an Andalusian word as " goza." To the present author, it seems that " goza," pronounced " gotha," was an attempt to represent the Quicha word which others have variously rendered as coto (117), goto (125), ccoto (126), and koto (127), which means a heap, a lump, a goiter (126) - or in the Spanish of 1608 (127), paperas, or, also, monton (heap, bunch). The method of treatment described by Vazquez de Espinosa and by Cobo certainly does not indicate the disease in question was goiter. In fact, the particular mention given by Cobo to the treatment of the disorder in boys indicates, rather clearly, that the disease was mumps. What " cotos " or " paperas " may have been is not certain, but it is interesting to note that in 1799, Unanue (128) listed paperas - clearly mumps - as a disease endemic in the fall in the vicinity of Lima. In any event, whether cotos or paperas meant mumps or goiter or neither in the early seventeenth century in Peru, it must be remembered that this was a century after the Conquest. There is, it must be repeated, 3</page><page sequence="22">250 ISIDOR GREENWALD no account of its occurrence among the Indians at the time of the Conquest. About 1600, Poma de Ayula (129) wrote a lengthy work describing the inhabitants of Peru. He illustrated this with hundreds of drawings. I have not read all of the text, which is available only in facsimile repro- duction of the seventeenth century manuscript, but I have examined all of the drawings. None of the human figures show the slightest sign of anything that can possibly be interpreted as goiter. In Peru there have been found large numbers of anthropomorphic vases. These portray normal, blind and mutilated persons. They depict childbirth, sexual intercourse, normal and perverted, and various thera- peutic measures, including trepanning, but there is but one showing goiter. This is in. the Museo de Chiclin (130, 131) and depicts not simple goiter, but exophthalmic goiter. In fact, in the photograph sent me by Dr. Lastres (131), the goiter is not visible, though the exoph- thalmos is pronounced. Dr. Lastres has also seen vases depicting acro- megaly and one showing achondroplasia (132). It is scarcely conceivable that if simple goiter had been endemic anywhere in the Empire of the Incas, which included not only what we now call Peru, but also most of Ecuador, a large part of Bolivia, the north-western part of Argentina and more than half of Chile, that we would not have at least one vase depicting the condition among the thousands that have been unearthed. Ecuador While much of what is now Ecuador had, shortly before the Spanish Conquest, become part of the Inca Empire, its later history is more closely associated with that of Colombia, or New Granada. The failure to find any reference to goiter in the descriptions left us by the early chroniclers of Peru applies also tq the realm of Quito, or most of present-day Ecua- dor. Just when goiter appeared there cannot be definitely stated. It is noteworthy that neither Ulloa (133), Condamine (134), nor Bouquier (135), who visited Quito in 1740, reported the existence of goiter there, although both Ulloa and Condamine mention the presence of other dis- eases there. Even more significant is the fact that in Ulloa' s Noticias Americanos (136), a chapter of 19 pages entitled " De las dolencias que son particulares, según la variadad de los climas, y su comparación," con- tains not a word concerning goiter. Nor is there any mention of this disease in Velasco's Historia del reino de Quito (137), written in 1789, although the physical characteristics and diseases of the Indians are dis-</page><page sequence="23">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 251 cussed. Even in 1823, Humboldt (138) (139), who called the attention of Europeans to the existence of goiter on the eastern slope of the Cordilleras, did not mention its existence in Quito, which he also visited. The earliest reference I have found is that of Empson (140), who in 1836 stated that the disease was especially frequent around Guayaquil, and that it did not exist among the natives of the higher regions of the country. According to Dr. Jose Ramon Boloňa R., Director General Accidental de Sanidad, only rare and sporadic cases of goiter are now (August 22, 1943) to be found in and around Guayaquil or other parts of the littoral. The disease is, however, quite frequent in certain portions of the northern inter- Andean part of the Country (141). Colombia In 1740, Bouquier (135) visited Hondo, and travelled down the Magdalena River, passing through districts in which goiter was, a few years later, extremely prevalent. I have found no mention of goiter in his account of his travels. The first reference to goiter, in what is now Colombia, that I have found, dates from 1760 (142, a. p. 448; b. p. 323). Desda la embocadura del Cauca hacio abajo desaparece esta enfermedad; obser- vación interesante que debo a un medico sabio y observado que en 1760 visito esas regiones ardientes. El ilustre Mutis he ha dado a esta hecho las mas grande autoridad. In the diary of Mutis, under date of January 16, 1762 (143), there is the following entry: Oi decir que los cotos de tierra caliente solian desvancerse en tierra fria; pero los de tierra fria, ni en tierra caliente ni en tierra fria. El Padre Reyes, religioso Dominico, me participo esta noticia. Possibly, even probably, the " cotos " - at any rate, those of the " tierra fria " were goiters and the statement has reference to the occurrence of the disease in the country in 1762. However, goiter was not very prevalent or was regarded as unim- portant even as late as 1789, 1796 and 1803. In 1789, the Bishop of Cordoba, then Governor, in his report to his successor, wrote (144) : La primera y mas terrible de estos epidemia es certamente la de los viruelas. . . . La elephanthium, o lepra lazarina, es otro de los males endémicos que en este Reino aflige a sus inhabitants. ... Yo numero entre los plagas que impuden al aumento</page><page sequence="24">252 ISIDOR GREENWALD de la población de este Reino los enjambres de mendigos que llenan las calles de las principales ciudades. . . . without as much as mentioning goiter. I have not found any mention of goiter in the subsequent reports of the followers of the Bishop to their respective successors in 1796 and 1803. However, by 1808 (142), and certainly, by 1823 (145), the disease was very severe in many localities and was spreading rapidly. This led the Minister of the Interior (145) to suggest that the government offer a reward for the discovery of a cure. The incidence of goiter seems to have been as high as ever observed anywhere: - whole villages being afflicted, and a person without a goiter being regarded as a freak. Humboldt (138) (139) called attention to the fact that the disease had not been known in Bogota before 1790 and that in 1824 it was still rapidly increasing there, though its incidence was not yet as great as in other places. In 1830, Boussingault (146) noted that certain districts of Colombia appeared to be free from the disease. He ascribed this to the use of salt mined locally, which salt contained appreciable amounts of iodine. How- ever, he did not attribute the disease to a lack of iodine, but to a lack of air in the water, and reported several cases in which the use of water that had been allowed to stand for several days appeared to secure freedom from goiter. Much of the country in which goiter has been prevalent for over a century and in which it still constitutes " una tremenda realidad nacional " (147), was, at the time of the Conquest, the home of one of the civilized peoples of South America: the Chibcha Indians.* Their Spanish and German conquerors seem to have been more destructive of all signs of the Indian culture than was the case anywhere else. They had little interest in the natives, except as they could secure gold and jewels from them. Nevertheless, according to Markham (148) (p. 15), Quesada, the chief conqueror, said of them : They were the finest people he had seen in the Indies ; the men well-formed and strong ; the women handsome. Certainly, there is no evidence here of the presence of goiter. We may, therefore, conclude that in South America, as in North America and Central America, the evidence shows that goiter was not * Markham (148) estimates their number shortly before the cataclysm as 1,200,000, or 200 to the square mile.</page><page sequence="25">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 253 endemic among the Indians, that it appeared after the coming of white men, in most places only a century or more thereafter, and that it was at one time very common in some places in which it later became infrequent. New Zealand In the course of their report on the correlation between the low iodine content of certain New Zealand soils and the incidence of goiter in the districts from which these soils were obtained, Hercus, Benson and Carter (149) refer to previous reports regarding the nonoccurrence of goiter among the Maoris in the following terms (p. 131) : Enquiry from old Maoris established the fact that goiter has been prevalent in this region (Urawera, I. G.) for a considerable period, certainly before European occupation of New Zealand, in spite of numerous published statements to the con- trary. This fact was later confirmed by Sir Maui Pomare, Minister of Public Health, who pointed out that the Maori language has contained the name " tenga " meaning goiter for many generations. The disease occurred amongst such isolated tribes as the one under investigation and was unknown amongst the coastal tribes, where fish and edible seaweed bulked largely in the dietary. It is not clear from the context that Sir Maui Pomare meant the " many generations " to antedate the coming of white men. If he did, and the statement is otherwise pointless, it is in order to ask how one can be certain that a word existed for " many generations " in a language that had no written literature. One would also like to know how one can be certain that the word " tenga" meant "goiter" and not merely any swelling in the neck, particularly since it is known that scrofula was very prevalent at least as early as 1854 (150). As a matter of fact, the word " tenga " appears in early Maori-English dictionaries as meaning "Adam's apple" (151) and that is the only meaning ascribed to it as late as 1891 (152) and 1911 (153). The earliest use of the word as meaning " goiter " that I have been able to find was in 1917 (154), when it appeared as the third of a series of six meanings. The others were: 1) Adam's apple, 2) crop of a bird, 4) distended or strained, 5) gorged, 6) extinguished. A similar word " ngene " appeared in a small phrase book in 1911 as meaning "goiter (153), but in 1891 (152), it had been defined as "a scrofulous wen," and in 1917 (154), three meanings were given: e.g., 1) scrofulous wen, 2) wrinkle, fold, 3) fat. The earliest Maori equiva- lent for goiter that I have been able to find is " Pukaki " in 1891 (152). This word is defined as a wen, a goiter, a scrofulous swelling in the neck.</page><page sequence="26">254 ISIDOR GREENWALD It is said to be derived from " pu," a bundle, a bunch, and " kaki," the neck. The failure to include a word for goiter in early dictionaries may have been due to ignorance of the early lexicographers of the Maori language, and, in particular, of that of the tribes of the Urawera region. However, it is curious that the dictionaries published before the first recorded out- break of goiter do not include a Maori equivalent, whereas those pub- lished thirty or more years later, do. Certainly, it cannot be seriously maintained that " tenga " meant only " goiter " or that the Maoris were more successful in distinguishing goiter from scrofula than were English- men of the same period (see below). The claim that the use of the word " tenga " indicates the existence of goiter among the Maoris, prior to the arrival of Europeans, may, therefore, be dismissed. Nor can one accept the statement of " old Maoris " in 1925 as to the presence of goiter a century earlier. No other account of native life and customs that I have been able to find mentions the existence of goiter. Among the " numerous published accounts to the contrary," it is necessary to mention only three; (150), (155), and (156). Not only does goiter seem to have been unknown to the Maoris, but it appears that the early European settlers were similarly free from the disease for a considerable period. The earliest mention that I have been able to find refers to its occurrence in 1880. The vicinity was settled in 1850, but the first reference to goiter is thirty years later, and is not to an isolated case, but to an endemic condition (157, p. 60, and 158). On taking office at the Asylum, I was surprised to find so many patients suffering from goiter. . . . The attendant's children suffered from it, and there is no doubt but that it is endemic here and especially so in this vicinity. We are, therefore, quite justified in adding New Zealand to the list of countries in which goiter was unknown before the coming of white men, but in which, when it appeared, it rapidly became endemic. England The Oxford Dictionary (159) attempts to list the earliest occurrence of every English word. " Goiter " or " goitre " was first used in the seventeenth century and was applied to a condition observed among the inhabitants of the Alps, Savoy, etc. The word " wen," as applied to a protuberance in the throat , was used as early as 1530 (160), but only as a translation of the French word " gouistre " or " gouystre." In 1617</page><page sequence="27">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 255 (161), it was employed in a description of the people of Styria and Carinthia. The first use of " bronchocele " is credited to A Physical Dictionary of 1657, which is not available to me. The mention of the goiters or " wehnes in the neck " of the inhabitants of Styria and Carinthia by Fynes Morison (161) is particularly interest- ing. He saw these in 1593 and mentioned them in the book he wrote between 1605 and 1617. In this book he also included a description of the various shires of England. He gave only fifteen lines to Derbyshire, but did not include any mention of goiters or wens there, nor did he mention their occurrence anywhere in England. In " The Tempest," Shakespeare has Gonzalo says (Act 3, Scene 3, line 44) : Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys, Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find Each putter-out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of. . . . The phrase " putter out of five for one " means a traveller and reflects an inverted form of life insurance that was in vogue in Shakespeare's day (162). The reference to "mountaineers, dew lapped like bulls" is generally believed to be to goitrous individuals seen in the Alps, etc., and reported to the English by returning travellers. Certainly, if goiter had been common in England about 1610, or earlier, Shakespeare could scarcely have had Gonzalo mention this condition as one unheard-of in his boyhood and only recently described by travellers. Harington (10) credits Wiseman (1676) with the recognition of goiter, or bronchocele, in England. This particular edition of Wiseman's treatise is not available to me, but later ones are. The fifth and sixth editions (163) (164) published in 1719 and 1734 respectively, contain thirty reports of cases of the King's Evil. Of these, fifteen concern tumors in the neck, and of these, two are called bronchocele. One of these is described as : a complicated Tumour lying on the left side of the Neck. Wiseman : . . . made a puncture into the Body of it and discharged a stinking Serum not unlike Horse-piss.</page><page sequence="28">256 ISIDOR GREENWALD (Vol. 1, p. 444 (163)) (Vol. 1, p. 452 (163)). The other supposed bronchocele was in a girl of fourteen ( (163), Vol. 1, p. 45). It was a . . . complicated Tumour of great bulk on the left side of her neck and cheek, arising under her ear. It was treated with escharotics, broke down and We thereby discovered the tumour to consist of many several species, viz., Struma, Atheroma, Meliceris, and Steatoma. Certainly, the first case was not goiter, and in all probability, neither was the second. The word " bronchocele " was also used by Salmon (165) in 1680, who describes the removal of a bronchocele. The description, including such terms as " the bag," " the little artery by which it is fed " plainly indicates that a scrofulous lymph gland is meant. Bronchocele was also discussed by Brown (166) in 1684. He men- tioned its frequent occurrence in Piedmont and seems to indicate that he, himself, had seen cases, presumably in England, for I have known many people also cured of this by His Majestie's gracious touch only. Brown's account, which is too long to quote here, is an excellent illus- tration of what seems to have troubled the English physicians of his day. They had read of goiter or bronchocele in Piedmont and elsewhere, and some of them had, possibly, seen cases in the course of their travels. They saw many tumours of the neck in England, and, naturally tried to identify some of them with what they had seen, or read of, among the people of the Alps. However, what they saw in England was scrofula and not goiter. The same confusion is to be found in John Friend's History of Physich , written in 1723 (167), Vol. 2, p. 148: Tumours very often happen in the Thyroidal glands, but such a swelling is not properly called a Bronchocele , though sometimes so miscalled, but a Struma , or Scrophula colli. The first clear indication of endemic goiter in England is to be found in the use of the terms " Derbyshire Neck " or " Derby Neck." The Oxford Dictionary credits Prosser (168) with the first use of this term, in 1769, but it is also to be found in James' Medical Dictionary of 1743 (169). The confusion with scrofula is still evident in the latter, and, indeed, it persisted for many years - even into the nineteenth century, as evidenced by Bell in 1801 (170) (Vol. 1, page 277) :</page><page sequence="29">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 257 Every indolent tumour, situated on the forepart of the neck, is commonly called a bronchocele. That goiter was not prevalent in Derbyshire as late as 1700, is indi- cated by the fact that Leigh, a Doctor of Physick, did not mention it in the fifty-pages devoted to distempers in his The Natural History of Lancashire , Cheshire and the Peak , in Derbyshire. Among the diseases mentioned were concretions, rickets, scrofula, scurvy, consumption and dropsy. It is scarcely conceivable that goiter, if as prevalent as in 1743, when it already was known as " Derbyshire neck," should not have been mentioned. According to Wilmer (172), the use of burnt sponge in the treatment of bronchocele in the vicinity of Coventry dates back to more than 20 or 30 years before 1779. Whether or not all of the cases so treated were goiter, there can be no doubt that at some time before 1743, goiter had become endemic in Derbyshire. By 1800, " swelled necks " were also reported from Gloucestershire and Shropshire (173) ; and, in 1824, bron- chocele was common in some parts of Westmoreland (174). During the decade 1825-34, goiter was occasionally observed in Devonshire, but during that period, of 11, 259 patients admitted to the Exeter Dispensery, only 39 had " bronchocele." The number per year varied from 1 to 7 (175). By 1836, goiter was described as occurring in Buckinghamshire and in London (176) and in Yorkshire (177). Accurate information regarding the incidence of goiter in Derbyshire in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is not available. However, it is interesting to note that Webb (178) in 1886 wrote (p. 687) : It is much less prevalent now than it was thirty years ago, and yet the women drink the same waters. Derbyshire was not, in 1924-5, the date of a fairly complete survey (179) (180), the district in England and Wales showing the greatest incidence of goiter. That was to be found in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset and in Oxford, Buckingham, Hampshire and Wiltshire. In fact, at least one-fourth the area of England seems to have had as high an incidence of goiter as had Derbyshire and only one-half had a decidedly lower incidence. It would seem that the disease had spread from its original focus and is now, or was recently, more prevalent elsewhere. Discussion Why was there this unenviable predominance in the incidence of goiter in Derbyshire in the middle of the eighteenth century? Why did goiter</page><page sequence="30">258 ISIDOR GREENWALD become generally prevalent in England later, although unknown or at least unnoticed elsewhere in England until the beginning of the 19th century ? It may very well be that the concentration of iodine in the food and water diminished in the course of time. Nearly all iodides are very soluble, and it is possible that they tend to leach out of the soil. The same explanation, plus the changes in the character of the diet, may be offered for the present, or recent, incidence of goiter in New Zealand and in the Americas, particularly in the Great Lakes region of North America. However, these will scarcely explain the known great decreases in the incidence. Only a few of these have been mentioned in this review. There are many others instanced by Hirsch ( 1 ) who also collected many reports of the outbreak of goiter in truly epidemic fashion. In some of these, the drinking water seems to have been implicated; in others, it was at least as clearly not the precipitating agent. It is impossible to read these accounts without being impressed with the resemblance to the reports of the outbreak of poliomyelitis; sometimes apparently water- borne; sometimes, apparently due to personal contact. Nor can we dis- miss the successful production of thyroid enlargement and goiter by McCarrison (181) simply because he was unable to secure the same results later. In his Harvey Lecture, Marine said ((182), p. 108) : The immediate cause of thyroid enlargement is a relative or an absolute deficiency of iodine. This deficiency may result from 1 ) any factors which increase the needs of the organism for the iodine-containing hormone. . . . 2) any factors which interfere with the absorption or utilization of the normal intake of iodine. We have no knowledge, as yet, of such factors, although it is conceivable that the intestinal parasites could utilize or divert part of this iodine intake. 3) factors which bring about an abnormally low intake or actual deprivation of iodine, either natural or experimental. We now know several chemical factors that produce goiter, or at least bring about thyroid enlargements in animals on diets that are otherwise satisfactory (183) (184) (185). There is, a priori, no reason why biological agents should not produce the same effect. Fully conscious of the paucity of the evidence, the author ventures to revive the old suggestion of Humboldt, Hirsch and others that goiter may be due to a biological agent. In the author's opinion, this agent was present in western Europe, about two thousand years ago, only in the</page><page sequence="31">GOITER IN THE AMERICAS, IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IN ENGLAND 259 Alps. From there, it has slowly spread over the rest of western Europe and to New Zealand and to the Americas. In many instances, its first appearance was marked by severe outbreaks, after which the disease became less active. With this hypothesis in mind, an attempt was made to search the history of Derbyshire for some occurrence that might indicate why goiter appeared in England, at first in this locality and, only later, elsewhere. It was found that up to the early part of the eighteenth century, Eng- land was dependent upon Italy for the supply of a certain important kind of silk yarn. In 1717, John Lombe travelled from Derby to Italy, found employment in a silk mill in Piedmont, learned the method of preparing this yarn, and brought back to Derby with him two natives of Piedmont (186) (187). This part of Italy is a notorious goiter district and it is an interesting speculation that Lombe or his two companions introduced not only silk-throwing, but also goiter into England. That, in the space of 25 years, goiter should have become so prevalent in Derbyshire as to achieve the appellation " Derbyshire neck " and the inclusion of this term in a dictionary is remarkable. However, it seems little, if any, more remarkable than the prevalence of goiter and cretinism in Edmonton 11 years after its founding and about 20 years after the first settlement by Europeans anywhere in the vicinity, and its virtual disappearance within eighty years. And it is certainly no more remark- able than the rise of the incidence of goiter from zero to over 10% and its subsequent fall to zero in Pittsburgh, all in a space of less than fifty years. Summary Examination of the reports of early explorers, travellers and mis- sionaries discloses no evidence of the presence of goiter in the Americas or in New Zealand before the coming of Europeans. In every case, the earliest reports are to the occurrence of the disease among white men and women. The detailed accounts of the physique, diseases and mode of life of the natives to be found in these early reports assure us that endemic goiter, if it existed, would have been recorded. It is, therefore, concluded that it did not exist. In several cases, we have definite statements on the part of early explorers and residents to this effect. Early in the nineteenth century, goiter became very prevalent in certain places in both North and South America. Later its incidence declined in many of these.</page><page sequence="32">260 ISIDOR GREENWALD Examination of English literature indicates that goiter was known to Englishmen only as a disease that was prevalent in Switzerland and in neighboring alpine regions, until the eighteenth century, when it quite suddenly became prevalent in Derbyshire. Later, its occurrence became more general, arid this district lost its pre-eminence. Reference is made to the many other instances of variation in the incidence of goiter and of epidemic outbreaks to be found in the literature. It is suggested that these indicate that one factor in the production of goiter is a biological agent, possibly a virus, brought into Derbyshire, with the introduction of silk-throwing, from Italy in 1717 and into the Americas, and into New Zealand by white men at different times.
