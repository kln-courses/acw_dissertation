<plain_text><page sequence="1">ClassicVeracruz Sculptures The indigenous art of the Americas, though known to West erners since the sixteenth century, has been slow to receive the widespread admiration which its intrinsic qualities warrant. Only in the twentieth century, with the partial abandonment of the Graeco-Roman conception of beauty, has Pre-Colum bian art assumed its rightful place among the world's great traditions of the visual arts. In part, no doubt, because the structures of many major European and American art mu seums were established before the aesthetic merit of this tradi tion had been widely recognized, Pre-Columbian art has frequently been relegated to the custody of museums with archaeological or ethnographical biases. Though knowledge of the context of any object of material culture is necessary for an understanding of the intentions of its creator and of its function within a given society, great aesthetic quality is a characteristic of certain objects which can transcend differ ences of culture to speak to all men, though perhaps with less fluency than that which it enjoyed within the society which created it. However, if a work of art is examined and under stood from precisely the same point of view as any other object of material culture, its unique aesthetic qualities may be over looked. That is the limitation frequently imposed by the con textual mode of exhibition customary in museums of scientific bent. Undoubtedly the existing institutional structures which had classified Pre-Columbian artifacts as objects of scientific, rather than artistic, interest-regardless of their intrinsic aesthetic merit-served to retard the reevaluation of such works of art in the light of changing attitudes toward the Graeco-Roman aesthetic tradition. Beginning in the 1930's The Cleveland Museum of Art, under the direction of William Milliken, was one of the first art museums in the United States to devote significant atten tion-in the form of funds for acquisitions, curatorial interest, and exhibition space-to the field of Pre-Columbian art. At that time most large American art museums owned some ex amples of indigenous American art, but little concerted effort had been made to develop collections which would represent the various cultures and media of the Americas with examples of high aesthetic merit. This was precisely the program Mr. Milliken set for the Cleveland Museum, and with the help of several friends of the Museum-notably Mrs. R. Henry Norweb and Miss Helen Humphreys-and with the coopera tion of the dealer John Wise, that task had been substantially accomplished at the time of his retirement as director of the Museum in 1958. Since that date further acquisitions have been made in the field, building upon the framework of an established pattern of collecting. Today the collection of Pre Columbian art at the Cleveland Museum must rank among the very best owned by any general art museum, in terms of the aesthetic merit and stylistic variety of the material it contains. Primary credit for this circumstance must go to the taste and pioneering spirit of William Milliken's collecting in this field. Among the early acquisitions of Pre-Columbian art by the Museum was an almost life-size, terra-cotta head of a young man (Fig. 1).1 It comes from the Gulf Coast region of Mexico encompassed by the modern state of Veracruz. In recent years many large-scale ceramic sculptures have been found in the Figure 1. Head. Terra cotta, H. 11-1/16 inches (28.3 cm.), Classic Veracruz Style, before 1200. Mexico, Veracruz.

CMA 73.3 Veracruz region, but none exceeds this head in precision of modeling, realism of representation, and sensitivity of expres sion. With this undoubted masterpiece as its cornerstone, the Museum's collection of the art of Veracruz has been gradually extended to include examples of most of the major forms of artistic expression produced in this region-several of them on a qualitative level comparable to that of the head. Two very important examples of the art of the Veracruz region have recently been added to the collections of the Cleveland Museum. The first of these is a palma stone-so named because its shape recalls that of a palm frond (Figs. 2 and 3).2 This piece is well known to students and connoisseurs of Pre-Columbian art because of its frequent reproduction in published works on the subject;3 it is also familiar to the Cleveland public, since it has been on view here as a loan since 1958. The richness of its complex decorations-carefully ex ecuted in a rather intractable, porous, volcanic stone-com bined with a fine sense of proportion, both in the relationship of scale between the decorations and the piece as a whole and in the overall shape of the sculpture, make this palma one of the finest known examples of the form. The second addition is less well known than the palma. It is a yoke which was for some years in the Tishman Collection in New York (Cover and Fig. 4).4 It seems to have been exhibited and reproduced only once before its acquisition by this Mu seum, in the exhibition and its accompanying catalogue, Before Cortes, Sculpture of Middle America, produced by the Metropolitan Museum in 1970.5 If less famous than the palma, this yoke is also a distinguished example of its form. It is made of serpentine-a hard, close-grained stone which permits detailed carving and incision of its surface. Further more, the serpentine has been given a smooth, lustrous polish on its outer surfaces, enhancing the inherent beauty of its color and markings. As a further embellishment, much of the surface was originally coated with red cinnabar pigment, ex tensive traces of which remain, contrasting attractively with the color of its stone. In addition to having almost certainly been made and dis covered in the Veracruz region, the palma and yoke share several other common characteristics. Their forms are clearly associated with the ceremonial ball games which played a significant role in several cultures of Mexico and Central America, but which seem to have assumed an especially im portant part in the art, and probably in the lives, of the people of Veracruz. Iconographically they are related, since motifs as sociated with death are to be found on both pieces, although as i . ... we shall see, the meanings of these motifs are probably some what different in the two pieces. Finally, the yoke and the palma were made within the same time span, the period gener ally described as Classic Veracruz, which probably extended from about AD 600 to 1200. Both seem to have been made rather late in the Classic Veracruz period-the palma prob ably at its very end, the yoke perhaps a century or so earlier. In comparison to the study of ancient Egypt, Greece, or China, great problems are encountered in efforts to unravel the cultural history of the Americas. Although artifacts are varied and abundant and most can be given a relative chrono logical position on the basis of archaeological information, our interpretation of the meaning of these artifacts (particu larly those related to religious beliefs and practices) remains extremely sketchy. For information about such matters we 323</page><page sequence="4">.i: I _.I .rr i ;~ B'?: are dependent upon a few written records-codices and in scriptions-many of which still defy certain interpretation, and upon the descriptions of early Spanish conquerors, who may be presumed to have been both ignorant of and unsym pathetic with many aspects of the cultures which they en countered in the New World. Most of the written records which survive date from the end of the Pre-Columbian time sequence, in the years just before or just after the arrival of the Spaniards. Evidence offered by the artifacts themselves indicates considerable continuity, both chronologically and geographically, among the high cultures of southern Mexico and northern Central America. However, with religious be liefs and ceremonies as complex as those to be found in this region, one must presume many local and temporal varia tions, a presumption also confirmed by the evidence of the artifacts. If evidence in the form of written records is sparse concern ing Pre-Columbian Mexico in general, it is virtually non existent for Veracruz in the Classic period. Our knowledge of this culture is based almost entirely upon inferences drawn from material remains. On that basis we know, for example, that a rich and sophisticated culture flourished in what is now Veracruz, that a great ceremonial center of this society existed at the site known as El Tajin, that an art was produced by its inhabitants which is related stylistically to that of the con temporary cultures in the Valley of Mexico to the west and to that of the Mayas to the south, and that similarities in the representation of deities and the construction of ceremonial centers indicate the existence of parallel religious beliefs and practices. Nevertheless, our view of the Classic culture of Veracruz remains extremely hazy, particularly in its more esoteric aspects. For example, knowledge of religious beliefs and customs of the region is based upon correlations which can be drawn between representations of deities and cere monies on artifacts from Veracruz and depictions in codices and the descriptions of Spanish chroniclers, both of which were concerned primarily with the society which flourished in the central Valley of Mexico several hundred years after the culture of Classic Veracruz had ceased to exist. This must have occurred about 1200, since some of the sculptures at El Tajin exhibit the stylistic and iconographic influence of the Toltecs who succeeded the Classic culture of the Valley of Mexico, that of Teotihuacan, around 1000. On the other hand, ceramics of post-Classic types have not been found at El Tajin. It can, therefore, be presumed that although a Classic culture survived in Veracruz for a longer time than in most other parts of Mexico (notably at Teotihuacan), it ended before post-Classic ceramic types became widely distributed, about 1200. When the Spaniards arrived in the sixteenth cen tury, they found that Veracruz was occupied by a linguisti cally distinct group, the Totonacs, who were dominated by means of military outposts by the successors of the Toltecs, 324</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4.

Purchase, Leonard C. Hanna Jr. Bequest. CMA 73.213 the Aztecs of Central Mexico. So completely had the classic culture of Veracruz been submerged that even the existence of the great ceremonial center of El Tajin had been forgotten. It was not rediscovered until the eighteenth century. From that time until recently it was presumed that the Totonacs were the descendents of the builders of El Tajin, and works of art of the Classic period from Veracruz were referred to as "in the Totonac style." There is, however, no direct evidence linking the historical Totonacs with the builders of El Tajin; there are legends which contradict this assumption, indicating the migration of peoples from Veracruz to southern Mexico and Guatemala at the time of the collapse of the Classic cul ture around 1200. To avoid unnecessary assumptions of cul tural relationships, the term "Classic Veracruz" has come to be employed in recent years to describe the style of the art produced by the people who constructed El Tajin.6 The Veracruz region has not received much attention from archaeologists. Even the major site of El Tajin has been only partly uncovered. A fairly large number of objects in stone and clay exist which are said to be of Veracruz origin, but most of these were discovered outside controlled archaeo logical conditions. Therefore, their source is usually described in only vague, general terms. Despite this lack of precise in formation, it seems safe to say that certain kinds of works of art have been found much more frequently in the Veracruz region than elsewhere in Mexico and can therefore be pre sumed to have been made there. Two of these forms-the palma and the yoke-almost certainly originated as para phernalia used by participants in the ceremonial ball games. A relief (Fig. 5) which forms part of the decorations of one of the ball courts at El Tajin shows a scene of human sacrifice in which both the executioner and his victim are represented wearing yokes around their waists with palmas fitted into the tops of the yokes and protruding upward in front of their chests. Our knowledge of the ceremonial ball games of Mexico and Central America is sketchy. It is derived from sculptural representations of persons wearing the costume associated with the ball games, from the archaeological evidence of the ball courts themselves, and by analogy with descriptions of ball games played by Indians in both North and South America in more recent times. From the evidence of archae ology, we know that ball courts existed widely in Mexico and Central America during the Classic period. They were gener ally located in the vicinity of temple complexes, which leads to the assumption that, although a popular activity upon the Figure 5. Relieffrom a Ball Court at El Tajin.

To judge from sculptural representa tions and descriptions by the Spanish, the games were played with a large rubber ball made from the sap of a tree native to the Veracruz region. Teams were involved, and the object appears to have been to hit the ball with parts of the body other than the hands and feet. This seems to be the best ex planation for the origin of the palma and yoke, which would have protected the torso of players from the force of the flying ball. The relief from El Tajin implies that, at least on some occasions, a human sacrifice was an outcome of the games.7 That the palma and yoke were accouterments of the ball games seems clearly established. That the stone versions of these objects, found chiefly in the Veracruz region, were ac tually worn is much less certain. The stone yokes are of a size and shape which makes possible their placement around the waist, above the hips, but the wearing of them in this fashion would have severely inhibited the activity of a ball player. It seems more likely that the surviving stone yokes represent translations into a more permanent medium of functional forms made in some other material-probably wood, bas ketry, or leather. It is even less likely that stone palmas were actually worn.

Yoke. CMA 73.213 Figure 7. Detail of Figure 4. At both ends of these yokes are elements representing hind legs. The yoke in Cleveland appears to be a most unusual variant of this typical method of design. In the center of its curve is a face with a wide mouth which recalls the frog yokes. but the upper part of the face of the Cleveland yoke is clearly that of a skull-not of a living creature (see Cover). At either side of the face are scrolled elements which suggest ears (Fig. 4). On the upper surface of the yoke, two rattlesnakes are depicted. Their heads are represented at the point where the curve of the yoke begins to straighten, with their bodies ex tending along the upper surface of the yoke toward the arch, where they intertwine and double back to either side (Fig. 6). The serpents' bodies are represented as passing beneath their heads and then trailing down the outer surface of the yoke to end in a series of rattles (Fig. 7). When examined closely, it can be observed that the tails overlay an area of slight relief which in shape resembles that of the forelegs of the frog yokes. Thus, the serpent tails with their rattles appear to become visual metaphors for the forelegs as represented in the fre quently encountered frog yokes. Beyond the serpents, in the straight portion of the Cleveland yoke, one finds two skulls (perhaps human) with a bunch of feathers tied on top (Fig. 7). The feathers trail down onto the inner surface of the yoke (Fig. 6). Here again, though less obviously, a visual metaphor may have been intended, for the general shape of the mass of these skulls is close to that of the rounded portions of the frog yokes which presumably represent their bodies. The Cleve land yoke ends with the open-mouthed heads of grotesque creatures-perhaps jaguars with turned-up snouts (Fig. 7). Here again, when the general outlines of the heads are con sidered, one can observe a remarkable resemblance to the customary profile of the hind legs on frog yokes. The complexity of the subject matter of this yoke inevitably leads one to speculate about its intended meaning. Although nothing is known about the mythology of the people who created the culture which we call Classic Veracruz, at least a suggestion about the significance of the symbols on this yoke can be made by analogy with what is known of the religion of the Nahua-speaking peoples of Central Mexico-the creators of Teotihuacan, and later the Toltecs and Aztecs-and, to a lesser degree, of the Mayas to the south. Of primary signifi cance in the religious thought of both groups would seem to have been a unifying principle according to which apparently contradictory phenomena are seen merely as two aspects of a single motivating force.10 Central to their thought, and acces sible to the Western mind, was a cyclical conception of time 326</page><page sequence="7">":'??~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~og ;~~~~~~~~ lI -N t' An'ae,' -tE9 c .f ... .

Thus death, a characteristic of all matter, contains also within itself the implication of re generation. This, in essence, seems to be the intended symbolic meaning of the Cleveland yoke. The skulls which form a major element in its decoration are self-evidently symbolic of death. The frog-like creature which is suggested by the yoke in its entirety is perhaps a reference to the underworld-the region of death-with which the frog is particularly associated. On the other hand, the intertwined serpents which overlie much of the yoke's surface can perhaps be understood as illustrating the Nahua myth according to which heaven and earth were created by the tearing apart of the earth monster by two ser pents, a necessary first step in the structuring of an environ ment in which man might live.ll The symbolism of frog yokes has sometimes been identified as a representation of the earth monster.12 In broader terms, the visual ambiguities of this yoke-serpent tails which are also forelegs, jaguar heads which are hind quarters-create a physical actuality ana logous to the philosophical principle of the essential unity of apparently contradictory forces, which finds frequent ex pression in Mexican mythology. The symbolism of the Cleveland palma is also complex, although perhaps not so esoteric as that of the yoke, since it seems to refer specifically to the ceremonial ball game and only indirectly, if at all, to broader philosophical principles. The chief face of the palma is dominated by what appears to be the representation of a standing man who wears a coyote mask (Fig. 2).13 Above the mask rise five stylized feathers. At their base is a globular form with an upward extension. This portion of the headdress has been damaged and its intended form cannot be accurately determined. The figure's right arm is bent at the elbow; it appears that a now-missing object was once grasped in his right hand. The coyote-masked figure wears a complex costume which seems to consist of padded garments, presumably forming a kind of armor. The knees, forearms, and chest are particularly well protected. This cos tume perhaps reflects those worn by players in the ball games, but it is only vaguely similar to visual representations of per sons who can with some certainty be identified as participants in the games. Of greater significance is the coyote mask, for the coyote was the totemic emblem of one of the warrior societies from which the competing teams of the ball games were presumably drawn.14 In relation to this animal it should also be mentioned that the Cleveland palma is reported to have come from the great northern Veracruz ceremonial 327</page><page sequence="8">: ~ ~ ~ +. , r. .? ~~~~~?~~n ., ~Figure 8. Detail of Figure 2. 13~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"??~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ . .;~ L ..I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ center of El Tajin.15 In the local language of this region, the name El Tajin means lightning.16 The meteorological phe nomenon of lightning is associated in Nahua legend with Xolotl, the twin of the important mythological figure Quet zalcoatl.17 Xolotl is variously represented as a dog or coyote. Since the coyote is a small American member of the wolf family, it is, of course, closely related zoologically to the dog. It seems possible that Xolotl may have had special significance for the people of El Tajin, and that his image, the coyote, may therefore have been chosen as the totem of a warrior society of this region. On the front of the Cleveland palma the figure is wearing a coyote mask surrounded by scrolled elements. Included in this maze of decoration are five partially represented human profiles, the existence of which is disguised by the rich pat terning of their environment (Fig. 8). Another profile relief decorates the plinth upon which the figure stands. The sym bolic significance, if any, of the scrolled elements and partially revealed visages of this decorative background remains obscure. Except for its lowest portion, the back of the Cleveland palma is entirely covered by a complex composition con sisting primarily of human and animal representations carved in very low relief. The figures are surrounded by a presumably purely ornamental border of scrolled elements. At the center of the composition are two human figures-one supine, the other, half-kneeling above him, holds aloft in one hand a stone knife with which he is apparently preparing to make a blood sacrifice of the reclining personage (Fig. 9). Extending up ward from this group of two figures are four parallel, partially intertwined serpent-like elements which perhaps represent the ascension of the sacrificial victim after death. At the center of the palma's top a bat is shown swooping down from above (Fig. 3). In its mouth it holds a leg and in its two claws are a head and arm. These elements presumably represent dismem bered parts of the sacrificial victim of the central tableau. Four animals are to be seen flanking the serpent-like elements and the bat. Except for the rabbit their species are not easy to identify, but they appear to be a coyote (left) and a deer (right) below, and a rabbit (left) and a bear (right) above. Beneath the central sacrificial group stand two apparently human figures wearing animal masks.18 Each holds aloft one arm. The figure to the left supports one foot of the sacrificial victim with his raised arm; that to the right holds up an unidentified object. In their other two hands these figures hold what appear to be short staffs. It is difficult to identify the animal intended 328</page><page sequence="9">to be represented by the mask worn by these standing figures. It is perhaps the jaguar. The precise meaning of the composition on the reverse of the palma and the significance of its various protagonists is un clear. Since it is on the back of a palma-a form which seems to have originated as part of the paraphernalia worn at cere monial ball games-a relationship is suggested between the central vignette of human sacrifice and similar depictions which exist as part of the sculptural decorations of ball courts at El Tajin (Fig. 5). Such sacrifices were apparently an out come of at least some ball games. The presence of the bat holding various parts of a dismembered body reinforces the inference that a human sacrifice related to a ceremonial ball game is the central theme of the composition, since in Mexican mythology the bat is associated with such tales, including in one instance an incident in which a human head struck off by a bat was later hung up as a trophy in a ball court.19 It seems at least possible that, taken as a whole, the Cleveland palma is symbolic of a victory in a ceremonial ball game won by a team of which the coyote was the totem. It was perhaps the vanquished leader of the opposing team whose sacrifice is represented on the palma's reverse. The Cleveland yoke is not easy to place stylistically or chronologically. With the exception of a very similar yoke in the Saenz Collection in Mexico City, it is without close paral lels among known, surviving yokes.20 Proskouriakoff has at tempted to classify Veracruz sculpture stylistically, relying chiefly on the various forms assumed by scrolls and border designs.21 Unfortunately, scrolled elements are not abundant on the Cleveland yoke. In fact, only one pair of scrolls exist on this yoke which do not seem to fulfill a descriptive function. They are immediately adjacent to elements on the outer sur face of the yoke which probably represent ears (Fig. 4). These scrolls are of an almost rectilinear form and are firmly and regularly outlined.22 They do not correspond precisely in form to any of the scroll patterns which Proskouriakoff has estab lished as traits for the stylistic classification of Veracruz sculpture, but they seem to be closest to the scrolls on her Yoke 28. Proskouriakoff relates Yoke 28 stylistically to a monument found buried within the lower platform of a struc ture at El Tajin.23 This monument can be presumed to be older than the platform within which it was found, but because so little is known about the chronological sequence at El Tajin, Proskouriakoff makes no attempt to date it precisely. A pos sible iconographic relationship between the Cleveland yoke and the so-called frog yokes has been mentioned. On the basis of the style of the low-relief scrolled patterns with which parts of these frog yokes are typically decorated, Proskouriakoff has hypothesized that this variety of yoke is among the latest in date of such Veracruz sculptures.24 Despite their possible iconographic relationship, the style of the Cleveland yoke has little in common with the standard frog yokes; thus, there is no reason to presume that they were made at the same time. The evidence for the dating of the Cleveland yoke is admit tedly very slim, but that which does exist indicates that it was executed perhaps a century or more before El Tajin was abandoned about 1200. Unlike the yoke, the Cleveland palma is among the Vera cruz sculptures specifically discussed by Proskouriakoff.25 She relates its style to that of the reliefs at the ball courts at El Tajin and points out several characteristics shared by these sculptures which indicate that they are late examples in the Classic Veracruz sequence (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). The most ob vious of these is the relief on the back of the palma of which the subject is a blood sacrifice. The depiction of action in relief sculpture and, specifically, of scenes of human sacrifice are characteristically associated with post-classical Mexican cul tures, especially that of the Toltecs in the Valley of Mexico. As mentioned before, the Classic culture of Veracruz seems to have persisted later than elsewhere in Mexico, apparently long enough to have come under the direct influence of foreign post-classical cultures, such as that of the Toltecs. There are formal characteristics of the Cleveland palma-for example, the symmetry of the ornamental scrolls of its chief face which tend to confirm a late date for this piece, probably just prior to the final dissolution of the Classic Veracruz culture about 1200.26 Although less is known about the Classic Veracruz culture than any other American civilization of comparable sophisti cation, the art produced by these people has long been ad mired by specialists and has been sought by collectors. In the case of the realistic human representations in terra cotta from central Veracruz-for example, the Cleveland head (Fig. 1) the nature of their appeal to persons familiar with Western traditions seems obvious. Only rarely, however, do such representations occur in the stone sculptures of northern Veracruz. These sculptures rely instead for their aesthetic impact upon complex decorative patterns which sometimes include realistic details, but in which such details are never the dominant factor in the totality of the design. Curiously enough, close parallels are frequently observable between the decorative motifs of Classic Veracruz stone sculptures and 329</page><page sequence="10">Chinese bronzes of the late Chou Dynasty. For example, Gordon Ekholm pointed out the similarities of design be tween the scrolled patterns of the Cleveland palma and a Chinese bronze vessel.27 Although the relationship in purely visual terms is obvious, it is difficult to explain. It has been hypothesized that peoples of the New World had continued contacts with Asia long after the presumed date of their migra tion from that continent, but the possibility of such contact does not explain how a decorative style which had flourished in China some fifteen hundred years earlier could find reflec tion in the stone sculptures of Veracruz. The parallels are perhaps fortuitous, but they are frequently so close that mere chance seems an unlikely explanation. Might the creators of El Tajin have possessed ancient Chinese bronzes by which they were influenced? Again, it seems unlikely, but not im possible. Whatever the genesis of the style of Classic Veracruz sculpture, the fact that it is comparable in design and quality to bronzes of the Chou Dynasty indicates its aesthetic signi ficance. Within the category of stone sculpture from Veracruz, the yoke and palma now in Cleveland are of very high rank the yoke among the most realistic in detail and carefully finished of its genre and the palma possibly the most complex in composition and exactly executed of all surviving sculptures of its form.
