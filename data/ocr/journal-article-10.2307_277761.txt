The book concludes with an appendix consisting of a number of short excerpts from the writings of Sahagun, Cortez, Stevens, Caso, Stirling, and MacNeish. These passages are followed by eight interesting pages of sketches, by Covarrubias, of Olmec archaeological pieces, ending with his satirical cartoon and verse on the rela- tionship of Olmec to Maya. The major drawback to the book is not the fault of the author: the book was edited for a popular market, and it lacks bibliographic citations. An archaeologist with- out a background in Olmec studies, or students doing research on the Olmec and interested in further pur- suing the new data, will probably be frustrated by this lack. In addition, the only bibliography is a small list of recommended readings, the majority of which do not directly pertain to the textual material. Although the book is a "popular" offering, it discusses and synthesizes a great deal of material. The author's unquestionable expertise in the field of Olmec prehis- tory, his easily readable presentation of the material, to- gether with the numerous anecdotes, excellent illustra- tions, and new theories and data (although uncited), will make this book of interest to anyone with a desire to know more about the New World's first civiliza- tion, the Olmec.

Banco de la Repuib- lica (Bogota, Colombia), Madrid, 1966. xxiii + 377 pp., 113 figs., 310 pls., 30 tables, index. 2 vols. No price given. These two volumes are somewhat late in being re- viewed. However, they should be brought to the atten- tion of archaeologists interested in the development of New World metallurgy, since they represent the culmi- nation of a significant six-volume series on the prehistoric goldwork of Colombia. The volumes being reviewed, like their predecessors by the same author, are primarily based on the more than 10,000 examples of prehistoric metalwork housed in the Museo del Oro del Banco de la Repiiblica of Bogota, Colombia. In addition, items that have been published from other collections are also taken into consideration. These two volumes constitute the report on the analy- sis of the Quimbaya, Darien, Popayan, Sinu, Invasion- ista, and Tairona styles of pre-Columbian metalwork. The text begins with an outline of previous research on the goldwork of the Cauca and Sinfu valleys. Each gold style is considered in a separate section of the text, which is illustrated with line drawings and plates in addition to the many examples of each style pre- sented in the second volume in the form of plates. Each section of the text is composed of a descriptive study, a technological study, a typological description, and a sec- tion on the chronology and relationships of the style under consideration with Colombian and foreign gold styles. The conclusions attempt to place some order into the subject of technological development and abso- lute chronology. Mechanical errors have been kept to a minimum. The large size of these books, 31.5 cm. x 24.5 cm, as well as the subject matter, is reminiscent of the many art books in which pre-Columbian metallurgy is one of the subjects considered. However, Perez de Barradas has con- ducted a rigorous scientific study. He has refined, en- larged, and illustrated the preliminary framework of C. R. Margain (1951, Estudio inicial de las colleciones del Mu- seo del Oro del Banco de la Reputblica. Banco de la Re- puiblica, Bogota) and has given it meaning. The greatest contribution of this study is the classi- fication system that is developed and applied to a large body of data that was simply a large body of unclassified pre-Columbian art prior to this and the preceding works of Perez de Barradas. The styles into which the samples are classified are not rigid narrow categories but, instead, are broad groupings of related samples. Bibliographic sources are given for previously studied samples and, if consulted, illustrate the previous confusion on the clas- sification of Colombian goldwork. Stylistic distinctions are very clear for the anthropomorphic figures except for a few samples that share features of more than one style and which would be difficult to place in any particular style without some reservations. However, the typologies established for zoomorphic figures and jewelry are not as clear, with the major portion of the jewelry being rele- gated to the Invasionista style. Because of the lack of data on provenience for most of the samples used, it is not possible to tell if the differences within a style are due to spatial or temporal factors. Each sample is de- scribed to a greater or lesser extent depending on its complexity. The weight, height, and width of each sam- ple is given in the text, and a four-category chemical analysis (gold, silver, copper ,and other metals and im- purities) is provided for some of the items. The section devoted to chronological aspects is weak, but this results from poorly documented data and is not a reflection of the author's abilities. Although the asso- ciations of many items used by Perez de Barradas are not known, he quotes extensively from the rare reports of treasure hunters when there are any clues which might aid in chronological analysis. This lack of data on proveni- ence prohibits a thorough chronological study based on either relative or absolute dating. Jos6 Perez de Barradas is to be congratulated for the high standards of scholarship maintained in this study, and the Banco de la Repfublica has set an excellent ex- ample by undertaking the financial and administrative burden of publishing these data in such a usable form. Future studies may result in changing some of the clas- sifications made by Perez de Barradas and could possibly show that some of his conclusions on the relationships between styles and dating are incorrect.

CHARLES E. BOLIAN University of Illinois Urbana, Illinois Archaeological Investigations at the Site of El Inga, Ecua, dor. ROBERT E. BELL. Editorial Casa de la Cultura Ecua- toriana, Quito, 1965. 330 pp., 52 figs., 7 pls., 8 tables. $6.00. Both the author and the publisher are to be congratu- lated on this important addition to the literature on the South American preceramic stage. It is a most signifi- cant contribution to the miniscule body of full site reports on that subject, and it must be ranked among the two or three best of them. In a field in which most of the data have been published only in the most preliminary fashion, and in which fuller reports are often more confusing than enlightening, it is a pleasure to encounter simple typolo- gies, intelligible terminology, straightforward descriptions, and full presentation of the evidence. Rarest of all, the illustrations are truly excellent and have been excel- lently reproduced. The report is not without its weaknesses, but they are the fault of the El Inga site itself. The deposit is shal- low, with little visible stratigraphy, and is plagued by mechanical mixture of chronologically distinct materials. There are several preceramic cultural units as well as ceramic stage intrusions. Artifacts from all periods are found in almost every level. By plotting artifact type distributions both horizontally and vertically (in clear graphic presentations imposed on the excavation grid), Bell distinguishes three preceramic units, labeled El Inga I, II, and III, characterized, respectively, by fluted fish- tail points, broad-stemmed and foliate points, and con- tracting-stemmed points. The numbers represent their presumed chronological order. Bell emphasizes that this sequence cannot be substantiated by the stratigraphic data and should be taken as a working hypothesis only (pp. 317-18). It seems to this reviewer that the early position of the fishtail points, relative to other projectile point forms, is substantiated by both internal distributional and external comparative evidence. When El Inga is compared with central Andean sequences, however, an alternate hypo- thesis would be equally consistent with the distributional evidence. The elaborate burin technology (e.g., dihedrals, burins on retouched truncations, side-edge retouch) re- sembles that of such Pleistocene industries as Oquendo and Exacto and is quite out of place in a post-Pleistocene Andean hunting culture. Also, in Peru at least, con- tracting-stem points precede rather than follow the little foliates of Inga II type. One might therefore, without violating the stratigraphy or denigrating Bell's excellent analysis, suggest that the burins and certain of the flake tools represent very old occupational debris mechanically mixed with the projectile points; and that, among the projectile points, the sequence should be: (1) fishtails, (2) broad-stems and contracting-stems, and (3) foliates. Finally, a word of appreciation for the bilingual presen- tation, intelligently arranged in separate sections with identical references to the illustrations that lie between. Many of our colleagues in South America fail to keep up with much recent literature because they do not read English. Similarly, those of us who live and work in the United States often fail to keep up with the latest publi- cations in Spanish by regional and national institutions. Bell's report, and the Casa de la Cultura's handling of it, represent a real bridge across this lamentable chasm. EDWARD P. LANNING Columbia University New York, New York Textiles from Beneath the Temple of Pachacamac, Peru. INA VANSTAN. Museum Monographs, University of Pennsylvania Museum, Philadelphia, 1967. vii + 91 pp., 78 figs., 5 tables. $5.00. Miss VanStan's study of the textiles Max Uhle exca- vated at Pachacamac and deposited at the University of Pennsylvania Museum is a useful and welcome addition to the knowledge of Peruvian textile history. In 1896- 97, Uhle dug an area, amongst others, which he desig- nated as "beneath the temple," although his field catalogue, reproduced as Table 5, indicates that some specimens came from burials at different levels or from a nearby "gravefield." Not all of the specimens were avail- able to Miss VanStan, but the approximately 160 fabrics she has analyzed probably are representative of the whole. Thanks to the descriptions of her meticulous analyses and to the excellent illustrations, one feels as if each fabric were before him. Except for the rarity of double- cloth and gauze, the weaves, colors, and designs are what one might expect from the place and time. No attempt was made in this study to "place" the collections in time, but Mr. Lawrence Dawson tells me that "Pachaca- mac ranges from Early Intermediate Period through Mid- dle Horizon with a heavy over-lay of Inca." The textile ornamentations are often interlocking motifs, whether in pattern-weave or tapestry (see Figs. 10, 19, 28, 29, 55, 72-76). Tiahuanaco-like winged deities appear in a large tapestry piece (Figs. 43-45). Some parallels in techniques or object-forms with textiles (unpublished), which Louis Stumer excavated at Vista Alegre, are noticeable (for example, 1Z-2S as the prevalent spinning order, inter- locked brocade, reinforced tapestry, twill, and scarfs fold- ed diagonally and bordered on the two sewn sides). There seems to have been somewhat more variation in spinning directions than is usual at a single site in Peru. The most frequent directions are 1Z-2S, whether with cotton or wool fibers. Yet in a small group of fabrics, for example (pp. 70-71), are found IS, 1Z-2S, and even 1S-2S. The author has given the yam data for some groups in Tables I-4; those for other specimens are in the text. For purposes of this study, Miss VanStan classified the textiles by their finished forms (such as pouches, poncho shirts, shrouds, etc.), rather than by excavation 497</page></plain_text>
