<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIRACOCHA AS GOD AND HERO IN THE COMENTARIOS REALES THE story of the young prince rejected by his father the king only to become one of the most celebrated heroes of his people's history is a well-known one within the Inca Garcilaso's Comentarios reales de los Incas. The prince-like Moses, his counterpart in an- other sun-worshipping society of an earlier age-is possessed of a temperament so uncontrollable that he must be exiled to tend the flocks in a region far from the center of power. Also like Moses, the Inca prince there experiences a hierophany, or supernatural revelation, which results in the taming of his spirit and the emer- gence of his leadership abilities in the deliverance of his people from a grave danger. In the case of Garcilaso's hero the hier- ophany consists of a meeting with the god Viracocha, who reveals to him that, because of the weakness of his father, Yahuar Huacac, several subjugated peoples are about to overrun Cuzco and destroy the civilization graciously provided by the sun god for the for- merly barbaric peoples of the Andes.1 Though that message is rejected out of hand by the king, who ultimately is forced by the invasion to flee with his decrepit old retainers, his son is able to rally his people and win a great victory, whereupon he establishes new centers of worship and becomes a wise and beloved ruler, even being forced to take the name Viracocha against his will. Richard Callan has revealed in detail how closely the story, as related by Garcilaso, corresponds to the universal hero pattern described by various writers on mythology.2 That is, not only is Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Comentarios reales de los Incas, 2nd ed.

Siem ens the fundamental trajectory of departure, penetration to the source of power, and life-enhancing return easily perceptible, but, as Callan points out, there are also strong echoes of certain primitive theories, familiar to us from The Golden Bough, concerning the re- placement of an old and ineffectual king by a younger and more dynamic man. The question I wish to consider is why this particular transfer- ence of power from a king to his successor becomes such a cata- clysmic event for the society in which it takes place. Surely in an empire as well-structured as that of the Incas it must have been unusual, to say the least, for there to have been such a shaking-up of institutions. Furthermore, it is impossible to pass the episode off as representing a simple coincidence involving a particularly weak father and an especially strong and unruly son, with no fur- ther significance attached. This is doubly true when we note strik- ing parallels between this story and that of the biblical Moses, to the extent that in each case there is even a downgrading of the Sun as prime object of worship in favor of a god claiming to be the creator of all things including the Sun (Comentarios reales, p. 263). I feel that the key lies in the fact that, within the pre-modern cyclical view of time there are temporal units of varying lengths, ranging from the Aztecs' concept of the daily death and rebirth of the cosmos to the cycles of multiple thousands of years charac- teristic of the mythology of the religions of India.3 It is my con- tention that the reason for the general upheaval in the Inca empire at this time is that the society in question is not simply suffering through the trauma of the ritual replacement of a king which might take place every thirty years or so, but is involved in the conclu- sion of a far larger cycle, one involving an indefinite number of kings-perhaps even all of them following the original solar theophany. In those huge courses run by the cosmos in Indian religion, it is stressed that in the beginning all is new, charged with creative power, and astonishingly large in size: it is said that the Buddha at one point was two hundred fifty miles tall (Campbell, The Hero, p. 151). At each stage within the cycle the constituent elements of the cosmos become smaller, weaker, and generally more subject to negative judgments, until at last any further deterioration is 3 Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces (Cleveland-New York, 1956), pp. 262-65. 328 HR, 47 (1979)</page><page sequence="3">Viracocha as God and Hero inconceivable and a major outpouring of creative power reestablishes the titanic dimensions of everything. It appears that this is essentially what happens, on a much smaller scale, in Garcilaso's story. We know at least that the first Inca was supposed to be literally the child of the Sun, and that he was so imbued with creative power that he was able to establish the greatest empire ever known to the people of that region. The act of foundation, in primitive thinking, is tantamount to re-creating the world. Judging by what we know from other cultures about the way in which this principle operates, it seems reasonable to conclude that there has been a gradual degeneration in the rulers- if not in fact, then at least in the telling-and that the process has culminated in Yahuar Huacac, whose birth is attended by the worst of omens and whose name means "weeping blood." When we add to this the fact that a king is commonly thought of as embodying the total being of his people, that name takes on great significance. It is typical of pre-modern cultures to think of blood as equivalent to life, an example being seen in the Odyssey in the extreme anx- iety of the shades of Hades to come into contact with the blood of Odysseus' sacrifice in order to become more substantial in their existence.4 If the essence of a society resides in its king, and the king's life is in his blood, the implication of this name must be that the very life of the people is being gradually drained away. It is for this reason that Garcilaso speaks of "el mal agiiero de su nombre" (Comentarios reales, p. 221), and presents a general pic- ture of fear and foreboding in his depiction of Yahuar Huacac. The entire process is of course analogous to the principle of entropy as described in thermodynamics: in a closed system the energy available at the beginning of a cycle gradually decreases. A corollary is that the movement is inevitably from a higher degree of organization to an increasing randomness-or, stated in another way, chaos. The cure for the intolerable state of affairs resulting near the end of the larger cycle is the new infusion of power which is ex- pected with a return to that point in time which is both the end and the beginning, and the point in space which is the Center where primordial energy surges up from its source. Thus the cosmos is all new and filled with sufficient power to complete an- other cycle. It is here that the hero-figure emerges to act as the channel of the requisite power of creation, and I wish to submit 4 Book XI. 329</page><page sequence="4">William L. Siemens a definition of the hero as an elect being who periodically comes into contact with primordial creative power in order to renew the world. This creative power of which we are speaking is a dynamic force of a very special sort, analogous, I believe, to the mana of the Melanesians. Of them R. H. Codrington says: There is a belief in a force ... which acts in all kinds of ways for good and evil, and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control ... It is a power or influence, not physical, and in a way supernatural; but it shews itself in physical force or in any kind of power or excel- lence which a man possesses. This Mana is not fixed in anything, and can be conveyed in almost anything; but spirits, whether disembodied souls or supernatural beings, have it and can impart it.5 According to Albert B. Friedman, mana has underlying it the no- tion of a divine spirit which permeates the cosmic order, and thus it tends to emerge in theophanies.6 Given these postulates-a world suffering through the final stages of entropic decay, the concept of the hero as agent of the forces of renewal, and that of mana as an expression of that power itself, which tends to emerge in theophanies-we are ready to ex- amine the evolutionary process through which the prince to be known as Viracocha passes, along with the particular cosmos whose essence he embodies as its king. While mana undoubtedly tends to emerge in theophanies, there seems to be another factor in operation which throws a good deal of light not only on this, but on several hero myths. Many heroes of the world's literature and folklore are described as rather wild, unruly characters in their youth. This is true of Moses who im- pulsively kills the Egyptian; it is true of Calder6n's Segismundo (who in any case seems to owe a good deal to Garcilaso's Vira- cocha), and indeed is even prophesied in his case. The apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas even has the child Jesus as an impetuous youngster who slays people who irritate him and otherwise abuses his divine power.7 5 The Melanesians: Studies in Their Anthropology and Folklore (Oxford, 1891), p. 119. 6 Presented in a seminar entitled "Myth, Symbolic Modes and Ideology," at the Claremont Graduate School in the summer of 1976, supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. 7 "Infancy" 19.24, The Apocryphal Books of the New Testament (Phila- delphia, 1890), p. 57.

This need not violate Codrington's prin- ciple that mana "is not fixed in anything," for it may be that it is simply imparted to the appropriate person at birth. Seen an- other way, it should belong to all Inca rulers in some measure, since, according to another point expressed by Codrington, super- natural beings all have it, and of course the Inca is considered divine. As already noted, mana is morally undirected and neutral, and something to be handled with caution. It appears that at the mo- ment chosen for cosmic renewal a higher power-in the case before us a case can be made for either the Sun or the god Viracocha- places on earth an extraordinary being filled with mana. Since it is directionless at this stage, the mana is perceived as dangerous to whatever order remains, particularly since the hero is typically destined to be king and as such is in a position to do great harm. These principles are especially evident in the case of Garcilaso's prince, who is presented as fundamentally an avatar of Viracocha, who appears in Inca mythology as the supreme creator god, above even the Sun. The principle underlying this conception of the prince is one expounded by Mircea Eliade, namely that to the pre- modern mind no individual has any significance in himself; he only becomes "real" insofar as he reproduces the archetypal acts of the hero of his particular culture, performed in illo tempore-that is, in the mythic Instant of creation-and thereby takes on that hero's identity.8 The significant point for our purposes is that the hero who assumes the identity of the creator in effect superimposes the time in which he lives upon the time of the cosmogony, thereby placing his world in the only position in which it can be renewed. In a ritual sense it is the original creation taking place all over again. As an incarnation of the divine creator Viracocha, the prince manifests a prodigious amount of mana; the problem which emerges is that this power has no specific direction until the attainment of a particular form of maturity by the hero. And in the case under Lord Jesus was coming home in the evening with Joseph, he met a boy, who ran so hard against him, that he threw him down; to whom the Lord Jesus said, As thou has thrown me down, so shalt thou fall, nor ever rise. And that moment the boy fell down and died." s Myths, Bites, Symbols (New York, 1975), I, 254. 331</page><page sequence="6">William L. Siemens consideration, as well as those of Moses and Segismundo, the func- tion of the hierophany, far from imparting more mana, is to focus that power or direct it into creative channels. Our hero is thus destined from the beginning to pass through the requisite stages of departure, penetration to the source of power, and to return to save his society in its time of crisis. He is exiled to a place apart from the center of ordinary social inter- actions, and after three years experiences a vision in which none other than the god Viracocha appears to him in order to warn him of the impending attack upon Cuzco by certain subjugated peoples living on the periphery of the empire (Comentarios reales, p. 218). Significantly, they are termed "barbaros," at least in Garcilaso's version (Comentarios reales, p. 224), and the specific threat is that they will bring about a chaotic situation at the very Center of the cosmos and defile that place. It would be well to recall at this point that the word "Cuzco" means "navel," and the Indians of this story are very conscious of their capital's significance as the axis mundi, or navel of the earth; the dreaded act of desecration will bring back the wretched state of affairs which prevailed before the Sun sent his children to teach them his ways of order and civilization. Thus the vision of a weak ruler who, while embodying the essence of his people, first refuses to accept a message from the god because it is mediated through his rejected son and then abandons the very Center of the cosmos to the barbarians, is a terrifying one to his loyal subjects (Comentarios reales, pp. 222-23). It is specifically the ultimate crisis, then (the threat of destruc- tion to the entire world order graciously provided by the Sun) which is able to transform the undirected mana possessed by the prince into a truly creative force capable of turning chaos aside and effecting a new cosmogony. As in many cosmogonic myths, the hero must slay the "dragon" of primordial chaos before he can carry out the act of creation. In many cases that dragon may represent the explosive, uncontrollable character of the mana within the hero himself. Something of this sort underlies certain primi- tive creation stories in which the hero first kills his adversary and then forms a world from his body. That is, if the creator's ad- versary is only a personification of mana as destructive rather than creative power, then, having brought him under control, it is fitting that the creator should be able to use him as the substance of the new cosmos. 332 HER, 47 (1979)</page><page sequence="7">Viracocha as God and Hero Garcilaso's story emphasizes the amount of blood shed on the field of battle. "La batalla, haviendo sido tan reniida que duro mas de ocho horas, fae muy sangrienta; tanto, que dizen los indios, que, demas de la que se derram6 por el campo, corrio sangre por un arroyo seco que passa por aquel llano, por lo cual le llamaron de alli adelante Yahuar Pampa, que quiere dezir campo de sangre" (Comentarios reales, p. 264). In view of the evident meaning of blood as the essence of life this may be a significant point in the development of the cosmogony, since it is largely the blood of the old order, that of the "barbarians" attracted by the entropic state of affairs, which is shed. Then it is from that bloodstained soil, according to the popular legend reported by Garcilaso, that new soldiers spring to come to the aid of the creation which is now in progress (Comentarios reales, p. 262). Furthermore, it is high noon when the newly-created soldiers appear-actually just emerg- ing from their hiding places-thereby demonstrating that the pro- cess has been initiated and supported by the Sun himself. It will be recalled that the hierophany came precisely at high noon as well, at the peak of the Sun's influence (Comentarios reales, p. 218). After the battle the prince is received back in Cuzco, the Center of his world, as its new founder (Comentarios reales, p. 280). This too is significant. As I have already mentioned, Eliade stresses the fact that a new act of founding is the equivalent of a new act of creation.9 It is from here that the prince goes out to the farthest reaches of his empire, bringing words of wisdom, assurance and peace. Again, in primitive thought, to move pur- posefully around an expanse of land is tantamount to taking pos- session of it. The occasion has transformed the only person pos- sessed of enough power to meet it, and everywhere the new Inca is hailed as the savior of his people (Comentarios reales, p. 263). He attempts to refuse the name Viracocha, as I have indicated, even though as Inca he is considered to be divine in at least a gen- eralized way, since he is viewed as a mortal descended from the immortal gods. He prefers the name Pachacuitec, which means "one who turns, or overturns, or changes the world" (Comentarios reales, p. 284). It is not to be: according to Eliade's principles, the popular mind perceives that he has done the deeds associated with the god Viracocha; he has done them in order to effect a new creation, and therefore he is the god in the flesh. 9 The Myth of the Eternal Return (Princeton, 1971), p. 20. 333</page><page sequence="8">William L. Siemens Given Garcilaso's story and what we know of the mythology of the Incas of his time, it is not difficult to see how the mind of what Eliade calls "religious man" made such an identification. In one version of the Inca cosmogony, Viracocha was born of chaos,'0 and it certainly requires no stretching of the imagination to see how this is also true of the prince, who is born when matters are at their worst within the Inca dynasty, in that the evil omens sur- rounding his father's birth are being realized in his weakness as king and in the ensuing rebellion. It is also true that the youthful Viracocha's character itself is ruled by disorder, and that in his emergence as creator of a new order he may be said to have been born of chaos. The chaotic child is father of the creative man. Moreover, having been born out of chaos, the god Viracocha is ready to continue the movement towards order in the universe by creating heavenly bodies, the earth and human beings. Among the many hymns of various types to the god is an haylle in which he is addressed as "God, origin of the Universe, / Creator of all," and in another typical ritual poem he is "creator of the world . . . / creator of man" (Arias-Larreta, Pre-Columbian Literatures, pp. 67, 74), and still another places him in a more sophisticated theological framework as " causa del ser. " 1l More exactly, he is seen as having created mankind from the stones of the earth: "En el asiento de Tiahuanaco hace de la piedra cierto numero de gente y un principal que la gobernara y senoreara . . A continuacion de esta escena crea el Sol, las estrellas y la luz. E1 mito nos presenta luego a Viracocha y sus subordinados dando vida a los hombres en cada provincia . . ." 12 One more element in the mythification process culminating in the identifica- tion of the prince with this god can of course be perceived im- mediately: the fact that in the great battle the reserve troops sprang into the fray in such a startling manner that the legend grew up that the stones had become men, and although Garcilaso fails to make the connection, the implication for the Inca mind would certainly be that it is the prince's creative energy which has brought about the metamorphosis. Garcilaso quotes Padre o1 Abraham Arias-Larreta, Pre-Columbian Literatures. I: History of Indoamerican Literature (n.p., 1964), p. 75. 11 Jesis Lara, La poesia quechua (Mexico, 1947), p. 73. 12 Augusto Tamayo Vargas, Literatura peruana (Lima, 1953), I, 69. 334 HR, 47 (1979)</page><page sequence="9">Viracocha as God and Hero Jeronimo Roman as saying that certain stones were pointed out as being the ones which had become soldiers (Comentarios reales, p. 281); it is also told of the god that he sometimes turned people back into stone, though normally this act seems to have constituted some sort of punishment (Tamayo Vargas, Literatura peruana, p. 70). This belief in the emergence of mankind from the stones of the Andes, along with the reversibility of the process, can be ap- propriately related to the important position held in Inca religion by the magnificent stone worship center at Machu Picchu. Man could hardly be more at one with his place of worship than in these circumstances. One also wonders whether the celebrated mortarless but tightly-fitted stonework of Inca buildings and walls symbolizes the equally tight structure of their society. There is a firm belief in Viracocha as the "Ground of Being," the creator of the Sun, man and the earth with which he works. And therein, I believe, lies a key to Garcilaso's otherwise some- what puzzling interpolation of a lengthy passage on Peruvian agriculture and administrative questions, squarely in the midst of the story of the prince who was to become Viracocha. His,own comment is, "Y porque el Inca Yahuar Huacac, cuya vida escri- vimos, no reino mas de hasta aqui, como adelante veremos, me parescio cortar el hilo desta historia para dividir sus hechos de los de su hijo, Inca Viracocha, y entremeter otras cosas del govierno de aquel Imperio y variar los cuentos, por que no sean todos de un prop6sito" (Comentarios reales, p. 224). When he speaks of his intention, "dividir sus hechos de los de su hijo," and then provides for the reader a treatise on Inca administration-which of course is fundamentally agricultural administration-one gains a definite impression that the mythic mind is at work unconsciously in this son of an Inca princess. In any case it seems entirely fitting that two worlds so radically different from each other should be separated by a discussion of the way in which man relates to the world which is about to be renewed. He appears to be saying, "Here are the telluric processes on which our lives have depended for many centuries. Let me tell you about them before I con- clude the story of the king which my people feel brought new vitality to the earth." 335</page><page sequence="10">William L. Siemens There is also a significant, implicit shift in ideology in the ac- ceptance of the Inca ruler as an incarnation of Viracoeha. Whereas the foundational identity principle affecting the ruler has him as a direct descendant of the Sun, Viracocha, as noted above, was quite commonly viewed as the creator of the Sun itself. Garcilaso somewhat vehemently denies this at every opportunity, protesting that the Indians simply adjusted their mythology to please the Spaniards, but it seems highly unlikely that such a body of hymn- ody as that to which I have referred could have been developed in the years between Pizarro's arrival and Garcilaso's writing, solely for the purpose of currying favor with the conquerors. These hymns have a flavor of genuine devotion to them, and of some antiquity. More likely than Garcilaso's view, in my opinion, is the belief that there was some conflict between popular piety and the priestly caste, as there often is in such a society, and that the latter had succeeded in convincing Garcilaso, at least, that theirs was the primitive view, so that when the other belief surfaced it could be put down as innovation. If I am correct in this, then in Viracocha Inca the status of the kingship for these people has been raised a considerable degree, and the power of the priesthood correspondingly lowered; for while homage is still duly paid to the Sun, the close identity of this king with the god whose name he bears carries with it some strong implications. Garcilaso makes a remarkable statement in this re- gard: "Y assi le hazian la veneracion y acatamiento con nuevas y mayores ostentaciones de adoracion que a sus passados, como que en el huviesse nueva y mayor deidad que en ellos . . . Qued6 acordado que los adorassen ambos igualmente, y que, nombrando a cualquiera dellos, pues tenian un mismo nombre, se entendiesse que los nombravan a ambos" (Comentarios reales, p. 270). No clearer reflection of Eliade's principles could be found. As the understanding must have worked out in practice, the common people in singing their hymns to Viracocha as creator of all things would have thought of their king in that role. The god Viracocha is known to Inca tradition for his strong action in putting down rebellion. Tamayo Vargas quotes Sarmiento de Gamboa as saying that the people created by Viracocha "tras- pasaron el precepto de Viracocha; que cayendo, por esta trasgre- si6n, en la indignacion, los confundio y maldijo . . . y sobre 336 HR, 47 (1979)</page><page sequence="11">Viracocha as God and Hero todo les envio un diluvio general en el cual murieron casi todos" (Tamayo Vargas, Literatura peruana, p. 71). Again, as the people watched this prince miraculously put down a rebellion by the barbarians from the fringes of his empire it was inevitable that they should relate the act to that of their supreme god. Finally, as I have noted, having established order at the mythic Center of the renewed cosmos, the new Inca once more imitates the god by going out to the various provinces of his empire to bring words of forgiveness and encouragement; his namesake, it will be recalled, is seen in the myth as "dando vida a los hombres en cada provincia." One of the most impressive points about his behavior during that excursion, according to Garcilaso, is the fact that there are no reprisals against the rebels (Comentarios reales, pp. 264-65, 277-80), for although the god is known for his severity in carrying out the action necessary to crush a rebellion, "Viracocha se distingue por su munificencia y por su mansedumbre . . . No conoce la ira ni sabe castigar" (Lara, La poesia, p. 73). So the circle is complete: wherever he has gone and whatever he has done has been perceived by the people as the reproduction of the deeds of their creator. The prince born of chaos has de- feated the forces which would have driven the world back into that state. In so doing he has cleared the way for the restoration of the cosmos and of order throughout the realm. It is inevitable that he should be forced to take the name of the god as he has as- sumed his cosmic role, and that the name Pachacuftec should be reserved for his son (Comentarios reales, p. 304; but see Tamayo Vargas, Literatura peruana, p. 106). When the story of Viracocha is compared with that of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, some striking points of both similarity and con- trast are noted. Quetzalcoatl is conceived as "el dios que trans- forma la muerte en vida . . . lo instintivo en civilizado," 3 and he is also similar to the god Viracocha in that he is traditionally represented as "a white-haired old man with a long beard dressed in a full robe." 14 He too experiences a profound inner struggle between the tendencies towards life and death, and between love and hate (Diaz, Quetzalcoatl, p. 29), and this culminates in the departure from both chastity and justice of the god-king who is 13 Fernando Diaz Infante, Quetzalc6atl (Mexico, 1963), p. 25. 14 New Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology (New York, 1959), p. 437. 337</page><page sequence="12">William L. Siemens noted for bringing the instincts under control. In his case too, the forces representing chaos force the abandonment of the Center of the cosmos (which for the Aztecs is Tula) with the palace guard (Diaz, Quetzalcoatl, p. 48), though the enemy here, rather than an invading army, is a pair of sorcerers who use mirrors to force Quetzalcoatl to acknowledge his corruption and go into exile. The significant point of difference in the Quetzalcoatl story is the degeneration of the world as embodied by its king, which re- sults not in the replacement of that king by a son who has been transformed in exile, but in the exile of the king himself as he departs in search of wisdom. In one version of the myth he ar- rives at the edge of the Eastern sea and sets himself afire, thereby becoming the planet Venus: "Es fama que . . . se instalo a reinar" (Diaz, Quetzalcoatl, p. 53), but now he reigns from the heavens. In the better-known version of the myth-better-known perhaps because the arrival of Cortes related to it so dramatically-Quet- zalcoatl sets sail towards the east after promising the people to return (New Larousse, p. 437). The essential point of unity between the two figures lies in the fact that each, although the supreme anthropomorphic figure in the mythology of his people, is viewed as being unable to conquer the forces of destructive passion within himself and in the king- dom until he has retired to the place of power in search of wisdom and self-control. Viracocha is transformed by means of a theoph- any, while Quetzalcoatl is purified by fire. It can readily be seen that Garcilaso's story is really one deal- ing with the Incas' views of time and power-time because it relates to the crisis which results when a large temporal cycle comes to an end, and power because it presents the reader with the way in which the requisite power of creation becomes incar- nate in a prince, is misunderstood, and ultimately is channeled in such a manner that the cosmos may be renewed. In this respect the story of Prince Viracocha is not only the narration of a hero's feats, but of the salvation and renewal of an entire social and cultural order; as such it provides a striking illustration of Octavio Paz's statement that the destiny of heroes "est6a enlazado con el de los dioses y con la salud misma del cosmos." 15 WILLIAM L.
