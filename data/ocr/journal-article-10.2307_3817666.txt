<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Ask the Beasts, and They Shall Teach Thee": The Human Lessons of Charles Willson Peale's Natural History Displays DAVID R. BRIGHAM hrough the display and interpretation of natural history specimens, Charles Willson Peale expressed his belief that animal behavior pro- vided a model for an economically productive, socially harmonious, and morally upright republic. From the distance of two centuries, we recognize such a model as thoroughly cultural-that is, constructed by humans to serve human interests. Peale transformed nature for cultural purposes in a number of different ways and with a variety of tools, including the rifle, the scalpel, the needle, the paintbrush, and the pen. He hunted, gutted, and stuffed animals, and arranged these specimens in lifelike poses; he then painted habitat settings in which to display them; and he wrote labels, catalogues, and lectures to in- terpret them. One of Peale's central ideas was that nature is simultaneously hierarchical and harmonious, and by means of his displays he extended this construction of nature to human life. A republic that was at once rank-ordered and cooperative would be optimally satisfying, abundant, and wholesome. Peale and his followers promoted this social and political set of ideas not only as natural but also as the expression of God's will. COLLECTING SPECIMENS When Charles Willson Peale opened his "Repository for Natural Curiosities" in 1786, he was adding nature as a category of display to that of art.1 Up until this time, Peale had exhibited his portraits in oil of Revolutionary War heroes, transparent paintings of local landscapes and scenes from Milton's Paradise 1.

The long exhibition hall is shown, its cases filled with preserved bird specimens arranged in an orderly gridlike pattern (fig. 1). Contemporary guidebooks state that Peale had accumulated about eleven hundred bird specimens-along with hundreds of quadrupeds, fish, reptiles, insects, minerals, and shells-by the time this por- trait was painted. Peale himself estimated that the collections contained over eighteen hundred birds and more than a hundred thousand objects total by this time.3 Peale developed his collections by two means: by soliciting and receiving donations of specimens; and by hunting birds and other animals. As shown in the detail taken from the left margin of The Artist in His Museum, Peale acknowledges the importance of donations for the growth of his collections (fig. 2). The specimen featured in this elongated case is a paddlefish, and the inscription proclaims that it is the gift of Robert Patterson, a prominent professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Peale encouraged such contribu- tions by publishing lists of recent acquisitions and the names of their donors in Philadelphia's newspapers.4 Such notices also served, of course, to announce the expansion of his collection. Peale appealed to individual donors and recognized their assistance privately with printed gift acknowledgments on which an alle- gorical figure pulls back the curtain to reveal the wonders of nature, just as Peale does in his self-portrait (fig. 3). Through gifts to the museum, donors demon- strated their shared interest in educating citizens of the new republic; they, too, were capable of pulling back the veil of ignorance. The motto in the gift acknowledgment, "Of grains are Mountains form'd," indicates that Peale amassed his substantial collection from individual contributions-and suggests his belief in an analogy between his enterprise and natural processes. The appeals for specimens were responded to by a wide range of in- dividuals, from merchants who traded in foreign ports to members of ex- ploration parties and eminent naturalists. When Robert Morris's ship Alliance returned from China in 1788, this wealthy merchant donated a silver pheasant 2. See, for example, Independent Gazetteer, 21 May 1785, where an advertisement describes a view of a country seat from night to dawn and in full daylight; a street at evening, then at night lit by street lamps; a "grand piece of architecture" in rain and then with rainbow; a representation of Milton's Pandemonium; and a mill near the falls of the Schuylkill. These scenes were transparent pictures with "changeable effects," modeled on the theatrical pictorial displays presented in London by Philip James de Loutherbourg. 3.

He frequently ventured into the woods and fields and on the river banks and beaches near Philadelphia, and he occasionally made trips as far as Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. In the late 1780s, the first years of the museum's operation, Peale's attention was still chiefly consumed by his business as a por- traitist. Nonetheless, when he traveled by horse-drawn chaise through Mary- land in 1789, painting watercolor-on-ivory miniatures and oil paintings for patrons there, he recorded in his diary that he had collected about sixty birds for the museum.8 During the 1790s, Peale finally turned his attention fully to the business of building and managing the museum.9 Peale's diary entries show that the trips to Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey now focused on hunting ani- mals for the displays. 5.

BRIGHAM Whereas records of donations distance the collector from the kill, Peale's diary makes concrete the role of the gun in gathering specimens. In 1793 Peale sailed for Cape Henlopen, Delaware, with his wife Elizabeth, infant son Vandyke, and the first Titian, then thirteen and already his museum assis- tant.10 On 22 August, during a stop on Pea Patch Island, Peale "went ashore and shot a number of small Birds." Two days later, "a considerable number of Mother Carrys Chickens came round the Vessel and we shot 5 of them, we might have taken many more of them but this number were sufficient for my purpose." Titian, also skilled with his rifle, "shot a flood Gull &amp; a White Crain &amp; some Plover" on 27 August. Two days later, the father-and-son team bor- rowed a flat-bottom boat and hired two boys to row for them, and they "shot ... willets, mud hens, Curlews, Gull &amp;c. Peale coordinated trips to locations known to be rich in desirable species of birds. He was assisted by his sons Raphaelle and Titian, as well as by a slave, a wage laborer, and local youths who worked as day laborers. Together they hiked, rowed boats, and shot animals. It was thus not only a personal blow but also a significant professional setback when Titian died in 1798 at age eighteen.11 He had been a promising natural- ist and Peale's principal assistant both at the museum and on expeditions. Peale then had to find additional personnel. The diary records that on 30 May 1799, Peale sailed for Cape May, New Jersey, with Jotham Fenton and Moses Williams.12 Fenton was a mechanic, skilled in taxidermy and other arts useful to a museum keeper, whom Peale had hired away from the New York Museum a few years earlier. Moses Williams was Peale's slave, referred to in his diary as "my Molatto Man Moses." That hunting was the standard way to gather specimens is indicated not only in Peale's private diary but also in many public contexts. For example, he requested in a 1787 advertisement: "Mr. Peale's respectful compliments to the gentlemen sportsmen of Philadelphia, and [he] will be obliged to them for such birds and Beasts as are not yet preserved in Mr. Peale's Museum."13 Mark Catesby, in the preface to his Natural History of Carolina, had earlier acknowl- edged the importance of the hunt to the practice of natural history. With Native Americans as his guides, Catesby hunted birds, buffalo, bears, panthers, "and other wild Beasts."14 Both Peale and Catesby described hunting activi- 10.

BRIGHAM</page><page sequence="8">CHARLES WILLSON PEALE'S NATURAL HISTORY DISPLAYS ties in a matter-of-fact tone, and they were apparently untroubled by the con- tradiction in killing specimens to display or depict them as though living. The Romantic artist and naturalist, however, developed an uneasiness about shoot- ing that had not troubled their Enlightenment predecessors. For example, John James Audubon's writings reveal his ambivalence about killing the creatures he loved, but he also strove to romanticize his role as collector, characterizing him- self as "the American woodsman."15 In his watercolor The Golden Eagle (fron- tispiece), he presents himself (dressed in buckskin, precariously straddling a tree that bridges a rocky gulf) as a predator who, like the eagle who must kill to survive, commits violence for the "sustenance" of science and art. TAXIDERMY A vital concern among eighteenth-century naturalists was the development of a method to preserve specimens from rotting and from destruction by insects. Collectors insisted, further, that a successful mount should recreate the appearance and characteristics of a living animal. Some scientific writers, in the language they used to describe the reanimation of specimens, even con- flated human and animal qualities. Peale fully embraced the anthropocentric approach to taxidermy, and he employed it to advance the museum's lessons that republican economic, social, and political life ought to follow the exam- ple of nature. Peale's diaries from his collecting trips demonstrate that he hunted and preserved specimens nearly simultaneously. During his 1793 trip to Cape Henlopen, he noted that, shortly after shooting five "Mother Carrys Chick- ens," "Titian &amp; myself set to work and dressed two of the Birds."16 Several days later, they began the day by gutting two birds. (Then they ate breakfast.) Titian later shot several birds, "the mounting of which keep us busey the remaining part of the day." Later in the course of the same trip, Peale sent Titian out hunting by himself and stayed behind to dissect and treat the birds that his son brought back each day. 15. My reading of Audubon derives from Amy R. W. Meyers, "Observations of an American Woodsman: John James Audubon as Field Naturalist," in Annette Blaugrund and Theodore E. Stebbins Jr., eds., John James Audubon: The Watercolorsfor "The Birds ofAmerica" (New York, 1993), 43-54; and from Linda Dugan Partridge, "Domestic Violence: Scientific Themes and Audubon's Rattlesnake Attacked by Mockingbirds" (paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Studies Association, 6 November 1992); and Partridge, "The Construction of the Artist-Naturalist: Audubonography' (paper presented at the annual meeting of the College Art Association, 4 February 1993). 16.

BRIGHAM In the eighteenth century, collectors often consulted manuals for advice on how to preserve the fish, reptiles, birds, and quadrupeds they hunted. Instruc- tions were also published as broadsheets, in handbooks directed at would-be naturalists, in scientific journals, and in travel accounts.17 Writers of such advice addressed themselves both to their peers at home and to correspondents far afield who had access to animals in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Storing specimens in spirits was one method suggested to prevent rotting. These fluids served as effective preservatives but did not make it possible to regain the appearance of a living specimen, and therefore most naturalists preferred to gut their specimens. A manual written by ltienne Francois Turgot and published in Paris in 1758 advocated skinning an animal rather than immersing it in spirits, and the plates demonstrated the operation.18 Others suggested the additional precaution of baking the carcasses at a low temperature to burn the fat off the skin gradually. To preserve their lifelike appearance, Peale, too, gut- ted his specimens, and he did so soon after killing them. Hunting on a creek with Titian, Peale recorded in his diary that their boat ran aground, leaving them temporarily stranded. "That we might save the birds from spoiling," Peale wrote, "I took the bowels &amp; brains out, and put some bur[n]t allum in those places."19 Insects were a constant threat to collections. Peale complained to his audi- ence in a 1792 newspaper address that "his labours herein have be[en] great, and disappointments many; especially respecting proper methods of preserv- ing dead animals from the ravage of moths and worms."20 Storage in spirits, while effective, destroyed the appearance of the specimen, as noted above. Baking, used to prevent rotting initially, could be repeated occasionally to destroy insects and their eggs. Naturalists also experimented with various chemical treatments of skins. Collectors were advised to sprinkle animals with alum and other salts, but these substances caused discoloration and deteriora- tion of the skin. Tobacco, cinnamon, pepper, and a variety of strong spices were tried, but these proved ineffective. Finally, the use of poisons, including arsenic and sublimate of mercury, was proposed. Although Peale frequently 17.

BRIGHAM 190 ~</page><page sequence="10">CHARLES WILLSON PEALE'S NATURAL HISTORY DISPLAYS complained about the inadequacies of published methods, he typically treated the skin and feathers, or fur, with a solution containing arsenic.21 Once spoilage and infestation were averted, the next challenge was to reconstruct the specimen's lifelike appearance. In fact, this concern affected the prescribed manner of the kill as well. Tesser Samuel Kuckahn cautioned readers of the Philosophical Transactions to use gunshot of as small a gauge as possible to limit damage.22 Similarly, John Reinhold Foster, in his Catalogue oftheAnimals ofNorth America, advised collectors of quadrupeds to take care that "the hair of the fur [is] as little stained with blood as possible."23 Various scientific publica- tions, including taxidermy manuals, suggested methods for preserving a living appearance. In the Philosophical Transactions, Rene-Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur advised putting feathers "into their natural Order," to make the spec- imen "appear as it was when it was alive."24 John Lettsom argued the impor- tance of installing "eyes as near the natural ones as possible."25 To reproduce the original form of the animal after gutting, specimens were stuffed with cotton, oakum (hemp compounded with tar), straw, hay, wool, flax, or other soft mate- rials. Turgot's manual proposes the use of cotton to fill the cavities of the abdomen and head (fig. 4). Wire was recommended for holding legs, wings, and head in characteristic poses.26 Peale stuffed small birds with cotton but filled large birds with oakum because of its greater stiffness. For quadrupeds, Peale drew upon his skill as a sculptor and carved forms in wood to replicate their limbs and musculature.27 Peale prided himself on his skill as a taxidermist, and he incorporated his ability to restore a vibrant appearance to a dead animal into the narrative of The Artist in His Museum.28 In the left foreground, Peale included a limp 21.

Above and behind the turkey are cases filled with com- pleted specimens, each of which stands erect. Their heads turn, lift, or bow slightly; their feet are set apart, one foot advanced a step in front of the other. Each specimen stands as if caught in a position held momentarily, no two spec- imens posed quite alike. If we follow directly up the left side of the canvas, we come to Peale's bald eagle-or white-headed eagle, as he preferred to call it- one of the few specimens from the collection that has survived. The eagle is perched as though waiting, prepared in a moment to spring powerfully into the air and to claim the prey of the fishing hawk. In his public lectures, Peale described the eagle, suggesting that he mounted it in profile to feature its watchful eye: It is a mild bird, and unless provoked by hunger never injures other animals.... A curious trait in the character of this Eagle is its watching the fishing Hawk, which is seen hovering over the water seeking for food, and after catching a Fish and rising into the air with it, the Eagle, from his superior strength and flight, immediately darts on the Hawk, who in fright lets go his prey, and then the Eagle, with surprising velocity catches the fish before it falls into the water. The strength of the Eagles Eye is really astonishing.29 Peale shared this interest in capturing a natural appearance with contem- porary naturalists. Mark Catesby, for instance, proclaimed the importance of drawing living birds so that he could seize their characteristic "gestures,"30 and he used plants (which he also insisted on drawing from life) to enhance such a depiction. In the "Little Sparrow and Purple Bind-Weed," from the first vol- ume of Natural History of Carolina, Catesby represented the bird's flexibility and dexterity in gathering insects from the plants around which it lives (fig. 5). Compositionally, the swirling pattern of the bindweed contributes to the sense of motion captured in the bird's twisting, leaning form. By contrast, in the "Yellow Rump" a dead specimen is carefully presented as immobile. Catesby drew the bird suspended from the plant above by a fine strand tied around its foot (fig. 6).31 29.

BRIGHAM Kuckahn offered elaborate directions and justifications for reconstructing a specimen to look as if it were still alive: Without a proper attention to this, however sound your preservation, how vivid soever the plumage may be, your birds are still nothing but meer dead birds; but by a skilful manage- ment of attitudes and actions, you, as it were, animate them, they seem alive, moving and acting .... Picking, stretching, feeding, fear, surprize, and fighting, afford peculiar and strik- ing attitudes.... Great attention should always be had to the poize of the body: in such positions as a live bird may be sup- posed to continue some time in, we must take care that the body appears in equilibrium; on the contrary, in fighting and other violent actions, where a forceable motion is to be given, the appearance of equilibrium must be as carefully avoided, for it always conveys the idea of stillness.32 (Italics added.) In arguing that specimens be reanimated, many naturalists used words like "character," "attitude," and "gesture" that linked animal displays to human qualities. The taxidermist's art was thus associated with the representation of the human face and figure: the art of the sculptor and portraitist. Turning again to The Artist in His Museum, we see that the palette and brushes demon- strate Peale's role as portraitist just as the turkey carcass and tool kit evoke his capacity as taxidermist. Peale's portraits of statesmen and men of letters in the museum stand as parallel expressions to his ornithological character studies. Peale believed that in preserved natural history specimens as well as in portraits of humans, physiognomy conveyed information about the inner character.33 This belief formed the foundation for building a museum to explicate a nat- ural economy and a social structure fit for a thriving republic. 32.

BRIGHAM</page><page sequence="16">CHARLES WILLSON PEALE'S NATURAL HISTORY DISPLAYS ARRANGEMENT AND DISPLAY Peale's next step was to create environments that reflected natural habitats. For example, Peale and his assistants painted landscapes to serve as a background for birds displayed in glass cases. In July 1788, for instance, Peale recorded in his diary, "Grinding [water]colours . . . &amp; painting a Landscape in the Bird case with the assistance of my Brother [James] and the latter part of the day untill late placing the Birds in the same."34 Peale painted such backgrounds throughout the museum's operation, and as late as 1815 he wrote to his son Rubens that he was completing the last landscape for his new installation. Unfortunately, these backgrounds have not survived. In the early years of the museum's operation, Peale preferred elaborate three-dimensional habitat settings. At the end of his first year in business, Peale wrote to his longtime friend and supporter John Beale Bordley, describing the progress of his efforts: the "ducks &amp; Drakes ... I have disposed in Various atti- tudes on ... Artificial ponds, some Birds &amp; Beasts on trees and some Birds sus- pended as flying."35 Contemporary travel accounts attest to the visual impact of the completed display. Historian, minister, and gentleman-naturalist Manasseh Cutler was impressed by the range of Peale's specimens. He described a group of trees on a mound that descended into a pond. Thickets of grass, mineral speci- mens, and soils offered a variety of settings for the preserved animals. Quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, and fish were arranged on the branches, in the grass, on rocks, and in and around the artificial body of water. The display min- gled native and exotic species in a compressed setting that emphasized the vari- ety of animals found in nature and the range of environments that nurture them. For Cutler the display was "romantic and pleasing" and evoked for him an image of Noah's Ark.36 Peale gradually reoriented this eclectic exhibition to exemplify two hierarchical schemes, the Linnaean classification of species and the Great Chain of Being. Application of the first helped Peale gain credibility within the scientific com- munity, while the second furthered Peale's interest in presenting a view of the 34.

BRIGHAM animal kingdom and society as rank-ordered yet interdependent. This arrange- ment is evident in The Artist in His Museum (see fig. 1). Using Linnaeus as his guide, Peale rearranged the specimens into classes, orders, genera, and species.37 In the wall of birds, shown on the left side of the painting, for instance, Peale began his display by laying out the species of raptors, including the eagle. Peale's displays, taken together, demonstrated his belief in the intricate interdependencies among species. All of the basic tenets of the Great Chain of Being-plenitude, continuity, and gradation, in Arthur 0. Lovejoy's formula- tion-were clearly represented. Peale demonstrated the plenitude of nature, its perfection as evident in the variety of forms, in the attempt to represent it exhaustively, and in his perpetual expansion of displays. At the same time, according to the principle of continuity, these abundant forms were ordered as if on a continuum, with each link established by slight variation from the next. The regularity of the twenty-four-by-twenty-inch portraits and the frames that divided the natural history cases contributed formally to the representation of continuity and gradation among species. Each rectangle reserved a space to be occupied by an animal along the continuum. Furthermore, for adherents of the theory, as Lovejoy argued, distinctions of form and purpose explained the position of the links. Peale grouped bats with quadrupeds but placed them over the door leading into the room exhibiting birds.38 The leap from birds to quadrupeds was in fact gradual, demonstrated by animals that shared the attributes of each. The idea that hierarchy is universal, natural, and good had great signifi- cance for ordering individuals according to gender, race, and socioeconomic rank.39 In one of Peale's advertisements, the anthropomorphic presentation of the orangutan's pose and visage (fig. 7) suggests its place beside humans in the natural continuum.40 "How like an old Negro?" Peale asked rhetorically.41 In other words, the unequal social position of blacks and whites reflected a nat- ural distinction that was necessary to explain the gradations between humans and apes. For Peale, the principles of the Great Chain of Being applied within the human species, not simply across species. The human species existed in abundant variety, each individual occupying a natural position within a social 37. On Peale's use of Linnaeus, see Miller, Selected Papers, 1:517 n. 121. 38. Arthur O.

Men and women; refined, middling, and lower sorts; white, black, and Indian-each belonged to a minutely graded, interdependent system. HARMONY AND HIERARCHY In catalogues, lectures, newspaper articles, and label text, Peale elucidated the republican implications of this natural system for his audience. Animals were described as useful to humanity as an economic resource, providing food, clothing, and labor; but also and more importandy as a political model. The interdependence of species as well as forms of behavior typical of each species suggested a natural model of harmony and hierarchy upon which to form republican society.42 That is, animals were both below humans in a system mankind could best manipulate and alongside humans in a system mankind should then interpret for its own edification. Peale's lectures on natural history were delivered in the winter of 1799-1800 and again the following year. He then condensed the lectures into the form of a manuscript catalogue called "A Walk through the Philadelphia Museum," in which the narrator guides visitors from case to case through the exhibition rooms. The lectures and catalogue disclose yet another type of text Peale used to address the public, for they occasionally quote inscriptions Peale placed on the walls, as do the accounts written by visitors and supporters. Finally, reaching beyond the bounds of the museum, Peale published essays in Philadelphia's newspapers on natural history and on the technological im- provements-a more efficient stove, a better bridge-shown in his displays. The abundance of nature predicted the future wealth of the American republic, and the museum taught ways to convert those resources. Foxes, ermine, bears, and muskrats all provided valuable furs (see "A Walk," pp. 19, 23, 24, and 30). Cloth could be woven from the hair of the llama (p. 35) and the buffalo (p. 40). Ducks, pheasants, and turkeys were identified as particu- larly delicious game birds, and bear and buffalo meat were also pronounced appetizing (pp. 82, 24, 40).43 Peale favored the domestication of many species. The ox earned high praise as the "support of husbandry and the strength of Agriculture" (pp. 39-40). The buffalo, larger and faster than the ox, promised 42.

BRIGHAM</page><page sequence="20">CHARLES WILLSON PEALE'S NATURAL HISTORY DISPLAYS to be a superior draft animal (p. 40). Other animals helped the American farmer without having to be trained. Owls depleted poultry stocks, but they also killed rats (p. 46). Grackles fed on many insects, worms, and reptiles that destroyed crops; the corn they also consumed was a small price to pay for elim- inating these other pests (p. 57). When Peale described the behavior of animals as suggestive of ideal human social organization, he attributed human traits, usually positive ones, to dozens of species. While Peale recognized negative characteristics-vanity, obstinacy, and indiscretion-among some animals, he far more often identified their redeeming qualities (pp. 9, 35, 82). Peale understood nature to embody an essentially co- operative rather than a competitive existence. Relationships within and across species exhibited for Peale a natural harmony, one to be emulated by American society both domestically and publicly. A brief list of praiseworthy traits and the animals that possess them suggests Peale's hopes for promoting accord in the home. The mongoose and coatimondi were notably playful, and the macaw was good-humored (pp. 21, 49). The dog was, of course, faithful (p. 18). The Indian musk and the entire genus of corvus, consisting of crows and jays, were recog- nized as sociable, while monkeys, cockatoos, and swans were described as affec- tionate (pp. 36, 53, 10, 49, 81). Some species were admired for their motherly attention to their offspring, including apes, sloths, seals, oppossums, and pelicans (pp. 9, 12, 17, 25, 90). The nuthatch was singled out among birds as exemplary of marital affection (pp. 70-71). Adding a nationalist dimension to these anthro- pomorphic observations, Peale noted the faithfulness of the American cuckoo in contrast to the European species. The Old World female cuckoo gained a reputa- tion for infidelity, perpetuated by the word cuckold, by laying her eggs in another bird's nest. By contrast, Peale claimed, "the American Cuckow... build their own nest... [and] foster their young;-they diligently chant their soft notes to swee- ten the care of incubation and we are proud to believe that they are faithful and constant to each other" (p. 60). Peale's vision of social harmony focused upon animals that were, he claimed, gentle by nature.44 Peale singled out the talapoin among monkeys for its "extremely gentle manners." From such behavior by individuals followed enor- mous social rewards; Peale claimed "that it not only gives peace and comfort to the possessor, but distributes happiness all around; It disarms the passionate; puts an end to strife and its baneful consequences and sometimes arrests the 44. Richard Bushman demonstrates the importance of manners in defining American gentility from the early colonial period to the end of nineteenth century. Bushman's analysis suggests that manners simultaneously promoted ease of address and social hierarchy; see The Refinement ofAmerica: Persons, Houses, Cities (New York, 1993). - 201</page><page sequence="21">202 DAVID R. BRIGHAM direful purposes of Madmen."45 Animals that feed on grass, especially ruminat- ing animals, exhibited a natural capacity toward a gentle disposition. But even carnivorous animals were made violent only by hunger, Peale proposed. Despite their reputation for ferocity, the cougar, the wolf, and the fox were grouped together as gentle animals ("A Walk," p. 19).46 The bear was the exception that proved the rule, and Peale characterized it as not only "savage" and but also "solitary," suggesting that its violence was a function of its distance from civi- lization and society.47 More than a vision of social harmony, this also would seem to be a republican formulation of power: while different species possess greater or lesser ability to overpower one another, Peale admired the restraint of animals that do not wield force wantonly. Clearly, predatory animals posed the greatest challenge to Peale's natural model of social harmony, but his treatment of the eagle suggests a resolution of this problem. His representation of the eagle stands in marked contrast to that of other naturalists. Peale's mount, as depicted in The Artist in His Museum, suggests a system of interdependent species (see fig. 2); whereas Audubon's watercolor (frontispiece), for example, depicts a violent struggle between two species. Recall that the implied narrative of Peale's exhibit is that the eagle is waiting for a hawk to catch a fish, after which the two birds will compete for the prey.48 But these are not the only layers in the system. The king bird chal- lenges both eagles and hawks, Peale writes, and "thus he may be considered the protector of our Poultry" ("A Walk," p. 48). In Audubon's understanding of nat- ural economy, the outcome seems inevitable, whereas Peale proposes a check against the power of the great predators. In another exhibit featuring an eagle, Peale took a step further in asserting that powerful animals need not destroy weaker ones. In 1797 he advertised "a singular association" between a rooster and an eagle (although the museum was best known for its preserved speci- mens, Peale also maintained a menagerie of living animals). The chicken, "since the death of its own species, has deserted its wonted cage, and regularly roosts, each night, with one of the Eagles;-This fact is astonishing-as, the Eagle is well known to be the greatest enemy to poultry."49 45.

BRIGHAM 202</page><page sequence="22">CHARLES WILLSON PEALE'S NATURAL HISTORY DISPLAYS In his writing as in his museum, Peale made the case that every animal was ideally suited to its position within the continuum of the Great Chain of Being. Peale repeatedly set himself in opposition to the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, who rejected classification as arbi- trary and argued that nature was characterized instead by disorder. The guinea pig was gentle, according to Buffon, but capable only of reproducing-not of accomplishing good. Peale chastised Buffon for this view, writing, "I do not admire this degradation of any species. ... It may be witty. I am sure it is not pious" ("A Walk," p. 29). Even members of the lowliest species served a valu- able purpose, and therefore their perpetuation was necessary. Buffon described the existence of the woodpecker as irredeemably painful and slavelike, but Peale countered that these archetypal workers were uniquely formed to accom- plish their life-sustaining tasks (pp. 62-66). Moreover, employing the por- traitist's assumption of the relationship between physiognomy and character, Peale argued that the woodpecker's face "is rather dainty, than coarse." Extracting the moral from this case, Peale continued, "The goodness of prov- idence is manifested to all his creatures; each enjoy life in its fullest extent:- None are made to be miserable, or even unhappy.-The sphere of each is mea- sured with equal goodness. and it is those only, who suffer, that step aside from Natures paths."50 In human terms, Peale's perceptions of hierarchy attributed social distinctions to natural, even providential, order. While this precluded social mobility, it commanded the lofty to respect and appreciate their in- feriors. To do otherwise would be unnatural and against the will of God.51 "ASK THE BEASTS, AND THEY SHALL TEACH THEE" On the walls of the museum, Peale inscribed quotations to inspire Christian contemplation of divine works in nature. His lectures and advertisements quoted directly from biblical passages, and he actively sought the support of Philadelphia's clergymen in promoting the museum. Many of them endorsed the museum's teachings, and they consistently argued that there was no con- tradiction between scientific knowledge and Christian piety.52 Among those 50. Peale wrote, for example, "The happiness of many Individuals is attached to the happiness of mankind, and he is under obligations to exert himself for the general good, because his own depends on it"; see "Orang- Outang, Baboons and Monkies," Miller, Collected Papers (Kraus Microform), lecture 1, p. 7, IID/4. 51.

Waddell, and James Abercrombie; Presbyterians John Ewing, John Blair Smith, and Ashbel Green; Associate Church minister William Marshall; Baptist Thomas Fleeson; and Lutheran Henry Helmuth (see Brigham, "'A World in Miniature,"' 452). w 203</page><page sequence="23">204 DAVID R. BRIGHAM ministers, Swedish Lutheran leader Nicholas Collin was the most active pro- ponent of the religious significance of Peale's natural history displays. Beginning in 1788, Peale distributed tickets depicting a banner that read, "The Birds &amp; Beasts will teach thee!," a paraphrase from Job 12:7 (fig. 8). This passage thus greeted every visitor, and it continued to be important in pro- moting the museum. Collin featured it in a series of essays he wrote in support of Peale, published in December 1800 to encourage attendance at Peale's lec- tures on natural history. In his first essay, Collin argued that the study of nature was important chiefly because it facilitated the "direct promotion of Religion." Collin supported his belief in the consistency between science and Christianity with a number of biblical quotations, including the one from Job, expanded: Ask the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind?53 The lessons to be learned through attendance at the museum were comple- mentary to those gained through other aspects of a pious life. In the principle of plenitude, Peale found evidence not only of the Great Chain of Being but also of the work of God. In his opening lecture Peale declared the variety and fullness of nature to "display the wisdom and Goodness of a Benificent God." He quoted Psalm 104, "O! Lord how manifold are thy works; in wisdom hast thou made them all; the Earth is full of thy riches.54 The wealth of the new republic was based on resources to be exploited, but it also embodied divine providence. Peale recalled for his listeners God's charge to Noah after the flood: And the fear of you, and the dread of you shall be upon every Beast of the Earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the Earth, and upon all the fishes of the Sea: into your hands are they delivered.55 53.

However, this grant of control carried with it the responsibility of stew- ardship. Despite the limits of lesser animals, God provided for the care and sus- tenance of all. Collin, quoting Matthew, suggested this aspect of God's plan to Peale's audience: "Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet our Heavenly Father feedeth them."56 The republican implication of this passage may have been to remind the better sort of their duty to sustain and care for the lower sorts. God's intention was also evident in the fittedness of all creatures to their place in the natural hierarchy. Despite the awkward appearance of the toucan, for instance, Peale argued that "on a closer view we find the perfection of the work of Creation; in providing suitable organs for the support and also happi- ness of each individual being: each species fitted to fill their various stations allotted them in the great scale of Nature, and the more we inspect into her ways, the more we shall have abundant cause to lift up our hearts and minds in love and admiration of the great first cause!"

BRIGHAM to the Bible added the weight of God's will to Peale's vision of a republic founded upon natural principles. In constructing his natural history displays, Peale drew upon all of his skills as an artist, a term that I use here in the broadest sense to mean the human transfor- mation of materials. He hunted animals, crafted specimens into lifelike forms, and created habitats in which to exhibit them. Through his writings, Peale elaborated on his intentions in "arranging the stuff of nature." The goal of his interpretive pro- gram was to present nature as inherently harmonious and hierarchical. Peale encouraged citizens to model their economic, social, and political life after these two natural principles, and he and his colleagues urged that such order was also God's will. I conclude by quoting a passage from Reverend Collin's essays on Peale, in which he extolled the museum's success in presenting harmony and hierarchy as naturally and divinely ordained social values: Knowledge and goodness are by Him distributed in a great variety of degrees from the upper to the lowest ranks! dis- cernible in their domestic plans, and social systems. Good will to the species-reciprocal offices among fellow citizens- parental love-filial affection, conjugal tenderness-are general and in the degrees most suitable to the condition of each kind. ...
