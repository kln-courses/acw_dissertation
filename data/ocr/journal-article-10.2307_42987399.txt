<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beauty and the Beast: The Coevolution of Plants and Animals By Susan Grant; illustrations by Laszlo Kubinyi 215pp. plus illustrations. $14.95 Cloth. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1984. tTTTomen writers have contributed 'Лг significantly to our understand- ing and appreciation of coevolution. While Dr. Grant mentions Peter Kro- potkin's Mutual Aid , she ignores the work of his contemporary social Dar- winists such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Olive Schreiner. For exam- ple, Schreiner argued that the tradi- tional survival of the fittest slogan was inappropriate and that "those who have loved and aided each other most have survived - the fittest to live, not the fittest to kill" ( From Man to Man , 1926). Lynn Margulis, one of todays most active researchers on symbiosis, recently challenged everyone present at the National Association of Biology Teachers annual meeting to name a single species that did not enter into a symbiotic relationship during some portion of its life history. No one could meet her challenge. Nonetheless, Grant assumes a Spencerian adversarial tone throughout most of Beauty and the Beast. Her mili- tary metaphor dominates the first third of the book. An "arms race" (p.ll), "chemical warfare" (p.33), "heavier weaponry" (p.40), and "troops . . . mar- shalled" (p.42) are just some of the more egregious examples of this con- frontationist interpretation of nature. "The peaceful side of coevolution" is not introduced until page 75. Donna Jane Haraway has challenged E.O. Wil- son's and others' inventions of soldier ants, army ants, scouts, guards, and phalanx as a militarist social construc- tion that hinders any other biologist from perceiving these species and individuals in any way free of such associations. Grant's use of teleological and anthro- pomorphic language is excessive and wearing on the reader. She attempts to temper it at times by saying "almost as if," but it is only an excuse for imput- ing motives to plants and insects. If she is really interested in coevolution, her "adaptationist programme of just- so stories" should be stated in more testable terms. She is careful at times</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS to point out that certain well-held assumptions have not been tested or are not even testable; however, she does not impose the same caveats on her teleological and anthropomorphic excesses. Grant can and does develop human interest without being anthropomor- phic. She uses a Chinese parable related to bamboo's 120-year interval between flowering, Biblical asides (John the Baptist ate carob pods, not locusts; ants were known to cache seeds in biblical times), analogies between "airborne chemical wafts" and Tolkien's Old Man Willow, and even excusable lines too hard to resist such as squirrels "pursu- ing the pine of least resistance" (p.37). She points out food dangers associated with soybeans, teas, parsnips, black beans, and acorns. Her comparison of mixed function oxidase (MFO) activity in species other than Homo sapiens to our detoxification and tolerance of ethanol is an interesting evolutionary speculation. The bibliography is excellent. While it is not referred to explicitly through- out the text, the references at the end of the book are in nonalphabetical order and listed by chapter. This jnakes it fairly easy to associate any story within the text with a particular source. The many presumably coevolved associations are subject to some scru- tiny. Grant even suggests particular experiments to be performed before we extrapolate too far from well-studied examples. She also introduces theories for understanding life history strategies and altruistic behavior. The other strength of Grant's approach is the heavy emphasis on plant partners in animal-plant associations. Except for orchids, plants are given short shrift in many other treatments. On the other hand, only classical marine symbioses are discussed, and too little attention is given to bacteria and protozoa. If the reader can overlook the teleo- logical, anthropomorphic, and military metaphors, Beauty and the Beast is an informative survey of a variety of coevo- lutionary scenarios across a wide phylo- genetic array. - John R.Jungck, professor and chairper- son , Department of Biology, Beloit Col- lege, Beloit, Wl 53511</page></plain_text>
