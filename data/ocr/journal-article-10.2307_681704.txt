This terminology pervades the analysis made by most authors (for the extreme form, see Marin, chapter 10); thus, it is difficult for the postmodern, poststructuralist, or post-1960s "practice theory" reader, for that matter, to take the book seriously. With this unfortunate theoretical isolation, several problems emerge that negatively affect the topics and issues discussed. First, the people described or talked about are given no agency; they hardly ever speak: children, adolescents, and ethnics are either enculturated, socialized, or acculturated by someone (parents) or by something (family, school, or the media). Resistance is not a possibility as it is in Paul Willis's ethnographic study of adolescence in Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs (Co- lumbia University Press, 1977). One of the unstated conclusions reached from this (not only theoretical, but) silently politicized point of view, and which appears unchal- lenged, is that ethnics are children in the process of becoming mature adults-whites? (see especially de Vos, chapter 13; for a vari- ant of this "development" strategy at the indi- vidual level, see Phinney, chapter 5; for a critique of the "melting pot" hypothesis-one that, curiously, does not escape the "assimila- tion" mentality-see Berry, chapter 14). Second, this hegemonic process on the part of the psychologists reduces "ethnic" identity to a racial(ized), stereotypic process where "Mexican, Chicano and Hispanic" chil- dren are children who hit "pinatas" (p. 36, p. 120), eat "menudo" (p. 39, chapter 3), "watch Spanish television" (p. 123, chapter 7), and "engage in highly specific and day-to-day eth- nic behaviors (e.g., I eat frijoles)" (p. 227, chapter 12), and where African-American children are "black" children because they have identified a "black child" in a photo- graph ("This person is black. Are you black?" chapter 4, p. 49). As a consequence, "ethnic- ity," "race," "black," "Mexican," and "His- panic" are, for the most part, reified, essen- tialized categories themselves, not social categories that were politically and histori- cally constructed. Only chapter 8, by Hurtado et al., historicizes and considers the issue of "social identity" critically. In chapter 2, Ocampo et al. differentiate the distinct stages or "sequences" of chil- dren's awareness of gender, race, and ethnic identities in the socialization process. They argue that gender and race "constancies" are nerz had thought more, at least beyond trivial statements such as that cities are dense con- centrations, that they are places of refuge and "counter-cultural" resistance, that they are centers of interface between different per- spectives, and so forth. Hannerz has broached important issues and questions in this work, but he stays clear of the more contentious dimensions of cul- tural complexity and its rhetoric. Little space is given to the global processes influencing discourses surrounding culture in relation to nationalism, ethnic and other social move- ments, and new state and popular ideologies of multiculturalism. Given the subject matter of the book, it is curiously flat, a flatness no doubt contributed to by the balance and ur- banity of the writing style. The book exudes a secure common sense, indeed a rationalism, of a kind that the postmodernism that pro- vides the ambience of this work would be critical of. Anthropology is at a challenging and excit- ing moment in its history, some of this born of global developments. Hannerz communi- cates little sense of this nor of the great con- tribution anthropological debate and work in cultural worlds can yield to other commenta- tors and scholars engaged in a discourse about culture. Ethnic Identity: Formation and Transmission among Hispanics and Other Minorities. Martha E. Bernal and George P. Knight, eds. SUNY Series, United States Hispanic Studies. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993. 311 pp. AlEJANDRO LUGO University of Texas, El Paso Ethnic Identity is a serious attempt to deci- pher the complex social, psychological, and political processes constituting the "forma- tion and transmission" of "ethnicity" among "minorities" both in the United States and in Canada. The volume is richly composed of an introduction and 13 other chapters, all writ- ten by various psychologists and one demog- rapher. With the exceptions of Hurtado et al. (chapter 8), Buriel and Cardoza (chapter 11), and Berry (chapter 14), the arguments utilized in this book to explain the subject matter under study-ethnicity-follow a "de- velopmental perspective" (p. 3) from psychol- ogy that, in one way or another, still includes such discredited anthropological notions as</page><page sequence="2">GENERAL/T HEORETICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 463 first acquired because children are able to identify their own "physical characteristics" or attributes through observation. As if children did not emulate cultural practices, they noted that "[ethnic] differences are behavioral, rather than physical, and thus are harder to distinguish than gender and racial differ- ences" (p. 25). These conclusions reached by Ocampo et al. not only reduce gender and race to biology but also ignore both the femi- nist literature on the cultural construction of gender (see Stoler's analysis in American Eth- nologist [16(4):634-660] of how race is actu- ally gendered) and the role of the state in imposing certain ethnic categories, especially in multicultural societies (it is not until the last chapter, chapter 14 [Berry], that the issue of the state is addressed). Nonetheless, Ocampo et al. convincingly argue that ethnic awareness occurs sometime between 5 and 12 years of age. In spite of this call for the realization that "ethnicity" does not occur in the minds of children until the fifth birthday (just about the time they begin attending school-a state institution!), the rest of the authors totally ignore the hypothe- sis as well as the importance of gender and discuss the formation and transmission of ethnicity throughout the boak as if ethnic identity was universally an aspect of the self, self-identification, or social identity "trans- mitted" both by family and "nonfamily." As Bernal and Knight generalized, "Ethnic iden- tity is one aspect of the important question, 'Who am I?' It constitutes a basic part of the ethnic individual's personality" (p. 1). With regard to the pervasive lack of gender analy- sis, the feminist focus on power relations be- tween husband and wife could have been useful, for example, in answering the ques- tions Estrada asked in chapter 9 when con- fronted with the fact that children raised un- der an Anglo father and a Hispanic mother are raised "Anglo" (p. 178). Lastly, there is no useful or applicable defi- nition of "ethnic identity." Tautologies abound until Hurtado et al. distinguish "eth- nic identity" from other "social identities" 130 pages later. For example, Bernal et al. (chap- ter 3) write, "Ethnic identity is a construct or set of self-ideas about one's own ethnic group membership" (p. 33; identical definitions are used throughout the book; see Aboud and Doyle, chapter 4, p. 47); Phinney (chapter 5), in her analysis of ethnic identity development among adolescents, does not distinguish be- tween "minorities" and "ethnics" with rigor and talks about "ethnic minority" (p. 63) ren- dering the existence of white ethnics almost invisible (see p. 65). Finally, this lack of aware- ness of a widespread multicultural setting, though acknowledged by Berry (chapter 14), is evident in the conceptual framework of Rotheram-Borus's work on adolescence (chapter 6). Even though Rotheram-Borus noted that "in increasingly pluralistic socie- ties, contact is often with more than one group and, as a result, youth become[s] mul- ticultural" (p. 83), she insists on emphasizing "biculturalism," unconsciously following the "acculturation-assimilation" paradigm, which characterizes the "contact between two cul- tures" syndrome diffused throughout most of the book and which characterized psycho- logical anthropology at the end of World War II. Perhaps Renato Rosaldo's eloquent expo- sition of "cultural borderlands" in Culture and Truth (Beacon Press, 1989) can serve as an adequate reference to rethink these issues. Maybe in the second edition, and for the readers' sake, the editors will consider a much more legitimate form of dialogue in which the politics and production of the discourse on "ethnicity" can be appropriately discussed in an interdisciplinary context that none of us can ignore anymore. Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Relig- ion. Stewart Elliott Guthrie. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. 302 pp. IVAN BRADY State University of New York, Oswego Every thoughtful human being on the planet knows that consciousness brings a sense of mortality; that death brings a sense of loss to the survivors; that contemplating death begs questions about the difference between animated and unanimated bodies; that our inability to control misfortune, the terrors of some dreams and the night, and the need to escape from disease and death under- write an ancient search for realities beyond appearance. That is the stuff of religion. Guthrie scarcely mentions such things, but he connects to them all in a provocative way. He argues that anthropomorphism, "the attribu- tion of human characteristics to nonhuman things or events" (p. 3), is a universal and fundamental part of the human cognitive imperative to make sense of contradictory experiences. So are "optimizing" perceptual strategies-selection for an interpretation that seems best for the circumstances, that perhaps carries "the most meaning," espe-</page></plain_text>
