<plain_text><page sequence="1">Penning Ulysses Greeting, Grave Gentles; thank you for your welcome. I must confess I am extremely nervous at having to address such an august body: the word English stands for the vibrant and intractable language I love to distraction, and the word A cademy is, to me, redolent of erudition - a quality I admire, which reduces me to hopeless envy. So I do not feel at all adequate to this evening's task: the Seventh English Academy Lecture, no less. I must further confess that I circled the invitation to address you with all the circumspection of a hermit crab (Diogenes brevirostris) carefully circumnavigating a motionless coastal octopus (Octopus vulgaris) that an oceanic god - in this case, angry Poseidon - has suddenly and, as usual, enigmatically beached in the startled crustacean's vicinity: in the littoral zone, naturally. Somebody in Durban lent me their EARs, and I have studied the beautiful English and the erudition of the Academy Lectures therein, and this has increased my terror. I did toy with the idea of transfixing you all with a talk entitled "Literary Deconstruction in the New South Africa." But I am a limited man and find the effect of the literature I enjoy deliriously constructive while fearing - a trifle grimly - that the new South Africa may be not too different from the old: the same voracious appetites for power tricked out in perhaps more saintly raiment, the same psychopathic gauleiters nudging us to write only 'suitable' material which suitably displays our officially stamped social consciences, while we drift into yet another minor variation of kleptocracy. So I decided not to attempt this as I am viscerally unable to accommodate an ochlocracy, a ptochocracy, nor indeed a Thirty-third Reich. So I thought about the bigger themes currently doing the rounds in that so called West that we so love to emulate: 'Avarice is admirable,' or 'It is impossible to be too rich or too thin,' and its corollary: 'Asceticism plus aerobics equals eternal life.' But then I admitted to myself, one can get all such and similar spiritual nourishment from overseas and local glossies once a month or, if one is masochistically inclined, weekly. English in Africa 40 No. 3 (December 2013): 113—123 DOI: http://dx.doi.org-/10.4314/eia.v40i3.20</page><page sequence="2">114 DOUGLAS LIVINGSTONE Next, I thought to offer the English Academy a refurbished and utterly noble crusade, which I will outline: a talented (black) writer said to me early this year, "We are not a nation of readers, but a nation of writers." She said it with consummate regret. And why are we a nation of so-called writers, but not readers? Now there's a challenge for the English Academy: to get the government - whoever they are - to eliminate ALL taxes on ALL books. Enlist the publishers and booksellers including the overseas giants to help fund this great crusade. No wonder there exists this nation of writers patiently penning their boring Odysseys, taking a local gap, that no one either wants or is able to read, while good books remain a hell of a price. The (financial) inaccessibility of literature is harming the country, in the long term, at least as much as the latest virus or soil erosion. By the same token, we are in danger of becoming a nation that talks but does not listen - except perhaps to commune with a square box with a magic casement on to transatlantic trivia: a window that becomes blandly opaque when the juice is turned off, perfectly reflecting its viewers' neocortices (in a nutshell). I look forward, impatiently, to the day when not only is there is no more racial discrimination and a decent education is accessible to everyone, but to the day when frightened or guilty editors can stop publishing garbage. Whether it's 'privileged' garbage or 'underprivileged' garbage, the torrent of garbage gets printed on what were once trees; and trees are beginning to assume the aura of a rather precious commodity on this planet of easily disposable life forms, including its dominant life form (As every schoolgirl knows: a one metre high pile of old newspapers, if recycled, will save one tree.) So, how about it, Dear English Academy?: someone, some day, hearing the three syllables South Africa, nodding reflectively and saying: "Ah, yes, a nation of readers," thanks to the English Academy bringing down the price of books. In the meantime, we could do worse than to each plant a tree and give away some books - those of us who have them. But that hardly constitutes a Lecture, does it? - a speech of approximately two minutes. Alas, I've been told to sing for my supper; another twenty or so minutes worth is required, so please relax and be comfortable for a spell longer. Let me confess at once, Grave Gentles, I am a mere microbiologist, who scribbles occasional verse - which is a vile and solitary habit - and I cannot hope to live up to your expectations. So - snatched away from the reductive vision of my microscope and the consolation of my vile and solitary habit - I see my role here as that of an entertainer: delivering random jottings remote from crusades and profundities, telling a literary joke or two, reading a couple of my favourite poems - not, I hasten to add, penned by me - all</page><page sequence="3">PENNING ULYSSES 115 framed by the story of Ulysses, or Odysseus, which should be safe and painless for all concerned. Except that I have arrived at this quite incredible new literary theorem which I will attempt to share with you, if there is time, positively supra-political in its analytical depth and meta-Jungian in its social implications and relevance to life and to letters. In the laboratory where I work is a large room with vast tanks of domino fish, among other denizens of the not-so-deep such as sea-urchins, the gametes of which are used in the toxicity testing of effluents. Everyone in the tanks is treated with extreme kindness, even courtesy; plenty of food, ultraviolet light; even love. And not they but - may I put it delicately - their procreative emissions are sacrificed on the altar of science. There is, moreover, an octopus (Octopus vulgaris) - the small coastal species - called Ulysses, and his behaviour is being studied in the light of his response to the stimulus of light beamed in various wavelengths (colours) and intensities. Occasionally he has to be removed for weighing and other measurements. He is very good at evading the net. He is shy/bold; helpless/resourceful; abject/aggressive; and he avoids the net wielded by the gods - the scientists - with immense skill: he is patently on a learning curve during this part of his journey through life. He is also growing far larger than his cousins in the azure main. And I hope - sometimes ashamedly, having read my Jules Verne - he is never returned to angry Poseidon's domain; but he may clamber out and undulate there yet: he's already half-way out of his tank in anticipation come mealtimes. Ulysses is becoming very difficult to pen. And, in my more fanciful moments, watching him, I note, not to put too fine an anthropomorphic point to it, he is beginning to look rather knowing. He is beginning to look like an archetype. Actually, I am not going to expound any further on my laboratory Ulysses, the common or vulgar coastal octopus who is rapidly learning to become unpennable. The only reason his presence has intruded upon us here this evening is the fortuitous coincidence of his name. Before leaving the realms of science, we could spare a nod to another Ulysses, the European spacecraft to be launched in October this year, to pass over the sun's poles between February and September, 1995. Antinuclear protesters are trying to pen this Ulysses because it will be carrying 11 kg of plutonium-238 dioxide to power the reactor aboard which will provide electricity for the vehicle. I'm not sure about the protesters' chances. What worries me is this Ulysses is first travelling to Jupiter, the giant gas planet, and with a name like that - Jupiter, or Zeus to give him his Greek name - anything could happen with a 'slingshot' or gravitational trajectory,</page><page sequence="4">116 DOUGLAS LIVINGSTONE swanning around our small but exceptionally beautiful, if largely lifeless, solar system. The real subject under our microscope tonight is the real Ulysses or, to give him his real name, Odysseus. Ulysses - as every schoolboy knows - is his Roman name. The Romans were fairly narrow-minded, apart from a few of their poets; they were regimented, militaristic and with the quaint habit of feeding their lions (Panthera leo) consecrated protein. Feeling in need of some culture they embraced the Greek pantheon with gusto. Being Roman and very nationalistic, they renamed most of the Greek gods and goddesses, heroines and heroes, endowing them with Roman names - just like today: whenever a new regime takes over, most of the towns and streets and all of the airports get renamed, which is hell on the publishers of maps and atlases, and on the postal authorities in the rest of the world. Incidentally, it is believed by some there is only the sketchiest of links between Homer's Odyssey and Joyce's Ulysses-, not because Odysseus's journey home took ten years and meandered all over a mythic Mediterranean while Joyce's musical and bawdy masterpiece was contained by just one glorious 'Bloomsday,' and was geographically confined to pre-World War I Dublin. Joyce initially strikes one as having chosen the title Ulysses almost as a literary tease. A case could be made, I suppose, for the earth-mother/ wife, the adulterous man-wise Molly Bloom as a Muse, a sort of update of the virtuous Penelope towards whom the Greek Odysseus ever journeyed. But there is one more parallel, of which more in a minute. I believe it is fashionable to label The Odyssey 'adventure-epic,' while Joyce's Ulysses is sometimes called 'poetical-autobiography,' and any similarities between them are thought to be no closer than are to be found in any other pair of works from these separately defined genres. But I wonder ... The Odyssey and Ulysses certainly share an underlying substructure, uncommon for more than twenty centuries after Homer, but cropping up with increasing frequency in our own times - that which could be tentatively paraphrased as: 'the human condition is lived in exile from something else.' It should be added: this underlying, somewhat plaintive melody is almost drowned out in the surface tumult and uproar, 'the surge and thunder' of The Odyssey, but it is unmistakably there. It is, of course, insistent in the Irish work. And (to me), this substructure also lends a particularly poignant element to the better writings from this our beloved country: the 'exile' and the 'something else' being, neither of them, necessarily geographical but probably metaphysical. Of course, Joyce's Ulysses has earned some strictures. E. M. Forster in his Aspects of the Novel called the book "a dogged attempt to cover the universe with mud;" while Henry Miller said the novel should be read only in the toilet to extract its full flavour. Mind you, I think Miller is guilty of a</page><page sequence="5">PENNING ULYSSES 117 bit of pot-calling here: I have worked it out on the expensive computers at my disposal: if we allow Henry Miller eight hours per day for eating, sleeping, keeping himself clean - attending to his toilet, as it were - most of the remaining sixteen hours were necessary for recording his trivia, penning his endlessly boring odysseys. I have calculated he had no more than ninety six seconds per month for his alleged conquests and callisthenics. Reading Miller I have often wished he had spent sixteen hours a day gratifying his confessed appetites, and spent ninety-six seconds per month writing about them. Before embarking on our real Odyssey, traversing the wine-dark sea, I trust no cyclopean charges of Eurocentricity will be levelled later. Greece is where Europe, Asia Minor and Africa once met before the slow motion gavotte of the tectonic plates commenced gliding their stately continental measures. And who are we to argue with our Holy Mother - the Planet Earth - who settled on our antecedents and their environs many centuries after she decided she'd had enough of dinosaurs, that it was time to indulge a new folly - humanity - for a spell. Speaking quite comfortably as an African (albeit a white one) I refuse to concede even one square inch (or 2.54cm2) of this my planet to the territorial chauvinists: I cannot renounce any part of this globe's literature or culture - the fact that I am an earthman takes precedence even over the fact that I am an African. Our parochial villages are mere suburbs of the growing global metropolis, almost in opposition - it could be said - to the fragmentation of the tectonic plates under our feet, which is taking place even at this moment. I trust the classical purists among you will forgive me while I canter through a brief resume of The Odyssey. Odysseus, King of Ithaka, appears, as everyone knows, in The Iliad - he was one of the invaders in the Trojan War, but not always at centre stage. Homer has him there, certainly, but often overshadowed by other participants, rapes, tempers, heroic sulks, military feats of arms, dire diversions orchestrated by the gods, etc. When it comes to deception, sapping the enemy's vitals and subterfuges, Odysseus is quite a number in the siege of Troy. In The Odyssey, he is at centre-stage throughout, hogging the limelight. He is the Big Enchilada: wily/stupid; resourceful/clumsy; perceptive/obtuse; brave/cowardly; chivalrous/abject - a typical male prodigy, as the feminists among us (of whom, as all the world knows, I am the staunchest) might aver. Odysseus had a very high SQ - or survival quotient - which, given his quest, was probably more important than a high IQ, then if not now. Odysseus is not only a general paradigm for humanity - tender/ruthless,</page><page sequence="6">118 DOUGLAS LIVINGSTONE direct/duplicitous - he is, along with his travails, actually a metaphor for a particular type of human, to whom I will return and identify. There is a theory that The Iliad and The Odyssey were penned by different hands. I think it was not only Robert Graves who suggested that: while Homer (whoever he was) wrote The Iliad, Homer's daughter penned The Odyssey. However, somebody fed both narratives into a computer fairly recently - I think at Cambridge or Harvard - and the computer ruled that both were indeed the product of the same hand. (Mind you, anyone with a bank account or a telephone will have grave reservations on the infallibility of computers. Just look at what mine said about Henry Miller.) Having happily perused both epics over many years, I would combine Graves and Cambridge (or Harvard) and opine both books were indeed penned by Homer but, considering especially the enchanting sexist, feminist slant whenever goddesses are involved (which is often!), Homer was a woman. Among the almost one thousand 'proofs' I have collated, I will offer you just one: we are told Odysseus was particularly beloved by the goddess Athena ("grey-eyed Athena") for his skill in lyingl Surely, only a deeply enamoured and forgiving woman could write thus about a mere mendacious male so approvingly - men tend to pretend they and their heroes are 'bluffly honest.' Granted that the ten-year war and siege of Troy (The Iliad) was - geographically speaking - essentially static, while the ten-year wandering and adventures of The Odyssey are indisputably physically dynamic, an expert author like Homer - or Ouma, perhaps? - was and is perfectly capable of executing this kinetic metamorphosis. And if both books are treated as one, and to borrow an image from music, what could be more natural than to have the slow movement followed by the fast? All that is, of course, by the way. Let us at once embark on our canter around the wine-dark sea with the son of Laertes, or the journey could take us another ten years. (I have taken the liberty of reducing the often convoluted Odyssey to an outline of the sequential narrative, at least initially. And I pray, again, to the classical purists to forgive this brief synopsis: it may be that some years have elapsed since all present tonight last set forth on this particular Mediterranean trek.) We can start with an ending: leaving the topless towers of Ilium borne aloft by flames. Many good and bad men are dead; others maimed. Troy is defeated; and the victors - the Greeks - start their various journeys home: they are exhausted, and in their nostrils lingers the stench of ashes, which is probably the single most common reward for victorious armies the world over. Now I would ask you to join me in a literary game. I have performed some tentative surgery on The Odyssey and have come up with about sixteen</page><page sequence="7">PENNING ULYSSES 119 pieces: not of limbs or organs, but stations in the development or learning curve in the life of a poet. There will not be time to cover all the markers in detail this evening, so I will concentrate on a few, race through the others; and you may come up with others of your own choosing, or insert your own interpretations. (I'm sure you will get the hang of it swiftly, and I hope it will provide you with an amusing or stimulating evening.) Odysseus left the shore of Troy with twelve ships, and in an act of inexcusable piracy raided the city of Ismarus, losing six men from each ship. He did spare Marco, the priest of Apollo, who gave him some magic wine in return, which would serve the seafarer well later. Here we have the start or launch of the poet or writer, raiding literature ruthlessly and destructively: he finds one writer he respects and spares him — for which he is rewarded, the benefits becoming palpable later. Next, sailors are blown off course and end up in the land of the Lotus Eaters who offer their narcotic substances to Odysseus and his crew. Some of the men eat of the lotus and forget homes and families: all they want to do is sit and dream their lives away. Odysseus has the drugged ones dragged back to the ships and confined below decks for a cold-turkey cure. The lotus, of course, represents that dull world where all creative expenditure of sinew, brain, breath and heart ceases in pleasantly vague and useless daydreams. As we all know, the word poetry comes from a Greek word meaning 'to make:' the process is no less energetic in sculpting, painting, composing music, writing novels or cooking well. Odysseus recognised the deadly soporific undermining the creativity of his crew, and therefore of his journey, and stopped the rot. Next, on yet another strange beach, Odysseus and twelve men go ashore and find a giant's cave. In the evening the giant returns, driving in his giant sheep. Polyphemus, the Cyclops, sees the intruders and has two of the men for supper. He then blocks the doorway with a huge rock and goes to sleep. In the morning Polyphemus breakfasts on two more of the crew, and departs driving his sheep to pasture, taking care to block the cave's entrance when he leaves. Now, as we are all aware, it is impossible to pen Odysseus, or not for long anyway. He and his remaining men get hold of a great pole they find in the cave and shape one end into a formidable point, like a pencil. Polyphemus returns, eats two more of the crew for supper and sets about retiring. Odysseus gives the giant the flask of wine from Marco, and they chat whiles the Cyclops gets drunk as he is used only to milk. During their conversation the Greek tells the giant his name is No-man. The men heat the giant pencil and plunge it into the single eye of the Cyclops when he falls asleep. Polyphemus wakes and roars for help. Other cyclopes come running and shout, asking Polyphemus: 'Who is attacking you?' The blinded man</page><page sequence="8">120 DOUGLAS LIVINGSTONE replies: 'No-man,' so all the other cyclopes depart, no doubt shaking their heads. (I've always found this to be a particularly creaky part of The Odyssey.) In the morning the eyeless Polyphemus rolls the stone away and herds his sheep out, carefully feeling their backs to make sure none of these pesky Greeks is hitching a ride to freedom. But Odysseus has tied his remaining men to the bellies of the sheep and they all get away, Odysseus last of all clinging beneath the giant's pet ram. They reach ship safely; but Odysseus now makes a mistake: he taunts the Cyclops, yelling at him, telling him his real name. Polyphemus calls on his father Poseidon - god of the sea - to punish his tormentor, so Odysseus gets cursed: if he ever reaches home, it will take years to do so; he will lose all his men; and he will return to a very bad situation. As you probably recall, angry Poseidon ensured that it all happened just like that. Here, the Cyclops Polyphemus represents the culture -cops, those polit-lit critics with their monocular vision, intent on intimidating writers, forcing the captive literati into penning only what pleases the tunnel-visioned, thus consuming them. In another more recent, more painful era they were known as gauleiters, or comrade-censors. They can be defeated, or at least outfoxed by a cunningly, fearlessly wielded pen or pencil. Good literature, like good wine tends to befuddle their senses as they are used only to the milk or pap of their limited cerebral diets. It is possible to write so they cannot understand you, but it's best not to taunt them by rubbing it in because much destructive power is usually available to them. There, I think you have got the general idea of this modestly fresh way of looking at The Odyssey, the literary journey of a poet's life; and before returning, very briefly, to this son of Laertes, here is a small Mediterranean interlude: one of my favourite poems - James Elroy Flecker's "The Old Ships:" I have seen old ships sail like swans asleep Beyond the village which men still call Tyre, With leaden age o'ercargoed, dipping deep For Famagusta and the hidden sun That rings black Cyprus with a lake of fire; And all those ships were certainly so old Who knows how oft with squat and noisy gun, Questing brown slaves or Syrian oranges, The pirate Genoese Hell-ranked them till they rolled Blood, water, fruit and corpses up the hold. But now through friendly seas they softly run, Painted the mid-sea blue or shore-sea green, Still patterned with the vine and grapes in gold.</page><page sequence="9">PENNING ULYSSES 121 But I have seen, Pointing her shapely shadows from the dawn An image tumbled on a rose-swept bay, A drowsy ship of some yet older day; And, wonder's breath indrawn, Thought I - who knows - who knows - but in that same (Fished up beyond Aeaea, patched up new - Stem painted brighter blue -) That talkative, bald-headed seaman came (Twelve patient comrades sweating at the oar) From Troy's doom-crimson shore, And with great lies about his wooden horse Set the crew laughing, and forgot his course. It was so old a ship - who knows, who knows? - And yet so beautiful, I watched in vain To see the mast burst open with a rose, And the whole deck put on its leaves again. Meanwhile, back in Ithaka, Penelope, Odysseus' wife to whom he is struggling to return, is under pressure to declare her husband dead and marry one of the many suitors who have occupied the palace. But the absent husband/poet/navigator has many more trials and tribulations to suffer before he can rejoin her. She, naturally, represents his Muse (and he does win through in the end). First, Odysseus has to encounter Circe, the enchantress who is so seductive she turns all men into absolute swines. (She was also visited by Jason and the Argonauts.) There is one of many shipwrecks on the shores of the man-eating giants, the rather suburban Laestrygonians. Odysseus also has to descend into the underworld and talk to the dead Tiresias, who could represent the spirit of departed poets and their wisdoms. There are the Sirens, those tempters of the senses who would lure him from his quest. There are the monsters Scylla and Charybdis who, along with several of the suitors besieging Penelope, among many other characters in The Odyssey, represent rapacious publishers, ill-informed or chauvinistic supine or quasi literate critics, fiercely dictatorial editors, printers who specialise in misprints, academics awash or drowning in the seas of misinterpretation, cunning plagiarists who attempt to steal a writer's best work, lax booksellers who will not only give him time off to pen his masterpieces, and the envious rivals and false poets who besiege the Muse hoping the others will drown in the oceans of mediocrity ahead of them. There are, too, the hosts (and sometimes the hostesses) of the suburban dinner-party circuit intent on</page><page sequence="10">122 DOUGLAS LIVINGSTONE acquiring a literary scalp or two. They are all there, and more, in The Odyssey, a poet's journey, if you care to interpret it thus with assignable humour and happy recognitions. There is even, tragically, the nymph Calypso who loved Odysseus and bound him to her side for seven years with the generosity of her earthy passions and metaphysical wiles. But she was not his Muse, and Athena eventually got Zeus to send Hermes with orders to release him... I hope you have enjoyed our literary game. We are all, everyone on the planet, perhaps at least partly, spiritually or temperamentally Greek - of that small nation of a few thousands of years ago that entered humanity's essential psyche, or who early charted its complex voyage, if you like. You may even agree with me The Odyssey is not only adventure-epic but also a (not so heavily disguised) poet's biography. I would, before ending with a brief literary anecdote, share another good poem with you, by an Alexandrian Greek, from the first half of this our twentieth century; a poet whom I would say is this continent of Africa's greatest poet - Constantine Cavafy: Ithaka When you set out for Ithaka ask that your way be long, full of adventure, full of instruction. The Laestrygonians and the Cyclops, angry Poseidon - do not fear them: such as these you will never find as long as your thought is lofty, as long as a rare emotion touch your spirit and your body. The Laestrygonians and the Cyclops, angry Poseidon - you will not meet them unless you carry them in your soul, unless your soul raise them up before you. Ask that your way be long. At many a summer dawn to enter - with what gratitude, what joy - ports seen for the first time; to stop at Phoenician trading centres, and to buy good merchandise, mother of pearl and coral, timber and ebony, and sensuous perfumes of every kind, sensuous perfumes as lavishly as you can, to visit Egyptian cities, to gather stores of knowledge from the learned.</page><page sequence="11">PENNING ULYSSES 123 Have Ithaka always in your mind. Your arrival there is what you are destined for. But don't in the least hurry the journey. Better it last for years, so that when you reach the island you are old, rich with all you have gained on the way, not expecting Ithaka to give you wealth. Ithaka gave you the splendid journey. Without her you would not have set out. She hasn't anything else to give you. And if you find her poor, Ithaka hasn't deceived you. So wise have you become, of such experience, that already you'll have understood what these Ithakas mean. To end: this charming (I think) literary anecdote, and a return to the Celtic Muse. A young Irishman, recognised James Joyce in Zurich, rushed up to him, seized him by the hand and cried: "Just let me kiss the hand that penned UlyssesAn outraged Joyce snatched his hand back growling: "That hand's done a lot more than penning Ulyssesl" [Delivered as the seventh Academy Lecture, sponsored by the English Academy of Southern Africa, on 4 April, 1990, in Cape Town.
