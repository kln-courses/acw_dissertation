<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Applied Philosophy, Vol. 15, No. 2, 1998 The Origin and End of Modernity BRIAN TRAINOR ABSTRACT In this article, I suggest that post-modernism is in essence a return, under radically different circumstances and with a cultural inheritance from the modernist era (especially the 'modernist' principle of freedom of the individual), to a kind of (post-modernist) medievalism. The view that the 'trend of our times' is towards a 'post-modern medievalism' is based mainly upon a consideration of the decline of the nation-state, the replacement of 'absolute' with a kind of 'moderated' national sovereignty and the fact that the nations and regional assemblies of Europe are beginning to look increasingly like the duchies and baronies of feudal Europe. (An asterisk after a term indicates that it is being used in a gender inclusive sense.) What is modernity and when did it begin? Is it over, a completed 'phase' in the history of humanity or is it, as Habermas would say, an 'incomplete project'? Can we characterise 'modernity' as a kind of womb which contains within itself all the potentialities of a new post-modernist era, and which, in the fulness of time (the present time?), just before it passes into oblivion after fulfilling its historic task, naturally gives birth to a new cultural formation called 'post-modernism'? Clearly, in order to answer these questions, the key concept that we need to investigate here is 'modernism', for as well as describing the condition in which we are (or are supposed to be) in, it is sometimes used to describe the preceding period (i.e. the pre-'modern' period) as one which anticipates the emergence of (full blown) modernity, and of course it is very frequently used to characterise the period following modernity as post-'modern', i.e. not as something completely new, requiring a name which eliminates all reference to the 'modern', but as either (i) a continuation in some way of the 'modern' or (ii) as an anti-climax post-dating the 'modern' and living in its shadow or even (iii) as a hopeless struggle against the persistent strength and resilience of the 'modern'. Given the centrality of the 'modern' in the trilogy 'pre-modern/modern/ post-modern', it is of the utmost importance to focus our intellectual efforts on the two crucial transitions implied in the trilogy, i.e., from 'pre-modern' to 'modern' and from 'modern' to 'post-modern'. By doing so, by considering the origin and end of modernity, we are likely to get a better and clearer idea of what it is. I shall suggest in this article that the sense of direction that we feel as we follow in thought the transition from 'pre-modern' to 'modern' tends to reverse itself when we proceed to consider the transition from 'modern' to 'post-modern'. If we call the pre modern period 'medieval', and call the beginnings of modernism the point at which there was a radical rupture with medievalism, then the sense of 'reverse direction' which we feel when we contemplate the transition to postmodernity surely entitles us to refer to postmodernism as a form of 'modern medievalism' or, less elegantly, as 'medievalism under modern conditions of freedom'. © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998, Blackwell Publishers, 108 Cowley Road, Oxford, 0X4 1JF, UK and 350 Main Street, Maiden, MA 02148, USA.</page><page sequence="2">134 B. Trainor (i) From 'enveloping Nature' to 'enveloping Nature' In pre-modern or feudal Europe, prior to the emergence of the individualistic attitudes that accompanied the widespread introduction of modern, industrial methods of production, man* conceived of himself* as an integral part of Nature, as being encircled or enveloped by Nature, so to speak. This view expresses what we might call the natural conviction of humanity, i.e., the almost 'instinctual' beliefs not just of pre-modern but also of pre-feudal men'. This 'natural' conception or understanding of man's* inner, spiritual connection with a 'Nature' that transcends and yet also includes his* being was reinforced by medieval Christianity, thereby forming what the modernist would regard as an 'unholy alliance' which it took the full vigour of the Age of Reason and Enlightenment to 'defeat'. Certainly, it is but a small step from thinking of 'Nature' as the pervasive pattern or order of the world, as its designing Spirit, as the integrative process which assigns to each of 'its' species its proper place in the scheme of things, or as Life itself, as the womb or mother from whom all life flows, to thinking of Nature under the influence of Christianity as the all-pervasive Spirit of Life (the Holy Spirit, as Lord and Giver of life) sustaining all living things and providing the principle of unity to the wondrous diversity of the world. [1] We may at any rate summarise the pre-modern or medieval view as the conviction (an assumption implicit in the mode of experiencing feudal life) that all living things participate in their own way in the Divine Life and that in so doing they, in a sense, 'live the Life of God'. This view was of course forthrightly rejected by the moderns, especially and most notably by John Locke, who set the tone for later Enlightenment, modernist thinkers. Under the shadow of Hobbes, Locke divorced man* from Nature and transformed the latter into a realm of brute facts or a storehouse of physical entities to be 'appropriated' by human beings and made into their 'private' property. With Locke, the medieval ideal of co operation with Nature, of respect for all forms of life as emanating from a single source, gives way to the modernist ideal of conquest and technical mastery of nature. Locke's 'state of nature' is one in which men* (moral persons) originally inhabit an amoral world and by various external means (by mixing the labour of their hands with physical objects) manage to incorporate 'things' into their internal moral universe and impart a moral quality to objects/entities (i.e., being rightfully 'owned' by discrete persons) which they originally lacked [2]. 'Nature' as an ideal system of co-operative relations between different species/forms of life which are all equally members of a common universe, or 'Nature' as a model (divinely instituted) of integrative relations which are both descriptive of the actual relations which generally do obtain, as a matter of fact, in the world and prescriptive for men* who, through their freedom, may ignore or distort these relations, is for Locke little more than a medieval relic. However, it is precisely this relic which reappears as a central conviction and guiding principle of postmodernist consciousness. The modernist endorsement of the 'conquest of nature', and its understanding of 'progress' as meaning ever greater achievements in this regard, is dismissed as a dangerous and destructive phallocentric myth by exponents of the conservation and 'green' movements [3], Medieval 'Nature' is thus reborn as postmodernist environmentalism. At this point, it is necessary to pause for a moment to consider our usage of key terms. If an important part of what we mean by 'modernist' is an intellectual endorsement of the project of mastering nature by technological means, and if we understand by 'postmodernist' a return, at least in certain key respects, to a medieval (pre-modern) © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="3">The Origin and End of Modernity 135 conception of man* and Nature, then surely we would have to agree that postmodernism and modernism are 'twins', that modernism actually provokes postmodernism as an immediate, almost spontaneous reaction. After all, Locke's view of nature and the acquisition of private property was forthrightly rejected by Rousseau, for whom a separation between man* and Nature was anathema. Must we not say then that Locke was a modernist and Rousseau a postmodernist? The simple answer is 'yes'. I believe that Lyotard is correct, helpful and illuminating in holding that the 'post-modern' cannot be separated from, though it must be distinguished from the 'modern', and that the 'post modern' is present from the very beginning in the 'modern' and gradually makes its presence increasingly evident. However, it is one thing to characterise aspects of a thinker's work as 'modernist' or 'postmodernist' and quite another thing to characterise historical periods as 'modernist' or 'postmodernist'. Writers such as Hobbes and Locke, in breaking decisively with the medieval world view, were modernist writers at the dawn of the modernist 'wave of thought'; they inaugurated modernism whereas Rousseau anticipated postmodernism, for he was the first of a number of thinkers whose writings ultimately helped to bring about the collapse of that modernist 'wave' of thinking. Before long, Locke's views were to become intellectually paradigmatic and culturally prescriptive, whereas Rousseau's ideas, though obviously important and influential as a countervailing intellectual force, were nevertheless clearly relegated to the role of resistance, like a 'postmodernist shadow' struggling to displace its 'modernist substance'. In certain crucial respects then (I have in mind especially Rousseau's views on property and the man* — Nature nexus as expressed in his Discourse on the Origin of Inequality [4]), Rousseau was postmodernist; there may even perhaps be some basis for the claim that he inaugurated a postmodernist tradition of thought or that he can be credited with initiating an undercurrent of intellectual resistance to modernism, but no-one surely would suggest that he lived in or inaugurated a postmodernist era. Today, in contrast, Rousseau's noble savage, living in a simple, natural, symbiotic relationship with his environment, like a fish in the water or a bird in the air, is a cultural hero of the western world and the medieval/postmodernist view of Nature has become intellectually ascendant and culturally prescriptive. Curiously, despite the fact that Rousseau portrayed his noble savage as a kind of thoroughly instinctual, amoral creature, he now stands firmly and proudly on the high moral ground, casting his shadow of censure on the Lockean modernists in the valley below; the latter now stand condemned of espousing an industrial/technological culture which legitimised the rape of the earth by calling it 'progress'. The most that can be said for these unfortunate modernists (for so they are regarded in the present, postmodernist climate) is that, blinded by the false moral ideal of progress (and of 'conquest' over nature), they mistakenly regarded their reckless plunder of nature as an amoral and thus blameless enterprise. 'Nature', it would seem, has returned with a vengeance; so too, at least up to a point, has 'reason as participation'. (ii) From 'enveloping Reason' to 'enveloping Reason'? 'Reason' and 'Nature' are closely, even symbiotically linked, as are our conceptions of both. I have suggested that in the medieval world, 'Nature' was understood or experienced as an ordering, enveloping, unifying process which assigned to each species, including the human, its proper place in the natural or divine — but, at any rate intelligible — scheme of © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="4">136 B. Trainor things. In this medieval universe, reasoning was generally conceived of as a mode of participation engaged in by each form of life as it lived, in its own species-determined and species-appropriate way, the 'life' of an all-encompassing Nature or World Soul (what later became known as 'the Absolute'). By achieving greater clarity of thought and feeling, man* lives that life more fully, with greater self-consciousness and with a greater understanding and awareness that the self, though substantive, individual and real, yet lives the life of 'Substance' itself, of Reality itself, or of the Spirit that pervades the whole or, rather, it realises that it is substantive and individual only by virtue of its relation to the whole, its communion with and participation in the whole through the medium of reason, spirit and thought. In this, the middle ages was at one with Plato and Aristotle, who understood God as the one supreme unchanging Being to whose presence the world responds with the whole process of cosmic development. For Aristotle, God 'moves' both Nature and human thought by being its good whilst Plato held that human reasoning, according to nature or under the influence of the 'good' (or the 'Absolute') not only responds to the Divine, so that it is the effect or manifestation of the prompting of the Divine, but that it actually participates in the life of the Divine. For Plato and Aristotle then, human reasoning is deeply implicated in the Divine but we should also note that this intellectual or philosophical conviction of the middle ages was reinforced by Christianity, for the immanent totality of 'Nature' was deemed to be a single totality (a uni-verse) precisely because of the indwelling of the (Holy) Spirit and Divine reason in man* and in all living things. Even were I competent to do so, this is obviously not the place to document the history of reason in the modernist period — a period which, in my view, begins with William of Ockham's early challenge to the intellectual ascendancy of Greek thought but which develops a 'paradigm-shattering' momentum and impetus around the time of Hobbes's 'trumpet blast for modernity' in 1651, the publication date of his Leviathan. However, it would, I believe, be broadly true to say that at the time, and from the time, of Descartes and Hobbes, 'reason' becomes 'unhinged'; it literally breaks loose from the cosmic order, an order which henceforth is no longer seen as inherently rational. The medieval view is decisively rejected: the modernist attitude is to regard the view that Divine Reason percolates through the entire cosmic order, (including the reasoning of man* as an integral part of that order) as unscientific and unsustainable, as no more indeed than a relic of medieval anthropomorphism that deserves to perish in an age of scientific enlightenment. The cost is high, however, for the 'real' cosmic order of medieval thought, an order of interconnected essences and real kinds, becomes replaced under the banner of enlight enment and scientific progress with the modernist mathematical universe of matter-in motion inhabited by Galileo, Descartes and Hobbes. At any rate, from its inception, when it set 'reason' adrift in the universe, a virtually constant feature of modernity has been its attempt to find some kind of secure foundation for human thought, or to somehow come to grips with its declared absence. In retrospect, it now looks as if this modernist project was always doomed to be a hopeless endeavour. Hobbes declared that knowledge did at least have some secure foundations, that we at least know with certainty what we make ourselves (geometrical figures and Commonwealths) and that we ourselves are made up of 'matter-in-motion', and that 'reasoning' is valid and productive if it proceeds (deductively) from this solid basis, though he failed to realise that his materialistic monism destroyed the integrity of our minds as minds. Hume frankly acknowledged that there is no secure bedrock for human thought to rest on and Kant, in dismay, sought to © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="5">The Origin and End of Modernity 137 find such a bedrock in the concepts and categories of 'pure reason'. But once 'pure reason' has gone adrift in mental space, the way is cleared for an endless, hopeless and unproductive 'battle' between empiricism and rationalism (the two prongs of Hume's fork) and it is hard to see how Kant can save us, for why after all should we put our faith in these 'necessary' ideas which we simply cannot help thinking? In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, existentialism offered a more emotional, 'existential', deeply personal reaction to the apparent lack of any foundation in the modern world for human life and thought; there was felt to be no source or wellspring which would guarantee the validity of human thought, the significance of human knowledge and the point of human existence. From the perspective of postmodernity, all of the above now appear as 'gyrations of thought' moving within the modernist orbit and as the full working out of the consequences of unhinging reason from the cosmic order. In his well-known attacks on foundationalism [5], Richard Rorty simply hammers a few more nails into modernism's futile 'foundational project'. It seems to me that at the present time there is scarcely any live resistance to his attacks. Interestingly, in the pre modern world, no-one bothered to 'look for' foundations for human thought and life; only the free-floating reason of the modernist does such a strange thing. Hopefully, what we are now beginning to see is that reasoning does not need a foundation; it needs a home or, to be more precise, it does not require a foundation in the sense of an unshakable basis from which, once found, reasoning can proceed deductively thereafter with unassailable certainty, but rather a foundational faith or acknowledgement that the world is its homeland. Human reasoning ideally should move in the spiritual medium of the universe, recognising itself in and through the objects of its world. Hopefully, too, we have now learnt the 'hard lessons' that modernity has taught us. We now accept that there is of course no such thing as theoretical certainty, no certain truths expressed by a priori propositions, no certainty even that 'I am' or that 'I think', no certainty that we are not puppets of the Great Deceiver. There is a strong natural conviction, built into our language of reason, that we are not deceived, but once the universal self has taken a stand in thought outside of nature, the world and the flow of life, then the only route back to life, back home so to speak, is through an act of faith of some kind. Strictly speaking, we can never know (with a sense of certainty) but can only acknowledge (in faith), that our reason participates in the Divine Reason and that the flow of our thoughts mirrors, or is at the very least an echo of, the real rhythms of our universe. We are in the curious situation where our thoughts spontaneously extend themselves into their world, into the external world of objects which it spontaneously grasps (we hope) in knowledge and yet where the possibility of our standing over against the world (and our thinking about the world) engenders the dizzying, self-destructive thought that perhaps it is all an illusion and that what our thoughts spontaneously rush 'out' to grasp is not really 'there'; we thus confront the stark possibility that our minds want, and therefore invent, an intelligible world. Certainly, the possibility has to be acknowledged but, curiously, Nature as our Mother and Nature as an illusion of the Great Deceiver both demand faith of us, for we know neither that we are deceived, nor that we are not deceived. This is where the real choice lies; this is what the era of modernity makes palpably clear and our awareness makes us post-modern. At the present time, one would expect a post-modern society or culture to be increasingly conscious of the weaknesses and generally deleterious consequences of a modernist conception of reason which cuts our reason adrift from the universe and to be increasingly sympathetic towards a conception of'Reason' as enveloping both the universe © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="6">138 B. Trainor and each reflective (and ethical) self, so that our reason can once again find its home in the world. If we regard an intellectual tendency of this kind as a benchmark of 'postmodernity', then it would seem that we do not live in a post-modern era (or at least not in a thoroughly 'postmodernised' era) but that we live in an era of conflicting philosophico-cultural possibilities. It is by no means clear, for example, that we are currently witnessing the resurrection of 'enveloping Reason' out of the ashes of 'modernist reason'. With respect to this benchmark, then, we are not postmodernist — or at least we are not clearly and unambiguously so — and this has mainly to do with our attitude to what Lyotard calls 'metanarratives'. Lyotard actually sees the central feature of a postmodernist culture as its incredulity with regard to metanarratives [6] but in this I think that he is mistaken; indeed I would go so far as to suggest that incredulity with respect to the metanarratives of our culture is a hallmark, and continuing legacy, of modernity. If a despairing recognition that there is no foundation for human thought and life is a mark of modernity, a mood and mode of thinking which moves within the modernist orbit, then so too is a profoundly suspicious attitude to metanarratives, for both are ultimately effects — the fragmenting debris — of the breaking loose of reason from the cosmic order. A metanarrative tells a story that intertwines humanity into its world, thereby recognising and celebrating a real connection: it links our origin and destiny with the origin and destiny of a universe that is ours. Thus, for example, those who, in opposition to Paul Feyerabend, tell the story of the progress of science, celebrate a world in which the 'scientific mind' is at home and whose rhythms it can discover ever more about, if it listens patiently and attentively. Those who tell the story of the rebirth of our 'green' consciousness of 'Nature' out of the ashes of the 'nature as alien other to be conquered and exploited' mentality, celebrate a world in which our whole human existence, our thoughts and emotions, is integral to the life of Nature as a whole; and, to take one last example, those who tell the story of the emergence of a liberated consciousness that questions sexual stereotypes and challenges patriarchy, celebrate a world in which individuals are at least potentially free to be who they really are. It would seem then that metanarratives abound at the present time and that there is good reason to hope that we are entering a genuinely post-modern era where the metanarratives of religion, science and social theory flourish alongside each other and where, in dialogue, we attempt to distil the important aspect of the truth (of each 'face' of 'Nature', so to speak) that each metanarrative has to reveal to us. The greatest obstacle at the present time to the full flowering of post-modern metanarratives is the influence on our culture of the 'late modern' tendency to hold that any commitment of any sort to any project, (or to any metanarrative which spawns 'meaningful' projects in the world), is simply unjustifiable. We are encouraged to believe that all human projects ultimately lack any real foundation or any meaning-engendering links to an enveloping scheme (and source) of significance (Nature, the Divine, the Absolute, etc.). In 'late modernism' an anguished existentialism that still felt 'the necessity to choose' and to be committed to one's choices, that held that one might be able to at least make, if one could not find, a home in the universe, gives way to a form of existentialism that hangs suspended above the world, playfully taking on or toying with commitments to avoid boredom (what else is there to do?) but never taking them seriously. It is important to note that late modernity's incredulity with respect to metanarratives and its attitude to commitment, its refusal to take any metanarratives seriously, are opposite sides of the same coin; the late modernist (admittedly, more generally seen at the present time as the postmodernist) simultaneously detaches and (provisionally) attaches himself* to human © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="7">The Origin and End of Modernity 139 projects, letting us know that any apparent seriousness of intent with regard to the commitments engendered by such projects was not (of course) seriously intended. How, after all, could one possibly be serious about such things? There are, after all, no unshakable foundations, and no aspects of the truth of the human condition which 'project and commitment inspiring metanarratives' could reveal. Metanarratives are, at best, the human imagination at play, creating worlds of significance for those who live in them and generating meaningful projects on their behalf. These worlds are a source of playful interest, perhaps even of fascination for the liberal minded late modernist. He* really is quite fond of Mother Teresa in his* own way and the last vestiges of a vague humanism may even prompt him* to identify himself* with the concerns of those who live in these (metanarrative-generated) significant worlds, but only temporarily, provisionally and without any seriousness of intent. In brief, the late modernist does not live in, but merely visits, our common, human world. (iii) From Pre-modera to Post-modern Medievalism In this era of conflicting philosophico-cultural possibilities, where on the one hand metanarratives abound and flourish whilst, on the other hand, a late modernist mood of lassitude would have us believe that we are now post histoire (that we are now above and beyond metanarrative-inspired 'causes' and 'projects'), it is hopefully the latter's influence on the intellectual climate and its general 'cultural prescriptivity' that is on the wane. In this section, I wish to suggest that the fact that the present, culturally ascendant 'Nature' metanarrative seems to be so obviously a part of a wider movement of thought and feeling, of a shift in sentiment, both widespread and profound, away from a modernism which rejected pre-modern medievalism in favour of a 'post-modern medievalism', provides grounds for the belief that this hope is not without foundation. I will put forward the view that postmodernism is, in essence, a return, under radically different circumstances (and no doubt engendered in part by those circumstances) and with a cultural inheritance from the modernist era (especially the 'modernist' principle of freedom of the individual), to a kind of (postmodernist) medievalism. The view that the 'trend of our times' is towards a 'post-modern medievalism' is based upon a consideration of the following features of industrially advanced liberal-democratic societies, though not regarded in isolation from each other but regarded, in what I hope is an illuminating way, as instances of a definite cultural-political movement in a single direction. Let us begin with the nation-state. Although the direction of causation is difficult to determine it is at least clear that the emergence of the nation state and the decline of the medieval world are closely linked. In feudal Europe, prior to the emergence of modern nation states, it would on the whole be true to say that persons felt a strong sense of allegiance and belonging to their local community — so strong indeed that it would hardly have been recognised as such but would have lain beneath the level of their conscious thoughts. The 'gemeinschaft' quality of the feudal community enveloped their whole lives; the routines and rules of daily living were governed by age-old traditions (the 'eternal yesterday') and the borderline between the personal/private and the communal/public realms was very hazy indeed — so much so, in fact, that many would argue that the distinction itself, and especially its clarity and definiteness, is a 'modernist' phenomenon. Likewise, the idea of individuals having rights that are exercisable against society sounds © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="8">140 B. Trainor distinctly 'unfeudal' and modernist, for all rights in a feudal society were the socially regulated 'gifts' of age old traditions. 'Individualism' in the modern sense simply cannot take root in truly feudal soil. There was also a sense in feudal times of the local community being a particularisation of, or a 'world' enveloped within, a wider, universal world order (mainly the universal order of the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic Church). Couched within their hierarchically organised feudal structure, local ('micro'-) commu nities with their 'seigneurs' were tied by feudal obligations to ever wider ('macro'-) communities that arose above and beyond them, so that individuals had the sense of being members both of their local community and citizens (or 'subjects') of the feudal world. There was simply no place in this world either for the modern, autonomous 'free' individual or the modern nation-state. To the medieval, pre-modern mind, the latter could only appear as a kind of monstrous impossibility, somehow (but how?) possessing the self containedness of the universe as a whole, and somehow independent and sovereign in relation to the universal order of the feudal world — but how? — for it is the overarching, enveloping order which legitimises and imparts significance to the day-to-day life and ongoing traditions of each local community. The idea of a 'sovereign nation state', translated, so to speak, into the feudal world, would have been seen as sundering important ties of feudal obligation and as cutting off the flow from the 'universal' into the 'particular'. At the present time, the sense of attachment to the modern, sovereign nation state seems to be in decline, as Europe heads rapidly towards a new medievalism which, like the old, regards the sovereign, fully autonomous and independent nation state with profound suspicion as an obstacle impeding the flow from the 'universal' into the 'particular'. The sense of 'being a people', a political community with strong historical traditions and roots, seems to be as vibrant as ever but at the present time 'nationhood' and 'being a people' seem to be drifting apart; the former is no longer regarded as being a prerequisite for the latter. The Scottish National Party, for example, seeks to achieve, not 'national independence', as its name might suggest, but the kind of relative autonomy (a 'moderated sovereignty') that would be given to the 'people of Scotland' as full members, in their own right, of the European union. The nations and regional assemblies of Europe are beginning to look increasingly like the duchies and baronies of feudal Europe. Even just twenty years ago, very few would have been brave or foolhardy enough to advocate greater European integration in a political sense; it would have been seen as undermining 'national sovereignty', the common assumption being of course that the latter was an indisputable 'good' to be preserved at all costs. What was widely advocated, precisely because it did not challenge national sovereignty, was greater political co operation between wholly sovereign, autonomous states. This of course, is the view currently entertained by the Eurosceptics in the British Conservative party but in espousing it, they seem to be struggling valiantly against the momentum of history, against what seems to be a drift towards some form of world community. Since the United States originated as a federation of the erstwhile British colonies, Americans have not been as fixated as their European counterparts with the issue of national sovereignty and with the task (some would say hopeless) of pinpointing a single, indivisible source of sovereignty. There is in the U.S. not only a sense of being a member of a particular political community, recognised in institutional terms in the relative political autonomy exercised by each state, but also a sense of being 'one people' which the federal structure facilitates and which makes the U.S. capable of acting in a concerted way as one political body. However, there are, in the U.S., I would suggest, fewer and fewer who © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="9">The Origin and End of Modernity 141 would hold that an autonomous, sovereign nation is an absolutely indispensable institutional expression of the 'sense of being a people'. It seems that those responsible for the Oklahoma bombing were of this persuasion, ie., that there is an indissoluble link between 'peoplehood' and 'sovereign nationhood', and that they were convinced that the United Nations, in threatening the latter, also threatened the cherished freedoms of the former, but this in itself is surely testimony to the fact that there is in the U.S. a strong developing sense of its membership of a world community and that there is a greater preparedness to consider what implications this emerging trend might have for the issue of national sovereignty. There is then, I would suggest, in each of the industrial, liberal democracies of the world, an emerging sense of being 'parts' of a universal 'whole', of a kind of 'world mosaic'. This consciousness of living in a world which subsists within, and is enveloped by, ever wider worlds can, I believe, be best characterised and described as a 'modern medievalist' (or 'postmodernist') consciousness. It is important to note that the 'decline' of the nation-state (and the 'relativising' of its sovereignty) in no way undermines the idea and the necessity of the 'state' per se [7], If we consider the state as 'a society or people organised on its own behalf or as 'the own self of a people' or, more broadly still, as 'that which bears authoritatively, and if necessary with coercive force, upon the life of people as a whole' [8], then in one sense the 'modern' and 'post-modern' state are identical, for that which bears most authoritatively and significantly upon the life of a people is (and still remains) its legal and political institutions and its general culture. Increasingly, however, the latter are being regarded as the 'prism' or media of the international community. The fact that members of states have a more and more pronounced 'regional' and 'world' consciousness obviously has a bearing on how the state itself is understood. There are, of course, those who would say that 'nothing has changed'. Eurosceptics in the British Conservative party would no doubt insist that the 'world' is no more than a system of fully sovereign states and that international relations should be governed by contractual (treaty) obligations which promote the interests of all nations whilst in no way affecting or diminishing their national sovereignty. The current trend, however, seems to be towards a less contractual/atomistic and more organic/'substantive' view of the international community, one which raises complex questions about the (post) modern state, its role as a medium of the international community and the source of its authority when it acts in the latter capacity. In one way, the authority exercised by the state (or by a government acting in the name of the state) is always fully its own, deriving from the will and consent of its 'own' people, but given the 'world consciousness' of its own people and the fact that they increasingly see themselves as members of a world community, state authority almost becomes a kind of delegated authority. It is as if the 'own self of a people, whilst substantive and real, must nevertheless be viewed as an aspect of and as being symbiotically linked to, the will of the world community (a world 'soul', 'spirit' or 'substance'), so that the state's actions concerning matters of world significance (the environment, human rights) possess authority and legitimacy to the extent that they are genuine 'particularisations' of the 'universal will' of the international community. As another instance of this emerging 'modern medievalism', let us consider the attitude which prevails at the present time towards land and property (corporate and individual) and which has clearly been influenced by the new metanarrative of 'Nature' we discussed in the first section. The medieval view was that God had given the earth to men* in common, so that no single person could be said to 'own' land. Even a community, strictly © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="10">142 B. Trainor speaking, could not be said to 'own' land, for God had given the earth to humanity on trust, to be properly used to meet the daily human needs of every member of the hierarchical feudal community. Needless to say, Locke's famous justification of private property (i.e. of the right to the exclusive use of land that one has mixed one's labour with) exercised a kind of cultural hegemony during the modernist era, during which time it successfully held at bay (in a cultural sense) successive waves of withering socialist critique. It would, I believe, be true to say that today Locke's 'bourgeois' property rights are more strongly entrenched and culturally respected than ever but the freedom allowed by these semi-sovereign rights of ownership is today counterbalanced by a very strong emphasis on the social responsibility of owners, whether individual or corporate. 'Owner' is now more than ever tinged with an aura of social responsibility. The reason, I believe, is that the pre modern, indeed pre-feudal, elemental sense of the earth being 'our Mother' has in recent times re-emerged and acquired such a force and intensity in the popular consciousness that very few would be so foolhardy as to claim that property rights convey the (irresponsible) right to do what one likes with one's own. Increasingly, there is the sense that for something to be truly 'one's own', it must be regarded as a kind of heritage or trust exercised on behalf of humanity as a whole and this feeling naturally diminishes the legitimacy of, and public tolerance of the claim to, sovereign rights over property. 'Sovereignty', whether in relation to 'property' or 'nations' seems to be yielding to a looser notion of 'relative autonomy' or perhaps we could say that the (modernist) 'form' of sovereignty is increasingly 'filled' with a socially aware and socially responsible 'substance'. We seem then to have a return, under modern conditions of freedom, to the pre-modern, and indeed pre-feudal aboriginal view that we are really 'owned by' the land and property we claim to 'own'. It is interesting to note in passing that in Australia there has been a complete swing of the pendulum, so to speak from the attitude of condescension shown by the modernist, Lockean, Protestant industrializing invaders towards Aboriginal society, religion and culture (and towards the feudal Irish Catholics who likewise ungraciously refused to accept the gift of higher civilisation offered to them by the establishment [9]) to the widespread respect currently accorded to Aboriginal spirituality (and to Ned Kelly, who has only recently been transformed from a cultural villain into the cultural hero, not just of the Catholic Irish but of 'post-modern' Australia as a whole). If we consider prevalent notions of corporate social responsibility, we find that the current trend is for corporate managers to follow the model of Japan's feudal-style capitalism and to treat their employees both as 'whole persons', with their own important social responsibilities to fulfil, and as members of the organic corporate 'community' of the firm. The current cultural tendency then is to regard workers, not in the modernist manner as employees contractually related through a cash nexus to employers, but rather in the modern medievalist or post-modern manner as members of a corporate community. One could of course cynically refer to this trend as 'economic rationalism with a human face', as merely a recognition on the part of management that those who feel they are members of the firm will generally be more productive and creative than those on short term contracts but a less cynical interpretation would be to say that the current trend is the natural outgrowth of economic rationalism, that it is 'modernism' finding its 'true self in 'postmodernism' or the individualistic principle of freedom being exercised in a socially responsible way. The more optimistic view that I am recommending would take seriously Hegel's point that 'the principle of modern states has prodigious strength and depth because it allows the principle of subjectivity to progress to its culmination in the extreme © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="11">The Origin and End of Modernity 143 of self-subsistent particularity, and yet at the same time brings it back to the substantive unity and so maintains this unity in the principle of subjectivity itself [10]. In this regard, Joanne Ciulla makes the important point that both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, whilst certainly believing in liberal economics, also entertained an ardent desire to make the private sector assume greater public responsibilities. As she points out, Ronald Reagan pursued a policy of cutting government spending on welfare whilst encouraging business to support the arts and social programmes. Thus the public philosophy of Reagan and Thatcher 'gave business more power, but it also had the consequence of giving business more social obligations. This is ironic because, in the past, social critics feared that without tight restrictions, businesses would exploit the labour force and destroy the social, moral and aesthetic fabric of society'. [11] We do indeed live in a strange new world, which is yet reminiscent of the old world our ancestors left as they ventured forth into modernity, though it is a world which, as Ciulla points out, the political left is laboriously slow in coming to grips with [12]. A more general way of characterising the transitions from (i) the pre-modern to the modern and (ii) from the modern to the post-modern would be to say that they are transitions from (i) the kind of 'order of necessity' that characterises subsistence level societies to the 'order of freedom' that characterises the industrial, affluent societies of modernity, and then (ii) from the latter to an order of'willed necessity, to societies where freedom is more generally exercised (or at least this increasingly becomes a major, culturally prescriptive expectation) in accordance with the requirements (even the 'demands' or 'necessity') of social responsibility. But what, in more practical and precise terms, are these requirements? How do we reconcile the benefits of modernist economic development with the environmental sensitivities of postmodernism? Does feminist 'pro choice' presuppose a modernist, Lockean conception of the body as one's own exclusive private property and of 'nature' as an externality to be appropriated, in contrast to a post modern 'pro-life' conception of 'nature' as enveloping the self, and of the unborn child as properly embedded in its womb, its family and its world? ... or should we perhaps regard the current post-modern sensitivity to embeddedness and to the requirements of 'enveloping Nature' as the true or ideal substance of such formal liberal freedoms as the 'right to choose'? These questions are pressing and serious but the playfulness and ironical posturing of late modernism, and its general incredulity with respect to metanarratives are hardly likely to help us to find the best answers. We need as many critical analyses as possible of our (post-modern) condition, each, we would hope, presenting a reflective illumination of that condition and together helping us to secure the most comprehensive vision possible of our current situation and its problems. In short, what we need is a post modern world in which metanarratives (social, religious and scientific) abound.

NOTES [1] In holding that there is a transcendental Creator-God, Christianity has nothing in common with the 'natural beliefs' of humanity, but in holding that God is also immanent and indwelling in all living forms in the world, Christianity entirely coincides with these natural beliefs and reinforces them where its influence is felt. © Society for Applied Philosophy, 1998</page><page sequence="12">144 B.
