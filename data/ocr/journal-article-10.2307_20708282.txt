Historians and archaeologists have long been fascinated by the period A.D. 1400-1700 in the Midwest. Native American and European contact caused social re organization that brought cultural and demographic change. This symposium will present current archaeological and historical research on this crucial period. Hall, Robert (University of Iltinois-Chkago) RECOGNIZING CONTINUITIES OF BELIEF AND RITUAL THROUGH TIME IN ILLINOIS ARCHAEOLOGY The process of recognizing the symbolism of archaeological artifacts and struc tures can be regularized and reduced to a series of systematic steps, knowledge of which can benefit the total process of archaeological inference. Examples are given of the successful application of these principles in Illinois archaeology and of chains of in ference still awaiting final resolution. Millier, George R. (Pennsylvania State University) POPULATION DYNAMICS AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION. The critical relationships among population density, sociocultural complexity, and the adaptive stance of past peoples continue to be the subject of considerable anthropological study. Archaeologists with their long temporal sequences should be able to make major contributions to this research area. Two population-related issues that are the subject of recent attention elsewhere in eastern North America are reviewed in terms of their implications for midwestem archaeologists. First, an argument is made for the treatment of the organizationally complex Mississippian cultures as dynamic systems featuring continually changing social landscapes and population distributions. Second, there is a critical need for epidemiologically sophisticated models when evaluating the processes of postcontact depopulation and cultural collapse.

(Luther College) THE ADAPTIVE PATTERNING OF THE DHEGIHA SIOUX. The beginning student in anthropology is taught that culture is traditional and that traditional elements can be derived in study of closely-related groups of people. Related, traditional elements should be derived in analysis of the archaeological remains of the linguistically-related Quapaw, Osage, Kansa, Omaha and Ponca tribal units, which date historically in the 17th and early 18th centuries, but significantly different cultural traditions are represented by this time. Locational information, cultural relationships and some explanatory hypotheses are offered. Cowan, C. Wesley (Cincinnati Museum of Natural History) FROM PITHOUSE TO LONGHOUSE, FROM COMMUNITY TO CHAOS: Late Prehistoric and Early Protohistork Developments in the Middle Ohio Valley. This paper focuses on the late prehistoric and early historic cultural developments in the central Ohio Valley, an area encompassing the Ohio River Valley and its tribu taries between present-day Parkersburg, West Virginia and Louisville, Kentucky. Dur ing the period between A.D. 1000 and 1670, this portion of the Valley witnessed the growth and decline of maize-based agricultural societies. By A.D. 1670 much of the central valley was abandoned; historically recorded Native American societies did not return until the first few decades of the 18th century. These so-called tribal societies stand in sharp contrast to their late prehistoric counterparts in other areas of the midwest and southeast, where complex chiefly organizations developed. Changes in settlement patterns, architectural styles, mortuary patterns, and material culture are presented to document the rise and fall of mese societies. Emerson, Thomas E. (Illinois State Preservation Agency) A SYNCHRONIC PERSPECTIVE ON CULTURE, POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT IN THE LATE PREHISTORY OF ILLINOIS. The late prehistoric and protohistoric transitional period is one of the least understood in Illinois archaeology. It is clear, however, that there was a major disruption of cultural development and continuity in most of the state during the 15th century. At the same time, aboriginal groups in the northeastern portion of the state appear unaf fected. This paper will synthesize the available information on these late prehistoric groups and their subsequent decline, focusing on the factors of climate, environmental degradation, population stress, disease, and warfare in influencing cultural change.

(Southern Illinois Unrversity-Edwardsville) THE EAST ST. LOUIS MOUND GROUP AND THE RAU COLLECTION. The East St. Louis Mound group was one of the five major Mississippian mound centers in the American Bottom. All of the mounds were apparently removed during the latter half of the nineteenth century. This presentation will summarize the history of investigations at this site and, in particular, describe the materials collected by Dr. Charles Rau during the 1860s and their importance in assessing the chronological placement of this center. Redmond, Brian (Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology) CERAMIC STYLE AND SOCIAL FUNCTION: Yankeetown Phase Pottery Dec oration and Emergent Mississippian Social Interaction in the Lower Ohio Valley. In this paper the results of a stylistic analysis of Yankeetown Phase pottery are presented and used to evaluate current models of Emergent Mississippian social inter action in the lower Ohio Valley. It is proposed that the Yankeetown ceramic style may have functioned as a medium for the exchange of information pertaining to group identity and fostered social integration on both a local and regional level through the display of distinctive decorative motifs. Lynott, Mark J. (National Park Service), and James E. Price (University of Missouri-Columbia) THE EMERGENT MISSISSIPPIAN SUBSTAGE AND EASTERN OZARK ADAPTIVE PATTERNS, SOUTHEAST MISSOURI. The appearance of shell tempered ceramics and arrow points about A.D. 600 resulted in negligible changes in the human adaptive strategies of the eastern Ozark region of southeast Missouri. Throughout the Emergent Mississippian substage, set tlement and subsistence practices in this region continued to follow strategies which had been well established for several thousand years. Archeological evidence from the Upper Current River drainage indicates the eastern Ozark region was abandoned by indigenous populations about A.D. 1300. The archeological evidence leading up to this abandon ment is considered. Schurr, Mark R. (Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology) MORTUARY TREATMENT AND PREHISTORIC DIET AT THE ANGEL SITE. The different mortuary categories present at the Angel site, a Middle Mississip pian regional center in southwestern Indiana, are determined primarily by differences in body position. Mortuary variation is not correlated with dietary variation measured by the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of prehistoric bone collagen from 40 individuals. The stable isotope ratios indicate a relatively high dependence on maize and very little dietary variation except for one anomalous individual from a peculiar mor tuary context.</page><page sequence="4">MIDWEST CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS 93 H?geman, Sherri L. (Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology) ANGEL NEGATIVE PAINTED DESIGN STRUCTURE. Decorative styles have been described as complex patterns constructed from smaller elements of design. Analysis of the Angel Negative Painted style suggests that a limited number of design elements are arranged around the rim of a plate, so that the plate generally represents a radiating circle or an equal-arm cross. This design structure suggests these plates may have been ritual serving vessels during a local version of the green corn or new fire ceremony. Esarey, Duane (Dickson Mounds Museum) NEGATIVE PAINTED POTTERY AND MISSISSIPPIAN TRADE IN THE ILLINOIS RIVER VALLEY. Many of the finest Middle Mississippian ceremonial and status goods found in the Illinois River Valley have traditionally been assumed to be indicative of trade rather than local production of "core Mississippian" art. Unfortunately, the perception that trade explains the presence of these items can be taken as support for the view that local Mississippian social patterning is somehow marginal and diluted in symbolic content. Trade almost certainly must be the source for nonlocal raw materials and a few highly specialized artifact types, but a closer examination of trait distributions and contexts of most classes of "exotic" items is advised. The common assumption that certain finely made vessels necessarily resulted from trade is especially open to question. This paper considers the origin of negative painted Mississippian ceramics of the Illinois River Valley in the context of this broader problem. Evidence supporting local origin for negative painted ceramics in the Illinois River Valley is presented. Sampson, Kelvin, and Duane Esarey (Dickson Mounds Museum) EMBOSSED COWER ARTIFACTS FROM THE ILLINOIS RIVER VALLEY. Embossed or repousse' copper artifacts are among the rarest Mississippian cer emonial paraphernalia. Since the discovery of the Peor?a Falcon nearly a century ago, only a few embossed copper artifacts have been found in the Illinois River valley. These represent the most northerly group of embossed Mississippian copper items in the eastern United States. A review of these rare artifacts is presented including several poorly known and unpublished specimens. Mehrer, Mark W. (Iowa Office of State Archaeologist) A MODEL FOR MISSISSIPPIAN SETTLEMENT IN THE AMERICAN BOTTOM. Data from the American Bottom are synthesized in a settlement study of Mis sissippian building, household, and dispersed community organization. Changes in farmstead settlement paralleled regional trends during late prehistory. The roles of rural households changed as complex society waxed and waned. A model of the late prehis toric settlement system incorporates implications for the complex ways that social power is shared among hierarchically ordered settlements.</page><page sequence="5">94 Midwest Conference Abstracts [3] General Session: METHOD AND THEORY IN THE MIDWEST Murphy, Harry, Annette Ericksen-Latimer, and Marilyn Orr CONCERNS OVER TESTING STRATEGIES. The utilization of subsurface testing strategies for site identification and evalu ation is fraught with numerous difficulties. This paper will generally address some concerns over the identification of sterile subsoil, feature location and site definition. Neidig, Craig A., and Larry R. Abbott (University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign) POST-HOLING: A Novel Subsurface Testing Procedure and its Implications for Site Survey in Illinois. Archaeologists at the Resource Investigation Program at the University of Illinois have refined a novel subsurface testing methodology using modified post-hole diggers and bucket augers. Compared to traditional walkover survey and shovel-probe tests, site areas can be located and defined with improved accuracy. Furthermore, post-holing provides better systematic sampling control, more informative interpretation of buried components, and allows enhanced statistical treatment of the testing data. The cost benefits, with regard to evaluating contract mitigation procedures, are discussed. The research implications of the results of post-hole testing are considered, with an emphasis on upland site contexts in Illinois. Hickson, Robert, and Susana Katz (Center for American Archeology) A DISTRIBUTIONAL APPROACH TO THE ARCHEOLOGY OF THE INTERIOR UPLANDS, WEST-CENTRAL ILLINOIS. A project employing the distributional (aka "landscape" or "non-site") ap proach to archeology has been conducted along four one-mile-long segments of the FAP 408 right-of-way in Pike County, Illinois. Each segment was divided into 50 x 100 m parcels, and all artifacts were plotted. Topographic data were added to the artifact plots, and analysis of these data is currently underway. A geomorphic model of the uplands is also being developed. The Kampsville Archeological Center is conducting the project for IDOT Hassen, Harold (Illinois State Museum) FLOODPLAIN LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AND PREHISTORIC SETTLE MENT: An Example from the Meredosia Region, Lower Illinois River Valley. Documenting the geological history and human use of the lower Illinois River valley has been a primary focus of long term research. This paper examines temporal changes in prehistoric land use within a relatively small yet diverse segment of the landscape. The diversity of landforms in the study area provides an opportunity to examine how human use of the landscape changed in the context of a dynamic Holocene landscape. The results will be used to evaluate a geological model that discusses the potential for floodplain landforms to contain surface sites.</page><page sequence="6">MIDWEST CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS 95 Cantin, Mark (Indiana State University Anthropology Laboratory) A DIACHRONIC MODEL OF CHERT USAGE IN SOUTHWESTERN INDIANA. This paper examines the differential use of cherts through time in the Wabash Lowlands physiographic province of southwestern Indiana. The data base consists of some 1300 culturally-temporally sensitive projectile points collected from 20 "data centers" within the area. Results indicate a recurrent pattern in variability of the cultural-temporal selection of cherts, and suggest the observed variability is a reflection of an array of complex cultural systems. Miller, Terry (University of Missouri-Columbia) PREHISTORIC EXCHANGE AND LITHIC UTILIZATION IN EASTERN IOWA. Study of lithic exchange between eastern Iowa and surrounding Midwestern areas from a technological level, indicate different degrees of use of local and nonlocal materials from the pre-ceramic to the ceramic periods. Quality of lithic materials ap pears to have been more important during pre-ceramic times, resulting in greater movement of nonlocal materials. Social and possibly economic functions were the influencing factors controlling the movement of nonlocal lithic materials during the ceramic period. Jelks, Edward B. (Illinois State University) THOUGHTS ON WAVE DIFFUSION. Archeological literature documents that during some 13,000 years of North American prehistory there were several times when most or all of the human societies occupying a large geographic area adopted a particular form or style of dart point or arrow point, even though the societies often possessed striking dissimilar cultures, and the new point styles offered no apparent adaptive advantage over old styles that they often replaced. Several examples of this phenomenon, termed wave diffusion, are briefly examined. [4] General Session: PALEO-INDI AN AND ARCHAIC RECORD RESEARCH Tankersley, Kenneth B. (Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology) I WOULD RATHER BE HERE THAN OUT ON THE TUNDRA: Early Paleo-Indian Settlement Patterns of the Midwestern United States. Early Paleo-Indian settlement patterns are examined exclusive of late Paleo Indian and early Archaic sites. Viewed in this manner, early Paleo-Indian sites display less biophysical diversity than later sites. Early Paleo-Indian sites are restricted to settings that attract and concentrate game, or contain lithic raw material in adequate size, quality, and quantity.</page><page sequence="7">96 Midwest Conference Abstracts Tankersley, Kenneth B. (Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology) I WOULD RATHER BE HERE THAN OUT ON THE TUNDRA: Early Paleo-Indian Settlement Patterns of the Midwestern United States (Con't). Early Paleo-Indians likely entered the Midwest, circa 11,200 B.C., during the last expansion of boreal spruce forests and open vegetation. These settings provided optimal habitats for large herbivores and their predators. The protohistoric distribution of bison in the Midwest is offered as an analog to the hunting opportunities available during the late Pleistocene. Behm, Jeffery A. (University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh) NON-LOCAL LITHIC RAW MATERIAL PROCUREMENT AND TRANSPOR TATION IN THE LATE PALEO-INDIAN OF EAST CENTRAL WISCONSIN. Late Paleo-Indian (primarily Cody Complex) populations in the middle Fox River and lower Wolf River system of east central Wisconsin made extensive use of two nonlocal lithic materials, Hixton Silicified Sandstone and Marquette Rhyolite. Differ ential utilization of these two materials indicates patterns of procurement and movement that can best be explained by the use of watercraft for transportation. Ansiinger, C. Michael (Indiana State University) BLUEGRASS: A Middle-Late Archaic Site in Southwestern Indiana. Excavations at the Middle-Late Archaic Bluegrass site (12W162) were recently completed by the Indiana State University Anthropology Laboratory. The site is situated on a prominent rise along Bluegrass Creek, some 18 miles north of the Ohio River near Evans ville, Indiana. Excavations identified a well-developed midden, pit features, and human and dog interments. Artifactual materials include floral and faunal remains, engraved bone pins, and side-notched and stemmed points. Available C-14 dates range from 6200 to 5000 B.P. Stafford, C. Russell (Indiana State University) and Barbara D. Stafford (Center for American Archeology) MIDDLE ARCHAIC LOGISTICAL STRATEGIES IN WEST-CENTRAL ILLINOIS. Brown and Vierra have proposed a model of Middle Archaic settlement strategies in west-central Illinois, based on the long stratigraphie record represented at the K?ster site. Recent investigations of a series of Middle Archaic occupations located in other geomorphic zones provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model. Different types of sites are present in each geomorphic zone, which appear to represent camps, a part of a logistical settlement strategy. Morrow, Toby A. (Center for American Archeology) EARLY ARCHAIC TASKS AND TECHNOLOGY AT THE TWIN DITCH SITE, GREENE COUNTY, ILLINOIS. Twin Ditch is a stratified Early and Middle Archaic habitation site on the Illinois River floodplain. Continued excavation in 1988 has revealed a series of hearths sur rounded by tool clusters and debris concentrations in the Thebes Cluster component. Three postmolds and a tool cache were also discovered. Refitted tools and debris offer insights into the organization of tasks conducted at this early base camp.</page><page sequence="8">MIDWEST CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS 97 Bower, John (Iowa State University) and Michal Kobusiewicz (Polish Academy of Sciences) COMPARATIVE STUDY OF POST-PLEISTOCENE CULTURAL ADAPTA TIONS IN NORTHERN EUROPE AND THE NORTH-CENTRAL UNITED STATES?A PROGRESS REPORT.

[5] General Session: RESEARCH INTO MIDWESTERN PROTOHISTORY Munson, Cheryl Ann (Glenn Black Laboratory of Archaeology), David Pollack (Kentucky Heritage Council), and Mary Lucas Powell (University of Kentucky? Lexington) THE SLACK FARM SITE (15Un28): Shovels, Badges, Tobacco, and Notebooks. Recent looting of the Slack Farm site (15Un28) a Carbon-Welborn phase (A.D. 1450-1650) village in Union County, Kentucky, resulted in the disturbance of hundreds of prehistoric/protohistoric burials. The arrest of ten individuals who are alleged to have looted this site attracted the attention of archaeologists, the general public, the Kentucky General Assembly, and Native American activists. To assist the State Medical Exam iner's investigation of the disturbed area, archaeological investigations were carried out at the site. This paper summarizes the legal and legislative actions that resulted from the arrest of the alleged looters, the relationship between the archaeologists and concerned Native Americans, and the preliminary results of the archaeological fieldwork and analysis of the recovered skeletal remains. O'Brien, Patricia J. (Kansas State University) THE DIRECT HISTORICAL APPROACH IN EASTERN UNITED STATES ARCHAEOLOGY. In the 1930s W. Duncan Strong, W. R. Wedel and J. H. Steward outlined the assumptions of the Direct Historic Approach. Using data from old maps, ethnography, ethnohistory, mythology and linguistics historic tribes were linked to historically known sites. Their artifact assemblages were then used to link historic artifact traditions and peoples to prehistoric ones. Most recently the DHA has logical connections to ethnoar chaeology, use-wear studies and problems of analogy, including the 'Pompeii Premise.' Philosophically it is embedded in the deductive-nomological system. Hirst, K. Kris (Iowa Highway Archaeology Program) LATE PREHISTORIC FRESHWATER MUSSEL SHELL USE. Shell tools reflect subsistence strategies and at the same time manifest symbols of social and cultural identity. Recent investigations of freshwater mussel shell tools from Nebraska phase archaeological sites show that more shell was used as tools and ornaments prehistorically than might be inferred from midwestern ethnohistoric sources. Ethnohistoric comparisons beyond the midwest can be useful.</page><page sequence="9">98 Midwest Conference Abstracts Richner, Jeffrey J. (Midwest Archeological Center) ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT AN HISTORIC ABORIGINAL FISHING CAMP ON LAKE SUPERIOR. The P-Flat site (47AS47) is located on the southern tip of Manitou Island, within Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Wisconsin. A large assemblage of faunal remains, dominated by lake trout and whitefish, was recovered from a small midden at the site. Thermoluminescence and Carbon 14 dating place the age of the site within A.D. 1640-ca 1800. Analysis of recovered materials revealed that the site represents a late fall expression of the Inland Shore Fishery. Hart, John P. (Northwestern University) ONEOTA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION: A Cross-Cultural Pferspective. Path analysis is used to test neo-Malthusian and Boseruppian models of Oneota agricultural production with ethnographic data from 56 Native American groups. The analysis supports the Boseruppian model while the neo-Malthusian model is not sup ported. These results indicate that although climate does play a role in determining Oneota agricultural production, low population density is a more important determining factor. Collins, James M. (Iowa Office of State Archaeologist) THE PLACE OF THE DES MOINES RAPIDS IN LATE PRE-CONTACT ERA CULTURE HISTORY. Virtually forgotten since the taming of the Mississippi by the Corps of Engi neers, the Des Moines Rapids (a.k.a. Mississippi Rapids; a.k.a. the Iowa Rapids; a.k.a. Lower Rapids) once constituted a formidable geographic landmark along the "great river." The role of these rapids as crossroads, rendezvous, and boundary during the late pre-contact era is discussed. A rudimentary model of Oneota cultural cohesion is proposed. Sullivan, Lynne P. (New York State Museum), Phillip D. Neusius, and Sarah W. Neusius (Indiana University of PA). 1988 RETURN TO THE RIPLEY SITE: A New Look at Protohistory in the Lake Erie Basin/Allegheny Plateau Region of Southwestern New York. Brought to archaeological attention over 80 years ago, the Ripley site is the only major protohistoric settlement reported on the Lake Erie shore in southwestern New York. Investigations in the early 1900s and subsequent amateur activities focused on excavation of burials. Goals of the 1988 investigations were to recover subsistence information and assess the integrity of the site plan. Combined with regional survey, continued work at the site can greatly enhance knowledge of protohistoric subsistence and settlement systems in this poorly known region. Brose, David S.

Between 1620 and</page><page sequence="10">MIDWEST CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS 99 1650 the westernmost, Indian Hills complex, was absorbed or dispersed by the Ontario Iroquois as part of the Mascouten. To the east, the Sandusky complex populations, under pressure from the north, began moving into lower Michigan as elements of the Potta watomi. The easternmost Iroquoian groups may well have been forced to seek refuge in the Upper Potomac valley, initially by the expansion of their neighbors from the west, and ultimately by the aggression of their kinsmen from the east. The remnant of the Algonquian-speaking group in the Cleveland area was forced south into the upper Ohio River valley. [6] Symposium: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SHORT-TERM OCCUPATION MIDDLE WOODLAND SITES IN ILLINOIS Our knowledge of Middle Woodland cultural systems has typically been derived from archaeological investigations of mortuary groups and large village sites. While sites of these types are certainly the dominant components of Middle Woodland set tlement systems, the role of short-term occupation sites within these same systems is largely unknown. An improved understanding of the complexity of Middle Woodland settlement/subsistence systems is emerging through recent investigations at a number of the short-term occupation sites. Wagner, Gail E. (Center for American Archeology) ISOLATED MIDDLE WOODLAND OCCUPATION IN THE SNY BOTTOM. Havana ceramics have been recovered at two excavated sites in the Sny Bottom of the Mississippi Valley, approximately 20 miles south of Quincy. An isolated single cluster of five features was buried in overbank deposits on the natural levee along a slough at the Eagle site. So far a single cluster of four Havana features has been excavated at the nearby multi-component Rodgers Lake site. Preliminary analysis leads to speculation about Middle Woodland occupation in this area. Wolforth, Tom (Resource Investigation Program) THE WIDMAN SITE (ll-Ms-866): A Small Havana Settlement in the Wood River Valley, Illinois. The Widman site is a multi-component site located on the West Fork of the Wood River near Alton, Illinois, consisting of a small Middle Woodland settlement and four small Late Woodland settlements. This paper presents the material inventory settlement structure, and subsistence orientation of the Middle Woodland occupation, which was inhabited during Hopewellian times. This is followed by a short discussion of the Middle Woodland expression at the northern periphery of the American Bottom. Woods, William I. (Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville) MIDDLE WOODLAND SETTLEMENT IN THE UPLAND CAHOKIA CREEK DRAINAGE, MADISON COUNTY, ILLINOIS. During 1982, an investigation consisting of random sample archaeological sur vey, environmental depiction, and catchment analysis was conducted in the upland Cahokia Creek drainage of Madison County, Illinois. Five Middle Woodland sites were identified within the surveyed area. Taken as a whole these sites exhibited the highest</page><page sequence="11">100 Midwest Conference Abstracts habitat diversity when compared to later occupations. However, when viewed individ ually much less variation was evident. It is proposed that all except one of these sites functioned as temporary, specialized extractive camps and were related to one or more base settlements situated proximal to the point where Cahokia Creek exits from the bluffs. Yingst, James R. (Dayton Museum of Natural History) THE POINT SHOAL SITE (ll-My-97): A Short-Term Havana Occupation Along Shoal Creek, Montgomery County, Illinois. The Point Shoal site (1 l-My-97), located on a terrace overlooking Shoal Creek, was investigated in conjunction with an IDOT bridge replacement project. The artifact assemblage, obtained from controlled surface collections and five Havana pit features, indicates that this site functioned as a specialized camp; the internal site structure suggests a single Havana occupation of short duration. Preliminary inferences regarding the nature of Middle Woodland occupation in this portion of the Shoal Creek drainage are drawn from local collector data. Fischel, Richard, and Susana Katz (Kampsville Archeological Center) COLDFOOT: Havana in the Uplands of West-Century Illinois. Coldfoot is a small, single component, limited activity area in Pike County, Illinois. Buried beneath almost 1 m of alluvium, it represents a previously unsuspected locus of activity within the Havana phase settlement pattern. Funded by the Illinois Department of Transportation, a block was excavated within the right-of-way of FAP 408. No features were positively identified, but the quantity and distribution of artifacts suggest a single episode of hunting/gathering activity.

Clark, Caven P. (National Park Service, Isle Royale National Park) ISLE ROYALE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY: 1988 The archeological survey of Isle Royale National Park is in its third year. In the 1988 survey season 18 prehistoric sites were discovered, providing examples of Laurel, terminal Woodland, and 18th century aboriginal components. Eleven sites were test excavated. Research objectives of the Isle Royale archeological survey include the elucidation of copper working technology, the articulation of copper mining and fabri cation with subsistence and settlement variables, culture contact among late prehistoric groups on Isle Royale, and the question of access to Isle Royale's copper resources relative to the north and south shores of Lake Superior. A summary of recent findings and future directions is presented. Martin, Terranee J. (Illinois State Museum) A PROGRESS REPORT ON ARCHAEOLOGICAL ANIMAL REMAINS RECOVERED FROM ISLE ROYALE NATIONAL PARK DURING 1987. Animal remains associated with Terminal Woodland occupations were recovered during 1987 from several sites located on the eastern one-third of Isle Royale in western Lake Superior. In addition to a dog burial discovered at the Lone Tree Cove site, faunal remains suggest variability in animal exploitation among prehistoric sites on the island. These data promise to contribute toward the development of subsistence and settlement pattern models as the archaeological investigation of Isle Royale National Park progresses. Green, William (Iowa Office of the State Archaeologist) THE TURKEY RIVER MOUND GROUP: A Red Ocher/Early Woodland Mor tuary Complex. In 1964 Marshall McKusick excavated part of the Turkey River Mound Group, situated on the Mississippi River bluffs in northeastern Iowa. At that year's Midwest Archaeological Conference in Urbana, McKusick reported the mounds were of Hope well affiliation. Since then, the excavated mounds have been recognized as Early Woodland, but no detailed report was prepared until 1987-1988. In this paper, the features and recovered materials are reviewed and a newly-discovered Marion culture mortuary camp?probably associated with the mounds?is reported. Sampson, Kelvin W. (Dickson Mounds Museum) CONVENTIONALIZED FIGURES ON LATE WOODLAND CERAMICS. Two Late Woodland Maples Mills phase (A.D.700-1000) vessel fragments bear ing cord impressed zoomorphic designs were recently found at the Liverpool Lake site in the central Illinois River Valley. Five previously unrecognized zcK)morphic decora</page><page sequence="13">102 Midwest Conference Abstracts tions were discovered in a review of records and Maples Mills phase ceramic collections from nearby sites. Prior to these discoveries, only three similar decorations had been reported. The decoration of these vessels is described, illustrated, and interpreted. Interpretation of the symbolism expressed by these decorations provides a rare insight into Late Woodland belief systems. Parallels are drawn between the symbolism ex pressed by these motifs and various other motifs used throughout North American prehistory. Conrad, Lawrence A. (Western Illinois University) THE LIVERPOOL LAKE SITE: A Substantial Maples Mills Habitation Site in the Central Illinois River Valley. Surface collecting by Western Illinois University (WIU) and Dickson Mounds Museum and excavations by WIU have shown the Liverpool Lake site to be the first recognized substantial Maples Mills site in the Illinois River Valley. The surface col lections and ongoing excavations of more than 30 pit features have provided the best non-mortuary assemblage of the phase available and place this Late Woodland mani festation in a new light. Excellent faunal and floral preservation should provide valuable insight into the economy of these people. [8] Symposium: RESULTS OF UIUC ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGA TIONS ALONG THE 5.8 MILE EXTENSION OF FAI-270(255) IN THE AMERICAN BOTTOM, ILLINOIS. Major archaeological investigations were conducted by the UIUC in 1984?85 along an extended portion of FAI-270(255), several miles north of the Cahokia site. The results of both excavation and three years of analysis are presented. Seventeen sites were excavated including a Hopewell hamlet, an extensive Early and Middle Archaic base locale, a Mississippian busk ceremonial complex, and several sites producing unique ceramic assemblages dating to the early Emergent Mississippian period. A summary of the late Archaic period, results of archaeobotanical analysis, including the earliest maize yet recorded in the American Bottom and, a discussion of differential lithic resource utilization within the Bottom through time will also be presented. Higgins, Michael J. (University of Illinois) THE EARLY AND MIDDLE ARCHAIC OCCUPATIONS OF THE NOCHTA SITE (ll-Ms-128). The Nochta site is located within the American Bottom on a long, sandy ridge between two relict meanders of the Mississippi River. Archaeological investigations were undertaken at this site in 1985 to mitigate the effects of construction and associated borrowing activities for Interstate 255. The borrow pit excavations revealed the presence of substantial quantities of unstratified Early and Middle Archaic cultural remains buried between 60 and 120 cm below the surface. Diagnostic projectile points recovered from the site include Dalton, Agate Basin, Hardi Barbed, and Kirk Comer Notched. The presence of adzes, various point manufacture and reworking stages, flake tools, and hearths in the Dalton component is interpreted as representing a residential base camp. The Middle Archaic component, radiocarbon dated between 6490 and 6180 B.P.,</page><page sequence="14">MIDWEST CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS 103 is represented by over 200 features in the northwest portion of the site and appears to reflect a logistical field camp that was reoccupied several times. The Nochta phase has been tentatively designated to identify this time period in the American Bottom. McElrath, Dale (University of Illinois) THE LATE ARCHAIC IN THE AMERICAN BOTTOM IN LIGHT OF NEW DATA. The Late Archaic in the American Bottom has been defined based primarily on data derived from 1-270 investigations. The resultant four phase sequence (i.e. Falling Springs, Titterington, Labras Lake and Prairie Lake) have been verified through sub sequent research with only minor adjustments in relative dating. This paper will focus on the re-evaluation of the sequence in light of the data that has emerged since the original phase designation, and will suggest future avenues on inquiry that are necessary for completing the Late Archaic picture for the American Bottom. Maher, Thomas O. (University of North Carolina) THE HOLDING SITE: A Hopewell Horticultural Village in the American Bottom. The Holding site represents the first substantial Hopewell residential site exca vated in the American Bottom. Seven structures, 143 pits, 13 stains of undetermined function, and 74 nonstructural postmolds were identified. Ceramics and lithics were recovered indicating interaction with Middle Woodland groups in the lower Illinois River valley, southern Illinois, and possibly the lower Mississippi River valley. Artifacts created from non-local material (obsidian, mica, and copper) were also retrieved. Seeds of domesticated maygrass, goosefoot, erect knotweed, and little barley were recovered from feature context. The position of the Holding site in a larger Hopewell settlement of the American Bottom is also discussed. Jackson, Douglas K. (University of Illinois) INVESTIGATIONS AT THE KELLER-SAMSON BORROW PIT: Early Emergent Mississippian Occupations in Madison County, Illinois. In 1984 and 1985 the University of Illinois FAI-270 Project conducted archae ological investigations at three sites to be impacted by borrow activities within the Keller-Samson borrow pit, located on the bluff edge north of Collinsville in Madison County, Illinois. The Samson (ll-Ms-119), Samson Bluff (ll-Ms-1186), and East ridge (11-Ms-l 187) sites were subjected to large scale removal of plowzone by heavy equipment revealing numerous subsurface features. Two early Emergent Mississippian hamlets are represented among these features and they comprise the most significant component excavated, providing new data on Emergent Mississippian groups in this northern portion of the American Bottom. A Collinsville phase (A.D. 800-A.D. 850), encompassing the first half of the previously defined Loyd phase, is proposed based on data from these sites. Additional features at these sites are representative of small Archaic, Late Woodland, and Mississippian occupations.</page><page sequence="15">104 Midwest Conference Abstracts Fortier, Andrew C. (University of Illinois) A MISSISSIPPIAN "BUSK" CEREMONIAL COMPLEX AT THE SPONEMANN SITE. A unique Stirling phase, Mississippian ceremonial complex was uncovered by the UIUC in 1984-85 at the Sponemann site (ll-Ms-517), located several miles northeast of the Cahokia site. Included in this complex were a small "household temple" con taining the remains of at least three figurines, a small courtyard, a large isolated pit with unusually large quantities of ceramics and maize, a sweat lodge, a red cedar structure (red cabin?), and evidence for specialized plant use. This complex of features and artifacts is interpreted as one of the earliest evidences of busk ceremonialism in the Eastern Woodlands. Parker, Kathryn E. (University of Illinois) THE SACRED AND THE MUNDANE: Prehistoric Man-Plant Relationships in the Edelhardt Lake Locality. Our perceptions of man-plant dynamics in the American Bottom area have been altered, or at least broadened by new botanical data recovered from recently excavated Middle Woodland through Oneota sites in the Edelhardt Lake locality. The Holding site appears to have functioned as a Hopewellian farming community focused on the cul tivation of cereal crops. Farming was also the primary economic activity during the Terminal Lake Woodland occupation at the nearby Sponemann site, with maize added to the crop complex by A.D. 750, earlier than previously thought by archaeologists. Use of plant materials in Stirling phase Mississippian sacred or ritual contexts was indicated in the "religious precinct" at Sponemann. The final prehistoric occupation at Spone mann, the Oneota, suggests a return to man-plant dynamics of a much earlier time period. Williams, Joyce A. (Illinois Historic Preservation Agency) DIFFERENTIAL UTILIZATION OF LITHIC RAW MATERIALS AT TWO SITES IN THE AMERICAN BOTTOM. The differential use of lithic raw materials by four cultural components (Middle Woodland, Emergent Mississippian, Mississippian and Oneota) is discussed in three contexts: geological considerations; subsistence activities; and socio-cultural manifes tations. The Middle Woodland component is present at the Holding site and the re mainder components are present at the Sponemann site. The sites occupy the same geographical locality in the American Bottom. Lithic raw materials including lime stone, sandstone, mudstone, glacial till, and chert are equally available to all of the occupations. [9] General Session: CONTRIBUTED PAPERS Lowe, David C.

Murphy, Harry (Ohio Department of Transportation) LUCAS AND OTTAWA ROUTE 2 SURVEY AND PREDICTIVE MODEL. The observation that the environmental character of the Ohio Black Swamp region lends itself to development of a settlement pattern model was suggested by Prahl, Brose and Stothers in 1973. Following this lead a model that indicates the areas of high and low potential for the presence of prehistoric sites was developed as part of the Ohio Department of Transportation?Bureau of Environmental Services cultural resources assessment for the proposed improvement of State Route 2 through the northwestern edge of the Black Swamp region. In its most simplistic form the model predicts that evidence for prehistoric utilization will be found on the islands and peninsulas of dry ground within what were prehistorically predominantly wet and/or water-covered areas of wet prairies, swamp and marsh.

A survey of part of the drought-lowered Illinois River was completed by Dickson Mounds Museum and the Illinois Valley Archaeological Society during the summer of 1988. Supported by a strong volunteer force, this project was able to log nearly 1000 person hours on the river and survey most of the 158 km shoreline from Naples to Peor?a. Little has been known previously of the prehistoric habitation patterns on the natural levees of the central portion of the Illinois River Valley. One hundred twenty eight new sites ranging from 600 B.C. through the Historic period were recorded. Early Woodland (Marion and Liverpool phases) and terminal Late Woodland (Bauer Branch and Maples Mills phases) occupations were numerous and sometimes intensive, whereas Havana/Hope well and Weaver period habitations were rare. Radical shifts in utilization of this specific location presumably illustrate settlement pattern responses to specific adaptive changes during the Woodland period. Carr, Christopher (Arizona State University) THE COMPLEMENTARY ROLES OF RADIOGRAPHY AND PETROGRA PHY IN CERAMIC TEMPER ANALYSIS. Analysis of the temper in ceramic vessels is useful in studies of vessel function, chronometry, and exchange. Relevant variables include the fractional volume of all temper particles or particles of certain mineralogical or size classes, particle size dis tribution, and material/mineralogy. Improved radiographie techniques allow each of these to be estimated reliably with large samples, save mineralogy, which can be identified only approximately by particle grey-level and morphology. Petrography pro vides more detailed mineralogical information but may not allow reliable estimates of any of the variables for lack of adequate sample volumes. These issues are exemplified for Ohio Woodland sherds and a solution is offered. Foradas, James G. (The Ohio State University) TOWARD INTRAFORMATIONAL SOURCING OF FLINT USING NORMA TIVE MINERAL COMPOSITIONS: A Preliminary Study Using Flint Ridge Flint. A new method of sourcing flint based on normative mineral compositions was tested on eight flint samples from two different prehistoric quarries at Flint Ridge, Ohio. Interformational distinctions were based on detrital mineral composition of samples. Intraformational distinctions were based on secondary mineral composition of samples. The new method is applicable to all flint and chert, cost effective, not affected by heat treatment, and can be nondestructive to artifacts.

Lune, Rochelle (Northwestern University) USE OF WETLAND RESOURCES IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS: Results of Phase 1 Archaeological Investigations of the Cedar Shores Development Property, Lake County, Illinois. An archaeological survey of 700 acres north of Deep Lake and east of Cedar Lake confirms previous studies in southeastern Wisconsin and northeastern Illinois which have documented the rich resource potential of wetlands for prehistoric people. Thirty three prehistoric sites, and 70 isolated finds dating from the Early Archaic through the Mississippian periods were discovered along marsh and lake edges on the Cedar Shores property. Unlike other surveys conducted in the region, the majority of the sites appear to be late Archaic/Early Woodland. Doershuk, John F. (Northwestern University) WILL COUNTY 2: The Data Continues . . . Known Sites, Topographic Zone Analysis and Some Future Observations. Data from 281 previously recorded archaeological components in Will County, Illinois are used to model site location characteristics on a county-wide basis. This information is compared with results of a topographic zone analysis for the county. These zones are resource areas which would have variably influenced prehistoric sub sistence and site location. Linking known site characteristics with topographic zones generates expectations for site locations in currently untested areas of the county and the Lake Michigan area in general. Craig, Joseph (Northern Illinois University) PREDICTIVE MODELING OF PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE CHICAGO LAKE PLAIN. A predictive model of prehistoric settlement patterns for the Chicago Lake Plain is developed from Lake Calumet and Calumet City quadrangle site data. The model depicts two areas of settlement: 1) river bottomlands and 2) sandridge terraces. Further analysis of Lake Plain settlement strategies shows that Archaic sites are located on sandridge terraces, Woodland sites occur equally in bottomlands and on sandridges, and Mississippian sites are located almost exclusively in bottomlands.

(Northern Illinois University) THE LATE PREHISTORY OF THE CHICAGO AREA: Temper and Tradition Again. An understanding of the late prehistory of the Chicago Area and northern Illinois is hindered by problems of dating and chronology. Lacking stratigraphie and radiocar bon data alternate interpretations are possible: 1) two Upper Mississippian groups producing distinct pottery coexisted in complementary but overlapping ecological niches for an extended period of time; 2) as the remote reaches of secondary streams were abandoned, Langford ceramics?a grit-tempered pottery and the only Mississip pian pottery found in those areas?ceased to be produced. The second interpretation, although not without problems, is favored. Bird, M. Catherine (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) LANGFORD TRADITION CERAMIC: A View from the Homeland. A frontier homeland paradigm is used to develop a model for the Upper Missis sippian Langford-Oneota ceramic assemblage relationship. Few comparative or tech nological studies of Langford ceramics exist, although the cultural manifestations of Langford-Oneota traditions have been the topic of recent scholarly papers. The 96.1% Langford ceramic assemblage from the Washington Irving site, a single component Upper Mississippian village located in the Fox River valley of northeastern Illinois, is used to develop this model. Buckmaster, Maria (Northern Michigan University) THE PAQUETTE SITE: A Possible Stratified Late Paleo-Indian Site. The Paquette site, a Late Paleo-Indian site located in north-central portion of Michigan's upper peninsula, was investigated during the summer of 1987 by Northern Michigan University. The recovered assemblage is similar to that from Sheguiandah and other early sites located near the north shore of Lake Huron. An undisturbed area of the site located on a small terrace suggests the site is stratified. Data indicate that there was a change in the raw material selected for tool manufacture between the first and second occupation of the site.

Excavations at the Washington Irving site in 1984 and 1985 tested a small portion of this 4-ha Upper Mississippian village. A suite of five radiocarbon dates places the occupation from A.D. 1200 to 1450. The remains of several possible house floors and over two dozen archaeological features, along with large lithic and ceramic assem blages, were recovered. Ethnobotanical, faunal and technological analyses provide strong evidence for reconstructing the Upper Mississippian lifestyle. Herold, Elaine B. (Buffalo State College), and Patricia O'Brien (Kansas State University) THE HUBER AND HOXIE FARM SITES. The Huber and Hoxie Farm village sites were occupied in the late prehistoric or the early historic period. Both produced assemblages which are generally identified as Oneota or Upper Mississippian. Artifacts, such as engraved pebbles, shell gorgets, otter skulls, ceremonial stemmed pipes as well as burials, suggest that these sites had a ceremonial function. We suggest that such objects may indicate a late prehistoric or early protohistoric ritual which may be related to the later Midewiwin ceremony. In addition, a comparative analysis of the faunal material from Upper Mississippian sites indicates an increasing importance of fur-bearing mammals in the inventory, which may reflect an increasing participation in the fur trade in the protohistoric period.

The FAP-412 project area in central Illinois was part of the Euro-American frontier system from c. 1825 until the late 1860s. Through the use of diverse historical sources including federal population censuses, county atlases, and public domain land sales, a picture of the changing patterns of rural settlement emerges. Such a model, which uses ethnic and economic differences, and takes into account the importance of changes in transportation, can serve to focus specific research questions which can direct the archaeological investigation of rural sites. Stelle, Lenville (Parkland College) HISTORY, ARCHAEOLOGY, AND THE 1730 SIEGE OF THE FOXES. In the fall of 1987, historical speculation reemerged concerning the location on the Illinois prairies of the 1730 Mesquakie fort besieged by the French and their Indian confederates. During the summer of 1988, an archeological reconnaissance was made of Ml-6, one of the more likely loci. The results of this testing, while far from con clusive, point to the likelihood that this was indeed the site of this important conflict. McGregor, John R.

The site lies adjacent to the St. Clair River, just below the outlet of Lake Huron in Port Huron, Michigan. Its long-term strategic significance lay in con trolling access by navel and merchant shipping traffic into the upper Great Lakes. The United States built the first fort in 1814 during the War of 1812. It was abandoned in 1821, and seven years later, the US Army returned to construct a second Ft.

Though land between Elgin and Chicago is currently being developed at a hor rendous pace, several sites headed for ultimate destruction have been surveyed over the past several years. An excavation at one site has uncovered a preponderance of features dating to an Early Hopewellian occupation?2,150 to 1,950 B.P. Features with Netler, Hummel Stamped Plain, and Fettie Incised pottery found at the site were located in conjunction with Snyders, Midwest Complex, and Columbian Complex-style lithics. Careful mapping of 16 (3-m grids) at the site show a number of living patterns: among them is noted the remains of a 17-post summer lodge. Construction seems to have relied heavily on framing techniques. Angled posts may have been used for a temporary tent attachment. Distribution of lithics and pottery remains within the lodge suggests the living pattern noted by Densmore in Chippewa Customs. Pacheco, Paul J.
