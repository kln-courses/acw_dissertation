Spencer's epilogue does not fill this gap, and its failure to understand contemporary political trends only serves to underline the periph- eral artifice of the nationalist question in this vol- ume. Spencer's theoretical musings on nationalism are old hat. He fails to recognize a contradiction be- tween the instituted practices of the Sri Lanka state and the political and economic ground of its repro- duction on the one hand, and the ideological terms of state legitimation and expansion, founded in the primordialist rhetoric of Buddhist kingship, on the other. There is a cozy, comfortable ambience to his discussion of nationalist passion. Nationalism is de- scribed as a "genre" (p. 253) and is a manifestation of "people battling against the storm" (p. 252). The commonsense security of this analysis does nothing to penetrate the present horror and suffering of the people in Sri Lanka. It is said that the agony of Sri Lanka should be used to make a rather time-worn point against the village ethnography of yesteryear. This is not redressed in either the urbanity or acces- sibility of the style in which this book is written. African Reflections: Art from Northeastern Zaire. ENID SCHILDKROUT and CURTIS A. KEIM. Seattle and London: University of Wash- ington Press with the American Museum of Natural History, New York, 1990.272 pp., illus- trations, photographs, maps, notes, bibliog- raphy, index. SIMON OTTENBERG University of Washington This creative and complex work is the collabo- rative effort of an anthropologist (Schildkrout) at the American Museum of Natural History, who has never done research in Zaire but whose museum has on hand a major collection of northeastern Zai- rean objects, and of a historian (Keim) with exten- sive experience in northeastern Zaire. It is in a rel- atively new genre of anthropological, artistic, and historical analysis. Other recent examples include Adrienne L. Kaeppler's study of the objects gathered on Captain Cook's voyages (Artificial Curiosities, Bishop Museum Press, 1978), Jeanne Cannizzio's analysis of Canadian missionary collections, mainly from Angola (Into the Heart of Africa, Royal Ontario Museum, 1989), and John Mack's exami- nation of southern Zairean objects collected by an- thropologist Emile Torday for the British Museum (Emile Torday and the Art of the Congo 1900-1909, British Museum and the University of Washington Press, 1991). Such publications have certain com- mon features, enough to suggest that a new style of analyzing past cultures, a new way of looking, is evolving. Based on a specific collection or collec- tions and the collectors, each publication examines a museum exhibit of the objects, with emphasis on their aesthetic qualities as well as their functions. These publications employ not only the objects and published materials, but also the diaries, letters, field notes, drawings, printed plates, photographs, and other records of the collectors. In some cases the interpretations are broadened to include a dis- cussion of the anthropological theories and the gen- eral ideas concerning cultural evolution at the time and how these influenced the objects collected, what collectors thought about them, and what they did with them-in effect developing a useful mini- history of a slice of anthropology. Elements of the lives and cultural backgrounds of the collectors are explored and contrasted with that of the culture and lives of the people who used the objects. This is a complex new way of studying old cultures, inter- preting their culture and history through their cre- ated objects. The objects become a part of the his- tory, not a residue of it. The publications in this new genre are rich in photographs. They are not really art catalogues of exhibits but scholarly monographs accompanying the presentations. African Reflections shares these features: it is an excellent example of this genre, perhaps the best to appear so far. Based primarily on a collection at the American Museum of Natural History (supple- mented with information on objects from else- where), the artifacts came from an AMNH expedi- tion to northeastern Zaire in 1909-15 led by natu- ralist Herbert Lang and ornithologist James P. Chapin. While the primary purpose of the expedi- tion was zoological and botanical, these men col- lected a rich horde of ethnographic objects, often with detailed notations which provided the basis for this book. While focusing largely on the Mangbetu and the Azande, the book also discusses neighboring cul- tural groups and in fact, as is characteristic of this type of work, employs the objects and their collec- tors as a gateway into the ethnography and history of the cultures in the area at the time (approximately 1850 to 1920), so that what emerges is a picture of societies, interethnic relationships, political sys- tems, and European contacts, with accounts of the major explorations and expeditions into the area, the objects that were collected and the ways that the collectors interpreted them, so much so that the subtitle of the work, Art from Northeastern Zaire, is misleading; it really is a much broader study in which art and artifact play major roles. In this light there is a rich chapter on the ethnohistory of the area by Jan Vansina, a two-part chapter on music by Didier Demolin and Thomas Ross Miller, and a chapter on Azande art by John Mack. One considerable value of the work is that it ex- plores the way stereotypes concerning art scholar- ship arise and leave false impressions, in this case the idea that Mangbetu art is characterized by na- turalistic portrayal, particularly of the human head and figure. The authors convincingly argue that Mangbetu art in pre-European times was essentially nonnaturalistic, emphasizing design, and that it was the influence of European and Arab slave traders and, more important, of later missionaries and co- lonial officials that led to a florescence of natural- ism in Mangbetu art from about 1900 to 1915, after which this style largely died out. While Schildkrout and Keim are less convincing as to why it disap- peared than as to why it began, they clearly show that Mangbetu anthropomorphic art probably de- rived from neighboring cultures and was not of Mangbetu origin at all. The book is a warning to other scholars: European influence on traditional art and craft styles may occur much earlier than one 844 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="2">supposes, very rapidly after first contact. One should therefore be suspicious of a too-early crys- talization of the art concepts of a people. A related myth which the authors attack is the dominance of Mangbetu as a political and cultural center at the end of the last century, a myth largely perpetrated by the explorer Georg A. Schweinfurth (The Heart of Africa, [Harper and Brothers, 1874]). As Schild- krout and Kein state, "the myth consisted of exag- gerated descriptions of court life and of cannibal- ism, of high artistic achievement and abhorrent yet tantalizing (to Europeans) social practices" (pp. 29- 30). The work richly describes the complex historical and political relationships of the many ethnic groups in the area and the ways in which they em- ployed objects for ritual, status, and particularly pa- tronage purposes. Artists from one group worked in another's and sometimes in both groups' styles. Chiefs gave objects as presents to persons from var- ious groups. It is clear that when one gets beyond the older "one tribe-one style" mode of thinking, matters are complex and intertwined, and the au- thors do a nice job of teasing out the web of political and cultural relationships, the influence of the Azande upon the Mangbetu and the reverse, the contributions of the Bantu groups to the south to Mangbetu culture, and so on. The work is also val- uable in that very little has appeared in English on the Mangbetu, though, of course, there is much on the Azande, if not on their art. Because the book encompasses so much-art, history, culture, politics, collecting and collectors, anthropological history-I find that its very richness leads to a lack of focus. It appears to be about every- thing. This results in a certain disjointedness in places and some repetition of information, suggest- ing that this new genre of analysis is still working out its style. Almost too much is included. But no one interested in northeastern Zaire (and the cul- tures to the immediate north in the Central African Republic and the Sudan) at the turn of this century, and more especially in how to put art into history in the non-Western world, can afford to miss this book. Fusion of the Worlds: An Ethnography of Pos- session among the Songhay of Niger. PAUL STOLLER. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1989. xxii + 244 pp., photo- graphs, maps, notes, glossary, references, in- dex. BRUCE KAPFERER University College London Stoller writes graphically about diverse Songhay realities addressed in the actions of sorcerers and embodied in mediums. The book is dedicated to Adamu Jenitongo, a Songhay zima (possession priest) and powerful sorcerer, with whom Stoller began a long and intense association beginning in 1970 and ending with Jenitongo's death in 1988. Stoller's induction into the world commanded by Jenitongo and other priests and mediums enables him to present an insider's view, as in his earlier work, In Sorcery's Shadow (University of Chicago Press, 1987), co-authored with Cheryl Olkes. But for this reviewer, the inside view is made more powerful by Stoller's occasional distanced perspec- tive whereby visions of experience are placed in the context of the ethnographer's knowledge of general historical and political processes affecting the re- gion of Tillaberi, the main town of Stoller's re- search. Stoller is less given to the self-appropriation of others' experience in this volume and avoids many of the pitfalls of recent experiments in eth- nographic writing. Songhay realities are not total- ized and homogenized in one ethnographer's ex- perience but reveal their dynamic diversity in the experiences and reflections of the numerous priests, mediums, sorcerers, and, indeed, spirits that Stoller encounters along his way. The ethnography opens at jenitongo's compound with an account of a possession ceremony in which the White Spirit, Serci, who resolves disputes and domestic problems, is brought into the body of a woman medium. The descriptive technique creates a sense of moment and spirit presence. It is a style repeated throughout the volume, one major effect of which is to deny the distance between the spirit worlds of the Songhay and their hosts. There is no real/imaginary dichotomy where the "objective/ra- tional" reality of an alien ethnographer is made to dominate and negate the "subjective/experiential" realities of the observed. Stoller brilliantly recreates the reality of spirit presence; hosts are what they mediate, and spirits become flesh and blood in their "fusion" with human existence. Stoller similarly dissolves conventional analytic distinctions such as those between "myth" and "history." For example, his account of Songhay history which their spirit world refracts moves almost imperceptibly from the distanced overview of the ethnographer to that of the immediate and lived historical understanding of Songhay where distinctions between real or unreal figures in history have no meaning. The point should be well taken. Stoller never denies the im- portance of an objectivist overview and employs such a perspective to account for some aspects of the many-layered complexity of Songhay spirit real- ities and their attitude toward these spirits. But Son- ghay history is also, and perhaps most important in the context of this book, a Songhay construction. The spirits are Songhay objectifications of the his- tory of their social and political situation as Son- ghay confront and experience it. Moreover, the spirits are not mere representations of historical ex- perience-of a "past" in objectivist terms-but vi- tal embodiments of a history that is enduringly pres- ent, the powers of history with which the Songhay continually struggle in a tireless effort to overcome the fragility and uncertainty of their world. The Songhay described by Stoller are at a vortex of historically shifting ethnic political forces, and these, together with the experience of French co- lonialism, the impact of postcolonial Western dom- inance, the expansion of state bureaucracy, devel- opment, and so on, generate a weave of mutually subversive and frequently conflicting social orders and relations. Older Songhay hierarchies are upset in the formation of state bureaucracies and an egal- itarian ethos (former slaves become civil servants). A conservative Islam is set in opposition to spirit be- liefs and possession practices which Songay grasp reviews 845</page></plain_text>
