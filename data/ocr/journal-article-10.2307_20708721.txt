<plain_text><page sequence="1">[ The Personalist Forum. Volume 12, number 1. Spring 1996. 18-34. ] Conti's Reclamation of Farrer's Cosmological Personalism: A Pragmatistas Response_ Roger A. Badham "The God of Professor Hartshorne," Farrer wrote on first encountering his work, "must be human enough to have a natural need of His creatures. It is apparently a matter of no consequence that He should be divine enough to save their souls alive" (Faith and Speculation, 170). This bon mot of Farrer's stands at the heart of his theology. It is char acteristic of the classical Incarnational dialectic he attempts to retain in his mature work. That being the case, one may wrongly infer from the saying that Farrer had no use for the Chicago professor's process philosophy and its rejection of supernaturalism. For it fails to display the genuine and real debt Farrer felt towards Hartshorne. Farrer wrote to John Glasse that "I can see that I have never properly considered how much rethinking the Christian Aristotelian deity requires in view of the fact that we cannot hold Aristotle's logico-metaphysics." The year was 1965. Three months later, Farrer again wrote to his friend, and commended Hartshorne. "He has shown that the Aristotelian hyperbole about divine autarcheia [self-suffi cency] is irreconcilable with Christian theism, and ought to be systemati cally purged out of theology. There is no denying that the Creator actively relates Himself to the objects of His activity and commits Himself to them by His love" {Metaphysical Personalism, 150). This movement in Farrer's thought from Aristotelian-Thomist-Cartesian categories towards a more "pragmatic theology" lies at the heart of Charles Conti's lucid and valuable work Metaphysical Personalism: An Analysis of Austin Farrer's Theistic Metaphysics (Oxford: Oxford University Press, Clarendon Press, 1995). Charles sets out to demonstrate the development within Farrer's thought through an analysis of Farrer's three major works: Finite and Infinite (1943), The Freedom of the Will (1958), and Faith and Speculation (1967). Charles brilliantly conjures the spirit of Farrer in these</page><page sequence="2">Conti's Reclamation of Farrer's Cosmologica! Personalism 19 pages and shows himself a helpful guide through the often dense reason ing, especially of the great early work Finite and Infinite. Indeed, it is here that Charles's work reveals its deepest insights into Farrer's texts. Finite and Infinite is Conti's exegetical starting point from where he inquires into the Oxford don's complex attempts to wrestle with philosophical and theo logical concepts of God. From there Charles is able to trace the trajectory of Farrer's thought succinctly and successfully, drawing us into the nuance and richness that has itself captivated Conti. Conti's reason for so displaying Farrer's work, while offering us an important analysis of a somewhat forgetten thinker, is far from antiquarian. As the title of the book suggests, Farrer represents a stream of thought largely eclipsed in many academic departments today. The kind of personalist thought and the kind of metaphysics in which Farrer engages offer a vital ingredient currently missing in present philosophical and theological discourse. I Finite and Infinite represents Farrer at his most Aristotelian. God is presented primarily in the static forms of Absolute Being or Actus Purus. Yet Conti contends that this already stands in tension with Farrer's other more agential concept of God. In Finite and Infinite, Farrer is already applying his esse est operari which he is later to develop into a central model of God as Causa Sui. In Finite and Infinite Farrer uses esse est operari to move away from Greek essentialist thinking, restating the doc trine of substance "in a credible form." Yet Charles perceives that Farrer's Absolute Being remained "incommensurate with these highly sought-after causal connexions" (37). Farrer used the concept esse est operari (being is activity) as early as 1933 to oppose the notion of divine immutability. Charles writes that Farrer's thought was "already headed towards agency-implications in and for theology" (xxxi). "God is not the same to me today as yesterday," Farrer argues (11). The austere immutable God was unsatisfactory to Farrer. However, he had not as yet found reason to challenge other Greek categories, such as omnipotence and omniscience. Charles points out that at the turn of the century the founder of pragmatism, Charles S. Peirce, had spoken of the contradiction between the divine austerity and Christian agapeism (139-40). Divine self-sufficiency conflicts with God's agency of covenantal and redemptive love. In Finite and Infinite these conflictual</page><page sequence="3">20 Roger A. Badham polarities remain without being successfully resolved, according to Conti. Nor is the relationship between finite being and the Infinite Being entirely successful, and Farrer's desire to build a bridge for philosophy once again to entertain metaphysics, stumbled on the failed logic of an Actus Purus which had no need to be known but nevertheless was to be discovered in relationship with finite being. Spinoza's Deus sive natura, the collapsing of God and natura naturans (nature naturing), was too much in direct conflict with the anthropomorphic model of God as love, as grace, for Farrer to long entertain, and eventually Spinoza's solution began to appear "flat and sinister" to him. For these reasons, Finite and Infinite "seemed unable to make up its mind," Conti tells us. "At times Farrer reasoned from 'being'-principles; at other times he reasoned from the 'anthropologi cal' base" (54). Writing a new introduction to the 1959 second edition of Finite and Infinite, Farrer wrote that in 1943 he had been "possessed by the Thomist vision, and could not think it false." He had originally attempted "to recon struct the doctrine of substance." He tells us that he was engaged in a search for that which can be genuinely apprehended of God within the self "initially, anyhow, in myself, self-disclosed as the subject of my acts." But by now Farrer was aware of the problem, "what right had I to claim that any such account was the account? . . . And if not. . . how could it bear the metaphysical weight I laid upon it? The fatal gap between language and reality yawns again" (Finite and Infinite, 2nd ed., ix-x; MP, 135). Conti considers the central problem in Finite and Infinite to be the equating of self-sufficiency with transcendence, leading Farrer to an austere theory of divine condescension rather than a full-blooded theology of incarnation; and it was the Incarnation that was to become the central tenet of Farrer's later theology which, despite the influence of process thought upon him, was always going to differentiate him from Hartshorne for whom the Christ-event had little purchase. II Prior to reading Hartshorne, Farrer had already begun to move away from static esse models of God. The movement emerges especially with his 1958 Gifford Lectures, The Freedom of the Will His adoption of the agential-will model for God was not fully developed, however, until his final work, Faith and Speculation (1967) which shows some of Bergson's influence. Farrer's movement has been variously characterized as one from</page><page sequence="4">Conti's Reclamation of Farrer's Cosmological Personalism 21 rationalism to fideism (so wondered Basil Mitchell), a journey from Athens to Jerusalem, from Absolute Being to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from Being to Becoming, and from stasis to dynamis. Faith and Speculation concerns itself with "a God about whom we have something to do," Farrer maintains (xxi). The concepts of will, agency, and person hood are indispensible to his later model of God. Farrer was always sufficiently the philosopher that, despite his move, he asserts that "the Jerusalem of faith must at least be on speaking terms with the Athens of reason." If Farrer is a theologian he still appears clothed in the purple toga. Thus we discover that his final work is well entitled Faith and Speculation. Charles considers Descartes, Aquinas, and Aristotle to be gently submerged beneath Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Incarnation is at the center; Absolute Being has exited into the wings. Farrer had come to understand the insufficiency of the static concept. "Absolute Being . . . falls off the chart of 'being' altogether," Charles suggests and Findlay's caricature of Anselm captures the trajectory well: "There is no abstraction greater than that which cannot be finally disassociated from any or all finite events" (169). Both Farrer and Hartshorne are engaged in types of natural theology. Both are aware of deep problems associated with Barthian "top-down" thinking. But while Barth's transcendent God is "Wholly Other" and Hart shorne's panentheist God, while immanent, is conceived as a wholly other nonanthropomorphic model of God, Farrer's model, rejecting transcenden tal impassibility and self-sufficiency, adopts a "cosmological personalism" as the most appropriate, and least distorting, construct. This being the case, Conti attempts three simultaneous tasks in this book (i). He seeks to show that Farrer builds "theology upon a sound anthropology, especially upon personalist premisses" (ii). He seeks to "pay a compliment to process theology, and especially Charles Hartshorne, for providing the stimulus which helped Farrer revise traditional theism" (iii). Conti wishes "to resist Wayne Proudfoot's reading of Farrer as a 'metaphysical solipsist'." These three tasks are linked and interwoven (for which reason I will not attempt to separate them). If Farrer's personalist presentation of God can be defended as a sound and helpful model, which has also been able to learn from and adopt some of the valuable insights of process thought, then not only is Farrer's model worthy of critical attention, offering us a third way between traditional supernaturalism and process relational naturalism, but</page><page sequence="5">22 Roger A. Badham Proudfoot's criticism of Farrer's model as over-individualistic might be shown to falter. Charles shows that process thought was a constructive lure to Farrer's own thought. Hartshorne provided him with categories which vastly aided his work. But Conti is also careful to show that Farrer's own theology already contained the seeds of relationality within it which then germinated quickly with Hartshorne's help. Following his exposure to process theology, Fairer steered an English via media between process categories and the nonrelational implications of Aristotelian-Thomist thought. The promise of this third way and its relationship to Whitehead's process thought is further developed in Charles's upcoming book, written as an ex tended discourse with theologians Edward Henderson and David Ray Griffin (entitled Reconceptualizing God). Ill Is the third way sufficient? On this question hangs the balance of Metaphysical Personalism. If Farrer's purging the leaven of Aristotelianism is a major theme of this book, Conti is forced finally to admit that the purge remains incomplete. This is perhaps characteristic of via media solutions. The direction of theology since the 1960s has continued the purge in far more extensive and radical ways than Farrer imagined. But it was not Farrer who set it in motion. It came far more from continental philosophy, literary theory, and American feminism. The attention paid to these movements has had the effect of eclipsing Farrer's influence upon more recent theology. Yet Charles still maintains that Farrer's incomplete ness does not detract "from the brilliance of his work" (208). We might argue the point. Despite Conti's excellent upgrades, Farrer's work appears dated to the reader suspicious of philosophical rationalism and Enlighten ment categories. Questions of contingency in God, of causality, of God as either being or agent, Actus Purus or Causa Sui, seem to lack urgency for current theological concerns in America. Whether they should lack urgency, and whether this is really the fault of Farrer's moderation or America's penchant for more idiosyncratic theologies, is a judgement that remains happily beyond the scope of this article. Farrer was attracted to the speculative metaphysics of process thought. He wrote to Henderson that it presented to him the kind of intellectual dis course absent from Oxford philosophy in his day ("Letters to Henderson," MP, 273). Farrer, like Whitehead, believed that metaphysics was philo</page><page sequence="6">Conti*s Reclamation of Farrer's Cosmologica! Personalism 23 sophically necessary. But he resisted a good deal of process thought. He rejected Whitehead's bifurcation between creativity and God, whereby God appears more a product of creativity than as creativity itself. Charles, again in his more recent book, writes that "for many, Whitehead's true Ood' is creativity. . . . The divinizing of nature ... put that [other] Deity out of theological business." Thus Farrer's agential God is to be preferred to Whitehead's creativity. Secondly, Fairer rightly unearths Whitehead's peculiar Leibnizianism. At the heart of Whitehead's relational thought is a most unrelational monadic notion. A battle seems to rage between Jamesian continuities and Leibnizian discontinuities in Whitehead. Can Leibniz acount for relations at all? "The divine mind," Farrer writes, "designed more through us, and less simply for us, than Leibniz allowed" (Reflective Faith, 109-13; MP, 164). But Leibniz is not quite as foreign to Farrer's own brand of interactive individualism as Conti might like in his debate with Proudfoot. Farrer admits that Leibniz is one of those "ancients" along with Aristotle, Thomas and Descartes, who got into "his bones long ago" ("Letters to Henderson," MP, 273). Farrer views space as a "Leibnizian Einsteinist"! and rejects the organicism of Whitehead's view of the cosmos. Charles paraphrases Farrer's thought: "The world is no single thing, so God cannot guide it as readily as our bodies harmonize with our mind." His view of free will also convinced Farrer that the analogy of the cosmos as God's body was pressed too hard by process organicism. The body obeys the mind's calling, Conti tells us, whereas "the autonomy of the world's constituents" convince Farrer that God cannot guide the world as readily as the mind guides the body (163). We may ask whether this is Whitehead's pressing an analogy too hard or Farrer's pressing it too literally? Farrer, for his part, appears unable to resolve the problem of soul-body dualism and its attendant questions of embodiment. While the process anima mundi may leave plenty to be desired, Farrer's personalist God remains a bodiless person, even though Farrer admits that the idea that "any [human] thought should detach itself from its instrument is not so much a wild improbabili ty as a logical monstrosity" (Faith and Speculation, 157; MP, 204). This brings us to wonder if Farrer does not press his own personalist analogy too hard. If human mind must be embodied to avoid a logical monstrosity, why is it preferable to think of God as a disembodied person, or "discarnate mind"? (203). Put differently: If God is disembodied, is the personalist model of the individual as valuable for imaging God as Farrer</page><page sequence="7">24 Roger A. Badham maintains? Farrer argues for it (contra Hume) by asserting the value of anthropomorphic projection in seeking to understand God. Hume's argument that God is "single, individual, and without parallel" denies us immediate comfort of the analogia entis (the analogy of being). Of this argument Farrer is aware. He is also aware of Feuerbach's and Freud's an thropological conclusions following Hume's logic. Our projection is legiti mate, Farrer nevertheless responds, even though we hover on the brink of a category mistake. Our desire to imagine God after our own image is based in our natural philosophical inclinations. We may hear the echo of Barth's stinging "No!" ringing out against Farrer at this point. We may wish to cover our ears. Farrer's attitude to the relationship between reason and revelation convinces him that "all our perceptions are projections of self-understanding" (22). If we are coined with the impress of God's image, then a theology of analogy is but its reverse side. A personalist model of God, Farrer argues, is less distorted, having emerged from our knowledge and of our interpretation of God's action in the world than transcendentalist models which are entirely foreign to either. Personalists, Charles states, recognize the appropriateness, and indeed, the necessity of using person-con cepts to construct an adequate conception of God.. . . They reason: it is better to be embarrassed about transcendental categories than about the anthropomor phic conception of self and God, since the latter may be in danger of distor tion, but at least we know it is not nonsense, (xxv) Well said. Farrer's personalist model of God as a being purposely resists Spinoza's, Tillich's or Whitehead's immanentalism. Conti writes: "The God of the world must be able to assert itself over it by a 'positive and practical' supernaturality; otherwise Supreme Being is merely identical with world process" (142). Once again, free will forms a part of Farrer's argument. Charles continues: "immanentism is in danger of (as Farrer put it) 'ousting' the finite activities from their appointed place in the universe as creative underlings with a mind and will all their own" (142). Rather than seeking to overthrow immanentalism, Conti suggests what Farrer sought was a "mediating third term"; "neither a God immediately 'at hand' nor one entirely 'in itself.' Supreme Being cannot be characterized by a love in and for itself. 'Solipsistic mania cannot be the image of God' [Farrer] wrote, as if to refute any charge of metaphysical solipsism." Charles believes that Farrer's compromise in Finite and Infinite "only</page><page sequence="8">Conti 's Reclamation of Farrer's Cosmological Personalism 25 allowed 'disinterested love' for the creature [and so] it turned the trans cendent majesty of God into something 'remote and glacial' after all" (143). This "hint of insularity, even standoffishness," Conti admits, was that "which process theologians evicted and which Wayne Proudfoot picked up and amplified in his reading of Finite and Infinite" (144). IV The third of the three major arguments that comprise Metaphysical Per sonalism is perhaps the least developed and remains at best inconclusive. For this reader at least, Charles is not successful in beating back Proud foot's charge that Farrer's theology represents a model of God based upon individualistic solipsism. If Proudfoot picked up and amplified anything about God in Finite and Infinite, one is likely to conclude, contra Conti, that it is derived from more than a hint. If Charles himself can regret the remote and glacial qualities of Farrer's early work, and seek to shine light on Farrer's development away from it, he perhaps has to concede that Proudfoot's analysis may be based on more substantial evidence than a hint would suggest. Proudfoot, in his book God and the Self analyzes three competing types of theology, out of which, he argues, grow three competing models for God. These three are the monistic, the individual istic, and the social. Proudfoot names Tillich, Farrer, and Royce as repre sentative of the three positions respectively. Hence, while Tillich argues for God as Being-itself, a typically monistic view of God and humankind in an essential oneness, Farrer argues, not only in Finite and Infinite but throughout his career, for God as a Being, separate and distinct from our being. Farrer's attachment to the classical notion of substance, "understood primarily as will," Proudfoot argues, is at the root of Farrer's indi vidualistic thinking. Farrer's notion of God as essentially separate from world is closer to Barth than to Tillich. Contrary to the monistic type in which an essential unity between God and the world precedes any sense of distance, the problem for Barth and Farrer is primarily how is the inesti mable distance between God and the person to be overcome. It is for a reason that the Incarnation figures prominently in Barth and the later Farrer. In examining the controversy between Conti and Proudfoot in some detail, I will attempt to build upon Proudfoot's argument and advance my own in the direction of an alternate personalist model for God quite differ</page><page sequence="9">26 Roger A. Badham ent from Farrer's, and I believe, more relevant to current theological and philosophical concerns. For the later Farrer, Charles writes, it is the will which is " 'prime mover' in any attempt to know. It follows that any notion of God based on our self-understanding must also ' voluntarize' its ideal and by implication, curb Actus Purus transcendentalism, the idea of God as utterly Other" (130). In Faith and Speculation, Farrer is far less interested in the formalist language of degrees of being and far more interested in voluntarist implications. Proudfoot and Conti are in agreement on this point. In Charles's reading of Farrer, "agency is key to personal identity" (Recon ceptualizing God). This agency does not discount "the suppository of passions" as well as actions. But all the cultural-linguistic forces that shape and form us, that show us to be very circumscribed agents, are transparent ly absent from Conti's account. Contemporary cultural-linguistic awareness has argued convincingly that we are not as free to define ourselves as modernism has generally asserted. If that is so, then our use of agency as the key to understanding persons, and thereby describing God, may be based upon an analogical fiction. Further: If language about God is neces sarily metaphorical and analogical, we must ask, why do we expect a single linguistic model (of agency) to be adequate for understanding God? Farrer demands that we conceive of God as a personal agent, for other than that is to reduce God "to less than a real subject with whom we can be engaged." And if a personal agent, then certainly not an imperfect one, he would add. In Faith and Speculation, Farrer does not deal with the problematic raised by the continental drift of the French poststructuralists and other postmodern thinkers regarding the death or decentering of the subject. If the death of the human subject presents any small degree of problematic, how much more the language of God as subject? Whatever one may think of the relative merits of such a movement, to pass by in silence appears an oversight. It seems unfortunate that Farrer did not engage in the discourse regarding the now-ubiquitous "linguistic turn" which has had so deep an impact upon philosophical thought. By contrast, the success of Hartshorne's "divine receptiveness" as a concept central to process theology may be partly because it re-presents an idea abjected by medieval theories of divine impassibility and a one-sided agentialism, of a God beyond the confines of subject. The model of God as an individual person always privileges will. Yet it is not clear at all, even if one is committed to the idea of the imago Dei</page><page sequence="10">Conti's Reclamation of Farrer's Cosmologica! Personalism 27 as a means for analogical thinking about God, why God must be imagined after the model of a single person rather than, for example, a community in which each person plays a vital role in its smooth operation. The imago Dei is after all created "male and female" and after God's plural likeness, yet this is disregarded by Enlightenment-style individualism. If we explore the metaphors of imago Dei as of human community rather than of the indi vidual, and of God as community, what we discover is that the decisionist aspects of the will are immediately tempered by a variety of concepts of cooperative interaction (which will therefore also affect the way we think our ethics, as Proudfoot argues). How does a community function? Only the most hierarchical type of community expresses a clear sense of will of a few members through the rest; more commonly, a community is not so hierarchical, and the will far more inchoate even while growth, change, evolution are all discernible. Indeed, the doctrine of the blessed Trinity potentially, perhaps certainly, demands that Christian theologians pay atten tion to God as community, yet it is evident that the model of persons (three persons in one person) remains largely a failure to think beyond individualistic ways. V In God and the Self Proudfoot presents three models for imaging God: the monistic, the individualistic, and the social types. Tillich, Fairer, and Royce are respectively the three theologians chosen to represent the types. Conti criticizes Proudfoot's choice of Farrer for the individualistic type, arguing on behalf of Fairer as a theologian concerned for relationality. Proudfoot would himself agree that Farrer is far from being the most indi vidualistic thinker he could have chosen. The problem that opens up in Charles's book is that he fails to consider the startling contrast that Proudfoot displays between the individualistic and the social types. This is unfortunate, as Proudfoot's presentation of Josiah Royce offers a very real challenge to Farrer. Rather than beginning with the individual person and arguing towards sociality, as Farrer does, Royce inverts the direction. The results are by no means trivial. The sociality of persons demands that we understand the dynamics of community through which self-knowledge, knowledge of the world and of God is made possible. Language, as social, is already speech. We are not trapped in the isolation of thought which must be transformed into a magic bridge of speech in order to communi</page><page sequence="11">28 Roger A. Badham cate with others. Rather, we are already social beings, carried within the stream of language which is the currency of our community. For Royce, a community is both one and many. Proudfoot claims that neither Tillich's monism nor Farrer's individualism can account for many ness as a finished state. They both have the need to reduce to one. Royce, on the other hand, does not subsume the individual into community, but understands that the individual, and its will, still have to be accounted for. In Royce's thought, therefore, the individual has a place, not in the splendid isolation of the autonomous self, characteristic of Enlightenment presuppositions and strategies, but as a member of the community de scribed as a community of interpretation, a community that interprets itself and its world from its own standpoint. The individual's standpoint is one largely shared with, and in dialectical tension with, its community of inter pretation. Royce's thought is a contemporary interpretation of Paul's concept of the church as the body of Christ?a radical model when thus understood. It follows that Royce's primary model for the community of interpretation is the church as the beloved community. Royce's God is to be conceived as both community of interpretation and as the interpreter, Proudfoot claims. Royce suggests both angles as a solution to the problem of the one and the many, writing that "in [God] the Community, the Individual, and the Absolute would be completely expressed, reconciled, and distinguished" (The Problem of Christianity 2:219-20). Royce does not collapse community into a monism, nor the individual into community, but neither does he strand us with insular indi viduals nor an insular God. For Royce every personal self is a community, and communities are persons. "The self is not an atom," Proudfoot writes, "but is itself a unity in plurality" (195). This idea can be traced at least to St. Augustine's anthropology in De trinitate, where the community func tions within the individual are explored analogically to express the relation ship within the blessed Trinity. I would further wish to add to Proudfoot's arguments. While the prag matiste and Royce argue that no knowledge is immediate or naturally inborn, but is rather mediated through interpretation of signs, Farrer argues for "some residual sense of being a creature," Conti writes, which Farrer "found deep in the human psyche as the soul of religion. ... In this way the believer draws his or her interpretative charter from experience in general" (73). We begin to sense the very different worlds inhabited by the semiotic pragmatism of Proudfoot's Royce and the natural theology of</page><page sequence="12">Conti's Reclamation of Farrer's Cosmologica! Personalism 29 Conti's Farrer. We begin to understand why Proudfoot's Farrer appears strongly on the solipsistic side of the diagram, despite Farrer's real inter ests in relationality and interaction. The claim that Farrer's later thought develops into pragmatic theology seems pale by contrast with the more robust pragmatism found in the work of Peirce and Royce. We are less likely today to accept Farrer's natural theology claim that we have "a residual sense of being a creature." We are far more likely to agree with the pragmatiste that our thought processes are formed and shaped by our culture. If this is so, it is likely that Farrer's thought processes were formed and shaped far more by his Christian society than ever he imagined, and that his natural theology is not, in fact, "natural" at all in the terms of intuitive immediacy suggested by Charles. Rather, Farrer's Schleiermachian residual sense is mediated through his lifelong cultural and experiential Christianity. VI There is no doubt that Farrer finds sociality and relationality important. The reason for Farrer being taken by Proudfoot to represent the "individu alistic solipsistic type" is not to suggest that Farrer is any kind of theo logical misanthropist?we would all be wasting our time reading and writing about him were that the case?but rather it is to suggest that Farrer's personalism has not yet transcended enlightenment models of the person as individual agent. Therefore, Farrer's model of God does not break sufficiently free from conventional models of agency and the central notion of will based upon those individualistic paradigms. For example, Farrer still argues on behalf of dual agency, the idea that two wills, that of God as an individual agent and the person as an individual agent share a single act in the life of the person. While not wishing to entirely de emphasize the will (it is, after all, a most important human possession) I admit that this concept strikes me as rather conventional and supranatural istic. This is, of course, as much a judgement upon my own theological trajectory as it is upon Farrer's. One indirect but illuminating argument against such an individualistic personalism is offered by Lewis Thomas in his marvelous Lives of the Cell. He explores the idea of an anthill as a single inchoate organism whereby the "will" appears to be community-wide, rather than individualis tic. He also speaks of the interaction of human cell and mitochondria which form a kind of society of the body. Thus he breaks ranks with the</page><page sequence="13">30 Roger A. Badham hermetically sealed individualistic and atomistic view of organisms. This is significant new knowledge for theological anthropology. This way of thinking is far closer to Royce's type of sociality than it is Farrer's. It is a form of sociality that actually questions the primacy of the will, insofar as will is most obviously an individualistic term. (As an aside, we might point out that Foucault warns us that any com munity model could suffer from problems of coercive power; that commu nity is not an "innocent" model. Agreed?any master metaphor is always in danger of becoming an idol, which is why Sallie McFague argues for a plethora of metaphors for God and a move away from the reification of the metaphor. Along those lines, we might argue that process theology may help us break free from over-restrictive traditional models of God by offer ing a radical alternative. But in Beyond Supranaturalism, Conti, in return, wonders if process thought has itself fallen into the same trap, now de fending its own reified model of God as anima mundi [soul of the world].) Another problem exists: Farrer rejects the model that God is utterly other, based upon the assumption that if this were so, God would be unknowable. Yet, while some traditional models would seem to put God beyond possible knowability (e.g., those Aristotelian Absolute impassible categories which Farrer attempts to abandon), it is not certain that all models which speak of that which is utterly other would necessarily demand unknowability. Inorganic rocks and minerals are utterly other to us, and yet knowable?and many are prized far above human life. Life forms are less utterly other, but still other, and yet are often deeply known to us. Our pets daily attest to this loving knowability. By contrast, persons are not significantly other, in this sense, and yet some remain almost entirely unknowable to us?unfathomable. A second argument of this type is the assumption that one must choose between two models of God, that of utterly other or of person writ large, a form of polarization that appears to be unnecessary. There is a vast continuum of possibilities between these two polarities that are equally valid for consideration. Hence the scriptures can speak of the activity of God not only in terms of individualistic per sonalism, on one hand, but also in varying degrees of otherness?as whirlwinds, as pillars of cloud, as lion, as lamb. The will is not the central feature which displays itself in a consider ation of the created orders. It is, in fact, rare. Why then, does Farrer take that which is far from common in the created orders of the world as the model for God? The reason, of course, is that he is guided by traditional</page><page sequence="14">Conti's Reclamation of Farrer's Cosmological Personalism 31 interpretations of imago Dei. Farrer's philosophical metaphysics remains grounded in traditional Christian theological revelatory categories. So Farrer asks, in Faith and Speculation, "what sense can there be in postulating a transcendent Other that is anything but person? What empirical relevance can it have?" (Faith and Speculation, 48; MP, 207). This suggested, as his friend Basil Mitchell quipped, that there is a good deal more faith than speculation in Farrer's final work. But if based more on "faith," then I would argue it is faith insufficiently stretched by the multiplicity of models presented within its own seminal scriptures. "What sense can there be in postulating a transcendent Other that is anything but person?" I believe Josiah Royce had already offered a sufficient answer to that question fifty years before Farrer asked it. This Leibnizian question fails to take into account the vast intricacy of human relationship with the nonhuman orders of nature, which is occurring all the time. On this level, his purely anthropocentric model is ecologically unpromising for a twenty first century theology. The orders of nature with which we interact are all made by the same God; none of which has any claim to being the model for that which created it. On any given day, the weather (as one such order of nature) may affect us far more profoundly than any human agent. The movement from the helpful metaphor of God as person to an on tology of God as person (with the unchangeable name of "Father" lurking disquietingly in the backgound) emerges from Farrer's failure to move beyond anthropocentrism to a richer theology of creation. For Farrer, redemption, not creation, is the starting point for a meaningful doctrine of God. Creation, in Finite and Infinite, is God's action "in the inferior mode." Conti considers that Farrer "brought anthropology into the heart of theology and used the lessons of the heart to provide the evidence of faith, a God sensible au cour, sensible to the heart" (207). Farrer remains solidly, perhaps too solidly, within the classical tradition which has historically assumed that the rest of creation is God's resource for human use, that it is spiritless material in contrast to the nonmaterial angel and the human material-spirit synthesis. What this anthropological overdetermination fails to notice is the reality of a metahuman world. Zoology, biology, geology, astronomy, physics, quantum mechanics, and organic and inorganic chemistry remain invisible. The result is a reductive cosmology indeed. And Farrer, for that reason, appears to offer less than Charles claims for him. Perhaps this reduction must always be the case when we begin with anthropology and redemption rather than cosmology and creation. For that</page><page sequence="15">32 Roger A. Badham reason I consider Farrer's starting point too narrow for contemporary concerns. In Farrer's defence, we must remember that Hartshorne's reversed starting point guarantees that he will not arrive at any serious doctrine of redemption. So perhaps we must always hold the two in dialectical tension, rather than trying to reach from one as fundamental to the other as derivative. While Conti stresses the appropriateness of a personalist model for God, and agrees with Farrer that mind is inseparable from body, neither Farrer nor Conti seem to concern themselves with the problematic logic of personalism, which is that (1) if we are to speak of God as a person (with mind, will, intention) and (2) if we are to assert with Farrer that thought (therefore mind) apart from body is a logical monstrosity, then does it not lead us necessarily to a consideration of God's embodiment? Farrer appears to leave us with an aporia. A God based upon the model of a whole person, body and soul, while incidently (accidentally?) not possessing a body, leaves us rather disconcertingly with God as a ghost, or as the anima mundi of Whitehead's thought, or as the Deus absconditus (hidden God) of earlier philosophers. Henderson in Recontextualizing God describes Farrer's view of God approvingly as a "nonbodily individual," a concept that, while drawn from Farrer's thought, surely stands under the extension of Farrer's own condemnation as a "logical monstrosity." This is not to suggest that imaging God is an easy thing which Farrer ought to have done better. Far from it. We all seem to do rather badly at it, but as speculation goes, we are called upon to take in as full a cosmological understanding of our creator as possible. Perhaps we do so poorly for failing to perform that which makes God real to us. The ongoing allure of Farrer's work is that the performative element was always central to him for that very reason. He considered faith and speculation to be largely meaningless when divorced. Hence the difference between the philosopher's God, and the Christian's which Farrer, the philosophical theologian and Anglican priest sought to harmonize. Conclusions If this rather lengthy critique sounds like a dismissal of the value of Farrer's thought, let me now attempt to correct that impression. White head's model of God is of anima mundi. Hartshorne's is of the world as God's body. Farrer's is of the moral analogy of the individual person. If treated nonontologically, they all may have light to shed upon the problem</page><page sequence="16">Conti's Reclamation of Farrer's Cosmologica! Personalism 33 of imagining God. They all may prove semiotically translucent for some people while each remains inevitably inadequate. While models may properly compete to prove themselves the most adequate, a thoroughgoing theological pragmatism refuses the modernist tendency to equate a single model with the truth, thereby consigning all other models to the proverbial theological or philosophical dustbin. If we see our world(s) differently, then competing models are necessary, for what may offer depth of meaning for one person or one community may be opaque to another. The hegemony of the model is therefore resisted, alongside a simultaneous openness to the inadequacy of our own knowledge. If God is that reality that more than any other challenges the adequacy of the ways in which we understand the four dimensions of our cosmos, why should we expect a single model ever to be sufficient for all our needs? Bifurcating between competing models seems to be a refusal to play with linguistic possibilities to find how each may throw out new meaning?which is what language does best, after all! The premature rejection of models appears to deny possibilit?s of meaning. Jewish scriptural models for God were far more numerous, far more rich in metaphorical "thickness" than the few nurtured by the church. Christian theology does not have to continue in this direction. Am I attempting a disassembling of personalist notions for God? Royce's complex model of community sees the person as community and the community as person. Contemporary personalism must move beyond the limitations of individualism if it is to speak constructively to the social and spiritual situation. How, then, can personalists construct models that begin with community? Royce shows us the way. Finally, returning to Metaphysical Personalism: It offers an excellent description of Farrer's thought. Charles has championed that thought, bringing it into contemporary theological conversation. Farrer's voice may yet be heard as a moderating influence, offering a genuine path between Barth and Whitehead. And Conti is himself honest about many of Farrer's shortcomings. Charles writes: "That [Fairer] did not, perhaps, complete the purge of Aristotelian leaven from his doctrine of God as an 'Unconditioned Will' neither detracts from the brilliance of his work nor fails to indicate the direction in which we may profitably point him." I am very happy that as a result of some of the above criticisms Charles has been provoked to present a stronger reading of the sociality in Farrer than I was able to glean from his fine book. (See his rejoinder</page><page sequence="17">34 Roger A. Badham below.) This review, though not overly praising Farrer, is not intended to bury him. I take very seriously Charles's challenge and intentionally join in the conversation about those ways in which we can both be guided by, and guide, Farrer's thought for the future. Step one: Purging personalism of its individualistic tendencies and bringing it into a more dynamic con versation with post-Enlightenment anti-Cartesian thought.</page></plain_text>
