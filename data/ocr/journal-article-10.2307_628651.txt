<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETTAZZONI (R.). The All-Knowing God. Re- searches into early Religion and Culture. Authorised translation by H. J. ROSE. London: Methuen, 1956. Pp. xv + 475, with 51 illustrations. 6os. In this stimulating and provocative book, Professor Pettazzoni surveys an area which embraces recent primitive cults throughout a large portion of the globe, and the religions of most of the ancient civilisations known to us, in order to consider a single divine figure which he believes to be present in each of them-the all-seeing God who is therefore all-knowing. He seeks to show that throughout antiquity omniscience was an attribute of particular polytheistic gods (who like Helios were not necessarily supreme) in opposition to Father Schmidt's primeval monotheism, which he alleges to be an abstract, and therefore not a primitive conception; with attributes borrowed from theological speculation. For the primitive thinker, the author is convinced, the ideological complex: Omniscience of the Sky, or Justice of the Sun, is not the result of reasoning on transcendent deity but a concrete anthropomorphism often portrayed with a monstrous multiplicity of heads or eyes. Such omniscience is qualitative because of its visual nature, and its special object is the conduct of man. This analysis of the primitive mind in general is reinforced by a survey of anthropological research which sweeps over all the continents from Southern Central Africa to the extreme point of South America, and in the course of which the author discovers almost everywhere a male god of the weather, the sky or the sun, who watches men's deeds: 'the omniscient chief god of polytheism'. I think that he cannot be absolved from seeing these attributes too exclusively. He most justly observes in passing that the interpretatio Romana which gave Latin names to barbarian divinities, did not grasp the character of deity, which makes every god unique and absolutely original; but in discovering in each religion a being with an almost identical set of characteristics, he seems to lose sight of this maxim, and so produces a certain monotony. This is particularly noticeable in his treatment of the great prehellenic religions of Egypt and Mesopotamia. After surveying the survivals in many regions of Africa of a weather-god who is also a sky-god, he accepts the theory of a predynastic sky-cult in Egypt, which was to survive as Horus the sky-god whose eyes were the sun and moon, and Amun as air in motion, both to be assimilated with Re, and he derives this cult from the Hamites of East Africa. In Egypt, however, he encounters the sky as a goddess, and suggests that as the African giver of rain naturally lost importance in the Nile valley, 'so he gave place to a female sky' in Nut, 'identified with Hathor'. There are no speculations on the nature of such goddesses, who are unimportant to his thesis, except to bring forth the sun and Horus. This is partly due to his conception of those primary stages of worship postulated in the passage from a hunting to an agricultural economy. He passes over, except for a brief reference in the epilogue, that pastoral society which was of supreme importance to the basic religions of Egypt and Mesopotamia, whose cow-goddess was in both coun- tries the mother of gods and kings, and imagines the Mother-Goddess first in an agricultural environment, where earth is mated to the sky. The Young Gods of these and neighbouring states, the divinities of the crops in whose existence the great king- doms periodically renewed their life, are omitted from this survey, no doubt because they always remained gods of the dead; but the supreme gods who were also Father and Creator, would be more distinctly seen as the chief subject of the work if considered in relation with these. For instance, the author rightly emphasises the fact that Marduk, in the Babylonian Epic of Creation, replaces the storm-god Enlil of the earlier version. His weapon in the cosmic battle is indeed the whirlwind. But Marduk retains his personality as a young God. He is called four- eyed at his birth, not because he is all-seeing, but because he is endowed with a double portion of divinity. In no work of art is he double-headed, as Professor Pettazzoni conceives him, and he appears on seals beside a really double-headed figure, the Janus-like Usmu, who is merely an attendant of one of the supreme gods. In fact the exclusive connection of multiplicity of eyes or heads with omniscience is by no means proven. In the iconography of the Hindus the many heads, like the many arms, of certain gods, appear to denote rather the exten- sion of power than concern with the deeds of men. Shiva, whom Professor Pettazzoni derives, like others, from the (possibly) three-headed god seated among animals on Mohenjo-daro seals, is not multiple-headed, and his third eye denotes interior vision. The three-faced carving of Shiva Mahadeva at Elephanta represents three divine persons of a trinity. Janus himself looks two ways into time and space as a god of passage, and the black-white, east-west godhead of certain American tribes represents, the author says, a prevailing male-female duality. Coming to Northern Europe, he confesses that Odin's wisdom is the fruit of the loss of an eye, and is derived from earthly magic: 'the slipping of the darkest and most ghostly of the gods into the position of supreme deity of light and heaven'. Nor is the supreme god invariably omniscient. The Homeric Zeus is not. Nor is the earlier Yahweh whose sight may be obscured by clouds. Nevertheless his theory finds wide confirmation. Among the Hittites the prayer of Muwatalli is noted as a striking record of the sun-god who reads the hearts of men. The political position of the sun-goddess as guardian of treaties does not appear. The inclusion of the several-headed Thracian Rider as an all-seeing sun-god, the reconstruction of those Thracian other-world cults which seem to have held such significance for early Greece, and the suggestion of their influence on Celtic and Slavonic Europe and possible repercussions on Western Mithraism, are very significant. The author draws an analogy between Mithras and Hermes (or rather</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS 165 the Thracian sun-god whom Herodotus calls Hermes) by way of the nocturnal sun as guide of souls. In Zoroaster's thought the Persian sky-god has lost the naturalistic character noted by Herodotus, but the foundation of his knowledge is, like Varuna's, an act of vision. The Turko-Mongolians and some other tribes of Central Asia, who have enlarged their religious scope with traits drawn from Zoroaster as well as from Northern Buddhism, are thought to have influenced the non- anthropomorphic Chinese conception of Heaven, which is naturalistic and philosophical at once: 'The celestial element in T'ien is never effaced.' In proceeding eastwards, where a Lord of Beasts is found as well as a sky-god, the author curiously omits Japanese Shinto, with its ancestral sun-goddess. Crossing the Pacific he notes, amid a great wealth of other stone- age material, some of it very beautiful, a primitive mono- theism in California 'the classic land of Supreme Beings', where omniscience is not a constant attribute. He notes the surviving influence of the cosmic dyad of ancient Mexico. Among the American hunting tribes there is sometimes an animal which creates, or helps the Creator. In this connection he quotes Kroeber on the Eskimos of Smith Sound: 'Of the two polar cosmogonic conceptions, the negative one seems to have the older and deeper roots', but because of his theory of an earliest sky-god, he does not try to relate this Lord of Beasts either with his animal- masked worshippers or with a celestial all-knowing supremacy. His final conclusion is: 'Concretely the monotheistic idea in its completeness belongs to the history of European thought, religious, theological and philosophical, under the inspiration of Christianity and having its roots in the Old Testament.' Whether or not that conclusion is wholly valid, no quick survey can possibly suggest the richness of the material gathered on the way. The translation is a fine achievement. G. R.
