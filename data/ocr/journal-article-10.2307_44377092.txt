<plain_text><page sequence="1">Speaking for the Green of the Leaf: Gary Snyder Writes Nature's Literature Julia Martin When the century began, neither human numbers nor technol- ogy had the power radically to alter planetary systems. As the century closes, not only do vastly increased human numbers and their activities have that power, but major, unintended changes are occurring in the atmosphere, in soils, in waters, among plants and animals, and in the relationships among all of these. The rate of change is outstripping the ability of scien- tific disciplines and our current capabilities to assess and advise. It is frustrating the attempts of political and economic institu- tions, which evolved in a different, more fragmented world, to adapt and cope. It deeply worries many people who are seek- ing ways to place those concerns on the political agendas. -World Commission on Environment and Development THE STATE OF THE EARTH IN THE LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY IS AT last beginning to force a new agenda. At school, our children learn words for things their parents never imagined: acid rain, ozone layer, greenhouse effect. Not only politicians and supermarket chains but even literary jour- nals are having to respond to the present crisis. In this edition of the Critic , we consider the "Literature of Nature." Perhaps this literature sounds like nothing new: Isn't it what our poets have always written? Certainly, for some people now writing poems about issues such as species extinction or vanishing rainforests, there seems to be no problem with continuing a tra- dition that Romantic or Transcendentalist writers established. Such writing may well be important, but my sense is that it's not enough. Too much has changed, and much more has yet to change if a healthy world is to be left for anyone to write about. The present ecological crisis demands of us all- teachers, readers, and writers- a fundamental transformation in attitude and practice. First, we need to see that our relation to "nature" is different from anything humans have known before. The mountains, the forests, and the 98</page><page sequence="2">Julia Martin sea that have seemed the unchanging backdrop for human activity are no longer eternal. Terence des Pres puts it like this: "Generations come and go, but that the earth abideth forever is something we need to feel, one of the foundations of poetry and humanness, and now we are not sure" (10). This uncertainty implies, as he suggests, a major readjustment. Second, we are being forced to recognize that nature never was a "back- drop" after all, and that to see it as such has been part of the problem. The central ecological insight is probably the realization that the earth is not an aggregate of "things" but a cybernetic system in which we are all inextricably related. We know that this piece of paper is made from wood, but what else is it composed of? Do we know who cut the trees? Were they paid a living wage? Where did the fuel for the trucks come from? Is the paper bleached with chlorine? Does the waste from the factory poison the fish in the rivers? Does it leach into the soil? For ecologists, the natural world is not a retreat from culture, a place of trees and flowers for taking walks if one is privileged enough. "Nature" is not a separable "other"; "I" am not a separable "self." The implications of this inseparability are signif- icant. To understand that we are nature requires a major epistemological shift. This leads us, third, to reconsider the ruthless exploitation of "natural resources"- plants, minerals, people, animals- by which our civilization is fueled. We live in an essentially exploitative society, characterized by the domination of women by men, of class by class, and of what we call "nature" by what we call "culture." Now, as we enter what has been called the Decade of the Environment, we need to acknowledge the extent of the harm that this domination h√°s done: -Every day, one wildlife species becomes extinct. -Every second, one acre of tropical rainforest is destroyed. -At present in South Africa, hundreds of people are still in detention for their opposition to apartheid. -The average American consumes 30 times as much energy as the African, and worldwide, 30% of landowners own 80% of the land. -Women still do 2/3 of the world's work, earn 1/20 of its in- come, and own 1/100 of its assets. -The hole in the ozone layer is now bigger than the United States and deeper than Mount Everest. How do these situations affect our literature? In recent years, poetry and fiction have begun to express the changed perspective that an ecologi- cal awareness implies. Rewriting the "nature" of Western tradition, current 99</page><page sequence="3">Critic 54:1 literature frequently attempts, as Patrick Murphy puts it, to render nonhu- man others as "speaking subjects" ("Ground" 12). This turns "the literature of nature" into something like "nature's literature," introducing texts that require another sort of reading. One of the first writers to be in this sense consciously "ecological" was the poet Gary Snyder. In the Pulitzer Prize- winning collection Turtle Island (1974), he described his role as that of "a voice from the wilderness, my constituency" (106). At the time, this voice was a fairly isolated one. Now, as more writers begin speaking an eco- logical language, it is useful to look more closely at Snyder's ecopolitical writing. My essay will concentrate on material from the '70s and early '80s, paying particular attention to Turtle Island . Gary Snyder's long-time opposition to repressive structures is informed by a radical interpretation of Buddhism, ecology, and anthropology. In his writing, this opposition takes the form of a profound rejection of the process by which "other" races and classes, women, nature, and animals have been marginalized, exploited, and most particularly silenced by the dominant culture. The strength of this perspective is that it recognizes the existence of simultaneous exploitations and seeks to interrogate the dualistic, binary thinking by which these are legitimized. My interest in Snyder derives, no doubt, from my experience of grow- ing up in apartheid South Africa. Where I come from, it is more than usually difficult for writers, or anyone else, to pretend that their work is not informed by the injustices of our society. This means that I am excited most by writing that consciously engages with the context in which it is produced, speaking in a voice that is committed to dislodge the hegemonic codes. For Snyder, the reasons for such commitment are clear. His writing attempts to alert people to the urgency of our situation by giving utterance to some of the voices that the dominant discourse has silenced. His project corresponds significantly to a tendency in feminist projects. Writing about the emphasis in French feminism on a specifically feminine discourse, Gay- atri Chakravorty Spivak quotes Xaviere Gauthier: Women must learn to "speak otherwise," to "make audible (what) . . . suffers silently in the holes of discourse" (165). My discussion of Snyder's poetry is in four parts. Part one treats his fairly rhetorical rejection of some aspects of the discourse of mainstream Western culture; part two, his identification with the silenced voices of what that culture defines as Other; and part three, the use of metaphors for a conceptual model that proposes an alternative to the binary opposition of Self and Other. This discussion is followed in part four by questions and some concluding remarks. I As early as 1969 and even before, Snyder described what he considered to be the repressive thrust of the dominant Western culture in terms of 100</page><page sequence="4">Julia Martin sexual politics, identifying its origins within the "patriarchal, patrilineal family" (EHH 106). In attacking this value system, his poetry becomes polemical and angry. Whereas much of Snyder's work is characterized by its attention to minute particulars, his most overtly political writing depends to some extent on generalization and caricature. Like some radical feminist rhetoric, his critique of the dominant discourse is strategically useful, if somewhat reactive and philosophically dubious. Here is a characteristic example from the poem "Mother Earth: Her Whales"(77 47-49): How can the head-heavy power-hungry politic scientist Government two-world Capitalist-Imperialist Third-world Communist paper-shuffling male non-farmer jet-set bureaucrats Speak for the green of the leaf? Speak for the soil? The invective is sharp, the attack directed toward an agency that is clearly androcentric. Earlier in the same poem, the familiar oppositions are re- versed in a similar way. Human beings become Other, robot-like; nature is alive and sentient: The living actual people of the jungle sold and tortured And a robot in a suit who peddles a delusion called "Brazil" can speak for them ? If the dominant discourse (and economic and political practice) has no language for "the green of the leaf," for Snyder this lack is due in part to a religious model that tends to give primacy to the transcendental Word, effectively silencing Other voices. Although in recent years there has been some critique of this silencing from within the Church, the mainstream Judaeo-Christian world view has, historically, assumed that a feminized "nature" is something from which we are (or should be) distinct: "Man" names the animals, keeps the land. Snyder describes this attempt to raise man above his (sic) environment, somewhat rhetorically, as follows: "men are seen working out their ultimate destinies (paradise? perdition?) with planet earth as the stage for their drama- trees and animals mere props, nature a vast supply depot" (77 103). Several early poems (for example in Myths &amp; Texts) identify in this system of values the origins of the present ecological crisis. In Turtle Island , the conflation of nature and "the feminine" that the paradigm implies appears in the poem "Front Lines" (77 104). The effect is a strong polemic against capitalist America's acquisitive devastation of the wilderness: "Landseekers, lookers, they say /To the land /Spread your legs." Later in the poem, the metaphor of rape is extended in the depiction of a disgustingly destructive bulldozer ("grinding and slobbering 101</page><page sequence="5">Critic 54:1 /sideslipping and belching on top of / the skinned-up bodies of still-live bushes") in the pay of "a man from town." As these extracts suggest, Snyder reads the patriarchal construction of nature as feminine Other as being linked to the idea that nature is something hostile and dangerous, an adversary. The corollary is the view that the "natural" desires (particularly sexual) are fallen and dangerous: "To make 'human nature' suspect is also to make Nature- the Wilderness- the adversary" (EHH 115). In an early poem, "Logging 15" (M&amp;T 57), Snyder identifies the repression this involves as follows: Men who hire men to cut groves Kill snakes, build cities, pave fields Believe in god, but can't Believe their own senses Let alone Guatama. Let them lie. The view that one is "above nature" implies that one can't afford to believe the senses. This attitude is seen here to be symptomatic of a culture that has denigrated the value of the senses in favor of the bliss of a supranatural- istic heaven, where all experience is incorporeal. A poem called "The Call of the Wild" (77 21-22), for example, examines the connotations of "wild- ness" for a culture founded in dualistic metaphysics. The poem describes "a war against earth" that corresponds to a war against (or repression of) the "natural" self. Ironically, certain members of the so-called countercul- ture (dreaming of India, of "forever blissful sexless highs") are shown to be as alienated from wild systems as is the dominant (specifically American) culture that they superficially oppose. The outcome of the transcendental metaphysics that they share is horrible destruction, launched from a posi- tion that is, like that of all sky gods, high above the earth. Once airborne, the Americans never come down for they found the ground is pro-Communist. And dirty. And the insects side with the Viet Cong Once having enlisted the mentality that identifies the Other as enemy, any destruction can be sanctioned: So they bomb and they bomb Day after day, across the planet blinding sparrows breaking the ear-drums of owls splintering trunks of cherries twining and looping 102</page><page sequence="6">Julia Martin deer intestines in the shaken, dusty, rocks. II In an early essay, Snyder refers to a marginal tradition that has ex- isted alongside the dominant, historically antifeminist, religion of Jehovah. Much of the poetry seeks to revive the subversive potential of this counter- tradition, which celebrates "woman as nature the field for experiencing the universe as sacramentar (EHH 124). To speak of "woman" and "nature" in this way means to identify with that which the dominant culture constructs as Other. This reversal of value has historical analogues in, for example, the black consciousness movement, and it corresponds closely with those women writers who, as Julia Kristeva puts it, seek to "give a language to the intrasubjective and corporeal experiences left mute by culture in the past" (37). In Snyder's case, this involves giving expression to the "voice from the wilderness, my constituency" (77 106). Two important features are the use of metaphors of descent and a revaluation of the quotidian. Like many women writers (I think of Adrienne Rich, Susan Griffin, Mar- garet Atwood), Snyder often uses metaphors of descent to indicate an at- tempt to recover what has been drowned, buried, marginalized, and si- lenced by the dominant discourse. The metaphor works at several levels, as the poem "Anasazi" (77 3), a description of an imaginative descent into Native America's so-called primitive past, illustrates. The speaker's recon- struction of the social system of the Anasazi reveals mysteries inherent in their daily activities: growing, watching, giving birth. The close spiri- tual identification with nature that this involves contrasts strongly with the supranaturalistic emphasis of patriarchal monotheism. In an experience of shamanistic identification, the human person is drenched and absorbed in the nonhuman. The gods are encountered through descent into the material, rather than through spiritual transcendence: sinking deeper and deeper in earth up to your hips in Gods your head all turned to eagle-down and lightning for knees and elbows your eyes full of pollen the smell of bats the flavor of sandstone grit on the tongue women birthing at the foot of ladders in the dark. 103</page><page sequence="7">Critic 54:1 In this account, the speaker's immersion in the holy involves a progressive absorption into the maternal earth. Engaging the "lower" part of the body ("hips" rather than heart or mind), this experience is sensual- physical- as much as it is spiritual or mental. Descending deep enough into the ground reveals the continued presence of women who are giving birth. Their place in the "dark" reinforces the effect of "down" and "earth," contrasting strongly with the "light," "ascent," and "sky" of patriarchal religion. Simi- larly, in foregrounding women's labor, in identifying it as being, precisely in its physicality, simultaneously a spiritual experience, the poem reverses the dominant view of both "woman" and bodily functions. Syntactically, the use of indefinite participles suggests that this is not an isolated moment on history's timeline. Instead, such sacramental experience is part of a continuous process, and therefore always accessible. To emphasize descent in this way implies for Snyder an orientation that is repeated in numerous other poems about wilderness, women, bodies, animals, and the so-called primitive. In proposing an alternative to the tendency in patriarchal monotheism to stress transcendence of the mate- rial world, such poetry recalls traditions that model this very world as being sacramental. One consequence of this emphasis is a revaluation of what Adrienne Rich has called "the enormity of the simplest things" (261), those unobtrusive, hidden, everyday activities that facilitate the progress of the dominant culture. In place of a focus on achieving spiritual transcen- dence of material limits, the poetry repeatedly proposes the importance of mindful attention to ordinary daily activities. Many of the poems there- fore celebrate activities that are often viewed as either trivial or mundane, or insignificant: doing housework, eating and preparing food, gardening, making love, caring for children, looking at animals and plants, fixing ma- chinery. This view of the quotidian is partly informed by Snyder's involvement with Zen Buddhism, a discipline stressing attention to simple particulars- no activity is intrinsically more valuable than another, and all activities are interconnected. But for Snyder, as for many feminist writers, to write poetry celebrating ordinary activities is also a political choice. If patriarchal discourse silences not only woman and nature but also the sort of work habitually done by women and subject peoples, then it becomes important to assert the value of such silenced work. Ill To foreground and defend marginalized Other in the ways I have de- scribed may be a necessary response to exploitative mastery. But for Sny- der, as Buddhist and ecologist, such reversal of value is useful only to the extent that it makes possible a conceptual model not founded in binary oppositions. The function of Snyder's treatment of "nature" and "woman" is, paradoxically, to approach such a model. 104</page><page sequence="8">Julia Martin As I noted at the beginning, what we call "nature" is, from an ecolog- ical viewpoint, not an aggregate of competing, autonomous entities but a cybernetic system in which organism and environment are interdepen- dent. To see this relation in terms of binary oppositions (Self-Other, Nature- Culture) is to misinterpret the necessary exchange of information and en- ergy between constituent participants. In representing this understanding of the natural ecosystem, Snyder's poetry from the period under discussion draws metaphors from those versions of goddess mythology and Buddhism that emphasize the arbitrariness of binary dichotomies. For example, the Buddhist term prajna-paramita denotes wisdom that has gone beyond all dualisms. But it is also, simultaneously, the name of a goddess. Paradox- ical symbolism of this kind is particularly clear in Snyder's account of the goddesses Gaia ("the great biosphere being") and Vak ("the Voice through all"). In each case, the use of the goddess as metaphor of ecological inter- dependence suggests a basis for a nonbinary conceptual model. Snyder uses "Gaia" to refer to the planetary ecosystem, the biosphere, the whole earth. This allusion to the primal earth mother suggests a view of "nature" as interdependent system. In Axe Handles , one of the "Little Songs for Gaia" (49) describes it as follows: ah, this slow-paced system of systems, whirling and turning a five-thousand-year span about all that a human can figure, grasshopper man in his car driving through. Like a Chinese landscape painting in which human beings are depicted as diminutive figures in a vast natural environment, the poem provides a setting for (and so defamiliarizes) the impact of human agency. In contrast to the hawk's free flight, the insectlike "man in his car" follows a linear track through "nature" as though he is separable from it. But his point of view, which foregrounds the human in opposition to the environment and limits history to five thousand "civilized" years, is qualified by the rest of the poem. By attending to the world that his view marginalizes, the poem evokes an image of the whole biosphere, Gaia, that ancient "system of systems," within whose rhythmic "whirling and turning" each individual is necessarily a participant. Snyder frequently uses the related metaphors of the net, the woven fab- ric or web, and the family to evoke this view of the biosphere. Like Mary Daly in Gyn /Ecology (1), Snyder associates the traditionally feminine ac- tivity of weaving this network of correspondences with a mother goddess, specifically "Mother Gaia." Appropriately, then, in place of the nuclear family as isolated unit, the speaker is located as a member of the family of all beings. The poem "On San Gabriel Ridges" (77 40) is a characteristic 105</page><page sequence="9">Critic 54:1 example. Seeing the designs of twigs and seeds that have impressed them- selves on his skin, the speaker recognizes his participation in the fabric of interconnection. Old friends and lovers, children, squirrel, and fox are all woven in its pattern, and the present moment is similarly informed by the past, to which it is still connected: O loves of long ago hello again, and all of us together with all our other loves and children twining and knotting through each other- intricate, chaotic, done. Family relationships are shown to be part of the same process that links squirrel and fox in the food chain: woven into the dark, squirrel hairs, squirrel bones crunched tight and dry in scats of fox. The poem suggests that the life of each is, often quite literally, bound up with that of the others- dissolved, rotten, and reconstituted in a new form. This evidence of the food chain is, then, for Snyder probably the clearest sign of our interdependence in the "family" of Gaia, and many poems deal with this exchange of energies, what he calls "eating each other." Here, as before, the metaphors work to subvert the habitual view of the individual (self, family, class, nation, gender, species) as something separable from the environment. In Regarding Wave , the goddess Vak is the focusing metaphor for a similar perception of the interdependence of self and ecosystem. Looking at the texture of the phenomenal world, the speaker finds that all things (including himself) are wave-patterned, various expressions of an energy he calls "a shimmering bell /through all" (RW 45). As Vak, or "Voice," this omnipresent energy is metaphorically depicted as a lover. But, as with the image of Gaia as mother, the feminine symbolism refers to the ecosystem as a whole rather than to something outside of and separate from the self. The poems "Wave" and "Regarding Wave" (RW 13, 45) convey the role (simultaneously observer and participant) that this concept implies for the speaker.1 IV If the dominant discourse cannot speak for "the green of the leaf," then Snyder's work seeks a language for what has been silenced. In response 106</page><page sequence="10">Julia Martin to the dualistic model that structures experience in terms of binary opposi- tions, and so legitimizes the repression and exploitation of the Other, this poetry offers a view of the universe as an interpenetrating network of cor- respondences. By foregrounding what the dominant culture has marginal- ized, much of Snyder's writing finds in a metaphorically feminized ecosys- tem a model of interconnection and relationship that attempts to resist binary division and the exploitation such division implies. Snyder's view, which he has called "a spiritual ecology," is not dependent on belief in a metaphysical "other realm." Instead, it is based on the observation that individual and environment are interdependent, that social formations and psychic relations are inextricable. Of course, there are contradictions. First, there is the problem any op- positional discourse has in attempting to "talk back": One's own voice takes shape as another text, to be encoded as yet another part of the dominant discourse. Partly for this reason, Zen Buddhist texts characteristically avoid assertions of belief, seeking rather, through paradoxical and illogical ex- pression, to disrupt the sequential, dualistic thinking encoded in language. Julia Kristeva argues similarly that "Once it is represented, even by the form of a woman, the 'truth' of the unconscious passes into the symbolic order" (155), and the Tao Te Ching opens with the words, "The Way which can be spoken is not the Way." And yet we must go on speaking. A second problem concerns Snyder's tendency to caricature the Western tradition, his consequent identification with its repressed Other, and his use of a gendered image (a goddess) as metaphor for a nondualistic view. Does this not involve a mere reversal of the current model, generating an inverted image of the combatted power, preparing the way for another pattern of dominance, another totalizing ideology? If the simultaneous exploitation of women and the natural biosphere has derived ideological support from the supposed association between "woman" and "nature," is the attempt to renew this association in the metaphors of Gaia and Vak not harmful and regressive? Why use an anthropomorphic metaphor anyway, when its purpose is to evoke a world in which humans are only part of the picture?2 For Snyder as Zen poet, all such metaphors, like any linguistic articula- tion of a nondualistic perspective, are provisional and tentative: Any given metaphor can be valuable as long as it is strategically useful and emotion- ally compelling. When 1 interviewed Snyder in 1988, he conceded that gendered metaphors for nature are potentially problematic and suggested that Gaia was "a theatrical device" to be used only "as long as it plays" ("Coyote-Mind" 161). In his recent contributions to nature's literature, the network of interdependence is evoked in descriptions of what he calls "the wild."3 There is little mention of goddesses. 107</page><page sequence="11">Critic 54:1 It should be clear that my reading of Snyder's position is generally sym- pathetic. I make my own position explicit because no reading is neutral. Our situation demands that readers, writers, and teachers of literature en- gage with issues that concern us deeply. From deconstruction and Buddhist teaching, we know about the relativity of all propositions of belief and the fiction of a grounding truth, a transcendental signified.4 And yet, in these uncertain times, there are some things we can be sure of: The earth is one system, and our lives are interdependent; we live in a suffering world, and there is nowhere else to go. Whatever else may be said, the planetary biosphere, "nature" if you like, is the ground of all our meanings. Snyder calls it "our only sacred spot": This small blue-green planet is the only one with comfortable temperatures, good air and water, a wealth of animals and plants, for millions (or quadrillions) of miles. A little waterhole in Vast Space, a nesting place, a place of singing and practice, a place of dreaming. It's on the verge of being totally trashed- there's a slow way and a fast way. We are all natives here, and this is our only sacred spot. We must know that we've been jumped, and fight like a raccoon in a pack of hounds, for our own and all other lives. ("Wild" 15) Certainly, neither textual revolution nor engaged criticism can substitute for social and political transformation. For Snyder, writing poetry is only part of a much wider practice. Poems can't feed the hungry or heal the ozone layer or liberate women or bring justice in South Africa. But sometimes they can disturb our old opinions, enter our dreams, and help us to find new words.5 Notes ]See my discussion of this in "The Pattern Which Connects: Metaphor in Gary Snyder's Later Poetry." 2 Patrick Murphy raises similar objections in more detail in his useful essay, "Sex-Typing the Planet: Gaia Imagery and the Problem of Subverting Patriarchy."
