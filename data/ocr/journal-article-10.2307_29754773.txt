<plain_text><page sequence="1">Preliminary Report on the Researches at Hazar Sum (Samangan) (Italian Archeological Mission iu Afghanistan) PART II. (a) * Schematic Figurations on the Walls of the Cave dwellings at Hazar Sum During the systematic exploration of the caves at Haz?r Sum, for the purpose of preparing the general map of the area (see Part I), special interest was aroused by the plastic and pictorial motifs preserved on parts of the stucco, coating the walls of the dwel? lings. In addition to this decoration, an important series of scratched drawings was im? mediately noticed, recalling themes that frequently recur in the prehistoric schematic art of Western Europe. It was not possible to carry to completion the examination of the figures, and we shall therefore restrict ourselves only to an account. Fundamental schemes repeat themselves almost constantly, and although differences in patina may be noticed ? it being at times the same colour as the stucco, and at times slightly dimmed by dust, a common feature in both more ancient and more recent en? gravings ? there are no substantial differences in regard either to the subject or to the style. The size of the figures *? without considering the hands which are life-size because drawn by means of following their outlines ? varies from a maximum of 20 centimetres, to a minimum of 3 centimetres. The tool used in engraving the drawings must have been a very sharp sliver of wood or, more likely, a metal point. Where the engraved line appears to be thicker, one notes small cracks along the margins, due to the crumbling of flakes of stucco close to the intentionally traced line. The carved subjects fall into four general categories: a) human figures, b) drawings of hands, c) drawings of animals, d) combinations whose meaning * Part I has been published in ?East and West?, n.s. 14, 1-2, 1963. 183</page><page sequence="2">is uncertain. There are also groups in which drawings of human beings, animals, water and others more difficult to interpret are linked together to represent a scene. Among the most interesting motifs are those similar to the representations consi? dered by scholars of prehistoric art to be stylized human figures. Although unfrequently, human figures appear at Haz?r Sum under numerous forms: among these the tree-shap? ed man or, to be more precise, ? the pine-man ? with three branches. The vertical line presents a short upper and lower addition to the oblique bars which slant downwards (PI. 1, Fig. 1). A similar stylization has been frequently met with found in the Spanish peninsula, especially in the eastern zone. ? Pine-men ? of two, three or even more le? vels, of branch-lines with their limbs upraised, or horizontal or slanting downward as in our drawings, are present at Nuestra Senora del Castillo, Las Moriscas, Los Buitres. Malas Cabras, Nuestra Senora de Esperanga, Hoz del Guadiana, on the written stone of Fuencaliente, at Morcielaguilla de la Cepera, El Retamoso, Covatilla del Rabanero, Tajo del Aguila, at the refuge of Val di Charco, at Cueva Maina, and at Piedras de la Cera (*), examined by Obermaier (2) and Breuil (3), who related them to identical figu? rations on the painted stones of Ma6 d'Azil published by Piette (4), as works either mesolithic, or of mesolithic derivation. Conti assigns the cruciform schematic types which he found at Monte Bego (5) to the same period. Camon Aznar notes still other similar figures at Pen?n de la Visera (6), but, in the belief that human stylization has any connection with the stones of Mas d'Azil (7), he places them in the early Bronze Age, to be more precise, between 2800 and 2700 B.C. (8). Buchner ha6 recently found in the Grotta delle Felci (Capri) stones with schematic anthropomorphic paintings which correspond perfectly to those of Mas d'Azil, whose age does not extend beyond the neolithic period (*)?

Lenape stone ?, he thinks they are wooden ladders formed by a central shaft crossed by numerous rods, used for the gather? ing of honey and birds' eggs (10). The human figure does not appear as a simple ladder-form at Haz?r Sum (**); in more than one case (PI. II, Fig6. 11 and 13), it is found inscribed within a limiting line which goes from oval forms to others almost rectangular, constituting the so-called ? blazon ? or cc shield ?. Shield-shaped figures are very widespread in prehistoric art, as is shown in the representations at Puerto de Vistalegre and Helechal, Nuestra Senora del Castillo, Las Moriscas, refuge of Las Vinas, Los Buitres, Curral das Letras, Penon Grande, Cachao de Rapa and La Vache (12), generally dated to the early Bronze Age because of resemblances to the representations on the plaque-idols of that period (13). Conti, who found inscribed tree-forms at Monte Bego, gives a much earlier chrono? logy for his carvings, not even excluding the possibility that they might go back to an interglacial phase (14). Issel reports about analogous figurations from Oreo Feligno which he thinks to be conventional signs of tribes or single shepherds (15). Bicknell too publishes geometric figures ? similar to the Egyptian cartouches ? from Val Fontanalba and from Val Me raviglie (16). Cam?n Aznar gives an interesting interpretation of the inscribed tree-forms: he dates them back to the neolithic and, keeping in mind that the group counts much more than the individual in the society of that period, he sees in these images collective emblems in which each arm might represent a different person. We thus would be dealing with representations of clan, and he in fact calls these drawings cc tribe-men ? (17). One notes among the other representations a mushroom-shaped figure (PI. I, Fig. 2) made up of a semicircle with the curve on top, cut by a vertical line and accompanied by (I0) G. Vinaccia, Les signes oVobscure signification dans Vart paleolithique, in L'Anthropologie, XXXVI, 1926, pp. 41-46. (n) The ladder-forms of Haz?r Sum are always made of a single vertical line; up to now no real ladder-forms of the type common to the Spanish pe? ninsula and the carvings of Monte Bego have been found.

This scheme too belongs to the repertory of human stylizations with arms united to the body-shaft, already found at Monte Bego, Valais (Switzer? land), Nuestra Senora de Esperan?a, Les Greus, Mas de Carles, Cueva de las Vacas del Retamoso, in the dolmen of Cueva Menga and in that of Barranc. Signs of this kind are also found among the very numerous ones engraved at La ja de los Hierros near Cadiz and at Clonfinloch (Ireland) (18). The two curved motifs which accompany this sign have also been interpreted as ? anthropomorphic female bow-shaped figures ?. They are known at Los Poyadillos, La Canada del Monte, and on the painted stones from Mas d'Azil, and are to be found in the lower half of the end slab of the dolmen of the ? Table des Marchands ? at Locma riaquer (lf). Figures strictly related to the one we have just described are those (PL I, Fig. 6 and 7; PI. IV, Fig. 2) whose circle faces down and is barred vertically. They are like those noted at El Muro de Helechosa, Jimena de Jaen and Clonfinloch (20). These are variations on the typical scheme of the ? 9-shaped man ?. Closer to the representation of the individual with attached arms is the image which may be seen in the middle of PL IV, Fig. 1. The vertically cut circle close to the zig-zag lines is a very frequent motif in stylized art. Twelve figures of this type are in fact to be found at Puerto de Vistalegre, others at El Retamoso near Aldeaquemada, at Cova tilla del Rabanero, at Covatilla de S. Juan, Cueva de Los Letreros, the Runcu and Po? lo vraci caves, Clonfinloch, Monte Bego, and in the lower part of the slate slab of Triora (21). Even more numerous in wall-paintings or carvings on stone are the figures in which the barred circle ends with little feet, or has eyes (two dots either inside or outside the figure) (22). On the wall of the caves of Haz?r Sum one also finds the ? T ? motif and the (18) Monte Bego : see C. Conti, op. cit., p. 12, Fig. 3: 4, and Fig. 5: 1, 2; Valais: A. Glory, J. Sanz Martinez, P.

This extreme styliza tion, which appears in Figure 3 accompanied by a comb-shaped form (man and animal), had been noted in both the ? T ? and ? anchor ? forms at Covachas, Hoz del Guadiana, near Aldeaquemada, at Covatilla del Rabanero, at Tajo del Aguila, at Palla Rubia (23), and, carved, in the Bronze Age tombs in both Portugal and southern France (Trigares, Curton Jugazan, Peyrebad Bellefond, Fargues) (24). In the dolmens these feetless figu? res take the place formerly reserved to the double-triangle idols. One, furnished with small pits under the curve, is carved on a plaque from Cueva de Monier (25). Anchor-shaped figures of terracotta, from the Early Bronze Age, were also found at Malta (Borg in Nadur) (26), and in Macedonia (Servia, Kritsan?, Armenochori, Saratse, Hagios Mamas) (27). An example recently came to light at Torre Castelluccia (Puglia) in an Iron Age stratum (28). Even those shapes reduced to the mere representation of the eyes must be consi? dered human figures. This was one of the most wide-spread figures from prehistory on? wards (29); when the motif is surrounded by rays, there arises the question of interpreting it as an eye or as the sun: the problem is solved when the image has a further sign in the middle which can be recognized as a pupil. In our case (PL I, Fig. 4), the signs close together, and supplied with pupils, leave no doubt as to the intention of de? signing an ocular motif. But our figuration is accompanied by a lower cc chevron ? motif placed horizontally. As regards prehistoric 6tylized art, this sign (Estrecho de Santonje, Cueva del Mediodia del Arabi, Cantos de la Visera, Los Buitres, Cueva del Muro del Castillo de Alange, Puerto de Vistalegre, Puerto de las Gradas) has been re? cognized as a group of seated human figures (30); but such an explanation is no doubt quite unlikely for the representation at Haz?r Sum. We find a combination of eyes and a lower zig-zag line in the decoration of some vase fragments from Hissarlik (31); ac (2S) Covachas: see E. Breuil, op. cit., IV, PI.

Dechelette, Manuel d'Archeologie, I, Paris, 1924, p. 597. 1S7</page><page sequence="6">cording to Dechelette*s opinion, in this case the motif might indicate the tattooing of a human face, as may be proved by the habit of tattoo-painting the body with similar signs still practised by primitive populations for special ceremonies (32). At other times the eye motif linked by a vertical line to some horizontal ? chevrons ? is interpreted as representing a ceremonial mask (33) or as a human figure furnished with arms (34). Going back to the zig-zag line engraved on a vase from Maikop (35), assumed to be a mountain-chain, we might perhaps interpret our design as a deity on mountains. In fact, among peoples which share to some degree a nomadic-pastoral civilization, God is conceived as a supreme being who resides in heaven and who knows everything because he sees everything (36). Another motif links the figurations of Haz?r Sum to those which go back to the be? ginnings of figurative art. We are referring to the presence of the hands which appear at Haz?r Sum with the usual technique of carving obtained through outlining the hand placed with fingers spread against the wall. In Fig. 8 (PI. I) we see a left hand, as is most probably the one shown in Fig 9; here a connected sign seems to represent a sixth finger (perhaps due to a change of position and to a repetition in drawing), so that its nature is not clearly shown. This design is generally assumed to be the first to appear in attempts at artistic expression (37). It perhaps originated accidentally (38) when a hand stained with color was braced against a wall, and might then have been endlessly repeat? ed, sometimes as a game, sometimes connected with magical practices as shown in hands associated with animal figures (3*), and sometimes to ? perpetuate the remembrance of oneself through time ? (40). Numerous hands, both negative and positive, appear in the French-Spanish caves (Altamira, Castillo, La Pasiega, Gargas, Tibiran, Trois Freres, Le Portel, Pech-Merle, Rocamadour, Font-de-Gaume, Bern ifal, Beyssac, Collins, Baume-Latrone) (41), going back for the most part to the Aurignatian. This symbol was often used in primitive alphabets with the value of a written word (") J. A.

One might say that it is not restricted within chronological, geographical and ideo? logical : in all likelihood it represents, as we are inclined to think for the drawings of hands at Haz?r Sum, the vivid and lasting record of a presence, the signature of a man to whom writing is still unknown. The richest figurative production is no doubt supplied by animal stylizations: they cover more than half of the entire range. The animals represented are reduced to their essential lines: a bar for the body, others for the legs and the horns. They appear singly or, more often, in small groups; sometimes (PI. IV) forming an actual composition. They are drawn with a line more or less marked, and are almost always in profile, tending to an exceptional lengthening of the limbs, with highly developed horns pointing to the rear. In PI. II, Fig. 14, there is one of the very rare cases in which the horns are shown in a front view. The tail is one of the elements which succeed, even in the uniformity due to the schematic style, in making the figures slightly distinctive from one another, being either upturned (angled or rounded), horizontal, or downturned; in one case (PL H, Fig. 13) it is curly. The animal's face is less frequently shown (PL II, Fig. 1, 2, 9 and PL IV, Fig. 1), and is more often indicated by a simple extension of the body line, or else is completely missing. There are almost always four legs, but there are also three legged animals (PL II, Fig. 8) or two-legged ones (PL H, Figs. 3, 10, 11). In one instance (PL II, Fig. 13) the extremities end in little circles. Figures with feet-disc6 appear in pre-Cameline and Cameline art of North Africa: elephants and giraffes of Uadi Masa?da I (43), elephants of Adrar Ahnet (44) and Uadi Taghit (45). stillo: H.

The giraffe of Uadi Masa?da is pro? bably included in the late hunting art of Berging', which is said to go back to the neolithic, a fact con? firmed also by the objects found in loco. The elephant figure, however, seems superimposed on the ostrich figures, and cannot be very old: this last animal ap? pears only in the recent Cameline Age. (See P.

(PL II, Fig. 12 and PL I, Fig. 3) and ? synthetic ? animals, as shown by the example with many feet in PL II, Fig. 14. In another two cases (PI. II, Fig. 5 and 14) we find highly schematic figures with a different perspective, almost a projection from above: they too might represent animals. Given the stylization, it is not easy to identify the animals shown, but, from the long horns pointing backwards, the small beard of PI. II, Fig. 2, and the little face of PI. II, Fig. 9, we can assume them to be goats (46). As indicated above, most of the animals are shown in small compositions and, even through the simplicity of the technique and the facility of the expression, the figures are marked by a strong vitality. In PL II, Fig. 1, there is almost certainly a pregnant animal, as implied by the prominent belly with an undefined mark inside it; the double outline, to be found only in this case, makes the figure slightly heavy, but the drawing gains a certain freshness of detail from the addition of small lines which indicate rudi? mentary hoofs. The small four-footed animal with open jaws and short ears which is following it, is most probably a dog. Figure 6 (PL II) with its long horns which seem to be entangled in the meshes of a net certainly represents an animal in a fenced area or trap. Net-shaped and roof-shaped schemes are often met with in prehistoric drawings (Cueva del Mas del Abogat, cave of Font-de-Gaune, cave of Bernifal, Cueva de Buxu, Altamira, Castillo, Marsoulas, La Pa? siega) (47); they are sometimes interpreted as totemic symbols, sometimes as huts or dwellings of the spirits of ancestors (48), more often as traps or nets (4*), an idea which would be supported by the animals being frequently shown near such scheme or even link? ed to them. There is an animal in PL IV which has different characteristics: rectangular hoofs, full face, lowered tail and curved horns; it belongs undoubtedly to the cattle fa? mily. In fact, the detail of the semicircular horns for the animal represented both in (**) They cannot be stags because this animal always shows the branching of the horns, even if stylized. The mouflon has characteristic spiral horns. The drawings might be taken for antelopes (orix leucorix or antilope cervicapra), but the semi-elliptical horns make us think that they represent wild goats (capra hircus aegagrus), an animal still very common in the region, or ibex (capra nubiana), which seems to have survived in the mountainous zones.

The figure of the dromedary never appears, although it had been known in the re? gion for centuries, and should have aroused some sort of artistic attraction, owing to its peculiar shape. All the animals represented, with a clear majority of goats, belong therefore to a pastoral world and represent scenes of everyday life (51). For them too the analogies are worthy of note. Schematic animals like ours already appear on some Trojan spindles (2nd city) (52). As at Haz?r Sum (PL II, Fig. 3 and 8), animal figures with their off? spring shown right beside them appear at Rabanero (53) and at Reboso de la Sierra de la Virgen del Castillo (54). The interpretation of animals fused together, given to the figures with many legs, present in prehistoric art (El Rabanero, Los Letreros) ("), is also valid for the examples at Haz?r Sum. This is not the place to li&amp;t at length the very numerous comb-shaped prehistoric drawings (56); however, on the basis of a reconstruction of the steps which led up to their interpretation, we can understand the comb-shaped designs of Haz?r Sum. As regards the goat figures, another relationship can be established with the motifs of oriental ceramics (Susa I and n, Tepe Hissar I, Tepe Giyan V, Tepe Musyan, Kara Tepe, Siyalk IH? Mundigak IV, Mersin Xllb) (") and with seals (Susa I) (58). (50) G.

Ill, Fig. 7) which appears often, certainly in? dicates water, perhaps under the form of rain (?) or, as clearly appears in PI. IV, of a brook. Carved zig-zag lines associated with stylized human figures, on a paleolithic bone from Denmark (60) have been interpreted as water. Numerous ? arrow ? zig-zags, assumed to be symbols of lightning, are known in the series of archaic engravings of Monte Bego (61). ? Water lines ?, referring to particular magical-religious ideologies, appear frequently in the decoration of the prehistoric ceramics of Tellok I, Tepe Giyan V, Ar? pachiyak (62), Nakada I, Persepolis, Shahi Tump and in numerous vases from Susa (63); a fragment from this last area presents a water motif which shows the waters flowing towards a basin together with the representation of comb-shaped animals (64). This scheme is often found in the brands of the vase-makers, almost as if to recall the pur? pose of the vessel (b5); it is present on seals (noteworthy the one which shows a personage of the court of Sargon I) (6b), and in Egyptian reliefs and paintings from the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms (67). The meaning is obvious in the frequent zig-zag designs traced horizontally, with an animal drinking, like those in the cave of Gabal (Velez Blanco) (68), and on a fragment of painted ceramic from the first level of Tepe Siyalk (6*). This sign was one of the first to be interpreted in the hieroglyphic alphabets, with the mean? ing of water (70). It is found again, always with the same meaning, in carved or paint? ed scenes on the walls of some megalithic Caucasian cists, like that of Chapsougo (71). (59) The sign on a vase from Romachki has been interpreted in this way. See B. Ribakov, Calendrier agraire et magique des anciens Polianes, in ?

Radiating circles also appear at Haz?r Sum (PL III, Fig. 1 and 3). These ?wheel? figurations (those found up to now have only internal rays) are universally known as solar symbols. Of the literature on this matter, as regards both the designs (wheel shaped, star-shaped, etc.) and their cultural value, we shall only cite that which allows us to make some comparisons proving the diffusion of these signs in space and time. Conti publishes star-shaped forms among the incisions of Monte Bego (74). Others are known at Fontanalba and from the Regione delle Meraviglie (75). Examples of circles with four bars appear in the rock-carvings associated with the decoration of the triangular copper dagger (&lt;b). Radiating discs of ceramics have been found in the caves of Gard and Aude (77). A solar wheel is carved on the walls of the Peyort cave (Ariege) ( 8), another is painted on the walls of the Charbonnier cave (79), others are scratched in the caves of Runcu and Polovraci (80), still others on the dolmen of Petit Mont (81) and on the dol? men of Barranc (Espolla) (82). These figurations have been attributed to the Copper or Bronze Age, through comparisons with solar wheels in metal. Another similar design is seen on the stone slab of Triora (83). Still another sign frequent in the French and Iberian areas is very often found re? produced on the walls of the caves of Haz?r Sum. We are referring to the representa? tion of a long horizontal bar, sometimes oblique, crossed by shorter vertical bars (PL III, Fig. 6 and 8). Breuil cites a large number of them, among which those of Morciela guilla de la Cepera, Piedra Escrita de Fuencaliente (84), and the neolithic funerary chamber of Villenevard (Marne) (85); sometimes he calls them ((barriers)), and again ((structures)) : in this case he thinks that we are dealing with the representation of huts (86).

A horizontal bar crossed by four vertical bars, noted in the dolmen of Moureous (Lavenalet, Ariege) together with anthropomorphic cross-forms, is interpreted as the representation of four persons holding hands (88). The barred lines are met with, together with solar motifs, on a vase from Tomb 5 at Los Miliares. Camon Aznar sees a representation of herds in these signs (8f&gt;). On the basis of the interpretation of similar representations placed vertically, one might perhaps think of ? pine-men ? lying down. More convincing, however, would seem to be the comparison with the closely-placed signs traced on various materials, which indicate the number of the days, the count of cattle, that of hunted animals and other lists of this kind, in the ethnological environ? ment. The linear combinations (PL III, Fig. 2, 5 and 12) which are also found at Monte Bego, and are described as network or protogeometric types of uncertain meaning (90), may also be assigned to the same group of ? structures ? or ? networks ?. Network schemes have recently been observed at Grotta Verde (Alghero) together with star-shap? ed and cruciform engravings, and, on the basis of the material found in situ, referred to the culture of S. Michele di Ozieri (Early Bronze) ("). Some geometric motifs are also present (PL 111, Fig. 4 and 10), and their inter? pretation seems difficult. For them too one can refer to prehistoric paintings. A rhomboid inscribed in a circle is in fact found at Sierra de Almaden (92), while the double oval barred horizontally recalls the figuration on the wall of the decorated tomb of Hierakonpolis, from the protodynastic period, interpreted as representing a trap (93). We have already analyzed the single elements which make up the scenes shown in PL IV; in general, they form compositions with an expressive language of their own. In Fig. 1 the scene is made up of two rivers, an animal which is fording, others near the water. There also appear two particularly stylized designs (9-shaped) thought to be human types. Perhaps the same interpretation can be applied to a ? T ?-shaped figure (") Roof-shapes similar to the Perigordian ones are also found, as property marks, on objects of the Ainu of northern Japan; the initial idea of these signs is most probably the image of the primitive hut. See L. Capitan, E. Breuil, D. Peyrony, La Caverne de Font de Gaume, cit., p. 234, Fig. 224. (88) Prehistoire, cit., p. 23, Fig. 21. (89) J. Cam?n Aznar, op. cit., p. 458. (90) C.

To these may be added still other geometric motifs (barred rectangles), and ? inscribed pine-men ?, which should probably be in? terpreted as houses seen from above or cultivated fields (94). The motif placed along the lower river-bed, with appendages at its base, might suggest the idea of a house on piles but this interpretation must be excluded because this kind of dwelling is foreign to the habitat and ethnological groups of the steppes. In Fig. 2 we again find the usual motifs; a ? &lt;p ?-shaped man, especially large, divides the composition almost in two and dominates the other elements: on the left there seems to be represented a stream which goes to irrigate a field, on the right an animal with long horns which is about to fall into a trap shown by a geometric motif ending in a triangle. Even in these figurative groups, therefore, just as in detailed schemes, the same types are repeated. Figures and scenes repeat the more significant elements of daily life which, expressed with extreme essentiality, assume from their very function a particular style. Figurations attributed to the prehistoric age have been for the moment examined, in seeking out the most likely interpretation for the designs scratched on the stucco of the caves of Haz?r Sum (designs which are therefore later than the epoch in which Buddhism was spread in Bactriana). This attribution has indeed been generally based on stylistic resemblances, since stratigraphical data were almost never available. In fact, with paint? ings and engravings on walls, even if definite material is found in the earth filling of the caverns, the deposits rarely arrive at the point of covering at least part of the drawings and rarely contain decorated fragments along with securely datable finds. Even rarer is the case in which the entrances of caves were buried shortly after the hand of man traced the signs which interest us. Then, in dealing with the ? barrancos ? of Spain and caves of little depth, their access has remained more or less unaltered, so that there is the pos? sibility of their having been visited over a long period of time. On the same rock-surface at Monte Bego, for example, one finds schematic en? gravings, chiselled carvings, Latin characters, anthropo-zoomorphic figures from historical times, and recent signatures; this is proof that the place was uninterruptedly frequent? ed, and yet, on a basis of style, the ? graffiti ? are referred to an cc archaic ? mesolithic series and the hammered engravings to a ? recent ? series (Late Bronze - Iron Age) with (94) P.

But if it be true that one notes a passage from the naturalistic to the stylized style (*6) in the mesolithic above all, and that the Copper Age marks the height of this style (97), we must take into consideration that the evaluation of an artistic phenomenon can? not be set apart from the historical understanding of the phenomenon itself. Ethnological documentation testifies that certain motifs, appearing for the first time in very remote epochs, have been traced in relatively recent times. All the designs pre? sent at Haz?r Sum, for instance, are similar to the petroglyphs of Nevada and eastern California (,s). These petroglyphs, on the basis of numerous observations, have been attributed to various periods ranging in date from 5000 B.C., to later than 1800 of our era (**). Although one cannot exclude that they may be partly the work of Sha? mans on the occasion of initiation rites for youth (10?), they are generally held to be the work of populations chiefly given to hunting, while a hieroglyphic meaning is com? pletely ruled out. The attribution to hunting peoples (101) is based on the presence of figures of antelopes, stags and mountain goats, and on the fact that these engravings are assumed to be connected with the magical ideology of the hunt; the recent signs might in this case be explained as mere imitation of old motifs. The drawings are almost always schematic or abstract ,and therefore not always understandable, even if it is dif? ficult to deny them a very precise meaning (102). The supposed human figurations appear in numerous variations: clepsydra, tree shape, cruciform, scale-shape, ? T ?, ? &lt;? ?-shape, pin-shape, etc., which find resem? blances among those present at Haz?r Sum. There are also frequent motifs of water, rayed circles, bars, traps, grills, and comb-shapes: all signs that, as we have remarked, would have been traced out in the course of about 7,000 years. Among the figurations of the descriptive kind, the schematic ones with goat-shapes, anthropomorphs, zig-zags and traps, are found also in Egypt with a certain frequency; they are thought to be the work of ? primitive hunters ? who lived in the predynastic period (103), or of cc farmers of the oases ? contemporary with them (104).

Blemyans ? who lived in the desert in the G ^co-Roman-Coptic period, are to be considered alphabetic, and among them one finds some schemes known to us (105). At Ain-Sfa in the region of Vialar schematic figures of men and animals are recent or contemporary with the ? tifinagh ? (106). In the area of Abu Sofian (107) we find engravings of ostriches, giraffes, camels, armed camel-drivers, more or less stylized human figures and purely geometrical figures, da? table to the first centuries of our era. At Qalaat el Wish (northern Kordofan) and at Selima other schematic signs should be interpreted as tribal or camel marks (108). One finds at Siaro and Daga Beid in Somalia stylized figurations similar to those il? lustrated here, carved on rocks in the open; they are considered ? a deposit of property marks ?; we are dealing, that is, with the same signs marked on the herds. Note that the mark does not refer to the owner but to the entire tribe, and that marks belong? ing to different tribes are found together (109). At Bahi, in Tanganyika, we find rock-paintings which include rayed circles, comb shaped animals and strongly stylized human figures. They were drawn in recent times by the natives on the occasion of funeral ceremonies, which also involved animal sacri? fices and offerings of beer, with a view to obtaining rainfalls (l ?). While in the Chicolone I cave of Mozambique we find parallel and comb-shaped bars attributed to the Wilton culture (epipaleolithic culture which acquired some neo? lithic elements), in the refuge of Monte Churo there are scale-forms, comb-forms and parallel bars whose exact date it is not possible to establish, since all archaeological ma? terial is lacking. As the place is frequented by natives who bring numerous offerings to the dead, we might be dealing with anything but an ancient manifestation (nl). Again in southern Africa we find zig-zag lines interpreted as rivers (Mrewa Cave), comb-shaped animals (Sibafo refuge, Matopo hills) (112), comb-shapes, grills, roof-sha? pes, scale-shapes (Nachikufu caves), (na), many highly stylized anthropomorphs (Mban gombe village) (114) and inscribed tree-shapes (Nachitalo) (115).

The peoples of the late Stone Age were the creators of the so-called c&lt; Nachiku fan ? culture, and lived on hunting and gathering. Note that there is no clear distinc? tion between the Stone and Iron cultures and that the paintings seem for the most part to go back to the last stages of Nachikufan culture (3rd period, datable from the 16th century) which presents a mixture of stone and iron materials. Tradition ascribes these paintings to the Bakafula-Batwa, semi-Bantu peoples destroyed about 150 years ago, who lived in caves and supported themselves on the products of hunting and harvests. It is an interesting fact that some motifs are still repeated, above all in charcoal, by the shepherds who take shelter from the rain in these very refuges. Stow notes a cave near the great precipice of Klein Aasvogekop which has a painted group with an elephant, symbol of rain, shown under a rainbow, accompanied by a ho? rizontal line crossed by nine bars; he gives no explanation (117)* A rocky cave near Kleene Caledon preserves cruciform signs, a rayed circle and a tree-shape, painted in red or white (**8). All these schematic paintings form part of an artistic complex in which there are plenty of scenes with men dancing, hunting and tending flocks, and fi? gures of animals ? ostriches, oxen, elephants ? in a perfectly naturalistic style. They date back only about 30 or 40 years. ? T ?-shaped signs, tree-shaped signs, barred rectangles and ovals, and rayed cir? cles, appear at Driekops Eiland, executed with the same technique of chiselled engravings. Although they do not show any compositive link, Van Riet Lowe gives these signs an ideographic value and considers them recent works, although many remains of the Wil? ton and Smithfield cultures appear on the surface (119). Let us recall in this connection Battiss' experiment; he gained the confidence of the natives of the South African bush, and invited them to draw anything they wished. The result was a series of infantile pictures of animals, trees and other symbols, such as small rods, poles and rayed circles, whose meaning he could not establish (120). There have been found in India, carved on natural stones at Mandori near Attok (121), highly schematic signs of anthropomorphs, animals and rayed circles which King links both to certain Chinese characters and to Swedish (122) and Spanish carvings from the Bronze Age. Sir J. Marshall thinks that the Indian carvings come from a recent (117) G. W. Stow, Rock Paintings in South Africa, London, 1930, PL 34. {??) Idem, PI. 67: b. ("?)

Still on the Asiatic continent, the petroglyphs of Jel?l?b?d (123) show among the pic? torial signs representations of men and cattle, but above all of ? mouflons ? (124)? Al? though some scholars recognize in them the Ovis Vignei itself, ancestor of the domestic ram, and Breuil and Przeworski (125) date them to the Copper Age, Foucher is not in? clined to think them very old. The same can be said for the figures, mostly animal, found in the pictographic inscription painted on the hill of Doda near Chargul in the district of Peshawar (126), and for the rock engravings at Ghorband and Laghman (127); as regards the latter, Foucher asks whether they might be prehistoric drawings, or vestiges of old magical rites performed by hunters, the work of shepherds, or, as seems most pro? bable, pictographic inscriptions. As Breuil stated to Foucher, schematic animal figures are found in Transjordan, Kurdistan, Armenia, Iran, Pamir, Ladakh and Tibet (128) as well. Japanese scholars have recently published (12!&gt;) drawings of goats carved on the mo? nolithic monument of Takht-i Rustam, of which we give some photographs taken on the spot (Pis. IX and X). Dated to the 5th century A.D., they are assumed by these scho? lars to be a pastime of workmen involved in the execution of the monumental work. The comparisons made by the Japanese with the rock engravings in Palestine (130) are not convincing, since the resemblances with tha Negev figurations are very slight. The goats of Style II, probably from the 4th millenium B.C., show long curved horns but also bellies in the form of a ? lazy C ?. Some isolated goats of Style IV A (131) of the 2nd millenium B.C. appear to be closer to those of Takht-i Rustam; however, such figura? tions are an exception, since this style almost always presents composite scenes of hunting, flock-tending, dancing and religious ceremonies. Fairservis (132), without giving any precise information as to the figurations, notes petroglyphs of goats, human figures and geometric motifs from Belucistan to the Hindus (area of Kunduz, pass of Shibar, valley of Ghorband, Kajakai near Kandahar, Ghazni, valley of Zhob and Sishin). Both in style and content they probably are not too far removed from those described for us by other authors, with regard to the same regions. (12S) A.

This art, chiefly due to agricultural populations (which appears completely different from that localized north of the Hindukush), represents numerous animals, among them oxen, horses, camels, ele? phants, in addition to men and women in various occupations. There appear scenes of com? bat in which individuals are shown armed with arrows, lances, and axes, and protected by shields; or else domestic activities are presented, the gathering of honey, plowing, storing water, the care of children, the use of the harp. Even in this figurative horizon the abstract symbols already described in regard to the rock of Mandori are not lacking. Scholars generally avoid giving them any precise meaning: it seems to us, on the basis of the present study, that one can recognize in them countermarks of groups given to nomadism. The figurations which are closest to the engraving of Haz?r Sum are those carved on the pedestal of the tomb of Cyrus, on the columns and other monuments of Pasargar dae in Iran (136). Few of the signs appear to be recent. It has been noted that some symbols, among the least complex, are very close indeed to the camel-marks of both Iran and Jordan (137). Another example is offered us by the very frequented locality of Jebel Anazeh (now Enaze) (138), meeting-point of Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, where the Bedouins usually carve their trial countersigns on the tombs of the dead whom they bury here, or else as simple remembrance of their passage. In Syria as well as in northern Arabia reproductions of property-marks (13*) appear carved or drawn with charcoal on rocks, walls, columns, dolmens, menhirs, isolated sto? nes, wells and tombs. Many of these signs resemble those scratched into the stucco of (133) A. Stein, An Archaeological Tour in Wazi ristan and Baluchistan, in Mem. Arch. Survey of India, 37, 1929, p. 79 and 84. (134) B.

Even the rock engravings which are found everywhere in the Arabian peninsula have been interpreted as old countersigns of pictorial origin, repre? sentations of the totem, placed originally not only on the camels but also tattooed on the members of the tribe (14?). This could be confirmed by Iranian evidences (141), since near Pusht-i-kuh 30% of the individuals observed presented marks in the form of round scars, stylized animals, etc., whose purpose was to strengthen the person tattooed or cure his illnesses. In Syria, along the Amman-Routbah-Bavhdad road, there appear numerous engra? vings. These are Saphaitic writings (lst-3rd century A.D.) whose elements are close to the tribal marks and signs in the caves of Haz?r Sum (142). In an excursus on the rock art of Central Asia and Siberia, Tallgren describes va? rious figurations belonging to different styles and periods which he divides into two main groups (143): one of ? descriptive ? signs, also called ? historical ?, the other of ? pri? mitive, schematic, magical, historical ? signs. The two groups seem to differ in their geographical range as well as origin and development. The a primitive ? figurations occupy the entire region of Upper Asia, from the Orkhon river in the east to the steppes of northern Turkestan, and from Pamir to the Siberian forests, just as Central Asia and Western Russia. A dating ranging from 2000 to 1500 B.C. is proposed for the figurations in Podolia, Crimea and the Caucasus; for the most part of those in the Central Asian steppes, however, the work of shepherds, a chronology that oscillates between 500 B.C. and 800 A.D. Deserving of particular attention is the ? Pisannaya Gora ?, the decorated mountain near the village of Sulek (144), where part of the figurations, obtained by chiselling and representing men and animals, especially stags, are attributed to the aboriginal peoples who lived in the steppes before the arrival of the Turks. Representations of moving stags, goats, camels, horses, sometimes horsemen and signs as private marks, are mentioned from northwestern Mongolia, Altai and Uryan khay (145). Wild goats, men, hands and other schematic signs have been oserved in Pamir (Lan gar Gisht on the Pan ja) (146), and on rocks near the Mana river north of Krasnoyarsk (14T), while no archaic drawing, says Tallgren, has been found in Bactriana probably because this region has not been well explored (148).

It does not seem possible to refer the figurations of Haz?r Sum back to very ancient traditions. Tallgren links the silhouettes of Central Asia to the primitive art of the Pa? leolithic Siberians (15?). Since many frequented paleolithic places in Siberia are known, in the basin of the Ob and in that of the Yenisei, as well as east of Lake Baikal, and since these places yield objects which might show connections with the Aurigna tian glyptic of Russia, Austria and France, there might result an artistic heredity con? nected with the permanence of a sub-glacial condition, and with an economy based on hunting and harvesting. The fact that Euro-Asiatic paleolithic art is naturalistic, while the silhouettes are almost always shown in a conventional manner, is explained as the result of a ? frozen Shamanism rather than of a hunter's imagination, as the paleolithic pictures are ?. Even if a nomadic existence continued in the Central Asiatic zone and was stabi? lized according to climatic conditions, and even if a naturalistic art, repeating itself, tends to ever-increasing simplification, it still seems to us very hard to accept the opinion of Tallgren. It has been observed that this is not a cultured art which presupposes a complex cultural background, but one which is born from instinctive manifestations, spontaneous and almost outside of all temporal reference, with an easily recognizable traditional substance. On the other hand, it is possible that these drawings, mostly ani? malistic, extremely simple, connected with the existence of nomadic man still given to a mixed economy of hunting, harvest-gathering and shepherding, may themselves consti? tute one of the components of the well-known art of the steppes, that general figurative tissue in which this particular stylistic form developed itself. Borovka, noting how the geometrical decoration and the bronzes with animal de? signs appear stylized in Altai in a manner more sober than elsewhere, was induced to seek in this area the origin, from a geographical and chronological point of view, of the Eurasian Animal Style (151). One cannot forget, however, that the documents of this style, made up chiefly of movable objects, assume a peculiar character because of this very fact, and as a result it is difficult to trace their origins unless through a chain of references relative to ? mobilier ? art (152). We think we can establish other points of contact for the designs of Haz?r Sum: as we have seen, ruling out any affinity to the art of the regions south of the Hindukush, (14?) J. Maringer, Gr?ber und Steindenkm?ler in der Mongolei. Zu den Funden der letzten Sven Hedin Expedition in der Inneren Mongolei, 1927-1935, in Monnmenta Serica, XIV, 1949-1955, pp. 303-339 and PI.

Apart from the resemblances already met with, drawings of camels or dromedaries are lacking in these regions, save for very rare exceptions. Considering the diffusion of this animal and its importance in the economy of this area, it seems strange indeed that while other animals of minor importance fill roles in the realm of Shamanistic beliefs (the animal which guides men, the animal ancestor, the sacrificial animal), the camel is ignored; obviously, an ancient tabu connected with it had firmly taken root in this region of the steppes. Elimination from the magical-religious domain, involved also elimination from the iconography (153). The absence of the figure of these animals had attracted our attention in studying the engravings of Haz?r Sum: this now appears to be a precise and interesting clue. It had been previously observed that the figures which more than all others show a strict resemblance to the engravings of Haz?r Sum, are those of Pasargardae in Iran, which have many designs of goats and abstract symbols, while camels are missing. In a territorial area, where sections are close together, they seem therefore to possess similar artistic expressions. Even if these analogies are not necessarily a proof of migra? tion (154), they still can supply us with some suggestions. As for the designs of Haz?r Sum, as we have said, they are sometimes found isolat? ed, sometimes in small groups, or else they form scenes which we find particularly in? teresting. The shepherds (there seems to be no doubt that the carvings are the work of nomadic pastoral tribes) describe their life and depict the elements necessary for pro? pitiating their journey or their rest. We see in fact that in both the scenes of PI. IV there are present signs of water, an indispensable element in the life of man and of the flock. The shepherd never shows himself, however, at least not in a recognizable manner. He is still present on the symbolic plane. The schematic signs are the countersigns of in? dividuals, or families, or the marks of animals with whom the keeper has come al? most to identify himself. Perhaps a religious prohibition has hindered man's desire to depict himself, or perhaps a symbol, already used for a long time, responds sufficiently to the needs of the individual in that determined society (155)- And symbols abound, in relation to the number of families and to the variations of time, even if the altera? tions only affect slight details. It has in fact been calculated that an emblem may re? main unchanged for a couple of centuries at the most; since the families increase and (lM) J. P.

(15S) From the time of the Upper Paleolithic, the hunting peoples put signs of recognition on their arms to show the ownership of these and of the animal struck down. See Th. Mainage, Les religions de la Prehistoire, VAge Paleolithique, Paris, 1921, p. 248. 203</page><page sequence="32">divide, there arises the need for other signs, often made by adding or removing some element in the original countersign (156). Only rarely in the review of prehistoric schematic representations have scholars, interested principally in stylistic problems, sought for a functional explanation. How? ever, those who have tried to insert the artistic phenomenon into the cultural and his? torical environment, have sensed that the abstract image must necessarily have held a value in its content which agreed with specific needs of the community (157). One should not forget that the symbol, generally biomorphic-abstract or geometric abstract, is the result of an extreme simplification determined also on the basis of taste and sensibility. The signs must have been drawn from a figurative repertory which was already part of the cultural patrimony, and to which they therefore remain tied in a philogenetic manner. The individual countersigns are also placed on tombs or near them, to commemorate the dead person. As observed at Jebel Anazeh, they are still used in the recent burials of nomads in Cyrenaica (1M). It is interesting to note how there exists an affinity of tribal signs with the letters of the local alphabets: in Marmarica with the ? tifinagh ? letters, in Syria with the Sa paitic and in India with Chinese ideograms. There is thus a development characterized by continuity, from figurative elements still tied to magical-religious ideologies, to useful schematic figurations such as tribal em? blems and animal-marks, down to the single signs of writing. It is not easy to date the engraved drawings of Haz?r Sum, and yet one can supply for them a terminus post quern represented by the habitations in Buddhist caves, whose length of occupancy must above all be established. Ceramics of the Preshon C (Shar-i Banu C) type have been found inside the caves, while other fragments recall the ceramics of Samarkand, B?miy?n and Faizab?d (15*). The finds, as was seen in the course of the 1962 campaign, do not only take place in the caves, but, for these types of ceramics, also over the entire surface of the ground, and they are therefore of little use in dating the functional period of the cave dwellings. Other Buddhist caves, relatively nearby, such as those of B?miy?n, would seem to have been inhabited down to the 8th century (16?), those of Foladi between the 5th and (15S) M. A. van Gennep, Les ?

It might be, as suggested by some plastic decorations, that the caves were in use when the Islamic populations of the area were using houses of crude bricks (see Part I: The Islamic Mounds}. However, if the traditional house was of brick, it is un? likely that all the caves were inhabited for the long period which lasted down to the abandonment of the urban center. It is even possible that the peoples who passed through the area used the caves as an occasional shelter, leaving the engraving on the walls. These were most certainly executed in a period of tranquillity, since there are no hints of the warlike nature which was part of the nomadic-pastoral status. It is impossible to ascribe definite geographical areas to the nomadic groups, since, if it is very easy to imagine that they became associated with other peoples on the oc? casion of raids or guerrilla warfare, moving with extreme mobility from one region to another, they put an end these relationships immediately afterwards, resuming their li? berty and their peaceful way of life (1?2). It is very unlikely, therefore, that an ethnic attribution would be ascribed to the authors of these engravings, especially if it is remembered that after the 6th century peo? ples of very varied origin entered Bactriana: Sasanians, Arabs, Turks and Mongols. Only the excavation of caves at a lower level, closed in ancient times, might even? tually reveal to us the period of the first occupation of these habitations; if the engrav? ings are also found on the stucco of the lower caves, it will then be possible to date them with fairly close approximation. The very numerous comparisons with examples of the pre- and protohistoric ages show in fact that in the case of schematic art, the stylistic element alone does not suffice for determining the chronology. Only as regards the Egyptian schematic ficurations, it is assumed that they may be compositions by ? primitive hunters ? and ((farmers of the oases?; this unique example, highly uncertain, is traced to the neolithic; while in the prehistoric and ethnological fields the drawings are always held to be the work of hunting peoples or of shepherd hunters. We thus have another confirmation that the prevalence of a determined artistic form is strictly linked to the cultural environment in which it is manifested, and that the so called phenomena of ? convergence ? are only the natural outlet for a particular human condition (l*8).
