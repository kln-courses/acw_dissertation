STYLE GUIDE FOR AUTHORS This "Style Guide for Authors" covers the format and language to use when preparing manuscripts for the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ). A different document, "Information for Contributors" (in the front of each issue and at http://www.aom. pace.edu/amj/submission.html), describes desir- able content. Look for the AMJ "Style Guide for Authors" on the Web, at http://aom.pace.edu/amjnew/styleguide. html and in issues of AMJ, where it appears when space permits. Manuscript Submission and Length Submit manuscripts electronically to the editor at amjtlee@u.washington.edu, following the "In- structions for Electronic Submission" at http:// aom.pace.edu/amj/electronic.html. Full articles should not ordinarily exceed 40 pages of double-spaced, 12-point type. Research notes should not ordinarily exceed 25 pages. Please use the 81/2 X 11 page setting and place page num- bers in the upper right corner. Publication Process AMJ is not printed directly from authors' files. Accepted manuscripts are copy-edited and re- typed. Authors review edits and proofread their work before it is published. AMfs copy editor- production manager will contact you to arrange this process after the editor's office assigns your work to an issue. Expect some time lag between acceptance and publication. If your work is accepted, please keep the editor's office (amjtlee@u.washington.edu) and the copy editor (pdoliner@twcny.rr.com) informed of job changes and long absences so that they can contact you. Front Pages Address. Under the title of your work, list au- thors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses and contact numbers. Example: AN EXCELLENT STUDY A. A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Current University School and/or Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@fam.edu Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note at the bottom of page 1, your title page. Abstract. An abstract of about 75 words and the title of the work go on page 2. Back Pages Group any references, appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. These form a hierarchy, with main headings (all capital letters; centered) first, then second-level headings (title- style-upper- and lower-case-letters; flush left), and then third-level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into para- graph) next. Use boldface for all the headings. Don't skip steps and, say, head a section with a second-level heading before you have used a first- level heading. Use second- and third-level head- ings in sets. Don't break out just one second-level subsection within a main section or just one third- level subsection within a second-level subsection. Examples: METHODS Data and Sample Measures Independent variable. Dependent variables. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number (Hy- pothesis 1) or number-letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relationship to publication. 515</page><page sequence="2">516 Academy of Management Journal August Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Authors" has a positive relationship to p ublication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key techni- cal terms. A technical term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Putting the first appearance of a word in quotation marks can replace providing a definition for technical terms that are not key to your work. Example: We noted several instances of "voluntary turnover," but these were outside the focus of this study. Abbreviations. Avoid using abbreviations for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names-not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organizations and research instruments may be abbreviated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and some databases may be abbreviated. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used a chi-square test to evaluate fit," not "We used a X2 test." Do use mathematical symbols and numbers to report illustrative results and give formulas. In both, italicize letters that are customarily italicized, such as p, r, b, F, and Z. Use boldface italic for vectors. Put spaces around equals signs. Illustrative results go in parentheses. The text introducing them should be a complete sentence. Example: One coefficient for the interaction was significant (model 3: /3 = 0.06, p &lt; .05; model 5: 3 = 1.06). Equations' presentation depends on their appear- ance and their role in your research. Generally, formulas that aren't key and equations used to es- timate regression coefficients should be run into the text. However, formulas that contain oversized symbols or division cannot be run in. These, and some one-line equations, should be displayed (centered). If you assign a number to a displayed equation, place it in parentheses, on the far right. Examples: Run-in equation-We used Craig's (1992: 20) dis- tance formula (d = xyz). Displayed equation- Y [e-xxt)h(Xyt] Pr(Y, = yx,) = Yt! ' (1) where Y, is.... Your definition of each new term in the equation follows. Sexist or biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating to ethnic or other groups. Be particularly careful in dealing with gender, where long-established customs, such as the use of "he" as a generic pronoun ("a manager ... he"), can imply gender-based discrimination. Using plural pronouns-changing "the manager ... he" to "managers ... they"- usually helps. Active voice and first person. Put sentences in the active voice ("I did it"; "They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)-Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable)-Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (less desirable)-The author devel- oped three new items. First person (more desirable)-I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Avoid describing inani- mate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological de- tails, such as explanations of the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Presenta- tion should be concise. If you can, avoid table formats and exact repro- ductions of surveys. Lists with headings are fine. Look at published AMJs for models. Label multiple appendixes "APPENDIX A," "AP- PENDIX B," and so forth. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. Label tables within appendixes "Table Al," "BI," and so forth. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text or each other. Please carefully consider what each table or figure adds to your work. Look at tables and figures in published issues of AMJ to get ideas for preferred formats. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG-</page><page sequence="3">2003 Volume 46, Number 4 517 URE" with a number ("1," "2," etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and in boldface type, but in title-style letters (upper and lower case). Number tables and figures consecutively (one se- ries for tables, one for figures). Place tables and figures at the end of the manuscript, but indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure must have a sentence in your text that introduces it. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed to achieve a neat, readable presentation. Please do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type or using abbreviations. Spell out the names of your variables. Don't use code names and abbreviations. Example: Desirable variable name-Profitability Undesirable variable name-PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Label the data across the top or down the far-left side-not in the body. The body of your table should contain only data. In general, give ages and percentages as whole numbers, and report only two decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left corners of their tables. For general footnotes to tables, use superscript small letters. A lettered footnote may be used to summarize significance levels: a All values greater than ... are significant at.... To report significance levels one-by-one, indent separate footnotes under all your other footnotes. Use asterisks. Example: *p &lt; .05 **p &lt; .01 Unless you are reporting exact probabilities, keep to two levels of significance. In all cases, use a single asterisk for the .05 level. More on figures. Figures (unlike tables) have graphics. If possible, our printer scans figures di- rectly from the hard copy of your manuscript into the publication files. So make sure your figures will print out clearly. Place all words horizontally-avoid setting words parallel to your y-axis in a graph, and avoid vertical stacks of letters. Use the same full (not abbreviated) variable names you use in the text and tables. Citations Formal citations. These are your in-text, in pa- rentheses, identifications of other research. Every work that has a citation needs to have a correspond- ing reference (see "References," below). Examples: Name and year-Several studies (Adams, 1994; Bernstein, 1988, 1992; Celias, 2000a, 2000b) sup- port this conclusion. Year only-But Van Dorn and Xavier (2001) pre- sented conflicting evidence. Order. Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. See the "name and year" example just given. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in citations. Examples: First citation-Few field studies use random assign- ment (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Horner, Hub- bard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). Subsequent citations-... even when random as- signment is not possible (Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the names.) Page numbers. To cite a direct quotation in run- ning text, give its page after the year, separated from it by a space and a colon. Example: In-text quotation-Lee has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1998: 3). No author? For an article with no author, cite the periodical as author. Example: Periodical as author-Analysts predicted an in- crease in service jobs (Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "cor- porate author" that produced them. Example: Organization as author-Analysts predict an in- crease in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1992).</page><page sequence="4">518 Academy of Management Journal August Such sources can also be identified informally. No corresponding reference will then be needed. Example: Informal citation-According to the 1999 U.S. In- dustrial Outlook, published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources. Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or cor- porate). If not, give the Web address that was your source in parentheses. No corresponding reference need be used in the latter case. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Cen- sus Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Or- der works by an identical author by year of publi- cation, listing the earliest first. If the years of pub- lication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat the author's name for each entry. Books. Follow this form: Last names, initials (separated by a space). Year. Title (Boldface italic, capitalize only the first letter of the first word and of the first word after a long dash or colon.) City where published: Name of publisher. (For small U.S. and Canadian cities, follow the name of the city with the postal abbreviation for the state or province; for small cities in other countries, give the full name of the country.)

ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT PUBLICATIONS MISSION STATEMENT The Academy of Management is committed to advancing theory, research, edu- cation, and practice in the field of management. The Academy publishes four journals, each of which broadly contributes to this objective while emphasizing a particular scholarly aspect of it. The Academy of Management Review (AMR) provides a forum to explicate theoretical insights and developments. Articles published in the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ) empirically examine theory-based knowledge. The Academy of Management Learning and Education (AMLE) provides a forum to examine learning processes and management educa- tion. Articles published in the Academy of Management Executive (AME) use research-based knowledge to inform and improve management practice. Addi- tional details about each journal's scholarly domain are included in the respective mission statements. ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL MISSION STATEMENT The mission of the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ) is to publish empirical research that tests knowledge-based claims. All empirical methods, including, but not limited to, qualitative, quantitative, field, laboratory, and combination meth- ods, are welcome. Articles published in AMJ must make strong empirical and theoretical contributions and highlight the significance of those contributions to the management field. Thus, preference is given to submissions that provide a strong theoretical framework as the foundation to empirically examine issues with high relevance for management theory and management practice.</page><page sequence="6">e Academy of Management Journal 2003, Vol. 46, No. 4, 520.

Paetzold, Texas A&amp;M University BACKGROUND Goffman originally defined stigma as a distinguishing characteristic or mark that leads to the devaluation of the individual. Goffman saw abominations of the body, blem- ishes of individual character, and tribal identities as the three categories of stigmatizing conditions. More re- cently, Jennifer Crocker and colleagues have argued that "visibility" and "controllability" are the most important dimensions of stigma, because visible and controllable stigmas are the most damaging. Stigmatization has been the subject of intensive re- search in a variety of settings by social psychologists. There has been a relative neglect, however, of stigmatiza- tion in organizational and work settings. The roles that people occupy at work, their experiences while perform- ing these roles, and the groups and organizations with which they are affiliated all serve as potentially powerful sources of stigma. Stigmas that originate outside the or- ganization intrude upon and influence what happens in- side the organization. Stigmas that originate in the work- place are important to control processes in organizations and affect other spheres of an individual's activities out- side of work. This special issue will build on the psycho- logical and sociological work on stigmas to explore the relevance of this work to individuals and groups within organizations. The expectation is that stigmatization in organizations requires a reconceptualization that incor- porates dynamics that operate beyond the level of the individual. Although not inclusive, the following set of research questions includes issues that could be addressed: * Individual-level stigma. Is stigma a property of the in- dividual in the organization, or is it constructed by the perceiver? How does an individual in an organization come to be stigmatized? How do individuals in an orga- nization overcome stigma? What goals are served by the stigmatizer? What factors affect the stigmatization pro- cess? What factors outside of the individual (organization level or group level) affect stigmatization of the individ- ual? Are there positive outcomes of stigmatization for the organization? To what extent are stigmas, or stigmatiza- tion, universal? To what extent are they culturally bound? How does stigmatization differ from deviance, prejudice, and discrimination? * Internal organizational functioning. How does the per- son-job or personorganization fit model relate to and influence stigmatization? Do performance appraisal, selection, compensation, and other HR functions lead to stigmatization? Is stigmatization on the basis of dishonest or ineffective behavior crucial to main- taining organizational control? How does stigmatiza- tion affect efforts to achieve continuous improvement in organizations? Does a strong organizational culture necessarily involve stigmatization of those who do not conform to the culture? Does diversity increase toler- ance for differences in organizations, or does it allow stigmatization to transmogrify into something else? * Group-level stigma. How does occupation tarnish or stain the individual who is a member of that occu- pational group? Which occupations are more stigma- tizing and why? How does the trend toward team management relate to and influence stigmatization? Can social group stigma be "undone" in the work- place? * Organizational-level stigma. What does it mean for an organization to be stigmatized? What are the pro- cesses by which an organization becomes stigma- tized? How can organizational reputation be stigma- tizing? How do organizations confront potentially stigmatizing events and situations? How do stigma- tized organizations engage in impression manage- ment for external and internal constituencies? How can organizations use stigmas to their advantage? What are the antecedents of organizational stigma? What are the organizational consequences of stigma- tizing events? How can organizations and their mem- bers predict, cope with, and overcome organizational stigmas? * Methods. How do we measure stigma? What are the particular concerns of multilevel approaches to the study of stigma? Does the construct have the same meaning across levels?

Theory and method provide tools for such efforts. The two are often treated as conceptually independent, but, in practice, they are highly interrelated. Few theories, if any, do not have methodological implications, nor are all methods up to the task of illustrating any theory at work. In short, the relationship between theory and method is complex-a source of considerable tension within and across organizational research communities. Such tension is not always recognized. To wit, textbook treatments of the relationship continue to suggest that methods (minimally) test the plausibility of theories and do so in a roughly predictable-if not magical-sequence. In conventional form, problems are identified, specific questions or hypotheses posed, research tactics spelled out, measures taken, and analysis conducted, and infer- ences or conclusions result. Yet practicing organizational researchers know from both experience and growing cri- tique that this conventional narrative is mis- leading. What seems clear today is that method can generate and shape theory just as theory can generate and shape method. The two are inextricably tied together, however much we may wish to pull them apart. The purpose of this special topic forum is to explore in some depth just how broadly and deeply methods are entwined with the- ory. Specifically, we invite papers that take up questions as to how method-old and new-helps to develop theory and/or how theory-old and new-helps to develop method. Micro, macro, qualitative, and quantitative ap- proaches are welcome, with overlapping and integrating approaches encouraged as well. The editorial group for this forum-Terry Mitchell (trm@u.washington.edu), Jes- per Serensen (sorensen@mit.edu), and John Van Maanen (jvm@mit.edu)-is intentionally diverse in terms of dis- ciplinary and intellectual background. Hence, we are seeking manuscripts representing a variety of perspec- tives and scholarly interests in organizational research. Below are listed a few topical areas where submissions are welcome. This list is not intended to be inclusive but merely representative of a few of the domains of interest covered by this call for papers: * how to think about and define research constructs and variables, particularly with respect to understanding complex relationships across organizational levels and time; * how to order and carry out the research process, from conception through publication, based on an explicit concern for the interaction between method and the- ory, and the implications of such processes for the training of new researchers; * how exploration and development of theory enhance or limit method choice (and the reverse); * how formal modeling and/or simulation techniques contribute to (or limit) theory development and testing; * how particular methodological strategies have im- pacted theoretical developments in particular areas of research, or how particular theories have shaped meth- odological practice; and * how inductive or deductive (single-unit or multiple- unit, statistical or representative) research strategies constrain or broaden theoretical choice and elabora- tion. In brief, there are many ways theory and method play off one another. We are seeking papers that explicitly address these matters and, in the end, offer suggestions for how organizational studies might be improved by taking into account the interaction of method and theory. SUBMISSIONS To be considered for publication in this special topic forum, manuscripts must be received by May 5, 2004. There are two ways to send the manuscript to AMR. The strongly preferred way is by e-mail attachment. To do so, simply attach a copy of the Microsoft Word file to an e-mail and send it to briefamr@tulane.edu. Alternatively, you may sub- mit your manuscript on a 3.5 floppy disk or CD by mail or express delivery. Please include with the disk a cover letter indicating your postal address, e-mail address, and tele- phone number. Details concerning AMR's procedures and evaluation criteria are printed in all issues of the journal in a section titled Information to Contributors. Instructions for manuscript preparation are provided in the Style Guide for Authors, printed in each January issue of the journal. Au- thors must consult both documents and follow them when submitting manuscripts.
