<plain_text><page sequence="1">24 Worked and utilised bone and antler: practical and cultural rationales for the selection of raw materials Valasia Isaakidou INTRODUCTION Analysis of bone and antler artefacts in the prehistoric Aegean has to date generally focused rather narrowly on typology. Recently, however, following a largely French tradition originating in lithic studies, some re- searchers have introduced the concept of the chaine operatoire (e.g. Christidou 1997; Stratouli 1997; 1998) which directs attention to the entire sequence of pro- duction, from selection of raw material through to use and discard. At one end of this sequence, there is clearly scope for microwear analyses of bone tools to get at func- tion, similar to those conducted on assemblages else- where in the world (e.g. Campana 1989; Lemoine 1989). There is, however, also potential for the application of standard iow-tech' methods of faunal analysis, particu- larly to the investigation of the selection of raw materi- als. The relevance and usefulness of such methods, which may shed light not only on bone/antler artefacts but also on the unworked component of faunal assem- blages, is explored here through an analysis of the bone artefacts from the Late Neolithic site of Makriyalos in Pieria, northern Greece. THE RELEVANCE OF ZOOARCHAEOLO- GICAL METHODS TO THE ANALYSIS OF BONE ARTEFACT ASSEMBLAGES Zooarchaeologists use a range of approaches to the in- terpretation of faunal assemblages. In addition to nu- merous studies on the economic role of animals, recent anthropological and ethnographic studies as well as zooarchaeological studies have shed light on their im- portance from a symbolic perspective (for example see papers in Ingold 1988; Morphy 1989; Thomas 1996; Willis 1993). Moreover, zooarchaeologists have devel- oped methods for unravelling pre-depositional activi- ties, such as carcass processing (e.g. Binford 1981), and post-depositional, taphonomic processes (e.g. Brain 1 981; Lyman 1994; Payne and Munson 1985). As bone and antler artefacts are routinely physically separated from the bulk of the faunal assemblage dur- ing excavation and then conceptually isolated in terms of analysis and interpretation, their study has not gen- erally profited from the application of zooarchaeological methodology. Some researchers do provide informa- tion pertaining to the taxa and elements used (e.g. Christidou 1997, 130; Stratouli 1997; 1998) but further elaboration appears to be thwarted (as observed by the researchers themselves, e.g. Christidou 1997, 131) by inadequate sample size and the absence of comparative data from analysis of the unworked faunal assemblage. These limitations may explain why, in contrast to the emphasis on procurement of raw materials in lithic and metal studies, it is often implicitly assumed that bone was readily available (Moundrea-Agrafioti 1996, 104) and that minimal planning was involved prior to the manufacture of bone artefacts. Understanding taphonomic processes may help clarify issues of choice. For example, an abundance of bone tools made from robust anatomical elements and species may be an artefact of partial preservation, rather than human choice. Once taphonomic filters, however, have been discounted, remaining patterns may be di- rectly related to human behaviour; for example, a scar- city of robust elements would favour human choice of raw materials. Such arguments would be strengthened by discrepancies in the frequency of particular taxa or skeletal elements, between worked and unworked as- semblages derived from similar or identical contexts and so subject to the same post-depositional processes. The extraction of bone for artefact manufacture should be ruled by the choices and constraints, practi- cal or cultural, which apply to the extraction of all other primary animal products. Practical constraints within which the producers of artefacts would have had to operate include the range of taxa present and the sea- sonal availability of their carcasses; these in turn partly depend upon prevailing strategies of hunting or ani- mal management. Within these constraints, choices dependent upon functional considerations would have been made. For example, natural morphological fea- tures, such as the length, straightness or robustness of particular anatomical elements of particular taxa, might lead to their preferential use. RAW MATERIAL ACQUISITION: PRACTICAL AND CULTURAL CONSTRAINTS The nature of the raw material, as well as experimental data, suggest that bone is best retrieved for working</page><page sequence="2">234 VALASIA ISAAKIDOU during carcass processing or at least soon after cooking and consumption of meat. Observations during experi- mental reproduction of bone artefacts using non-metal tool kits, suggest that bone is best worked when fresh. Fresh bone seems to be far more manageable for the production of blanks, while soaking of dry bone does not seem to be very effective (Watts 1995, 12; Wescott and Holladay 1995, 16). Exposure of bone to temperature and humidity ex- tremes and carnivore attrition renders it non-elastic and friable, through loss of its organic content, and more or less useless for working and use. Such considerations may of course not be relevant to bone used expediently, but are critical to raw material which undergoes inten- sive modification from blank extraction to the creation of the final product. Ethnographic observation points to an often intensive use of most of an animal's hard and soft tissues, including hide, meat, fat, marrow, sin- ews, etc. (Owen 1993), so that extraction of bone for manufacture would have had to fit into a quite complex chain of carcass processing events. It is most likely, therefore, that bone for artefacts would have been ex- tracted at one of two stages of carcass processing: i. for non meat-bearing bones such as metapodials and phalanges, at the skinning and dismembering stages. ii. for meat-bearing bones, either after filleting or af- ter cooking; experimental data indicate that boil- ing and stewing are two methods of cooking most likely to preserve the bone in a state suitable for further working (Watts 1995, 14). Cultural choice may be inferred, inter alia, from the differential use as raw materials of certain taxa or age/ sex groups or of certain skeletal elements, where such patterning is not explicable in terms of availability (on which the unworked faunal assemblage may be informa- tive), functional suitability for working, or taphonomic processes. Such differential use may be evident not only in the selective use or avoidance of particular taxa or elements, but also in the intensity with which these are worked or used (the latter attested by the degree of han- dling polish exhibited). If, as argued above, bone for working tended to be collected fresh during or shortly after carcass processing, the selection of raw material may have been significantly constrained by cultural rules applying to the ownership and consumption of animal primary products and, especially, meat. MAKRIYALOS: THE SITE AND THE ASSEM- BLAGE Excavation at the site of Makriyalos has revealed about 1 5% of the Late Neolithic settlement, which is estimated to cover c. 50 hectares (Besios and Pappa 1998, 13). The settlement is of the flat extensive type (Besios and Pappa X998, 15) and its occupation covers two phases span- ning the earlier part of the Late Neolithic - referred to hereafter as Phase I - and the end of the Late Neolithic, contemporary in pottery terms with Classical Dimini - referred to hereafter as Phase II (Besios and Pappa 1998, 16). Both worked and unworked bone assemblages from the site offer the opportunity for the zooarchaeologically informed approach advocated above, not only due to relatively good preservation and detailed contextual data but also due to their exceptional size. The faunal as- semblage consists of c. 33,500 Minimum Anatomical Units, MAU (for a description of the quantification method, see Halstead 1992, 32-3), while c. 900 arte- facts were made of bone and c. 200 of antler. Of this bone artefact total, c. 300 objects came from Phase I and c. 600 from Phase II. The size of the faunal assem- blage allows statistically valid observations to be made and its thorough study by Collins and Halstead (1999; Halstead and Collins 1997) allows for detailed analysis. The faunal remains were hand-collected, due to the essentially rescue character of the excavation, which must to a degree have influenced the representation of smaller species and elements. For the purpose of this paper the artefacts were treated (studied and recorded) as a faunal assemblage. Antler is not included in the relative representation of the various taxa as there is evidence that its procurement and processing need not have followed the rules and constraints applicable to bone. At least some of it was collected shed: two of the artefacts identified were made on shed bases. Most of the artefacts from both phases were recov- ered from habitation contexts, in contrast to the unworked bone, which was largely found in discard fea- tures. The fact that the excavated area of Phase I is domi- nated by discard features, whilst that of Phase II is rep- resented by a far higher proportion of habitation fea- tures, may explain the apparent paradox that fewer ar- tefacts were retrieved from Phase I contexts, although this yielded a far larger faunal assemblage (21 ,500 MAU for Phase I against 12,000 MAU for Phase II) (thanks are due to N. Krahtopoulou for pointing this out to me). Bone artefacts appear to have been discarded or lost, therefore, in habitation contexts presumably near where they were used and/or stored. The condition of the Makriyalos material The good surface condition of the objects and the low incidence of carnivore gnawing imply that bone used for artefacts had not been lying in the open, being thus subject to attack by carnivores and weathering. This is consistent with the experimental evidence discussed above, as it suggests that bone was used fresh for the manufacture of bone implements. The recovery dur- ing excavation of an artefact, comprising the unfused shaft and epiphysis of a pig tibia, supports the above argument, as the connecting tissues must have been</page><page sequence="3">WORKED AND UTILISED BONE AND ANTLER 235 present until discard, for the two parts to be found to- gether. Selection of raw materials at Makriyalos Taxa When the unworked and worked assemblages are plot- ted together (FIG. 24.1), the discrepancy between the most abundantly available animals and those used for artefact manufacture is immediately obvious. There ap- pears to be a preference for sheep and goat skeletal ele- ments as raw material for artefacts in both phases, de- spite the fact that pig bones are the most numerous in the unworked faunal assemblage. This preference for sheep and goat bones was probably due to their size, robustness and morphological characteristics. As far as robustness is concerned, pig skeletal elements may have been avoided, because pigs tend to be slaughtered at a young age (Halstead pers. comm.). Moreover, sheep and goat bones tend to be straighter and longer, while their metapodials have anatomical features that facilitate working. The metatarsals in particular have a natural groove, which facilitates the use of the 'groove and split' technique to produce blanks for a widely attested type of artefact. Objects made of cattle bones are better rep- resented in Phase I, though this may be a reflection of differential preservation. Overall, artefacts on cattle bone are mainly made from splinters and so far the impression is that some of them at least have an expe- dient character. Apart from bones of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, the unworked faunal assemblage includes skeletal ele- ments of a number of other taxa most of which are used for artefacts. Some interesting information may be gleaned by a comparison between the two assemblages. Dog bones made into artefacts are rare (3 objects from both phases). In Phase II, preservation and small size cannot account for this rarity, given that artefacts made using hare bones, which are of similar size and robust- ness and therefore subject to recovery and preservation biases comparable to dog bones, are much commoner. Use of hare bone is all the more interesting when con- trasted to the rare use of red deer skeletal elements. Although all parts of the skeleton of red deer are repre- sented in the bone assemblage, their use for artefact manufacture is very limited. If we take the recovered material (unworked and worked combined) to repre- sent carcass availability, only 0.8% of the deer available is used for artefact manufacture, compared to 6% of sheep and goats, 4% of cattle, 1.5% of pig and 12.5% of hare. This pattern is clearer in Phase II, where 274 MAU of deer were recorded but only three artefacts were identified as being made of red deer bone. The avoidance of deer is particularly striking, given that deer bones would have been very appropriate raw material in terms of their robustness and advantageous morpho- logical characteristics in the same way as sheep and goat bones. The same may be true of boar and aurochs, since no artefacts appear to have been made using bones pro- cured from these animals. This is, however, rather more difficult to establish, since the only means of differen- tiating between the domesticated and the wild forms is size, which may be masked on artefacts due to high degree of working and fragmentation.

Bar chart showing the relative abundance of taxa within the worked and unworked bone assemblages.</page><page sequence="4">236 VALASIA ISAAKIDOU Roe deer and fox are also represented in both the worked and unworked bone assemblages, albeit in num- bers too small for analysis. A single worked bear radius from Phase II however, is worthy of comment. The degree of modification is rather minimal and as the possible working end is missing, it is unclear whether this was a tool as opposed to an ornament or talisman. The butt end and shaft show intense polish, however, suggesting handling over a long period. Anatomical elements and fusion state In terms of anatomical element selection, tibiae of most animals and metatarsals of sheep and goats are most commonly used (FIG. 24.2); for all animals most long bones are used, albeit to varying degrees (FIG. 24.3). Therefore the choice of elements appears to be func- tionally driven, perhaps with a degree of opportunism, where the need for an object was urgent and the most suitable element was unavailable. This may be implied by the fact that, although metapodials are the preferred elements for the production of pointed objects, such items were occasionally made from tibiae. Similarly, spatulate objects were made of a variety of elements, although tibiae seem to have been preferred. Record- ing of the fusion state of long bones was uninforma- tive: in most cases the state of fusion is unknown be- cause the epiphysial ends were either broken or inten- tionally removed. The rationale for raw material selection Patterns, such as these evident in the choice of particu- lar taxa, and which are not satisfactorily explained by taphonomic or functional factors, may be attributable to differential status of animals (e.g. whether they were considered edible or not), different contexts of butch- ery, food preparation and consumption, or differential access to carcasses. For example, that dogs were not eaten regularly, if at all, by the inhabitants of Makriyalos, is suggested by the rarity of butchery marks on dog bones (Halstead pers. comm.). As a result, their car- casses were presumably subject to patterns of deposi- tion different to those of edible animals and perhaps not routinely available for working. It is also conceiv- able that dog bones were consciously avoided for cul- tural as well as practical reasons. The contrasting use of deer and hare bones indicates that the selection of raw material cannot be related to a simple dichotomy between wild and domestic, whether in cultural terms (Hodder 1990) or in terms of obliga- tions to share the carcass (Halstead 1999). The use of red deer antler suggests that the rarity of worked deer bone cannot be attributed to any symbolic properties of this particular species. More plausibly, the Neolithic inhabitants of Makriyalos may have treated deer and hare differently because of differences in the method and difficulty of capture and in the segment of the com- munity involved in their procurement, processing and Fig. 24.2.

Among hunter-gatherers the capture of small animals, often by trapping, falls into the realm of gathering and is undertaken primarily by women and children (Ingold 1986, 87). The presence among the archaeobotanical remains of species that were most likely gathered in the wild, attests to such activities in Neolithic Makriyalos (Valamoti 1999, 137). This raises the possibility that the capture of animals, and thus ac- cess to their bones for manufacture of artefacts, may have been gender prescribed. Alternatively, ethno- graphic studies suggest that small game are less likely to be shared (Barnard and Woodburn 1991, 17; Whitelaw 1983), whereas the time and effort expended on capture of red deer may have invested the catch with a status (cf. Hamilakis, this volume), on which success- ful hunters could capitalise by sharing with some or all members of the community (cf. Barnard and Woodburn 1 99 1, 18), a practice which would also have been im- posed by the difficulty for a single family of consuming an animal of this size, before it spoils. Red deer may have been consumed, therefore, in a public context so that bones may have been deemed inappropriate or una- vailable for working. Alternatively, ethnographic obser- vations suggest that specific types of food preparation may also be gender prescribed. Boiling and stewing, and more generally food preparation for domestic consump- tion, are tasks mainly performed by women. Men often undertake food preparation for feasts and ceremonies where a larger segment of the community than just the family will participate (Speth 2000, 102). In sum, dif- ferent methods of preparation, rules and contexts of consumption of the primary products of edible/non- edible, hunted/domestic and large/small animals may have structured the availability of raw material for work- ing. As far as bone implements made of other animals are concerned, the bear radius deserves a mention. It is likely that the object was not curated (as attested by its high polish, most probably due to handling) because of what it was made into, since minimal time and effort had been expended on its elaboration, but rather be- cause of the animal from which it came. The choice is all the more interesting given that bear bones are very rare in the faunal assemblage. Ethnographic accounts relate the symbolic importance of bears as large, fear- some, and most importantly, anthropomorphic animals in many societies (Ingold 1986, 257), while a number of Neolithic figurines from Greece appear to represent bears (cf. Toufexis, this volume). CONCLUSION In the above discussion it is argued that analysis of worked bone using standard zooarchaeological meth- Fig. 24.3.

It should be noted that the results from the present study are pre- liminary. In particular, the analysis of raw material se- lection in combination with information on spatial dis- tribution and the morphological characteristics of ob- jects, may afford further insights into the manufacture and use of this class of artefacts.
