<plain_text><page sequence="1">Writings on China. By Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Translated with an in- troduction, Notes, and Commentaries by Daniel J. Cook and Henry Rosemont, Jr. Chicago: Open Court, 1994. Pp. xvi ?+157. It is a pleasure to see this book back in circulation. Writings on China includes annotated translations of four pieces by Leibniz on China: the preface to Novissima Sinica (in the long-familiar translation by Donald F. Lach, revised for this volume); "On the Civil Cult of Confucius"; "Re- marks on Chinese Rites and Religion"; and the longest and most com- plex essay in the set, the 1716 letter to Nicolas de Remond known as "Discourse on the Natural Theology of the Chinese." The "Discourse" given here is substantially identical to the edition published in 1977 by the University of Hawai'i Press. The study of the early China missions owes Lach, Cook, and Rosemont a great debt. But precisely because they have done the work of pioneers, it is for us who come after to look all the more carefully at this reprinting. What, according to this book's pre- sentation, do Leibniz' China writings have to teach us? Are the anno- Reviewed by Haun Saussy Stanford University 0? 1997 by University of Hawai'i Press 263</page><page sequence="2">tations and translations trustworthy and adequate? And (invoking the reviewer's privilege) can one suggest a better context and mode of presentation for Leibniz' project than this book supplies? At first glance, Leibniz' China writings look like a long bet. His en- counter with Chinese thought was mediated through the most unlikely channels: knowing no Chinese and having at his disposal neither dic- tionaries, grammars, nor native speakers, Leibniz had the nerve (as we might say today) to draw from letters, missionary reports, and preliminary Latin paraphrases of such basic works as the Lun yu and the Zhong yong a picture of essential Confucian doctrine-if not as it was taught by his contemporaries, then as it must have been taught in the purity of the earliest schools. Leibniz' project is so shocking to our present methodo- logical consciences that we must, in order to approach it, seal it off from China (the 'real' China) and think of it as a piece of European intellectual history. As the editors put it, "The Chinese writings of Leibniz should ... be read by all students of his work because of what he said in them. And they deserve a wider audience as well because they represent the sus- tained efforts of a gifted man to bring about universal harmony between the varied peoples of this earth" (p. 10, italics mine). In other words, the book's claim on the public's attention rests principally on its author and the intentions animating him. Such reticence is understandable, but unfortunate. For surely no Eu- ropean philosopher of comparable learning, gifts, and ambition had ever tried harder to bring Chinese thought into his range or written about it more passionately. And the worst of it is that Leibniz' writings on China succeed where well-intentioned ecumenical dialogues tend to go wrong. Despite the absence of adequate documentation, historical perspective, live Chinese discussion partners, and a pretense of disinterestedness, Leibniz inflicts on the European soliloquy some of the disturbance that a dialogue with strangers is bound to cause. First, a word of background. The four pieces printed here are all polemics (highly irenic ones but polemics nonetheless) composed to shore up the Jesuit side in the Vatican controversy over Chinese rites in the years around 1700. Matteo Ricci, the founder of the Catholic mission to China, had tried to present his doctrine as a complement to the Neo- Confucian philosophy current among the exam-taking classes of the later Ming dynasty. Lacking a ready-made language in which to clothe Chris- tian theology (and the Aristotelian categories through which the neces- sity of this theology was to be shown), Ricci took over terms from the Confucian classics as these were interpreted by the Song lixue philos- ophers-a strategy that indeed made him welcome, though partly as an exotic curiosity, among the scholars of Peking. Having been taught to see Christianity as an extension of things they already knew and be- lieved, Ricci's Chinese converts continued to make offerings to their an- Philosophy East &amp; West 264</page><page sequence="3">cestors and bow before the tablet of Confucius. But these concessions to local custom struck some of Ricci's successors and rivals in the China mission as unpardonable adulterations. One Jesuit who took this stand was Niccolb Longobardi, who wrote a tractate to contend that since Chinese thought was materialist and atheist to the core, no term in Chi- nese could possibly serve in a proper Christian theology. Longobardi's essay is the most detailed of several such polemics, and Leibniz quite rightly chose to argue principally against it in writing his "Discourse." The positions marked out by Ricci and Longobardi are, conspicu- ously, positions on the possibility of translation. Ricci accepted the workability of practical equivalences in word and deed, but for Lon- gobardi no Christian was a Christian who used a term that might have a subjacent pagan meaning. Leibniz, showing his training as a lawyer and diplomat, uses Longobardi's evidence to prove Ricci's point: that, when rightly interpreted (and concocting the right interpretations is the main business of Leibniz' "Discourse"), traditional Chinese doctrine contains nothing that is directly incompatible with Christian teaching. The habitual reading of Leibniz' letter takes it to be a brief for the enlargement of Christianity, and so it chiefly notices the infringe- ments Leibniz makes on Chinese philosophy-tendentious assimilations, "charitable" readings of dogmas otherwise plainly irreducible to West- ern presuppositions, and the repeated argument that whatever in China contradicts the higher truth must be a later accretion of superstitious ages. Such a reading, while pertinent, fails to observe how many con- cessions Leibniz wrings from the Catholic side. Leibniz reads the Chris- tian doctrines as a mythology also in need of purification. Such is the logic of translation, and it will be examined more minutely below; but for the moment let it be said that Leibniz lets it do its work in both directions. A book with so much to say on the possibility, the history, and the risks of translation ought to be a carefully prepared test case. Alas, it is not. The translations are readable, but often inaccurate, and lack the nimble vigor of Leibniz' original Latin and French. Where the English is muddled, the reason is usually a departure from the clearer original. A few examples will show how easily things might have been put right, especially considering that this is the third printing of Cook and Rose- mont's "Discourse." Seeking a definition of the term Ii (order, reason, pattern), Leibniz quotes from certain Chinese philosophers who say ... that the Li is the law which governs, and the intelligence which guides things; that it is, however, not itself intelligent, but through natural force, its operations are so well regulated and sure, that one could say that it is intelligent. In our way of speaking, where one must seek and deliberate in order to act properly, we would say that the Li is more than intelligent; whereas for the Chinese it is infallible by its very nature. (p. 91) Book Reviews 265</page><page sequence="4">It seems that what is at stake is a definition of "intelligence," and that the Western definition, involving deliberation, is incompatible with the Chinese definition. How did Leibniz come by his information on Chinese psychology? But there is no such suggestion in the original: C'est ainsi que j'entends les Chinois, qui disent ... que le Li est la Loi qui dirige, et I'intelligence qui conduit les choses; qu'elle n'est pourtant pas intelligente, mais, par une force naturelle, elle a ses operations si bien reglees et si sures que vous diriez qu'elle I'est. C'est etre plus qu'intelligent, a prendre le terme a notre maniere, o0i il faut chercher et deliberer pour bien faire, au lieu que le premier principe est immanquable par sa nature.' (This is how I understand the Chinese, when they say that the Li is the Law which directs and the Intelligence which conducts things; that the Li is none- theless not intelligent, but, through a natural force, the operations of Li are so well regulated and so sure that you would take the Li to be an intelligent being. That is to be more than "intelligent"-taking the term "intelligence" in our [human] manner, where [it implies that] one must query and deliberate in order to do what is right; but [the point is that] the first principle, by its very nature, can never go wrong.) The relevant contrast here is not between "us" and "the Chinese," but rather between all of us humans (with our idea of intelligence) and Nature, or God, or better yet the impersonal Li, which acts without hav- ing to learn, doubt, or think. The French sentence is admittedly a bit long, and for smoothness the corrected English translation includes a few transitional words, but there is really no justification for misinterpreting its meaning since, only a few lines above this passage, Leibniz has al- ready used the argument that what Chinese thinkers may find hardest to swallow in European teaching is its insistent anthropomorphizing. (On that score, one will find the Incarnation utterly absent from Leibniz' profile of a new cosmopolitan Christianity.) The translation makes Leib- niz seem to be pointing out a difference between cultures, when he is really announcing the secondary importance of cultural and lexical dif- ferences in light of the primary difference between human and divine understanding. Leibniz' argument may seem exotic to us nowadays, and a strange starting point for cultural relativism, but that only makes it more precious and worth calling to the attention of modern readers. At other points, too, it seems that the translators have forgotten what Leibniz was doing. They scold him, for example, for proving "logically but worthlessly" that since the early Chinese texts do not say anything about prime matter, they therefore do not say anything about prime matter that is contrary to Christian belief (p. 37). But Leibniz was pre- senting a defense, and a defense lawyer does not have to prove that an action was commanded by the law, only that it was not in contradiction with the law. Another problem with the larger argument refers again to the "anthropomorphism" idea. After inventorying several predicates of Philosophy East &amp; West 266</page><page sequence="5">the Li, the authors' Leibniz says, rather like a schoolmaster: "All these expressions of the Chinese have a rational meaning." But in the origi- nal-"Toutes ces expressions des Chinois regoivent un bon sens"-they receive a good meaning; that is, the interpreter finds them suitable to his case. The passage continues, in Cook and Rosemont's translation: "But one could grant yet a better meaning to their words, explaining them more fittingly: namely, that supreme Reason has been brought to that which is the most rational" (p. 93). More faithfully and more intelligibly, it might have been translated: "But one can give an even better meaning to their words, by explaining them as [referring to the principle of] con- venientia [or suitability], which disposed the supreme Reason [to choose] that which is most reasonable" ("Mais on peut pourtant donner encore un meilleur sens a leurs paroles, en les expliquant de la convenance, laquelle a port6 la supreme Raison a ce qui est le plus raisonnable").2 The translators' Leibniz is not a very able expositor, since Reason that can be "brought to that which is most rational" is apparently not its own master and thus a bad candidate for the role of God or Li, whereas Leibniz' own Leibniz at least honors the principle of always choosing the best of all possible worlds, that is, the world logically consistent with the greatest number of good possible and future worlds. In such cases the answer to the troublesome sentences lay just a few lines away, if the translators had taken the time to look for the leading strands of the argu- ment; but since they have not done so, it is to be feared that readers will be unable to recover Leibniz' design. In the preface to Novissima Sinica, Leibniz recounts the story of the Jesuits invited to serve the Kangxi emperor as tutors and advisors. Up until that time, the Chinese authorities had tolerated Christianity (or not tolerated it) as a fairly harmless but irregular religious sect. "But the em- peror consulted the 'will of heaven,' and ... the muse Urania designed to move the kingly mind so that our holy and truly celestial doctrine might be permitted" (p. 53). A footnote informs us that "Leibniz uses the Latin materialis coeli here. The Chinese expression is Tian ming." But the Will or Mandate of Heaven was far from the emperor's thoughts; and not even Leibniz with all his lawyer's skill could wrest an intelligent heaven from the "material sky" of which the Latin speaks. Christianity was in principle forbidden, but the emperor, under the guidance of his Euro- pean teachers, fecit materialis coeli studium, "undertook the study of the material sky," that is, of European astronomy, and thereupon, impressed by the scientific knowledge of these men from afar, decided to grant them license to reside peacefully in his empire. The role of scientific knowledge in the Jesuits' special relationship with the Manchu sover- eigns is well known by now; there is no need to go looking for provi- dential inspiration here, even if it comes in the shape of Zhou-dynasty political theology. Book Reviews 267</page><page sequence="6">Many more such examples can be found. Readers of this book can be forgiven for finding Leibniz obscure and stubborn (which he was not). The English of the translations is marred by carelessness ("principle" for "principal" on pp. 88 and 114; "inadvertantly," p. 97; the opinions of the Chinese are said to be "ambivalent" where the original has flot- tantes, "floating, variable"; and Leibniz writes to a friend that he has "taken the pleasure of looking through the books you sent me," pp. 75- 76). Expert help might usefully have been sought when, for example, a footnote to "Remarks on Chinese Rites and Religion" points out that "For some reason, Leibniz uses the Greek tou as the definite article here" (p. 70). Readers of Latin logic texts (and grammarians, too) will know the reason. There is no definite article in Latin, and when one wants to sub- ject an indeclinable foreign word like Li to flexion, one has to add a case and number marker; hence t6 Li, toO Li, and so forth. "Contingency" is a poor translation for hasard (p. 93), especially in light of Leibniz' famous arguments about necessary and contingent truths.3 And so forth; on pages 110-112, I encountered twenty-one separate errors of tense, voice, syntax, or word meaning. Even if all these were minor errors-and some were not-the accumulation of them is sure to clog the transmis- sion of Leibniz' ideas. Imperfections such as these are impossible to overlook now that the field of Leibniz-and-China studies enjoys work as carefully prepared, as exhaustively researched, and as philosophically suggestive as that of Rita Widmaier, Christiane Fremont, and Claudia von Collani.4 In English, the work of David Mungello is widely available.5 Working primarily from the vast Leibniz correspondence, these scholars have not only plumbed the archives, they have looked for the reasons behind the facts, and shown how many and various threads link Leibniz' interest in China with his other concerns.6 They also have shown that the debate on Chinese thought of which Leibniz' "Discourse" is the most visible monument is not primarily about Leibniz, but should rather be understood as a vast collective (though hardly collaborative) enterprise conducted in and around the governments, churches, and libraries of Asia and Europe. Indeed, the scrupulously researched publications of the four scholars just mentioned suggest the ideal form that this book should have taken, and will have to take for the full import of Leibniz' writings on China to become plain. Ludwig Dutens, the editor of the 1768 edition of Leibniz' works, realized that the "Letter" simply would not make sense to Euro- pean readers unless it was given some background, and so he reprinted alongside the "Letter" the whole of Longobardi's "Treatise" (with Leib- niz' marginal annotations in footnotes), letters between Leibniz and the Jesuits Charles Le Gobien and Joachim Bouvet, and excerpts from the correspondence between Father Veyssibre La Croze and Sebastian Kort- holt. We can now improve on Dutens: what follows is a do-it-yourself ZoV Philosophy East &amp; West 268</page><page sequence="7">kit to supplement Cook and Rosemont's book. Widmaier's volume greatly extends our knowledge of Leibniz' China connections and curiosities, and von Collani's gives us a better-rounded view of Bouvet's interests than was possible so long as we saw Bouvet only as the author of letters to Leibniz. Mungello (occasionally cited in the work under review) is useful on the cultural background. An adequate edition of Leibniz' "Discourse" would include all this material and more, or at least cross- reference and discuss it. Its presentation of Longobardi's treatise would consider the use Longobardi makes of its principal Chinese source, the Xingli daquan of Hu Guang (1370-1418): what do his citations reveal about the sinological and philosophical competence of the Jesuits, and how remarkable (or eccentric) did the Jesuits' readings appear to Chinese scholars in the late Ming and early Qing, a time notable for remarkable and eccentric "native" scholarship as well? To ask such questions is to invite the piercing of the wall that has grown up between those who study China, the thing-in-itself, and those who study its "image," "influence," or "impact": it is time to entertain a less stiffly dualistic epistemology. As far apart and as formidably complex as the two civilizations were, they did communicate. The fact that the pipeline through which they communicated was so small provides the historian an otherwise unattainable focus: one can observe the work of translation going forward almost word by word. Critical comments on translation are few and thin in this book. In interpreting Chinese texts, sometimes Leibniz and the accommodationist fathers "get it right," that is, they use a French or Latin term similar to what has been ratified by subsequent translators' usage; and sometimes they "get it wrong," at which point the critic may allege ignorance, bias, or hidden motive (e.g., pp. 68, 90, 113). Rather than rest content with such bare remarks, the ideal edition would attempt to discern the con- sistency of the tradition founded by Ricci and carried on by Bouvet and others (and generously fed to Leibniz by his interlocutors Le Gobien and Fontaney), for the Jesuit translators wrote within that community rather than those we know as "China" and "Europe." It should be possible to learn more about the practices of that unusual bilingual society. Bouvet often spoke of his plan of writing a "Hieroglyphic Dictionary" and a commentary on all the Chinese canonical books.7 Does anything survive of this work other than precis enclosed in Bouvet's many letters seeking support?8 Did it build on a "house commentary" of the Classics de- scending from Ricci's generation, as Bouvet sometimes suggests it did? Once the community within which the translators worked is somewhat better known, we can judge their translations (and the effects of their translations) more equably. In a word, just as gathering and interpreting information about China was too big a task for any one person in Leibniz' day, so the inter- Book Reviews 269</page><page sequence="8">pretation of the interpretations deserves to cast a broader net and not restrict itself to the single work, author, thesis, or school. Even on its modest scale, Dutens' "casebook" helps to show what Leibniz learned from Chinese philosophy; and that is more important than what Leibniz said about Chinese philosophy. Here is one example, and may it en- courage scholars to look for more: Leibniz annotated Longobardi's anti- accommodationist tract with the tenacity of a defense lawyer looking for holes in the prosecution's case, and frequently the opportunity to defend the admissibility of Chinese concepts came in the shape of terms with more than one meaning. For example, when Confucius, asked what the spirits were made of, responded (according to Longobardi) "air," Leibniz is quick to note that the Greek word pneuma, "spirit" (as in the name of the Holy Ghost, hagion pneuma), also signifies air.9 If one is going to call Confucius a materialist on that basis, then John 20:21 is a materialist document, too-a possibility worth investigating. And that is precisely the problem with Longobardi's understanding of Christian doctrine, as Longobardi might have learned from the man he calls "le Docteur Cheu-Mokien Mandarin du Tribunal des Rites." Cheu- Mokien one day asked the Jesuits what they meant by their expression "Lord of Heaven." "We answered," says Longobardi, "that we under- stood by that name a living, intelligent substance, without beginning or end, the creator of all things, and which governed all things from heaven just as the king governs all his kingdom from his palace. But he laughed at us and said that we spoke in most crude metaphorical terms, because the Lord of Heaven was not really like a living man sitting in the sky, but was rather the virtue which dominates all things...." To the Mandarin's objection Leibniz added: "Crude comparison indeed."10 Here we see dialogue happening. Despite Longobardi's intention to bring on the Chinese Mandarin merely as an example of the impiety of his whole nation, Leibniz recognizes in the Mandarin's scoffing the as- cetic discipline that translation necessarily brings to language, and uses the same critique to show that Longobardi's case against the Chinese rests on the supposition that the words used by both the Chinese sages and the Catholic catechist completely, exclusively, and adequately ex- press their meaning-a supposition from which translation comes to save us. In this case, it was to Leibniz' credit to side with the Mandarin; and in the six or seven places in the "Discourse" where Leibniz argues from metaphorical ambiguity, one should hear him as speaking Chinese." Cook and Rosemont have produced a useful book, but it could have been a better one. The strictures mentioned above are offered in a spirit of gratitude for the good work they have done and disappointment at the moments where the execution failed to match the generous intention. Ours is no longer the age of the pioneers. Philosophy East &amp; West 270</page><page sequence="9">Notes 1 - Leibniz, "Lettre ... sur la philosophie chinoise," in Ludwig Dutens, ed., G. G.
