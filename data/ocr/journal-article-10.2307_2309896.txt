<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MARCH MEETING OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SECTION The thirty-ninth regular meeting of the Southern California Section of the Mathe- matical Associationof America was held at the University of Redlands, Redlands, Cali- fornia, on March 14, 1959. Professor P. J. Kelly, Chairman of the Section, presided. The registered attendance was 132, including 96 members of the Association. At the business meeting Professor R. A. Dean, Chairman of the Nominating Com- mittee, reported that the following officers were elected by mail ballot for the next academic year' Chairman, Professor D. H. Hyers .... University of Southern California; Vice-Chairman, Professor R. C. James, Harvey Mudd College; Secretary-Treasurer, Mr. R. B. Herrera, Los Angeles City College. The Nominating Committee appointed the following members to the Program Committee forthe coming year: Professor Tom Apostol (Chairman), California Institute of Technology; Professor C. V. Holmes, San Diego State College; Professor P. J. Kelly, University of California, Santa Barbara; Mr. Fred Marer, Los Angeles City College; Dr. R. W. Rector, Ramo-Wooldridge Corpo- ration. In regard to contests, the following motion was adopted at the business meeting: "The national office is hereby requested to conduct the national contest in the Southern California Section, starting in 1960, in those cities and rural areas in which local contests are not operating. A list of such areas will be furnished to the national office by the Section." (There are at least five major contests in areas of the Section at present.) The following program was presented' 1. Man versus machines, by Dr. E. M. McCormick, Naval Ordnance Laboratory, Corona, California, introduced by the Secretary. The relationships between mathematicians and automatic digital computers were considered. The ejnphasis was on the fact that these computers were developed originally as strictly mathe- matical tools, but they are now being used by a number of other disciplines. This has resulted in applications to translation of languages, retrieval of information, abstracting of articles, and other interesting fields. Anthropomorphic designations for computers and some of their functions were also considered. 2. The geometry of numbers, by Professor Kenneth Rogers, University of California, Los Angeles, introduced by the Secretary. Minkowski's theorem on linear forms asserts that if we have n linear forms of determinant</page><page sequence="2">626 THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA [September one, then integer values not all zero can be found for the variables so as to male all the forms less than or equal to one in absolute value. It was proved by Hajos, that if the forms cannot all be made less than one then they are equivalent to a set whose matrix has ones down the diagonal and zeros above it. A new method for trying to prove Hajos' theorem was indicated. 3. Decomposition-one-hour invited address-by Professor Hans Zassenhaus, McGill University and California Institute of Technology. The forms under which the Clavius postulate, that the whole is equal to the sum of its parts, appear in various mathematical fields, were traced. 4. Auditory images of non-accelerated sources of sound, by Professor Hugh Hamilton, Pomona College. When an airplane traveling in a straight line at constant speed occupies any position P it reports itself to the ears of an observer on the ground at 0 (if at all) as being at some earlier po- sition I (or two such positions, h1 and 12). Angular relationships at 0 between P and I (or I1 and 12) are developed, among them this: at supersonic speeds (when there is for a while no "I" but ultimately both "II" and "12") the average of the angular positions of I, and 12 at 0 is always 900 behind the angular position of P at 0. The techniques used are exclusively those of tenth grade geometry. 5. Professor Begle's School Mathematics Study Group, by Mr. L. C. Lay, Pasadena City College, and Mr. William Wooton, Pierce Jr. College, Los Angeles. The scope of the School Mathematics Study Group and its objectives for the improvement of the teaching of mathematics in the secondary schools were presented. The progress of the Mono- graph Project of this group was reported, and mention was made of the plans for improving the training of mathematics teachers. The experimental textbooks, which they are writing for grades seven through twelve, were discussed. 6. A stability theorem for non-linear ordinary differential equations, by Professor H. A. Antosiewicz, University of Southern California. The title refers to a theorem, essentially due to Malkin, on the uniform-total stability of the solution y(t) _0 of a vector differential equation (1) y'=f(t, y) with f(t, 0) -O. It states that if f(t, y) is Lipschitzian in y then uniform-asymptotic stability of y(t)O 0 implies uniform-total sta- bility; and if f(t, y) is linear in y then exponential-asymptotic stability of y(t) -0 is equivalent to uniform-total stability. The importance of this theorem was discussed for problems in which the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of an equation (2) x'=f(t, x) +g(t, x) with g(t, x) small, in some sense, for large t, was studied by comparing the solutions of (2) with those of (1).
