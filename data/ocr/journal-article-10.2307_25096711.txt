<plain_text><page sequence="1">EQUESTRIAN CULTURE IN FRANCE FROM THE SIXTEENTH TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY* Thirty years ago, at the outset of her striking talk on the history of the horse, given as the Stenton Lecture at the University of Reading, Joan Thirsk cited Montaigne. In her lecture, which was devoted to the study of England rather than France, she argued that the three forces listed in her subtitle ? namely, ser vice, pleasure and power ? were at work in the early modern period, justifying the study of a topic only rarely examined on either side of the English Channel. First, there was the need throughout society for the performance of numerous horse related services; second, there was the pleasure produced by activities such as hunting, dressage, the schooling of horses and (slightly later) horse racing; and third, there was the way that power was expressed in war. The place of the horse in the English economy, in social and political life, in learned and agro nomic discussions, and as an object of both aesthetic and utilitar ian concern was such that foreign observers regarded Tudor and Stuart England as the kingdom ofthe horse.1 Historians of France do not as yet have such a stimulating over view on the early modern period to encourage them to work on a subject which highlights what was different about and specific to traditional societies. The unusual trajectory of English history also makes comparison with France and the rest of Europe par ticularly pertinent. Reopening the file thus needs no apology. No subject is too trivial to help historians to understand another cul ture. The history of men and horses helps us to explore a particu lar vision of the world through its social practices, conflicts and representations, and also through interweaving the understand ing of material things with the materialization of ideas. It seems important to extend the study of this equestrian culture further than Thirsk did and bring it closer to the contem porary era.

Just as ideologies of progress came on-stream, the horse entered on a trajectory which has continued down to our own day.2 Society today engenders different kinds of debates and new practices. The agricultural revolution of the twentieth century which finally drove the sons and daughters of French peasants into towns also stimulated a new relationship with nature and a new sensitivity to the environment. The rise of leisure time spent between freedom and consumption has also changed the nature and relationships of work. Traditional eques trian culture was tied to the land and to the behaviour of spe cialists in horses. This has given way to a range of new, often sentimental and hedonistic forms of behaviour. Professional groupings still in thrall to tradition contrast with individualistic user-groups who either place the horse alongside other domestic animals within the sphere of leisure, or else convert the horse into an object of spectacle by showing it off in the most diverse set tings, from the (revived) rural show to the celebration of Olympic horsemanship. This transformation of interest in recent times ? which has seen the first cloned ponies ? should appeal to histor ians, for it can help us to understand how a certain sensibility towards the horse has been made and then unmade over time ? extending from a kind of domination over the horse down to present-day hippophilia, and from a post-Enlightenment confi dence in mastery over nature down to the questioning of this relationship in our own day.3 For a long time, moreover, the status ofthe horse stimulated strong feelings because it endorsed the identity of socially dominant groups and symbolized wealth and power, and also owing to the horse's place at the heart of rituals of social differentiation. All this made it the focus of inter ests both intellectual and affective, both passionate and partisan. In the long, absorbing and capricious relationship between men and horses, which began millennia ago, the relatively brief period from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century which is the subject ofthe present article has a special place, for it witnessed 2 Jean-Pierre Digard, Une histoire du cheval: art, techniques, societe (Paris and Aries, 2004), 9-11, 195-200. 3 Keith Thomas, Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England, 1500-1800 (London, 1983).</page><page sequence="3">EQUESTRIAN CULTURE IN FRANCE 115 most of the changes by which horses, and the uses to which they were put, were fundamentally transformed. The accelerating cir culation of men and ideas in the period, as well as the role of invention and of technical and cultural change, were connected to numerous modifications relating to the horse. Grasping the features of equestrian culture ? which we may define as the fully interactive and highly distinctive linkage between men and horses ? will thus allow us to understand the broadest inflections ofthe social world. We must now consider the principles which guide this research into equestrian culture and the means which allow it, not unprob lematically, to be carried out. I QUESTIONS AND SOURCES The modern history ofthe European horse, from the turn ofthe sixteenth century to the end ofthe nineteenth, needs to be viewed in the very longue duree, covering the horse's initial domestication through to a period in which its uses were questioned. Such a perspective is crucial since the animal itself changed considerably over the period and this affected its place in different societies. In those societies, as in the Asian steppes, which, following Clausewitz, we might call 'horse cultures', there is no real hier archy: the horse is everywhere and available to all individuals. In others ? chivalrous, knightly or gentry societies, as in the West since the twelfth and thirteenth centuries ? the use of the horse and a whole set of symbolic identifications follows the social hier archy, from the nobility down to the popular classes.4 The early modern period inherited long-lasting relationships and represen tations, and adapted already well-established social practices and forms of behaviour. Consequently, broad limiting dates can be neither totally fixed nor completely impermeable. Witness the equestrian statues imitating those of Antiquity in our museums and on our public squares, or the ancient treatises on horseman ship derived from Greece, Rome and the Orient. The almost unchangeable prevalence of certain established technical gestures and of permanently assumed social positions 4 John Langdon, Horses, Oxen and Technological Innovation: The Use of Draught Animals in English Farming from 1066-1500 (Cambridge, 1986); Digard, Une histoire du cheval, 8-10.

Chronological boundaries are porous, and may be transcended by factors embedded in different timescales and geographical origins. Thus the encounter between the equestrian cultures of the East and West in the sixteenth century was played out in different ways in different countries ? Italy, Spain, the frontiers of the Empire, for example, as opposed to England, France and Flanders. This brings us up against problems of cultural and technical transfer and crossover influences5 of the sort which more usually characterize science, literature and material culture. The history ofthe horse touches on all that, and much more. That said, our analytical framework is delimited by two breaks with the past. The first is around 1500, within a Renaissance whose development varied in different regions. At this time, a number of decisive phenomena, interlinked in ways which varied in form and meaning, transformed existing equestrian culture. The best-known and most widely cited is the end of medieval cavalry. This military rupture, whose consequences had long been anticipated, was in fact very drawn-out. During the 'Military Revolution' of the seventeenth century6 there was still much debate on the role of heavy cavalry, while in 1905 the French government actually reimposed the use of the lance on its light cavalry, dragoons, hussars and chasseurs! A chivalric ideal which had a direct bearing on individual behav iour lasted longer as a model of heroism and virtue than it did in the military art. The tender horses of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso were equally attractive for Voltaire and for Stendhal, keen aficio nados ofthe mythologized chivalric adventures recounted by the great Italian classical poets. At the beginning ofthe nineteenth century Clausewitz advised military strategists and tacticians to change their views in a significant way: in his view, medieval cav alry was less important for its force and numbers than symbol ically, and change needed to be understood in terms of systems 5 Caroline Hodak, 'Du theatre equestre au cirque: commercialisation des loisirs, diffusion des savoirs et theatralisation de l'histoire en France et en Angleterre, 1760-1860', 2 vols.

The legendary image ofthe charge of Polish lancers on German tanks in 1939 is quite unforgettable (even though it was in fact a cinematographi cal reconstitution ofthe event made for propaganda purposes).8 It highlighted to the wider world the horse against the machine, and the futile but stirringly courageous elan of the cavalier. A further well-known change ? equally long and various in its impact ? was also at work from the late fifteenth to the early six teenth century: namely, the cultural shock produced by the 'dis covery' of Italy. In conjunction with military campaigning in the peninsula, this brought about a generalized rebirth of horseman ship, from France and England to the Holy Roman Empire and the northern kingdoms.9 Combined with the 'Military Revolu tion', the development of firearms, and the emergence of court society as described by Castiglione, the goals and manners ofthe ruling classes changed.10 Young nobles throughout Europe were attracted to the arts of horsemanship. The kind of geographical mobility that we glimpse in Montaigne's Journal, and which was facilitated by agricultural progress, population expansion and the growth of towns in the 'beau seizieme siecle', contributed more than battles to the transfer of expertise and manners.11 Urban de mand and commercial, military and rural needs also stimulated ? in Thirsk's terms ? both 'pleasure' and 'power'. Conversely, French and English farming were immediate beneficiaries of the 7 Carl von Clausewitz, De la guerre, French trans.

The mud and massacres of the trenches seemed to spell the end of cavalry, even though the latter survived and the military horse only disappeared com pletely in 1940-4. The Russian plains saw the realities of an earl ier age being tragically replayed, with winter, the Cossacks and indeed the Tatars intervening in a way which underlined the end of a certain world. Other actors henceforth took the leading roles in the military sphere. The change owed most to technological and economic upheavals in the period from 1850 to 1900 ? though it would be wrong to think that this mutation was instant aneous, for even with the arrival of railways the world of transport still had a place for the horse.14 The nineteenth century witnessed a massive increase in energy requirements, and there was abso lutely no need to shed at a stroke the calorific inputs ofthe good old horse. It was the internal-combustion engine and the car in the first decade of the twentieth century rather than the steam engine which produced the decisive blow (though even in 1900 it has been calculated that carriage horses still provided two-thirds ofthe city of New York's energy requirements!).x 5 In addition, it is important to understand not only the damage caused by compe tition at this turning point in the history ofthe horse but also the emerging principles of a new alliance. The American West was conquered by the European horse ? just as the equestrian arts of old Europe seduced the social elite of the leisure class described 12 Nicholas Russell, Like Engend'ring Like: Heredity and Animal Breeding in Early Modern England (Cambridge, 1986); Andre J.

We can say with some certainty that horses changed more rad ically during the two hundred years between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries than they had done in the previous five thousand years, back to the era of their first domestication. Horse size and weight today are in a different league from those ofthe average horse of earlier ages. Their appearance has become fundamentally both diversified and standardized. Even when tamed, the nomadic horse of a much earlier age retained features and ways which were ineffaceable ? an instinct for self-defence, for example, a gregarious character inherited from the times when packs were dominated by vigilant mares, the customs of a fragile herbivore, a matchless teachability. Though known to anthropologists and zoologists,17 these facts do not appear in recent historical accounts. Yet they provide the basic framework for a relationship which rests on two different timescales ? for human time differs from horses' time. A single horse generation is about ten years, a human generation about thirty. Thus we can say that after five hundred horse generations of stability, the morphological character of the horse and its uses have been changing in ever-accelerating ways for around fifty generations. In the ten horse generations of the twentieth century, moreover, decisive changes have come about through human intervention in the form of the generalization and steady implementation of practices and ideas formulated in the early modern period in agronomic tomes and in equestrian manuals, and diffused in studs and stables. Today, experts cite 150 breeds of horse which have been inscribed in stud books, the first example of which 16 Thorstein Veblen, The Theory ofthe Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions (1899; London, 1970). 17Jean-Pierre Digard, Les Francais et leurs animaux (Paris, 1999); Jean-Pierre Digard, L'Homme et les animaux domestiques: anthropologic d'une passion (Paris, 1990); Bernadette Lizet, 'La Relation homme-cheval', in Raymond Pujol (ed.), L'Homme et I'animal: premier colloque d'ethnozoologie (Paris, 1975); Bernadette Lizet, Le Cheval dans la vie quotidienne: techniques et representations du cheval de travail dans l'Europe industrielle (Paris, 1982).</page><page sequence="8">120 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 199 was printed in England in 1791.x 8 Such diversity would have been quite unimaginable in the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries.19 There are thus a number of key intellectual preconditions we need to take into account when dealing with the history of eques trian culture. The field of study is defined by the intersection of long and short time-spans in which both internal and external factors intervene. It is located on the edge of the applied life sciences, in which very different contexts prevail. Its development is not unilinear nor defined simply by self-evident material pro gress. Finally, although with a little luck we may hope to know what horses have meant for men, it will always be difficult to understand what men meant for horses. If horses think, they have no awareness of the fact. In this lies a key paradox at the heart ofthe relationship between the two ? namely, that there is a sense in which, to reverse Buffon's famous adage,20 man is the horse's finest conquest. II THE EMERGENCE OF EQUESTRIAN CULTURE We may thus define equestrian culture as the whole range of relationships between man and a specific animal species, and how these relationships change over time. The ways in which that culture worked ? particularly around the hinge-period of the eighteenth century ? therefore need to be understood not only in terms of the animals and what influenced their use, but also in terms ofthe social and intellectual conditions ofthe soci eties which presided over their use, production and consumption. We may highlight three factors of consistent and particularly pressing relevance, which at every stage acted on the material and symbolic elements of the social world and on the esteem and notoriety that owning or using horses brought to social actors.21 The first of these was the horse's utility ? notably through its relationship to work. This structured usage into a function of 18 An Introduction to a General Stud-Book: Containing (with Few Exceptions) the Pedigree of Every Horse, Mare, &amp;c. of Note, that Has Appeared on the Turf for the Last Fifty Years, with Many of an Earlier Date; together with a Short Account ofthe Most Noted Arabians, Barbs, &amp;c.

Methods, xxxvii (2004). 20 See Buffon's text at n. 30 below. 21 Pierre Bourdieu, Esquisse d'une theorie de la pratique: precede de trois etudes d'ethno logie kabyle (1972; Paris, 2000), 366-75.</page><page sequence="9">EQUESTRIAN CULTURE IN FRANCE 121 the energy needs of town and countryside. A balance was in play here among the following elements: first, among the different empirical (though also theorized) needs of producers; second, among those of users, rearers, farmers, small peasants and cart drivers; and, third, among the principles developed in the riding schools, in the army, and in the stables of the aristocracy. Strength, stamina and speed become the features required ? to a greater or lesser extent ? from most horses. This modified the animal economy and impacted on specific practices. The status and rank ofthe animal and its users constituted a further element, notably as regards the elevated social position of many users who were often (though not always) guided by the precepts of 'court society'. Individuals of differing rank and means owned horses in the past, and the full range of relationships between men and horses is not reducible to the distinctive values ofthe aristocratic ideal. The latter ideal drew in the highest ranks of society, stimu lated sophisticated research by academic experts, and deter mined the motivations of the upper echelons of society and of hommes de cheval.22 But the ideal alone cannot explain the daily care and relationships, and indeed the passion for horses which existed within the world of work. A second factor was thus the technologies of control and production of horses; the daily link age to human effort, and pride in results presuppose values and forms of attachment which were present in differing measures in town and countryside.23 Horse-breeders, stable lads, carters, ploughmen and coachmen composed groups which it would be wrong to stereotype as being indifferent to social aesthetics. Such individuals were capable of passion24 ? and this could lead to conflicts over the production and use of horses.25 The fact that such individuals wrote very little and spoke reticently should not mislead us on this point. Gifted in invention, they were also quite capable of appropriating ideas and practices. The third factor in the final analysis shaping equestrian culture was the existence of soldiers and battles. For centuries, this fact 22 Baron [Charles-Maurice] de Vaux, Les Hommes de cheval depuis Baucher: les grands maitres; les ecuyers; les hommes de cheval; les cavaliers (Paris, 1888). 23 Lizet, Le Cheval dans la vie quotidienne, 99-133. 24 Thirsk, Horses in Early Modern England, 5. 25 Jacques Mulliez, 'Pratiques populaires et science bourgeoise: l'elevage des gros bestiaux en France de 1750 a 1850', in Abel Poitrineau (ed.), L'Elevage et la vie pastorale dans les montagnes de l'Europe au Moyen Age et a I'epoque moderne (Clermont-Ferrand, 1984).</page><page sequence="10">122 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 199 imposed demands, dictated imperatives in production, and set constraints on the world of horse-owning ? and it increased in importance in the context of the most crucial military develop ment in the early modern period: namely, growth in numbers. The increase acted on supply in ways which differed across time and space. It set in motion a shift in the relative proportions of draught horses as against cavalry mounts, and stimulated debates over what was the ideal type of horse to have. Europe was at this time caught up in a veritable equestrian ideology of power sym bolized by the 'War King' in whose person were conjoined ele ments of production, equestrian skill and the military art. The whole of society was involved in debates covering every branch of knowledge focused around la raison cavaliere ? the underlying rationale of a society dominated by horsemen, embracing social, economic, political and cultural factors.26 Time was a particularly significant factor in the reproduction and transformation of the relationships between men and ani mals. It operated at different rates in social, economic and aes thetic domains. Hence we must differentiate between the history of equestrian culture and the history of animals as it has recently been envisaged.27 The latter has taken long time-spans as its basis, has drawn on a considerable range of texts from zoology to literature of all kinds, and has analysed the horse's relationship with man, whether this be conceived in terms of co-operation, antagonism or indifference.28 The approach essayed here, in con trast, distinguishes decisive moments of encounter between men and horses within a very expansive chronological framework, focuses on social practices and is grounded in the contention that a horse is an unusual animal in that its subjection contributed to forging the image that men had of themselves.29 This viewpoint comes across powerfully in a famous text of Buffon: The noblest conquest ever made by man, over the brute creation, is the reduction of this spirited and haughty animal, which shares with him the fatigues of war and the glory of victory. Equally intrepid as his master, the horse sees the danger and encounters death with bravery; 26 Yves Grange, 'Le Cheval oublie: essai sur les aspects socio-politiques de la rela tion de l'homme et du cheval en France, 1614-1914' (Univ. of Grenoble Ph.D. thesis, 1981), 4-11. 27 Robert Delort, Les Animaux ont une histoire (Paris, 1984). 28 Ibid., 163-8. 29 Digard, Une histoire du cheval, 9-10.</page><page sequence="11">EQUESTRIAN CULTURE IN FRANCE 123 inspired at the clash of arms, he loves it and pursues the enemy with the same ardour and resolution. He feels pleasure also in the chace and in tournaments; in the course he is all fire; but equally tractable as courage ous, he does not give way to his impetuosity and knows how to check his natural and fiery temper. He not only submits to the arm which guides him but seems to consult the desires ofthe rider; and, always obedient to the impressions he receives, he presses on, or stops, at his rider's pleasure. The horse is a creature which renounces his very being for the service of man, whose will he even knows how to anticipate, and execute by the promptitude of his movements: he gives himself up without reserve, refuses nothing, exerts himself beyond his strength and often dies sooner than disobey.30 This wonderful passage, published in 1749, the year of Montesquieu's L'Esprit des lois, and just before the publication ofthe Encyclopedic, bears witness to a rare point of equilibrium. It initiates the natural history, both general and particular, ofthe horse, and forges a method which will be of major importance in the history of ideas. It places man at the centre of nature, con firming his superiority over all living beings, and places the horse at the peak of a hierarchy by reason of its proximity to humans, its utility and the way in which it contributes to man's image of himself.31 This magnificent yet totally anthropomorphic portrait confirms the mastery of men over horses, but as part of a tacit humanization that finds corroboration of the social order in the organization of nature. The horse accepts its subjection, and likes and relishes it even to the point of self-sacrifice. Yet Buffon, like any horseman, knows that everything about this bravura piece of writing may be contradicted ? for the horse is a timid animal, dressage comes only through endless effort and after long years of domestication, and the animal has to be taught, with difficulty, to accept battle. By placing war, spectacle, hunting, tournaments and racing at the centre of this vision ofthe horse, Buffon assigns to equine actors a status equivalent to that of their human mas ters. The remainder ofthe chapter underlines how this position had been gained only after a gruelling process of selection in 'ser vitude' and 'golden chains', a demanding process of filtering which established the 'nobility' of the natural prototype and 30 Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon, Histoire naturelle, generale etparticuliere, 15 vols.

(The account shows how Buffon regarded the idea of evolution.)32 But above all it also demon strates how an approach grounded in the use of analogy validates the quest for an order which, beyond nature, could confirm a social superiority gained after a long history in which an ever widening gap had developed between men and animals, and indeed between different social groups. At the same time, Buffon's text could serve as a theoretical basis for horse-breeding practices, as evidenced administratively in the royal stud-farms.33 If Buffon's vision to some degree falls within the Aristotelian lineage of 'histories' of animal life, it also helps us to understand a key moment in equestrian culture. The text highlights the prox imity ofthe horse to humans and initiates a quest for disseminat ing new forms of knowledge. It also balances positive against more negative observations ? the horse, for example, honoured in battle and in festivals; the horse ensnared in the hell of haulage and of tough and exhausting labour; the horse dominated; and the horse fearful of nature. In short, Buffon's zoological gaze sets up two accounts ? one of exploitation, placed under the sign of effort and suffering, and the other of a differentiated appropri ation throughout society based on sensibility and humanization. There is nothing in Buffon's text which allows us to know whether the great Intendant of the Jardin du Roi ever read Jonathan Swift. In both men's writings, however, we hear the echo of a certain familiarity, and the resonance of a distinctive and shared social vision, even though their preferences differed. Buffon owned horses both at the Jardin du Roi in Paris and at his Burgundian chateau and ironworks in Montbard, but he pre ferred to travel in a coach than to ride on horseback.34 In contrast, Swift's correspondence shows him to be something of an Irish cavalier, making visits on horseback and riding for pleasure. The rational horses of Gulliver's Travels, the strange and civilized Houyhnhnms, like the wild or tamed horses of Buffon, display the same confidence in reason, the same capacity for analysis and the same sensibility to education as a force that could simultaneously transform men and the animals closest to them. 32 Jacques Roger, Buffon, un philosophe aujardin du Roi (Paris, 1989), 389-404; Jacques Mulliez, Les Chevaux du royaume: histoire de I'elevage du cheval et de la creation des haras (Paris, 1983), 208-22; Grange, 'Le Cheval oublie', 108-30. 33 Buffon, CEuvres completes, i, 185-7. 34 ibid.</page><page sequence="13">EQUESTRIAN CULTURE IN FRANCE 12 5 It is not easy to illustrate the contact and proximity so agreeably described by Swift throughout his fable, especially at the moment of Gulliver's difficult readaptation to English life (which differs, travellers' accounts confirm, from life on the Continent). Contact and proximity are things of which few speak, and we have to con tent ourselves with indirect approximations. The latter rarely attain the degree of hippophilia characteristic of certain milieux, of which Swift's fable is an extreme account, intended to under line his philosophical point: namely, the antithesis between the goodness of horses and the evil of men. A certain sensibility of familiarity exudes from the text. The traveller who can no longer endure the smell of humans purchases a pair of young stallions 'that I keep in a good stable'. After the horses, it was the groom who is my greatest Favourite, for I feel my Spirits revived by the Smell he contracts in the Stable. My horses understand me tolerably well; I con verse with them at least four Hours a Day. They are Strangers to Bridle or Saddle; they live in great Amity with me, and Friendship to each other.35 We can glimpse here the response of a practical and daily user of horses towards the gap he could feel opening up between real atti tudes on the one hand and on the other the imaginary aspect of a relationship towards the animal, grounded in empathy. This kind of naturalization was almost inconceivable in earlier phases of equestrian culture. It stimulates us to reflect on the construction of attitudes towards horses, ranging from passion to exploitation and from respect to indifference, that we find, unfortunately only indirectly and rarely, in the vocabulary, specialized terms and writings of horsemen. These feelings were most often unspoken and, as is often the case, more in evidence among the elite than the masses. But their significance requires that we should consider, even if necessarily only briefly, how to understand this miscellan eous set of social conventions and affinities. Ill THE PLURAL READING OF SOCIAL PRACTICES The general lack of interest which historians across Europe ? perhaps with the exception of England ? have displayed for 35 Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels, ed. Claude Rawson (Oxford, 2005), 271.</page><page sequence="14">126 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 199 our subject is counterbalanced by the existence of an old and copious body of writing on it, highlighting differences between medieval and modern times. There is a good deal of continuity in social, symbolic and technical aspects across the two periods. The medievalists emphasize aspects which were symbolic (as with chivalry), social and military, while not neglecting everything that contributed to agricultural transformation. In focusing on the medieval horse as a costly expression of class privilege, we should not lose sight of the importance of horse-collars and nailed horseshoes.36 We lack such a wide-ranging synopsis for the early modern period for either France or England. Jean Pierre Digard recently emphasized the reasons for this analytical backwardness. 'In horse history, there are two totally separate and mutually ignorant literatures ? one written by horse profes sionals, the other by trained historians'.37 The former write his tory uncritically and in ignorance of the problematics of social and anthropological history, the latter are uninterested in the cul ture of horsemanship. The present-day status of the horse, plus the fact that we have lost sight ofthe former importance of eques trian culture, means that it does not form part ofthe main cultural imperatives of our time. No passing trend has yet related it to other, more fashionable topics of interest requiring less erudite specialization. We need to accept this obstacle to understanding and consider how we can change our ways of thinking. In order to do this, we must both get to know and learn how to transcend the two long-existent and trans-European traditions of writing which form the basis of our knowledge ofthe field: namely, general and encyclopedic histories on the one hand and histories ofthe eques trian arts on the other. In the first, we can recognize what in the nineteenth century Baron de Curnieu called 'general horse science'. This incorpo rated the basic culture of horsemen, partly valorized by practice, 36 By way of example: Lynn White Jr, Medieval Technology and Social Change (Oxford, 1962); Ann Hyland, The Medieval Warhorsefrom Byzantium to the Crusades (London, 1994); Philippe Contamine, La Guerre au Moyen Age, 2nd edn (Paris, 1986); Franco Cardini, Alle radici della cavalleria medievale (Florence, 1981); Brigitte Prevot and Bernard Ribemont, Le Cheval en France au Moyen Age: sa place dans le monde medieval, sa medecine, I'exemple d'un traite veterinaire du XVe siecle, la Cirurgie des chevaux (Orleans, 1994); Andrew Ayton, Knights and Warhorses: Military Service and the English Aristocracy under Edward III (Woodbridge, 1994), esp. chs. 2 and 6. 37 Digard, Une histoire du cheval, 9-10.</page><page sequence="15">EQUESTRIAN CULTURE IN FRANCE 127 partly linked to current debates, and partly connecting with the jumbled works of innumerable authors who had testified, opined and judged within this domain.38 What even specialists in the field regard as an 'undigested jumble' is indispensable, moreover, in that it recorded the needs and fashions of the equestrian mind.39 It allows us to understand what animated the vast domain of hippiatry, hippology, horse-rearing, veterinary interest and the requirements of horse-lovers as regards the animals and their harnesses.40 Economics, highly specialized techniques and the desire for utility were thus bound up with the imperatives of scientific understanding, the study of the animal in its environ ment, the influence of men, the creation of breeds as a result of selection and interbreeding, the mechanisms of reproduction, the science of nutrition ? in short the history of natural science from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century, applied to the horse.41 From the Renaissance to our day, this vast body of work consti tutes a pool of erudition which, though worthy of study, has up to now barely been skimmed either from the perspectives of book history or in regard to production and consumption practices. These writings, dating from the end of the Middle Ages to the beginning of the twentieth century, cover innumerable areas of inquiry. Set in context, they allow us to understand their relation to and tensions with the problems ofthe day, and to map society's capacity for innovation as well as the resistance encountered within the society of horsemen and among the reading public. The second domain is that ofthe historian ofthe equestrian art, of horsemanship and its developments, ofthe social uses of theory and ofthe confrontation of civilian and military traditions. Classic works in French and English (for example by Etienne Saurel, 38 C.-L. de Curnieu, Lecons de science hippique generale: ou, Traite complet de I'art de connaitre, de gouverner et d'elever le cheval, 3 vols, in 8 (Paris, 1855-60). 39 Mulliez, 'Pratiques populaires et science bourgeoise'; Rene Musset, De I'elevage du cheval en France (Paris, 1917), 8-15. 40 See, for example, Gabriel Rene Mennessier de la Lance, Essai de bibliographic hippique, donnant la description detaillee des ouvrages publies ou traduits en latin et en francais sur le cheval et la cavalerie, 3 vols.

But in some ways this is the problem. The history of theory and practice is above all a history of specialists. Its main interest lies in its very strong technical aspect, but this reduces its accessibility to those uninitiated in the ways of riding schools and academies. It is a history for those who know the facts already. The situation is worsened by the authors' lack of critical sense and by their belief in a linear model of progress. If 'general horse science' is dominated by hippology and utility, equestrian science is fasci nated by the elevated social status of those producing and diffus ing it. It focuses on horse masters and their pupils ? all from the privileged social orders ? and remains indifferent to the elemen tary and everyday conditions of the bulk of the population. Focused on wars and parades, it is always connected to power. To understand this body of writing on the equestrian art is an apprenticeship in itself. It initiates the reader into a language, a vocabulary, a grammar and a set of gestures which were based on sensual perception and imitation. We must therefore not lose sight of the fact that the words in these texts were elaborated in particular social practices. The writings ofthe great masters were inseparable from their social and cultural contexts, which were more complex than is often thought. They were composed in conjunction with an oral pedagogy based on situational examples and for uses which have not survived in the same form. As regards military tradition, for instance, the confrontation of tactical and strategic uses fostered debates on requirements in horses, on models and on the means of classifying and utilizing horses. The upshot of such debates was not influential everywhere in the same way. Whilst in France it was of crucial importance in the elaboration of norms for training horsemen, this was less the case in Great Britain.43 We must also move away from the idea of natural and linear progression implicit in this body of literature and seek to histori cize the relationship between men and horses by bringing ideas 42 Etienne Saurel, Le Cheval: equitation et sports hippiques (Paris, 1966); Etienne Saurel, Histoire de Vequitation: des origines a nos jours (Etrepilly, 1990); Andre Monteilhet, Les Maitres de Vozuvre equestre (Paris, 1979); Ann Hyland, The Endurance Horse: A World Survey from Ancient Civilizations to Modern Competition (London, 1988). 43 Roche, 'Pour un art de la cavalerie'.</page><page sequence="17">EQUESTRIAN CULTURE IN FRANCE 129 into line with practices. It would be interesting to know, for example, which of those historians more or less involved in research in this area could instantly understand certain terms whose meaning may seem clear and obvious. A cheval echappe, for example, is certainly a runaway ? but it also signifies the product of an often unintended interbreeding between different species. Embrasser un cheval rarely means to show a horse one's affection, and more normally signifies to grip it tightly between one's legs on the volte, the basic figure for limbering up.44 The history of individual words ought not to be an obstacle to under standing but rather a means of reintegrating our understanding of the different facets of a particular history. It would also help to break with the impression of a normal and progressive develop ment claiming to offer an account of the encounter and conflict between two allegedly inseparable domains of equestrian culture: on the one hand, the type of horsemanship which, lacking in theory and utterly empirical, is adjudged natural, spontaneous, popular and instinctive and is held to be transmitted orally by seeing, doing and hearsay; and on the other the horsemanship of the riding schools and academies, of riding masters and their privileged pupils, all possessing a doctrine and science. The latter conception of horsemanship is embedded in a relationship in which the written word complements and sanctifies the idea of riding transmitted by imitation, explanation, the Socratic rela tionship of teachers and pupils ? and the idea of art for art's sake. In fact, both orality and the power of example are universal within both models, but they are difficult to locate in documen tary research, which minimizes their presence. Similarly, even though the most technical writings are found only in very limited circles, the written word was not absent from more popular levels. We thus find ourselves confronting one ofthe major questions of historical method: how to understand the practices of the real through discursive practices, that is to say, to summarize Michel Foucault's definition, the set of rules which are immanent to a practice and which define its specificity ? which comes down to relating words to things, and experiences to discourses.45 44Corinne Delhay and Jean-Christophe Pellat, 'L'Invention du vocabulaire de l'equitation academique en France, XVIe-XVIIIe siecles', in Daniel Roche (ed.), De Pegase a Jappeloup: cheval et societe (Montbrison, 1996). 45 Michel Foucault, Les Mots et les choses: une archeologie des sciences humaines (Paris, 1966).</page><page sequence="18">130 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 199 In the books, the horseman at the riding school does not fall ? any more than he reads the manuals while in the saddle. Yet falls happen, and reading confirms the relationship established in other ways by practical apprenticeship. These texts are as difficult as they are fascinating for the untutored. But they are fundamental since, as Diderot noted, the language and the vocabulary of a people present the most faithful reflection of all the knowledge of the people. The tech nical literature foregrounds an 'art of doing', a way of thinking and acting, an 'art of combination indissoluble from the arts of use'.46 This body of literature still needs to be analysed in regard to exogenous factors ? the effects of time, unforeseeable events, social constraints, confrontations of the old and the new, and so on. We also have to take into account the differing rhythms of traditions, the changing status of bodies of knowledge, ruptures and reinventions. We should not avoid considering conflicts between different levels of knowledge and of practice as well as the spontaneous hippology of the popular classes, horse-rearing by those devoid of theory, the care of hippiatrists without scienti fic doctrine, the experience of the literate and the mediations of the illiterate. The terms 'learned' and 'popular' are useful here so long as one considers them as frontiers in a space which is not immobile. The same applies to the opposition between 'horse cultures' and chivalrous societies which ? as we have suggested ? provides an analytical framework for the study of equestrian cultures in the very long term.47 However, the latter emerge from the former to some extent and they become established only in contexts where the social, cultural and political differentiation of horse usage transforms social hierarchy and representations. Enclaves of the older model persist even within the aristocratic and noble (and also the absolutist and dirigiste) model, and this may modify the relationship between men and horses, and between consumption and appropriation. In his analysis of European cavalries, for example, Clausewitz noted that survivals and exchanges, vestiges and transfers from Tatar institutions persisted on the margins.48 The purely intuitive practices of 46 Michel de Certeau, LTnvention du quotidien, 2 vols.

A considerable part of production took place in areas not associated with those of riding masters, military men, or the great stables and studs of aristocratic rearers.49 In both England and France, the geogra phy of production highlighted a contrast between the customary areas of horse-rearing that produced poneys and bidets (such as marsh, scrubland and forests, as in the Cambridge Fens and the Welsh marches, or in Brittany, Poitou and the Boulonnais), and the mountainous zones. The latter produced horses which were decried but which, reared elsewhere, would become mounts or draught animals adapted to local needs. For a long time, England had a relationship with horses derived from the organization of social relationships in the countryside which was very different from that of France. Eighteenth-century travellers saw this contrast when travelling along rural lanes and finding themselves not always able to understand the orders given to the horses by farm boys and cart drivers. Evident familiarity based on close cohabitation of men and horses survived in England, even when geographical separation, urbanization and regional specialization were taking place, and when the rather different sensibility of hippophilia was emerging.50 IV FROM SOURCES TO IMAGES The two major traditions of reading which I have sketched out allow us to grasp the main frameworks of a highly differentiated history. Bringing the subject to life and bringing it up to date, however, require discovery and research in every type of archive ? for unfortunately there is no specific and completely homoge neous source for our subject. We thus have to put to use a whole set of texts from different sources, derived from different levels, from local to national. These research difficulties inhibit a really comparative approach, for throughout the countries of Europe studies and sources are unevenly represented. Comparisons 49Mulliez, Les Chevaux du royaume, 223-75. For the same phenomenon in England, see Peter Edwards, The Horse Trade of Tudor and Stuart England (Cambridge, 1988). 50 Thomas, Man and the Natural World, 126-7'.</page><page sequence="20">132 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 199 attempted thus far either focus on precise themes or else present broad generalizations.51 We can start out by consulting archival sources already much used for their richness: administrative sources stimulated by the needs ofthe army and the state, for example, and economic docu mentation arising from the constraints of agricultural and indus trial production, and from the needs of trade and commerce. The range of further sources ? public and private ? is very wide, running from market series to notarial documents, and from account books to private correspondence.52 We must be guided by the research in hand, and results are dependent on time and chance. Thus, as regards the horse trade, Peter Edwards found merchants' accounts and fair books from the Tudor and Stuart period which allowed him to make estimates that in France, where no such source exists, can only be dreamed of. Edwards's use of notarized inventories can be of more general exemplary value, however, since these documents are found everywhere. The omnipresence ofthe horse is from this point of view a favour able factor, but it is also a difficulty, for horses are both every where and nowhere. Thus for Tudor and Stuart England we can know with some exactness the movement of the market down to the types of horse involved, their function, their characteristics (sex, colour, age, proportions, measurements, distinguishing marks, appearance), their price and their buyers and sellers ? in sum the whole structure of the horse trade, including the importance of family relationships, as Alan Everitt has shown. By means of these exceptional sources, we can follow the long distance mobility of horses, and see how the decried products of Scotland (especially Galloway), south-west England and Montgomeryshire find takers even though they do not measure up to the norms imposed by legislation from the seventeenth century onwards aimed at the production of small horses. Lack of equivalent archives prevents such a study for France, although reports from stud managers and from the remount services allow 51 Daniel Roche and Daniel Reytier (eds.), Les Ecuries royales: du XVf au XVIIT siecle (Paris, 1998); Daniel Roche and Daniel Reytier (eds.), Voitures, chevaux et atte lages: du XVf au XIXs siecle (Paris, 2000); Roche and Reytier (eds.), Le Cheval et la guerre. 52 Nicole de Blomac, 'Cheval et histoire', in [Nicole de Blomac (ed.)], Les Sources de I'histoire du cheval dans les archives publiques francaises (Paris, 1993), 9-18.

Bankruptcy records help here too ? though unfortunately the archives ofthe Parisian markets were burnt during the 1871 Commune.53 Historians must also not overlook other often used sources which present problems of bias and whose analysis demands care. The savour of a literary text is irreplaceable when used to illustrate a point. Thus John Greene has made excellent use ofthe writings of French travellers in England such as Grosley, de Beaumont, Lacombe and others in analysing the cultural divide which separated British hippomania from French-style aristo cratic utilitarianism.54 However, if this literature registers a wide range of situations and usages, and to some degree allows us to measure the existence of a horse market and its trends, lit erary sources can lead us rapidly into the banalities of 'daily life studies'55 or the pursuit of mentalites. Other approaches are necessary for social and cultural analysis. We need to interrogate such sources for their context, and also through the analysis of their literary properties. The novel is not a traveller's account and both differ from intimate and reflexive documents. In most such sources, the horse marks a blind spot within the narrative, and characters pay no more attention to it than indivi duals in real life. At different times, it may participate in the plot, contributing towards the spatial separation of characters, produ cing descriptive effects, endorsing the psychology of the hero or echoing the social and political vision which drives the work. The literary horse thus may produce multiple effects, both narrative and descriptive, which underline in which areas in real life the horse is found. A rich and multiple signifier, the literary horse always requires careful deciphering. Thus if we take the works of Montaigne ? from the Essais to the Recit de voyage ? we discover the ingredients of the equestrian culture of a Gascon nobleman who represents a particular social milieu in civil, military and political life. Montaigne the horseman is not, however, simply 53 Edwards, Horse Trade of Tudor and Stuart England, 172-83; Alan Everitt, 'The Marketing of Agricultural Produce', in Joan Thirsk (ed.), The Agrarian History of England and Wales, iv, 1500-1640 (Cambridge, 1967), 513-15, 557-9. 54 John Greene, 'Ces "enfants cheris": comment les Francais percoivent l'hippo manie anglaise des XVIIIe-XIXe siecles', in Daniel Roche and Daniel Reytier (eds.), A cheval!

Rather, he is key witness to the whole multifaceted experience of riding which he himself doubtless acquired both through practice and through reading. He displays an intelligent competence as regards uses of the horse: thus we know that he was hostile to carriages and that in Italy he had been on the fringes ofthe most artistic experiments in horsemanship. Moreover, reading Montaigne allows us to glimpse how the horse in history may have moral connotations. It is as a horseman, in the saddle, that Montaigne liked to live, and it is on a horse that he would have liked to die. The story he tells of a fall from his horse had a philosophical significance. He placed himself in a totally banal situation and mobilized the teachings of an ethical tradition deriving from the conversion of St Paul, offering a personal, sec ularized reading of it in a way which made his own experience a paradigm of existence and ofhis general disposition of being. A fall ? the most common of accidents for a horseman, though an accident which is rightly feared ? was for him a means of finding a sweet and peaceful existence, it was necessary to the progress of a life, and it tamed fear of death.56 Literary experience thus offers more than a reflection of pre existent equestrian reality. It supplies a way of understanding life from within, and seeing it in dialogue with numerous situa tions conveying meanings and lessons.57 Then again with the Enlightenment novelist Retif de La Bretonne, carriages, har nesses and horses may be the images of the material life and social status of the elites ? but beyond that they are also incor porated into his portrait of a corrupt urban society and into his vision ofthe world and of politics.58 We could show very much the same thing in the tried and tested way of using visual images as confirmation of words. Visual sources range from painting, drawing and engraving through to photography from the nineteenth century and cinema today. The profusion of images in itself confirms the privileged status that man recognizes in his 'first conquest'. Horses endlessly inspire 56 Roche, 'Montaigne cavalier'.

We can make double usage ofthe figurative arts if we admit that alongside their primary function of illustrating or reflecting reality they also maintain in the gaze ofthe spectator the status of works of art as well as of living horses. Painters select particular features of taste, which in turn highlight links to bodies of knowledge. Thus Stubbs developed the elongated model ofthe English thoroughbred in a way which was in line with the expectations of English horse lovers but which was not easy for their continental peers, who were used to the stockier horses of their own riding academies and riding masters. Alongside what, to put it crudely, we might call the tradition of realist observation, information delivered depends less on verisimilitude than on the simultaneous capacity to depict what cannot be observed in other ways ? the bit in the horse's mouth, the position ofthe reins on the masked side ofthe figure, and what one does not really see without explanation, such as the horseman's mounted position according to the norms of the equestrian art, or else the characteristics which allow us to identify a particular species ? a Limousin horse, for example, as opposed to an Auvergnat one, or a Percheron at the moment of its birth at the end ofthe eighteenth century. The movements taught by riding masters correspond to the visual code adopted by artists, representing in a particular manner the haughty mien of the horse of a prince, or the epic gallop ofthe war-horse. In regard to visual tradition and the aesthetic imaginary, we can perceive situations that are dictated by conventions and by the constraints of fashion in both art and horsemanship. We know, for example, that from the sixteenth century equestrian society was endlessly seeking out norms and that the good and beautiful horse became a social model and an academic requirement. In the eighteenth century, Claude Bourgelat coined an aphorism which united the intellectual with the practical. 'To be perfect, a horse should combine beauty with the qualities which can make it useful, that is, with goodness'.59 In his article 'Beau' in the Encyclopedic, Diderot wrote 'something is only beautiful if it is 59 Claude Bourgelat, Elemens d'hippiatrique: ou, Nouveaux principes sur la connais sance et sur la medecine des chevaux.. . contenant la connaissance consideree exterieurement et un traite abrege, theorique et pratique de laferrure, i (Lyon, 1750), 539-40.</page><page sequence="24">136 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 199 founded on utility'. This idea was in tune with the aesthetics ofthe Enlightenment and the notion that what defined beauty was 'order, relations, proportions, arrangements, symmetry, propri ety'. This applied as much to a beautiful horse as to any other object. In all cases, the beautiful derived from a practice of dis cernment. Aesthetic judgement was simultaneously both relative and objective, and linked to inner, individual feelings. What was beautiful was one ofthe things of which men speak the most and which they know the least'. The figurative arts help us to under stand how horses were often seen from the point of view of an aesthete or connoisseur and, more often, of an observer of horses.60 This was the case with the marquis d'Argenson, a col lector and artistic patron, who had the capacity to see and judge signs as a function of the purpose of the subject under exam ination. Historians thus need images to allow us to see and understand 'the secrecy of appearances', as Hegel would put it, and to go beyond appearances.61 Horses in paintings question the different ways in which they are represented more generally, and their overlapping relationships to social, utilitarian and symbolic prac tices. They show the formal evolution of taste in regard to the horse, both in imagination and in reality. They give insight into ways of visual and sensory knowing. From illustrations in anatomical works and works of equestrian art to major history paintings, royal equestrian statues and sporting art, such repre sentations render spectacle visible in all its social and cognitive manifestations. As omnipresent in art as in society, the horse is a source which we must read through subjects, genres, representa tions, both realistic and imaginary, all of which vary according to author and cultural context. Stephen Deuchar demonstrates this in the case of eighteenth-century England, where the art of Stubbs may be set against the social and rural realities of 'sporting art'.62 60 Nicole de Blomac, 'Le Cheval, moyen et mode de vie: l'oeuvre du marquis de Voyer, militaire, philosophe et entrepreneur (1722-1782)', 2 vols. (Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris, Ph.D. thesis, 2002), i, 417-21. 61 Hegel cited in Gerard Bras, Hegeletl'art, 2nd edn (Paris, 1994), in de Blomac, 'Le Cheval, moyen et mode de vie', i, 419. 62 Stephen Deuchar, Sporting Art in Eighteenth-Century England: A Social and Political History (New Haven, 1988).</page><page sequence="25">EQUESTRIAN CULTURE IN FRANCE 137 V SPACE AND GESTURE IN EQUESTRIAN CULTURE Perceived in these different literary traditions as well as in the varied levels of archives and of written documents, equestrian culture covers a great many forms of behaviour. We can gain fur ther insight, moreover, if we follow three overlapping and mutu ally supportive approaches. These are similar to the factors, 'service, pleasure and power', suggested by Joan Thirsk,63 and take into account for France possible comparisons with other forms of national development, not least in England. We shall, first, analyse the everyday utility ofthe horse; second, consider it in regard to social distinction and military and political endorse ment; and, third, seek to trace man's cognitive, sensory and visual relations with the horse. At first sight, there is nothing surprising about the widespread presence ofthe Equidae. But this fact actually conceals a wealth of hierarchical variety.64 As with human society, the world of horses, mules and asses is a hierarchical one. In terms of sex, mares and geldings are more numerous, but, in terms of age, stallions live longer, while there is also a hierarchy in terms of reproduction, work, species, breeds, models and rank within the stable. In short, a demographic approach is necessary, though one which is com plicated, for the demographic categories cut across social choices, customs, the transport of men and goods, saddlery, draught, packsaddle, and so on. Custom and constraint enter into every choice concerning a horse, and every demand by purchasers and users, just as the supply of breeders and merchants influences the market and social needs. The rural notable from the Limousin could get by with a robust old nag, while a seigneur on whom urban manners had rubbed off followed fashion, modifying his stable of hunters and travelling horses as well as the composition of his kennels.65 The interplay of production and exchange estab lished a certain geography, some of whose features lasted for cen turies, while others were more changeable. There was an 'equine 63 See at n. 1 above. 4Mulliez, Les Chevaux du royaume, 8-10; Musset, De I'elevage du cheval, 1-50; Edwards, Horse Trade of Tudor and Stuart England, 1-20, 173-80. 65 Nicole Lemaitre, Le Scribe et le mage: notaires et societe rurale en Bas-Limousin aux XVT et XVIT siecles (Ussel, 2000), 68-70; Pierre de Vaissiere, Gentilshommes cam pagnards de I'ancienne France (1903; Etrepilly, 1986), 104-78, 310-84.</page><page sequence="26">138 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 199 France', for example, as opposed to a more southerly zone where cattle, mules and asses were dominant. Yet even in the south there were enclaves of equestrian concentration linked to seigneurs, towns and merchants. The balance shifted in the nineteenth cen tury, moreover, with big carthorses coming into the south. So too in England, sites of production and consumption did not coin cide, and roads, towns, ports and new industrial areas all created favourable conditions for developments linked to energy and cir culation. More regional studies focused on these sites would allow us to understand the linkages. We also need to go beyond the geographical distribution of horses to understand their mobility. In France, no study yet exists similar to what Edwards has done for certain English counties, or what Yelling, through the use of post-mortem inventories between 1540 and 1750, has shown in his analysis of horse-rearing in Worcestershire. But on both sides of the Channel it would be good to take the story well into the nineteenth century. A good case study which does this is Lizet's monograph on the appearance ofthe black horse (la bete noire) in the Nivernais in the nineteenth century. The horse's vogue derived from the demand for draught animals stimulated by the intensification of mobility of all kinds linked to railway develop ment. In the same vein, Moriceau has shown how the emergence of large-scale horse-rearing on the big farms ofthe Ile-de-France was tied up with the extension of large-scale farming methods on the physiocratic model.66 Only the comparison of local and national inquiries with other estimates will allow us to settle once and for all the validity ofthe haunting fear in French political and military circles that the country lacked a sufficient number of good horses ? a fear which was constantly reiterated from the seventeenth right through to the twentieth century. We know that England got 66 Roche, Humeurs vagabondes, 200-34; Daniel Roche, 'Le Cheval et ses elevages: perspectives de recherche', and Daniel Roche, 'L'Animal domestique (XVIe-XIXe siecles)', both in Cahiers d'histoire, xiii (1997); Edwards, Horse Trade of Tudor and Stuart England, ch. 1; J.

In France, we also know that the categories of evaluation were dictated partly by the wish to base economic development on large open fields and also by the 'Cantillon effect' ? the notion that since a horse consumes the food of several workers, why should it be encouraged?68 The answers to such questions are separate but closely inter linked. Thus towns did not produce horses, but consumed them ? in large numbers too ? and got through them quickly. The career of a Perche horse in the main Paris omnibus company in the nineteenth century rarely exceeded five years. The stable of a nobleman was constantly needing refreshment too, for horses are fragile and often suffered as a result of what was demanded of them ? but sometimes too they were replaced simply because their master did not like them. To understand these problems we need to follow the trajectory which leads from urban sheds and stables to inns, stopping places for cart drivers, and then through to the streets, where traffic is controlled. A fundamental transformation of equestrian culture occurred in fact when traction became preponderant over other uses. High society set the pace, but urban space was also, of course, particu larly affected by the presence of horses. Cities had to resolve daily problems in terms of lodging, feeding and watering the horses, and attending to the growing numbers of horsemen. Wherever fairs and markets introduced problems of localization, surveil lance and management, the network of horse-dealers corre sponded to the level of the trade. Paris was a national centre for such trade as London was in England, while Chester, for example, had a role within the north-west of England just as the Caen fair did for Normandy.69 In the villages, we find the same 67 Breeding was controlled by the state through the royal studs: Edwards, Horse Trade of Tudor and Stuart England, 140-6. 68Mulliez, Les Chevaux du royaume, 310-15, 333-40; Michel Demonet, Tableau de l'agriculture frangaise au milieu du XIXs siecle: I'enquete de 1852 (Paris, 1990), 81-90; Roche, Histoire des choses banales, 20-41. 69 Nicole de Blomac, 'Equitation de cour, equitation de guerre', in Roche and Reytier (eds.), Les Ecuries royales; Jean-Louis Libourel, Voitures hippomobiles: vocabu laire typologique et technique (Paris, 2004), 5-21.

The presence of the horse modified production and exchange, and helped to determine the speed of the transformations by which barriers were broken down, ending geographical isola tion.70 Between the village and the town, the road ? and the trades and techniques associated with it ? formed a continuous spectrum. This world of the road is poorly known but seems to have comprised a professional sphere in which tasks of upkeep, care and presentation of animals followed a division of labour. In areas in which rural dispersion (in contrast to urban concen tration) coincided with weak levels of technical knowledge and poor rolling stock due to lack of investment, the professions ofthe harness, from carter to carriage-maker, covered a range of social categories. All production and exchange were linked to the cap acity for upkeep and forethought, the inferred effects of which were numerous within all levels of the economy. Paul Bairoch mapped out the consequences of this for the Industrial Revolution on the basis that the horse was a renewable consumer good whose permanence imposed demand.71 Three million horses required 300 metric tonnes of horseshoes a year for the maintenance of their hooves alone. At every level, society's rela tionship to the horse inspires us to revise existing interpretations. The history of horses intersects with the history of elites and power at a high level, yet also, on similar lines, with the popular and middle classes. The traditional organization of a 'society of orders' registered a clash in ways of conceptualizing the world. Representations ofthe three orders, or estates, showed the nobil ity on a horse and the clergy astride a mule, while the people travelled on foot. Prior to 1789, the peasant was often represented as the steed on which the two other orders sat. These political (n. 69 cont.) siecle, 2 vols.

In 1791, the good citizen Baudot proclaimed: 'I think more highly of the genealogy of an Arab racer than of a duke or peer. The genealogy ofthe horse has some market value; that of a duke or peer is mere show'.72 The Jockey Club, founded in the 1830s, came to be dominated by the old and new aristocracies. This fundamental transformation of the behaviour of urban elites is especially evident in lifestyle. Great writers such as Flaubert, in his Sentimental Education, and Zola, in the Rougon-Macquart novel-cycle, showed the importance attached to horses and carriages in worldly affairs. Promenades in the Bois de Boulogne, and the display of elegance on the Champs-Elysees and the boulevards, formed an integral part of daily sociability. The great mansions of the old and new aristocracy were rebuilt with modernized stable-blocks, which became meeting places for horse-lovers. The regular calendar of horse races, now with a popular following, brought together the world ofthe horse with aristocratic and bourgeois groupings. In France, the interest in racing in the eighteenth century had been short-lived, but in the nineteenth century the government encouraged horse racing in the provinces as well as in Paris. As in England, horse racing came to have an impact on horse-rearing. And it formed one ofthe phenomena associated with the growth of modern leisure pursuits and the new consumption of time and money.73 The nobility's zeal for horses shows how social power functioned in practice. Horses corresponded to traditions of dis tinction within the wider society and within the noble hierarchy itself. By expenditure, training and a set of daily practices, the nobility constituted a key milieu in which equestrian culture developed. 72 Marc-Antoine Baudot, Notes historiques sur la Convention Nationale, le Directoire, I'Empire et I'exil des votants (Paris, 1893), 314. 73 Nicole de Blomac, La Gloire et lejeu: des hommes et des chevaux (1766?1866) (Paris, 1991), 180-95, 198-206; Jean-Pierre Blay, Les Princes et les jockeys: Chantilly (XVIIT-XXs siecles) (Biarritz, 2006).

The first saw the triumph of horse-drawn carriages for public transport as well as for private travel. New techniques and skills responded to the new sensibility. The need to go faster (but still safely) had a notable impact on carriage design and on horses too, which had to be more powerful to be effective. For the nobility, the use of a horse-drawn carriage became a mark of social distinction alongside the practice of horse-riding. To be seated in a carriage is not the same as riding in the saddle, even if both display the social symbolism of class. The second phase began with the railways, which facilitated new levels of mobility and established a new kind of relationship with horses and carriages. These retained their role as social markers but carriages were less functional than indicators of leisure pref erence and of the endorsement of social taste and class. These new sensibilities revealed the integration ofthe elites within urban culture and a modern industrial economy. The same was true in regard to the automobile and aviation, as David Cannadine has shown for Great Britain. Horses became signs of regret and nos talgia, endorsing old values, just as new forms of transport were triumphing definitively.74 Similarly, along with the symbol ofthe monarch on horseback, horses still constituted a dynamic repre sentation of power. Whether they were warriors or men of peace, kings on horseback endorsed a certain rationale revolving around the royal person as master ofthe state ? the soul ofthe world, as Hegel wrote on 13 October 1806 at Jena.75 The equestrian arts also helped produce political submission. The royal court and its stables were the means by which the spectacle of the monarchy, and its mobility, were displayed. The cavalry was a state instru ment for controlling violence. Furthermore, the state was nothing without its horses, and military demand was always a powerful means of endorsing stock-rearing policies.

The plots of Stendhal's Scarlet and Black and Lucien Leuwen revolve around this consideration. The nation state, in managing a varying volume of horses in times of peace and war, also became both a major client and a deter minant economic actor. With equestrian theory no longer simply the province of the nobility and the court, a new social economy emerged in relation to military institutions, conceptions of race, and theories of social management.77 War saved the horse for a short time ? in spite ofthe advantages ofthe machine. The sites of equestrian culture, therefore, were numerous: pas tures and stables, farms and markets, noble and bourgeois resi dences, company depots, inns and coaching stalls. It would be wrong to think that the non-noble social actors on these sites were ignorant, unlettered and driven only by sheer necessity and custom. Forms of knowledge and attachment existed, along with general and popular learning, often diffused in vulgarized forms of intellectual knowledge. Also, equestrian culture incor porated its own developments, debates and orientations within this literature and in art. Libraries, learned cabinets, connois seurs' collections, and laboratories of scientific institutions all participated in the diffusion of such texts. For the nineteenth century, we can follow them in the specialized press too ? a sub ject which awaits its historian. The Journal des chevaux et des chasses, which the former cavalry officer J. B. May quietly launched in 1834, is one example, though it disappeared with the tragic death of its founder in a duel. More successful was the Journal des haras, des chasses et des courses, which ? from 1828 to 1888 ? was the most popular ofthe equine journals. The Journal de medecine veterinaire appeared between 1845 and 1905. The Revue de cavalerie, crucial for the whole army, appeared from 1885 to 1910 as a monthly: for the cavalry elites 76 Denis Bogros, 'Essai d'analyse du discours francais sur l'equitation arabe' (1988): &lt;http://www.miscellanees.eom/b/bogros04.htm&gt;. 77 Yves Grange, 'Signification du role politique du cheval (XVHP-XIXe siecles)', in Jean-Pierre Digard (ed.), Des chevaux et des hommes: equitation etsociete (Lausanne and Avignon, 1988), 63-72.</page><page sequence="32">144 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 199 it was a means of confronting traditions, innovations and discus sions at a moment when horses had not yet been replaced and were still regarded as indispensable.78 This press allows us to explore the expanding production of books of hippology across a wide field and, thanks to the growth of literacy and book culture, aimed at all kinds of publics. Through the printed word, we can also estimate the develop ment and impact of hippology in France, Germany and England.79 In France, for example, scarcely 500 books, pamph lets or other works appeared on the topic between the sixteenth and the end of the eighteenth century. The equestrian art made up 10 per cent of these; cavalry about a quarter; law, history and political or imagined uses, 17 per cent; and hippiatry, breeding and technical matters, some 46 per cent. Through this means, we can glimpse agencies of change within society as well as ideo logical forces and issues within equestrian culture.80 The nine teenth century saw production expand massively, extending the size of the public and focusing debates around hippiatry, which was now being transformed by veterinary medicine, cavalry and socio-economic needs. The horse had entered the public sphere and found a place in agronomic debates as well as in political quarrels.81 To approach equestrian culture through its debates takes the historian into the field ofthe history of sensibility and the ways in which the particular relationships between men and horses were expressed. The equestrian art itself, in a codified way, registers the passion of riders, their analytical and scientific competence, and also the way in which a palpable bodily liaison established by practice can then be expressed as an emotional reaction, indeed as an affection. These both reinforced and nuanced relations of proximity established for centuries and ratified by social and peda gogic models, by utilitarian and instinctive forms, by bodily prac tices and by technical gestures. The crystallization of this sensibility may be grasped by chance in individual cases ? think 78 Mennessier de la Lance, Essai de bibliographic hippique, i, 697-700; ii, 371-2. 79 For recent studies ofthe medieval period, see n. 36 above. 80 Roche, 'Le Livre d'equitation', 190-4. 81 [Victor-Donatien de Musset-Pathay], Bibliographic agronomique: ou, Dictionnaire raisonne des ouvrages sur I'economie rurale et domestique, sur l'art veterinaire (Paris, 1810); Jean Froissart, 'La Querelle d'Aure-Baucher: miroir du climat social et politique de l'epoque', in Digard (ed.), Des chevaux et des hommes.</page><page sequence="33">EQUESTRIAN CULTURE IN FRANCE 145 of Swift, Alfieri and others82 ? that are stumbled across in read ing. Very early in the history of the equestrian arts, control of violence is required and this goes on to become an integral part ofthe norms of a 'civilization of manners'. The staging of major spectacles by courts and cities, carousels and cavalcades, parades and march pasts, peasant races and aris tocratic competitions helped to promote passion for man's 'first conquest'. A shift was evident over time, from a restrained pro motion, derived from the attachment and distinctive taste of a connoisseur, towards a more generalized enthusiasm for the horse as spectacle. The circus and painting provide new forms in which the sphere of leisure and the field of utilitarian function combined and brought together the most diverse social groups in a spectacle full of myth and expectation. * * For centuries, equestrian culture was an expression ofthe pro found relationship between the society of men and that of animals in the West as elsewhere. In all domains of human activity, it highlighted the needs of town and countryside, and of the dom inant and the dominated. It was promoted by numerous social actors. It unified sensibilities as regards involvement in nature and in the techniques which have transformed it. The study of eques trian culture allows historians to understand a privileged relation ship which unified and connected man and animals, and a mobilization of energies around a form of appropriation that was utilitarian but at the same time never merely that. As it involved living beings, it stimulated sensibilities, establishing con stant links between thought and action, horse and horseman, horses and those who domesticated them, mobilized them, loved them or rejected them.83 La raison cavaliere in all its aspects created relationships of seduction and power which are similar to those which men establish with their peers. It still has much to tell us about our past and ourselves.84 College de France, Paris Daniel Roche 82 Swift, Gulliver's Travels; Vita di Vittorio Alfieri scritta da esso (Turin, 1981).
