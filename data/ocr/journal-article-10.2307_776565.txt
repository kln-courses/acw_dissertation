<plain_text><page sequence="1">Auctoanimals (Samozver i) Autoanimals By Sergei Mikhailovich Tretiakov Translated by Susan Cook Summer Have I fallen from the moon? Elephants are a walk in the room. I see a kangaroo does bound Behind the kennel of the hound. With the cuttlefish goes the seal, Along the hall I see them steal. The kitchen door stands ajar- A pair of turtles crawls quite far. Ah! Help! Against the door I throw my bulk, Crushed beneath the elephant's hulk. With my head against a beam Suddenly there comes a scream: There-coward! Ah! How silly can I be, Surely they will not eat me These animals-autoanimals. Figs. 1-6 Alexander Rodchenko, photo-illustration for Autoanimals, 1926. Private Collection. Busy with affairs quite important, Carrying a burden is the elephant. He has a collected character As he pumps water and hauls lumber. The elephant's life is very long, For three hundred years he goes on strong. Go ahead, try and see If the elephant with his knee Picks his trunk. He has been brought up and has been coached Not like people-but almost. Yasha, Gavrik along with Petya Have their very own Africa. For the tusk-a log, for the trunk-pants, And a blanket for the skin. Citizens! Look this way! 242 ArtJournal See what they can portray! In a knot his tail is bound, And through the house he walks round and round. Heavily his steps do sag As he must his trunk to drag. He lives in an apartment chalice And frightens all with his cry of malice. But he cannot be called real For he walks around in heels. The courtyard is sown with someone. It is the tortoise, trying to run. From the fence to the vase, Two vershoks an hour his pace. The tortoise never bears a scowl, And if a dog begins to howl, The tortoise answers with a squeal And leaves protected by his shield. Fedya crawls down on the sly To be a tortoise he can on the washtub rely. A hand-to Fedya. The tub falls with a fuss. But is he worse off than the tortoise? Make a note, all of you fellows, In the south the ostrich grows. It runs all day amongst the heathers Covered up in ostrich feathers. Greater than wind velocity, At 100 miles an hour he's quite speedy. The ostrich would not eat anyone, He eats but grass and nails: bong, bong. But when he feels the need to hide, This dumb bird lifts his arm up wide. Underneath he puts his head And thinks he will be neglected. Fig2</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 4 Fig. 5 Right into his back Matvei Pokes in branches in a special way. All he really has to do Is create a head on the count of two. With a ball on the end of a stick He makes a head that looks quite slick. But if anyone tries to catch this one, The head under his arm, off he will run. Crossing bridge and river on his way, It is the head that he will mislay. There on the ice slick and smooth Sleeps the seal, too lazyto move. Just like an oar is his hand-like fin, And his layers of fat warm him under the skin. Near the poles lamps are not needed, The sun stays aloft, quite unheeded. To meet the sun the fish does swim, And waking the seal says "thanks" to him. The seal's not too lazy to eat the beast, And grabs him quickly with his teeth. While looking at the sky and mooring, He eats the fish without even salting. It takes quite little to become a seal, Just wrap up in a blanket and start to reel. Lie on the floor and try to swim, While catching fish with your hand-like fin. Eating all the leaves with ease, The giraffe lives amongst the trees. With a neck that almost never ends, He eats and ever prettier tends. He could hardly be a house dweller With nose in the chimney and feet in the cellar. When it comes to the apartment's heat The giraffe requires a truly great feat. Lyolka and Kolka, noses in air, Try to copy the giraffe's manner and flair. But as they are walking they are quite blind, Eventually they will probably be fined. When their giraffe walks it can't see ahead, With eyes on the chest and not in the head. Out there where the waves rush and swish Lives and nests the cuttlefish. Its body looks like a small cupola And from it protrude two antenna. About safety not to have to think, It carries around a sack of black ink. There she is, there is the crayfish, Go ahead, enemy, if you so wish. But don't fight.

The enemy's eyes Are blinded by surprise As the cuttlefish Quickly glides back back back Home. In a tiny corner moving back Katya's cuttlefish peers out of a sack. And as she peers at the enemy through a crack Suddenly The enemy Jumps! And they meet Prfff? And they meet Chufff! A jump-a meow-a great big blitz Exults and rejoices the cuttlefish. Don't you want to appreciate How the victors jubilate? Out in Australia where it's hot day and night Lives the kangaroo with a jump so light. She knows how, as with a piece of rail, To help her jump using her tail. She is fashioned quite conveniently With a bag built on to her belly. This bag which is on her stomach hung Is there for the little ones. And there in the bag squeezed together like glue There are five merry little kangaroos. And to a jump filled with frenzy They gaze about whistling continuously. Vanechka is busy with a game: Like the kangaroo, he jumps the same. Vanechka has quite a speed, Though his tail he must always heed. And to Vanechka's lively dance Two pups in his schoolbag sob and prance. There's a real horse, just look at him, If you touch your spur against his skin He will gallop off from the place, Leaving his rider in a total daze. But over a question quite trivial The head of this horse breaks from the tail. It was a disgrace, all this fret and fray And each horse-half ran off in a different way. The front To the corridor The behind To the yard And the rider sat where he was with a scream: "BUT WHAT CAN THIS ALL MEAN?"

In 1923, he was a founding member of LEF (Left Front of the Arts), the Moscow journal of literature, criticism and art, whose editorial staff included the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky and the critic Osip Brik. LEF was published from 1923 to 1925 and published as Novyi LEF (New LEF) in 1927 and 1928. Tretiakov took over the position of editor-in-chief of Novyi LEF from Mayakovsky for the last five numbers issued in 1928. Tretiakov's most important works include Listen, Moscow!, an agit-play produced in 1923 by the cinematographer Sergei Eisen- stein; Roar, China, a propagandistic play of 1926; and China Testament: TheAutobiogra- phy of Tan Shih-hua of 1934. Also, in 1929 he contributed seven essays to the Literature of Fact, edited by Vladimir Chuzhak, which hailed the death of fiction and advocated literature that would express Marxist-Leninist theories as the cornerstone of the new (Soviet) society. Tretiakov was purged and apparently exe- cuted during the late 1930s. His works were "rehabilitated" in the Soviet Union in 1956. The background of the poem: Whereas the earlier LEF was more insistently devoted to agitational propaganda ("agit-prop")-includ- ing optimistic manifestoes and excited rallying cries ("For Innovation!")-the laterNovyi LEF placed greater emphasis on straightforward factography and advocated a platform of utili- tarian arts. Tretiakov's unpublished text for Autoanimals dates from 1926, a year in which the LEF presses lay dormant. This poem seems to represent for the author a breathing period between the stringent ideological demands of LEF and Novyi LEF. Perhaps Tretiakov was indulging some personal whim, seeking creative expression in a work not necessarily motivated by external sociopolitical conditions. Unlike much Soviet children's literature of this period, Autoanimals is not propagandistic. It retains the whimsy of Old Russian fairy tales and some of the fantasy of Nikolai Leskov's 1873 novel The Enchanted Wanderer. The poem is unusual in Tretiakov's oeuvre, which is more generally of a documentary nature, but it stands -along with Alexander Rodchenko's photo- illustrations-as a splendid example of Soviet children's literature. (The works of Samuel Marshak are also called to mind in this regard.) The poem: Autoanimals describes eight ani- mals-elephant, tortoise, ostrich, seal, giraffe, cuttlefish, kangaroo, horse-anthropomorph- ized to a high degree. Tretiakov attributes human emotional and social values to these creatures. For example, the tortoise is a good humored animal ("never bears a scowl") and the elephant has been brought up well ("coached/Not like people-but almost"). Each stanza is divided into two parts: the first is devoted to the animal itself and the second to a child's portrayal of that animal. Susan Cook Summer and Gail Harrison Roman Cinematic Whimsy: Rodchenko's Photo- Illustrationsfor Autoqnimals In 1926, Sergei Mikhailovich Tretiakov (1892- 1939) commissioned the artist Alexander Mik- hailovich Rodchenko (1891-1956) to design illustrations for a projected (but unrealized) book of his poem Autoanimals (Samozveri). In 1921, Rodchenko had turned from easel painting and sculpture to utilitarian, "produc- tivist" art: domestic design (furniture, clothing); typography (posters, publications); and pho- tography (photomontage, film titles). Through- out the 1920s, Rodchenko increasingly devoted his efforts to books, journals, posters, photog- raphy, and film titles. Above all, his book designs2 represent the dynamism and optimism inspired by the social, political, and cultural hopes of the young Soviet Union. Experimental book design3 in Russia dates from as early as 1910, but post-Revolutionary activity in the arts especially encouraged innovation and production. Rodchenko's book designs are both political and artistic. As chief designer for the avant- garde journals LEF and Novyi LEF, he produced covers, title pages, illustrations, and layouts, all of which show his enthusiasm for vanguard art forms as a manifestation of the new social and artistic organization of Soviet life.4 From his earliest association with LEF, Rod- chenko had experimented extensively with pho- tography.5 He introduced photomontage to the Soviet Union, and created film titles for the cinematographer Dziga Vertov (1896-1954). Tretiakov-himself a photographer-appre- ciated Rodchenko's photographic talents and chose him as the illustrator ofAutoanimals. For his projected illustrations, Rodchenko -along with his wife Varvara Stepanova- photographed cardboard cut-out figures that he had constructed in the form of the animals and children mentioned in the text (Figs. 1- 6). It seems highly possible that Rodchenko intended such pop-up figures to be the final illustrations for Autoanimals but that he was forced by economic stringencies to use photo- graphic illustrations instead. Such actual, three- dimensional designs would have accomplished Rodchenko's artistic goals of presenting the multiple viewpoints and heightened realism that are best achieved in cinematic art. The photographic medium provided him with an excellent alternative for achieving these goals. The reason for employing cut-out models instead of creating two-dimensional designs was to exploit the stark tonal effects resulting from the shadow reflections of the figures photographed in bright light. The sculptural, angular forms of the characters boldly challenge the two-dimensional quality of the book. The play of the shadows energizes the background and extends the book-page into a stage-like space. Furthermore, these works suggest cine- matic motion and dynamism as actual and silhouetted forms are relieved through tonal and dimensional contrasts with the background space. It was undoubtedly his experience with film design (titles, posters, books) that inspired Rodchenko to create such highly animated figures. The shadows of the animals and children echo their actual forms, thus suggesting their extension, or "movement," from the two-dimen- sional page to a potential three-dimensional portrayal. The elimination of unnecessary details and the use of silhouetted forms emphasize the elegant, simple geometry of the animals and children as their shadows form patterns on the background of the pages. Perhaps the excited animation described in the text motivated Rod- chenko to create these mechanically whimsical figures. Unlike Tretiakov, for whom Autoani- mals seems to represent a psychological and artistic respite from straightforward documen- tary works, Rodchenko employs for this project the same artistic devices that can be observed in his more agitational, productivist work in both typography and photography; he even adapted certain stylistic tendencies of his pre-utilitarian paintings and sculpture in these designs. The bold planar juxtapositions of the geo- metric forms-circles, cylinders, rectangles; curvilinear and straight-edged shapes-are drawn from the geometric abstraction that characterized Rodchenko's art during the pre-LEF years. The dynamic rhythm of his Compass-and-Ruler works and his experimen- tal sculpture6 reappear in the illustrations to "Autoanimals." The marvelous combination of geometric precision in the cut-out forms and the fantasy-shapes of the figures represent the whimsical abstraction developed by Rod- chenko earlier in the 1920s in film titles, advertising posters, and commercial logos.7 For example, in the logo for "News" reproduced here (Fig. 7), the precise, colored geometric shapes are relieved from their background surface by hard-edged contour and comple- mentary relationships (red-green). The geo- metric precision is repeated in the cut-out forms of the "Autoanimals," and the chromatic Fall 1981 245</page><page sequence="5">effects are analogous to the tonal contrasts- drawn also from black-and-white films-of Autoanimals. We wait anxiously for these charming figures to move as if they were made of sheet metal and hinged at the edges of each geometric section. Although it is only our mind that casts them into "animated narration," the cinematic effect is achieved. Finally, the varied planar perspectives, unusual viewpoints and dramatic chiaroscuro heighten our apprecia- tion of the forms themselves as well as of their narrative function. These effects also appear in Rodchenko's photographs8 (Figs. 8 and 9), and they represent in large measure the artist's attempts to re-form the spectator's visual ex- perience. In 1927 he wrote: ... one circles an object, a building, or a person and thinks: "How should I take this-this way, or that way or this way?" It's all outmoded. We have been educated, raised for thousands of years on a variety Fig. 7Alexander Rodchenko, titlefor News logo, 1924. of paintings, to see everything according to the compositional rules of our grand- mothers. But we must revolutionize people by making them see from all vantage points and in all lights.9 The photo-pictures designed by Rodchenko for Autoanimals both highlight and comple- ment Tretiakov's text. Rodchenko's "camera eye" animates the characters both emotionally and dynamically. These ingenious figures en- hance the whimsical nature and the entertain- ment value of the poem. The organic link between content and form in illustrated litera- ture dates back to Symbolism in Russia, as elsewhere. Rodchenko felt a special affinity for the works of Aubrey Beardsley (1872-1898) and Mikhail Vrubel (1856-1911), and the transformational effects of images and shadows in Autoanimals may well remind us of the works of these two Symbolist artists. Ultimately, Rodchenko's extension of the traditional bound- aries of art into a synthetic representation of two-dimensional photo-illustrations and three- dimensional cinematic effects has transformed en page the characters of Autoanimals into visionary emotive shapes that represent, among other things: the purposeful stride of the ele- phant, the graceful silliness of the giraffe, and the gleeful imitations by the children. 246 Art Journal Fig. 8 Alexander Rodchenko, Diving, photograph, 1936.
