Not a tree, a readily open to visualization. Why is this significant? spring, a rock or grotto, or a "genius of the brook" like the voice of The Lamentations of Round-Oak Waters (19).

The voice is partly disembodied but called attention to it in The Idea of Landscape and the Sense of not wholly so: it is not for example the voice of Echo, Place (1972), seeing here a dramatic monologue "spoken not whereby what is heard only seems to be the voice of nature by the genius of the place but by the place itself' in a "witty" while really belonging to the dead nymph (in Ovid, Metamor take-off of the persona of a dispossessed laborer (116-117). phoses, 3: 396) or, in the demythologized world, to the In Green Romanticism (2000), James McKusick, noted the human protagonist. There is of course the tradition of ek "radical innovation" of having the place speak for itself in phrasis, not mentioned in Puttenham but obsessive for the "one of the first and still one of the very few poems to speak aestheticians of the modern world, which can describe both for the Earth in such a direct and immediate way, adapting writing about a thing and making a thing speak.1 But it is still the rhetorical figure of prosopopoeia (attributing voice to in- a thing envisioned there, a bounded entity, like a painting, or animate objects) to a contemporary crisis of ecological aware- flower, or mountain.

Part of the pathos in the best of worids he wouid be properly contained: of the poem is that in its final stanza the speaking voice is particularized, contracted into a single field: And as the season of the year outwears&gt; And heaps of snow from off the mountain tops With sudden streams the valleys overflow, So did the time draw on my more despair; Then floods of sorrow and whole seas of woe The banks of all my hope did overbear , „ . . - , r . . ..

Personification is itself the symptom of the collapse: shelter, pasturage and building stone and timber. It built the Swordy Well's having to and being able to identify itself as very town that now destroys it (1. 70), by a three-stage process such is the primary evidence for the demise of unbounded of limitation and exploitation: "vile enclosure" (1. 184), over- place and its conversion into increasingly vulnerable locality, cropping, and quarrying. Its passage into speech and personi- Coleridge took up (briefly) the pantheist hypothesis whereby fication itself— all of animated nature might be an infinite series of "organic 132</page><page sequence="3">harps, diversely framed" ("The Aeolian Harp"), thus sensing the need to associate these equivalences with sounds that are not yet language, albeit by way of a man-made instrument. In Clare's poem, personification stands poised at and completes a moment of tragic transition from identity—"Im Swordy Well a piece of land"— to alienation, to the speaker's posses sion of "my bit of ground" (1. 77) as a thing apart from the voice that speaks. Ironically enough this happens when tell ing of a point (before enclosure) when others could be made free: "There was a time my bit of ground/Made freemen of the slave" (11. 77-78). Clare's extraordinary originality in giving voice to an unbounded place, thereby inventing a form of personifica tion unrecorded in rhetorical theory, is not then quite what it seems. The voice that speaks is already a diminished thing, finally a single "field" (1. 203) which the voice owns or pos sesses rather than being one with: "Of all the fields I am the last/That my own face can tell." It is a chilling moment, as I've said, because the telling (as recitation) that looks like a limited source of control is also a telling (as quantifying) that marks the speaker's inevitable compliance in the acts of weighing and measuring that have accompanied "vile enclo sure" itself. Reading back, the "piece of land" that seemed to speak for an imprecise extension can be read proleptically as a place already pieced, parceled out and fitted in. Saying this makes Clare a more fully "Romantic" poet, in the grand phil osophic sense, than he has often been taken to be. His poetic art here encompasses the sophisticated lapsarian conscious ness that associated with Blake or Schiller or Wordsworth, and it does so through the subtle register of his common lan guage rather than through the machinery of myth or of philosophy. The lapsarian moment, however, has little if anything to do with the fall of man, and everything to do with the greed and violence of men. It registers in various ways as a politics—aesthetic, philosophical, and national. It troubles the lexicon of inherited poetic figures by appearing to invent a new kind of personification which then turns out to have never quite existed as such. It thus addresses the larger de bate about personification which is still at the heart of con temporary ecocritical inquiry as it asks about the propriety of speaking for nature or having nature seem to speak for it self.5 Denying its parity with the locus amoenus or hortus in clusus, it proposes an Eden that never had a wall around it, and implicitly exposes the emerging culture of localism—the Lakes, the "sequestered nook," home at Grasmere and so on—as the product of radical limitation and despair. Aes thetic virtue comes to seem the result of political and eco nomic necessity. Philosophically, the brief imagining of an unbounded space that is yet made up of infinite particular things extended serially in all directions for all time postu lates a way of being in the world that does not differentiate man from nature and does not accord with the subjection of space-time to the Cartesian-Newtonian norms of disem bodied mathematical relations or of disaggregated Lockean primary and secondary qualities. It also makes clear that the alternative to the rationalist world-view is not the cozy and messy embeddedness of so much contemporary self-affiliation with place and commu nity (and this is something Clare's own poetry sometimes seems to claim), those things being unconvincing except as they are reinvented as part of latter-day myths of national in tegrity, now known also as the heritage industry. And in these ways there is here an inescapable address to national politics, both then and now. Geoffrey Hartman's perennially relevant essay "Romantic Poetry and the Genius Loci," which I have already mentioned, argued for a fully conscious eighteenth century awareness of the relation between personification and the national self-image. So it was not just a matter of wor rying about the pagan origins of nymphs and dryads, or of worrying over whether the material of poetry could survive the withering glance of enlightened reason, but also of find ing out whether a native poetry of place could image and project some sort of positive national destiny, thus offering its readers a glow of self-esteem and its authors a predictable living. Hartman proposed that these various concerns were combined and resolved in the model of a "new middle or georgic style" in which the pagan-demonic tradition was tamed by the even-tempered English milieu into a "cultic cel ebration of the English countryside" ( 319). If so, then Clare wrote the counter-argument, according to which there were no demons needing taming in the first place, and where the current English effort was directed at making a few men rich and many others poor, while refiguring and despoiling na ture as the raw material for rich men's wealth, depriving poorer men, animals and plants of the raw materials for mere existence. To inquire, as I have tried to do, into the mechanics of Clare's attitude to personification and his sense of its limits and possibilities is to open a new passageway into his art by way of art itself—a homage, I hope, to the rhetorical intelli gence and complexity of this apparently unschooled peasant poet who might not have pursued the difficult taxonomies distinguishing (or seeming to distinguish) metalepsis from catachresis or echo from ekphrasis, but who knew nonethe less a good deal about what was behind the tradition of per sonification itself in relation to nature, to the mind of man, and to man's various disobediences and their fruits.
