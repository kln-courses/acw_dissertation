<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jewish History Vol. 5, No. 2 Fall 1991 Reading Rambam: Approaches to the Interpretation of Maimonides Menachem Kellner I Middah ke-neged middah, says the Talmud (Sanh?drin 90a), is how human beings are rewarded and punished for their actions. "Measure for measure" is the way Shakespeare put it; either way, it is what has happened and is happening to Maimonides, and deservedly so. The Rabbis of the Mishnah and Talmud presented the heroes of the Bible as if they were rabbinic sages who spent most of their time in yeshivot and courts of Jewish law, devoting their spare time, as it were, to the wars and intrigues that so dominate their activities in the pages of the biblical story. Maimonides served the Rabbis in their own coin, presenting them essentially as philosophers of an Aristotelian mold, who cloaked their metaphysical concerns in aggadah so as not to upset or harm the uninitiated. It is only fair, then, that Maimonides himself be presented as everything from a late convert to Kabbalah to a halakhist, who in truth disdained philosophy, to an Aristotelian philosopher, whose own innermost thoughts stood in conscious opposition to normative Jewish teachings. There is a further sense in which the situation is both fair and appropriate. Maimonides was one of the few major medieval halakhic decisors to claim that laws derived by the rabbinic sages from the Bible through the use of the "thirteen principles of biblical exegesis" were rabbinic in their authority (d'rabbanan), that they did not derive their authority directly from the text of the Torah (d'oraita).1 What, then, was the point of the derivation from biblical texts? The biblical verses, Maimonides maintained, were used as an asmakhta, or prooftext, a kind of biblical hook on which to hang rabbinic law. Similarly, Maimonides is used as an asmakhta, a kind of medieval authority on which to base all manner of modern positions.2 The scholarly world in recent months has been treated to the publication of a spate of books offering different interpretations of Maimonides. These include Jacob Levinger's collection of his previously published studies on Maimonides,</page><page sequence="2">74 Menachem Kellner Ha-Rambam ke-Philosoph u-khe-Posek (Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1989); my own Maimonides on Human Perfection (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990); Leonard S. Kravitz's The Hidden Doctrine of Maimonides" Guide for the Perplexed (Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen Press, 1988); Oliver Leaman's Moses Maimonides, which appeared in the series Arabic Thought and Culture (London: Routledge, 1990); and, finally, Interpreting Maimonides (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990), by Marvin Fox, the Philip W. Lown Professor of Jewish Philosophy at Brandeis University.3 In this essay I consider Fox's book in some detail. But in order to understand its importance attention must be focused on the question of why Maimonides' writings have aroused such debate through the generations. I offer a new way of looking at one aspect of the Maimonidean controversies; I also suggest to historians who work in areas outside the pure history of ideas that attention to those ideas can be crucial to their work as historians. My point is that in following the details of the unfolding debates, in concentrating on the social roles of the protagonists, historians are in danger of losing sight of the fact that the debates were prompted by and usually focused on Maimonides' writings. Attention to these writings affords insights into aspects of the controversies that otherwise might be missed. The debate over what Maimonides said, over who in fact Maimonides was, and the use of Maimonides as an authority to justify all sorts of different religious and ideological positions is not a modern phenomenon. On the contrary, it began almost immediately with the publication of Maimonides' writings. These writings stimulated a long-festering and remarkably acrimonious debate about the proper relationship between revelation and reason throughout much of the Jewish High Middle Ages.4 Maimonides stood at the center of this debate partly because of his great authority. He had proved his bona fides as a master halakhist and communal leader before publishing his philosophic work, Guide of the Perplexed. Maimonides wrote the first running commentary on the entire Mishnah; he wrote the first compendium of the 613 commandments of the Torah that had a clear-cut rationale; most important, he wrote the first comprehensive code of Jewish law and organized it on logical lines. His was a masterful personality, he had influence at court, and he headed a great Jewish community. Maimonides thus was known and highly respected throughout much of the Jewish world before the publication of the Guide of the Perplexed. Why, then, did his writings stimulate such debate? Scholars have pointed to two main reasons. The first has to do with esotericism. Near the opening of the Guide of the Perplexed Maimonides advertised his intent to write in ways that hid his true views from the unworthy: In speaking about very obscure matters it is necessary to conceal some parts and to disclose others. Sometimes in the case of certain dicta this necessity requires that</page><page sequence="3">Reading Rambam 75 the discussion proceed on the basis of a certain premise, whereas in another place necessity requires that the discussion proceed on the basis of another premise contradicting the first one. In such cases the vulgar must in no way be aware of the contradiction; the author accordingly uses some device to conceal it by all means.5 Maimonides further advertises his intent in the introduction to the third part of the Guide, which opens with a discussion of ma'aseh merkavah, the most obscure of the "secrets of the Torah": I shall interpret to you that which was said by Ezekiel the prophet, peace be on him, in such a way that anyone who heard that interpretation would think that I do not say anything over and beyond what is indicated by the text. ... On the other hand, if that interpretation is examined with a perfect care by him for whom this Treatise is composed and has understood all its chapters - every chapter in its turn - the whole matter, which has become clear and manifest to me, will become clear to him so that nothing in it will remain hidden from him.6 With these statements Maimonides precipitated a cottage industry in Jewish intellectual circles, and has kept his interpreters busy ever since for close to a millennium. He also invited debate over his meaning and turned himself into a hook on which a bewildering array of opinions have been hung.7 Heterodox ideas were attributed to Maimonides during his lifetime8 and for generations after his death. But Maimonides became a focus of debate for more important historical reasons. One of these is well known and has been subjected to concentrated scholarly and theological scrutiny: because of who he was and what he wrote, Maimonides forced Jews to attend to the question of the place of reason and revelation in their faith. The resulting debate has been interpreted by scholars as a conflict over the place of rationalism in Judaism and as reflecting socio-economic battles within the Jewish community.9 There is, however, another, even more important, reason for the ongoing debate about Maimonides - one that has been overlooked by most scholars. Simply put, whether Maimonides intended it or whether it was clearly understood by those who argued over his writings,10 the cumulative effect of his teachings was to undermine the authority of the rabbis as a class, in particular, the authority they exercised in matters that extended beyond the narrowly legal.11 I do not mean that Maimonides consciously or unconsciously attempted to "subvert the dominant rabbinic oligarchy, to undermine the influence of an insensitive, seemingly entrenched, religious establishment which lorded it over its charges." In this view, "the popularization of halakha through the Mishneh Torah, the conversion of Jewish law from an esoteric to an exoteric discipline, would threaten the exclusive authority of the rabbinic leadership class. Its judicial role would be usurped by increasingly learned members of other classes, and the hierarchical structure of the community, which had come under attack for various reasons, would collapse."12</page><page sequence="4">76 Menachem Kellner Maimonides may or may not have had such a political goal in mind when he wrote the Mishneh Torah and his other books; he is silent on the subject, and therefore we have no way of knowing. I am suggesting something different here: one of the consequences of Maimonides' writings, taken as a whole, is the undermining of the intellectual, as opposed to the social and economic, authority of rabbinic scholars and halakhic decisors as such. Many aspects of Maimonides' literary activity encourage intellectual independence and argue against the notion that rabbinic erudition, whether modest or vast, bears authority in non-halakhic spheres.13 Maimonides' commentary on the Mishnah sought to open that text as never before, explaining its reasoning and conclusions so that it could be used a source of Jewish law.14 One of the most popular sections of the commentary is the eight-part introduction to Tractate Avot. In his introductory remarks to this text Maimonides insists that one should accept the truth, whatever its source.15 His argument is with individuals who reject an idea because its author is in some way unacceptable. This is implicitly a negative argument against authority: Maimonides is arguing against the notion of an "anti-authority," an individual whose views must be rejected because of who he or she is,16 just as a religious authority is an individual whose views must be accepted because of who he or she is.17 The Mishneh Torah, as claimed by some of its supporters, potentially freed Jews from dependence on rabbis for all matters of standard Halakhah.18 But more than that, Maimonides tells us that part of his goal is to free Jews from the need to devote their lives to Talmud study. He planned that no other work should be needed for ascertaining any of the laws of Israel, but that this work might serve as a compendium of the entire Oral Law ... [such] that a person who first reads the Written Law and then this compilation, will know from it the whole of the Oral Law, without needing to consult any other other book between them.19 It is likely that Maimonides intended by this dramatic and revolutionary statement to free Jews who had already achieved a high level of Talmudic erudition to move on to the study of Torah in its truest and deepest sense, namely, metaphysics.20 Be that as it may, the upshot of his position was in effect to remove from the heart of the Jewish curriculum the one arena in which rabbis are the undisputed masters: Talmud.21 In both the Mishneh Torah and the Guide of the Perplexed Maimonides subtly restricts the authority of the Sages of the Talmud. He sharply distinguishes their role as transmitters of the Sinaitic revelation from their role as individuals reporting on their own ideas and interpretations, or reporting on the best science of their day. Thus, regarding questions concerning the coming of the Messiah, Maimonides writes: Some of our Sages say that the coming of Elijah will precede the advent of the Messiah. But no one is in a position to know the details of this and similar things</page><page sequence="5">Reading Rambam 77 until they have come to pass. They are not explicitly stated by the Prophets. Nor have the Rabbis any tradition with regard to these matters. They are guided solely by what the scriptural texts seem to imply. Hence there is a divergence of opinion upon the subject.22 In describing the messianic world, then, the Sages are simply interpreting biblical verses as best they can. In effect, Maimonides is saying that their interpretations carry no more authority than our own. In two places in the Guide Maimonides tells us that the Rabbis of the Talmud erred in matters of science. In II.8 (Pines, p. 267) and III. 15 (p. 459) Maimonides explicitly attributes such error to the Sages, saying in the second passage: Do not ask me to show that everything they [the Sages] have said concerning astronomical matters conforms to the way things really are. For at that time mathematics were imperfect. They did not speak about this as transmitters of the dicta of the prophets, but rather because in those times they were men of knowledge in those fields or because they had heard these dicta from the men of knowledge who lived in those times. I am certain that Maimonides did not mean to be overtly revolutionary. But let us examine the upshot of his claim. We must follow the dicta of the Sages, Maimonides tells us, when they transmit Halakhah; not when they interpret the Bible or teach science. If the authority of the Sages of the Talmud is restricted in this way, how much more so the authority of contemporary rabbinic scholars! Another passage in the Guide was understood by its medieval readers as explicitly undercutting the authority and standing of Talmudists. In his famous "parable of the palace" (Guide 111.51) Maimonides seems to be disparaging experts in rabbinics vis-?-vis experts in the physical and metaphysical sciences.23 Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov cites what appears to have been a fairly typical reaction to the parable: Many rabbinic scholars said that Maimonides did not write this chapter and if he did write it, it ought to be hidden away or, most appropriately, burned. For how could he say that those who know physics are on a higher level than those who engage in religion, and even more that they are with the ruler in the inner chamber, for on this basis the philosophers who are engaged with physics and metaphysics have achieved a higher level than those who are immersed in Torah!24 These various ways in which Maimonides' writings tend toward the limitation of rabbinic authority are best summarized in a well-known letter of his. Commenting on the dicta of certain Talmudic Sages who affirmed astrology, Maimonides wrote: Similarly, it is not proper to abandon matters of reason that have already been verified by proofs, shake loose of them, and depend on the words of a single one of the sages from whom possibly the matter was hidden. Or there may be an allusion in those words; or they may have been said with a view to the times and business before him. ... A man should never cast his reason behind him, for the eyes are set in front, not in back.25</page><page sequence="6">78 Menachem Kellner One must never give up one's reason and rely upon the authority of another.26 This call to intellectual independence is the leitmotif of Maimonides' work as a whole and finds expression in one way or another on almost every page he wrote.27 But rabbinic scholars as a class must find this threatening, especially when their own rule is challenged. The danger of Maimonideanism,28 then, as it must have been perceived, if even only inchoately, by the rabbis of his day, is not only that Maimonides adopts a universalistic conception of Judaism29 and imports a gentile philosophy into the very heart of the faith,30 but that his approach to life and Torah undermines rabbinic authority, especially of those rabbis who insist on the basis of their mastery of rabbinic literature that they have the right to determine Jewish theology and politics. Analyzing the social roles of the dominant figures in the various debates over the writings of Maimonides in the High Middle Ages supports my reading of rabbinic response to Maimonides. With few exceptions those who took what can in broad terms be called anti-philosophical positions were authoritative rabbinic scholars or their followers; similarly, almost without exception, those who defended the Maimonides who called upon us never to forget that our eyes are set in the front of our heads were intellectuals with neither formal nor informal rabbinic authority. This demands a bit more explanation. Aviezer Ravitzky has drawn our attention to the existence of a self-conscious school of Jewish philosophers founded by Samuel ibn Tibbon (died ca. 1232), the translator of Maimonides' Guide.31 Members of this school saw themselves as engaged in a joint project - a project that distinguished them from their more traditionally oriented contemporaries. That project was the furthering of rationalist values and teachings. These individuals saw themselves as good and faithful Jews (indeed, as the best and most faithful of all Jews), and as such devoted their time to scientific and philosophical studies, leaving halakhic matters to the halakhists. Philosophical studies were so important to them that they often ignored their more traditional rabbinic studies, betraying without shame their ignorance of basic matters. Opposed to the intellectuals were traditionalist scholars, those whom I have here called "rabbis," who may not have opposed philosophy per se, but certainly insisted that Jews devote the lion's share of the time available to the study (and implementation) of halakhic texts.32 The issue may be better understood if we cast it in the following terms. After his death, Maimonides' followers ranged themselves into two opposing camps. The "halakhic" Maimonideans - those for whom the Rambam of the Mishneh Torah was crucial, who viewed Maimonides as fitting without difficulty into the line of halakhic decisors beginning, in effect, with Moses and continuing to them and through them to their disciples and descendants - were opposed by the "philosophic" Maimonideans. Such thirteenth-century and fourteenth-century figures as Samuel ibn Tibbon, Jacob Anatoli, Zerahiah ben Shealtiel Hen, Isaac Albalag, Moses of Salerno, and Shem Tov ibn Falaquera come to mind. These men</page><page sequence="7">Reading Rambam 79 were to a large extent part of a self-consciously defined group sharing a common intellectual agenda, including the writing of philosophy in Hebrew (unknown before the time of Samuel ibn Tibbon), the translation of scientific texts into Hebrew, and the philosophical interpretation of Scripture (often presented esoterically).33 These "philosophic" Maimonideans were further characterized by their appreciation of the high level of intellectual sophistication among the gentiles (and not among the Jews, as Samuel ibn Tibbon often complained),34 by their relatively low level of halakhic erudition, and by their feeling that they were a tiny saving remnant swimming in a sea of ignoramuses.35 These individuals, who, in their own eyes at least, were intellectuals (maskilei ha-muskalot) in the strictest sense of the term, were loath to accept the authority of rabbis as such. In this (correctly, I have tried to show), they were following in the footsteps of Maimonides. The rabbis, the halakhic Maimonideans, like their intellectualist opponents, the philosophic Maimonideans, were also part of a defined group sharing a common intellectual agenda. The main authorities for this group were other rabbis - heads of courts, halakhic decisors, and authors of works of rabbinic scholarship. Those who opposed Maimonides, or, more accurately, those who opposed the social consequences of his philosophical teachings, were not necessarily aware of the points I have adduced here, but they certainly seemed to realize that they were faced with a very serious threat. That complex of historical phenomena known as the "Maimonidean controversy" was an event of major social and political significance, shaking the Jewish communities of Spain, Provence, and even France for well over one hundred years. I have tried to suggest here that historians who focus on the events themselves or see them primarily in terms of "class struggle" or as a reflection of a debate over particularism and universalism in Judaism, but who ignore Maimonides' writings themselves, will in the end at best see and present only a partial picture.36 In the second part of this essay I examine in detail a book that illuminates Maimonides' writings in important ways and stakes out a position in the Maimonidean controversy. n It is the great merit of Marvin Fox's Interpreting Maimonides that it focuses our attention precisely on the Maimonides whose writings so upset the rabbis of his and later generations. This is not the radical Maimonides presented by readers who understand him as a self-conscious heretic, hiding his true views behind a cloak of insincere orthodoxy. Had Maimonides' rabbinic contemporaries and near contemporaries understood him thus, there would have been no controversy. He</page><page sequence="8">80 Menachem Kellner would have been anathematized altogether, or, at the very least, ignored. Much of Fox's book is given to refuting this reading of Maimonides. The Maimonides presented by Fox is deeply convinced that one must master the Torah before going on to science and philosophy - but go on one must. This Maimonides insists on the freedom to explore ideas, affirming that it is the truth that counts, and that it is the truth that must be accepted, no matter what its source. This Maimonides uses philosophical texts to interpret Scripture and Midrash; and this Maimonides explicitly rejects the idea that a person's role or position, no matter how exalted, has any bearing on the truth or falsity of what that person says. Historians seeking to understand what it was about Maimonides' writings that so offended so many people are expertly guided by Fox through these tangled thickets. Marvin Fox presents his Maimonides in contrast to the Maimonides of Leo Strauss. In our century Leo Strauss gave renewed impetus to the old questions, Who really is Maimonides and what did he mean to say? In a series of gnomic studies, illuminated by flashes of brilliance, Strauss forcefully reminded the scholarly world of what it should never have forgotten: the Guide of the Perplexed is an esoteric work and may not be taken at face value.37 Strauss apparently felt that what Maimonides wished to keep hidden he, Leo Strauss, had no right to make public, and so he kept his understanding of Maimonides' secret doctrine obscure. Having been reminded that Maimonides had a secret doctrine, scholars have set to work seeking to determine what it is.38 An example of this is useful here. Throughout his writings, both halakhic and philosophic, Maimonides presents a doctrine, that, if not surprising in Aristotelian terms, is surprising in traditional Jewish terms: human perfection consists of nothing other than perfection of the intellect, which, in turn, consists of nothing other than a high degree of competence in metaphysics. Practical perfection (observance of the commandments, moral behavior) is at most a necessary propadeutic for intellectual perfection. At the very end of the Guide of the Perplexed, however, Maimonides seems to reject this intellectualist framework, closing the book with the following: It is clear that the perfection of man that may truly be gloried in is the one acquired by him who has achieved, in a measure corresponding to his capacity, apprehension of Him, may He be exalted, and who knows His providence extending over His creatures as manifested in the act of bringing them into being and their governance as it is. The way of life of such an individual, after he has achieved this apprehension, will always have in view loving-kindness, righteousness, and judgment, through assimilation to His actions, may He be exalted, just as we have explained several times in this treatise.39 What is to be made of this? Is Maimonides suddenly abandoning his intellectualist perception of human behavior and substituting a call for practical perfection in the world? If so, what form must this practical perfection take? Many scholars hold on to the intellectualist interpretation of human perfection, explaining this passage in various ways.40</page><page sequence="9">Reading Rambam 81 Others affirm that the call for a practical imitatio Dei in the passage just quoted must be understood as normative for any interpretation of Maimonides' views on human perfection. These scholars are divided into three groups. Hermann Cohen, Julius Guttmann, and Steven Schwarzschild are the most prominent representatives of the trend in Maimonidean interpretation that holds that the way in which humans satisfy the call to practical perfection is through moral behavior. Shlomo Pines launched a frontal attack on the intellectualist reading of Maimonides, discerning in Maimonides' work an esoteric doctrine, according to which the sort of intellectual perfection ordinarily thought to be the supreme purpose of human life is actually impossible. He was thus led to affirm that the best life is the practical life. Together with his student Lawrence Berman, Pines developed a Straussian reading of Maimonides, according to which the best life is one of political leadership. Isadore Twersky, David Hartman, Shalom Rosenberg, and I have proposed that according to Maimonides one imitates God by obeying His commandments after and in conjunction with achieving the highest level possible of intellectual perfection.41 We have before us, then, a four-way debate concerning Maimonides' true views on a single issue: human perfection. Multiplying by the many issues (creation, immortality, freedom of the will, providence, etc., etc.) about which there is debate concerning Maimonides' true views, one quickly sees how complex the thicket of Maimonidean hermeneutics is! Attention to questions of Maimonidean hermeneutics is one of the strongest aspects of Marvin Fox's Interpreting Maimonides. To properly appreciate his achievement, it is useful to make some comments about the work of Kravitz and Leaman, cited at the beginning of this essay. There are two widely accepted ways of viewing Maimonides. One may be called vertical; the other, horizontal. In the first view, Maimonides is situated in a chain of Jewish tradition stretching back to Moses, and is seen primarily as a halakhic decisor. It is primarily in this tradition that Maimonides' views are studied and understood. In the second view, Maimonides is located in the context of contemporary or near-contemporary Muslim philosophy, and it is in relation to thinkers like al-Farabi that his views are studied and understood. Kravitz and Leaman each view Maimonides in horizontal terms, treating Maimonides in absolute isolation from his rabbinic context.42 In this they have been decisively influenced by Strauss, Pines, and Berman.43 But beyond this, their books are very different. Kravitz presents Maimonides as a more or less orthodox Aristotelian and a radically heterodox Jew. Leaman, on the other hand, refutes Straussian esoteric readings of Maimonides. His Maimonides has an esoteric teaching, but that teaching is not heterodox (at least not according to Maimonides himself); it is esoteric because it might damage the faith of the unlearned and</page><page sequence="10">82 Menachem Kellner unsophisticated. Maimonides the philosopher does not reject Maimonides the rabbi; instead, Maimonides the philosopher is a more sophisticated version of Maimonides the rabbi. The correct interpretation, in my opinion, is that Maimonides must be understood as standing at the nexus of both vectors, the vertical one stretching back to Moses and the horizontal one encompassing his philosophical contemporaries and near contemporaries. Maimonides was convinced that one could and must live simultaneously in both these worlds.44 Although flawed, Fox's book nevertheless makes a fundamental contribution to Maimonidean study. Research in the humanities in general, and in philosophy and the history of philosophy in particular, is a frustrating affair: one rarely gets the impression that true progress has been made. Academic fashions come and go, but the same issues seem to be debated over and over and the same positions maintained. I remember how exciting it was for me to read Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion for the first time; I may have been naive, but I truly felt that concrete philosophical progress had been made and that the cosmological argument for God's existence had been refuted once and for all. In the narrow field and rarified atmosphere of Maimonidean scholarship, Fox's Interpreting Maimonides represents a similar solid step forward: never again will interpreters of Maimonides be able to facilely follow Strauss in reading Maimonides esoterically on the basis of contradictions that are not contradictions. Never again will responsible interpreters of the Guide, such as Strauss, Pines, Berman, and Leaman, be able to present readings of the text that ignore the rabbinic context of so many of its passages, as Fox convincingly demonstrates (pp. 155, 185, 191, 263, and 317). Moreover, as good as Fox is with the rabbinic background, he is equally thorough with the philosophical context, reading Maimonides together with Aristotle, for example, on ethics45 and with Aquinas on natural law. His discussions may or may not convince the reader, but they are always lucid, provocative, and sharply focused. Fox also deals with what Maimonides actually said, not with what he would have liked him to say. Finally, he presents us with a cogent new reading of Maimonides. My major criticism o? Interpreting Maimonides may strike readers as picayune: Fox writes with a seemingly Olympian detachment. He largely ignores the work of other scholars, including those with whom he both agrees and disagrees;46 and he presents controversial readings of Maimonides without indicating that they are controversial. His ignoring other scholars is all the more peculiar, since much of the book consists of articles written by him over many years (the oldest is 25 years old).47 These articles, in many cases, have been criticised by Fox's colleagues - some fairly, some unfairly, some on the mark, some off the mark. The reader of the book, however, would never know this from the book, for none of it is alluded to, even obliquely.</page><page sequence="11">Reading Rambam 83 To illustrate: the first part of Interpreting Maimonides takes up issues of methodology: Of the four chapters in this section, the third and fourth, on Strauss's esoteric method and on "contradictions" in the Guide, are brilliant, concrete advances. As presented by Fox, Strauss posits the following rule for reading Maimonides: "We may therefore establish the rule that of two contradictory statements in the Guide or in any other work of Maimonides that statement which appears less frequently, or even which occurs only once, was considered by him to be true" (p. 70). Strauss reads Maimonides esoterically; he also writes about him esoterically, using hints, allusions, contradictions, misstatements, etc. In a remarkable tour de force Fox presents a Straussian reading of Strauss's introduction to Pines's translation of the Guide ("How to Begin to Read the Guide of the Perplexed"). Fox concludes that Strauss's reading of Maimonides, "with all its brilliance and ingenuity, [does] little to advance the cause of sound understanding, even for readers who are well prepared and sophisticated" (p. 62) (including, of course, Fox himself)- In effect, Strauss consigns Maimonides' work "to a dimension so deeply hidden from access, even to the most thoughtful and intelligent readers, that he is effectively lost to us" (p. 63). Out-Straussing Strauss on Strauss, Fox is convincing, even amusing. Strauss is Fox's target again in chapter 4. Strauss assumes that Maimonides, in his notorious "seventh cause" (above, n. 4), is speaking of contradictions between statements. Fox shows that in each of Strauss's examples what we have is not a contradiction between statements, but a "divergence" between a statement, on the one hand, and an imperative or commandment, on the other. In such a case we are not faced with a contradiction that forces us to choose one assertion or the other. In cases where there actually are contradictions between statements, Fox shows that the subject of these statements is invariably God. But statements of this nature are "singular propositions," and do not fall under any of the categories of classical logic. The learned "understand that discourse about God is not limited by the known rules of logic and that there may well be cases where it is permissible, even necessary, to affirm seemingly inconsistent propositions in which the subject is 'God' " (p. 82). Fox's point here is that Maimonides, anticipating Kant, understood that what is called "God talk" today cannot by its nature be philosophically clean "... once we come to talk about God, we no longer have the concepts and the controls for philosophical clarity and reliability" (p. 83). But we simply cannot do away with talk about God. We therefore engage in rational, philosophical discourse as far as it will carry us, knowing full well that there are objective limitations to what we can know and understand. This nuanced approach underlies Fox's characterization of Maimonides. As I have already noted, one of the crucial strengths of Interpreting Maimonides is its clear, consistent, and to a great extent convincing picture of Maimonides the man and thinker. This picture falls rather naturally into two parts: the first characterizes</page><page sequence="12">84 Menachem Kellner Maimonides the believer; the second, Maimonides the believer in his approach to philosophical problems. Maimonides the believer insists that philosophical investigation be taken as far as it can go, but in the final analysis, at certain critical points, one must fall back on faith in Mosaic prophecy (pp. 86, 143). Maimonides, Fox insists, "learned much from Aristotle, but even more from the Torah." He was "one of the most enlightened philosophers of his age, and at the same time an uncompromisingly faithful Jew" (p. 123). This is reflected in his ethics. Ethical judgments, Fox's Maimonides maintains, are like esthetic judgments, neither true nor false, depending, in the final analysis, on taste and convention. To avoid social chaos we must appeal to a standard beyond ourselves. This standard is the Torah (p. 151). Fox presents Maimonides as holding that the Torah stands at the center, and all other disciplines at the circumference; they "assume their true importance only in relation to Torah learning" (p. 333; see also p. 335). Fox presents this fairly conventional view of Maimonidean orthodoxy very well; but there is nothing really new here. What is new, and important, is his explanation of how Maimonides the believer approaches philosophical problems. Maimonides, for Fox, does not seek a facile harmonization between opposing extremes; nor does he feel forced to choose one extreme over the other, since, in many cases they both have much to recommend them. We are often faced with opposing views, each of which has so much to recommend it that we are forced to "commit ourselves to both and hold them in balanced dialectical tension." Instead of "either/or" we have "both/and," with "the elements penetrating each other as far as legitimately possible and being held in a balanced tension when necessary (p. 23). An example of this approach is Fox's account of Maimonides' views on divine causality (chapter 9). Maimonides is faced with three models: physical, metaphysical, and religious. In the first model, God is the efficient cause of the world; in the second, God is the ultimate underlying ground of all explanations of the existence and order of the cosmos; in the third, God freely creates the universe out of nothing. Fox shows how for Maimonides each of these models is in some sense crucial for our understanding of the universe, while in another it is lacking. Rejecting the "safe but stupid" option of adopting one and rejecting the other two, Maimonides chooses, "in this instance as in many others, the far more difficult way of living with the tension between the philosophic/scientific view of the world, on the one hand, and the Torah/religious view, on the other. Each has its convincing aspects, and each has its limitations." The lesson taught by Maimonides is that "the price one pays for choosing to be both a philosopher and a Jew is that one must sometimes affirm the theses of both in the fullness of their tense opposition" (p. 249). Many readers may find such a view of Maimonides insulting to the "Great Eagle," as he was often called in the Middle Ages. Fox seems to be presenting him as a thinker who is incapable of making hard choices. To my mind this approach is facile. Although I am not convinced that Fox is correct (it is likely that Maimonides</page><page sequence="13">Reading Rambam 85 really thought that his synthesis was successful), his interpretation is not incoherent, simplistic, or insulting to Maimonides. Fox's Maimonides also adopts the "both/and" approach regarding the question of creation versus eternity (chapter 10), affirming "the truth of each up to a point and in a restricted context" (p. 293), and accepting "part of each while rejecting another part" (p. 294). According to Fox, Maimonides' views on prayer (chapter 11) follow the same pattern: they take account of "diverse intellectual and spiritual contexts" and represent "a balanced dialectical unification and tension of opposed elements" (p. 297). Our human condition, Fox presents Maimonides as saying, "leaves us no option but to live in the precarious situation in which we affirm and pursue in practice both a philosophically sophisticated conception of divine worship and a popular conventional pattern of prayer" (p. 319). Fox summarizes this view of Maimonides as follows: The way of Maimonides is to keep the old and the new in balance. It is characterized by deep and abiding loyalty to the received tradition while maintaining full interest in and regard for the achievements and the problems, the certainties and the doubts, of contemporary society. It is uncompromising in its adherence to the teachings of the classical Jewish tradition while being fully open to whatever is good and true in contemporary thought. It preserves the long established verities of the past, but seeks to illuminate them through the perspective of the best of the world in which we ourselves live. This way does not sacrifice the past to the present or the present to the past. As we have seen, Maimonides' way is not the method of superficial synthesis that tends to be merely cosmetic rather than substantive. Rather, it is the way of dialectical tension, the conscious achievement of a delicate balance between the old and the new, the traditional and the contemporary [pp. 324-25]. Fox takes care to distinguish his view from that of Sara Klein-Braslavy, one of the few contemporary interpreters of Maimonides of whom he takes note. Klein-Braslavy holds that in the end Maimonides suspended judgment in the matter of creation versus eternity, engaging in what the phenomenologists call epoche.48 But the only argument that Fox advances against Klein-Braslavy's carefully worked out view that Maimonides took no position49 is that there is "something inherently unconvincing in the notion that Maimonides invested so much energy, passion, and intellect in dealing with this question, only to arrive at no conclusion" (p. 292). I find Fox's response here "inherently unconvincing." If Klein-Braslavy's work is as well done as Fox says it is (and it most assuredly is), it deserves a more serious and sustained response than this. Chapter 6, "The Nature of Man and the Foundations of Ethics: A Reading of Guide, I, 1-2" was not previously published. Perhaps, therefore, it is fitting that just this chapter encapsulates both the strengths and weaknesses of Interpreting Maimonides. It is an extended philosophical (as opposed to philological and historical) commentary on the first two chapters of the Guide; it is detailed, careful,</page><page sequence="14">86 Menachem Kellner nuanced, sensitive, lively in style, crystal-clear in exposition, a marvelous piece of work. That, of course, does not mean that Fox is correct in his interpretations. But, once again, Fox almost completely ignores other scholars, presenting his interpretations as though they were canonically unassailable.50 Fox is absolutely on the mark when he connects the "foundations of ethics" to "the nature of man." We cannot know what a proper human life is until we know what a human life is supposed to be. The goal and end of human life, according to Fox's rather standard Maimonides, is perfection of the intellect.51 This being so, other forms of perfection must take a back seat to perfection of the intellect. As a candidate for other forms of perfection Fox examines only morality.52 The ethics of Maimonides, Fox insists over and over, is noncognitivist. That is, ethical judgments are like esthetic judgments; in the final analysis, they are matters of taste alone. Moral distinctions cannot be known by the intellect, and while moral dictates may be reasonable or unreasonable, they cannot be rational or irrational. "Reason tells us nothing about good and bad" (p. 189); it provides no grounds for moral principles. "Since moral rules are noncognitive, they cannot be true or false and therefore cannot be the concern of the intellect" (p. 190). There is a lot riding on Fox's insistence on this distinction. If ethics (and, by extension, Halakhah) is noncognitive, then Fox can present Maimonides as being a halakhic positivist. Halakhah is thus freed from any possible confrontation with any outside system, be it ethics, history, science, or philosophy. Since both Steven Schwarzschild and Hermann Cohen before him argued against this position, they should not have been ignored,53 however right Fox may be. Moreover, part of Fox's argument is the claim that for Maimonides the truly human life is the life of the intellect, that intellectual perfection is the highest aim of human endeavor. Fox reaches this interpretation, which he acknowledges is rendered problematic by the last few sentences in the Guide,54 because he does not follow his own analysis far enough. As noted above, he is correct in connecting the foundations of ethics to the nature of humankind. But how do we define humankind, at least in ideal terms? The answer is provided by the concept of imitatio Dei, an idea central to Maimonidean ethics (and here I think that Schwarzschild is more right than Fox), and even more, to Maimonides' ideas concerning human nature. Medieval Jewish philosophy arose as the result of a perceived conflict between two sources of truth: reason and revelation. One of the most fundamental ways in which these two sources of authority were seen to conflict related to the nature of God. The "God of the Philosophers" is essentially inactive and impersonal. This holds true for the God of Aristotle, the "unmoved mover" of an uncreated world, engrossed wholly in contemplation of itself, and even for the God of Neoplatonism, which creates automatically, involving no will or choice. On the other hand, the "God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," the God of medieval Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, is essentially active and personal. This God creates, rewards, provides, punishes, hears prayer, and redeems. In short, the</page><page sequence="15">Reading Rambam 87 God of Western medieval religion is always active, always involved, always accessible. Medieval religious and philosophic traditions agreed (not always explicitly) that God, the most perfect existent, is the ultimate model for human emulation. This doctrine was more clearly expressed in the religious sphere - as the doctrine of imitado Dei - but it underlay philosophic conceptions as well.55 If God is active in the world, then to emulate God is to adopt a life of activity in the world. If God is essentially inactive, busy contemplating the most perfect possible entity (God), then to emulate God means to withdraw from active involvement in the world to contemplate, to the extent that one is able, that most perfect possible entity (God). The question that must be asked then is whether the God of Maimonides is essentially contemplative and inactive, or essentially active. If the latter, then the intellectualist account of human perfection that Fox presents throughout his book cannot be correct. This is not the place to argue the point, but from what I have said here, it is clear that there are positions other than Fox's. This is the sort of thing I had in mind when I said that Fox presents his controversial interpretations of Maimonides without revealing their controversiality.56 I would like to close my discussion with an analysis of one of the themes of Fox's last chapter, "The Significance of Maimonides for Contemporary Judaism." This will allow us to close the circle, placing Fox's work more firmly in the context of the history and problematics of Maimonidean interpretation. In this chapter, Fox the man comes out more clearly than anywhere else in the book. A number of years ago, when David Hartman published his Maimonides: Torah and Philosophic Quest,51 it was dismissed by one reviewer as a book that teaches us much about Modern Orthodox Judaism and nothing about Maimonides. This is both absurd and unfair; yet, I suspect, the same sort of claim will be made about Fox's book because of this last chapter.58 In it, Fox takes up the cudgels for the ancient Maimonidean debate, arguing against contemporaries who, like some of their medieval forbears, reject Maimonidean positions because of their implicitly anti-authoritarian stance.59 Fox's Maimonides (and Maimonides himself!) emphasizes substance over form (arguing, in effect, that while the narratives and commandments of the Torah are of great importance, the deeper philosophical meaning of the Torah is of much greater importance), insists that the search for truth must be open (demanding that the truth be accepted no matter what its source), legitimizes non-Jewish sources of knowledge (using Aristotle and al-Farabi, for example, to interpret A vot), interprets Scripture according to the criteria of reason (thus rejecting anthropomorphism and adopting highly philosophical views concerning prophecy, providence, immortality and other crucial religious issues), and balances all this with a "deep conviction that no study of philosophical or scientific matters is appropriate until one has mastered the classical disciplines of Torah study" (p. 331), if only because, as Maimonides himself insists, one cannot</page><page sequence="16">88 Menachem Kellner hope to master metaphysics before one has mastered himself or herself, and there is no better way to do that than to obey the Torah. The first half of this agenda grows out of a sincere commitment to unfettered philosophical study; as such, it underlies the implicit anti-authoritarianism in Maimonides' writings that the first half of this essay examined. This is what makes Fox's Maimonides so dangerous: insisting that he is within the rabbinic system (and perforce accepted as such), he nonetheless undermines the authority of rabbis. Yet, is not Fox's admirable polemic addressed to people who will never read his book, and who, were they to read it, would reject much of its content, determinedly sidestepping Maimonides' admonition to accept the truth whatever its source, instead evaluating statements primarily by judging their sayers, rather than their objective truth or falsity? It would appear, then, that there really is nothing new under the sun. Fox speaks in the idiom of the twentieth century, but the underlying argument dates at least to the time of Maimonides. Interpreting Maimonides, therefore, is more than fine scholarship, it is also an engaged and engaging link in a centuries' old debate, one about the very nature of Judaism itself, as well as about the kinds of authority to which it and the communities of its devotees should submit.</page><page sequence="17">Reading Rambam 89 NOTES I would like to thank the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture for a research fellowship that helped support the writing of this essay. My colleagues Daniel J. Lasker and Maurice Kriegel were most generous with their criticism of earlier drafts of this essay. I am very grateful to them. 1. This is presented and defended by Maimonides in the second of the fourteen principles with which he prefaces his Book of Commandments. 2. To give just one example, Maimonides is cited as an authority by those who favor territorial negotiations between Israel and the Arabs, as well as those who reject the idea out of hand. 3.

In our day he has been adopted by the Lubavitcher Hassidim as one of their own, while at the same time being hailed by most leaders of Liberal Jewry as a precursor of Reform. In the Middle Ages kabbalists called him one of their own, as did Karaites. For the former, see Michael E. Shmidman, "On Maimonides' 'Conversion' to Kabbalah," in I. Twersky, ed., Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature 2 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984), 375-86; for the latter, see Daniel J.

For details, see the first note to Saperstein's article (above, n. 4). 10. Almost all of whom, it should be noted, held themselves to be his disciples - such was the hold he had over the minds of Jewish intellectuals. On this "heroic" image of Maimonides, see Septimus, Hispano-Jewish Culture in Transition, 46. 11. In "Ha-Rambam, Hanhagat Ish ha-Ru'ah," Retzef u-Temurah (Tel Aviv : Am Oved, 1984): 301-15, Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson argues that in his debates with contemporary geonim Maimonides was self-consciously rebelling against institutionalized rabbinic authority. My point here is that Maimonides' life and writings add up to an argument against the notion of intellectual authority as such. In support of Ben-Sasson* s thesis, by the way, note should be taken of a passage in Maimonides' letter concerning the opposition to his writings in the Baghdad Yeshiva. When religious figures reach positions of authority, he wrote, they often lose their fear of heaven. See David Z. Baneth, ed., Iggerot ha-Rambam, 2nd ed. (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1985), 63. 12. I quote from I. Twersky, who discusses this view but does not adopt it himself. See "The Mishneh Torah of Maimonides," Proceedings of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities 5 (1976): 265-96, reprinted in Twersky, Studies in Jewish Law and Philosophy (New York: Ktav, 1982): 76-107,268 (original) or 79 (reprint). 13. Maimonides' demand that Jews unquestioningly accept his ''thirteen principles of faith" on pain of exclusion from the Jewish people and the world to come is no refutation of this thesis. The</page><page sequence="18">90 Menachem Kellner "thirteen principles" had particular political/halakhic goals in mind, and, moreover, were addressed to those individuals, rabbis, and laity for whom the sort of intellectual independence Maimonides prized would be dangerous. See the discussion in my Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986), 34-49. 14. See Abraham J. Heschel, Maimonides (New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1982), 36, 75, and 83. 15. Maimonides' text reads: "Know that the things about which we shall speak in these chapters and in what will come in the commentary are not matters invented on my own nor explanations I have originated. Indeed, they are matters gathered from the Sages in the Midrash and the Talmud and other compositions of theirs, as well as from the discourse of both the ancient and modern philosophers, and from the compositions of many men. Hear the truth from whoever says it. Sometimes I have taken a complete passage from the text of a famous book. Now there is nothing wrong with that, for I do not attribute to myself what someone who preceded me has said. We hereby acknowledge this and shall not indicate that 'so and so said' and \so and so said,' since that would be useless prolixity. Moreover, identifying the name of such an individual might make the passage offensive to someone without experience and make him think it has an evil inner meaning of which he is not aware. Consequently, I saw fit to omit the author's name, since my goal is to be useful to the reader." I quote from the translation of R. L. Weiss and C. Butterworth in Ethical Writings of Maimonides (New York: Dover, 1983), 60. Note Maimonides' explicit reference here to readers who might reject a truth brought in the name of an author objectionable to them. 16. For an explicit and extreme expression of this notion, see the texts cited by Norman Lamm, Torah Umadda (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson, 1990), 52-53. 17. For other texts in which the same idea finds expression, see Guide III.8 (p. 267), where Maimonides states that the Sages, unlike Aristotle, erred in claiming that the movement of the spheres made sounds. He explains that there is nothing wrong with attributing error to the Sages in these matters: "[The Sages themselves! in these astronomical matters preferred the opinion of the sages of the nations of the world to their own. For they explicitly say, 'The Sages of the world have vanquished' [Pesahim 94bl. And this is correct. For everyone who argues in speculative matters does this according to the conclusions to which he was led by his speculation. Hence the conclusion whose demonstration is correct is believed." The truth is what counts, not the identity of the person who said it. We find a similar idea in the Mishneh Torah, "Laws of the Sanctification of the New Moon," XVII.24: "In that all these matters are established with clear proofs that are beyond reproach, such that one cannot possibly doubt them, we do not concern ourselves with their authors, whether they were composed by prophets or by gentile authors. For with respect to everything the reason of which has been discovered, and the truth of which has been made known through proofs that are beyond reproach, we rely upon he who said it." 18. For a contemporary statement to this effect, see the letter of Sheshet ben Isaac Benveniste of Saragossa to R. Meir ha-Levi Abulafia, published by Alexander Marx in 'Texts By and About Maimonides," Jewish Quarterly Review 25 (1934-35): 371-428, esp. 427. For more on Sheshet and his letter, see Septimus, Hispano-Jewish Culture in Transition, 46-48. On the democratizing effect of the Mishneh Torah, see I. Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980), 334-36, and Septimus, 40 and 73. See also Twersky's important comments in "The Mishneh Torah of Maimonides," 268-69 (original), 78-90 (reprint). 19. This passage appears in die introduction to the Mishneh Torah, just before the list of commandments. I quote (with emendations) from the translation of Moses Hyamson, Mishneh Torah: The Book of Knowledge by Maimonides (Jerusalem: Feldheim, 1974), 4b. 20. I defend this interpretation in Maimonides on Human Perfection, Brown Judaic Studies no. 202 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990), 13-39. See also Hannah Kasher, 'Talmud Torah as a Means of Apprehending God in Maimonides' Teachings" [in Hebrew!, Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 5 (1986): 71-81.</page><page sequence="19">Reading Rambam 91 21. Note should also be made of the fact that in "Laws of the Study of Torah," 1.7 and III. 10, Maimonides forbids scholars of Torah in the most uncompromising way from making their calling into a living. He flatly forbids Jews to charge a fee for teaching the Oral Torah, and further forbids them to live at the expense of others in order to study Torah. Maimonides was as good as his word; we have no record that he ever taught for a fee and he certainly supported himself. For a detailed discussion of Maimonides' attitude towards the subsidizing of rabbinic scholarship, see Bernard Septimus, " 'Kings, Angels, or Beggars': Tax Law and Spirituality in a Hispano-Jewish Responsum," in Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature 2, 15-18. 22. "Laws of Kings and their Wars," XII.2.1 cite the translation of A. M. Hershman, Book of Judges (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1949). 23. I say "seems to disparage" because, as I understand the parable, Maimonides was not comparing rabbis to scientists, to the disadvantage of the rabbis, but, rather, was comparing rabbis simpliciter to rabbis who had gone on to master the sciences. See my Maimonides on Human Perfection, 14-30. But even as I read it, and especially since very few rabbis actually fulfilled this ideal, the parable tums out to be an attack on the authority of rabbis as such. 24. For other medievals who read the text as did Shem Tov, see Maimonides on Human Perfection, 15-17. It should be noted that this attempt to cast doubt on the authenticity of offensive Maimonidean texts is not limited to the Middle Ages. R. Jacob ben Zvi Emden (1697-1776) entertained the possibility that the Guide of the Perplexed was not written by Maimonides, the author of the Mishneh Torah. See Jacob J. Schachter, "Rabbi Jacob Emden's Iggeret Purim," in Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature 2, 441-46. My thanks to Professor Sid Z. Leiman for this reference. 25. I quote from Maimonides' "Letter on Astrology," translated by Ralph Lerner, in Ralph Lemer and Muhsin Mahdi, eds.. Medieval Political Philosophy (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1972), 235. On this text see Jacob I. Dienstag, "Maimonides' Letter on Astrology to the Rabbis of Southern France" [in Hebrew), Kiryat Sefer 61 (1987): 147-58. 26. In this same letter Maimonides also argues against the notion of accepting as true things that are written in books, even ancient books, just because they are written there. 27. See also Yizhak (Isadore) Twersky, "Halakhah and Science: Perspectives on the Epistemology of Maimonides" [in Hebrew], Hebrew Law Annual 14-15 (1988-89): 121-51, esp. 124-25. Twersky's examples deal with Maimonides' discomfort with some contemporary rabbis, but they also support the thesis advanced here. I do not want to exhaust the reader by citing examples of this approach of Maimonides ad nauseum, and limit myself to just one more: the discussion of the nature of the aggadah near the beginning of Maimonides' introduction to Helek can be read as undermining the authority of Maimonides' rabbinic contemporaries, the overwhelming majority of whom, on Maimonides' own testimony there, understood aggadot literally, not allegorically. For an English translation of the text, see I. Twersky, ed., A Maimonides Reader (New York: Behrman House, 1972), 402-23. 28. I borrow this expression from W. Z. Harvey. See his interesting essay, 'The Return of Maimonideanism," Journal of Jewish Social Studies 42 (1980): 249-68. 29. On this matter see my Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish People. 30. This criticism was, in effect, made by Isaac Abravanel. Commenting on the words with which Maimonides opens the Mishneh Torah - "The foundation of all foundations and pillar of all the sciences is to know that there exists a First Existent" ("Laws of the Foundations of the Torah," 1.1) - Abravanel expostulates: "Of what concern is it of ours whether or not this foundation is the pillar of gentile sciences?" See Isaac Abravanel, Principles of Faith (Rosh Amanah), translated by M. M. Kellner (London: Associated University Presses, 1982), chap. 5, p. 76. 31. See Aviezer Ravitzky, "Mishnato shel R.

For more about this distinction between rabbis and intellectuals see my Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought, 66-69. 33. See Ravitzky's dissertation, 58-59. 34. On this, see the discussion in my "Gersonides' Commentary to Song of Songs: Why He Wrote It and To Whom It Was Addressed," in G. Dahan, ed., Gersonide en son temps (Louvain: Peeters, in press). 35. Compare Samuel ibn Tibbon's lament in his Commentary on Ecclesiastes that "many of our generation" reject Maimonides while only "one in a city, two in a family" properly appreciate the master. The text is cited by Ravitzky in "Samuel ibn Tibbon and the Esoteric Character of the Guide" 89. 36. A noted historian of medieval Jewry once told me that he could not care less "whether or not the active intellect had a tail." My point here is that such questions should be of interest to the social historian, not just to the historian of ideas. 37. The most important of Strauss's writings in this connection are "The Literary Character of the Guide of the Perplexed," in Essays on Maimonides, S. W. Baron, ed. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1941): 37-92 (reprinted in Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing [Glencoe, IL: Free Press, 1976]: 3-94); and "How to Begin to Study the Guide of the Perplexed," in Pines's translation of the Guide, xi-lvi. 38. To my mind, the best recent description and analysis of approaches to Maimonides may be found in Aviezer Ravitzky, "Sitrei Torato shel Moreh Nevukhim: Ha-Parshanut be-Dorotav u-ve-Doroteinu," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 5 (1986): 23-69. For further studies on this issue, see my Maimonides on Human Perfection, 68-69. 39. In Pines's translation, 111.54, p. 638. 40. Modern scholars who so interpret Maimonides include Isaac Husik, Alexander Altmann, Harry Zvi Blumberg, and David R. Blumenthal. In the Middle Ages this was the interpretation of Samuel ibn Tibbon and Shem Tov ibn Falaquera. For details, see Maimonides on Human Perfection, 67-68. 41. For details on all this, see Maimonides on Human Perfection, 7-11. 42. Writes Leaman: "Moses Maimonides falls squarely within the tradition of philosophy as it developed in the Islamic world during the period labelled medieval in the West" (p. 1 ). The book is wholly innocent of any references to Maimonides' Hebrew writings. 43. Berman's understanding of Maimonides is aptly summed up in the title of one his best-known essays, "Maimonides, the Disciple of Alfarabi," Israel Oriental Studies 4 (1974): 154-78. 44. This is roughly the view of Levinger, his book is a collection of previously published studies, from which much can be learned, but which add little to the question under discussion here. 45. Attention to al-Farabi as well as to Aristotle would have made the discussion even better. 46. The list of contemporary scholars whose work is ignored by Fox reads like a "Who's Who" of contemporary Maimonidean scholarship: Herbert A. Davidson, Jose Faur, Amos Funkenstein, Lenn Evan Goodman, David Hartman, Arthur Hyman, Alfred Ivry, Jacob Levinger, Avraham Nuriel, Aviezer Ravitzky, and Shalom Rosenberg. Scholars whose work is mentioned, but only in passing, include Lawrence Berman, Warren Zev Harvey, and Steven Schwarzschild. In effect, Fox has written a book on interpreting Maimonides that ignores most other interpreters of Maimonides. Fox also could have been more generous in acknowledging his intellectual debt to some of the researchers listed here. Given the quality and importance of the scholars whose work he did ignore, perhaps I should feel insulted that he did not overlook my work! It should be noted that Fox does not ignore all scholarship on Maimonides; but of the few scholars he does cite, many, if not most, lived between 50 and 90 years ago. This is as if, in writing a revisionist history of German Jewry, one made reference only to Graetz, F?rst, Geiger, and Jost 47. The articles are presented much as they originally appeared. 48. See the works of Klein-Braslavy cited by Fox on p. 257.</page><page sequence="21">Reading Rambam 93 49. One of my students once suggested that the perplexed individual for whom Maimonides wrote the Guide of the Perplexed was Maimonides himself. 50. Warren Zev Harvey presents a valuable neo-Straussian reading of 1.1 in "How to Begin to Study The Guide of the Perplexed, 1,1" [in Hebrew], Da1 at 21 (1988): 5-23, but it may have appeared too late for Fox to have been able to take it into account in his book. Lenn Evan Goodman's Rambam: Readings in the Philosophy of Moses Maimonides (New York: Viking, 1976) did not appear too late to be used. Fox laments the fact that no English commentary on the Guide has been written, but this is exactly what Goodman presents. Fox's discussion of ethics in Maimonides is an extended polemic against the interpretation of Maimonides presented by the late Steven Schwarzschild. There is nothing wrong with that; in fact, despite my close personal and philosophical ties to Schwarzschild, I rather think that with regard to many important details Fox is correct on the subject under dispute. But the uninformed reader of Fox's book (i.e., everyone in the world but a few score Maimonidean scholars) would have a hard time learning from Fox that his is not the only acceptable interpretation of Maimonides' views on ethics. 51. See pp. 122, 137, 141, 155, 172, 179, 190, 220, 317, and 334. 52. In this he elevates Schwarzschild, following Guttmann and ultimately Cohen, to the level of chief antagonist. He ignores the interpretations of Pines and Berman (political), and Twersky, Hartman, Rosenberg, and Kellner (halakhic). 53. See Cohen, "Charakteristik der Ethik Maimunis," in W.
