<plain_text><page sequence="1">Priesthood and Cult in Ancient Israel. Edited by GARY A. ANDERSON and SAUL M. OLYAN, Journal for the Study of the Old Testament Supplement Series, no. 125. Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1991. Pp. 217. $47.50. This volume consists of eight essays dealing with specific aspects of ancient Judean cultic practice and personnel. Four chapters deal with literary structure and content of particular legal texts contained in the Torah; the others deal with comparative religious approaches to bibli- cal texts and/or raise questions concerning pre- vious scholarship on aspects of "Israelite" cultic matters. Gary Anderson's contribution outlines the li- turgical use of praise made to God in the Judean temple. That sacrifice and prayer were integral to rituals throughout the ancient Near East is a given. The thesis presented here that Judeans used prayer as a substitute for sacrifice (or votive tablets) in a manner significantly different from the rest of the religious world of the time is not compelling. Hymns of praise are seen as declara- tions of the nearness of the speaker to God, rising upward into heaven by way of the temple (where heaven and earth meet), while lamentations are presented as bringing the speaker down to sheol (away from God and the temple). These observa- tions are neither new nor contested; against the statement on p. 32, however, it should be noted that caves were seen as entrances to the nether- world throughout the ancient world not because they could be used as tombs, but because, as everyone then knew, sheol/hades was downward, inside the earth. Baruch Schwartz provides a close literary reading of the laws concerned with the consump- tion of blood as they appear in Leviticus 17. The relation of these legal passages with similar bib- lical texts is considered in terms of dating, for- mulation, and social context. He makes a case for the use of the verb kpr to mean "ransom" in the idiom kpr Cl hnp&amp;, rather than "purge." The verses dealing with the prohibition of eating blood are seen to be a small chiastic formulation centering on the flat prohibition demanding the death penalty for such consumption. James VanderKam provides a reasoned re- sponse to the thesis of E M. Cross that the names of known High Priests of the Jerusalem Temple must be incomplete and that certain names had been lost due to haplography in copying lists of priests with the same name. The arguments for the duplication of priestly names in the Persian period are systematically con- fronted and dismissed. Finally, the author dem- onstrates that the spans of time which can be constructed for the offices of the known priests are not overly long to be believable. Susan Ackerman attempts to demonstrate that the background to the narrative of Jacob's dream at Bethel (Genesis 28) is a standard incubation ritual found throughout the ancient East Medi- terranean world. The article is an excellent source for incubation stories from Greek and Roman cultures; however, the attempt to combine the biblical passages of Isaac's blessing (as a ritual prelude) with Jacob's dream (as incubation) to create a "typical" ritual, which has somehow been divided into two separate tales, is totally unconvincing. Some thought as to the possibil- ity of deities instigating dreams in humans, unbidden by the mortals involved, needs to be consiered before assuming an incubation ritual constructed from two distinct and separated narratives. Saul Olyan's contribution deals with the ques- tion of oaths in Amos 8:14. The central argu- ment is the common suggestion that MT derek should be emended to dadeka. Olyan convinc- ingly dismisses the resulting "dad" as having</page><page sequence="2">140 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES VOL. 55 No. 2 been the name of a deity, as has been argued by G. W. Ahlstrim and others. Instead, the term is proposed to have meant "kinsman" and is con- vincingly shown to have been a standard Semitic divine epithet. Despite the author's presentation, the meaning of "dad" remains unclear. That it refers in this passage to Yahweh would be a rational conclusion if the author were more persuasive that the text needs emendation. Olyan reasonably argues that the word asimat should not be emended into a divine name. The author's reconstruction of the ritual sites of Dan and Beersheba as pilgrimage centers merely reflects biblical texts; it is agreed that we have cultic sites in both areas during the monarchy, but we cannot say from the archaeological data that they were pilgrimage centers. Olyan needs to address the question as to whether Jerusalem had ever been seen as a pilgrimage site for Is- raelites, or whether this was merely the wishful thinking of Judean authors since, as he correctly notes, Jeroboam was reconstructing a cult from older, indigenous religious traditions and not inventing new religious centers in Israel as Solo- mon in Jerusalem would have been seen as having done in the eyes of Israel. David Wright presents a speculative study on how the relation of various types of impurity may have been understood in priestly circles. The central thesis is that tolerated and prohib- ited impurities are related to larger notions of society. That there is almost no information in the biblical texts on which to develop this thesis is acknowledged. Therefore, the central argu- ments are taken from modern anthropological and sociological studies of ritual in other (and modern) cultures. The usual cautions required in making such arguments are duly noted in this presentation. Jacob Milgrom presents reasons why Lev. 11:24-40 should be seen as a late insertion into the impurity legislation dealing with meat con- sumption. As the verses in question concern themselves with touching unclean carcasses and the mode by which one may ritually cleanse one- self afterward, they are taken to be later than the food laws surrounding them. One needs to as- sume that the biblical legal scribes shared the same concerns for order and relationships of laws as the author professes, which is hard to es- tablish when the text, as it now appears, was de- vised by someone who obviously did not share such notions, but had some reason for the current formulation. The author concludes that the sec- tion is an H redaction of earlier P sources, and thus demonstrates the priority of P strata in the Torah over against H editorial activity. Israel Knol presents a response and elabora- tion to the work of A. Toeg on Num. 15:22-31. He argues that Num. 15 is not an exegesis of Lev. 4:14 but a completely revised legal text on the same topic. Knol sees a progression in the changes of sacrificial rules demonstrating a le- gal progression from popular cultic practices which understood an anthropomorphic deity to Priestly legislation which attempted to divorce cultic ritual from such anthropomorphism; this was to no avail as Holiness redactors purpose- fully reintroduced the popular traditions back into the ritual devised by the Priestly authors. The date of the passage is merely assumed to be that provided a century ago by Wellhausen and Kuenen, while the proposed "progression" seems arbitrary. LOWELL K.
