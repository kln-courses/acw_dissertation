<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Reader Replies DINING WITH ROBOTS Ellen Ullman tosses an encomium ("Evolu- tion, that good mother") to evolution into her familiar essay on cooking and artificial intelli- gence (Scholar, Autumn 2004) . Of course she doesn't literally mean that evolution is a "good mother." That would be anthropomorphism of the worst sort. It's simply a metaphor and one that fits comfortably into the conversational writing of a believer. But what's important is that such personifications are so abundantly encountered in the writings of evolutionists. Why? Can it be that converting evolution from an impersonal set of random meander- ings to a personal, caring agent bestows much greater credibility on the program? Evolution, we understand, teaches us to appreciate apples by killing all the individuals who preferred poi- son berries. However, it's not clear why this win- nowing would produce a humanity that likes apples, much less a humanity that appreciates them with such subtle connoisseurship. How many generations of natural selection would it take to produce humans who are attracted to complexities of taste? What purpose would such discernment serve in the contest for survival? By the tenets of evolution we would expect to find humans who recoil from poison berries but have no more discernment of good foods than horses or dogs. Learning "what's good for us and what's not" mandates no connoisseur- ship. In fact, it would appear to be far easier on our genetic transformation from ape-like an- cestors if we were less given to seeking out ex- otic flavors and unusual textures in our eating. In this sense, fine taste discernment appears to be counter-revolutionary: an invitation to trou- ble, a temptation to eat the Amanita phalloides that kills so thoroughly and with such agony. I'm afraid that the "good mother" evolution is not equipped to procure us the sensory re- finements of the gourmet. On the other hand, the good Father who created us appears not to have been bound by necessity, but was free to offer us many gifts beyond those necessary for bare survival. Evolution has no need of a desire for pleasure. Pure instinct can take care of its progress. Pleasure is a gift from God. Laszlo Bencze Brush Prairie, Washington</page></plain_text>
