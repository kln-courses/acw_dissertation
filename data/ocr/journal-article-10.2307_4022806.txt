What does it mean not simply to open it up to women's participation, broadening the range of faces in the class- room and pulpit, but to retell its stories, re- shape its core imagery and create new ritu- als that sanctify aspects of experience it had relegated to the margins or declared anathema? How, and by what right, do feminists take the power to challenge an- cient traditions at this level, traditions that claim not only the authority of age but also of divine sanction? These questions occupy feminists in all the major world religions; these three very different books take on the project of trans- forming religion in relation to Judaism. Sharing a trenchant critique of the patriar- chal character of central Jewish texts and symbols, their authors nonetheless insist that Judaism is a pluralistic and continu- ally evolving tradition, and that at least some of its branches can become genu- inely inclusive of women. Rachel Adler's Engendering Judaism is the richest of these three volumes theoreti- cally. The first full-length Jewish feminist theology since my own book, Standing Again at Sinai, was published in 1990, it both builds on and departs from earlier feminist work, creating a theology and eth- ics that are dazzling in their inventiveness and analytic power. Arguing I believe rightly-that the traditional categories of Jewish theology God, Torah and Is- rael-cannot fully accommodate feminist insights and questions, Adler slyly sug- gests that the multidisciplinary "shit method" would permit feminists to engage with tradition without locking us into modes of thinking that subvert the direc- tions we want to take. The name of her method is a bilingual pun the Yiddish word for "throw" and the Anglo-Saxon term for excrement. Eastem European grandmothers joked that they cooked by the "shit method": "you throw [shit] in a little flour, you throw [shit] in a little sugar." Actually a carefully crafted heuristic, Adler says, that allowed women to cook "in environments where resources were scarce and undependable," the method is an excellent metaphor for the Jewish femi- nist task of having to fashion a new Juda- ism out of the often indigestible ingredi- ents offered by the tradition. It enables feminists to draw freely on elements of tra- dition, yet combine them with insights and criticisms derived from feminist theory. Adler makes excellent use of this method, gathering a wide range of theo- retical resources and applying them to a variety of feminist theological issues: the challenge of reclaiming texts that erase and diminish women, the problems in- volved in creating inclusive communal prayer, the need for a new ethics of sexual- ity. But the centerpiece and greatest contri- bution of Engendering Judaism lies in its rethinking of halakhah (Jewish law), a topic that plays a complex role in the Jew- ish feminist agenda. On the one hand, the problem of ha- lakhah has been with Jewish feminism from its very beginnings. Law is a uniquely central category of Jewish relig- ious life, and the legal exclusion of women from traditional communal prayer and the legal subordination of women in marriage and divorce were major topics in early Jewish feminist writing. On the other hand, because attitudes towards halakhah are closely intertwined with Jewish de- nominationalism, non-Orthodox Jews, myself included, have tended to move quickly past halakhic concerns to other di- mensions of women's exclusion from Jew- ish texts and ritual. Legal questions then become the domain of Orthodox feminists, who are struggling for change within the halakhic system, but who have no interest in transforming it. Adler is a non-Orthodox Jew who deci- sively rejects the notion that the definition and practice of halakhah belong to Ortho- doxy. Halakhah, she argues, is necessarily of concern to all Jews, because it "trans- lates the stories and values of Judaism into ongoing action." It is "a way for communi- ties of Jews to generate and embody their Jewish moral visions." Drawing on legal theorist Robert Cover's image of law as a bridge, Adler depicts halakhah as a ten- sion system strung between our present world of often rigid and impoverished le- gal norms and "the richer and more vital worlds that could be." 'Ultimately," she says, "law is maintained or remade, not by orthodoxies or visions but by commit- ments of communities either to obey the law as it stands or to resist and reject it in order to live out some altemative legal vi- sion." The theory Adler presents is itself of major importance, constituting the first feminist framework for re-visioning ha- lakhah. But in line with her insistence that praxis is central to Judaism and that "a the- ology requires a method that can connect what we believe with what we do," she embodies her theory in an exciting con- crete proposal. The last chapter of Engen- dering Judaism offers both an extended ar- gument for thoroughly reconceptualizing the Jewish wedding ceremony, and a new b 'rit ahuvim, or lovers' covenant, rooted in partnership law rather than the law of ac- quisition that currently governs Jewish marriage. Adler develops the theoretical rationale and legal basis for the b'rit ahu- vim, and she offers specific suggestions for implementing the ceremony, such as placing rings together in a bag, an an- cient legal gesture for entering into a partnership. The chapter draws together the various strands in Adler's "shit method" and the earlier sometimes loosely related themes of the book. The result is a rich brew that many pro- gressive Jews will find nourishing and usable, and many non-Jewish feminists will find an important model of the com- bination of theory and practice. T nHE INSISTENCE ON PRAXIS that charac- terizes Adler's work is equally cen- tral to Marcia Falk's Book of Bless- ings but with a different emphasis. Adler is a theoretician interested in embodying her theory; Falk is a poet and liturgist whose extensive notes and commentary describe the commitments and theory that undergird the new prayers that make up this book. Like Adler (and Alpert), Falk is a non-Orthodox Jew who finds that the fragmentation of contemporary American Judaism offers a space within which to imagine a feminist Judaism. In love with the Hebrew language, yet deeply critical of the sexism, anthropocentrism and rigidity of the traditional liturgy, she manages to create extraordinarily beautiful pray- ers-in Hebrew and English-that are both radically new and deeply resonant with Jewish tradition. For many readers, The Book of Bless- ings will not immediately announce itself as feminist liturgy, for it lacks the feature most characteristic of that genre. Most Jewish (and Christian) feminist prayer uses female God language-invoking the Shekhinah (the feminine image of God in the Jewish mystical tradition), creating new female names for divinity, or rewrit- ing traditional blessings in grammatically feminine language. For at least some some feminists, feminist liturgy is defined by use of such language. But Falk uses no fe- male images and little feminine grammar. Instead, she evokes the sacred as totally immanent in creation, offering an alterna- tive to the whole notion of God as male or female person. In effecting a radical trans- formation of divinity, she embodies in wonderful poetry many of the central claims and insights of 25 years of feminist theology. An emphasis on immanence as opposed to transcendence has been one of the most salient characteristics of feminist reflec- tion on God. The God known in and through the world, a God who is empow- erer rather than power over, has been in- voked repeatedly in feminist theological writing. And yet, to the extent that feminist liturgy has simply inserted female names and pronouns into standard prayers, it has offered up a slightly softened version of the traditional God rather than realize a new understanding of the sacred. The Book of Blessings is more successful in captur- ing feminist discussion and principles li- turgically, by summoning the divine as "the dynamic, alive, and unifying whole- ness within creation." This insistence on immanence is closely related to other central themes in feminist theology and theory: an apprecia- tion of embodiment, the dismantling of hi- erarchies and the search for a new lan- guage of difference. In seeking the divine both "nowhere in particular" and yet eve- rywhere, in every moment and detail of everyday experience, Falk refuses the hier- archy of soul and body that historically has been intertwined with the hierarchy of male and female. "Washing the hands," she writes, "we call to mind the holiness of body." We can find divinity wherever our "hearts and minds, our blood and souls are stirred." But Falk never confuses the rejec- tion of hierarchical dualisms with the abo- lition of distinction. "The recognition of difference is part of the very appreciation of life," she argues. Her final blessing for havdalah (the ceremony that ends the Sab- bath, separating it from the week) can be taken as a quintessential feminist state- STAT UN ERST FNEWTR VICE PRESIDENT for ACADEMIC AFFAIRS The State University of New York at New Paltz invites applications and nominations for the position of Vice President for Academic Affairs.

The many feminist themes in Falk's work come together in her daring reformu- lation of the Sh'ma, the central and most famous prayer in the Jewish liturgy. In her hands, "Hear, 0 Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One" becomes "Hear, 0 Is- rael-/The divine abounds everywhere/ and dwells in everything;/ the many are One." This passage is not simply extraor- dinary liturgy; it also represents a thorough reconceptualization of monotheism. Rather than the elevation of a single male image as the image of God, monotheism becomes "the honoring of diversity within the unity of creation." Whether Falk's theology of immanence is spiritually satisfying and authentically Jewish has been a subject of debate since her first blessings appeared in print some years ago. Rachel Adler, for example, is appreciative of Falk's liturgical creativity, but also critical of what she calls her "uni- tive spirituality," charging her with "em- brac[ing] the deadly experience of fusion." While 1 share Adler's unwillingness to sur- render all anthropomorphic images of God-if God can be found in the apple and the stone, why not in the attributes of per- sonhood?-I think she seriously misreads Falk, who continually balances the experi- ence of unity with the appreciation of indi- viduality and diversity. The fact that Falk's liturgy generates heated theological discussion, however, indicates the importance and usefulness of this book to a wide audience. Readers should not assume that because The Book of Blessings is a Jewish prayerbook it is only that, or addressed only to Jews. It has much to offer to anyone interested in the transformation of images and conceptions of the sacred-and that includes atheists! EBECCA ALPERT'S Like Bread on the j Seder Plate lacks the brilliance of .L\~Engendering Judaism and The Book of Blessings, but it makes a solid contribution to both Jewish feminism and lesbian and gay studies, breaking new ground in its focus on transforming Jew- ish religious life from a lesbian perspec- tive. Much of the early literature on Jew- ish lesbians centered on issues of identity and anti-Semitism rather than on relig- ious change, and few books on the femi- nist transformation of Judaism-includ- ing my own and the two others reviewed here have paid much attention to spe- cifically lesbian concerns. Alpert ad- dresses the serious lacunae in Jewish feminist theory by adapting many of the insights of feminist theology to a lesbian transformational perspective. Writing in a straightforward, invit- ing-sometimes pastoral-voice that reaches out to a large audience, Alpert de- fines lesbianism in a multi-faceted way that allows her to examine shifting under- standings of lesbianism in Jewish tradi- tion. Lesbianism, she argues, is generally identified with three elements: "same-sex sexual desire and attraction; woman- identified romantic friendship and femi- nism; and gender nonconformity." The complex interaction of these elements ex- plains the stigmatization and invisibility of Jewish lesbians, at the same time that it provides the grounds for establishing a re- ligious Jewish lesbian identity. Alpert is interested in both the critical and construc- tive potential of this definition. She ex- plores the sexism and heterosexism of tra- ditional Jewish sources, but also considers fiction and psychological and historical texts that "the real lives and literary repre- sentations of Jewish lesbians...," maki.ng it possible to imagine a Judaism reshaped from a lesbian perspective. The two chapters of Like Bread on the Seder Plate in which Alpert discusses a se- lection of modern and contemporary sources are among the most interesting in the book. She uses the categories of sexu- ality and gender nonconformity to revisit the lesbian elements in the work of some prominent Jewish writers, and discuss the lives of a number of Jewish lesbians whose histories or identities have been lost or ob- scured. She argues, for example, that Isaac Bashevis Singer used his fictional charac- ter Yentl to explore the issues of sexuality and gender boundaries in Judaism, in full knowledge of the work of the early sexolo- gists. Barbra Streisand's movie depiction of Yentl as a woman who dressed like a man simply in order to be able to study To- rah flattened Singer's portrait of Yentl as a woman with a double identity. Alpert finds a historical example of gender nonconformity in the remarkable story of Charlotte Wolff, a Jewish physi- cian who lived as a lesbian in Weimar Ger- many and later became part of the gay rights movements in Britain. Publishing her first book on lesbians, Love Between Women, in 1971 at the age of 74, Wolff spent her last fifteen years exploring the relationship between her German Jewish and lesbian identities, insisting on the analogies between anti-Semitism and ho- mophobia. Like Adler and Falk, Alpert is centrally concemed with the transformation of Jew- ish self-understandings and practices. Her presentation of literary and historical sources is meant to challenge and open up the Jewish textual tradition, creating a Jewish lesbian corpus that will become part of the history through which Jews de- fine themselves. This new corpus can then support and help interpret the active pres- ence of lesbians in the Jewish community, which demands a reconstruction of ritual as well as history. The central chapters of Like Bread on the Seder Plate are filled with suggestions for ways Jewish lesbians can rework traditional ceremonies and holiday observances and create rituals of our own. Alpert addresses the invisibility of les- bian partners as moumers in Jewish rituals around death and touches on the holidays as focal points for tensions between lesbi- ans and families of origin. She also offers a variety of rituals for coming out, both as a major rite of passage and as a gradual and ongoing process. Coming out can be cele- brated as an important life-cycle event on the analogy of the bat mnitzvah (girl's com- ing of age). But since lesbians are continu- ally confronted with new occasions for re- vealing our identities, it is also appropriate to say a blessing each time the process is furthered. "'Let us bless the source of life," she suggests, using one of Falk's blessing formulas, "for giving me the courage to come out." It is perhaps not surprising that these books share an emphasis on praxis, for the insistence that the sacred must be made manifest in the ordinary details of experi- ence is one of the powerful teachings of Ju- daism that keeps Jewish feminists in con- versation with a patriarchal tradition. Af- firming the connection between belief and action is part of what marks Adler, Falk and Alpert's work as Jewish, at the same time that the content they give to belief and practice is often startlingly new. If Adler sees law as a bridge from the Judaism that is to the one that could be, then she, Falk and Alpert are all builders of this bridge, writing out of and for new communities of feminist/lesbian Jews toward a new Jewish future. .0 2 The Women's Review of Books / Vol. XV, No.4 / January 1998</page></plain_text>
