<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AUTHOR OF DE DEA SYRIA AND HIS CULTURAL HERITAGE1 LUCINDA DIRVEN Summary The present contribution deals with the identity of the author of De Dea Syria, a second century work that claims to provide an accurate description of the religion in the Syrian city Hierapolis. Despite this assertion the information of DS has often been discredited. This is due to its presumed author, Lucian of Samosata. Since Lucian is known for his sceptical attitude towards religion, it is often concluded that the DS intents to ridicule the cult of Hierapolis. This assertion diminishes the reliability of the DS, since it implies that it contains fanciful and exaggerated information. It will be argued that the content of the DS provides no firm proof for Lucian's authorship. If the work was written by Lucian, he wrote in a style normally foreign to him. Apart from the wish to attribute this work to Lucian, there are no grounds to interpret the DS in the light of his oeuvre. Instead of starting from a preconceived idea about the author, this article aims to establish his identity by means of the contents of the work itself. Starting point is the allegation of the author that he is a Syrian who personally visited Hierapolis. The information provided by the DS on the Hierapolitan cult tallies with contemporary archaeological material and literary sources. It can therefore be concluded that the account is indeed based upon a personal visit. The author's self-identification as a Syrian is confirmed by the contents and the objective of the DS. On the basis of the contents of the DS its author is best described as a Hellenized Syrian who aimed to assimilate the Hierapolitan cult with Greek culture, while retaining its unique characteristics. As such his account intends to propagate the cult of the Syrian goddess in the Hellenistic world, in all probability especially in Hellenistic Syria. One of the very rare accounts of Syrian religion in the Roman Period is IIEPI THE EYPIHE ?EOY, better known under its Latin title De Dea Syria (henceforth abbreviated as DS).2 Potentially the DS is of great value for reconstructing pagan religion in late antique Syria, for it provides a detailed description of a Syrian cult in the Roman period in a way that is unparalleled in other literary sources @ Koninklijke Brill, Leiden (1997) NUMEN, Vol. 44</page><page sequence="2">154 Lucinda Dirven of the time.3 Furthermore, it may be the only extant account of Syrian paganism that has no complex history of transmission.4 For all these advantages, however, many scholars have been reluc- tant to use DS as a source on Syrian religion in the Roman Period on account of its presumed author, viz. Lucian of Samosata. Since Lucian is known as a satirist, it has often been assumed that DS is not a serious account of religious practice in Hierapolis and one or two other Syrian cities, but a parody in disguise. As a result, its information has been regarded as suspect. The present contribution seeks to demonstrate that the value of DS as a religio-historical document has been erroneously underrated. It will be argued in the following pages that there are no solid grounds for the attribution of DS to Lucian of Samosata; like Lucian, its author was a Hellenized Syrian, but unlike Lucian, he was very serious about the religious phenomena he describes. It is theoretically possible that this sincere man was Lucian of Samosata under a temporary spell of devotion, writing a work in manner normally foreign to him. Such speculations would be of limited interest: what matters is that the author of DS should be acknowledged as a man who is serious about religion, having the earnest desire to provide a reliable and favourable account of the cult of the Syrian goddess in Hierapolis. Lucian of Samosata and the Interpretation of De Dea Syria Together with 81 other works, DS is currently attributed to the second-century rhetorician and satirist Lucian of Samosata.5 The ma- nuscript tradition is unanimous in ascribing the work to Lucian and for many centuries his authorship remained unchallenged.6 However, the nineteenth century witnessed a number of attacks on the work's authenticity, so that by 1850 the Lucianic authorship was no longer undisputed.7 Lucian's defence was taken with vigour by Jacob Burck- hardt. His arguments persuaded Theodore Nildeke and Franz Cu- mont, both prominent scholars on late antique Syria.8 The major- ity of Lucianic scholars of the present century have followed their authoritative voices. Recently Robert A. Oden Jr. re-evaluated the</page><page sequence="3">The Author of De Dea Syria 155 authorship debate, and his influential study decided the question in favour of Lucian.9 Resisting the pressure of the majority opinion, a minority of schol- ars has nevertheless continued to doubt Lucian's authorship.10 Unfor- tunately, however, they have failed to give an outline of the cultural identity and intentions of its real author." They stress the reliability of DS and claim that the quest for its authorship is of no importance to the archaeologist or historian. The latter point is difficult to main- tain, however. If DS was written by Lucian, we have every reason to distrust its information. The usefulness of DS as a religio-historical document hinges largely on the question of its authorship. Although the individual identity of the author may be of little importance, his cultural identity is a serious matter. This cultural identity must be established, not on preconceived ideas about the presumed author, but on the contents of DS itself. What clues does DS provide to the identity of its author? It must be admitted that the few autobiographical data provided by the author of DS are in keeping with what is known about the life of Lucian of Samosata (ca. 120-180 AD).12 The author of DS claims to be a Syrian by birth and declares that he has visited Hiera- polis in his youth.13 Lucian was from Samosata, the capital of the Syrian province of Commagene.14 Since Samosata is situated about 150 kilometres north of Hierapolis, Lucian may well have visited the 'Holy City' in his youth. The author of DS was well informed about the various Hierapolitan religious traditions and was probably able to communicate with the inhabitants in their native language. Lucian may have had the same ability, for he informs us that "in his youth he still spoke a barbarian language and wore a jacket (kandys) in the Assyrian style".'5 DS is written in Greek and its author must have enjoyed a classical education. Lucian left his native city to pursue a career as a Greek rethorician in the cultural centres of the Roman world. Both Lucian and the author of DS are best defined as Hellenized Syrians. Yet if the details of Lucian's personal life make him a likely can- didate as the writer of DS, the style of the book is wholly uncharac-</page><page sequence="4">156 Lucinda Dirven teristic of Lucian's writings as we know them. The appreciation of religious matters in the DS stands in marked contrast to the sceptical attitude towards religion in Lucian's other work.16 Satire on religion abounds in Lucian's genuine writings, but many of the items normally ridiculed pass without satirical comment in DS. A few examples may be given in illustration. Whereas non-Greek gods are the object of scorn and mockery in Lucian's Assembly of Gods, the non-Greek cult at Hierapolis is described with respect if not admiration. Whereas Lu- cian considers Egypt to be a land of magic and dubious miracles, the author of DS admires Egyptian religion for its antiquity.17 The all too human behaviour of allegedly supra-natural gods is a favourite topic in Lucian's writings; to the author of DS, however, Hera's love for the mortal Kombabos is quite natural.'8 Lucian ridicules the punish- ment of men by the gods, whereas tales of divine anger are a fact of everyday life for the author of DS.19 The idea that gods dwell in a particular place, whether this be heaven, a temple, or an im- age, is frequently ridiculed in Lucian's writings; the author of DS, on the other hand, deduces the presence of the gods from their ex- traordinary cult images; he extols the sanctity of these statues and the temple in which they are housed.20 Lucian particularly dislikes oracles and magic, which he ascribes to human weakness.21 His con- tempt for oracles comes to the fore most clearly in the well-known satire Alexander the False Prophet, but is present in his other writings as well. Compared to Lucian's habitual criticism, the neutral account of Apollo's wondrous oracle in Hierapolis would be a conspicuous exception.22 Defenders of Lucian's authorship have advanced divergent expla- nations in order to fit the uncritical DS into Lucian's satirical oeuvre. Some have looked for a psychological explanation, ascribing the lack of satire in DS to either the youth or the old age of its author; chau- vinism may have rendered him uncritical towards popular religion in his native country.23 However, the majority of scholars refuse to acknowledge the serious nature of DS; they try to put DS on a par with Lucian's writings by emphasizing its humour. Yet the definition of this supposed humour is problematic. Most commentators have</page><page sequence="5">The Author of De Dea Syria 157 followed Burckhardt in labelling the work ironic.24 By doing exactly the opposite of what he normally does, that is, by apparently aban- doning his usual sceptical attitude towards religion, Lucian would have wished to heap ridicule upon the Hierapolitan cult. This effect would have been enhanced by his writing in the Ionic dialect, which must be seen as a subtle parody of the Ionic revival in his time and of the naive and credulous Herodotus.25 Thematic parallels between Lucian's writings and Herodotus' Histories are cited in order to sub- stantiate this hypothesis.26 Some scholars add examples of transparent jokes and puns to prove the presence of an otherwise inconspicuous humour.27 These arguments in favour of Lucian's authorship are by no means decisive. Though the use of the Ionic dialect might theoretically be a parody on its revival in the second century, it is more natural to take DS as an instance of this revival. Nothing proves that the imita- tion of Herodotus' style is intended as parody. On the contrary, like Arrian's Indika, DS can also be read as a homage to one of the first Greek ethnographers.28 The similarities with Herodotus seem inten- tional, since DS also resembles the Histories with regard to themes and subject matter. In this respect DS compares with the roughly contemporary Description of Greece by Pausanias. The resemblance of Pausanias' work to the Histories is usually explained as the result of its being a guide book with historical, religious, and mythological digressions; the similarity with the Histories is due to genre, not to direct borrowing.29 One fails to see why a similar line of reasoning is not followed with regard to DS. Pausanias is as interested in various religious traditions as the author of DS, and neither his work nor DS need be seen as a parody on the 'credulous' Herodotus. Nor are their accounts superstitious or ironic.30 The similarities between DS and the Description of Greece are indeed such that the author of DS must be supposed to have been as serious in his account as Pausanias was in his. The alleged intents of parody call for another comment. Helm rightly remarks that the parodist has a duty to see to it that his audi- ence can recognize his irony.31 The preface to the work is the most</page><page sequence="6">158 Lucinda Dirven obvious place to make such a statement. For example, Lucian points out the irony of the True Histories in the foreword to this work. In the preface to DS, however, the author takes the trouble to convince his reader of the trustworthiness of his account.32 Thus the only possible way to maintain the Lucianic authorship is to assume that Lucian presented DS before an audience familiar with his other work, and capable of appreciating a very subtle form of irony.33 If the irony re- sides in the intended contrast between a seemingly serious account of religious matters and the overtly disparaging account of human fol- lies in religious matters, everything in DS can be qualified as irony.34 The argument suffers from a vicious circularity: Lucian is a satirist on religion; DS was written by Lucian; DS is serious on religion; DS must be intended as a parody; the irony of DS proves that Lucian was its author. The presence of humour in DS must be proven on the basis of indubitable cases. Yet the instances of overt humour are strongly dis- puted among the commentators of DS. Since one's sense of humour is determined largely by cultural and social factors, this difference in opinion is not solved easily.35 Even if the presence of instances of wit and humour should be granted, this would not prove that the work as a whole must be read as a satire.36 It was not uncommon for authors to incorporate a few jokes into a serious work. Humour is a social and cultural phenomenon and this makes it difficult to decide whether DS was funny to the ancient reader or not. The satire of oriental cults was a favourite topic with Greek and Roman authors, and to their audience much of the Hierapolitan cult as described in DS may have seemed ludicrous and barbaric.37 Yet it can only be maintained that DS was a parody on an oriental cult if it is assumed that Lucian was its author; the alleged humour does not prove the assumption about the authorship. It will be clear by now to what extent the question of the authorship of DS influences its appreciation as a source on Syrian religion in the Roman Period. The arguments adduced to prove Lucian's authorship detract from the historical value of DS. The presumed satirical char- acter of the work diminishes the reliability of its information, since</page><page sequence="7">The Author of De Dea Syria 159 it implies that the work contains fanciful and exaggerated accounts.38 By ascribing DS to Lucian, the book is turned into a superficial and unreliable account by an outsider. Visiting the city as a tourist with a bias against religion, the author would have missed important as- pects of the Hierapolitan cult while misinterpreting others.39 It must be concluded that the value of DS, in spite of its being the most com- prehensive source on pagan religion in Syria in the Roman Period, is seriously jeopardized by its attribution to Lucian. Since the author- ship of Lucian of Samosata is dubious, it is of interest to determine the cultural identity of the author on the basis of the content of DS. The Reliability of De Dea Syria The author of DS claims that his accounts and descriptions are based upon information he obtained himself while visiting the 'Holy City'. This assertion can be substantiated by a wide variety of con- temporary literary sources and archaeological remains, originating from Hierapolis, from other places in Syria and Mesopotamia, and from the Greek and Roman world.40 In order to verify the information provided by DS, it must be taken into account that these secondary sources are not equally accurate and valuable.41 Starting from the author's assertion that he writes about Hierapolis, evidence from the 'Holy City' itself is the crown witness. Next, the anecdotes on Hier- apolis as related by contemporary Syrian, Roman, and Greek authors must be discussed. Information on the cult of Atargatis and Hadad from Syria and Mesopotamia will be used to substantiate the author's claim that Hierapolis was a centre of pilgrimage for Syria and the surrounding countries.42 The cult of Atargatis in the rest of the Greek and Roman world is of no direct importance for our purpose.43 Like most cults detached from their native country, the cult of the Syrian goddess changed under the influence of its new surroundings. It is often difficult to distinguish the old from the new, and the material is therefore best left aside.44 Material for comparison from Hierapolis consists mainly of ar- chaeological remains. In the modern city of Membij, very little is</page><page sequence="8">160 Lucinda Dirven left of the ancient sanctuary of the Syrian goddess.45 Unfortunately the area was never systematically excavated. However, archaeolo- gists who have visited the city at the beginning of this century, have remarked on the similarity between the sacred area as described in DS and the traces still visible in their time.46 Apart from these ac- counts, several chance-finds from Hierapolis confirm the observations of the author of DS. Local coinage, known from two periods, is most instructive. The first group dates from the period between about 332- 312 BC, when the reigning priests of Hierapolis were responsible for the minting of silver coins with Aramaic legends.47 The second group covers the period between Trajan and Philippus Arabus, when the local mint produced imperial coins.48 According to DS, the clergy in Hierapolis consisted of a group of over three hundred priests under the supervision of an annu- ally elected high-priest. Only the high-priest wore purple and was crowned with a golden tiara. The regular priesthood wore white robes and white pointed caps (piloi).49 Reliefs from Hierapolis that depict the high-priest confirm the account in DS.50 A representa- tion of a priest on a Hierapolitan coin from the fourth century BC fits the author's description of the common Hierapolitan priest.51 DS makes abundantly clear that by the second century AD, the Syrian goddess had far surpassed her male companion in importance. The goddess' predominance is confirmed by the prevalence of her image on the city's coinage.52 The iconography of the Hierapolitan gods as described in DS finds an exact parallel on Hierapolitan imperial coinage. A famous coin of Alexander Severus portrays the scene of the inner chamber precisely as described in DS, i.e., Hera and Zeus enthroned on lions and bulls, sitting on both sides of the semeion.53 The author of DS calls the Hierapolitan couple by the Greek names of Zeus and Hera. However, he does not fail to mention that the in- habitants of the city call Zeus by another name.54 The same holds true for the other Hierapolitan gods. The Hellenistic coins with Ara- maic inscriptions allow us to establish some of the local names. The image of Zeus is accompanied by the legend hdd, "Hadad", or hdrn, which is either a mistake for hdd, or a Hadad epithet meaning "the</page><page sequence="9">The Author of De Dea Syria 161 splendid one".55 The name of the goddess occurs as 'th, "tr'th and tr'th, rendered in Greek as Atargatis or Derceto.56 According to the author, Hierapolis was not the original name of the city.57 Two Hi- erapolitan coins from the Hellenistic period bear the legend mnbg "Manbug". Manbug is certainly derived from the Semitic root nb', meaning "to bring forth", "to come out", from which are derived "source" and "spring".58 Thus the native name of the city confirms the DS account of the prominent position of the chasm or sacred source in Hierapolis.59 The important role of the source in the Hierapolitan cult is re- flected in Jacob of Serug's (451-521 AD) Homily on the Fall of the Idols.60 Not surprisingly, Jacob of Serug and other Syriac writers call the city and its gods by their local names. However, most of them only briefly mention Mabbug with regard to other cult centres of Atargatis.61 More elaborate is the information on Hierapolis in the Syriac Apology of Pseudo-Melito, written at the beginning of the third century, perhaps at Hierapolis itself.62 The Apology contains a long euhemeristic section on the pagan cult of Hierapolis, which undoubt- edly is a translation from a Greek original: "The Syrians worship 'Aty from Hadib, who sent the daughter of BLT a physician; and she cured Simi, the daughter of Hadad, king of Syria." The Apology then relates a long story of two magicians, Nebo and Hadaran, who practised their art near a well at Mabbug in which an unclean demon resided.63 In order to slay the demon, both magicians commanded Simi, the daughter of Hadad, to bring water from the sea and pour it into the well. Due to the euhemeristic point of view, the information provided by pseudo-Melito is hard to interpret. However, the data are in ac- cordance with those found in DS and the sources of Hierapolis.64 Thus the name 'Aty is the Syrian transcription of the original Ara- maic name of the Syrian goddess as attested on Hierapolitan coins.65 Likewise, Hadaran, the name of one of the magicians, appears as an epithet of Hadad on Hierapolitan coins from the fourth century BC.66 Pseudo-Melito uses the local name Nebo instead of Apollo. Similar in this respect to DS, the Apology mentions the magic qualities of</page><page sequence="10">162 Lucinda Dirven Nebo-Apollo and his relation to the spring in Hierapolis.67 In a char- acteristically euhemeristic way the semeion is personified as Simi, the daughter of Hadad. In spite of this personification, the role of Simi is very similar to that played by the semeion in the water rite as described in DS.68 Like their Syrian colleagues, some Greek and Latin authors are familiar with the local name of the city and its divinities.69 Pliny, for example, writing in the first century AD, states that "(the inhabitants of) Bambyce, a city also called Hierapolis, but called Mabog by the Syrians, worship the prodigious Atargatis, who is called Derceto by the Greeks."70 The latter designation of the Syrian goddess fits the account given by DS.71 Derceto is by no means the only name with which the Greek and Latin authors identify the Syrian goddess. According to Plutarch and others, she was also called Aphrodite or Hera.72 Of special interest is Plutarch's characterization of the Syrian Goddess as a goddess of fertility on account of her intimate relation with water. The account in DS of fish adorned with gold which come when summoned, finds a parallel description in Pliny's Natural History and Aelian's On the Nature of Animals.73 The bearded, seated figure, in the pronaos of the temple in Hierapolis is described similarly in DS and in Macrobius' Saturnalia. Both authors state that the city's inhabitants call this deity Apollo.74 Likewise, Macrobius' description of the statues of Atargatis and Hadad tallies with their representation in DS.75 DS emphasizes the immense wealth of the sanctuary in Hierapolis, a claim confirmed by Plutarch, who relates that it took the Roman general Crassus many days to list the treasuries of the goddess.76 The author of DS underlines that Atargatis' sanctuary at Hierapolis was a place of pilgrimage for people from Syria and the surrounding countries.77 Syrian literary sources as well as archaeological remains confirm that Atargatis' cult in Syria and Mesopotamia was influenced by her great cult centre in Hierapolis.78 Jacob of Serug notes the intimate relation between the cult of Atargatis in Harran and that in Hierapolis.79 The Syriac Doctrina Addai explicitly connects the worship of Atargatis at Edessa to that at Hierapolis.8so The practice</page><page sequence="11">The Author of De Dea Syria 163 of self-emasculation, given much prominence in DS, was apparently also prevailing at Edessa, for according to the Syriac Book of the Laws of Countries King Abgar felt obliged to proscribe the custom.8' The influence of the Hierapolitan cult is also apparent from the archaeological remains from Syria and Mesopotamia. The phalloi that stood in front of the Hierapolitan sanctuary also formed part of Atargatis' temple at Dura Europos.82 In almost every sanctuary ded- icated to her-at Hierapolis, Edessa, Ascalon, and elsewhere, Atar- gatis possessed a pond with sacred fish.83 Atargatis' connection with fish is also reflected in her regional iconography.84 Under the in- fluence of the cult of Atargatis at Hierapolis, various local Syrian goddesses and the Arabic goddess Allat took on traits of Atargatis in their iconography.85 Likewise the iconography of the official cult stat- ues as described in DS spread through Syria and Mesopotamia. For example, on a third-century relief found at Dura Europos, the divine couple and the semeion are depicted in accordance with the account in DS. The similarity is so striking that the relief was probably styled after the cult statues of the Hierapolitan gods.86 On the basis of this evidence it must be concluded that a great deal of the information provided by DS on Hierapolitan religion is accurate. We may therefore presume that those elements for which there is no external confirmation are essentially trustworthy as well. This makes DS a unique source for reconstructing the religion of second-century Hierapolis. The fact of its reliability also throws an interesting light on the unknown author of the book. It is to this question that we shall turn in the following section. The Syrian Heritage of the Author The verifiable reliability of the information of the cult of the Syrian goddess in Hierapolis is best explained by the assumption that the author of DS did in fact visit the 'Holy City', just as he maintains. What was his country of origin? The author himself claims to be a Syrian (yp6pc M%' AcIr6pto 6\V).87 This characterization is in itself not particularly revealing, since by the second century AD Syria knew</page><page sequence="12">164 Lucinda Dirven various cultural milieus, ranging from highly local and traditional to thoroughly Greek and Hellenized. As a Syrian, the author of DS belonged to one of these cultural milieus and the cultural paradigms of his milieu will have determined his perception of Hierapolitan religion. In all probability this is reflected in DS. Thus in order to verify the author's origin, DS should be examined for clues to his cultural milieu. Many commentators have stressed the Hellenistic characteristics of DS.88 Most obvious, of course, is the fact that the account is written in Greek. The use of the Ionic dialect, in imitation of the vener- able Herodotus, underscores the work's Hellenistic character. The description of the Phoenician sanctuaries, discussed by way of intro- duction to the temple at Hierapolis, is in perfect agreement with the Herodotean aspect of the work. The sanctuaries in question enjoyed considerable prestige in the Hellenistic world, a reputation they owed in part to their commendatory description by Herodotus.89 The fact that the author of DS gives Greek names to the deities of Hierapolis is also in keeping with the classical ethnographic tradition inaugurated by Herodotus. Finally, in his account of the divergent religious tradi- tions in Hierapolis, the author clearly shows a preference for stories that agree with Greek myths and history. His predisposition is most transparent in his preference for Dionysos over the other founders of the sanctuary, but it can also be seen in his account of the Flood hero Deucalion and the Seleucid queen Stratonice.90 Since the Hellenistic features are typical of the accounts of Greek visitors to Syria and the Near East, the conclusion has often been drawn that DS is the account of a man of Greek culture. Because the author of DS claims to be a Syrian, it is assumed that he abandoned his Syrian identity for a Greek cultural identity.91 However, although the author of DS was certainly influenced by Greek culture, the Hel- lenistic features do not necessarily imply that he had abandoned his Syrian identity altogether. By the second century AD, various cities in Syria were centres of Greek culture, and the author of DS might very well have originated from one of them.92</page><page sequence="13">The Author of De Dea Syria 165 There are, in fact, quite a number of elements in DS which point to the Syrian heritage of its author. It is regrettable that the atten- tion to the Hellenistic traits in the work has led to a neglect of the equally or more important 'native' elements. The thread of Syrian self-esteem which runs through DS points to a Syrian as its author. As will be argued below, this self-awareness is expressed in two ways. On the one hand, the author assimilates Hierapolis to Greek culture, thereby making it part of the Hellenistic world. On the other hand, he differentiates Hierapolis from the Greek world and aims to show that the cult in Hierapolis is superior to Greek religion and unique in its kind. Interestingly, he uses Greek devices to illustrate this supremacy. However, he is not an uncritical copyist and refutes contemporary Greek views on Hierapolis and the Syrian goddess that affect the unique character of the cult. As such the DS intends to propagate the cult of the Syrian goddess in the Hellenistic world. Given the Syrian self-consciousness, Hellenized Syrians must have been most receptive to the ideas expressed in this work. Probably they were the audience the author had in mind when he wrote his work Herodotus' work not only provided Greek and Roman writers with a method to investigate the customs of foreign countries, but also stimulated non-Greek writers who, especially after Alexander, ex- pounded the characteristic features of their own culture to a Greek or Hellenized audience.93 Though some of these writers felt that Herodotus was in need of correction,94 the Histories did provide them with an adequate model to express their religious patriotism. They followed Herodotus by stressing the antiquity of their religion, argu- ing that many Greek beliefs did go back to these earlier strands of culture.95 The author of DS was apparently well aware of Herodotus' respect for foreign religions. In imitation of Herodotus, he cites the prestigious sanctuaries along the Syrian coast to prove that Syrian re- ligions are older than Greek beliefs, and therefore superior to them.96 The author goes beyond Herodotus, however, by his claim that the sanctuary at Hierapolis surpasses the Phoenician temples in sanctity.97 It is for this very reason that he describes the spontaneous oracle of</page><page sequence="14">166 Lucinda Dirven the Hierapolitan Apollo; he explicitly states that he mentions it for its unique qualities.98 By copying Herodotus, then, the author of DS invests a Syrian shrine with the cultural prestige of the Histories, and thereby brings it within the pale of Hellenism.99 The author's interpretatio Graeca of Hierapolitan deities and cus- toms does not imply that he was a foreigner. Bilingual inscriptions prove that it was quite common amongst Syrians to identify their local gods with Greek divinities. By the second century AD this practice had spread from the traditional centres of Hellenistic culture to more 'local' cultures, such as Palmyra and Sia (Jebel Hauran).0oo Historians have labelled the Hellenized foundation myths of Hierapo- lis inauthentic and thus non-native.'0' However, despite the fact that these Greek myths do not represent the original Semitic traditions, they may well have been popular amongst the Hellenized people in Hierapolis. In other words, the authentic Semitic traditions should be distinguished from the different cultural traditions that circulated at Hierapolis in the second century. 02 DS contains several indications that Greek culture had influenced some inhabitants of the 'Holy City'. In all likelihood, part of the population of Hierapolis adhered to the tradition according to which Dionysos founded the sanctuary in honour of his mother Hera, for this is consistent with the attribution of the semeion to Dionysos.'03 The story that the Seleucid queen Stratonice built the most recent temple shows how the inhabitants furnished Hierapolis with a history in accordance with Syria's Hellenistic past. Not all Greek ideas were accepted by the Hierapolitan population, however. Their rejection of the Greek custom of worshipping Apollo as a youth, illustrates their critical attitude and religious self-consciousness.'04 Like the inhabitants of Hierapolis, the author of DS did not accept all Greek traditions with respect to the sanctuary and its goddess. This fact supports the hypothesis of his Syrian identity. The author's interpretation of three Hierapolitan foundation myths (viz. the Flood legend, the tale of Semiramis, and the account according to which the sanctuary was founded by Attis for his mother Rhea) illustrates this point. At the beginning and the end of his account of the Hierapolitan</page><page sequence="15">The Author of De Dea Syria 167 Flood tradition, the author observes that the Hierapolitan story agrees with the Greek myth.105 However, the story as told in Hierapolis deviates in several respects from the Greek account and clearly goes back to a Semitic version of the story.106 The differences between the Hierapolitan version and the Greek myth are so apparent, that it is unlikely that a Greek writer would have made this mistake.107 In order to uphold the Greek cultural identity of the author of DS (i.e., Lucian of Samosata), it has been suggested that the writer deliberately made this error in an attempt to satirize Eastern traditions.10s It goes without saying that this explanation presupposes the Lucianic authorship and the satirical character of DS. Once this preconception is recognized for what it is, the argument can just as well be reversed, for non-Greek writers in their turn accused the Greeks of distorting the religious traditions they had borrowed from the East. The best example of this point of view can be found in the Phoenician History by Philo of Byblos, a contemporary and fellow countryman of the author of DS.109 Like Philo, the author of DS stresses the antiquity of Egyptian and Syrian religion over Greek beliefs. His 'errors' in the Deucalion tale may very well have been intentional; they are to be viewed as corrections of the Greek version of the Flood Story on the basis of the Eastern myth.o10 The author of DS rejects the tradition according to which the Hi- erapolitan temple was founded by the Assyrian queen Semiramis in honour of her mother Derceto."' This legend was widespread in the contemporary Greek and Roman world and goes back to a tale re- lated by the Greek historian Ctesias in the Persica.112 Unlike his predecessor Herodotus, who thought Semiramis was a historical per- son, Ctesias deified the legendary queen by making her the daughter of the goddess Derceto."3 According to Ctesias, Aphrodite incited Derceto of Ascalon to love a young and mortal man; from this im- proper love affair Semiramis was born. Burning with shame, the goddess abandoned her daughter in a deserted place, threw herself into the lake near Ascalon, and changed into a fish. The future queen was miraculously raised by doves, and after a long and prosperous reign she herself turned into a dove at her death. In the course of</page><page sequence="16">168 Lucinda Dirven time, Greek and Latin authors identified Derceto of Ascalon with the Hierapolitan Atargatis, and apparently some inhabitants of Hierapolis were familiar with this identification.114 The author of DS rejects the identification of Derceto with the goddess from Hierapolis. This has surprised modem commentators, for both Derceto and Atargatis are Greek renderings of the Aramaic name of the goddess."1 However, the common etymology is not at stake here for the author was well aware that Derceto was one of the names of the goddess of Hierapolis. What he rejects is the assimila- tion of the Ascalonite Derceto and her locally determined mythology with the Derceto of Hierapolis."16 In order to prove that they are two different goddesses, the author points out their differing iconography. Apparently, he is well aware that Ctesias' story is the ground for the assimilation of the two goddesses, and his counter-arguments show that he considers this to be a foreign tradition.117 He indirectly disso- ciates himself from Ctesias' account by denying Semiramis' divine nature and thus her alleged descent from Derceto. We are told that the Assyrian queen forced her subjects to worship her as a goddess, but that she recovered from her madness after she was punished by the gods."8 Foreigners were intrigued by the typical Syrian custom to treat fish and doves as sacred animals. From Ctesias onwards, Greek and Roman authors had explained this peculiar tradition by means of the story of Derceto.119 In contrast, the author of DS denies the applicability of Derceto's story for Syria as a whole. The story of Derceto is typical for Ascalon and cannot be used to explain the local traditions of Hierapolis with respect to sacred fish and doves. The author of DS also discards the tale according to which the sanctuary was founded by Attis for his mother Rhea, i.e. Kybele. Contrary to the other foundation myths that were current at Hierapo- lis, this legend does not seem to have had many adepts in the city, for the author twice stresses that he heard the account from one learned man.'20 This intellectual based his hypothesis on the close resem- blance between the cult statues of both goddesses, and the important role of eunuch priests in the two cults. To outsiders these similarities must indeed have been striking, and it is therefore not surprising that</page><page sequence="17">The Author of De Dea Syria 169 Kybele and Atargatis were frequently identified outside Syria. Unlike Kybele, Atargatis' cult was never officially recognized, and a deep distrust of this exotic goddess and her castrated priests prevailed in the Roman world.121 At best, she was considered a manifestation of her esteemed Anatolian 'sister' and was venerated as such in Ky- bele's temples.122 Contrary to the Greek and Roman assimilation of the two goddesses, DS stresses the unique and locally determined character of the Hierapolitan goddess. Thus the castration rite in the Hierapolitan cult is explained by means of the story of Stratonice and Kombabos, an account which is inextricably bound up with the temple in Hierapolis. The same holds true for the iconography of the Syrian goddess, for according to the author of DS, her image not only resembles that of Kybele, but "also has something of Athena, Aphrodite, Selene, Artemis, Nemesis and the Fates. On the whole, however, she is certainly Hera", i.e.: Atargatis, the unique Syrian goddess from Hierapolis.123 Conclusion It may be concluded that the author of DS was strongly influenced by Hellenistic culture and tried to bring Hierapolis within the pale of Hellenism. However, this does not imply that he was a foreigner. DS should be read as a patriotic work by a member of a subjected nation who challenges the cultural superiority of the Greeks with respect to the 'barbarian' countries. Interestingly, this assertion of self-esteem is made by adopting the language and arguments of his adversaries. Thus the author assimilates Hierapolis with Greek culture in order to emphasize its unique and superior qualities. His Syrian cultural identity comes to the fore most clearly in his critical stance towards Greek traditions that affect the unique character of Hierapolis and its goddess. The work therefore intends to propagate the cult of the Syrian goddess to a Hellenized audience, in all probability from Syria itself. The author of DS may be characterized as a Syrian with a Greek ed- ucation, who consciously clings to the national culture he inherited.124</page><page sequence="18">170 Lucinda Dirven This implies that DS should no longer be read as the satirical account of a man who had espoused Greek culture. Instead, it offers a Graeco- Syrian interpretation of the writer's native religion and culture. As such, it provides valuable and trustworthy information on at least one of the religious and cultural traditions that were current at Hierapolis in the second century.

A summary statement of the arguments against the authencity of the Astrology is offered by Betz, Lukian von Samosata, 25. Several Ionic passages in Lucian's writings-Dom. 20 and Vit. auct. 3-show that he was capable of imitating this dialect. A recently discovered writing by Lucian's contem- porary Gallen, proves that Lucian was capable of composing an entire work in the Ionic dialect. Gallen relates that Lucian fabricated a work of Heracleitos in order to expose a well-known philosopher: G. Strohmaier, "Ubersehenes zur Biographie Lukians," Philologus 123 (1979), 326. 26 For a survey of comparable themes in DS and Lucian's writings see: Bompaire, Lucien ecrivan, 646-648; Anderson, "Studies in Lucian's Comic Fiction," 68-78; Oden, Studies, 41-42.

Drijvers, "Hierapolis (Mabbog)," RAC 15 (1991), cols. 27-41, esp. 31, make it appear as if the satirical character of DS does not affect the assessment of the reliability of the account. 39 According to Cumont, Religions orientales, 107; Goossens, Hierapolis de Syrie, 21-22; Morin, Cult of Dea Syria, iv, the author of DS omits the theology of the Hierapolitan priests. Although many historians of late antique religion in Syria presuppose such a theology, there is hardly any proof of its existence: Drijvers, "Persistence of Pagan Cults," 35, n. 4-6. 40 This is acknowledged by most commentators. Recently: Attridge and Oden, The Syrian Goddess, 3; Oden, Studies, 43-46; Bilde, "Atargatis/Dea Syria," 163. 41 This is not taken into account by Goossens, Hie'rapolis de Syrie, 21-22 and 134-139, and Bilde, "Atargatis/Dea Syria," 151-187. 42 Local circumstances have determined the development of the cult of Atargatis in various places in Syria and Mesopotamia.

However, it follows from the DS that the cultural situation in Hierapolis must have been more complex than the author's di- chotomy between popular and official religion. The various explanations offered</page><page sequence="26">178 Lucinda Dirven by the inhabitants of Hierapolis with respect to the religious phenomena prove that several cultural traditions co-existed in the city. In my view, second-century Hier- apolitan culture was a composite phenomenon that functioned as an organic unity for the inhabitants and the visitors in their religious practices: Drijvers, Cults and Beliefs at Edessa, 17 and 175-177. It is for this reason that I refute the analysis of Baslez, "L'auteur du 'De Dea Syria'," who pictures Hierapolitan culture too mono- lithic when she states on p. 174 that: "...le religion hierapolitaine avait garde sous l'Empire ses caracteres semitiques anciens de culte agrare." Although an interpreta- tion based upon Semitic traditions was current in the city, it was by no means the only tradition by which religious phenomena were explained. 103 DS ?33. Compare below, n. 120. 104 DS ?35. 105 DS ?12. 106 This has been widely acknowledged. See Oden, Studies, 24-29, for an enu- meration of the arguments and references to previous studies. 107 According to some commentators Lucian of Samosata accidentally confused the Semitic story from his youth and the Greek version: Helm, "Lukianos," 1761; Goossens, Hierapolis de Syrie, 19 and 40-50; Betz, Lukian von Samosata, 165; Morrin, Cults of Dea Syria, 27-30. I find it hard to believe that a well-educated man like Lucian made such a mistake by chance. 108 Oden, Studies, 24-25 and 29. 109 Especially in 805: 4-25 of the Phoenician History: A.I.

See also Van Berg, Corpus II, 32; Goossens, Hierapolis de Syrie, 20; Oden, Studies, 98-100. 116 Drijvers, Cults and Beliefs at Edessa, 84, n. 25, stresses the locally determined manifestations of the Syrian goddess. 117 The author of the DS may be correct in his judgment, for the story was possibly made up by Ctesias: Van Berg, Corpus II, 20. 118 DS ??14 and 39.</page><page sequence="27">The Author of De Dea Syria 179 119 Van Berg, Corpus II, 25-26. 120 In constrast, the author states that the story of Deucalion is told by "the majority of the inhabitants," the story of Semiramis by "others", and the story of Dionyosos by an unspecified "them". The inferior role of the legend of Kybele also follows from the various traditions with respect to the semeion, ennumerated in DS ? 33. Contrary to the other three foundation myths, the story of Kybele has not determined the interpretation of the semeion. 121 Most famous is Apuleius' account of the priests of the Syrian goddess in MWtamorphoses VIII. 122 Turcan, Cultes orientaux, 139. 123 DS ?32. This can rightly be said to be one of the most famous passages of DS. The passage is often cited to illustrate the syncretistic character of Atargatis. See for example M. Horig, Dea Syria. Studien zur religiosen Tradition der Frucht- barkeitsgbttin in Vorderasien, (Neukirchen-Vluyn 1979), esp. 247-261. Given the context of the passage, the enumeration does not necessarily reflect a syncretistic development of the goddess, for it lists the attributes of her cult statue. It does not automatically follow from these iconographic similarities that the Syrian goddess also adopted other characteristics of these goddesses: Drijvers, "Book review of M. HOrig," 391. Again, the quest should not be for the origin of the goddess, but for the meaning of the passage in the context of the DS as a whole. 124 Contra Millar, Roman Near East, 503-522, who doubts that such a consciously Syrian group of people existed in Late Antique Syria. In my view, the assimilation of Syrians to Greek language and culture did not necessarily imply that they completely abandoned their Syrian heritage. The DS illustrates how Syrian culture could be re- interpreted according to Greek standards with maintenance of its local characteristics.</page></plain_text>
