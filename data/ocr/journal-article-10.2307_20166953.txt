XXVII.</page><page sequence="2">Sculpture and the concept of the double among the Inca kings MAARTEN VAN DE GUCHTE Sculpture occupied a very important symbolic space in Inca society and cosmology. One of its functions was to commemorate points of cosmological interest in the lands controlled by the Incas during the so-called Late Horizon in the Andes (ca. A.D. 1300-1532). At present, large carved rock complexes, located at selected points in Tahuantinsuyu, are the only remains of Inca activity and creativity in stone.1 In the ethnohistoric literature these large-scale sculptures, called huaca, saywa, or huanca, are frequently mentioned. In addition, smaller movable sculptural pieces were created by Inca sculptors. Unfortunately only the names of these smaller artifacts have been preserved, not the material forms themselves. Descriptions given in the chronicles illuminate the context and operations of these statues in a very intriguing manner. As products of Inca sculptural practice, the statues claimed sectors of the same symbolic space as carved rocks. For that reason, a reconstruction of the appearance and significance of these statues will clarify aspects of the Inca attitude to sculpture and aesthetics. One particular group of these effigies occupied a very significant niche in the social and religious hierarchy of the Incas. In Quechua, these sculptures were called huauques, literally "brothers."2 This group of brother-statues has been documented with sufficient detail by Spanish chroniclers to enable a fairly thorough analysis. Sculptures made of stone, of gold, and even of hair, were assigned the role of "brothers" of the Inca kings. The literary sources for this concept are very intriguing. In their, writings, various sixteenth- and seventeenth-century authors discuss the form and material of the brother-statues, their economic aspects and functions, and the locations where these statues were found. Brother-statues as companions were not limited to the hierarchically elevated royalty in Inca society. It is known that a small number of Andean deities and huacas were also accompanied by a brother-statue. Other important questions, such as whether there were any female counterparts of these brother-statues and what these stone-brothers looked like, are treated in part by the Spanish authors. Collecting the fragmented data on the huauques, some of these questions can be answered. It will also become apparent that the grouping of king and brother-statue most likely included a third element in the form of a "son-statue" for reasons of genealogical and dynastic stability. The Jesuit author Jose de Acosta in his Historia Moral of 1590 provides the following definition of the term huauque: The Incas were not satisfied with this idolatry of the bodies of the deceased, but they also made their statues and each king made, during his lifetime, a statue of himself of stone which he called huauque, which means brother; because to that statue, alive or dead, one had to show the same veneration as to the Inca [king] himself; these [statues] they took to their wars and in processions to procure water and favorable weather and they made different feasts and sacrifices [for them]. Of these idols there were many in Cuzco and its vicinity; one should understand that the superstition to adore these stones has ceased completely or in great part, after they were discovered due to the diligence of the licenciado Polo de Ondegardo; and the first (of these statues) was that of Inca Roca, principal head of the moiety of Upper Cuzco. 1954:147 The information on these brother-statues is limited, often fragmented, and contradictory. However, the available data make evident that the brother-statue constituted an important religious and political category, integrating symbolic and dynastic aspects that are intimately linked with concepts of sacred kingship. The notion that an effigy of a living king can extend his authority after his death, temporarily and symbolically, is also known from late medieval England and France (Giesey 1960). The mortal remains of the old king would be buried within days, while an effigy would serve as the focal point of the state ceremony. It served to further the idea of the continuity of the living king (i.e Roi est mort! Vive le Roi!), and an elaborate legal argument was constructed in medieval England to separate the notion of the material and natural mortal body of a king from that of the immaterial and immortal body politic which he represented (Kantorowicz 1957). It appears that the Incas were confronted by a similar 1. This essay is an adapted version of a chapter in my dissertation on Inca monumental sculpture and landscape (Van de Guchte 1990). I would like to thank R. Tom Zuidema and Francesco Pellizzi for critical readings of an earlier manuscript. 2. Huauque is spelled in different ways by the various colonial authors; we encounter huayque, guaoqquen, huauque, and comparable spellings. I will use the spelling huauque or the English term brother-statue.</page><page sequence="3">258 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 problem, and their solution is quite interesting.3 A list of the brother-statues of the Inca kings has been reported in two different documents; one list is included in the Historia Indica of Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa (1572) and the other in the Historia del Nuevo Mundo of Padre Bernab? Cobo (1653). Both authors made use of the papers, now lost, of the licenciado Polo de Ondegardo, a Spanish official who discovered most of these royal statues. Polo's main objective had been a search for the mummies of the Inca kings and the extensive estates which were associated with these embalmed royal bodies. Polo's writings and the activities they covered date to the 1550s. Some years later the viceroy Marques de Ca?ete ordered the transfer of three or four of the mummies found by Polo to Lima where they were exhibited in a context mingling aspects of the sixteenth-century Wunderkammer with a religious auto-da-f?. By then the stone-brothers must have been lost or destroyed, because no mention is made of these statues in documents covering the Lima showing (Hampe 1982). Comparing Sarmiento's data with Cobo's information, it is clear that both authors had access to the papers of Polo de Ondegardo, and Sarmiento occasionally mentions additional intriguing details, presumably based on an oral historical tradition. A general schema, indicating the order of kings, the names of the brother statues as given by Sarmiento and by Cobo, and a list of the places where these statues were found by Polo de Ondegardo, will help bring some clarity to these dispersed notions. Inca dynastic lists have come to us in a variety of ethnohistoric documents, without exception solicited by the Spanish imperial bureaucracy or manipulated by indigenous informants to conform to Spanish genealogical concepts. As is well known, mythological and pseudo-historical elements in these lists of kings constitute a colonial discourse that obscures the historicity and character of Inca kingship. Early in this century, Eduard Seier advanced the theory that the series of recorded Inca kings should be considered as elements of a double monarchy divided into two moieties: one moiety (in Spanish, parcialidad) belonging to Upper- or Hanan-Cuzco and the other to Lower- or Hurin-Cuzco.4This duality seems to be confirmed by the geographic distribution of the discoveries made by Polo de Ondegardo in the valley of Cuzco between 1559 and 1561. Prior to European contact, the Inca political system was expressed symbolically in the placement of the ten royal mummies in the Golden Enclosure, the temple of Coricancha in Cuzco. They were seated on both sides of a golden image of the Sun: five Hanan mummies and five Hurin mummies. These ten mummies represented the ten royal panacas or lineages; they also had a calendarical function associated with ten specific months in the Inca year, complemented by two ayllus (lineages) of pre-lncas and one group of non-lncas who fulfilled ritual roles in three additional months. Following the European invasion, these mummies, huauques, and associated paraphernalia were withdrawn from Coricancha and hidden in various locations in the countryside surrounding Cuzco (Zuidema 1992; de Bock 1992). Table 1 presents a list of the names of the kings, their corresponding huauques, and the locations where the material remains of the brother-statues were found. This table will facilitate the reading of the ethnohistoric record with its rich but occasionally confusing texture. The data about the huauques, their names, and appearance, seems fragmented and capricious. But actually, this mutilation may be connected with the genealogical and dynastic claims that the various informants of Polo, Sarmiento, Cobo, and Betanzos were trying to make. For instance, the information on the brother-statues for the kings of Hurin-Cuzco is more limited than for their counterparts from Hanan-Cuzco. A larger number of names of brother-statues for the kings from Hanan-Cuzco has been recorded than for these sculptures from Lower Cuzco. Sarmiento mentions the mythical first Inca king Manco Capac as the initiator of this cult of the brother statues, writing: With him the idols guauquis started, which was an idol or devil that every Inca [king] elected as his companion, and it gave him answers as an oracle; the idol guauqui of [Manco Capac] was the bird 'indi.' 1942:61 3. Two other authors have treated the issue of the huauque in earlier publications. Ricardo Latcham analyzed these "stone-brothers" as totemic devices (1928:120-126). More recently, Duviols has called attention to the strong link between the huauque and the huanca, the lithified ancestor, normally placed in the center of an agricultural field (1979b). Cf. also Duviols 1972:104. 4. The dual nature of Inca kingship and society has been analyzed in great detail by Zuidema (1964, 1990). Cf. also Duviols 1977.</page><page sequence="4">Name of king 1.

And this was the idea that Manco Capac gave and he took great care of [the bird], keeping it in a cage made of straw in the manner of a small box. . . . When Manco Capac felt close to death, he left this bird to his son Cinchi Roca, together with the topayauri which is a sceptre, and the napa and the sunturpaucar, princely emblems, although he was a tyrant. Ibid., p. 52 Padre Bernab? Cobo does not give these particulars about the brother-statue of Manco Capac. His version is the following: They all held it for certain that they descended from this Manco Capac; that is why his body and idol was worshipped by all the families and ayllos. . . . Polo Ondegardo could not discover the body of Manco Capac, because (it appears) his descendants never had it; before they believed that he was transformed into stone, and they said that he was [a stone] that Polo found, dressed and well kept, in a village close to Cuzco, that was called Membilla. 1964:67 The brother-statue of the second Inca king Sinchi Roca was described by Sarmiento as follows: Sinchi Roca left an idol of stone, figure of a fish, called Guanachiri Amaro, which was his idol guaoqui during his lifetime. This idol, together with the body of Sinchi Roca, was found by licenciado Polo, in the village of Bimbilla, in between some bars of copper, and the idol had his personnel of servants and field to sow. 1942:63 Cobo's description of Sinchi Roca's brother-statue is almost word for word identical with Sarmiento's description quoted above, except for some orthographic differences (for example, Huana-chiri-amaro and Membilla (Cobo 1964:68)). No information is given by Sarmiento about the brother-statue of the third Inca king Loque Yupanqui, nor about the fourth. Padre Cobo mentions that the third king "took with him an idol, his goaoqui, called Apo Mayta" (Sarmiento 1942:64). Matters are complicated by the fact that the same name is given by Cobo to the brother-statue of Capac Yupanqui, the fifth Inca king. The Jesuit author reports that: "The idol that [Capac Yupanqui] left had the same name as his ayllo, i.e. Apu-Amayta" (Cobo 1964:70).</page><page sequence="5">260 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 Concerning the sixth Inca king, Inca Roca, these details are provided by Cobo: The body of Inca Roca, together with his idol of stone that represented him, with the name of his ay//uVica-Quirao, was found, well kept and with great authority, in the small village of Rarapa . . . when there was need of water for the planted fields, it was custom to bring it out in a procession, richly dressed and the face covered and they took it through the fields and the punas; and they believed that this was important so it would rain. Ibid., p. 73 Information about the brother-statue of the seventh king is not given. Both Sarmiento and Cobo provide identical information about the eighth king, Viracocha Inca. His body had been sacked from its burial place in Caquia Xaquixaguana by Gonzalo Pizarro. The remaining ashes were recovered by the Indians and hidden in a small jar, which was discovered together with his idol guauque called Inga Amaro by Ondegardo (Sarmiento 1942:83; Cobo 1964:77). More detailed information is available about the brother-statue of the ninth king Pachacuti Inca. When he died, his body was taken to the village of Patallacta, where he had built some houses to bury his body, as Sarmiento reports: They buried him by putting his body underground in a large, new earthenware jar. His body was dressed in rich clothes and Ynga Yupangue ordered that on top of his sepulcher a golden bulto was to be placed, made in his image and in his place. The licenciado Polo found the body of this Inca in Tococache, where nowadays is the parish of San Bias in the city of Cuzco, well taken care of and well kept, and he sent it to Lima on order of the marquis of Ca?ete, viceroy of this kingdom. The idol guaoqui of this Inca was called Indi i I lapa; it was made of gold and very large, which was taken in pieces to Caxamarca. Polo found a house, inheritance, servants and wives of this idol guaoqui. 1942:217 Cobo lists the name of the brother-statue as Inticllapa and adds that the body of Pachacuti Inca was first buried in Patallacta, from where it was brought to Totocache. About the state of the mummy, Cobo writes: His body was very well cured (preserved) with a certain paste and confection, so that it seemed as if he were alive. His eyes were made of a cloth of gold ('telilla de oro'). . . . He was very well dressed with four or five rich mantles, the headband of the king and other I lautos that were finely woven. 1964:82 Topa Inca Yupanqui, the tenth Inca king, had a brother-statue by the name of Cuxi churi; it was found in Calispucyu, where the Indians had hidden it and made many sacrifices to it (Sarmiento 1942:138). His body had been burnt by the captains of Atahualpa, when they took his grandson Hu?scar prisoner (Ibid., p. 88). The body of [the eleventh king] Guayna Capac was found by Polo in the city of Cuzco in a house. ... It was taken care of by two servants, one was called Gualpa Tito and the other Suma Yupangui. His idol guaoqui was called Guaraqui inga, which was a large idol of gold; it has not been found yet. Sarmiento 1942:151 Many attempts were made by the Indians to prevent the discovery of the body of this king Huayna Capac. That is clear from the words of Cobo: When the Spaniards had entered in this land, they put a lot of effort in finding the body of this king [Huayna Capac]. Finally it was discovered on the road of (or towards) the fortress [of Sacsayhuaman] in a house where it had apparently been brought the night before ... the indians moved it around to many different sites . . . but always they moved it in the company of five or six idols, which they worshipped greatly, because they were convinced that these idols were knowledgeable about guarding the body of the Inca. 1964:94 In this particular case, it was the mummy of the king Huayna Capac, that formed the object of this frantic search of the Spaniards. From the same source we know that the heart of Huayna Capac was kept in Tumibamba and his body in the palace of Casana in Cuzco.5 Huayna Capac's reputation and mummy were described by Pedro Sancho de la Hoz, who was among the first Spaniards to enter Cuzco. Judging by the details given by him, he may actually have seen the brother-statues and related statues within their original Inca setting. He wrote: Guarnacaba [sic; should be: Guayna Capac] was well obeyed and almost adored, and his body is in the city of Cuzco, intact, wrapped in rich textiles and only the point of his nose is missing. There are other images made of plaster or of clay, which have only hairs and nails which they cut and the clothes in which he was dressed in his lifetime; these ?mages are so venerated among those people as if they were their gods. They bring them frequently to the main square with music and dances, and they attend them, day and night, chasing away the flies. 5. The custom of separating the heart and intestines of a deceased royal personage is also known from thirteenth-century France. Although it first was done for purely practical reasons, it soon took on symbolic forms (cf. Erlande-Brandenburg 1976).</page><page sequence="6">Van de Guchte: Sculpture and the concept of the double among the Inca kings 261 When some important lords come to see the cacique, they first go to salute these figures and only afterwards the cacique. 1968:334 No information is available about the brother-statue of the king Hu?scar, who was killed during the turmoils of the Spanish entry into Peruvian territory. A bit more is known about Atahualpa, the pretender to the throne, who was ultimately captured and killed by the Spaniards: And Cuxi Yupangue ordered that the bulto of Atagualpa, which they called Ynga Guauqui [Brother of the Inca], should be placed in a certain house of the city [of Cuzco], so that all could revere it and serve it in place of their lord. Betanzos 1987:279 In Miguel Cabello Valboa's Miscellanea Antartica (1586) the name of this brother-statue is given as Ticci Capac. 77cc/ is the Quechua word for an Andean Figure 2. Sculptural head (back). Inca with postconquest retouchings, sixteenth century. Diorite. H: 38 cm. Museo de America, Madrid. From Larrea 1960:pl. XXVIII. concept indicating "foundation" or "origin." Cabello Valboa wrote that "the Orejones of Cuzco showed obedience to the statue of their Lord Atahualpa (that he always took with him) which they called Ticci Capac, which means lord of the final regions of the earth" (1951:459). Juan de Betanzos noted earlier about Atahualpa's brother-statue that "Quizquiz said to Chima who was in charge of the bulto which they held in stead of Atahualpa that he should take it and hide it in Xaquixahuana" (1987:281 ). The full extent of this reference is that while Atahualpa is kept prisoner by the Spaniards, royal authority and privileges have been transferred to his brother-statue who is being cared for by Atahualpa's generals and troops. The concept of "the king's two bodies" has been taken here to its practical extreme. What did these brother-statues look like? Have any been preserved, one might ask. Following their detection by Polo de Ondegardo in 1559, royal mummies and statues were assembled by the licenciado in a cabinet of curiosities, so characteristic of the sixteenth century. Garcilaso de la Vega reports to have seen them in Cuzco in early 1560 and part of this Wunderkammer was sent by Polo to the Viceroy Ca?ete in Lima (Hampe 1982). None, it appears, have been preserved, with one possible exception. A sculptural head of a male, at present in the Museo de America in Madrid, could have been part of a brother-statue. Although most certainly retouched in colonial times (the wrinkles around the eyes look distinctly non-pre Columbian), the royal headfringe (llautu) indicates a personage of royal ancestry6 (see figs. 1-2). A material evolution can be appreciated in the sequence of brother-statues, as described in the ethnohistoric literature. The first sculptures are described as being made of stone. The companion to the first king, Manco Capac, is described as a "dressed" stone, most likely an amorphous stone covered with textiles. The second brother-statue, also made of stone, had the "figure of a fish." What kind of sculpture could a sixteenth-century Spaniard have seen to select this description for an Incaic work of art? Judging by part of its name, amaro, this fish was probably a stone representation of the feared mythological serpent. 6. Larrea 1960, pis. XXVII and XXVIII. This piece was found in the 1930s in Cuzco during construction work for the Palacio de Justicia. It was acquired for the Collection Larrea, which later passed to the Museo de America, Madrid. A torso, upon which the head could be fitted, was found in the same location some 30 years later. That fragment is now displayed in the courtyard of the Casa Municipal in Cuzco.</page><page sequence="7">262 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 Formal or iconographie descriptions for the next huauques are lacking. Only in the case of the sixth king, Inca Roca, is the "face" of the brother-statue mentioned. From this moment on, one might assume that a statue with general anthropomorphic traits is being manufactured. Three generations later, mention is made of a different material. Pachacuti Inca, the ninth king, had a brother-statue of gold "made in his image." Similarly, the eleventh king Huayna Capac had an "idol of gold" as his brother-statue. Based on these scant descriptions, two categories can be distinguished. The brother-statues of Inca Roca and Sinchi Roca, the first kings of both Hanan- and Hurin-Cuzco, are described as being made of stone. A first distinction appears to be between "ancient" kings, associated with stone, and later kings, who are rendered in gold. In addition, the brother-statues associated with Upper-Cuzco kings have facial and anthropomorphic characteristics, while the Lower-Cuzco brother-statues are either amorphous or have faunal characteristics. Here some lines from a report written by Juan de Betanzos in 1551, eight years before Polo de Ondegardo discovered the brother statues, provide the following details: Of the nails and hairs which they had cut [of Pachacuti Ynga] during his lifetime, he ordered that a bulto was made and so it was done in that village where the body was kept and from there they took this bulto in a litter to the city of Cuzco . . . and there they put it in the houses of Topa Ynga Yupangue.7 1987:149 Betanzos gives a description of rites still in full swing, notwithstanding the presence of Europeans on Peruvian soil. From this text it appears that one statue (bulto) made of gold was kept near the body of the deceased Pachacuti Inca and another statue, made of hair and nails or perhaps containing hair and nails in its interior, was taken to the palace of his successor. It is not clear from this text whether this statue was a "brother" or fell in a different class of sculptural representation. Topa Inca Yupanqui (Pachacuti's successor) spoke to this statue whenever he wanted to make another statue. Also, the people of the lineage of this Inca king were responsible for taking this statue of Pachacuti Inca out to the various rituals in the city of Cuzco. Betanzos does not give the name of the brother-statue of Pachacuti Inca. The same tradition is observed at Yamque Yupanqui's death (a king only mentioned by some chroniclers). He also is honored with a golden bulto placed on top of his grave and a separate bulto made of nails and hair for worship by the people (Betanzos 1987:166). Due to their hierarchical status, some of the brother statues were accompanied by other statues, resulting in a cluster of sculptural elements resembling a royal court. A sculptural set was created with a royal statue at its center, surrounded by statues of courtiers, real-life wives, and servants. The very important stone idol of the Chanca ethnic group was discovered by Polo in association with the stone-brother of Pachacutec. The Chanca idol served his stone-lord as vassal of a conquered region, each replicating the roles of their real life counterparts. A courtly entourage of this nature occupied a house and possessed fields for cultivation whose care was in the hands of specially designated servants. Two of these caretakers are known by name: GualpaTito and Suma Yupangui who served the brother statue of Huayna Capac (Sarmiento 1942:151 ). The stone-brothers were given the same treatment and privileges as other lords in the Inca hierarchy. In the words of Bernab? Cobo: The kings assigned to these huauques a house and personnel, and gave them some property for the support of those who were in charge of these [huauques]; and they ordered their people, and particularly those of their lineage and kin group (linaje y parcialidad) that they should give the same reverence, from the day that they were constituted as their brothers, as to their own persons. 1964:162 The spatial distribution of their tombs follows the same pattern as the territorial divisions over which their "king-brothers" were in charge (fig. 3). Upper- and Lower-Cuzco stand out in clear contrast here. The kings of Hanan-Cuzco were all laid to rest in places within that particular part of Incaic Cuzco. Rarapa (Larapa) is a site still known within the boundaries of San Sebastian, just to the East of Cuzco. Caquia Xaquixahuana is a tomb, nominally within the hierarchically superior sector of Hanan-Cuzco, but at a fairly large distance from the city of Cuzco, on the site of what is popularly known as "Huchuy-Cuzco," opposite the village of 7. Commonly sculptural objects were addressed by the Spaniards as bultos. The following entry can be found in a Spanish dictionary, entitled "Tesoro de la Lengua Castellana, o Espa?ola", compiled by Sebastian de Cobarrubias Orozco and published in Madrid in the year 1611. Cobarrubias defines the word bulto as follows: "Bulto: Everything that is voluminous, and which is difficult to distinguish what it is, such as what one carries underneath a cape" ("Todo aquello que haze cuerpo y no se distingue lo que es"). Further on Cobarrubias adds these particulars: "Sometimes 'bulto' means the effigy placed on top of the sepulcher of a prince, and sometimes even the covered tomb itself." And he continues: "Figura de bulto": "That what is made by a sculptor, when it is a three-dimensional figure."</page><page sequence="8">Van de Guchte: Sculpture and the concept of the double among the Inca kings 263 Caquiaxaquixahuana Calispuquio Sacsayhuaman X ?* Aucaypata (Plaza de Aimai Hanan-Cuzco Kenko O Patallacta Coricancha *4W Hurin-Cuzco Bimbilla i 500m Figure 3.

Totocache falls within the limits of the barrio of San Bias in the city of Cuzco, while the earlier burial place of Pachacuti Inca was Patallacta. Patallacta is still known as a site with carved stones on the northeastern outer city limits of Cuzco, but that identification is problematical. Finally, Calizpuquio is known as a huaca within the cegue-system and can be identified with a field close to or within the fortress Sacsayhuaman. Recent excavations in the archaeological park of Sacsayhuaman, coupled with an analysis of the relevant ethnohistoric data, suggest that the sunken circular courtyard to the north of the great walls was related to Calizpuquio (Van de Guchte 1990). Bimbilla or Membilla, the place where the remains of Sinchi Roca, a Hurin-Cuzco king, were found, can be identified as Wimpillay, a location to the south of the river Huatanay, within the territory traditionally identified as Hurin Cuzco. Also in Lower-Cuzco is Cayoacache, where the tombs of Loque Yupanqui and Mayta Capac were found by Polo, now located within the modern-day parishes of Belen and Santiago. It is important to point out that there are no female counterparts to the brother-statues. There are no reports about "stone-sisters" to Inca kings. The corresponding word in Quechua kinship terminology would be pana, that is, a man's sister. It appears that this form of kinship was not reified as a sculptural object, but its importance was reiterated in the concept of panaca, which means royal lineage. Stone-sisters to Inca queens are not mentioned either, although in a limited number of cases, statues of females have been described. One example will serve to highlight the differences between male and female sculptures. The king Huayna Capac was born in Tumibamba (the present day city of Cuenca</page><page sequence="9">264 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 in Ecuador). His affection for that city was so great that he made it "the capital of the Empire of lower Peru" (cabeza de Ymperio del el Piru inferior) and embellished it with a number of superb palaces. One of these royal compounds was Mulo Camcha (should be read as Mullucancha): And as decoration of this [palace] he ordered a portrait to be carved, a natural likeness of his mother Mama Ocllo, of very pure gold, and in her stomach he ordered that was to be put the very same afterbirth of her [when she had given birth to Huayna Capac], because it was a custom to keep this foul matter when the Queens or Princesses had given birth to a son, and with this idle relic he put a great quantity of gold and silver in this imitation of a stomach. Cabello Vaiboa 1951:365. Here we have a description of the image of an Inca king's mother, a statue with this curiously hollowed-out stomach to contain bodily relics. The word huauque or its female equivalent has not been used. But in a different place in his narrative, Cabello Vaiboa gives the following piece of complementary information. The king Huayna Capac was confronted with a mutiny among the rank and file of his troops. He was treated with such arrogance by the military that the situation appears beyond control. Then he ordered his priests to take the statue of his mother out of the temple "covered with sad clothes," together with the other statues in the temple. When the priests appear with the statue of Mama Ocllo: an indian woman, from the Ca?ar, started to speak with the voice of this idle ?mage, and representing her person [and] pulling her hair, scratching her face which was streaming with tears. This woman, who acts as the double of Mama Ocllo, holds a long homily, exhorting the troops not to forsake the cause of her, and also their mother. Ibid., p. 374 A number of differences come to light. First, the statue is seen in all instances as the image of Mama Ocllo herself; in no way is there any indication of the statue being attributed the genealogical position of sister. The Ca?ar woman acts as her representative? speaks, tears her face, pulls her hair, and sheds tears, all in a very public manner. This stands in sharp contrast with the behavior of the stone-brother, who only talks in private with the Inca king. The silent stone-brother, who is the lithic companion of the living Inca king and stays with him also in death, can be contrasted with the screaming, very much alive Ca?ar woman, who temporally acts for the statue of the Queen. The statue of Mama Ocllo has been carved after her death; the brother-statue of the Inca kings is carved during his lifetime. Mama Ocllo is dead; it is her statue that comes alive through the intermediary of the Ca?ar woman. In the case of the Inca king, it is his huauque that acts as an intermediary with the world of future things and with the realm of death. Who had a brother-statue in pre-Columbian Peru apart from the Inca kings? Antecedents in Andean culture to the Inca brother-statue complex can be found in the ethnohistoric literature on the north coast of Peru, more specifically the kingdom of Lambayeque (ca. a.D. 800-1350). The first ruler of this kingdom, by the name of Naymlap, was accompanied by: an idol carved in a green stone, [called Yampallee], which means figure and statue of Naymlap . . . this was the guaca or idol that Naymlap took with him. . . . This idol was made in the likeness of the face of the caudillo Naymlap. Cabello Vaiboa 1951:327 It seems acceptable to equate this statue called Yampal lee (after which the valley of Lambayeque has been named) with a brother-statue in the Incaic sense of the term. It appears to indicate that the idea of a stone companion for a king was an ancient pan-Andean concept. Returning to the Inca materials, the relationship between huauques and huacas (sacred locations or objects) has not been discussed yet. In the list of huacas along the forty-one imaginary ceque-lines dissecting and empowering the sacred geography of the valley of Cuzco, three huauques are mentioned. Inti i I lapa is mentioned as the guauque of Pachacuti, confirming information given by Sarmiento (Cobo 1979, Chinchaysuyu 2:3). Two other brother-statues are reported, associated not with Inca kings but with deities. The first is Turuca, indicated as the guauque of Ticci Viracocha, the Creator God, which has the form of an "almost round stone" (ibid., Antisuyu 1:2). If Turuca can be read as a misspelling forTunupa, the implications of this name become infinitely richer. The association between categorical denominator (brother statue), name (Tunupa refers to an Andean ancestor god), and description ("an almost round stone") effectively articulates the complexities of Inca aesthetic discourse. Finally there is Chucu ylla (Chuqui ilia), mentioned as the "brother" of the idol of the Thunder (in Pucamarca) (Cobo 1979, Chinchaysuyu 5:2). It may be recalled that a similar name was recorded by Cobo for the brother-statue of the ninth king, Pachacuti. Of all the Inca kings, Pachacuti Inca is the only one whose brother-statue is represented as a huaca on one of the ceque-lines. The apparent contradictions in the texts may be seen as evidence that the king Pachacuti Inca</page><page sequence="10">Van de Guchte: Sculpture and the concept of the double among the Inca kings 265 had more than one brother-statue. One may have been made of gold, and another (or others) were made of stone. The Sun also had a brother-statue. In addition, the Sun had a second companion-statue, a son-statue. Polo has described it as such: "In Coricancha there were three statues Apo Inti, Inti Churi and Inti huauque." Acosta elaborates upon this information: The three statues of the sun were called Apu Inti, Churi Inti and Inti Huauque, which means Lord Sun, Son Sun and Sun Brother and in the same manner they named the three statues of Chuqui Ilia, who is the god who presides in the region of the air where it thunders, rains and snows. Acosta 1954:172 These triads of statues, associated with the Sun and Thunder deities, may actually represent the original and authentic model of royal and sacred companionship. As noted above, Betanzos mentioned a statue of Pachacuti Inca, made of hair and nails, in addition to his brother statue made of gold. These data, in the light of the information given by Acosta on the statue of the Sun, can be interpreted as referring to two statues, one acting as huauque, or brother, and the second statue acting as churi, or son. The triad of sculptural representations appears to have been constituted in the following way. During his lifetime, the "persona" of the king was seen as the apu, or lord, in this triad. A sculptural piece functioned as "brother" while one of the king's sons took on the role of companion-son, similar to the role of the statue as companion-brother. After the king's death, roles and ritual positions would shift. His mummy then took over the most important hierarchical position in the triad. The brother-statue served as companion to this deceased lord, while a second statue would be manufactured to assume the role of "son." The data referring to the brother-statue of the king Topa Inca Yupanqui seem to confirm this interpretation. The name of the "stone-brother" of this son of Pachacuti Inca was Cuxi Churi, which can be translated as "Happy Son." Why a "brother" of stone should be addressed by a king as "happy son" may baffle us. A possible interpretation might be that this stone-brother of the tenth king Topa Inca Yupanqui had earlier on been a companion to the ninth king Pachacuti Inca in the capacity of churi, or son. It is possible that for reasons of dynastic continuity or political expediency, Topa Inca Yupanqui decided to maintain the name of Cuxi Churi for his own brother statue. It appears that the inherent tension of this dual model was kept in balance through the addition of a third element, a "tertium ego," forming a triadic structure of lord, his brother, and his son. As such, the triadic structure presents the lord and father at its center, protecting and projecting itself over a horizontal genealogical distance through the inclusion of the "brother" and over a vertical genealogical distance through the inclusion of the "son." This could have been a mechanism in the Inca empire to reinforce dynastic hegemony and cohesion and to prepare and preserve dynastic continuity. There is another category of inanimate objects, which are addressed with terms indicating familial relationships (paternal, fraternal, and sororal). The brother-statue of Manco Capac was the bird Indi, as we have seen in the report by Sarmiento, but in another chronicle it is said that the mountain Huaunacauri was the huauque of Manco Capac. This information does not necessarily contradict the version of Sarmiento; on the contrary, it extends the relationships of a sibling network among brother-statues into the area of ritual topography with mountains and other conspicuous sites as its focal points. Accounts given by early Spanish chroniclers of indigenous religious institutions describe a hierarchical organization of huacas, or sanctuaries, utilizing genealogical terms to indicate religious and political interdependence of temples and ritual places over a very large area. Hernando de Santill?n, writing in 1553, reports that the most important huaca on the Peruvian coast, Pachacamac, had four sons located in four valleys lying between Pachacamac and Cuzco in the highlands (Santillan 1968:59). These four brothers, through their paternal relationship with the deity Pachacamac and their political relationship with Cuzco as the center of the Inca empire, demarcated an area associating the sacred powers of Pachacamac with the Inca in Cuzco. Similar genealogical clusters of huacas were replicated on lower levels of the religious hierarchy, defining smaller areas of ritual topography. In a prayer to "All the Huacas/' three huacas in three towns are named as sons of Ureos Viracocha whose temple was just outside Cuzco in the town of Urcos (Molina 1988:84). Here, as in the Pachacamac example, a hierarchical paternal relationship is expanded into a precise ritual topography through fraternally related shrines of equal religious importance in different geographical regions.8 The "stone-brothers" of the Inca kings fall in a category by themselves. Although they partake in aspects of religious thinking common to other 8. Cf. Poole 1984 for ethnographie details regarding these networks.</page><page sequence="11">266 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 categories of man-made or natural imagery, such as huacas and huancas, there are a number of important distinctions. The huauque is primarily a companion to the king. This companion fulfills a number of oracular functions, counsels the king when necessary, and acts as his representative, receiving the same honorific attention as the king himself. The brother-statue also assists the king in war, acting occasionally as his representative. In a different, agricultural context, the brother-statue serves as an advocate for the people, invoking water for their fields. It appears that no female counterparts to the brother-statues ever existed, at least they have not been reported in the ethnohistoric sources. Duviols saw a strong link between the huauque and the huanca (stone most often found in a field as protector of that area), both being duplications, in his opinion, of ancestors and culture heroes. But there is an important difference to point out. The huanca qua stone is always the result of a process of transformation, that is, the ancestor who has turned to stone. In contrast, the statue-brother is manufactured during the lifetime of the portrayed, in the likeness of the king. An aesthetic volition and artistic process distinguishes the genesis of the brother-statue. The only exception to this rule is provided by the huauque of Manco Capac that appears miraculously and disappears in an equally miraculous manner. The huauque functioned as an alter ego to the Inca, his Zweites Ich, his double or twin brother (Zerries 1962). In the oral traditions of Huarochiri, similar ideas are to be found; in one instance a myth is told about a miraculous box from which a light is shining. This light materializes as a princess. The king Huayna Capac does not want to leave this beautiful young woman and orders a man of his ayllw. "And you, my double, my likeness (mi doble, mi semejante): Proclaim, 'I am Huayna Capac,' and return to Cuzco." Thereupon he disappeared with this lady.9 Here the double acts as a stand-in for the lusty king (Avila 1975:75). The stone brother-statues represented much more than mere state portraits. They contained the soul of the ruler, his camaquen' (Duviols 1977). As such they were revered, not as the soul itself, but as the container of that soul. That soul or camaquen' was a synonym for another closely related concept, that of upanV which is the shadow, the spirit of a person. In this domain of shadow and spirit, of king and his double, the brother statue contained the camaquen', translated by Domingo de Santo Tomas in his Vocabulary as "the soul thanks to which we live" (1951 ).10 Finally, it is the inclusion of stones as kinsmen in the culture of the Incas that reiterates the integration of genealogy and aesthetics.11 The study of Inca aesthetics and ethnoaesthetics has yet to come of age, but the presence of terms like brother and son as elements in this aesthetic discourse brings to mind similar semantic mechanisms in Greek art and aesthetics. One of the first terms to be used in the eighth century B.c. in Greece to denote a piece of sculpture was kolossos, a literal reference to the cadaver of the portrayed (Vernant 1977, 1978-1979). In Peru, the Inca king had a sculpture made in his likeness, referred to it as his brother, talked with it, and took it into war. The evident psychological dimensions of this relationship can only be surmised. Brothers are frequently at odds, and it was not different in Inca society. When the king Hu?scar was captured by the captains of his brother and rival Atahualpa, he was subjected to a number of humiliations. Most telling in this context is, as Guarnan Poma de Ayala reports, that Hu?scar was given a large stone dressed as a woman for a wife (1987:f. 389 [391]). The "tragic inca" did not have the comfort of a brother-statue as companion, but rather that of a "female" stone in his last hours. The king Hu?scar must have sensed that his chances for dynastic hegemony were very bleak. 9. Another example of a double in the Huarochiri text is: "The priest, the double or "personero" of the huaca [Llocllayhuancu] went out to say . . ." (p. 97). Cf. also p. 108 and p. 124. 10. ". . . camaquen: el alma por el cual vivimos." 11. On the continuity of these beliefs, see, for instance, Nash (1979:151) on stone images as huauques.</page><page sequence="12">Van de Guchte: Sculpture and the concept of the double among the Inca kings 267 BIBLIOGRAPHY Acosta, Jose de 1954 Historia Natural y Moral de las Indias (1590).
