<plain_text><page sequence="1">A sociolinguistic view of hazl in the Andalusian Arabic muwashshah DAVID HANLON Birkbeck College, London The documented history of the theory of the muwashshah and one of its constituent parts, the kharja, spans almost 800 years: from Ibn Sana' al-Mulk (d. 608/1211) to the present day. Apologists for the various theories broadly belong to one of two schools, which for the sake of convenience I shall label 'integralist' and 'partialist'. The integralist view holds that the muwashshah is an indivisible poetic unit with a coherent internal structure; partialists, on the other hand, divide the muwashshah into two separate units where certain linguistic criteria are applicable: the main body of the muwashshah in Classical Arabic and the kharja if it employs a Romance and/or Arabic vernacular. Despite the fact that his views are quoted by some partialist critics in support of their claims for the genesis of the muwashshah, I regard Ibn Sana' al-Mulk as the founder of the integralist school, following Van Gelder. The latter has examined the extent of critics' study of the coherence and structure of Arabic verse in an important survey of medieval Arabic literary theory.' In a poetry in which more than one subject is treated in the same composition, critics naturally devoted attention to the means of transition from one theme or motif to another. The transitional devices fall into two categories.2 The first is termed takhallus or khur@j; these refer to the transition from nasTb (erotic prelude) to rahTl (description of journey and mount) or madi.h (panegyric). The second is termed istitrad and is commonly translated as 'digression'. It was coined by the Abbasid poet Abii Tammam to describe a means of apparently talking about one subject while in fact describing another; as an example, the poet cites one of his own compositions in which he appears to be describing a horse but is in fact deriding one 'Uthman. It came to refer to a deviation from one subject to talk about another, and then to return to the original subject. The terms khur@j and takhallus on the one hand, and istitrad on the other, were often confused. Medieval critics employ them to refer to devices by which the internal coherence of a poem suffers no rupture when a thematic digression occurs, for example Ibn Tabataba: The poet has to make subtle connections between the various subjects (funun) of his discourse. Thus he makes a transition (fa-yatakhallas) from love poetry to panegyric, from panegyric to complaint, from complaint to request; ...by the subtlest of transitions and best of representations (bi-altaf takhallus wa-ahsan hikaya), without any motif being broken off from the one preceding it, but connected with it and mixed with it.3 and Ibn Khaldfin: Then he [the poet] starts a new speech in another line, in the same manner; and he passes on (yasta.trid lil-khur@j) from one subject (fann) to another, from one aim (maqsad) to another, by preparing the first aim and ideas in 1 G.

Clearly for Ibn Sana' al-Mulk the transition from the final aghsn of the muwashshah to the kharja was one that did not compromise the structural integrity of the poem despite changes of theme or linguistic variety. Although the integralist approach has not won many adherents in modem scholarship, a number of recent studies have made significant contributions to it: Kennedy has scrutinized thematic aspects of the muwashshah within the tradition of Classical Arabic literary theory and from a more Andalusian perspective;7 Rosen-Moked has studied in depth what Ibn Sana' al-Mulk terms khuri@j and istitrad, or the mechanisms in the final aghsan by which the trans- ition to the kharja is made;8 and Menocal, whilst recognizing the legitimacy of the partialist practice of isolating the kharja from the muwashshah in dia- chronic studies, makes an eloquent plea for more synchronic analysis within an Andalusian framework, rather than the classical framework favoured by Ibn Sana' al-Mulk.9 The defining characteristic of any partialist approach to the muwashshah is the belief that its kharja has its origin in a popular tradition of Romance lyric poetry if it employs elements of a Romance vernacular. It is perhaps unfair to characterize it as an approach to the textual analysis of the muwashshah, since it is often motivated by the study of peninsular and European literary history, as typified by the studies of Alonso and Menendez Pidal.`o However, syn- chronic textual analysis of the kharja is frequent among students of medieval European literature such as Dronke." It is a common, but not universal, belief among partialists that the connection between the main body of the muwash- shah and the kharja is loose and artificial. In a field of inquiry in which disagreements traditionally inspire a good deal of acrimony, differing synchronic analyses have respected the fact that 4 Van Gelder, Beyond the line, transl., 191.

I suspect that it is for the claims it makes in this regard, that an integralist theory of the muwashshah propounded by Abu-Haidar has yet to receive the credit it deserves.12 The distinction that Ibn Quzman draws between hazl and classical verse (ash'ar) in zajal 65,13 and a passage by Ibn al-Khatib in which he gives notice of Abii 'Abd Allah b. Baq's mastery of hazl and 'the hazl-like literature used in al-Andalus' (al-adab al-hazli 'l-musta'mal bi-'l-Andalus),14 are perhaps evid- ence that hazl was recognized in al-Andalus as a distinct literary genre. It was characterized by an obscene and frivolous thematic content, the optional use of a vernacular and a freedom from the constraints of classical literary tradition; in contrast, the tradition of formal mu'rab demanded a respect for literary convention and the use of the standard written language. Abu-Haidar makes a cogent case for regarding some kharjas (typically those which are not pan- egyrics), as elements of hazl introduced as light relief after the ponderous mu'rab of the main body of the muwashshah. The aim of this paper is to provide a sociolinguistic context for the assessment, within an integralist tradi- tion, of the kharja as an element of hazl within the muwashshah, by examining the degree to which al-Andalus was a bilingual and diglossic speech community, and the degree to which such bilingualism and diglossia influenced attitudes towards the linguistic varieties used in the muwashshah. I wish to stress that the term hazl in the foregoing discussion is to be understood as a descriptive label; its relation to the ihmdd of Classical Arabic literature with reference to a theory of the origin of the muwashshah is neither affirmed nor denied.'5 Throughout much of its history, al-Andalus was characterized by varying degrees of bilingualism and diglossia. There are two broad categories of the former: societal and individual. Societal bilingualism involves the use of two languages in one unit of political organization which is typified either by a territorial division between two speech communities (for example Belgium), or by a speech community's use of a language that is different to that of the larger political unit of which it is a part (for example, Catalonia). Linguists have coined a long list of terms to refer to degrees of individual bilingualism: additive, subtractive, compound, coordinate, dominant, incipient, productive, symmetrical, asymmetrical, etc. The paucity of extant data relevant to the study of Romance/Arabic bilingualism in al-Andalus does not justify such detailed qualification; I shall limit myself to the use of two terms, functional and receptive bilingualism, that are appropriately broad in their reference.16 Functional bilingualism is circumscribed at one extreme by a limited knowledge of grammar and vocabulary to perform a finite number of tasks in a second language, and at the other by a native-like control of a second language with limited phonological, syntactic and lexical interference from the first language which, although detectable by monolingual speakers of the target language, does not seriously hinder the communication of ideas. Receptive bilingualism is said of an individual who is capable of understanding the written and/or 12Jareer Abu-Haidar, 'The kharja of the muwashshah in a new light', Journal of Arabic Literature, 9, 1978, 1-13. 13 Ibn Quzman, Gramdtica, metrica y texto del cancionero hispanodrabe de Aban Quzmdn, ed.

It is difficult to provide a complete account of Andalusian bilingualism based solely on the small number of cases of individual bilingualism cited by contemporary authors writing in Latin and Arabic, and although modern scholarship has plausibly suggested that there was a concentration of monolin- gual speakers of Romance in rural areas,"7 there is no direct commentary on the distribution of linguistic competence according to sex, social class, ethnic origin or religious affiliation. However, the linguistic consequences of conquest and the social and economic hegemony of the invaders parallel those of the military and economic subjugation of Wales by England. Both situations lend themselves to analysis within a view of societal bilingualism formalized by Fishman, in which L(anguage),, of the intruding power class, is the language of the means of production (capital, plant and organization), and L(anguage)2, of the subjugated population, is the language of manpower.'8 In order to win social, economic and political mobility, speakers of L2 (Welsh or Romance) are required to adopt L, (English or Arabic) with no reciprocal pressure on speakers of L, to adopt L2; the reservoir of monolingual speakers of L2 is thereby greatly reduced and its existence threatened.'9 The situation is exacer- bated if L, enjoys currency beyond any immediate political boundaries, as is the case in Belgium where there is a higher incidence of French/Flemish bilingualism among those who regard Flemish as their first language since French is a gateway to the outside world in a way in which Flemish is not. The circumstances conducive to the trend from Welsh monolingualism to Welsh/English bilingualism were created when the Statute of Wales of 1536 and 1542 disallowed Welsh status in administrative and legal structures.20 During the Industrial Revolution, Wales became an important centre of coal- mining and iron-smelting: workers were overwhelmingly speakers of Welsh; the majority of owners and managers were overwhelmingly speakers of English. By this time English had also dislodged French as the principle international lingua franca; consequently, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the number of Welsh/English bilinguals rose dramatically and the number of Welsh monolinguals fell commensurately.21 Parallels are not evident in al-Andalus during the conquest and the first decades of settlement for two reasons: speakers of Arabic and Berber were outnumbered by speakers of Hispano-Romance and were forced to marry within the latter speech community; and an Arabo-Islamic social and cultural infrastructure had yet to establish itself. The knowledge of Romance displayed by Sulayman b. Aswad al-Gafiqi, judge of the great mosque of C6rdoba during the reign of the emir Muhammad (238-83 A.H./A.D. 852-96), is perhaps evid- ence of more widespread functional, or at least receptive, bilingualism among the invaders and their descendants at an earlier date.22 It was from the ninth 17 Federico Corriente, Arabe andalusi y lenguas romances (Madrid: Editorial Mapfre, 1992), 34. 18 Joshua A.

Consequently, those individuals who wished to better themselves socially and economically, and who might have regarded Romance as their first language in an earlier age, became functional Arabic/Romance bilinguals. The oft-quoted Indiculus luminosus of Alvarus is testimony to the enthusiasm for Islamic fashions, and the language for which they were a vehicle, among the youth of the capital.23 It was only natural for the young and upwardly-mobile of C6rdoba to imitate the fashions and linguistic habits of the ruling classes, and regard their native Romance traditions with scorn. We have biographical sketches of a number of these individuals, especially those who embarked on careers as physicians in the ninth and tenth centuries;24 for example, Jawad the Christian Physician (al-tabfb al-nasran-) and Khalid b. Yazid b. Ruman the Christian (al-nasrdani. The reputation of the latter extended beyond the borders of al-Andalus (he corresponded with the Egyptian physician Nastas b. Jurayh), and enabled him to acquire great wealth and estates through the practice of medicine. Ibn Malhika the Christian (al-nasrani) also enjoyed a prosperous practice; he required 30 chairs to seat waiting patients during surgery hours. Little is known of IshIq the Physician, except that he was a Christian (masTh- 'i-nihla), and the father of the most successful of this group, Yahya b. Ishaq. The latter converted to Islam,25 became vizier to the caliph 'Abd al-Rahman III and was appointed governor of Badajoz. The adoption of Islam as a way of life and Arabic as a means of communication similarly enabled one al-Habib, of Romance-speaking parents (kana abd'uhu 'ajaman), to pursue a legal career and rise to the top of the Andalusian judiciary in the early tenth century.26 As in Wales, the economic and social supremacy of an invading force initiated a trend among the indigenous population from monolingualism to bilingualism which gained momentum because of the inability of Romance to compete with Arabic as an international language of culture and commerce, and culiminated in Arabic monolingualism in areas such as eleventh-century Toledo. A contemporary observer, Ibn Hazm, presaged some of the conclusions of modern sociolinguistic inquiry concerning the relationship between language and political power: [In the case of] a people that suffers the loss of its political dominion and is ruled by its enemies and filled with worries, one can be sure that its ideas will die and it is even possible that its own language will disappear.27 Diglossia is defined by Ferguson in a seminal paper: DIGLOSSIA is a relatively stable situation in which, in addition to the primary dialects of the language (which may include a standard or regional standards), there is a very divergent, highly codified (often grammatically 23 Text and translation in David J.

However, subsequent to the process of imitation of Eastern cultural models in the ninth and tenth centuries, all members of the Arabic-speaking population with a modicum of education were diglossic in varying degrees. The cultivation of a genre which censured the numerous phonological, syntactic and lexico-semantic features of spoken usage not codified by classical grammarians, the lahn al-'amma literature, is concrete evidence of diglossia in this period. Its first Andalusian exponent, al-Zubaydi (316-79 A.H./A.D. 928-89), undertook to con- tribute to this body of writing when he noticed that his predecessors in the Eastern Islamic world had failed to comment on features peculiar to al-Andalus: ...then I scrutinized the spoken usage of our time and country and found sentences that Abii Hatim [al-Sijistafn] and other linguists had failed to mention among the [examples] they cite, of language which our populace had corrupted, changed its form (ahalu- lafzaha) or altered its meaning (wada"'ihu ghayra mawdi"ihi).29 Outside the muwashshah, Romance was committed to writing either in contexts which are consciously colloquial (the zajal), or as glosses for technical terms (botanical dictionaries). Otherwise it must be assumed that it was used only for informal spoken purposes, and was therefore a L(ow) variety in common with spoken Arabic, and in contrast to the H(igh) variety, Classical Arabic. All speech communities have strong attitudes towards varieties of their own language and the languages of other speech communities. Many varieties are stigmatized and intimately related to regional stereotypes. The Upper Egyptian (sa'idi) is typically regarded as stupid and backward; /g/ and /3/, as opposed to /?/ and the plosive jTm of Cairo, are an integral element of the stereotype. New York City English is stigmatized in a similar way as 'Brooklynese', and is imitated by many Americans for comic effect.30 Diglossia and bilingualism encourage such attitudes. In diglossic societies, L is regarded as decidedly inferior to H. In Morocco, H is associated with beauty, richness and is considered to be the language that Moroccans should use most;31 presumably, L is neither beautiful nor rich and should be spoken least by Moroccans. Societal bilingualism often fosters negative attitudes towards one of the two languages because its speakers are more numerous in the lower socio-economic strata; British government commissioners reporting on the use of Welsh in 1847 make no attempt to disguise such attitudes: 28 Charles A. Ferguson, 'Diglossia', Word, 15, 1959, 336. 29 Quoted from 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Ahwani, 'Alfafz maghribiyya min kitab Ibn Hisham al-Lakhmi fi lahn al-'imma', Majallat ma'had al-makhtitit al-'arabiyya, 3, 1957, 133. 30 William Labov, The social stratification of English in New York City (Washington DC: Center for Applied Linguistics, 1982), 19. 31 Abdelaili Bentahila, Language attitudes among Arabic-French bilinguals in Morocco (Clevedon: Multilingual Matters, 1983), 31-2.</page><page sequence="7">HAZL IN THE ANDALUSIAN ARABIC MUWASHSHAH 41 ...a peculiar language isolating the mass from the upper portions of society ...the Welsh element is never found at the top of the social scale ... his language keeps him under the hatches. ...the Welsh language is a vast drawback to Wales and a manifold barrier to the moral progress and commercial prosperity of the people ... it bars the access of improving knowledge to their minds.32 It is well known that the term that most commonly denoted Romance in al-Andalus, "ajamiyya, carried negative connotations in a linguistic tradition initiated by the pre-Islamic peoples of northern Arabia, who called themselves 'clear speakers' ('arab) in contrast to foreigners, or 'confused speakers' ('ajam), whose language they could not understand.33 The tradition was per- petuated by the Quran, in which 'ajamT and its morphological cognates are invariably contrasted with 'clear Arabic speech' (Q. 16:103, 26:192-8). Since it is more than likely that the monolingual speaker of Romance in al-Andalus was condemned to a menial profession and life in the lower socioeconomic strata, the negative connotations of 'ajamiyya probably widened to accommod- ate associations with poverty, a backward outlook on life and rural simplicity. The literary consequences of these attitudes for a contemporary audience depend on whether the muwashshah belonged to the domain of H or L. Internally H was its principle medium: of the five constituent stanzas of those compositions that contain snatches of vernacular speech, at least four are couched in the literary standard. Although there is no compelling reason to argue that externally the muwashshah belonged to the domain of H to the exclusion of L, the medieval critic Ibn Khalduin does document instances of recitation in the formal literary salon (majlis) during the tenth and eleventh centuries: dd.hikun "an jumdn by al-A'ma-; jarriri 'l-dhayla ayyamd jarri by Ibn Ba-jja in the majlis of Ibn TIfalwit of Saragossa; and the recital by Ibn Zuhr of ma ladhdha lT sharbu rlahi of al-Abyad in order to defend the latter's reputation as a washsh.h.34 It must be assumed, therefore, that at least on some occasions in such contexts the use of vernacular Romance and/or Arabic was an intrusion that had a comic effect, an observation first made, to my knowledge, by Forster: This literary use of what was otherwise a non-literary language doubtless imparted a certain piquancy to the poem, parallel perhaps to that produced in a diglossic, not bilingual, situation in Pygmalion.35 Perhaps an analogue closer than Pygmalion can be found in the dramatic literature of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spain, which reflected contem- porary sensitivity towards speech and dress as indicators of the difference between urban and rural life-styles. The rustic stage jargon, sayagues, con- trasted sharply with the prestige variety of Castilian spoken at Toledo that was the primary vehicle of dramatic expression. Its use carried strong associ- ations of a rustic type who was crude in manners and dress, stupid and the speaker of a language described as 'bumpkin' (pastoril, rtistico), 'coarse' (grosero) and 'comic' (gracioso).36 32 Bellin, 'Welsh and English', 462. 33 W.

The 135 poems in the Arabic corpus that employ vernacular Arabic exclusively are, from this point of view, typologically equivalent to the 42 that use Romance (or an admixture of Romance and Arabic). I shall therefore examine three poems by way of example: the first employs vernacular Arabic in its kharja; the second and third employ predomi- nantly Romance on the basis of all textual reconstructions attempted thus far. Thematically and stylistically, 'Bi-abT 'ilqu bi-'l-nafsi 'alTq' by 'Ubada is a rather conventional piece characteristic of the amatory muwashshah which makes it useful for the purposes of illustration.37 Within the framework adopted here, the first four stanzas constitute the mu'rab, the kharja constitutes the hazl, and the point at which the transition from mu'rab to hazl is made occurs in the final aghsan of the fifth stanza.38 The mu'rab is devoted almost entirely to a description of the love object which relies heavily on the ghazal clich6 to the extent that it may be considered a catalogue of its stock elements. The beloved has a round and shining face like a moon: I have fallen in love with a crescent moon ... A full moon that shines with well-proportioned beauty. A full moon that triumphs with shining magic. When he appeared [like a full moon], dragging the trains of beauty behind him ... His cheeks glow with red and white floral hues: Lily-of-the-valley besieges a well-protected rose, A curl of hair like a scorpion's tail upon jasmin. His glances are like arrows that pierce the lover's heart: Armies of beauty [dwell] on his eyes, And the glance plumed with licit magic. His saliva, like wine, intoxicates the lover: His mouth is a wine jar made to be kissed. His teeth are white and symmetrical like a string of pearls: His teeth mock the pearl necklace [surpassing it in beauty]. References to the physical attributes of the love object are invariably cloaked in metaphor, mentioned in succession, and little regard is shown for establishing a syntactic relationship between them. The description is not mimetic, and relies for its internal coherence not on any logical structure expressed through conjunc- tion and coordination, but on the juxtaposition of elements and the understood background of a literary cliche. The beloved is an archetype, of which a small number of elements are selected for representation in a collage, whose abstraction is best articulated by the poet himself in the second stanza: 'there appeared to me a being created for love' ('anna IT khalqu bi-'l-'ishqi khalTq). The aghsin of the final stanza mark a change in tone and style: 37 Text from Sayyid Gazi, Diwdn al-muwashshahit al-andalusiyya (Alexandria: Mansha'at al-ma'arif, 1979), I, pp. 169-71. On the identity of tfiis poet see Samuel M. Stem 'Muhammad Ibn 'Ubada al-Qazzaz, un andaluz autor de muwasiahas', Al-Andalus 15, 1950, 79-109. 38 cf. Rosen-Moked, 'Towards the kharja', a study to which I am greatly indebted in the analysis that follows.</page><page sequence="9">HAZL IN THE ANDALUSIAN ARABIC MUWASHSHAH 43 After he had clothed himself in the garb of beauty, I desired to kiss his delicious, dark red lips, But he refused, quoting a verse, And leant over coquettishly With the sweetest of diction: In this post-coital scene, while the reference to the garb of beauty maintains a level of abstraction that is not incongruous with the preceding mu'rab, a narrative, more concrete style predominates which is expressed most readily by the opening reference to a concrete time frame (lammd) and the succession of past simple verb forms: 'he clothed' (tasarbal); 'I wanted' (aradtu); 'then he said' (fa-qdla); 'and then he leant over' (wa-mala). The animation and direct speech render the love object more tangible and human. The kharja follows: And qul ququ Itls bi-llh tadhuqu. 'I say, [here's] a titbit, by God you will not taste it.' This literal translation belies a dramatic change in register which is marked by common features of Andalusian spoken Arabic: and qul, an approximation of the Western Neo-Arabic first person singular of the incomplete tense,39 vs. Classical aqulu; the negative iTs vs. Classical 1d; the object pronoun -u- vs. Classical -hu; and finally ququ (' titbit'), a word of unknown origin but whose duplicated CV syllable identifies it as a creation of child language.40 The thematic shift that accompanies the fall in register (from H to L) is appro- priately downward (from amatory to bawdy). The beloved teases in childish language ('look what I've got-but you can't have any'): 'titbit' can be understood as an anatomical reference which perhaps requires no gloss, and which an idiomatic translation of the kharja might profitably exploit. In sum, the mu'rab is a lofty and highly-stylized example of amatory poetry; the hazl is an informal and bawdy piece of verse. The transition from the latter to the former, istitrad or khurzj in the parlance of Ibn Sana' al-Mulk, is effected in the final aghsan through the introduction of a narrative style and the mainten- ance of thematic continuity. 'Min mawridi 'l-tasntm ', of the same poet, employs mainly Romance in the kharja, which has become a famous anthology piece in its own right.41 In common with 'Bi-ab '"ilqu bi-'l-nafsi 'atiqq' it is a traditional amatory poem and shares its thematic and stylistic structure. The central thematic thread that joins the mu'rab and hazl is the separation of the lover and his beloved introduced in stanza one. The stereotype of the guardian (raqTb) prohibits emotional and physical approaches to the beloved, a situation that obliges the lover to call on the South Wind as a messenger: I love a beloved whose guardian has approached Forbidding that the fruits of his flowers be picked. Oh garden of desires surrounded by hateful things, 39On the development of Western Arabic nfl/nfli1 see Joshua Blau, The emergence and linguistic background of Judaeo-Arabic (Jerusalem: Ben Zvi Institute for the Study of Jewish Communities in the East, 1981), 119-20; John Wansbrough, 'A Judaeo-Arabic document from Sicily', BSOAS, 30/2, 1967, 305-13.

The mu'rab employs further amatory cliches, but interweaves them in a way that, although not without precedent, lends them freshness. The first example is an adaptation of the convention that establishes an opposition between fire (of the lover's passion) and water (of the lover's tears): in the matla', the fire of passion is extinguished not by tears but the beloved's saliva, which in turn does not take the form of wine but of waters from the fountain of the river Tasnim in Paradise. The theme of fire and thirst is reprised in the second stanza to extend the ocular element of the gazelle motif: the murderous glance of the beloved in the direction of the lover is expressed as the gaze of a gazelle urging on its young as it seeks fertile pasture in a waterless desert. Lastly, 'Ubada reinterprets the clich6 of the lover's heart palpitating like a bird in the breast within the context of the branch as a metaphor for the beloved's slender waist: in the third stanza the lover becomes a bird, perched on a supple branch, whose heart races at the sight of the branch's fruit, and despite warnings, falls to its death. The aghsan of the final stanza follow: And a maiden who continues to complain to someone who is unjust Woe to one who is in thrall to one who will not come to help. When, consumed by passion, she saw him delay She sang, when her only hope was to go to him: A change in tone occurs that is similar to, though less pronounced than, the shift that is effected in the transitional verses of 'Bi-ab '"ilqu bi-'l-nafsi 'alTq': from an idealized realm populated by archetypes who are rarely described in anthropomorphic terms, to the more mundane context of 'a certain maiden' (wa-ghadatin), whose movements and utterances are described with a higher degree of realism. This paves the way for the hazl section, or kharja, which takes the form of a quotation by the young woman: m. w sTdTl IbrahTm yi nwamni dalji fdnta mTb dhT nukhti in nu-n sh.nzn kir.sh f-Tr.ym. tTb g.r mt ub 1.g.r-ti 'My lord Ibrahim, oh sweet name, come to me tonight Otherwise, if you do not wish, I will go to you. Tell me where I may couple with you.'42 This colourless translation, in keeping with the tradition of modern kharja scholarship, fails to convey the violent change in register caused by the switch from Classical Arabic to a Romance patois, a highly appropriate vehicle for the section's comic informality and obscenity. A truly idiomatic translation which attached greater importance to connotation might establish l.g.r-ti as its focus. In this instance it is interpreted as a reflex of LIGARE rather than PLICARE, since all the empirical evidence available indicates that Latin /pl-/ suffered no palatalization in the Mozarabic dialects,43 and as a calque of the Arabic root j-m-', particularly form III of the verb jima'a, verbal noun mujd- ma'a (' to have coitus with'). In this way the imperative phrase is a calque of 42 For the text of the kharja and its variants, see Alan Jones, Romance kharjas in Andalusian Arabic muwags'ah poetry (London: Ithaca Press, 1988), 25-33. The use of a point is a typographical convenience which serves to indicate a vowel whose approximate quality cannot be determined from the textual evidence, and is equivalent to the schwa used by Jones. 43 Alvaro Galm6s de Fuentes, Dialectologia moztarabe (Madrid: Gredos, 1983), 86, 175, 201, 232; Leopoldo Pefiarroja Torrej6n, El mozdrabe de Valencia (Madrid: Gredos, 1990), 318.</page><page sequence="11">HAZL IN THE ANDALUSIAN ARABIC MUWASHSHAH 45 the Arabic qul IT ayna mujlma'atT iyydka (' tell me where I may couple with you'). Further semantic interference of Arabic possibly occurs in the cases of in nin &lt;illa ('otherwise '),44 and nwamni dalji, a calque of the Andalusian Arabic diminutive usayyam as used by Ibn Quzman.45 In sum, when scrutinized within its textual and contemporary sociolinguistic contexts, the kharja is not so much an expression of passion of lyrical intensity but a vulgar invitation of the 'your place or mine' variety that contrasts sharply with the sombre tones of the mu'rab, but shares its central thematic concern with the separation of lover and beloved by the raqTb who motivates the request for a secret nocturnal rendezvous. The last example is 'Dam'un safkhun' by al-A'ma al-Tutil (d. 1130/31), in my view the most able of the Andalusian muwashshah poets.46 The mu'rab, hazl and final aghsan are thematically linked by the lovesickness of the lover whose physical symptoms are catalogued in the mu'rab section: burning thirst, tears, sleeplessness, and sword wounds. The prohibitions of the guardian (stanza 1), the glances of the beloved (stanza 3) and the tyranny of the beloved (stanza 4) are identified as the causes of a physical and emotional disequilibrium conveyed by the establishment of several antithetical conceits. The poem begins with a conventional contrast between fire and water: Flowing tears and a burning breast-fire and water have not met except for a matter of great moment. Further examples abound: the guardian seeks for the lover a short life ('amr qasTr) and long torment ('and' tawTl); the beloved displays a harshness (qaswa) that blind passion believes to be tenderness (t-n); and the lover receives tyranny (zulm) in return for his righteous service (insdf). The religious devotion of the lover, in contrast to the faithless aloofness of the beloved, is articulated most forcefully in the second stanza in which the lover yearns to make a pilgrimage to the lover, whom he addresses as Ka'ba, the centre-piece of the Hajj ritual: Oh Ka'ba to whom hearts perform the Hajj Half with love which makes the prayer and half with desire which makes the response, As every moan turns to him repentantly: I am at your behest (labbayka), tell the guardian: Take me on the Hajj and the 'Umra there without denial of desire; my heart is a sacrificial offering (hadly) and my tears votive stones (jimar).47 The final aghsan follow: I have no escape from him in any event. A ruler who lied and treated me with harshness and aloofness Left me in thrall to sorrow and madness And then sang, half-drunk and half-teasing: The transitional verses respect the thematic integrity of the muwashshaha through allusion to the cruel disdain of the beloved, but their articulation of 44 Jones, Romance kharjas, 30. 45 See J.

The kharja takes the form of a drunken utterance by the beloved: m.w al-habTb . nfrm. dht m.w .mar kan .dh sh.ndr bi-nafsi .m.nt. k.shad m. w l. gr. 'My darling [is] ill from loving me. Who will cure [him]? I would ransom my soul for [another] lover who seeks to couple with me.'48 A dry academic register prohibits the use of an idiomatic translation that would do justice to both the intrusion of a Romance vernacular apposite to the thinly-veiled eroticism of the kharja, and al-A'ma's skilled exploitation of the Romance lexis for thematic ends: the 'illness' of the lover (.nf rm.) is not a reference to the stylized lovesickness of the mu'rab but a euphemism for sexual exhaustion which prompts the beloved to seek another partner for carnal gratification. Mention has already been made of l.gdr &lt; LIGARE as a word pregnant with innuendo; k.shad&lt; *CAPTIARE (' hunts ') is perhaps similarly influenced on a semantic level by the language of Arabic love poetry in which hunting and capture often connote sexual pursuit and conquest, as, for example, in zajal 20 of Ibn Quzman: If that prey (dhd 'l-sayd) falls into my hands, oh friends, I will renounce my celibacy and see my hopes realized.49 al-A'ma surpasses the achievement of other Andalusian poets such as 'Ubada or Ibn Baqi through a successful integration of the hazl element into the poem on several levels that inspires in its audience a frisson that follows the initial comic reaction. Despite its vernacular garb, the vernacular kharja's antithetical compound, .nf rm./sh.ndr, echoes the mu'rab's amatory themes and exploits the rhetorical device (tibdq in the jargon of the codifiers of classical badt'), most commonly employed to convey the tension that necessarily follows from the emotional distance between the lover's passionate devotion and the beloved's spiteful detachment; at the same time it is a vehicle for the poem's bawdy element of hazl. Thus it expresses in small compass all the oppositions that the muwashshaha embraces: of theme (amatory vs. bawdy); of style (descriptive vs. narrative); of tone (abstract vs. concrete); and of linguistic variety (high vs. low). To conclude, subsequent to the establishment of an Arabo-Islamic cultural and political infrastructure in al-Andalus from the ninth century onwards, Classical Arabic established itself as the language of high culture and administra- tion, in which formal tuition was necessary in order to attain social and political mobility. Varieties of spoken Arabic and Hispano-Romance were used only for spoken informal communication and became the object of negative evaluation. Romance was further stigmatized because its monolingual speakers were con- fined to a narrow material, and possibly rural, existence. Romance and vernacu- lar Arabic were thus appropriate vehicles for the facetious and frequently obscene element of hazl in the muwashshah, in contrast to the formal and sombre element of mu'rab, which found its natural expression in Classical Arabic.s? 48 This is a speculative text eclectically drawn from strands of the complicated manuscript tradition.
