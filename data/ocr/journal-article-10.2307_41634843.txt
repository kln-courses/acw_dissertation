<plain_text><page sequence="1">Entwined Serpents. By E. Douglas Van Buren (Rome). In Sumerian art there are certain motives or compositions which must have been derived from very ancient prototypes. These motives flourished during the earlier phases of Sumerian culture, but disappeared almost entirely when that art reached its highest level of perfection, although it cannot have been their crudity or inadaptability which led to their disuse, for they contained possibilities of great artistic development. It was because they originated in an exceedingly primitive cultural level, and embodied religious ideas which a more sophisticated mode of thought tended to discard, or at least to express by other forms. At the same time something of their mystic meaning still clung about them, and barred their use for merely decorative purposes. One such motive is that of two serpents entwined which is found as a fully developed design on stamp-seals. A seal impression came to light in the Uruk XII level1, that is to say, in the Al-'Ubaid period, a proof of the great antiquity of the use of seals. Stamp-seals were often engraved with designs derived from the Neolithic Age; they were not patterns arranged solely to please the eye, but had a religious or magical significance, and consequently objects thus engraved acquired apotropaic qualities. A spherical limestone stamp-seal, 50X50X20 mm., was found at Lagash2. Two entwined serpents occupy the middle of the field, and on one side is a qüadruped which may be a lion, on the other a scorpion and a lizard. The scorpion was constantly associated with the entwined serpents, and was part of the astral conception with which the serpent motive seems from the beginning to have been connected. Fragmen- tary stamp-seals from Tepe Qhiyan were adorned with similar designs8, and the motive was carved in very decorative fashion on the ivory handle of a flint knife which was found in Egypt, and which is thought, like other analogous handles, to show Sumerian influence4. These interlaced serpents are perfectly natural snakes; they are not horned, and show no fantastic features whatsoever. Among many primitive peoples the fact that the snake sloughs its skin annually was considered a proof of its power to renew its youth, and thus to live for ever5. By a natural sequence of ideas the serpent was believed to possess healing powers®, and was connected in some legends with man's attempt to gain immortality by casting off his old, worn-out skin, and with it all the diseases and disabilities which had afflicted him. At this point, however, another order i) Jordan, Uruk VB. III, S. 30, Taf. 19, a. 2) AO 6061; Delaporte, Cat. Cyl. Or . du Louvre I, p. 2, T. 23, pl. 2, fig. 9 a - b; Herzfeld, Archäol.

Douglas Van Buren of ideas is often introduced, and the reptile is pictured as an enemy and deceiver who, by a trick, deprived mankind of the ardently desired boon7. It has been stated that "the serpent tended to assume or already had an evil aspect in Babylonia"8, and the legends of Tiamat and of Labbu are cited in proof. Yet it must be remembered that these myths refer to monsters who were not simple snakes, but had many of the attributes of the later dragons, and that in the earliest art of Mesopotamia the serpent is never depicted as hostile to man, perhaps partly because there are few varieties of venomous snakes in that region. Serpents glided out of holes in the ground or out of the water of rivers and canals ; hence they were associated with springs and water- courses. This led to the belief that they were connected with the secret sources of waters which flowed from the underworld, and therefore with the water of life which was found there. In this way the serpent came to be regarded as a chthonic spirit, with wide powers of life and death, healing or destruction. From its association with the underworld the reptile was thought to be lord of the minerals hidden in the earth, and thus able to confer riches; its identification with the sources of rivers and brooks gave rise to the belief that it could impart the blessing of fertility to vegetation in general, and to cultivated products in particular. Deities in serpent form are found in the earliest Sumerian pantheon, and certain of them, for example Nirab and KA.DI, were sometimes spoken of as male, at other times as female. They originated in a period when mankind worshipped the great creative force, for "à l'origine, il semble bien que ce principe soit considéré d'un point de vue général et reste de sexe indé- terminé"9. The entwined serpents are a very ancient illustration of the belief that the serpent embodied the male and female principle, and that their proximity bestowed a blessing on mankind. The study of Dr. Q. W. Locher on serpent-worship among the Indians of North-Western America shows that all the foregoing conceptions concerning the serpent can be parallelled by the beliefs of those Indians10. They believe, moreover, in a bisexual serpent with two heads, one in front, and one at the tail; in certain representations two serpents are depicted; they are "the serpent of the upper- world and the serpent of the underworld, the two halves of the double serpent"11. It seems likely that in remote antiquity a similar belief was held in Mesopotamia, for certain very archaic stamp-seals or pendants represent a human figure with a snake on each side of him 12. A plaque of shell inlay, belonging to the Early Dynastic Period, portrays a "Wild Man" holding in each hand a gigantic serpent13, and in the Iraq Museum a tiny clay model of a couch shows two plump serpents lying side by side with their heads resting on two little cushions. Even the entwined serpents themselves add confirmation to the theory, for the motive represents snakes pairing. Professor Frankfort alludes to the theory in his article on Gods and Myths ori 7) Frazer, Folklore of the Old Testament I, pp. 49 - 52; Langdon, Semitic Mythology , p. 185. 8) MacCulloch, ERE XI: Serpent Worship : Introductory, p. 403. 9) Contenau, Manuel d'Archéol.

Parker, Assistant Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum of Natural History: "I do not doubt that the symbol in which you are interested may well represent two snakes pairing. As a general rule the male seizes the female by the back of the neck and the two bodies are more or less intertwined . . . Vipers . . . are said to have the body completely intertwined". Professor Frankfort, moreover, believes that the motive symbolized a snake-god and that, as numerous examples of this and kindred serpent motives were found at Tell Asmar, they must be the image of an ophidian deity worshipped there, namely the god Ningizzida who, he thinks, was one aspect of Ab-ù, "Lord of Vegetation". There is strong evidence in support of this identification, for Ningizzida's sacred animal was the "lion-bird" and late cylinder seals portray him encircled by serpents or holding a serpent in each hand15. It should be remembered, however, that the "lion-bird" was not a snake, but a species of dragon with certain ophidian characteristics; it was always horned and crowned, and so were the creatures which rose above the god's shoulders. Furthermore, although Ningizzida was assimilated to the snake-god Nirab it is not absolutely certain that they were identical; in the inscription on his seal Ur-Nirab stated that he was "the servant of the god Nirah and the god Ningizzida"16, as if the deities had separate identities. The entwined serpents motive originated in remote ages before whatever gods were then worshipped had received an anthropomorphic, or even a theriomorphic image. Later it occurs at certain sites where up to the present there is no evidence of any cult of Ningizzida. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that at Tell Asmar and other sites where he was worshipped the motive was considered especially akin to him, and it was therefore employed as a ritual symbol in his worship, although it always retained its inner meaning and value as an omen of fertility. One of the earliest representations of the entwined serpents motive on a cylinder seal appears to be in the Morgan Collection (Fig. I)17. It measures 28 mm. in height, diam. 23 mm. The field is divided into two scenes, separated by immense serpents entwined vertically. In one scene a figure crouching in a kneeling attitude, holds a rod in one hand, and a broad-bladed object like a short-handled paddle in the other. A nude man stands in front of him and holds an animal by the neck with both hands; in the second scene two similar figures stand facing each other, one holding an animal, the other an implement used in ritual practices. Heads of animals, fish and a dagger (?), are scattered around, and four small serpents, one on each side of both scenes, sway upright on the points of their tails. The peculiar drawing of the squat, muscular figures, the attitude of the crouching man, even the content of the scenes, which represent the preparation for or performance of a religious ceremony, help one to 14) Iraq I, 1934, p. 12. Lt.-Col. R. H. Elliot, D. SC., FZS., in his article The Adder : Blackwood, April 1934, p. 513, writes: "I have been most emphatically and circumstantially assured by Indians that cobras mate in a vertical position, standing on their tails, twining the upper part of their bodies round each other and swaying from side to side during the act", but he adds that he doubts the accuracy of the story. 15) Van Buren, The God Ningizzida: Iraq I, 1934, pp. 71 - 6, pls.

Douglas Van Buren assign the seal to the period to which it belongs, for they recall the Blau monuments and other works of the Jemdet Nasr Period, and even more closely certain cylinder seals which, upon good grounds, have been attributed to the preceding period, Uruk IV18. The paddle-shaped object held by the kneeling man is depicted on cylinder seals of that period, but always in connexion with cult scenes19, and the serpents themselves belong in a sense to the category of heraldic beasts with entwined necks or tails which are characteristic of Uruk IV20. It is difficult to determine the precise significance of the serpents in these scenes, but it is quite possible that the rite which is being performed was part of a New Year Festival or other fertility ceremony in which the presence of the serpents would be singularly appropriate. A fine cylinder seal, Iraq Museum 10759, appears to belong to the same period (Fig. 2). It is of pale grey stone and measures 35 X 18 mm. Two plendid ibexes face each other, oblivious of the eagle which rises above them with out-spread wings, and clutches their backs with its talons. Two big serpents rear their coils which cross and recross between the ibexes, and directly above there is an eight-petalled rosette. Wild goats of this species are represented with equal realism on several seals of this period, especially the magnificent seal VA 10537 where the simple, outlined rosette is also depicted21, or VA 3902 which shows a procession of ibexes with an eagle hovering above them22. Rosettes with contours traced by tiny ridges are typical of this age, and are essentially different from the rosettes of the Early Dynastic Period when each petal was represented as a unified surface, usually of a colour or texture contrasting with its background. Another cylinder seal of grey stone, 25 X 13 mm., may be dated somewhat later, for the animals are rendered more conventionally. The scheme of decoration is that of pairs of animals heraldically confronted (Fig. 3)2S. Here the animals are a lion and a stag, but they are kept apart by the vertical column of entwined serpents. The composition clearly had an astral significance, although its exact meaning is now obscure, for in the field above the backs of animals the crescent moon is pictured, and around it are the star-like disk of the sun and seven dots to indicate the Pleiades. During the excavations at Khafajah, two fragments of a green steatite vase were discovered24. The vessel was carved in relief with two serpents entwined, their bodies picked out with hollows to indicate scales which were then filled in with red and yellow paste; the effect thus produced was very striking. A cylinder seal of semi-translucent marble, 23 X 19 mm., shows a curious scene enacted by figures rendered by the simplest conventions possible25.

Beyond on the right there is a man who turns toward the bull which approaches from the right. The heads of an ibex and a gazelle lie on the ground on each side of the man. Another man leans across in front of the bull's body, and grasps the neck of the second of the two entwined serpents which rear on the left of the kneeling figure who, indeed, holds the other serpent by the neck. Thus the chain is complete. At Kish two cylinder seals were discovered, both engraved with the same lively scene (Fig. 4) 26. One is of shell and measures 23 X 7 mm., the other is of limestone, and they are to be attributed to the earlier part of the Early Dynastic Period. A man, with a "bird" head and a skirt with tasselled border, holds a bow in one hand and attempts with the other hand to plunge a dagger into the neck of a lion which rears up to bite the back of a stag; but the man's task is a hard one because the beast has a magnificent, bristling mane which covers its neck and shoulders. The limits of the picture are defined by entwined serpents placed vertically, and above them are the sun, moon and planet-star. A cylinder seal of pink marble, measuring 28 X 18 mm., displays a badly worn subject which is very typical of the Pre-Sargonid Period27. A nude man with a "bird" head clasps the necks of two bulls which are attacked by lions. The scene is closed by entwined serpents rearing vertically. The lapis lazuli cylinder seal, Morgan Collection No. 35, measures 24 X 10 mm. (Fig. 5)28. Engraved on it is a religious scene as conceived in the Pre-Sargonid Period. A god, already crowned with the horns which were later the invariable mark of a divinity, sits before the door of his temple and sucks liquid through a long, thin pipe from a big jar standing on the ground. A man with wild locks of hair stabs a rearing lion which attacks a reversed and now almost effaced animal. The crescent and the dots of the Pleiades are shown in the background, while across the top of the scene two entwined serpents, head to tail, stretch their length. Professor Frankfort claims that the god seated before the shrine is Ningizzida, and that he is also symbolized by the entwined serpents. This seal would therefore be an example of a god represented in a single scene by his anthropomorphic and his theriomorphic image. In PQ/1216, a grave belonging to the later part of the Royal Cemetery at Ur, a lapis lazuli cylinder seal was brought to light29. It measures 31 X 8 mm., and the rather carelessly cut design has been almost obliterated by deterioration. Scorpions in a row are represented in the upper register ; the lower one is filled with two entwined serpents whose coils criss-cross horizontally round the cylinder. The design on VA 554 is composed of the same elements, but the emphasis is in the contrary sense, for here the scorpions placed one behind the other in the single register are very big, and the column of the entwined serpents is secondary30. 26) K 2185 = Iraq Mus., K 1117 = Field Mus.; Langdon, Excav. at Kish I, pp. 80 f., 84, pls.

Douglas Van Buren A red stratum consisting of crumbled bricks, potsherds and jar-sealings appears to have spread uniformly over nearly the whole of the Royal Cemetery area at Ur81. The tablets found in this stratum bear a semi-pictographic script, and help to date the level, for the character of the script indicates that they must be placed between the tablets from Fara and those from Jemdet Nasr. The jar-sealings bear the impressions of seals, and traced on one of them are what look like geometric lines88, but are in reality new forms of the interlaced serpents motive, for the coils are threaded in and out to produce a complicated twist or latticework, spreading until it covers an approx- imately square area. Similar designs were stamped on clay sealings at Susa, but as they are fragmentary the patterns are incomplete8*. A broken cylinder seal of dark green stone, still retaining part of a fourfold twist, was discovered at Fara34; it is a specimen of the seals used to stamp the jar-sealings, and there is a tiny oval bit of clay from the same site, apparently a sealing, which depicts the lower part of the motive of serpents entwined in a vertical position85. It is probable that the serpent, as an emblem of wealth and fertility, was considered an appropriate and lucky device with which to seal supplies ; the two snakes entwined, symbolizing the male and female principle, formed a motive of the happiest augury for increased and continued prosperity. The scheme is seen to better advantage on some of the broken clay tablets found in the ruins of houses at Fara. The drawings on them were traced in the soft clay with a very pointed implement, and an effect of light and shade was produced by thicker or thinner lines, made by pressing more or less heavily with the tool. The exact purpose of these tablets is not known; it is possible that the designs were trial sketches made by the artist, for on one tablet no fewer than five versions of the serpent twist are drawn, each one more complicated than the preceding one8*; other fragmen- tary tablets show parts of similar motives87. The design is delineated in its full beauty and complexity in a seal impression repeated two or three times on a big lump of clay (Fig. 6) 88. The coils are traced with masterly precision, and curve and flow with such sinuous grace that the eye becomes confused in fallowing the maze. On the left the serpent's head protrudes, and in its mouth it holds by the tail a froglike animal resembling a newt or other small aquatic creature. An almost identical design, but carved with much less precision and beauty of line, can be seen on a cylinder seal, Iraq Mus. 6980, of pale grey stone, broken at the upper edge and measuring 25 X 15 mm. (Fig. 7). This time the pattern does not flow uninterruptedly, but seems to "break" at least twice. The dangling creature may be a tortoise.

It is so badly worn that the left side of the twisted coils and the pendent creature are almost obliterated. Another grey marble cylinder seal, 30 X 15 mm., Iraq Museum 13916, represents the curious subject of a divinity seated in a boat which has a human head and trunk and the tail of a scorpion. Behind it the twisted serpents motive spreads squarely in the space left between the repetition of the figures (Fig. 8). The latest explanation of the boat with a human prow is that of Professor Frankfort who thinks that the subject depicts the sun-god passing during the night over the waters of the underworld, and he seeks to connect it with a whole cycle of fertility myths40. The North-Western American Indians, to whom allusion has already been made, believe that the serpent is a god of the sea and of the underworld who sometimes rises out of the water in the shape of a canoe, and brings power and fortune to all who see him. Another seal, badly worn, which illustrates the same myth, shows two serpents entwined horizontally across the top of the scene41. If a similar belief was held in Mesopotamia this seal would illustrate two aspects of the serpent, firstly that of a divine being who lived in the waters of the underworld, and secondly that of a symbol of fertility. A neater example of the twist is seen on a limestone cylinder seal in a private collection48. It seems to consist of one big serpent only, with its head in the left upper part of the pattern. There is a scorpion above the twist, and on the left a man touches the serpent's coils with one hand and with the other caresses a rearing ibex. A long snake slithers down and thrusts its head almost under the creature's feet. Although it was bought at Aleppo a cylinder seal of pink marble, 29 X 15 mm., seems stylistically to belong here48. A man, with "bird" head, big eye and pointed locks of hair like those of the human prow depicted in Fig. 8, is posed in a curious attitude which has been described as that of a dancer. He raises both hands as if in reverence before the intricate coils of a serpent whose head and tail can just be distinguished on the right, projecting from the latticework in such a way that they almost touch the man's arm and knee. There are a scorpion and a star behind him. A limestone cylinder seal was purchased at Hillah, but as nothing so archaic has been discovered at Babylon the object was probably found at some other site44. Two serpents are woven into a simple twist; their tails protrude at the top, their heads on the left. A man, with a "bird" head and a skirt with tasselled border, approaches the serpents; he holds aloft a little bowl, as if he were offering a libation. The marble cylinder seal, Iraq Museum 14334, is very big, for it measures 63X23 mm. (Fig. 9). There are two registers separated by an ornamental band, and other bands, differently decorated, run round the cylinder at the top and bottom. The upper register is filled with a complicated pattern of interlaced serpent coils and with two gigantic scorpions, one vertically, the other horizontally placed.

Douglas Van Buren contains a scene of two seated figures who hold cups, while one attendant stands between them and two more confront each other, one on each side of a conventional tree. Scenes of this type, showing figures with "bird" heads, hair neatly tied up in a chignon at the back of the head, sticklike arms and long skirts, are common in the Early Dynastic Period. There were four chambers in PG/779, the grave in the Royal Cemetery at Ur in which the mosaic "standard" was discovered. In the fallen stonework of the vault of Chamber A two cylinder seals were found, the smaller one stuck into a hole in the larger one which was badly worn. The smaller cylinder measures 17X8 mm., and is of lapis lazuli (Fig. 10)45. The design consists of a bearded bull turned to right and rearing up so that its forelegs touch the coils of a serpent which makes a latticework covering the whole height of the field. The reptile's head is below the bull's forelegs, its tail projects close to the animal's head. The excavators point out that these seals were found above the chamber, and must therefore be considered later than the contents of the grave itself. Excavations at Uruk revealed a cylinder seal which presents a problem hard to decipher on account of the effaced condition of the carving46. A bull walks to right, and above its back one can distinguish a big scorpion. The bull is flanked by great serpent twists of a comparatively simple type, but spreading over the field from top to bottom. All these elements are such as are constantly found in early glyptic art down to, and including, the Early Dynastic Period, but the seal was discovered with three others in Room 31 of the Anu-Antum temple. As the room contained a base for a cult statue and a small altar, and must have served as a chapel, one can only suppose that these seals, which are all four without exception of an early date, were preserved as relics of antiquity, meet offerings for a temple treasury. One of the finest examples of the serpent twist is that traced on a bitumen relief from Susa47. Two nude men with long hair hanging down their backs stand opposite each other, and both extend one hand. In the space between them a small fawn or kid walks to right, while up above two serpents with big heads cross and recross in an elegant knot, and complete the pattern by swallowing their own tails. The bitumen reliefs from Susa have been thought to be works of the Early Dynastic Period, or even of the period of Jemdet Nasr. The masterly draughtsmanship testifies to the artist's skill and sense of rhythm, and the suavity of line displayed by the interlaced serpents motive produces an effect of an endless gliding round and round, in and out in an uninterrupted viscous flow.

In his right hand he holds a panther, in his left hand a lion. Directly above his head the serpents weave their coils; they are enormous in comparison with the size of the hero. Their heads do not confront each other as they do on the bitumen relief, but one is at the top, the other at the lower part of the twist. The style of the drawing, the frontal figure of the nude hero, the way in which he balances the beasts with absolute symmetry, the introduction of the panther into the composition, all indicate that this seal may be dated towards the end of the Early Dynastic Period. A big shell cylinder seal, 45 X 27 mm., was found in PQ/261, and is therefore "dated by external evidence to the earlier part of the Royal Cemetery Period"49, although criteria of style and the motives represented would otherwise have inclined one to assign it to a later period. It is inscribed in a purely linear script dgig-bu-lugal. The main composition depicts two lions attacking a reversed goat: the scheme is not perfectly symmetrical, for a panther is illogically introduced, and crosses the lion on the left. The remainder of the field is divided into two registers. Below the inscription in the upper register there are two bulls crossed. In the lower register a "Wild Man" holds up two reversed lions by the hind legs; the space between the lion on the right and the main composition is filled by an intricate example of the serpent twist, the serpent's head projecting close to the lion's foreleg. The entwined serpents motive" was more rarely employed in the time of Agade, but cylinder seals discovered at Tell Asmar sometimes provide examples of its use. The first illustrates the well-known scheme of a divinity triumphing over the foe whom he has beaten to his knees (Fig. II)50. An immense serpent twist occupies more than half the remainder of the field; the serpent's head almost touches the god's shoulder, and its tail extends beyond the coils on the same side. The relation of the serpent twist to the main subject is not immediately obvious unless we understand the full implication of the contest between the gods. Professor Frankfort believes that here the victorious god is Ningizzida, and that the serpent twist is his symbol. However that may be, if the scene portrayed the victory of a fertility deity over a divine being who was inimical to the growth of vegetation, then the introduction of the serpent motive was apposite, for it symbolized the furtherance of the benefits gained by the conqueror. A second seal illustrates the scheme of a worshipper introduced by his patron god into the presence of a higher divinity (Fig. 12)51. The man brings a goat as a sacrifice. The bearded deity holds out a tall tumbler, and two serpents, coiled at his feet, thrust forth their heads. Behind his seat there is a big dagger or sacrificial knife, and a divine attendant holds a curious staff with a threefold head just like the one carried by the patron god. A serpent twist with precisely drawn coils is traced in the lower part of the remaining space, and here its presence can be more readily under- stood, for the chief god is an ophidian deity (Ningizzida, according to Professor Frankfort), who, consequently, must have had powers as a god of fertility. Another cylinder seal from Tell Asmar also shows a scene of presentation to a god who is 4a) U 8513 = CBS 16869; Legrain, MJ XX, 1929, p. 272, pl.

Douglas Van B,uren without the serpents by his side, but immediately behind his seat two serpents entwined rear up in a vertical column52. They are upright on a seal from the same site on which the only other figures represented are the "twin" gate-keepers53, but the serpent twist is relegated to the lower register on a badly rubbed shell cylinder seal, BM. 121155. A marble seal, 31 X 17 mm., returns to the subject of animal contests, for it shows a lion attacking one of a pair of goats which rear upon either side of a bush or clump of reeds which is divided into two parts diverging symmetrically, a motive found only in the Akkadian Period. The final element is the motive of the serpents entwined vertically. On a basalt cylinder seal, 25 X 16 mm., a nude hero contends with a bull, and a second with a lion; below the inscription are entwined serpents54. The Collection de Clercq possesses a strange seal of green porphyry decorated with a multitude of details introduced with a definite purpose, although apparently at random55. In the lower part of the field two gazelles are lying, and two kids leap up toward them. The spaces left by the curve of the gazelles' horns are filled alternately by a scorpion and an eight-petalled rosette. Above them is a bull's head, and still higher are the heads of two ibexes flanked by heads of gazelles. A bird, a tortoise, a four-petalled flower, a goat's head serve as "filling" motives, and the entwined serpents curve like a chain through the midst of the design. This composition reveals many elements drawn from the art of the mountain peoples from the north and west. The desire to picture as much as possible, and to leave no space unfilled overrides all sense of proportion and detracts from the harmony of the composition. The motive of the entwined serpents must have been in use over the greater part of the Near East. A jar-sealing from Kiil-tepe was purchased many years ago from a dealer in Constantinople by Herrn Siegfried Löschcke for the Archäologischen Apparat of the Berlin University56. The impression was stamped with a seal of the archaic round type, and was decorated with a border formed of two serpents entwined; the two tails are plainly visible sticking out side by side as far as the very edge of the seal, and the head of one serpent can also be seen. In the middle are a fish, and two asses pairing. Thus the representation of the middle of the seal and the border around the design both prove that even at that time and in that region the ancient motive still retained all its value as a fertility symbol, although it had apparently been degraded to a mere decorative ornament. The way in which the motive is here employed suggests that braid pattern, when used as an ornament on the Cappadocian or the so-called "Syro-Hittite" seals, may have derived ultimately from the entwined serpents motive. The most celebrated of all the representations of the entwined serpents is that on the vase of dark green steatite dedicated by Qudea to his god Ningizzida57.

In the space between them the fish-bone ridge which runs down from the lip of the vase simulates a post around which two serpents appear to be entwined, their coils crossing and recrossing one another, their heads reaching just to the lip of the vessel, so that they seem to sip the liquid which overflows from the libation offering. Qudea was not the first to decorate a vase with the motive of entwined serpents; but the vase from Khafajah, the precursor of Gudea's offering, rendered the symbol in its simplest form. In Qudea's time the sanctity of the symbol was fully realized, and it had acquired an additional mystical meaning. The "lion-birds" act as divine attendants who are wardens of the gate; they open the doors of the sanctuary to disclose the mystery within, the entwined serpents embodying the male and female principle, portending the blessings of procreation, of fertility for man and beast. The representation on this vase may be thought a very strong argument for accepting Professor Frankfort's theory that the motive symbolized Ningizzida, and he writes : "there is no doubt that the entwined serpents represent here the god ... the god himself is only indicated by the caduceus" 5íi. The vase was dedicated to Ningizzida who was the patron god of Qudea, and the wardens of the gate were the god's own particular creatures. But I still find it difficult to believe that such an ancient symbol, of such immense significance, could have been relegated to the position of an image of Ningizzida, a minor deity whose importance waxed and waned with the lifetime of Qudea. Is it not more probable that by the time of Qudea the motive of the entwined serpents was not the symbol of any particular god, but of the mystery of the ieçòç yáfioç, and therefore was an augury of the blessings which derived from that sacred act? The god who was the protagonist in the ceremony might be Ningizzida in one city, Ningirsu in another, but the symbol remained unalterable. Its original significance was changed in as far as the motive was no longer applicable to marriage between human beings; it had become too sacred a symbol for common use, for it represented allegorically the quintessence of all marriage, the sacred union between the god and goddess. The only instance of which I am aware of the genuine motive of twisted serpents on an object belonging to a period after Qudea can be seen on a serpentine amulet from Nippur, 32 X 31 mm., shaped like a miniature Lamaštu relief89. On the reverse a scorpion is engraved. On the obverse there is a dog walking to right up an inclined ground-line. Above it is a sacrificial knife, below its head a rhombos. The space below the ground-line is filled by two serpents entwined. Thus every object drawn on the stone had a magical significance which protected the owner of the amulet from evil and ensured to him an increase of good. The motive then disappears from view and re-emerges, after many centuries, transformed into the symbol of the god of healing, Asklepios.
