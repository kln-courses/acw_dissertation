<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION dicated by this procedure. One looks in vain for tangible and objectively applied literary criteria. There are vague passing references to Paul's "style" and grammar and to such con- ventionalized literary forms as the thanksgiv- ings, but the reader never observes a thorough application of any such criteria; such use as is made is only in support of the view determined by logical consideration. The inexactness of this procedure is indicated by the several compari- sons of alleged accretions with Hebrews and the Pastorals. Here, again, the reviewer has no doubt that Hawkins is acquainted with the work of Blass, Bultmann, and Harrison. How- ever, it was incumbent upon Hawkins, in sum- marily disregarding it, to prove, rather than merely to assert, his contrary position. An astonishing feature of this monograph is the author's characterization of the alleged spurious passages. They are said to be "per- verted" (pp. 276, 277), "puerile" (242), "bun- glesome" (238, 281), "not particularly intelli- gent" (248), "in utter, hopeless confusion" (55, II9), "palpable absurdity" (37), "a degeneracy of sub-Pauline thought" (io6), "sheer stupid- ity" (256), and "revolting doctrine" (I29). All that this means, of course, is that Hawkins does not like what is attributed to Paul in the pas- sages concerned. That Christianity in history found these passages effective suggests that a historical approach in seeking the historical Paul is of greater value than a professor's prejudices. The general sense of this monograph's failure to accomplish what is implied by its title is in- tensified, finally, by the failure to generalize the supposed findings. After the introductory chap- ter the book proceeds by chapters on the several letters, with the attempted distinction of the genuine from the spurious parts. Once the dis- tinction is made, in a curious sequence of the letters, the book stops. Possibly it is intended that the reader will then note the table of spuri- ous passages, dismiss them, and that with no further assistance he has "recovered" the his- torical Paul. It appears to the reviewer that he must continue to search. It reflects no credit upon the book's pub- lisher that so superb an example of format, material, and printing is issued without either a subject or a text index. DONALD W. RIDDLE U.S. Army Air Force The Anti-anthropomorphisms of the Greek Penta- teuch. By CHARLES T. FRITSCH. Princeton: Princeton University Press, I943. v+8I pages. $2.00. The Hebrew conception of God was different from the Greek; it was very anthropomorphic. How did the translators deal with the instances where God spoke, felt, and acted like a man? In dealing with their attitude, Dr. Fritsch in a careful, well-organized, clearly arranged essay shows that "in the great majority of cases .... the anthropomorphisms and anthropopathies [are] carried over into the Greek without any change" (p. 20), although "some anthropomor- phic expressions and metaphors are quite con- sistently avoided in the Greek" (p. 62.) "Quite" must be stressed, because the translators are not altogether consistent even in these cases. In the investigation of other evidences of this tendency, the author has not always kept in mind his own words: "The translators were governed not only by the desire to produce a faithful rendering of the original, but also to produce a version which reflected their knowl- edge of the Greek idiom and style as far as that was possible" (p. i6). For he adduces many cases where without any anti-anthropomorphic tendency the translators tried either to make clearer or to soften some expressions in accord- ance with their own understanding and the Greek way of expressing it. The limitation of the study to the Penta- teuch gives it too narrow a scope. The incidental reference to Frankel's suggestion that "the anti-anthropomorphic tendency is stronger in the Pentateuch than in the later books of the Greek Old Testament" (p. 25) is not enough. Neither is the mere statement enough that there are two opposing positions regarding the origin of the anti-anthropomorphic tendency and that there are "two streams of anti-anthropomor- phic development in Jewish history": the one in the Hebrew Old Testament as a result of the theological development of the Jews themselves, and the other in the LXX as due to the influence of Greek speculation and philosophy. Dr. Fritsch has not proved to my mind that this tendency in the LXX is not due to the inner Jewish development. Neither his arguments from the translation of ?'Tr by 6 Cv nor from the different psychological attitude of the trans- lators are cogent. Whether God thinks in his "heart" or in his "mind" is immaterial from the point of anthropomorphism. To see in the five Greek translations of 6 cv "the introduction of a I38</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS philosophic coloring entirely foreign to the He- brew mind" appears to me to be an overstate- ment. "The difference," he continues "consists simply in that the Hebrew conceives of God in a more personal way than the Greek." But who is conscious of this when he reads the Greek Pen- tateuch? Even in reading B6 v in (Exod., chap. 3), is one really in the presence of a philosophi- cally conceived God? If the Jewish reader thought of the matter at all, it was most prob- ably of the mysterious name whose very pro- nunciation was dangerous and to be avoided. Did not the LXX translation of Lev. 24:II, I5- i6 accentuate this? Of course, it would be differ- ent if the translators had consistently used o &amp;cv for Yahweh throughout, as, for instance, the French Bible does with L'Eternel. But they fol- lowed the true Semitic instinct by taking KVpLOS, for the lordship of God was character- istic of the Semitic conception. After all, whether one agrees with Dr. Fritsch's conclusions or not, the collection of the material and the clear and attractive man- ner in which it is presented as well as printed make his essay both profitable and pleasant reading to the interested student. JULIUS A. BEWER Union Theological Seminary Hebrew Union College Annual, Vol. XVII. Edited by D. PHILIPSON, S. H. BLANK, J. MORGENSTERN, and A. CRONBACH. Cincin- nati: Hebrew Union College, I942-43. 584 pages. $3.00. Biblical scholars will be most attracted to the three longest articles in this Annual, comprising I53, II4, and 102 pages, respectively. Two of these are little books, replete with table of con- tents and indexes. Julius and Hildegard Lewy collaborate to produce a significant calendar study, "The Origin of the Week'and the Oldest West Asiatic Calendar." Through the cuneiform sources, they would trace the seven-day week and a pentecontad calendar back into the third millennium B.C. Their data for a seven-day week in early Mesopotamia do not appear at all conclusive, and we may question whether the seven-day week was integral to the pente- contad calendar. More convincing is their pres- entation of the Amorite, West Semitic pente- contad calendar, in which the year was com- posed of seven periods of fifty days, plus an in- tercalary period of fifteen (or sixteen) days. It is first evidenced in the Old Assyrian texts from Kiiltepe. Its presence in Palestine is plausibly argued. From the calendar data in the P source in the flood story in Genesis, chapters 7 and 8, it appears that the Palestinian sapattum, the inter- calary period, was divided into two separate periods: a seven-day period before the first pentecontad and an eight-day period before the fifth pentecontad. The first corresponds to the feast of unleavened cakes, and the second to the feast of booths. The authors are probably correct in assuming that the dates in the flood story motivate, by an allegedly historical tradi- tion, the celebration of agricultural festivals. Their reconstruction of Ezra's calendar reforms is doubtful, for the supposed changes are as early as the Holiness Code and Ezekiel, chapter 45. II Chron. 35: is no evidence that Josiah's passover came on the fourteenth of the first month, for the Chronicler here, as usual, re- flects contemporary practices. The authors have presented the most important recent study of the Hebrew calendar. President Morgenstern's article, "The Ark, the Ephod, and the 'Tent of Meeting,' " con- tinues his ealier studies and is most valuable for its collection and analysis of the descriptions of analogous Arabic institutions, utfa, markab, mahmal, and qubba, from many different sources. One must be cautious, however, in using the relatively late Arabic data in reconstructing Hebrew institutions of the first and second millenniums B.C. In one of his many interesting footnotes, he holds the Hebrew kohen to have been identical in character and function with the Arab kahin, as soothsayer or diviner rather than priest. We possess, however, early Canaanite sources which imply the contrary, and we may refer to two fourteenth-fifteenth century B.C. adzes from Ugarit, inscribed with the words rb khnm, "chief of the priests." Albright's view that Arabic kahin may be a loan-word from the north, and the Arabic institution a later spe- cialization in function, is historically more prob- able. The reviewer cannot follow Morgenster's hypothesis that the ark was analogous in form to the qubba. The latter was a tent, and its his- torical antecedent the biblical tabernacle; the former was, in form, a minature temple. The reviewer doubts any association of the camel with either the ark or the tabernacle of the Old Testament. It is not clear that domesticated camels were in use at the time of the Exodus or conquest of Canaan, and no camel is mentioned in the story of the wilderess of wandering. I39</page></plain_text>
