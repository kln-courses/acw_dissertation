<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY AND FINE ARTS Agnes Spycket, Les statues de culte dans les textes mesopotamiens, des origines a la Ire dynastie de Babylone (Cahiers de la Revue Biblique, no. 9, 1968, 1 vol. in-8?, 118 pp., 5 pis., 14 line drawings). In a meticulous and well documented study the author introduces a problem which so far has been entirely neglected. She queries the actual existence of cult statues in ancient Meso? potamia and proposes to investigate the way in which the Mesopotamian gods used to manifest themselves to the devotees, challenging the generally accepted view that anthropomorphic representations of deities or divine beings stood in the cellae of the temples for all the devotees to be seen and to be worshipped. This study which encompasses the 3rd and early 2nd millennia only, to the close of the 1st Dynasty of Babylon, hinges, for the greater part, on religious and economic texts. However, a long introduction provides the reader with a detailed account of all the archaeological facts relevant to the subject. A brief discussion of the architectural discre? pancy between the "bent axis approach" of the sanctuaries of the 3rd millennium down to Neo-Sumerian times and the "straight axis ap? proach" coming into fashion towards the close of the 3rd millennium (although both architec? tural lay-outs were furnished with a podium against the back wall of the cellae) leads to an examination of the archaeological material at hand in order to establish the existence of an? thropomorphic representantions with a definite divine character, destined by their measurements to match the dimensions of the sanctuaries and the sizes of the podia, and which, therefore, could have acted as proper cult statues. In spite of the general view that statues of deities once stood on the podia in the cellae of the temples, Miss Spycket stresses correctly that it is hard to explain why not one cult statue has been found in situ to date. Of all the previously accepted evidence in favour of the existence of cult statues in pre Akkadian times, not one example appears valid for this issue. H. Frankfort singled out two sculptures from a hoard of 12 statues discovered in the Square Temple of Abu at Tell Asmar (Early Dynastic II), which he believed to repre? sent the god and his consort on account of their sizes, the representations on their bases and the measurements of their eyes. Miss Spycket points out that there is no reason for regarding these two statues as being of a divine nature. She suggests that they could equally well repre? sent worshippers like the other statues of this same hoard. The same applies to fragments of other, presumably large scale, sculpture: from Uruk III, the Square Temple of Abu at Tell Asmar, the Sin Temple IV at Khaf?jah, the Shara Temple at Tell Agrab, the Eye Temple at Tell Brak and the Ninhursag Temple IV at Mari, all dating to the Jamdat Nasr and Early Dynastic periods. There is no way of learning about their true nature and their supposed divine character is therefore suspect. On the other hand, an 8,4 cm. high female head and a female figurine made of silver, both from Mari, can most likely be treated as deities on account of two distinct divine characteristics (polos and pairs of horns). However, their small size seems to militate against their pos? sible cult purpose. The first indisputable cult statue dates from the Akkadian period. The author has discov? ered that a badly damaged 25 cm. high woman's head from Susa wearing a triple pair of horns [postlude, p. 106) belongs to a now headless statue of an 85 cm. measuring seated female clad in the traditional kaunakes, also discovered at Susa. This fortunate discovery has restored to this statue its divine character and its true function as a cult statue. This statue, which is dedicated by Puzur-Inshushinak and which already in the past has often been considered to represent the goddess Innana, represents the only example in Elam and Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium B.C. (see below). Among the various sculptured representations of gods and divine beings in Neo-Sumerian times not one is relevant to Miss Spyckers present study. All existing examples are merely statu? ettes and therefore cannot be regarded as being fit to serve a cult function. Tello has provided an interesting statue of Alia, sukkal of Ningizzida, but it is difficult to visualize this effigy of a secondary god as a cult statue. Moreover, its measurements have not been stated. Anyhow, a small scale would ex? clude this sculpture from a possible cult pur? pose. The early centuries of the 2nd millennium B.C. have procured several statuettes of a divine nature coming from Susa and Ischali, but they are all ? des "modeles reduits" ?. However, two large-scale sculptures from Mari suggest that at this time the existence of cult statues has been 331</page><page sequence="2">established. One is the 1,42 m. measuring ? deesse au vase jaillisant?, whose true identity is still a matter of discussion. The second ex? ample of a supposed cult statue, also from Mari, and probably measuring 1,09 m., is the ?Ca bane? statue, dedicated by Iasmah-Addu, king of Mari and possibly to be identified, according to the author, with the god Shamash. Before launching a careful examination cf those cuneiform texts which are pertinent to her search for the existence of cult statues in ancient Mesopotamia, the author has rounded off this archaeological section by discussing briefly the reliefs and cylinder representations which demonstrate indisputably that already from the early start of the 3rd millennium the Mesopotamian deities were venerated in anthro? pomorphic form. Yet, in all depicted cult scenes ? with the libation act as the most favourite theme, particularly in pre-Akkadian times ?, it is impossible to decide whether the human figures, wearing a horn-crown or nothing, and being worshipped or otherwise, because of their larger scale, being the obvious centre of venera? tion, represent proper statues, or represent human beings taking their part, or simply must be regar? ded as a divine concept. A seal impression of Naram-Sin, showing a seated vegetation/fertility goddess with behind her a small-scale replica of the same deity stand? ing on a socle, underlines the author's indecision. At the start of the 2nd millennium B.C. small terracottas copy the seal representations and show a deity inside a miniature sanctuary or a chapel. We like to stress the probability that some (if not all [?]) deities could be substituted by their animal attribute; compare e.g. the decorated mace-head of Barag-ki-ba (pre-Akkadian period) where the god Ningirsu has been substituted by his animal attribute the lion-headed eagle, or the famous vase dedicated by Gudea of L^gash to his protecting deity Ningizzida where the latter in the guise of his animal attribute, the dragon, guards the holy sanctuary of Ea who himself has been substituted by two copulating snakes. Or even by their emblem which ap? parently symbolized the:r most essential aspect; compare a Jamdat Nasr cylinder seal from Abu Hatab (Moortgat, 1940, pi. 16, no. 33) where cult objects (?) are carried around during a certain ceremony. One may even consider the author's suggestion of a possible substitution by a priest (or the king), who played the role of the god at certain ceremonial occasions (com? pare the hieros gamos performed by the king and a priestess) (see below). Miss Spycket opens her textual investiga? tion with the pre-Akkadian period where two signs ALAN and D?L stand for the Akkadian word for statue saltnu. She argues that in predynastic times the words ALAN and D?L relate not to statues of deities, but merely to statues representing human beings, members of the royal family like e g. Ur-Nanshe, Lugalanda and his wife Barnamtara, the wife of Urukagina, of Lagash and Lamgi Mari of Mari and high officials, which received offerings of various kinds. Indeed, several of such royal statues bearing a dedicative inscrip? tion have been found, e.g. of Entemena of La gash, Itur-Shamash and Ebih-il of Mari and a sang?-pritst of Khaf?jah. The core of the author's argument lies in the fact that the cuneiform texts specifically use the word ALAN or D?L when referring to sta? tues of devotees, but always omit the word sta? tue wThen there is mention of divine beings; we do not find ALAN/D?L d X. Miss Spycket re? futes the generally accepted view that texts, re? ferring to deities, frequently use the phrase X d Ymu-tud ? the verb t u d standing for "to create', rto make a statue5 ? which would confirm the supposed existence of divine statues. On the contrary, she proposes to explain the implied word ALAN as the proper statue of the king or ensi, dedicated to these deities and stand? ing in their temples. The validity of Miss Spycket's argument seems to be emphasized by the peg-statue of Lugalkisalsi, king of Uruk, which, although de? dicated to the goddess Nammu and bearing an inscription ending with dn a m m u mu-du, cannot represent the goddess Nammu herself, and must therefore be regarded as Lugalkisalsi who ? for Nammu has made [this statue] ?. The Akkadian period has known many royal steles and statues, the latter now mostly desi? gnated by the word D?L. A cuneiform tablet from the Enlil temple at Nippur, the Ekur (CBS 13972), mentioning the inscriptions present on socles or statues of the various kings of the dynasty of Akkad and donated to Enlil, relates only to statues of kings (stone as well as tin and gold) or to royal steles, e.g. of Sargon, Rimush and Manishtusu. From this tablet we learn that there were more than one statue of the same king in one temple. Later tablets of the Larsa period also relate to statues and inscriptions of the Akkadian kings. The same holds true for Puzur-Inshushinak of Susa, who dedicated to his god Tnshushinak several statuettes and a stele. The relief of Annubanini, king of the Lulubi, 332</page><page sequence="3">refers in its inscription to the representation of the goddess Ishtar as sa-latn illstar, written pho? netically. Although in this case salam cannot be translated with statue, since we are dealing here with a low relief, we have learnt through the statue of the goddess Innana (or the Elamite Naru(n)te [?]), dedicated by Puzur-Inshushinak (see above), that already at the close of the Akkadian period the concept of a cult statue was engendered. Yet, from the ensuing time of Gudea of Lagash we have only statues of the ruling family (designated by the word ALAN), which have now a well-defined function as is explicitly ex? plained by the inscriptions; they must act in the temples as "porte-priere" on behalf of those who dedicated them, standing before their gods in long-lasting prayer and neverceasing devotion. These statues are said to have received regular offerings, but Miss Spycket wonders whether these offerings might have been meant for the god to whom the princely statues were dedicated. Not one cult statue has been discovered (see above) and not a single text gives the slightest hint that they did indeed exist. The author correctly expresses her amazement over the fact that Gudea, who has given such accurate and detailed accounts of his various pious activities and whose statues have survived up to the present day, does not once mention the manu? facture or the installation of a divine statue, although Cylinder B enumerates the names of 20 divine beings. In which form venerated the house of Gudea its deities? Human sub? stitutes or perhaps symbols? The total absence of any divine statue only provides negative evidence. The kings of the Ur III dynasty, who were deified in their lifetime, had their statues made during their life, as we learn from the existent royal statues, and also through an abundance cf economic texts. The latter are particularly in? structive as regards the various ritual offerings which the statues of the deified kings ? either still alive or already defunct ? as well as the gods received, the temples and places which housed these royal statues, and the existence of libation places, apparently always close by the statue of a king. Textual evidence also indicates that the deified kings of Ur had their own sanc? tuaries, two of which, at Eshnunna and Adab, have been discovered. Furthermore, the cunei? form tablets refer to the fact that at certain festivals royal statues (e.g. of Shulgi and Shu-Sin) as well as deities were carried around in proces? sion. How can we interpret this latter piece of information? What was the aspect of these deities and which means of transport was used? Why does not the word '^3^'' accompany the names of the gods mentioned in the texts, texts which do use the word alan in connection with the representations of the deified kings. During Shulgi's reign there seems to appear the expression alan 1 u g a 1, which, accord? ing to Miss Spycket, refers to the statue of the ruling king. Although the word for statue never occurs, the author has nevertheless found two indications in favour of the existence of divine statues in the Ur III period; during the reign of Shulgi there are references to the installation of deities in their temples, but we have no idea of their appearance. The Ur III tablets refer to divine statues dressed in gold and silver sheathing, but the small quantities of metal, which have been mentioned as having been used for this purpose, indicate that these statues can only have been of a modest scale; perhaps they are merely statuet? tes. Admittedly there is, in the Ur III texts, question of representations of divine beings, but not of cult statues. The first written references to the existence of divine statues by means of the explicit phrase alan d X, principally in the year-names, are found in Isin-Larsa times. But were these divine figures also cult statues? The 6th year of Idin Dagan of Isin was named after a large statue cf Nin-isin: ? year in which he made a large copper statue of Nin-isin ? (.... alan gu-la dni ni? si - i n - n a ...). A year-name of Enlil-bani of Isin mentions a gold statue of Ninurta (.... alan guskin dnin-urta ....). Besides, the earlier custom of the time of Gudea of Lagash and the Ur III dynasty of installing royal statues in the temples is also encountered in the early centuries of the 2nd millennium B.C. The fact that Sin-idinnam of Larsa on the one hand mentions in detail the rich temple furniture with which he provided the gods of the Ebabbar at Larsa but on the other hand does not give any reference to cult statues, makes Miss Spycket wonder who were supposed to sit on these lavishly adorned thrones mentioned by him: seated statues of deities, or human substitutes in the person of the k:ng or a priest? Finally, Kudurmabuk of Larsa seems to al? lude to the manufacture of a statue of Nanna and mentions a statue of Ninhursag ? aux mem bres splendides ?. Can we infer from this information and from a Sumerian vocabulary from Nippur, which dif 333</page><page sequence="4">ferentiates, in its enumeration of various objects and emblems of metal or any other material, between ? an Ishtar? of bronze, and silver and a statue of Ishtar also made of bronze, and silver, that this is an indication that the deity was not solely represented by his or her statue? The author wonders, whether ? an Ishtar? of metal should be understood to be a symbol or an emblem of sun and moon also mentioned in this vocabulary. During the 1st dynasty of Babylon references in the texts to royal statues surpass exceedingly those of the previous periods; the phrase a 1 a n dX occurs too, but far less frequently. Sumu-la-el, 2nd king of the Babylonian dyn? asty, mentions three divine statues: one of Sar panit and two others of Innana and Nana. Abi eshuh of Babylon had made a statue of Enten for the Ekishnugal at Ur, one of Marduk, and one of Sarpanit. Ammiditana dedicated statues of the protecting goddesses d 1 a m a in gold and ? adorned with gold and precious stones? to e.g. Marduk and Innana. In Samsuditana 's reign there is once again mention made of the manufacture of a couple of lama goddesses. However, it is hardly likely that these protecting lama deities can have functioned as cult statues. The documents of the dynasty of Eshnunna (ruling during the reigns of Shulgi of Ur and Samsuiluna of Babylon) are less specific in their information regarding divine statues, and al? though Ipiqadad (I or II [?]) enumerates an ivory throne with gold incrustation and various attributes for the chief god Tishpak, which ex? cludes the hypothesis of a symbolic representa? tion of the god, any reference to the god him? self has been omitted. This does, therefore, not exclude the possibility of a human substitute. The fact that Belakum refers to the manufac? ture of d i n n a n a ki-ti (dInnana of Kiti), who was worshipped at Ischali and, according to the documents, also in the palace of Eshnunna itself, where she received offerings, leads to the supposition that, even though the word a 1 a n has been omitted, the texts relate to the actual statue of the goddess Innana. It is not surpris? ing either to find references to royal statues in the Eshnunna documents, some of which appear? ing in the year-names. The author concludes her research with the textual evidence from the kingdom of Mari, where she has found few references to divine statues amid the several royal effigies, apart from one of Iasmah-Addu 's year-names which reads: ? The year of Iasmah-Addu in which Nergal has entered his temple?, and a mention in a do cument of Zimrilim of Mari of a divine statue of the goddess Annunit of Sihrim. To this short list must be added the "Cabane" statue dedi? cated by Iasmah-Addu which has been mentioned above, and the fact that Zimrilim furnished the gods with large thrones, in particular the gods Dagan of Terqa, Shamash of Manunim, Adad of Mahanim, and the goddess of Der. Again we can only regret that we have no information about the occupants of these thrones. What can we conclude at the end of this comprehensive study? The archaeological mate? rial to date fails to provide fully conclusive sup? port to counteract the negative result which, ac? cording to Miss Spycket, the cuneiform records supply as regards the existence of divine cult statues in Mesopotamia before the 2nd millen? nium B.C. It will be up to the Sumeriologists to decide whether the author's view that the ex? pression X d Y mu-tud does not apply to the statue of a deity but to the statue proper of the king or ensi (see above). But the almost total absence of cult statues before the early centuries of the 2nd millennium B.C. ? except for the statue of Innana or Naru(n)te [?], dedi? cated by Puzur-Inshushinak and the statue of the minor deity Alia ? seems to agree with Miss Spycket's rather revolutionary proposition. Taking it from there, the author finds the first written references to the actual existence of divine statues, and then only in the year names, in Isin-Larsa times; a period in which also the "dees-se au vase jaillisant" and the "Cabane" statue, both from Mari, appear. The author concludes ?La representation divine n'etait done pas, dans l'esprit des anciens Meso? potamiens, assimilee ? la representation humaine. D'o? l'absence des termes alan ou salmu pour la designer. Peut-etre voyaient-ils vraiment leurs dieux presents dans leur essence divine et sacree ?. Then, once again, she considers the possibi? lity of divine emblems and animal attributes replacing the god, and finally human substitutes ? the king, the ensi, a priest or a priestess ? performing the sacred rites. We can be grateful to the author for her exhaustive documentation, in which all the per? tinent facts and references have methodically been classified. It is to be hoped, and indeed to be expected, that the many questions which Miss Spycket has posed so clearly will be an? swered by future research, archaeological and textual. Her study will prove an invaluable help. Elisabeth C. L. During Caspers 334</page></plain_text>
