Animal Neighbors of the Countryside.-Joseph W. Lippincott. Phila- delphia. Lippincott. 272 pp. $2.50. This is a pleasant book about the lives of many of the common vertebrates. Besides the interesting facts and amusing stories about life histories, the charming illustrations by Lynn Bogue Hunt should ensure its wide circulation among younger readers.-Constance Nice. 67. The Watcher at the Nest. Margaret Morse Nice. 1939. New York. Macmillan. 154 pp. $2.00-A generation or two ago Bradford Torrey, Frank Bolles and a dozen others found a public and a market for simple and sincere account of the lives and surroundings of obscure birds and mammals. It has been a long time since such volumes have been able to make their way without being atro- ciously nature-faked or reduced to the sickening accents of pseudo-juvenility. In the meanwhile a great deal of increasingly turgid water has flowed under the bridges of these quiet streams. The naive delight in the revelation of the minor secrets of nature has been replaced by the consuming ambition to bring it all under the formulas of the latest psychological fad. While Torrey wrote for a quiet audience of rural naturalists in still-Victorian New England, Mrs. Nice's every word must pass under the horn-rims of a thousand graduates of Junior Colleges, whose memories of their biology course are a trifle vague but for an aggressive conviction that it's all easily susceptible to a mechanistic explana- tion and that, above all, you mustn't be sentimental or, (luscious verbal plum !) anthropomorphic. Can Mrs. Nice get away with it? If so, she is doing, if not a worthier, at least a more difficult, thing than all the worthies did half a century ago, and, she acquires merit in proportion. Whether in the first half-dozen essays, which are retellings of the epic of the Song Sparrows, and in which the author bodies forth in "real life" the whole range of modern bird psychology, or in the later numbers,-earlier memories which must depend in greater degree on sheer description and the charm of the simple and enthusiastic style, the book is good work, whether as zoology or as literature. If it fails, the reasons will be social, because the literary type is dead, not because the exponent is not a master. It is as foreign to the nature of the author as it is to the character of her material to represent birds as anything else than purposeful individuals adapting them- selves to circumstances. The pattern Mrs. Nice has advocated so long and played so large a part in building up is shot with increasing degrees of flexibility and variation as the intimacy and continuity of the account increases. Sometimes the reviewer wishes more accent were layed on the flexibility, less on the pattern. The rose-hedge imbroglio came at a time when song was in abeyance, but it called for song, and Uno and 4 M could and did use it copiously. When Una was moved to violate the territorial code unsupported by Uno, she took over many of his functions, then, her object gained, fell back into her prescribed role. Uno transformed his behavior in response to the vagaries of three successive wives in matters as basic as feeding or not feeding the young. Dandelion adapted herself perfectly to changeling young born a week ahead. The pattern has become as rigid as an india-rubber band. If anyone is laboring under the manic-depressive conviction (perhaps specific in reviewers) that all the dullness in the world is finding its way into the ornitho- logical magazines, this is the best medicine that has been distilled these many years.-T. T. McC. 68. A Gathering of Birds.-Donald Culross Peattie. April, 1939, pp. i-xii+ 379. Illustrated by Edward Shenton, New York, Dodd, Mead and Co. $3.00. For this anthology of ornithological prose, Mr. Peattie has selected extracts from the writings of nineteen naturalists who have written on the subject of birds from 1753 to the present day. The first selections are from the pen of William Henry Hudson, the last gleaned from John James Audubon; in between and in the order named, come John Muir, Gilbert White, Cherry Kearton, Gustav</page></plain_text>
