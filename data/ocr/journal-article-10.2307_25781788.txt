<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAMUEL BECKETT AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC INSOLENCE Chris Ackerley Samuel Beckett's writings display a contradictory attitude to Romanticism, their incipient lyricism ruthlessly constrained and the "impulse to animise" rejected in favour of a view of nature as atomistic, mineral and organic. Beckett's distrust of the dictum that "man is the measure of all things" leads in Watt to a sustained critique of the anthropomorphic impulse and of any epistemology (including Romanticism) that thus asserts the self. I then critique, from the perspective of Watt, two Romantic tenets: "mythical fancy" and the transcendental impulse. The essay concludes where it begins, with Beckett's ambiguous attraction to a tradition he rejected, this constituting his experience of the romantic agony. Immediately after the impossible paradigm of Mr Knott's footwear (200-01), Samuel Beckett's most austere and least obviously romantic novel features a curiously lyrical passage in which someone (Watt? Sam? an omniscient narrator? Beckett?) reflects on the passing of time and youth: To think, when one is no longer young, when one is not yet old, that one is no longer young, that one is not yet old, that is perhaps something. To pause, towards the close of one's three hour day, and consider: the darkening ease, the brightening trouble; the pleasure pleasure because it was, the pain pain because it shall be; the glad acts grown proud, the proud acts growing stubborn; the panting the trembling towards a being gone, a being to come; and the true true no longer, and the false true not yet. And to decide not to smile after all, sitting in the shade, hearing the cicadas, wishing it were night, wishing it were morning, saying, No, it is not the heart, no, it is not the liver, no, it is not the prostate, no it is not the ovaries, no, it is muscular, it is nervous. Then the gnashing ends, or it goes on, and one is in the pit, in the hollow, the longing for longing gone, the horror of horror, and one is in the hollow, at</page><page sequence="2">Chris Ackerley the foot of all the hills at last, the ways down, the ways up, and free, free at last, for an instant free at last, nothing at last. (Beckett 1959, 201-02) This paragraph, a relatively late addition to Watt, entered the last draft (NB4, 157)1 as a quasi-independent prose-poem. It forms an interlude before the description of Mr Knott in his nightshirt and the "strange and unseasonable costume" that he adopts at indifferent times of the year, "as though he were unaware of the weather" (202). The narrator then asks: "Does he seek to know again, what is cold, what is heat?" This is rejected as "an anthropomorphic insolence of short duration" (202), only to be replaced by a more lasting one: the speculation that Mr Knott, needing nothing, yet needs a witness to his not needing, "And so he needed to be witnessed" (203). The phrase "anthropomorphic insolence" (202) reflects the dictum of Protagoras that "man is the measure of all things," as interpreted by Wilhelm Windelband with respect to a wider argument: that the Protagorean theory of knowledge, as embraced by Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, and as endorsed by the teachings of Christianity with respect to the immortal soul, has created a philosophical and religious hegemony with such success that we as its heirs some two thousand years later are largely unaware of the degree to which it has infiltrated our every perception. The frustrated impulse towards romantic sentiment or lyricism is a frequent trope in Beckett's writings.2 The phrase, "perhaps something," echoes Watt's "But was not that something" (148), when he sees himself, little, poor, as now littler, poorer; but wakes to find on rising, on descending, Erskine gone and a strange man, Arthur, in the kitchen. Watt does not know when this was, but it happens when the yew is dark green, on a morning soft and white, to the sound of bells, "of chapel bells, of church bells" (149). The sense of a world awakening to Easter (Faust, Parsifal, or the gold and white and blue dawning that ends Part I of Watt) is in poignant contrast to Watt's isolation. Watt arrived at the house of Mr Knott (30) on an evening when the moon was an unpleasant yellow colour;3 but he leaves it on a night of unusual splendour (222). As he moves through hortulan beauties, flowers and grasses brush against him in a way that is not unpleasant, and a "pendulous umbel" lapping against his hat gives him "peculiar satisfaction." The moon and stars pour down on Watt a light "so strong, so pure, so steady and so white"; but Watt's reaction is disgust. This is the "candida luna," or white moon, of Leopardi's "Canto notturno di un 78</page><page sequence="3">Samuel Beckett and Anthropomorphic Insolence pastore errante dell'asia," in which the beauty of the moonlight reveals finally a scene of nothing (Obscure Locks #222.6). Something of this is captured in the Addenda of Watt (249), in a haunting passage that goes back to the sense of Nothingness (the sky above, the waste below) of Quin's first awareness. As early drafts make clear, this, the primal scene of the novel, is indebted to Leopardi's poem, which invokes the littleness of the human spirit against the immensity of the desert and the waste.4 Molloy reacts more passionately to the moon, in a kind of romantic agony.5 Ruled by emotion, he refuses to admit feeling. His anger often rises to lyricism, only to be undercut by "Pah!" or an invective; till he is "restored" to the state of his old ataraxy (Beckett 2006,11.37). Yet the pull of the moon is sometimes too strong; emotion prevails, is recollected, but must be rejected so that the tranquillity of decomposition (the mockery of Wordsworth's "emotion recollected in tranquillity" is manifest) might be restored in the "anguish of return" (38). His condition is essentially that of most of Beckett's protagonists, with the overt rejection of Romanticism ("this business of the moon," 36) countered by an equal and opposite impulse towards subjectivity and lyricism. A like contradiction is manifest in Beckett's attraction to the art of Jack B. Yeats and Caspar David Friedrich, to the poetry of Holderlin and Leopardi, and the music of Schubert, each of these artists portraying the insignificance, the isolation of the human figure in an indifferent world. In my 2005 article, "Inorganic Form: Samuel Beckett's Nature," I surveyed the wider issues of Beckett and Romanticism, beginning with his purgatorial sense of the self as trapped between the rock and the light, of a consciousness denied the metamorphosis it seeks and so condemned to return to the "mineral" from which it somehow arose, as in Genesis 3:19: "for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." I argued that Beckett rejected "the impulse towards anthropomorphism" (Ackerley 2005, 83) by evoking Cezanne to define landscape (and hence nature) as ultimately unintelligible, and by making alienation, the very absence of rapport between himself and nature, his working principle. I cited two letters from Beckett to Thomas MacGreevy (8 and 16 September 1934),6 where Beckett rejects the "animising mode" and expresses the sense of landscape as totally indifferent to man, as atomistic, mineral and inorganic. I showed that despite Beckett's distrust of nature and "the gangrene of Romanticism" (Beckett 2006, IV.547), a sentiment indebted to J-K Huysmann's A rebours (1884; 79</page><page sequence="4">Chris Ackerley usually translated as "Against Nature"), he retained a contradictory attraction towards the romantic, and especially the German Romantik, even as he refused to validate it (Ackerley 2005, 88). I then explored the implications of that contradiction with reference to the range of Beckett's writings, from the Werther-like sorrows of "Assumption" (1929) to the lyrical beauty of Nacht und Trdume (1982) and the haunting echoes of Schubert's Winterreise in What Where (1983). At the heart of that essay lies a theme I wish to explore further, and with explicit reference to Watt. Beckett's rejection of the animising impulse, I argue, is earthed in Wilhelm Windelband's challenge to received ideas of man's place within the natural order. As Windelband notes (73), Greek ethics began with a problem which paralleled that of physics, the relationship between the unchanging order of things (ousis) and the world of change (genesis). He comments on our allegiance to the higher (unchanging) order of things, and to an anthropomorphic principle that has shaped the natural world so intricately that most of Western history and philosophy has simply taken it for granted. Beckett accepted Windelband's thesis that the crucial divide in Greek thought is not, as commonly assumed, that between Aristotelian materialism and Platonic Idealism, but rather that between both these schools, which accepted the immortality of the soul, and the Atomists (Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius), who proclaimed its dissolution at death (the fate of Murphy's ashes is a huge Democritan guffaw). The triumph of Christianity, Windelband indicates, ensured the success of the former school and the virtual eclipse of the latter. Beckett's distrust of anthropomorphism (as of Romanticism) has its roots in precisely this aspect of Atomist thought (Ackerley 2005, 99). His rejection of the "itch to animise" and of any teleological conception of the natural order affirms instead a sense of nature as utterly incommensurate with human expression. Windelband insists, with respect to the relationship between the unchanging order of things and the world of change, on the primary importance of one question: "What is the abiding ground of all such change?" (32). Mr Knott, it seems, abides; his servants come and go; Watt interrogates this question. The pre-Socratics did not have one answer. Heraclitus asserted the primacy of flux and change; but Parmenides the unchanging nature of The One. Windelband comments (50): "The Becoming of Heraclitus produces no Being, as the Being of Parmenides produces no Becoming." Here is one source of the gouffre interdit a nos sondes (Beckett 2006, IV.522) that became for Beckett a 80</page><page sequence="5">Samuel Beckett and Anthropomorphic Insolence supreme metaphor of alienation: the gulf between the finite and the infinite; the subject and the object; Lazarus and Dives (the preterit and the saved); the circle and the square; the rational and the absurd; ourselves and Godot; the self and the world; and - Watt and Knott. If Beckett's thought has any certainties, these surely relate to the sense, however tautological, that this impasse is impassable. Yet the mainstream of Greek thought is concerned with trying to cross that gulf. Pythagoras affirmed mathematical truths as exemplifying the unchanging, the permanent in the midst of occurrence; and this affirmation led directly to the Platonic doctrine of Ideas. Socrates's sense of the underlying laws of nature (physis) and Plato's teleological view of order differ significantly from Aristotle's conception of nature as "the connected system of all living things regarded as a unity" (Windelband, 146); but each, and this is Windelband's insistent point, shares the conviction first uttered by Protagoras, that man is the measure of all things. This dictum is usually flourished as a generalised anthropomorphic principle, but Windelband defines its precise sense, in terms of what is meant to "know" rather than to "perceive." The one thing of lasting value that later philosophers took from the pre Socratics, he says, is Protagoras's theory of knowledge. Protagoras distinguished in a remarkably pre-Kantian way between two kinds of knowing: that of perception to a changing actuality (phenomena); and that of thought to a reality absolute and abiding (Windelband, 104-06). He asserted the subjectivity and hence fallibility of all perception (this he termed "obscure knowledge"), as opposed to the universal nature of that which is known by thought (not as thing-in-itself, but as Idea). Beckett's sense of the disjunction between subject and object derives (at least in part) from this theory of knowledge, as mediated by Windelband who stresses its continuities with Kant. The breakdown of rapport between the self and the world, a vital concern of all Beckett's criticism and writing, stands in contradiction (philosophically speaking) to the principles of pantheism, neo-Platonism or German idealism that underpin the Romantic enterprise, insofar as these assume a bond between the self and what Emerson (for instance) called the Oversoul. Beckett's philosophical notebooks, compiled in the early 1930s, reflect how much of his understanding of western philosophy derives from Windelband.7 Although he read Kant and Schopenhauer extensively in their own words and in other editions, Beckett's sense of the Enlightenment and of German idealism (Fichte, Hegel, Schelling 81</page><page sequence="6">Chris Ackerley and Schleiermacher) seems to have been shaped primarily by Windelband.8 Specifically, Beckett seems to have accepted the paradigm implicit in Windelband of the striking parallel between the Greek and the German philosophical movements, with the consequent distrust, with respect to the latter as a mirror of the earlier, of natural religion, optimism, nature as the basis of both religious and moral feeling, of any philosophy controlled by anthropological interest (Windelband 489-90), or that affirmed a natural feeling for the good as for the beautiful, a fusion of the ethical and the aesthetic (Windelband, 509-10). In the same way, therefore, that he had rejected the ancient Greek teleological conception of nature, Beckett would instinctively distrust (whatever his attraction to it) any eighteenth and nineteenth century affirmation of "the Stoic-Platonic doctrine in its Christian theistic transformation" (Windelband, 503). This is, of course, a sweeping generalisation; but consider Windelband's discussion of "mythical fancy" (119) and his argument that what is rationally necessary must be conceived of as recollection. This colours the Romantic notion of anamnesis, or the myth of the pre existent soul in terms of birth as a forgetting: that before earthly life our souls have beheld the forms of reality in the incorporeal world; the perception of similar things calls remembrance back to those forms forgotten in the corporeal earthly life; and from this awakens the philosophical impulse, the love of the Ideas by which the soul is raised to its true reality. Beckett's rejection of the entire post-Socratean tradition, which fed into neo-Platonism and so into German idealism and Romanticism, made such speculation specious. I consider this sense of mythical fancy with respect to the tale (or myth) in Watt of the famished dog. The rationalist basis of the Platonic doctrine of knowledge and its allegiance to an immaterial reality, Windelband argues (116-18), arise directly from Protagoras's theory of knowledge', whereas Democritus held that the only thing that could be known, if but obscurely and partially, was the evidence of perception. Beckett was intrigued by this, particularly as it affected the post-Romantic understanding of nature and of God. As one who preferred goats to sheep, his distrust of the impulse towards anthropomorphism, of landscape "promoted" to the emotions of the hiker,9 reflects precisely this aspect of Atomist thought: a rejection of the line of inquiry from Socrates and Plato to Cartesian rationalism, in favour of the neglected and largely rejected atomistic tradition associated with Democritus. This alternative tradition asserted 82</page><page sequence="7">Samuel Beckett and Anthropomorphic Insolence the primacy of the particular over the idea; and so underpins Beckett's sense of demented particularity, his rejection of "the anthropomorphism of the inhuman necessities that provoke the chaos" for the "straws, flotsam, etc., names, dates, births and deaths" that constituted all that he could know, or as he formulated it in the German Diaries (notebook 4, 15 January 1937): "I say the background and the causes are an inhuman and incomprehensible machinery and venture to wonder what kind of appetite it is that can be appeased by the modern animism that consists in rationalising them. Rationalism is the last form of animism" (qtd. in Knowlson, 244). The sense of purposiveness (of nature as ordered, teleological, or with an end) led, Windelband contends (182), to the reasoned conviction that the earth and the heaven and all that is in them are arranged for man; a conviction ratified by Genesis, where man is given dominion over the beast of the field and the fowls of the air. This is a supreme anthropomorphic insolence. Windelband notes in defence of Epicurus (182) that the teleological view leads to "anthropological excrescences"; an example may be found in the drafts of Watt (Obscure Locks #57.4), in the bond between Arsene and his Indian Runner Duck. Arsene could say: "Go! And the duck went, and Come! And the duck came, and Do this! And the duck did that. So extraordinary is the effect of God's image." It is reassuring to know that man (made in God's image) has dominion over the duck. Matthew Feldman's recent study of Beckett's philosophical notebooks sums up the issue: "Protagorean relativism, according to which things are for every individual as they appear to him"; this constitutes "phenomenalism in so far as it teaches knowledge of the phenomenon limited to the individual and the moment: it is scepticism in so far as it rejects all knowledge that transcends that." (Feldman, 37) My argument, reduced to its fundamental sounds, is that in Watt Beckett uses this distinction to interrogate Windelband's thesis of Being and Becoming, and to explore the consequences of Watt's attempt to cross the gulf, the divide between genesis and ousis (phenomenon and transcendence). This finds frequent expression in Watt, but most curiously in Arsene's sunlit epiphany. The blatant anthropomorphism of the dictum that man is the measure of all things, then, in its broader form, is an insolence. Watt rejects it when he tries to distinguish, with respect to the Galls father and son, between the statements "nothing had happened" and "a thing that was nothing had happened" (76). He tries to elicit something from 83</page><page sequence="8">Chris Ackerley this, and concludes: "For the only way one can speak of nothing is to speak of it as though it were something, just as the only way one can speak of God is to speak of him as though he were a man, which to be sure he was, in a sense, for a time, and as the only way one can speak of a man, even our anthropologists have realised that, is to speak of him as though he were a termite" (77). Thus it can be said of God only that he has no qualities known to man, that "no name names him," and that "we can predicate of God only what he is not" (Windelband, 237; 290). Such thinking fails to deter Molloy: "What I liked in anthropology was its inexhaustible faculty of negation, its relentless definition of man, as though he were no better than God, in terms of what he is not" (Beckett 2006,11.35). The more precise definition of the Protagorean dictum, in terms of an obscure perception of a constantly changing phenomenal world, also remains problematic, as Watt's experience with the pot (Pot) proves. Looking at a pot, or thinking of a pot, Watt says in vain: "Pot, pot" (81): "Well, perhaps not quite in vain, but very nearly. For it was not a pot, the more he looked, the more he reflected, the more he felt sure of that, that i[t] was not a pot at all. It resembled a pot, it was almost a pot, but it was not a pot of which one could say, Pot, pot, and be comforted." Watt is troubled by the relationship between the form and/or idea of the Pot, as opposed to the particularity of the pot itself: "And it was just this hairbreadth departure from the nature of a true pot that so excruciated Watt" (81). Watt's inability to understand the nature of a pot and his failure to be comforted by a pillow of old words reflects the complex relationship between knowledge and perception. He seems to be seeking the semantic succour that derives from the desire that things will consent to be named, with their time-honoured names (84). This is a curiously pre-lapsarian view of language in which word and referent are one; and when it breaks down confusion ensues. Such "fragility of the outer meaning" (73) has a bad effect on Watt, who because of his "peculiar character" is obliged to inquire into what things mean, "oh not into what they really meant, his character was not so peculiar as all that, but into what they might be induced to mean" (75). Watt confuses langue and parole (which Saussure had kept rigorously apart), and despite his attempt to try on names, as a woman hats (83), his pot will not become a Pot. Watt's ancient error, the wish to know, frustrates his attempts to cross this semantic and perceptual gulf. 84</page><page sequence="9">Samuel Beckett and Anthropomorphic Insolence Another way to express the loss of semantic rapport is, in Watt's words, a "loss of species" (85); that is, the loss of the form or Ideal needed to reify the existence of the particular, to make the ideal real. Windelband comments (140): "The universal is real or actual only in the particular; the particular is only because in it the universal realises itself." He continues (142-43): "the species exists only insofar as it realises itself in individual things as their truly existing essence and the individual thing exists only as the species comes to its phenomenological manifestation in it." Thus, loss of species constitutes a loss of Being. The argument curiously anticipates How It Is, where this phrase, "loss of species," is reiterated as the unnamed protagonist tries in vain to avoid the conclusion that he is the "sole elect," of necessity individual. Beckett was briefly content with Windelband's solution to the Proustian equation: "at once an evocation and a direct perception, real without being merely actual, ideal without being merely abstract, the ideal real" (Beckett 2006, IV.544). This, some might say, is perhaps something; but by the time Beckett wrote Watt such Proustian assurance had broken down, largely because of his reading of Fritz Mauthner, who contended that there can be no thought without words, that words in themselves are inane, verba inania, lacking substance or sense, and so our thoughts are inane, never "obviating the void" (Ackerley and Gontarski, 359). This leads to nominalist irony of the kind that Beckett had identified in the German Letter of 1937; Watt in these terms is an inane comedy. Beckett had copied out Mauthner's attack on "Anthropomorphismus" (TCD MS 10971/5, 1; Mauthner, 11.474), underlining: "Der mittelalterliche Nominalismus ist der erste Versuch der wirklichen Selbstzersetzung des metaphorischen Denkens" (The nominalism of the Middle Ages in the first attempt at a genuine self-destruction of metaphorical thinking; 11.474). The passage concludes: "Das lezte Wort des Denkens kann nur die negative Tat sein, die Selbstzersetzung des Anthropomorphismus, die Einsicht in die profonde Weisheit des Vico: homo no intelligendo fit omnia" (The last word of thought can only be the negative act, the self-destruction of anthropomorphism, the insight into the profound wisdom of Vico: not everything is intelligible to man; TCD MS 10971/5, 4; Mauthner, 11.479). This opens the way to an "inane" comedy, a rejoicing in the irrational, as Moran with his bees: "Here is something I can study all my life and never understand" (2006,11.163). Or it may lead to tragedy, as in the self-destruction of Watt. 85</page><page sequence="10">Chris Ackerley One of Windelband's major themes is the growth of science out of "mythical fancy" (119), from the curious fictions that societies have evolved to "explain" phenomena. That fancy can be seen in the suggestions of Mr Knott as a sun-god: rising sometimes late and sometimes early; seen at the eastern window in the morning and at the western window in the evening; disappearing behind and emerging from bushes as if they were clouds; and "rising" from sleep to vigil and "setting" from vigil to sleep (Beckett 1959, 86). This is an accepted myth, but the tale of the famished dog (the inversion of 'God' is automatic) demonstrates neatly the inception of a new mythical fancy. Empirically speaking, Watt's instructions (91) are simple: he is to give the food left over from Mr Knott's meals to "the dog" (91). Since (the text informs us) there is no dog in the house, "it was necessary" that a dog from outside should call there. However, such a dog requires an "establishment" in order to be; and before many pages are turned there comes into being a series of dogs and the entire Lynch family, generated by a chain of contingency that stretches to the beginning of time and embraces all extension; a process explicable only by the complementary myth of pre-established harmony. The "necessity" is purely verbal, nominalist; yet the definite article, the deictic pronoun 'this', the indicative mood of 'was' and the proper noun 'Kate' soon testify to the dog's tangible existence: "The name of this dog was Kate" (112); and her eating from the dish with two dwarves standing by is substantive. Compare "in certain waters certain fish": "But do such fish exist? Yes, such fish exist, now" (120). Again, the reification is verbal; but like the hronir of Borges's Tlon such idealist constructs add provinces to being, even as their existence is purely nominalist. My earlier commentary cynically concluded, "In like manner, perhaps, have countless human societies reified their nominalist 'gods'."10 For all his admiration of Proust and Joyce, Beckett distrusted the Proustian moment and the Joycean epiphany, those Modernist and secular manifestations of mystical intimations, of Wordsworth's mysterious "spots of time," in which the quotidian is apparently illuminated by the timeless. Moments of involuntary memory for Proust redeem the past, and the epiphany for Joyce affirms the destiny of the artist as priest of the imagination: A Portrait of the Artist recounts the forging of the aesthetic of the romantic young Stephen Dedalus in the smithy of his soul, until his "mettle" attains the classical temper. Yet we are "frequently reminded of this romantic strain in Proust" (Beckett 2006, IV.547); and Joyce's most celebrated epiphany, Gabriel Conroy's 86</page><page sequence="11">Samuel Beckett and Anthropomorphic Insolence experience at the end of "The Dead," retains elements of the romantic in such phrases as "His soul swooned slowly" and images of the snow "falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling." Beckett's "A Wet Night" parodies both the Proustian salon of Le Temps retrouve and the end of "The Dead" (rain falling on the mountains and the plains, and notably on the Central Bog);11 and in so doing offers a critique of the epiphanic moment, though less of the experience than of its meaning. At the end of "A Wet Night" (and at the end of Dream of Fair to middling Women), Belacqua is invited into the Casa Alba to share with his Ideal Lady the fire and a bottle; but the very real belly-ache that troubles him on the way home undercuts any easy romanticism. Even so, in an aesthetically complex way, but one deliberately and ironically distanced from Proust and Joyce, the ideal has been made real, and a curiously muted joy arises, despite the rain. The more cynical test of this process is Arsene's experience (42 45), as he sits on the step, in the yard, looking at the light, on the wall.12 Something suddenly happens, "Something slipped" (42); with the effect that his "personal system" (43) is so distended that the distinction between what is inside it and what is outside it is not easy to draw. This is precisely the moment of Joycean epiphany, in which the dichotomy of subject and object is momentarily overcome; and it leaves Arsene perplexed: "But in what did the change consist! What was changed, and how?" (44). Arsene defines his sense of the moment as "existence off the ladder," as outside time; but the experience is, ironically, temporary: even if he has somehow climbed to the place where all the ladders end (as in Yeats's 'The Circus Animals' Desertion'), he is now back where he was, as he was, in the rag and bone shop of ordinary existence. Yet something remains: in his opinion it was not an illusion ("that presence without, that presence within"), though he is buggered if he can understand how it could have been anything else (45). The experience, in Proustian terms, is both ideal and real, but Arsene (like Beckett) refuses to give it any transcendental validation. The reader is offered a similar experience later in the novel: the frog song (137-38) acts as a parable of periodicity, but one that may say more about the anthropomorphic attribution of value to symmetry than about the phenomena observed. As Arsene might say, to conclude from this that the universe is harmonious would, I think, be rash. As I suggest in Obscure Locks (138): "The frog song illustrates, in a ruthless reductio, the machinery of the Joycean epiphany or Proustian moment, but one terrifying difference between Beckett on the one hand, and Joyce and 87</page><page sequence="12">Chris Ackerley Proust on the other, is the refusal to attribute transcendental value to such synchronicity." Such sentiments in Beckett reflect the tempering of a romantic sensibility into a modernist (perhaps, a post-modernist) temperament. This is an impossibly large theme, but Beckett in his critique of anthropomorphism and mythical fancy, and in his refusal to validate the transcendental, may be responding to Windelband's sense of the Romantik in terms of the impulse towards the unity of Reason and Nature (603), which, he argues, can become complete only in religion: "It is the highest task that has ever been set philosophy, to comprehend the world as a development of those principles or determinations which form the content of the divine mind" (611). From the perspective of the twenty-first century and after decades of incessant assaults on the coherence of self, let alone that of the divine mind, this seems somewhat quixotic: Romanticism as the last ditch of the anthropomorphic, and the brave battle of German idealists such as Schleiermacher, Hegel, Schelling and Fichte (and, in the English tradition, Coleridge) to affirm the neo-Platonic as an enterprise inevitably doomed. Yet, as Windelband argues at the end of his History of Philosophy, in a section called "The Metaphysics of the Irrational" (615-22) and from which Beckett took extensive notes (TCD MS 1097, 251r-54), the dialectic of history wills that the "System of Reason" shall be changed into its opposite (615), and the transmutation of God into the world must again become a problem (616). Windelband notes (620) that the Irrational came to full development in Schopenhauer with the removal of the religious element; and that his pessimism, thus grounded metaphysically, finally expresses the absolute unreason of the objectless will. Beckett's intellectual sympathies found their substrate here, but his isolated human figures, caught between the rock and the light, try in vain to resolve the contradictory impulses in the endless surge, the systole-diastole of Being and Becoming. And Mr Knott abides, if not as an anthropomorphic insolence, as still an impossible impasse. Notes 1.
