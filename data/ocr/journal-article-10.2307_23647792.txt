Some of this ornamentation consists of script, usually eastern in flavor, sometimes close to Greek or Hebrew, often close to Arabic, but in fact in no known language: for the sake of convenience I call them "pseudoscripts" or, collectively, "pseudoscript." These apparently arbitrary strokes, slashes, and squiggles correspond to individual letterforms; their sequences sometimes repeat the same form at considered intervals, giving the array the appearance of having a linguistic structure. Apparently illegible marks designed to carry a message would normally be classed as encryptions, but only very few of the pseudoscripts, so far as we know, are messages to be deciphered with a secret key. The rest only resemble encryptions, sometimes even alluding to encryption procedures. The most carefully considered pseudoscripts reveal a high degree of interest in the routines of producing and reading texts; some train attention on the differences between writing and ornament; all of them bear the double message that this is script and that it is not legible to you, the viewer, though it is presumably intelligible to the sacred figures who bear it. The very unintelligibility of these scripts could be said, in some cases, to mark a gap between a fallen present and a sacred past. The intelligence gap can be understood to belong to the viewer, who cannot read these marks, or to the producer, who is only able to make marks that resemble those of a language he does not know, a language either dead or foreign, or foreign in the sense of otherworldly. In either case, pseudoscripts clarify the idea that there is a look to sacred script, a look that can be transmitted even in the absence of understood content. Pseudoscript gives a style to the foreign and the sacred, prompting by consequence the idea that the foreign and the sacred have a style—indeed, that style may be the only means by which the sacred is made known to a belated and fallen culture. During the period in which it flourished in Western art (it appears with greatest frequency between 1300 and 1500), pseudoscript was a laboratory for isolating an idea of style as such. This article is presented as a series of notes because the problem opens out in many directions that only a book-length study could treat; the format also suggests an arena where provisional and experimental thinking about the problem is encouraged. Pseudoscripts appear throughout European art in this period, but initial surveys suggest that they are overwhelmingly more numerous in Italian than in Iberian art or the art of northern Europe. This article concentrates on Italian examples. Pseudoscripts are a realm of experimentation largely ungoverned by the oversight of patrons or ecclesiastical authorities. It is one of the few areas in the painting of this period where artists exercised improvisational freedom in the handling of the brush, the stylus, the chisel, or other marking instrument. The invented marks occur even in works where they would have been impossible to perceive in their original location, such as on the sleeve of a Prophet by Donatello for the third story of the campanile of Florence (fig. 1). Whether it is the master or the assistant who attended to these areas, the invented letterforms constitute an often-overlooked artistic signature. 3. A familiar phenomenon in art of many periods and cultures, pseudoscript was cultivated in Italian painting and sculpture amid increasingly intensive contact with the eastern Mediterranean in the wake of the Latin conquest of Constantinople in 1204. In Cimabue's Maestà in Bologna, the cloth of honor behind the enthroned figures carries real Arabic letterforms; one can make out several lams and aliphs. On the curtain behind the Virgin in Duccio's great Maestà in Siena, we see a more kuficizing Arabic script; the curtain curls over at the right edge, revealing the textile pattern (and its woven text) from behind: a letterform close to one from the textile's front can even be seen in reverse (fig. 2). It is a not quite exact reversal; this is a puzzle that,</page><page sequence="3">230 RES 59/60 SPRING/AUTUMN 2011 ■■Mi Figure 1. Donatello, Prophet, 1420s, detail.

In Mamluk brassware also seems to have played a role in Giotto's Arena Chapel, many of the figures carry on their Filarete's bronze doors for St. Peter's of the 1440s. There clothing a script that is remarkably close to Phags-pa, we see haloes with arabizing script behind the heads of the script adopted throughout the Mongolian empire St. Peter, St. Paul, and Christ, conforming rather closely in the later thirteenth century. In his later work, Giotto to the script seen on Mamluk vessels of the sort imported turned to scripts that run closer to Arabic (figs. 12-14). into Italy in substantial numbers at that time, several of The painting of this period clearly reflects the dramatic which still exist in Italian collections.

At the center of the globe— X, or rather +, marks the spot—is Jerusalem (fig. 6). The division of the world into the three continents goes back to antiquity, but the word "Europe" was not used in common parlance, and the word "European" was virtually unknown. To describe the people from this part of the world during this period as Europeans is inevitably to project onto that time and that place the resonances that the word carries now—such as the implications that Europe is central and that it is the originator of cultural forms that are emulated throughout the world. In this period and for centuries before, this part of the world was most often designated as the Latin West when it was designated at all, and, as Fra Angelico's map suggests, it was most emphatically not the center of the world. Moreover, it knew itself not to be the center, in part because it did not have a center. After the fall of Rome there was a succession of weak popes and various relatively unsuccessful claimants to the mantle of the Roman imperium. The Latin West also had to contend with the not unreasonable claim that the true heir of the Christian world was not Rome but Byzantium. There was a-center in the Latin consciousness, as Angelico's globe indicates, but it was far away and difficult of access, especially after the Holy Land came under Muslim domination in the seventh century. This center was always more fantasy than reality, and as such it exerted a powerful symbolic pull, occasionally impelling real and violent efforts of recovery, such as the crusades. The crusades, in turn, fed the late-medieval imaginary with a steady stream of reports, relics, images, and other information, intensifying the relation with the imagined center. 8. The Latin West cannot properly be called a diaspora, but it did arguably have a diasporic structure. Unlike the neighboring diasporic populations of Judaism and Islam, however, the Christians of the Latin West, as the term suggests, read their sacred texts in translation. They never forgot this fact. Magical charms and amulets regularly maintained textual incantations in something approaching Greek or Hebrew, and often enough in mere gibberish, in the belief that the formulas lost efficacy in translation. Ecclesiastical benedictions and blessings, particularly in the context of exorcism, maintained Greek and Hebrew words intact.

On January 31, 1492, the very day that news arrived in Rome of the Spanish-Catholic victory at Granada, a signal relic from the Holy Land was rediscovered in the church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome, a church under Spanish patronage. This was the titulus crucis, the wooden tablet mounted on the cross that Pontius Pilate had had carved with an inscription that read, in the three languages of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, "Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews." This artifact, which still exists, carries one signal feature unremarked in the biblical text: The Greek and Latin text are written in mirror script from right to left. Reports of the discovery of early 1492 were sent far and wide; one was duly sent from Rome to the de facto ruler of Florence, Lorenzo de' Medici, as well as to the papal ambassador in Florence, who was in close contact with the most important scholars there, including Angelo Poliziano and Pico del la Mirándola. It was probably shortly after the arrival of this news that Michelangelo, a teenage pupil of Poliziano and a lodger at Lorenzo de' Medici's palace, carved the famous crucifix for the church of Santo Spirito, whose titulus bears the telltale feature of the backwards Greek and Latin script (fig. 8). The report sent to Florence announcing the discovery of the titulus offered an explanation of this curious feature, proposing that the Greek and the Latin were written backwards in conformity with the more venerable Hebrew, as "they did not want to go against the primary way of ordering script that belongs to Hebrew letters." Brought into the proximity of the more sacred language, the Greek and Latin switch direction and march backwards, as it were performing a kind of pilgrimage. The backwards orientation of the Greek and Latin is an acknowledgment that they are later derivations, departures from the Hebrew source. Some scholars at this time held that Hebrew was the true original language, spoken by Adam and Eve in paradise. Others contended that it came into being only after the expulsion from Eden, remaining dominant until Babel. Whether primordial or not, Hebrew was far older and thus more authoritative than Greek or Latin. In 1524 the English Hebraist Robert Wakefield explained, citing Aristotle's words about the movement of the heavens, that the Hebrew language follows the example of nature by going from right to left, putting the Hebrews in greater harmony with God's order than the Greeks and Latins, who somehow got themselves into the bind of writing in such a way that the pen is in the way of the letters one is trying to put down. For such reasons, Hebrew was Figure 8. Michelangelo, Crucifix, 1492, detail of titulus. Santo Spirito, Florence. Illustration: rendering by the author. believed to have powers that the other languages did not have. In the years just preceding the discovery of the titulus, Pico della Mirándola, who had been engaged in an intensive course of Hebrew and Kabbalah study, affirmed that the only names that were effective in magic were Hebrew or derived from Hebrew. 12. The year 1492 was thus a high-water mark of the Italian fascination with its own Eastern roots. It was the year that the titulus with its strange script was discovered and Columbus reached what he believed to be the coast of Asia in the company of his Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic-speaking interpreter; it was also the year of the supposed (and highly celebrated) discovery by the Friar Annius of Viterbo of a cache of ur-ancient archeological finds, including hieroglyphs commemorating the presence of the Egyptian god Osiris on Italian soil. Not long after this point, that basic orientation—the idea that it was necessary to return to or recover an Eastern origin—was to fade. Eurocentrism as we know it was soon to emerge as a determining conception of the world. The pseudoscripts are a powerful index of the fundamental orientation of Western art up to this point. Post-Roman Western art before the sixteenth century could thus be called pre-European art. 13. The entire culture of courtly silks in late medieval Europe was based on imports from the eastern Mediterranean and from Spain, and many of these pailes d'orient and porpre sarazinesche carried Arabic script. Sometimes these prestigious textiles were adapted for sacred objects and implements, used to line reliquary boxes, for example, or adapted as liturgical vestments or altar cloths. When silk production got going in Italy in the fourteenth century, the Italians imitated the</page><page sequence="9">236 RES 59/60 SPRING/AUTUMN 2011 * Figure 9. Nasrid textile, fourteenth century, detail1 Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. patterns of the Eastern silks right down to the scripts. Painters often functioned as designers of textiles, so it is no surprise that they should have paid careful attention to the silks that appeared in their own paintings and sculptures. It is thus notable that the garments worn by the figures represented in the art of the period should be so freely invented. In a painting of the Egyptian Saint Catherine, the Spanish artist Fernando Yañez adapted patterns of the sort found on a Nasrid curtain now in the Metropolitan Museum (figs. 9-10). The pattern on her sleeves is very close to that of the curtain, but no garment with script filled sleeves of this sort was ever actually produced. The artist tailored his saint's clothing as it were from whole cloth. The garment may be fanciful, but the transcription of the interlaced forms is extremely faithful. 14. Why do we see such a prevalence of pseudoscript in Western art of this period when accurate transcription of the Arabic inscriptions on Islamic objects and textiles was clearly possible for Western artists? The pseudoscripts cannot simply be ascribed to incompetent or merely lazy transcription. When copying letters of a foreign language errors will inevitably creep in, due to the fact that it is difficult to tell which parts of a given letter are formative and which parts are ticks of a scribal style. But even a very faulty transcription produces some areas of correspondence. Instead, what we have is a great number of invented scripts and then a few scattered cases of startlingly accurate transcription, such as the adroitly rendered Arabic inscription in thuluth script from one of WiTOWlfffflffTI OjlWlfltM I Figure 10.

Excellent transcribers of forms, Renaissance artists operating at the edge of conventional iconography, such as Pisanello could have copied foreign scripts the invented scripts entered a realm of equally daring exactly if they had wanted. Instead, they opted, over and conceptual experimentation that clearly attracted the over again, to place scripts of their own devising in their art makers, who poured their ingenuity into it, and on paintings and sculptures. A negative explanation would occasion perhaps intrigued their clients, have it that this reticence was designed to avoid the danger of unwittingly transmitting un-Christian messages. Outright challenges to Christian orthodoxy could be contained in the Arabic inscriptions.

The letters do not form recognizable words and the letterforms themselves are freely played with. There is an upside-down and backwards F, a backwards N, a backwards B, and so on. Moreover, the letters are imbricated in ornamental lines, making them difficult to discern at all. We are made to wonder, which lines in this welter of striations belong to the letterforms and which lines do not? The logic here seems to be that one can reverse-engineer an archaic script by turning familiar script in unfamiliar directions and processing it through a mesh of ornament. 19. The main point of pseudoscript is to indicate, first, that these marks are linguistic in structure, and, second, that we cannot read them, or have lost the capacity Figure 13. Giotto, Mary and Jesus, ca. 1320, detail. National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Photo: NYU Luna Imaging. to read them. Since they are, in fact, impossible to read, one could say they mimic encryptions, messages that have been deliberately rendered illegible to all readers not in possession of the message's key, with the différence that here there is no key. These scripts are going through the motions of cryptography. Rather than call them pseudoscripts we could call them pseudo encryptions. It is possible that under sufficiently patient scrutiny some of them will turn out to be encrypted not only in appearance but in fact. Cryptography was, after all, a highly developed art in the period. Besides writing treatises on painting, sculpture, and architecture, Leon Battista Alberti wrote a treatise on ciphers. The holy grail of cryptographers, right down to the present day, is the so-called Voynich manuscript at Yale University, now dated by radio carbon anaylsis to the early fifteenth century. Statistical analysis of character frequency, word length, and repetition distance distribution indicates strongly that this array of characters has a structure resembling that of language. But does that mean it is encoded—that it is language? The field of Voynich studies remains divided.</page><page sequence="14">Nagel: Twenty-five notes on pseudoscript in Italian art 241 Figure 14. Giotto, Mary and Jesus, ca. 1320, detail. National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Photo: NYU Luna Imaging. How many of the pseudoscripts bear a real and not only apparent linguistic structure? How many of them are in fact encoded? It would be necessary to assemble enough examples and put them through the sort of analysis that has been given to the Voynich manuscript. For the examples that do turn out to resemble language, it would then be necessary to submit them to the comparative linguistic analysis that has been applied to hitherto undeciphered ancient languages. The goal of such an analysis would not be one of decipherment, in the first instance. Even in the case of unencoded pseudoscripts, such comparative analysis would indicate the degree of cryptographic and linguistic sophistication that went into making them. The pseudoscripts may emerge from such analysis as early applied efforts to point to common structures among languages and also to suggest an earlier form of language. That is, pseudoscripts may be an early form of the comparative analysis now applied, with the aid of computers, by the students of linguistics and artificial intelligence. Such analysis of the pseudoscripts might, indeed, open up new ways of approaching the Voynich manuscript and related problems. Could it be that pseudoscript was a more advanced art than the students of the Voynich have allowed? If pseudocripts seem to carry a linguistic structure and yet are not in fact encoded, they provide a primary body of contextual evidence by which to test the hypothesis, advanced by some, that the Voynich is a vast pseudoscript. tk.

The word ornament is "kosmos" in Greek because ornament bespeaks the ordering of the universe. Ornament is a kind of pre-language, and it is also the direction in which language moves when it aims to become universal or original. Ornament is the orientation of language. Or, rather, it is the language of things. 21. In Raphael's Terranuova Madonna in Berlin, we see an M for Mary in the middle of her collar, on either side of which are mirrored bracket-like forms, and then extending to either side there is a kind of script (fig. 16). Unlike the scripts reviewed so far, this one seems devised to avoid obvious resemblance to known oriental languages. Instead, Raphael has endeavored to imagine an archaic or Edenic script hovering at the frontier of ornament. Each of the letters is delicately balanced and yet manages to avoid mere symmetry; at the same time, they verge on geometrical figures, just beyond script. But then viewed another way, they are just Latin letters hiding in plain sight. There is an R, an ornamental M, and a Z, as well as a K, and an A. 22.

These last two letters are a mini-disquisition on the question of language and ornament. On the I the upright is what matters; the flourishes at the bottom and top are decorative. In the S, the very same curling form at the bottom and the somewhat more ample curve at the top are, instead, constitutive of the letterform. Just a few years before this painting was made, Mantegna's patron Isabella d'Este wrote to her humanist advisor, Paride Ceresara, thanking him for having sent her a sampling of "Syrian or Babylonian sacred letters" (probably Syriac or Aramaic). She asks him, however, to clarify whether certain features of the letterforms belong to the letters or are merely ornamental, solum per adornamento, in which case she asks him to send a transcription of the letters pure and simple, schiette et semplici, "as they were written in their own time." In the word following nostris, foeda, the D is backwards and carries a rather extravagant flourish at the top. The A that follows it could easily be misread as an X if some of its flourishes were deemed essential features. We are able to parse the text because we have the clear Latin capitals directly above for reference. Would we be able to navigate legibly through these forms without the help of this inscription in Latin majuscules before our eyes? Given that the identity of the two texts—one highly legible, one not—has been missed by generations of scholars intent on deciphering all the clues in this painting, it is highly likely that if it had been presented entirely on its own this second inscription would be consigned even today to the family of pseudoscripts. Mantegna thus shared Isabella's interest in the frontier between ornament and script. His contribution to the discussion is the playfully disguised text on the scroll, where a perfectly legible script hides in plain sight Under a thin veil of ornament. It is a pseudo-pseudoscript, a commentary on a now centuries-old tradition of pseudoscript in art. The trick he plays on his viewers serves as a demonstration of how easily a real message can be camouflaged by ornament. It also admonishes, conversely, that what looks like mere ornament, or mere pseudoscript, may in fact be message-bearing. This jeu d'esprit strongly encourages a closer look at the bottom-most script of our scroll, which contains mostly real Hebrew letters in an apparently nonsensical jumble (fig. 18). Perhaps here, too, we are being offered a challenge of decipherment. In Mantegna's painting, we have reached the point where the whole tradition of pseudoscript is itself undergoing scrutiny and recognized for what it is, which is, among other things, a meditation on encoding itself.</page><page sequence="18">Nagel: Twenty-five notes on pseudoscript in Italian art 245 24. The no-longer-quite pseudoscripts of Mantegna in 1502 and Raphael in 1504 announce the end of a history. Shortly after this point, pseudoscript falls away from visual art. It is rare to see it in a work of art after 1520. We might explain this as evidence of cultural progress: knowledge of the relevant languages had increased to the point where orientalizing gibberish now seemed embarrassing or downright silly, and the alternative of introducing real Hebrew or real Arabic seemed too heavy-handed. It is more likely that the disappearance of the pseudoscripts has rather to do with changes in the status and claims of art. The art from Cimabue to, let us say, Mantegna and Raphael is an art that is persistently concerned with the problem of reference, that is, with truth in reporting; it deals in true likenesses, authentic portraits, reliable copies, and so on. The pseudoscripts, far from being naive and silly, are bound up in the referential commitments of this art. Those commitments fall away in the sixteenth century under the critical pressure exerted by, among other things, the Reformation. It became possible to describe all works of art, both present and past, as fictions, damningly as nothing more than fictions in the eyes of Protestant reformers, and, affirmatively, as nothing less than fictions for, say, Giorgione, or Titian, or those who appreciated their art. And fictions do not need pseudoscripts. 25. After 1500, works of art do not simply expel the pseudoscripts:They become pseudoscripts, writ large. Invented scripts are improvised forms that seem to imply a set of rules, forms that insistently raise the question whether they are meaningful or not, whether they are a language or not, whether they have a grammar and a history. The pseudoscripts thus raise questions that apply to works of art generally. So much is suggested by a 1506 letter from the poet Pietro Bembo to the same Isabella d'Este, where he informs her that if she wants a painting by Giovanni Bellini for her studiolo, she will have to leave the invention to the artist: The subject that you tell me I should have him design will have to be accommodated to the imagination of the one making the work, and he does not like his tool [il suo stile] to be given overly assigned terms [molto signati termini], as he is accustomed to wander at will in his paintings. Artistic freedom of invention is here described as a work of the pen (stile) that does not hold to the given terms, a description that makes painting sound quite a lot like producing a script of one's own invention. The combination of free handling and fictional rule-making characteristic of the pseudoscripts now extends to the entire work, not only in the literal sense of experiments with open brushwork, which do start occurring at this date, but in this deeper sense. When pseudoscripts pass from being a feature of art to being a model for art, the history of art comes into view as nothing more, and nothing less, than a history of ways of doing things, which is to say a history of styles. Religious art can be seen as nothing but a manipulation of stylings of the sacred, and indeed was condemned as such by Protestant reformers. Or, style can emerge as the fundamental category for understanding how humans shape and interact with their world. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES 1. On pseudoscripts in Italian art, see G.

For the whole sacred text has been drawn from Greek and Hebrew, and philosophy has been derived from these sources and from Arabic; but it is impossible that the proprietas of one language should be preserved in another. . . . Therefore no Latin will be able to understand as he should the wisdom of the sacred Scripture and of philosophy, unless he understands the languages from which they were translated." See also B.

On the phenomenon of architectural imitation, see, principally, R.

One of the great instances of architectural imitation, and an important pilgrimage target of the later Middle Ages, was the house of the Virgin miraculously (re)constructed in Walsingham, England. Erasmus visited Walsingham in 1512 and then offered a semi-fictional account of the visit in his Colloquy "A Pilgrimage for Religion's Sake," in Collected Works 40 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1997), pp. 619-674. Erasmus actually left a votive tablet at the shrine with a poem inscribed in Greek to the Virgin (see p. 651, note 78). In the dialogue, its reception is described; some thought it to be in Hebrew, some in Arabic, some thought it mere gibberish (p. 636): Ogygius: He asks if I was the man who two years earlier had put up a votive tablet in Hebrew. I admit it. Menedemus: Do you write Hebrew? Ogygius: Of course not, but anything they don't understand they call Hebrew. . . . [The keeper of the shrine] tells me how hard many persons toil to read those lines and how often they wipe their spectacles in vain. Whenever some aged person came along he was marched off to the tablet. One would say the letters were Arabic; another, that they were fictitious characters. 9.

See the entry on Pisanello's drawing by Carmen Bambach in Byzantium: Faith and Power, ed. H. C. Evans (New York: Metropolitan Museum, 2004), cat. no. 318. For another example of a legible Arabic text in a Renaissance work of art, see M. Bernardini, "Un'iscrizione araba in una vetrata nella chiesa della SS. Annunziata a Firenze," in Arte d'Occidente, Temi e metodi: Studi in onore di Angiola Maria Romanini, ed. A. M. Romanini and A. Cadei (Rome: Edizioni Sintesi Informazione, 1999), III: 1023-1030. Gentile da Fabriano fashioned letterforms so close to Arabic in various paintings that scholars have been induced to read them as actual Arabic texts or as encryptions of Christian messages using the Arabic alphabet. See G. Grassi "Le iscrizioni arabo-islamiche nell'opera di Gentile da Fabriano," in Nuovi studi sulla pittura tardogotica: intorno a Gentile da Fabriano, ed. A. De Marchi (Livorno: Sillabe, 2007), and R. Sellheim, "Die Madonna mit der Schahada," in FestschriftWerner Caskel (Leiden, 1968), pp. 308-315. S. Auld, "Kuficising Inscriptions in the Work of Gentile da Fabriano," Oriental Art 32 (1986):246-265, usefully surveys all of Gentile's inscriptions, finding Arabic letterforms but no legible messages in Gentile's arabizing inscriptions. On the Egyptian platter with the name of Mohammed, together with a useful translation of the relevant document, see R. S. Nelson, "Letters and Language/Ornament and Identity in Byzantium and Islam," in The Experience of Islamic Art on the Margins of Islam, ed. I. A. Bierman (Reading: Ithaca Press, 2005), pp. 61-88. As Mamluk platters of this sort almost never carry religious texts, it is possible that the presence of the name of Mohammed was imputed rather than perceived, suggesting that this danger was a threat looming over the use of these imports generally. 15. A. Contadini, Fatlmid Art at the Victoria and Albert Museum (London: V and A Publications, 1998) points out that though tiraz fabrics with inscriptions could carry text on a border (see fig. 19), most, especially in the later period, tended to feature inscriptions in rows throughout the garment rather than on borders. My thanks to Elizabeth Williams for this reference. 16. My discussion of infantile babble and extra-linguistic exclamation relies primarily on D. Heller Roazen, Echolalias: On the Forgetting of Language (New York: Zone Books, 2008); N. S. Trubetskoi, Principles of Phonology (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969); R.

Hugh of St. Victor, De scripturis et escriptoribus sacris, cap. 14, PL CLXXV, col. 20: "The philosopher knew only of the meaning of the words in his books; but in the holy Scriptures the meaning of the things is much more important than that of the words, because the latter is only customary, but the former is ordered by nature. The latter is the language of man, the former that of God addressed to man. The meaning of the words is man-made, the things have their meaning from nature and by the act of God who wished some things to be meant by others. The meaning of things is also much more multiple than that of words. Because few words have more than two or three meanings, but every thing may mean as many other things, as it has visible or invisible qualities in common with other things."

Some scholars believe that the two figures striding ahead of Minerva with mouths open are not Minerva's companions but are part of the assembly of vices, fleeing together with them. See R. Lightbown, Mantegna (Oxford: Phaidon, 1986), pp. 206 and 266, note 103, and S. Campbell, The Cabinet of Eros: Renaissance Mythological Painting and the Studiolo of Isabella d'Este (New Flaven: Yale University Press, 2004), p. 147. Campbell calls the bottom two inscriptions on the scroll pseudo-Greek and pseudo-FHebrew. Lightbown (ibid., p. 202), calls the three scroll inscriptions Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, but in the attendant note (p. 266, note 86) he says that in fact the Greek letters contain a Latin inscription, without apparently recognizing the text to be the same as the one directly above. On Paride Ceresara's study of Oriental languages and his connections to the Hebrew scholars of Mantua, see Busi (note 5), pp. 99-109. For Isabella's letter asking for the Syrian letterforms pure and simple, see A. Luzio and R. Renier, La coltura e le relazioni letterarie di Isabella d'Este Gonzaga, ed. S. Albonico (Milan: Bonnard, 2006), p. 97: "Havemo gratissime le littere sacre, o siano syrie o babilonice, come scriveti, quali ... ne haveti mandate, et vi ne ringratiamo. Ma per più nostra chiareza haveremo charo che ce avisati se alcuni fogliami che hanno esse littere sono di sustantia o pur solum per adornamento, il che quando fosse vi pregamo ne mandiati un altro exemplo d'esse littere schiette et semplici, come si solevano a li soi tempi notare." 24.
