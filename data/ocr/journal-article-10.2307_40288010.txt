It was established in honour of Rhys Jones (1941-2001) to mark his enormous contribution to the development and promotion of archaeology in Australia. The Medal is presented annually to an individual who has made an outstanding and sustained contribution to the field. LIFE MEMBERSHIP FOR OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO THE AUSTRALIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION: SEAN ULM Sean became a member of AAA in 1989, his first year of study at the University of Queensland. He joined the AAA Executive in 1995 when he was an Honours student and has continued to support and assist in developing the Association ever since. Sean has made an enormous individual contribution to AAA, and his leadership has encouraged others to initiate and carry out projects that have contributed to a more successful and professional Association. His work has helped to raise the standard of AAA's profile, presentation and governance. The following are a few of the numerous specific ways in which Sean has contributed to AAA, which were included as support to his nomination: • since 1995, he has continuously held executive positions: President, Treasurer, Editor and Queensland Representative; • he was on the organising committee for AAA conferences at Gatton (1995) and Hervey Bay (2001); and session convenor or co-convenor at several conferences; as well as co-editing two volumes of conference proceedings; • as Editor, with Annie Ross, of Australian Archaeology, he was instrumental in AA being awarded an 'A* ranking in the European Reference Index for the Humanities in 2007; • he instigated production of a DVD with the first 30 years of Australian Archaeology; • he initiated the AAA Prizes and Awards scheme and was Chair of the Subcommittee in 2006 and 2007; and a Member of the Subcommittee involved in reviewing of AAA's Code of Ethics. The Life Membership for Outstanding Contribution to the Australian Archaeological Association Inc. award was established to recognise significant and sustained contribution to the objects and purposes of the Australian Archaeological Association Inc. BRUCE VEITCH AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN INDIGENOUS ENGAGEMENT: ANNIE ROSS Annie Ross is a tireless advocate for the involvement of Aboriginal communities in the management of their cultural heritage. She has pursued this agenda through community- based research projects, lectures, publications, and critical analysis of and input into the creation of legislation. For example: With the Quandamooka Aboriginal Land Council, Annie documented the Aboriginal cultural heritage of North Stradbroke and Peel Islands over eight years. Community members were involved in every step of the research process by ongoing consultation, visits to excavations, involvement in analysing midden shell in The University of Queensland laboratories, joint publications and conference presentations, and organising Aboriginal community members to participate in and contribute to AAA conferences. Brian Tobane of the Gummingurru Aboriginal Corporation says: Annie has worked with us in re-establishing Gummingurru as a place of learning. Annie has helped the traditional custodians to express and action their desire to engage with the wider community through education. Patricia O'Connor of The Yugambeh Museum Language and Heritage Research Centre said that the student visits organised by Annie enabled the Museum to engage directly with students who have the potential to become the cultural heritage managers of the future and therefore allows us to have an impact on the frameworks under which management paradigms operate within Yugambeh country. Annie has made and continues to make an invaluable contribution to Aboriginal cultural heritage practices and outcomes in Australia. The Bruce Veitch Award for Excellence in Indigenous Engagement was created to celebrate Bruce's important contribution to the practice and ethics of archaeology in Australia. It is awarded annually to an individual or group who has undertaken an archaeological or cultural heritage project which has produced a significant outcome for Indigenous interests.

Rather than a bald account of sites and dates, it grapples with the evidence and puts each problem into a coherent, well-argued framework, thus making the book a scholarly, scientific introduction for students and ensuring it will become a starting point for other scholars. Writing from an archaeological perspective, Hiscock argues strongly and cogently, for the need to deal with the archaeological data as free- standing, and the long durée as the basic structure, suitable for the dating methods and accumulative and taphonomic process of most of the Australian record. He doesn't dismiss ethnography, but recognises its limitations. Stemming from the foregoing, is that Australian history becomes a story of continuous dynamic change and adaptation. Hiscock's study really shines in the way he views the archaeological record as one which must be seen as partial and incomplete and it is only in understanding the nature of that partiality and incompleteness that we can see beyond it into history. Quellenforschung, the historians call it, source criticism, and it has rarely been better done in archaeology. Through this book we can see where we stand on solid ground, and where the known unknowns lie. The John Mulvaney Book Award was established in honour of John Mulvaney and his contribution and commitment to Australian archaeology over a lifetime of professional service. It was created to acknowledge the significant contribution of individual or co-authored publications to Australian archaeology, either as general knowledge or as specialist publications. CONFERENCE PAPER PRIZES (Judging Committee: Jane Balme, Heather Burke, Andrew Fairbairn, Ines Domingo Sanz, Matthew Spriggs, Amy Tabrett) Best Overall Paper Prize (Sponsored by AAA) The Multiplicity of Uses of Australian Backed Artefacts Gail Robertson, Val Attenbrow and Peter Hiscock Australian backed artefacts have been employed by archaeologists to demonstrate culture change in many studies. We know they appeared in the north Queensland archaeological record in the late Pleistocene, were intensively produced in southeastern Australia from about 3500 BP to 1500 BP, and had seemingly disappeared by the time of British colonisation. As there are no ethnographic observations of backed artefact use many speculations about their purpose have reflected expectations that prehistoric use of backed artefacts in Australia would be similar to uses inferred for microliths elsewhere in the world or the ethnographic use of other stone artefacts in composite tools. In this paper we present results of a new integrated residue and use- wear analysis, employing both low and high magnification, which studied large samples of backed artefacts from three excavated rockshelters in Upper Mangrove Creek on the New South Wales central coast. Our results emphasise the multifunctional and multipurpose nature of this category of tool. In addition, a high level of intersite variation was found in backed artefact use, even within this small region. These findings remind us that we cannot expect investigations of any single specimen or site to characterise the nature of this tool's complex use.

Sarah Croker, Warren Reed and Denise Donlan Fragments of bone are notoriously difficult to identify, yet the separation of human from non-human bone is an important task. Occasional sources of literature mention that cortical bone thickness may be a distinguishing factor between human and non-human bone. But details are frustratingly scarce. And does this hold true for Australian conditions? This study used the tibia as a test bone, as it is a large weight-bearing bone in all the sample taxa (human, sheep, kangaroo, dog, pig and cattle). Radiography was used to visualise the internal dimensions of the tibiae. Measurements were taken of shaft width, medulla width and cortical bone thickness and at the midshaft. The results showed that human tibiae were not clearly distinguishable from all studied non-human taxa. The cortex of the human tibia varies according to which side is under consideration. Accordingly, the large anterior ridge of the human tibia resulted in its grouping with thicker-boned animals (pigs and cattle). The thinner posterior, medial and lateral sides of the bone were also similar to pigs, but to kangaroos as well, and, to a lesser extent, sheep and dogs. When identifying bones, no single criteria should be depended upon; and there is certainly much scope for further work here. This study does show, however, that suggestions of a useful distinction between human and non-human cortical bone thickness appear to be misleading.

Issues Concerning the Identification of Flaked Stone Artefacts in a Material-Rich Context Oliver Macgregor, Alex Mackay, Phil Hughes and Marjorie Sullivan Recent surveys in the Pilbara region of northwestern Australia highlighted difficulties in the identification of anthropogenic flaked stones. The study area is rich in silicious rock and subject to a range of seasonal and aseasonal processes which regularly induce percussive and thermal fracture. The result is a ground surface littered with rocks which effectively mimic flaked stone artefacts. The potential for over-estimates of artefact densities in the area is thus considerable. In this paper we describe several of the processes responsible for production of these mimics, and the characteristics which allow them to be distinguished from anthropogenically modified rocks. That some ambiguity persists in spite of these distinctions underlines the need for close attention to detail and for the use of explicit criteria in the identification of artefacts. University of Waikato Radiocarbon Dating Prize (Sponsored by the University of Waikato Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory) Patterns of Prédation: Human Exploitation of Anadara granosa; Blue Mud Bay, North Australia Pat Faulkner In addressing questions revolving around the formation of the large, Anadara gra/tosa-dominated shell mounds of northern Australia, most analyses have been based on the implicit assumption of continuity in patterns and intensity of human exploitation. Using archaeological, biological, ecological and environmental data, this paper provides an alternative explanation highlighting differences in human behaviour between the recent past and the period of mound formation. CONFERENCE POSTER PRIZES (Judging Committee: Brit Asmussen, Alice Gorman, Oliver Macgregor, Ken Mulvaney, Anthony Simmons) Best Overall Poster Prize (Sponsored by AAA) Analysis of the Watinglo Plant Macrofossil Assemblage, Northern Lowlands, Papua New Guinea Joann Bowman Much debate has surrounded questions of the timing, nature and origins of the development of food production practices, including the use of tree species, in Near Oceania. The extent of the influence that migrating Austronesian speakers had on this process has received particular attention and current debate is divided on the issue. Theories range from those suggesting that the development of tree species exploitation practices, including arboriculture, were developed completely independently in Near Oceania to those suggesting that Austronesian speakers introduced the use of many species and subsistence practices to a Near Oceanic population that did not previously utilise them. The northern coastline of Papua New Guinea has been identified as an area of significant interest in this debate; however, the region has been largely overlooked in past research. This region is potentially of great importance to our understandings of Papuan- Austronesian interactions as the likely region through which Austronesian-speaking groups moved into Near Oceania. We seek to begin to rectify this imbalance through an analysis of tree species exploitation throughout the Holocene at Watinglo, a site in the northern lowlands of Papua New Guinea. A time- sensitive quantitative analysis of the Watinglo plant macrofossil assemblage was undertaken to identify changes in the intensity and diversity of economic tree species exploited that may indicate changes in subsistence practices. Best Student Poster Prize (Sponsored by AAA) The Chosen Ones: A Morphological and Technological Approach to Understanding Manufacture and Selection of Lei I ira Clair Harris Archaeological and ethnographical discussions of leilira production in northern Australia demonstrate that a wide variety of techniques were utilised in different geographic regions to produce relatively similar forms. This thesis uses a combination of technological analysis, three dimensional geometric morphometric analyses and an index of symmetry to evaluate the regional variability of techniques used to manufacture leilira. This combination of techniques has received little or no attention in Australian lithic studies although results indicate that robust conclusions can be drawn from their application. Results indicate that regional traditions in manufacture were distinct from one another; however, the selection criteria applied when choosing leilira from manufacturing locations was more standardised due to their value as a trade item. The results from this research have wide-ranging implications for issues such as craft specialisation and the economies of people in northern Australia prior to and concurrent with the contact era. Runner-up Student Poster Prize (Sponsored by AAA) The Art Items of Wadi Hammeh 27: Interactions and Individual Expression Janine Major The growing interest in exploring the role that symbols and images may have had in forming social and economic relationships within and amongst communities of the Epipalaeolithic and early Neolithic of the Levant underpins my research. During the Epipalaeolithic, and particularly within the Natufian period (c.13,000 to 10,200 BP), the Levant experienced a blossoming of art that is impressive in relation to its relative sudden appearance, its high degree of technical mastery as well as its application to Number 68, June 2009 aUStralian ARCHAEOLOGY 95</page><page sequence="4">Backfill otherwise functional artefacts. Wadi Hammeh 27, located in the Jordan Valley, has yielded one of the most extensive and well provenanced corpuses of decorated items, particularly from an open-air Early Natufian settlement. The assemblage therefore provides an opportunity to study these artistic expressions from both a technological and contextual point of view. The art assemblage from Wadi Hammeh 27 includes anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and geometric motifs which appear on bone and stone items such as figurines, pendants, sickle hafts, ground stone equipment, plaques and architectural elements. Francesco d'Errico's development of microscopic analyses provides the methodological framework for the technological analysis of the Wadi Hammeh 27 assemblage. This paper discusses relationships between manufacturing techniques, raw material and motifs within the art assemblage from Wadi Hammeh 27. The study provides insights into aspects of interaction between the occupants of this site and other Natufian sites as well as notions of individual expression at Wadi Hammeh 27.
