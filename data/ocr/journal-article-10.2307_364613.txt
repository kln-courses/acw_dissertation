<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER AND THE PROBLEM OF PROGRESS BRUCE CURTIS AMONG the crosscurrents of late-nineteenth-century Ameri- can thought, belief in inevitable human progress, under- stood as "irreversible meliorative change," was especially per- vasive.1 Influenced by the apparently limitless resources of their new land, the cosmic optimism of such European think- ers as Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer, the seemingly progressive implications of Charles Darwin's theory-and even sometimes by the promises of Karl Marx-a broad cross sec- tion of Americans came to expect a bright human prospect. Few Americans, even among intellectuals, spoke strongly against the dominant mood. Henry Adams was, of course, the major exception. Another scholar who arrived independently at the less popular view was William Graham Sumner, Yale sociologist and author of Folkways. Sumner (1840-191o) is often mentioned in discussions of the late-nineteenth century, but few scholars have examined his ideas in detail and none has attempted an integrated discus- sion of his thought. Consequently, students of his era are most familiar with partial portraits of Sumner as a conservative social Darwinist, as a hardheaded laissez-faire empiricist who scoffed at softhearted reformers and vague theorizers.

Sumner's editor and successor at Yale, Albert Gal- loway Keller, contributed to the common view by stressing, in his reminiscences and editing, Sumner's respect for empiri- cism and scorn for free-floating theories that lacked the anchor of fact.2 More recently, and directly relevant to Sumner's con- cern with progress, David Marcell has asserted that Sumner, a "formalist," was a firm believer in progress. Yet by definition, formalistic concep- tions of progress gave little or no efficacy to human will as an agent of historical improvement. Whereas Sumner believed in progress as the necessary concomitant of evolution, he regarded the de- liberate, conscious manipulation of social arrangements as con- trary to the laws controlling both. Progress derived in Sumner's view from absolute, natural laws of competition that admitted no interference by individuals; if the competition prescribed by na- ture as the dynamic of change was unimpeded, progress would slowly, inexorably ensue.3 There is truth in these views, but it is incomplete. Extended analysis of Sumner's understanding of progress reveals that his ideas were both more complex and less consistent than has been recognized, and that the mysteries of the subject drew him beyond narrow empiricism to intense speculation about the nature of human beings and the cosmos in which they lived. It could hardly have been otherwise, for the circumstances of Sumner's age required all thoughtful men to consider an interrelated series of problems. Furthermore, the particular circumstances of Sumner's life directed him to the same con- cerns. Coming to intellectual maturity in the mid-nineteenth century, Sumner immediately became involved in the contro- versy between religion and science as an advocate of a com- promise position. But he was soon convinced in the mid-187o's 2See, Reminiscences (Mainly Personal) of William Graham Sumner (New Haven, 1933), 17-18, 29-32. 3 Progress and Pragmatism: James, Dewey, Beard, and the American Idea of Progress (Westport, Conn., 1974), 47-48.</page><page sequence="3">350 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY of the truth of Darwin's theory of evolution, and thenceforth attempted to develop a consistent naturalistic world view. Moreover, as a leading founder of academic social science in America, Sumner addressed the major problems and promises of a democratic society being rapidly transformed by the in- dustrial revolution. His quest for answers led him to consider especially the relative value for society of competition and cooperation, the meaning of Thomas Malthus's population theories, and the significance of the Second Law of Thermo- dynamics. Sumner, then, spent a lifetime examining the im- plications of new social and intellectual developments for the welfare of Americans particularly and of mankind generally. Preeminent among his concerns was the degree to which human volition was circumscribed by economic, social, and cosmic forces, and the degree to which freedom obtained. Sumner's attempts to reconcile determinism and free will were inextricably related to his concern with progress. There is a sense in which all of Sumner's interests came to focus on the question of the causes, direction, and meaning of human progress, or whether, indeed, there was ultimately any significant progress at all. Especially in his earlier years as a clergyman and later as a convert to evolution and naturalism in the 187o's and 188o's, Sumner was not entirely immune to the modern drive for unending material and moral improve- ment. And he believed always that, compared to past eras, his was a progressive, enlightened age "from the height of which we look back upon the life of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with a shudder."4 Yet he came increasingly to doubt the wisdom of unquestioning adherence to the modern faith in progress and to seek its deeper meanings and ironies. Sum- ner was never able, whether as a clergyman or naturalist, to believe that unaided mankind could approach perfection. Ironically, however, the Natural Law that replaced his be- nevolent God came to be seen as, if not malevolent, at least 4 The Forgotten Man and Other Essays, Albert Galloway Keller, Editor (New Haven, 1919), 366; War and Other Essays, Albert Galloway Keller, Editor (New Haven, 1911), 26-27.</page><page sequence="4">WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER 351 coldly indifferent to men. Perhaps the sharpest irony, for Sumner, was that such progress as human volition could pro- duce would finally be negated, if not by frail and perverse man himself, then surely by impersonal cosmic forces that directed the great cycles of the universe. On balance, and despite wa- verings, Sumner came to reject belief in endless, inevitable progress in favor of a pessimistic view of life that stressed the importance of human choice, when choice was possible, but of endurance and duty when it was not. Influenced by his un- derstanding of Malthusian theory and the Second Law of Thermodynamics, by belief in the innate limitations of hu- man nature, and perhaps by personal experience and tempera- ment, Sumner came to express the minority view in late-nine- teenth-century America, although in less well developed form than Henry Adams, that social decline and physical entropy threatened mankind. Sumner's early intellectual life, however, more nearly re- flected the popular optimism of his age. As a Yale student from 1859 to 1863, Sumner was taught that God and man were in- separably joined, that in his essence man was above the laws of nature, that a "lapse of all mankind" from the progress of civilization and Christianity was "impossible." He learned al- so that "In the heavenly bodies we see the spirit of God act- ing." As the English theologian William Paley had shown, design in nature proved a Designer.5 A few years later, as a young Episcopal clergyman, Sumner's view of human progress was virtually indistinguishable from his hope that God's earthly reign would be established. Foreshadowing his later ac- ceptance of evolutionary theory, he told parishioners in 1871 that "God's plan in this world is one of growth, development, and progress."6 Sumner's religious faith in Providential design is important 5 "History" [college class notes], Sept., 1862, lectures i and 2; Untitled [col- lege class note], n.d., n.p.; "T[heodore] Dwight's Lecture on Christian Evidences and Natural Theology," n.d., n.p.

To Sumner, Chris- tian faith, informed by reason and conscience, revealed God's design in history. Christ had disclosed God's plan that all man- kind be redeemed. Sumner preached the idea, whose origins were in apocalyptic Christian millennialism and the Book of Revelation, of the "Kingdom of God" on earth. But, as Sum- ner exemplified, in respectable nineteenth-century American religious circles, millennialism had been considerably domes- ticated: It comes without noise or tumult, it springs in the heart of a man, in the midst of a society, and is visible only in its fruits. Wherever living fruitful faith is, wherever a sense of duty holds sway, wher- ever the cross of faith and duty is eagerly seized and faithfully carried, wherever sin is hated, and ignorance is banished, there is the kingdom of God.7 Men could seek a cooperative, just, humane, Christian so- ciety, but its ultimate fulfillment depended on God's redemp- tive plan. Proud men sought their own ends, but they were finally God's instruments. Sumner told his parishioners: We wonder if there is any consistent thread through human his- tory, but above all is God, who sees and orders all and works out His patient unrelenting plan with these conflicting, ambitious, sordid aims, and perverse acts of men.8 As the Reformation or the Franco-Prussian War showed, most men were unwitting chips on the current of Providential pur- pose: "Do you suppose that men who have to bear a prominent part in such movements.., .ever fully understand what they are doing? Hardly ever.

Sumner believed that men marched only haltingly up the path of spiritual and moral progress because of human dis- abilities, and because Providence used the world to test and "discipline" men. Progress entailed continual struggle, delays, disappointments, reversals, but knowledge of the design that foreshadowed and directed history gave believers certainty as to its end. Although as a pastor, Sumner stressed human frailty and sinfulness, he also held that "it is familiar to human ex- perience that men are capable of unlimited improvement. The divine germ may lie buried so deeply under the soil of earth that it threatens to perish there but care and nurture can make it spring and grow and bear fruit."'x A dialectical process of struggle led inevitably toward the ultimate harmony of the Kingdom of God on earth." Armed with assurance of ultimate-even if far-removed per- fectibility-men could fight to establish a latter-day version of the millennium, the Kingdom of God in America. In that struggle Providence required men to overcome the tempta- tions of both adversity and prosperity. Thus war and peace, despair and elation, work and ease, all had disciplinary uses. But, especially for Sumner, work. For work, properly under- stood, was worship. Men were generally responsible for im- plementing God's grand design, but they were crucially re- sponsible for their own well-being. Sumner told his fianc6e, "As for trust in God, my love... if you were to sit down and trust in God for your dinner you would not probably get it and you would do a very wicked thing. We ought to adopt the means He has put in our power to work for what we need."2 In a life of struggle to avoid sin and achieve the Chris- tian commonwealth, devotion to duty and disciplined, honest work in a particular calling were divinely sanctioned; sloth, 10 Sermon no. 82, June 3, 1871. 11 "The Living Church," Living Church, May, 1869, 3. 12 Letter to Jeannie Elliott, June io, 1870.</page><page sequence="7">354 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY extravagance, intemperance, casual trust that all would be well, these too would be justly rewarded. Sumner always argued that social progress was necessarily an individual mat- ter, and that "Labor and self-denial are the only forces by which society advances."'3 In conceiving that men could choose to further Providential design by working to build God's Kingdom, Sumner reconciled the apparent opposition of determinism and free will. He believed, that is, that men could cooperate with Providential design to produce harmony from the clashing forces of the world. Much the same pattern appeared in Sumner's naturalistic view of "antagonistic cooperation." By that term Sumner meant "the combination of two persons or groups to satisfy a great common interest while minor antagonisms of interest which exist between them are suppressed."'4 That conception revealed his belief that the natural laws of human nature, in- teracting in a dialectical process of struggle with environ- mental forces, tended to produce harmony. As a young man, Sumner had learned not only that Provi- dence ensured human progress, but that men in society ad- vanced through four stages-barbaric, hunting, pastoral, and agricultural-toward successively higher levels of civilization. He always subscribed, although sometimes with qualifications, to the common nineteenth-century conception of stages of civilization. In his middle and later years following the mid- 187o's, converted from orthodox Christianity to Darwin's evolutionary theory and a naturalistic world view, he came to believe that over millennia both instinct and intelligence had led men to antagonistic cooperation as the best method by which to achieve their purpose of surviving and living in the struggle for existence. The rise of the primitive family was a prime example. Each man's egoistic interests were best realized in antagonistic cooperation with others against the 18 "The Strikes," [c. 188o], 6-7; Forgotten Man, 427. 14 Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals (1go6; rpt.

Sumner's conception of antagonistic cooperation depended upon his understanding of evolutionary theory as an endless dialectical round of antagonisms and harmonies. Conceiving of evolution as universal, and influenced by Spencer, Sumner went beyond biology to physics in seeking to understand its meaning. As a naturalist and materialist, Sumner believed that, so far as men knew, the interactions of force and matter alone moved the universe. Since they obeyed the "Law of the Composition of Forces," the "great law of the universe," which neatly linked motion, evolution, and "harmony," the laws and forces of social evolution could at least theoretically be un- derstood with mathematical exactitude."6 The Law of the Composition of Forces indicated that all motion, organic or inorganic, resulted from stresses produced by forces in dis- equilibrium. Thus, any system moved constantly from homo- geneity toward heterogeneity, but in a continually oscillating or rhythmic pattern because of the pressure of opposing forces, so that a type of dynamic or working harmony ensued: Why should it seem strange that harmonies and antagonisms co- exist when mathematics teach us that harmonies and rhythms arise from composition of antagonistic forces and that varieties of harmony are produced by the number of components and the varieties of their relative duration and ratio to each other.17 Clearly the Law of the Composition of Forces indicated that all motion formed an alternating pattern created by "inter- twining" antagonisms and harmonies, and that universal phenomena alternated between "concentration and diffu- sion." The entire universe, then, existed in a state of flux that 15 War, 8-9, 176; Folkways, 16, 164; "The Application of the Notions of Evolution and Progress on the Superorganic Domain," 19o5, 3-4- 16 Note in file drawer ig, n.d.

The understanding that all things moved dialectically and end- lessly from antagonisms to harmonies to antagonisms was per- vasive in Sumner's evolutionary world view.s8 Sumner's conception of the universal cycle's tendency was not entirely consistent because he alternated between em- phasizing that it was ultimately static and yet believed that it was to some extent progressive. In society, for example, the cycle of intertwining antagonisms and harmonies derived from alternating conflicts and compromises that individuals and groups experienced while interacting. Typically, men learned to subordinate conflicts in order to establish harmony of interests and thus create a more highly developed and bal- anced "social organism." In this dialectical process, antago- nisms reappeared on successively higher planes, only to be superseded by new and fruitful harmonies, apparently ad infinitum. Sumner was at least equally aware of examples of "retrogres- sion" in biological evolution and in the history of decayed and fallen civilizations, but it was clear to him that mankind had gradually and painfully advanced through the four stages of civilization. He occasionally recognized that stages were only convenient markers and that social evolution followed no de- termined order. He once wrote, "What we commonly boast of as progress consists in measuring the situation at one time by the notions of another.... Whether the historical movement by which society has moved from the life of the Indians to that of the cotton operatives has been progress or degenera- tion, depends on whether it is viewed from the standpoint of the Indian or the white man."19 But Sumner more commonly echoed his age and culture, as when he informed students that "The Half-civilized type is best represented in Southeastern Asia. The civilized is represented by our western civiliza- 18 Note in file drawer 9, n.d.; "Progress," [c. igoo], n.p. 19 Earth-Hunger and Other Essays, Albert Galloway Keller, Editor (New Haven, 1913), 146.</page><page sequence="10">WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER 357 tion."20 Upon the four levels of civilization, Sumner super- imposed the more inclusive stages of "militarism" and "in- dustrialism" that Spencer also employed. In the modern era the most fruitful form of antagonistic cooperation had come to be industrialism, virtually a synonym for free-enterprise capitalism, which had gradually prevailed over militaristic tendencies in civilization. In economic terms Sumner's vision of progressive society was of a capitalistic system that encouraged lawful competi- tion and free trade among all men and nations. Social conflict and war, both internal and external, had impeded the growth of an expanded antagonistic cooperation that potentially in- cluded all men in a world peace group, but despite long-con- tinued conflict, that higher, more sophisticated and harmo- nious cooperation was gradually developing. In 1879, for example, Sumner believed with other free traders of his era that, "The tendency is towards an industrial system controlled by a natural cooperation far grander than anybody has ever planned, towards a community of interests and welfare ... and towards a free and peaceful rivalry amongst nations in the arts of civilization."21 In such conditions, he wrote a decade later, "Nationalism becomes an impertinence."22 Sumner con- sistently emphasized the advantages of peaceful industrialism over militarism, of the world as a peace group bonded by free commerce, rather than sundered by mercantilist and protec- tionist national self-interest. Although he may have been a "social Darwinist" in some respects, as an advocate of inter- national antagonistic cooperation Sumner consistently em- phasized cooperation more than antagonism. For Sumner, progressive capitalistic civilization was built upon the great modern discoveries, especially of the New World, and the scientific methods and technological innova- tions of the modern era.

America, especially, because its small population could ex- ploit vast resources, had become a powerful democracy, clearly superior to a Europe still suffering from vestiges of militarism and royal despotism, and even more certainly su- perior to lower societies elsewhere. Although generally a severe critic of democratic America, insofar as it promoted deadening absolute equality, Sumner nevertheless viewed his country as the acme of political progress. Great new inventions had buttressed the democracy that had resulted from a favorable man-land ratio. The steamboat, Sumner told students, had touched America like a "magic wand."28 Sumner emphasized the urgent necessity and sig- nificant rewards of industrial development: From the increase of industrial power there follows advance in science, fine arts, literature, and education, which react again on the social power to stimulate it and accelerate the rate of its ac- tivity, thus increasing its efficiency.24 Despite this unusually sanguine analysis, Sumner's Mal- thusianism ensured that his long-term expectations for ma- chine culture would be quite modest, and that his view of the future of American democracy would be pessimistic. As a nat- uralist and evolutionist he believed that Darwin had incor- porated political economy's conception of division of labor and had broadened the "narrower" doctrine of Malthus, which held that population always tended to outrun food supply.25 When Sumner presented his views of Malthus' theories, the economic determinism so important to his naturalistic thought was especially evident. He believed consistently that Malthus had expressed natural law and that "It is this ratio of population to land which determines what are the possibilities 28 Lectures on "History of Finance, Politics, and Political Economy in the United States," transcribed by Raymond S.

But men must realize that prevailing conditions of "prog- ress and modern enlightenment and democracy and the happi- ness of the masses" were dependent on the low ratio of men to available land.29 As Malthus had discerned and Darwin had substantiated, overpopulation was the normal human state in which struggle, distress, and starvation were normal. The logic of evolutionary theory, especially Malthus' contribution, posited incessantly alternating social change and imposed the conclusion that mankind would once again suffer from harsh conditions."0 Improvements in the "practical arts," which had been forced by population pressure, and which had brought good times, would allow men once more to breed prolifically: "We find ourselves squirming in the grasp of forces which through all changes remain equally undiminished."3' The contest between civilization and population would con- 26 Earth-Hunger, 31. 27 War, 159- 28 Earth-Hunger, 162; "The Strikes," [c. 188o], 43- 29 Lectures on "History of Finance, Politics, and Political Economy in the United States," transcribed by Raymond S.

And there were stages of civilization. But even the highest stage lacked guarantees. Indeed, if any prob- ability could be suggested, it was the decline of civilization. When present favorable conditions changed, democracy would pass away and aristocracy would reassert its sway: "There are no dogmatic propositions of political philosophy which are universally and always true; there are views which prevail, at a time, for a while, and then fade away and give place to other views."33 Even at his most optimistic, Sumner believed human prog- ress was slow and erratic, but his stress on the suffering men must endure to survive, and perhaps to advance, increased dramatically as he came to be influenced by social analogues of Darwin's theory. Another consequence was that he became in- creasingly sophisticated in making distinctions among kinds of progress. His matured analysis in his later years focused on three areas: the arts, human nature, and universal or cosmic processes. Sumner held that historically progress in the fine arts had been negligible or nonexistent but that in the practical arts it had been clear and irrefutable. As an economic determinist, he defined progress as increased power over nature that the great modern inventions and discoveries had offered men. Machines, capital formation, more efficient business methods, and the resources of the New World had put men ahead, if only temporarily, in the grim game of survival. At this level progress meant improved ability to adjust to the ever-chang- ing conditions of existence. Chance had certainly entered, but progress in the practical arts had depended primarily on the patient endeavors of men. Mankind had advanced as intelli- gence had guided and antagonistic cooperation had helped to satisfy the pervasive human urge to self-aggrandizement and 32 War, 176. 8833 War, 162; Folkways, 376.</page><page sequence="14">WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER 361 self-realization. Specifically, a crucial series of individuals, mankind's elite, had by hard work, creative vision, and the scientific method led men to their present temporary position of ease. Modern society, with its natural, rhythmic alternation between individualistic competition and socially oriented an- tagonistic cooperation, represented the emergence of indus- trialism out of ages of militarism. As the peace group had been gradually extended from family, to clan, to nation, and be- yond, mankind had moved upward, at differential ratios, of course, through the stages of civilization.34 And yet, as Sumner read history he discerned a striking pat- tern in the life of nations and societies of growth to maturity and glory followed by decline, decay, and death. This wasteful process "has been the history of civilization and it certainly is not a very optimistic fact."35 At times a natural cycle seemed at work, but at others human ills seemed caused directly by human weaknesses. In discussing progress, Sumner was most ambivalent when examining human nature. He sometimes discovered extremely slight, but permanent improvements in the mental and moral characteristics of human nature from the savage to the civi- lized man. Yet, like the literary naturalists of his day, he in- sisted at least as often that the "brute" in man "may awake again at any time."38 Sumner's interest in man's atavistic ten- dencies is suggested by his library, which contained a baker's dozen of Emile Zola's novels. Sumner's most optimistic view was that all human progress, especially improvements in human nature, had been painful, slow, and dependent on chance as well as intelligent purpose. All human progress was highly tenuous, subject to human weakness and miscalculation and ubiquitous misfortune. At best, progress could be graphically illustrated, not by a simple unilinear curve, but by vast cycles, or perhaps spirals, that 84 Folkways, 604; Challenge of Facts, 147-150; War, 241. 85 Lectures on "Science of Society," transcribed by A.

The men whose philosophy is now in the ascendant will reply that there is, but their assertion will not bear the test of facts. If you are a democrat in your faiths and tastes, if you love humanitarianism and altruism, if you care nothing for religion, if you love technical skill, if you are critical and realistic, you will scorn feudalism, medieval theology, and the fantastic notions of Aquinas and Scotus. It will seem to you that the world has gained very much, precisely in ethical tone. If, on the other hand, you try to measure up the gain of today relatively to classical times, medieval times, the renaissance, etc. you will join those who say that, if there is any progress, it is won on a spiral line. We are like men on one side of a great spiral circle who see that they are going in an exactly opposite direction to those on the opposite side of the same circle, when, in fact, they are going in the same direction after all.38 Even so, at his most pessimistic, Sumner believed history showed only "waves" in the evolution of human nature and society. Men who now rode the wave at a crest ignored the inevitable trough ahead. In 1905 he spoke to the Yale An- thropology Club on evolution and society. Defining progress as "an inherent stress, strain, or push in the system of nature toward what men like and approve," he denied that social evolution was progressive. History, having replaced for Sum- ner the theology of Providential design, showed "no perma- nent tendency" and was "enthused by no spirit at all." Sumner was a pioneer in establishing the concept of folkways and mores in sociology and in insisting that social customs were 87 Lectures on "Social Science," transcribed by Albert Galloway Keller, Nov. 25, 1896; Lectures on "Science and Society," transcribed by A.

In his speech to the Anthropology Club he asserted, I deny that there is an inherent tendency in mores to become more refined, or in philosophy and ethics toward more exact relation to absolute truth and right, or in institutions towards truth and justice and wider beneficence. That all depends on the conjunc- ture. I shall try to show that the societal system, the philosophy, the mores, and the ethics, all conform to the status produced by the conjuncture. The conjuncture, however, is capable of infinite variation, so that it produces a rolling, tossing, swaying, and end- less dissolution of successive forms and stages in the sequences of all superorganic forms. That is what history shows us.39 Elsewhere Sumner wrote that "The folkways seem to me like a great and restless sea of clouds."40 At the turn of the century period, Sumner attempted in an essay that developed the metaphor of glacial movements to communicate the magnitude and drama of cosmic changes in their impact on puny man.41 He took considerable pains with it, and, although never published, it was one of his better written pieces. The objective tone veiled only lightly an emo- tional appeal as he departed from his usually straightforward style to evoke graphic images-the glacier is like a great dragon, men live and die like soldiers fleeing across a bullet- swept field. Sumner invited the reader to imagine sitting above a Swiss mountain valley that an ancient glacier, now receded to the valley's head, had ground out. The valley, green and fertile, is the home of a happy human community. The "teleologist" declares that the glaciation process was progressive in prepar- ing a place for man. But he forgets that the glacier may ad- vance again. He ignores the fact of cosmic flux: "We are left face to face with the great cosmical forces in their everlasting ebb and flow, combination and collision."

In a drama of forces in "heaving and tossing interaction," The men come and go with their interests, hopes, ambitions, pains, toil and suffering, each one bounded by a lifetime within which it seems that all past history was only preparing for it, all present in- stitutions exist to favor it, and all the future depends upon it. The hopes, ambitions and happiness of a man are all selected inde- pendently of the seething and tossing of the social forces.... In a true scientific view of the matter, a phase of social organization which has lasted long enough to be defined and described like the Assyro-Babylonian, the Classical, the Medieval, the Modern, is only a phase in the everlasting change from what was to what shall be and that change is not polarized between any points of de- parture and attainment which can be defined or between which any line of rational tendency can be drawn. Sumner's naturalistic view of man's quixotic dream of endur- ing progress in a universe of blind and clashing forces was never better expressed. As in his essay on the glacier, when he considered cosmic evolution elsewhere, his images were of great cycles or the limitless undulating waves of a sea of time and change. Sumner once wrote that "at the outermost horizon of our knowledge we try to frame a view of the material universe which shall be true.... The view consists of inferences but they are contradictory and we cannot make them into a whole."42 Nevertheless, he consistently sought to see things whole through the insights evolution offered. But in the uni- versal evolutionary process, Sumner found no beneficent force, as he had earlier in Providential design, intent on shaping the cosmos to suit man's ends. Quite the contrary. Less elaborately and explicitly than Henry Adams, but unlike most Ameri- cans of his day, Sumner came to face the implications of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which taught him that the universe moved toward complete homogeneity, toward en- 42 Note in file drawer 18, n.d.</page><page sequence="18">WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER 365 tropy. And he came to believe that evolution at any level re- quired decay and dissolution as well as "progress." In a turn- of-the-century manuscript on the subject, he used the favored image of a glacier's ebb and flow and then asserted, The case shows us the construction which we ought to put on man's whole relation to the earth and of the period within which he can enjoy it between the time when it was not possible to live here and the coming time when it will not be possible for him to live here. All the "changes" are but the successive phases of the movement from one of these states to the other. Where does the idea of progress come in?... The outcome of the whole universe may be, so far as we can find out, another nebulous mass like the one from which, so far as we can find out, it came.... The whole existence of the earth presents itself as a wave which begins at a zero line, moves through a maximum and returns to the zero line. It is, however, interrupted by minor wave motions of rise and fall and the view of men, even if it includes all history, encompasses but the minor fluctuations on a certain extent of the great wave of earth existence.... Even then it will perhaps all recommence and run the same course again. Whether another cosmic cycle would produce another version of humankind to run the same race again Sumner did not say, but his implication seemed obvious. Progress, he continued, is like a man who has lain for a long time on a rock. He turns and feels much better. That is progress. But soon the pain be- gins again.43 Elsewhere Sumner wrote more specifically of his vision of an eternally cyclical history: The globe grows old and wears out. The men on it ran their course as a race. They can add nothing to the globe. They are daily using it up. It may be reduced to a cinder which can no longer support life. The human beings all die and the story is closed, with no one 48 "Progress," [c. 9goo], n.p. Adams seems not to have influenced Sumner's ideas about progress, although on Aug. 15, 1875, he wrote to Sumner about de- voting an issue of the North American Review to "discussing the progress, or perhaps rather the movement, of America in Religion, Politics, Literature, Law, Science and Economy. I omit art for a very simple reason which Pontoppidan discovered first in regard to snakes in Norway, I believe."</page><page sequence="19">366 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY left to read it. What does all the progress mean then?... If the globe is turned into a cinder it may go through some center of heat, somewhere in space, and be all raised to a gas again, and then once more go through life and history. That is the same as to say that this globe of ours may have gone through such a re- juvenation over and over again already. So that, if we use all our knowledge as a basis of speculation, we find that we are shut in by an horizon which we may put at any imaginable distance, and our notion of progress will be found to mean nothing but the passage of time with which our existence is interlocked. In this view we get a notion of how much our better and worse in the judgment of the history of centuries is worth."4 Although Sumner began his ministerial career with the hope that men would further Providential design by establish- ing God's Kingdom, he came to a naturalistic sense of the hu- man struggle for survival in an indifferent universe. Even as early as the latter stages of his religious phase, he had realized that men were alone on their world island, "shut out from the inhabitants, if there be any, of any other planet... shut up to a common lot and a common destiny."45' For Sumner, man's lonely struggle would end only when an altered "conjunc- ture" at some point in the endless reaches of time eliminated the play of human force. The human destiny, he wrote, "is a zero undoubtedly."46 Both as minister and naturalist, Sumner viewed mankind's fate as virtually determined by cosmic forces. He did not, however, advocate a fatalistic or quietistic phi- losophy. "If a man is twenty-five years of age," Sumner asked in his later years, "why does he go on to become thirty?" He goes on to thirty because he is alive and with the progress of time he must go through his span of earthly existence. The only alternative is suicide. The world goes on for the same reason. Existence means that with time phases of successive change must be traversed without end. From the end or purpose or from the 44 Untitled [Societal Evolution], [c. 1905], 6o. 45 "The Solidarity of the Human Race," 1873, n.p. 46 Untitled [Definition of Societology], [c. 1895], 21.</page><page sequence="20">WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER 367 process of this evolution no deduction as to man's duty can be made except possibly not to commit suicide.47 Instead of the "vain anthropomorphism"48 of progress, or equally vain despair, Sumner offered men the alternative of stoical acceptance of one's duty and of the human condition in an uncaring universe. Sumner stressed repeatedly that "The evolution philosophy has won dominion over the thinking of our age.... If this view is correct, the moral sense of human existence must lie in it and ethical relations must be deduced from it."'9 Yet, in finding that, so far as men could tell, there was nothing ethical or teleological in the evolutionary process, he was thrown back on the resources of men to make their own meaning for ex- istence. An existentialist perception of man as living for a moment within some great cycle of the universe, without ex- ternal support or direction, cast upon his own intellectual and moral resources, driven to seek his own duty and destiny, was fundamental to Sumner's naturalistic world view. In time Sumner concluded, perhaps with a certain grim fascination, that man, subject to atavism, social decay, and the inconceiv- ably vast gas-to-gas cycle of cosmic flux, was left alone in the universe to direct his own destiny to the limited extent possi- ble. And, where he could not, to find meaning in his existence by stoically seeking to understand the natural forces and laws that would overwhelm him. William Graham Sumner lived in a nineteenth-century world that, shortly before twentieth-century social cataclysms questioned the efficacy of progress, found it possible to hope for unending improvement. He was attracted for a time to modern conceptions of progress that were early encouraged by his faith in Providential design, and later by his naturalistic faith that mankind's elite brought advances by expressing reason through scientific method. As a naturalist Sumner found that under the leadership of the best minds, and 47 "Progress," [c. 1900oo], n.p. 48 Earth-Hunger, 31. 49 "Progress," [c. 1900oo], n.p.</page><page sequence="21">368 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY through extended cooperation, mankind, especially in west- ern societies, had made at least limited progress-hardly at all in the fine arts; to an extremely small degree in man's moral nature; perceptibly in political institutions, as American de- mocracy illustrated; and most obviously in the ability to create wealth, as modern industrial, technologically innovative capitalism indicated. In establishing this hierarchy of progres- sivist tendencies, Sumner was substantially in accord with other commentators on progress.50 Nevertheless, his understanding of human nature and civi- lization as standing always on the edge of atavism led him ulti- mately to reaffirm the ancient doctrine of cycles in human affairs and in the universe. The beast in men threatened al- ways to reassert itself whenever human weakness and perver- sity combined with natural forces like those expressed by the law of population to bring disaster. The implications of the Second Law of Thermodynamics served to intensify Sumner's pessimism and extend it to cosmic scale. Sumner did believe that human instinct and intelligence had created progress within the limiting conditions set by the great forces of the universe. But his layman's knowledge of scientific theory and long observation of the human scene, as well, perhaps, as per- sonal experience and temperament, led him to believe that, if man's regressive tendencies did not first do so, cosmic forces would finally overwhelm the slow, uncertain progress that mental effort, suffering, and hard work had managed over millennia to achieve. As a sociologist Sumner was a student of man's past and present tendencies. It may have been that his prophecies con- cerning the human future depended primarily upon his empirical studies. Yet it was perhaps more than coincidental that scholarship led to conclusions which were compatible with his personal attitudes and mood. In his early years Sum- ner's Christian optimism militated against a dark view of the human destiny, although pessimistic foreshadowing occasion- 50 Van Doren, Idea of Progress, 455.</page><page sequence="22">WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER 369 ally appeared. Sumner was converted to evolutionary theory primarily through the influence of Spencer, but he was in no way converted to Spencer's faith that mankind must ulti- mately become perfect. Sumner, less the formalist, more skeptical, pragmatic, and empirically minded than Spencer, was led over the years to dismal predictions by the combined implications of a social Darwinistic view of human nature and the teaching of the Second Law. Like other disillusioned nat- uralists and prophets of cataclysm, Sumner increasingly op- posed the popular optimism of his age and country with mingled nostalgia and near-despair. Not long before he died in 191o, Sumner told a friend that he had lived through America's best years and would prefer not to live on into a twentieth century filled with social conflicts and wars."' Sum- ner believed, albeit reluctantly, that he had lived in an age and culture which had reached the pinnacle of human prog- ress. For Sumner, a consistently harsh social critic, virtually the American Jeremiah, both past and future spelled re- gression. Although in both his religious and naturalistic phases Sum- ner reconciled determinism and human volition, he always recognized that cosmic forces would prevail. As he had taught parishioners early in his career, men were chips on the current of Providential purpose. Symptomatically, as he turned from preaching to secular, naturalistic, sociological pursuits, God's mighty plan was gradually transmuted into Nature's inexor- able laws. And whether as progressivist, regressivist, or in- terpreter of cycles, Sumner was attracted, like the major social theorists of his day, to a sense that the human destiny would be decided ultimately by impersonal cosmic forces.52 51 Stow Persons, American Minds: A History of Ideas (New York, 1958), 222, 23o; Frederic Cople Jaher, Doubters and Dissenters: Cataclysmic Thought in America, 1885-1918 (London, 1964), passim; Albert Galloway Keller, Remi- niscences of William Graham Sumner (New Haven, 1933), 109. 52 Hildebrand notes in Teggart, The Idea of Progress, 24, that Carl Becker refers in these terms to Marx, Comte, and Darwin.
