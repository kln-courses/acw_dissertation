<plain_text><page sequence="1">Encountering Evil: Ghosts and demonic Forces i n the Lives of the Song E： l_ i t e Liao Hsien-huei NATIONAL CHI NAN UNIVERSITY, TA 丨 WAN The Song witnessed an intense belief in the perilous omnipresence of specters.1 Ghosts and demons lived vividly in the religious imagination of Song people and comprised the most familiar and intimate sphere of the supernatural within their daily lives. Characterized as inimical and vindictive, these beings, singly or in panic-causing hordes，inflicted every sort of terror, illness, injury, and death. The prevalence of such a belief was by no means a folk creation affecting only illiterate commoners, for the elite world was also shadowed by the various interventions of malevolent forces and engaged in frequent battle with them. Edward Davis and Judith Boltz, for example, both contend that it was common for members of the Song bureaucratic elite to cope with demonic threats by enthusiastically availing themselves of various exorcistic rituals.2 In his effort to bring to light the demonic aspect of Chinese I would like to thank Professors Richard von Glahn, Benjamin A. Elman, David Sabean, Linda Walton, and the anonymous JSYS reviewers for their helpful comments, criticisms, and suggestions. 1.

Apart from religious exorcism and political strategies, members of the elite also resorted to philosophical refutation and ritual propitiation when malignant spirits challenged their secular authority and personal lives. Sometimes they won the war, while other times they fell prey to demonic assaults. The close contact maintained between the living world and the world of spirits demonstrates that demonic power was perceived to be so strong that all levels of society were prey to it. No study of Song popular belief in ghosts would be complete without considering the roles of the Song elite in the creation and recreation of contemporary beliefs.4 Previous studies have ad dressed such topics as the development of exorcistic rites and the formation of the Wutong cult during the Song? Yet, to reach a clear understanding of the evolution of the demonic side of Song religion, it is also necessary to take elite religious views and practices as the subject of study in and of itself. Inquiry into the Song literati's relationship to the world of demons not only helps to clarify the place that popular beliefs occupied in their lives，but also shows how prevalent beliefs in ghosts and demonic forces took shape in the particular sociopolitical context of the Song. It is not surprising that Song literati and the rest of the society shared much common ground in their views and practices concerning demonic forces. In contrast to previous eras when pedigree was the key to office-holding，the Song ruling elite came from a much broader social background and constituted a more fluid group.6 Though the extent to which social mobility took place dur 3. von Glahn, The Sinister Way, 180-221. For a similar argument, see also Valerie Hansen, Changing Gods in Medieval China, U2y-i2j6 (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1990), 79-104. 4. Certainly, religious specialists also played a key role. As mediators between the living and the unseen worlds, religious specialists performed duties related to their religious roles while serving the needs of lay people.

The relative permeability of social boundaries in the Song suggests that views of the supernatural were widely shared. This does not mean，however, that demonic beliefs exerted the same influence in the lives of Song literati as they did in the lives of ordi nary people, nor did Song literati react to demonic threats in the same way as everyone else. I shall contend, instead, that the Song literati's perceptions of, and reactions to, spirits differed from those of the rest of society in a very significant way. The unique social，cultural，and political roles the Song literati played were the key factors in shaping their relations with the spirit world. On the one hand, with their knowledge of the classical language and political power, the Song literati were generally better armed than their commoner counterparts when battling against demonic assaults. While the masses could not help but 29-61; Robert Hartwell, "Demographic, Political and Social Transformations of China, 750—1550."

Some historians did not regard the theoretical replacement of aristocracy by meritocracy as a dramatic change. Hartwell, for example, maintains that during the first one hundred fifty years of the Song the meritocracy was simply a new form of aristocracy. It was not until the twelfth century that the hereditary elite lineages disappeared as a separate status group and became indistinguishable from those of the local gentry. Based on his case study of the local elite in Fuzhou 撫州，Hymes also suggests a significant continuity of the local elite families in maintaining their privileged status. To keep achieving success in the civil service examinations by their family members was one part of a broad array of their strategies. It is certainly true that some aristocrats based on their economic and cultural heritage were able to reproduce and perpetuate their prestige through the new system and thus successfully transformed themselves into "cultural" aristocrats. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the examination system of the Song generally figured as a visible way for social ascendancy, even if the actual chances it opened up for commoners were still very limited.

Their classical training usually enabled them to master various exorcistic incantations of different religious traditions in order to defend themselves. Also, they could exercise the political power they possessed, such as the seal of office and military forces, to expel diabolic spirits.s On the other hand, they seem to have been more reluctant than commoners to call on religious exorcists for help. As Confucian-educated elites and loyal state officials, the Song literati had to consider carefully whether their religious actions might provoke tension between their role expectations and practical needs and cause conflicts among themselves. Moreover, the Song literati and ordinary people were often subject to different demonic assaults according to the different social and political positions in which they were respectively situated. Those who assumed official posts, for instance, were often susceptible to demonic assaults closely related to their political authority, such as being haunted by the wronged souls of those unjustly convicted. The same assaults would be less likely to figure as a threat to ordinary people, who were not entitled to conduct investigations or make judgments. Sometimes discrep ancies between elite and commoners emerged even when they reacted to the same demonic occurrences. For instance, many Song officials tended to view demonic retribution as punishment for their judicial performance, while commoners hailed it as a powerful weapon to redress the abuse of justice by their rulers. Although omnipresent spirits and demonic forces assaulted both literati and ordinary people, their perceptions and responses differed. In the following sections, I shall turn to individual demonic occurrences to discuss the circumstances that predisposed Song literati to assaults from demons, the nature of the ghosts they encountered, and the ways they reacted.

The fear, anxiety, illness, and even death caused by demonic invasions were very private and subjective, thus rarely encountered in official records. In documenting demonic occurrences, most official records tend to focus on how the ruling authorities pinned down and vanquished evil spirits and heterodox cults, leav ing their emotional struggles, physical sufferings, and the details about the battle itself untouched.111 Despite the gap in official records，understanding the ways in which Song literati reacted to spiritual forces provides a window into their perceptions and mentality. An inquiry into the dilemmas they faced is also indispensable for understanding the nature of demonic forces encountered. Among the various demonic occurrences the Song literati experienced, those that emerged in the course of their official duties have attracted most scholarly attention.11 Many studies treat the Song literati's relations to malig nant spirits as one between persecutors and the persecuted, and thus fail to go beyond the stereotypical official documentation.12 A few others try to uncover the Song literati's complex relations with supernatural forces by delving into their actual practices as a way of comprehending their perceptions. Boltzs study on Song local administrators' battles with demonic forces is illustrative.13 Through an analysis of the adversity that befell Song officeholders，Boltz con tends that demonic occurrence was a supernatural arena where the governor ties Zhiguai’” Chinese Literature: Essays，Articles, Reviews 13 (1991)： 15-34; and Shen, Songdai minjian de youming shijieguan，85-128. 10.

As she stated, newly commissioned officials in unfamiliar terrain were most vulnerable to the demonic threats manipulated by local residents to defy the unwanted outside authority. Reck less suppression might cause local disturbances or personal injuries to the official himself if the spiritual presence represented the collective interest of the local community. Yet unreserved submission to the local spirits would directly undermine their authority, jeopardizing their governance. Thus, maintaining the power balance between the official realm and the realm of the spirits figured as a critical issue in their official tenure.H Boltz's study demonstrates that the social and political conditions within which the Song elite was situated often compelled them to deal with super natural occurrences with great care. A perusal of the Song literati's encounters with ghosts confirms that such occurrences did indeed mirror their predica ment of governing an unfamiliar terrain, and sometimes their preoccupation with maintaining effective governance, as Boltz has maintained. However, what made demonic forces so real and dreadful involved many different fac tors. Apart from the power struggle depicted by Boltz, the prevalent social practices and religious concepts implanted in the minds of the Song literati were significant in shaping the elite's views and practices. Moreover, those with no political power, such as examination candidates, school instructors, and retired officials, also faced similar assaults, suggesting that we need to explain their adversity in a much broader context. The empirical cases that I shall explore below are of three kinds, namely, the Song literati's encounters with avenging ghosts, with seductive apparitions, and with wandering specters. There are several reasons for choosing them as subjects of analysis. First of all, the extant material shows that these kinds of incidents not only appear repeatedly in the testimony of Song literature, but also constitute the majority of Song ghost stories. The ghostly beings Song literati encountered were of various kinds and origins, ranging from human spirits to various animate and inanimate apparitions. Their appearance in different social and political contexts enables us to observe the Song literati's relations with them both in their public roles as officials or Confucian pro ponents and in their private lives. 14. T) Hinrichs also highlights the political concerns lying behind the Song official endeavors to transform such entrenched local practices as denionological healing in south China, though in a different manner.

Some governors were haunted to death soon after making unjust verdicts, while others suf fered retribution long after the unfair judgments.1' The assaults upon them by vengeful ghosts undeniably exemplify deep-rooted beliefs in the causal ity between transgression and punishment and the efficacy of supernatural intervention. What remains unclear is why the Song witnessed an explosion of wronged souls’ vengeance against administrative governors, and why the violation of laws was punishable by supernatural powers. One explanation is that Song local government was so corrupt that powerless commoners could not help but seek divine intervention to redress injustice.16 To be sure, abuse of one's judicial authority often was the immediate cause of ghostly vengeance. Yet, judicial corruption alone seems insufficient to explain the ubiquity of the assaults by vengeful ghosts upon the Song literati, for no government is able to free itself from similar corruption, and more importantly there is no convincing evidence proving that the Song dynasty was any worse in this regard.1. In fact, it might even be said that the Song legal achievement was unmatched by any other imperial period.18 The Song government did indeed endeavor to improve its legal system, especially during the Northern Song 15. There are cases in which the governors in charge did not face the just retribution until their next reincarnations. See, for example, Hong Mai 洪邁(1123-1202), Yijian zhi 夷堅'志 (Taipei： Mingwen shuju, 1982)，zhijing 支景，5. 918. 16.

Besides, because the explanatory model of bureaucratic corruption is readily applicable to the ghosts vengeance in different historical periods，it is hard to distinguish the Song from other eras in this regard. In her study of the revenge ghost in Yuan drama, for instance, Joyce Liu also ascribes the popularity of the revenge theme to the corruption and injustice of the contemporary government.

In his study of Chinese legal institutions, Xu Daolin 徐道鄰 argues that the Song was the golden period of the traditional Chinese legal system. Zhongguo fazhi shi lunji 中國法制 史論集(Taipei： Zhiwen chubanshe, 1975)，89, 146. Mainland scholars also contend that the highest legal achievement of traditional Chinese society lies in the Song era.

The separation of criminal interrogation from sentence giving, for instance, was one of the crucial steps taken to forestall individual manipulation.-11 A more direct means to prevent officials and clerks from accepting bribes and distorting the law was to impose severe punishment on violators.21 Still, the most fundamental driving force probably came from the Song emperors who took the law seri ously and often devoted themselves to maintaining its efficiency." These emperors believed that an orderly society is attainable only when the law is firmly established.Meanwhile, under the influence of correlative cosmology， Song emperors and officeholders tended to asc ribe both natural disasters and personal misery to the miscarriage of justice. The droughts and plagues of locusts that occurred in the years 981，991，992, 995, and 1028—to name just a few—were all explained as the result of then current judicial problems.24 19- For the totalistic： vision of political and social order, and the specific reform in education, medicine, and finance during the Song, see Robert P.

On the one hand, increasingly intensive surveillance and severe punishment compelled Song officials to conduct judicial matters with great care. Any mistake they made, intentionally or not, would be detrimental to their future career and could incur severe punishment. On the other hand, it seemed impossible to avoid making judicial mistakes given the variety of difficult situations they were obliged to confront. Youth and inexperience, for instance, often forced newly-appointed officials to rely heavily on the assistance of judicial clerks who easily subjected them to manipulation.26 Similarly, short-term assignments generated by frequent transfers prevented officeholders from familiarizing themselves with local customs and practices and forced them to entrust judicial matters to local clerks.2 The judicial pressure imposed from above soon aroused the anxiety of the officials in charge. The prevalent fear of vengeful ghosts among the Song literati was in part a reflection of such anxiety. Without taking note of this psychological impact exerted by changes in the contemporary judicial context, it is hard to understand why so many Song literati witnessed, narrated, and even personally experienced ghostly vengeance. The Song literati's belief in karmic retribution and supernatural forces was essential to the translation of earthly adversity into struggle against supernatu ral forces. As revealed in various cases, many Song literati did indeed share 25. Xu zizhi tongjian changbian，56:193-19!). Bian Gun was so strict and hardhearted that he often applied excessive corporeal tortures on the offenders. Even emperor Zhenzong 眞宗(r. 998-1022) considered his way of governance too harsh to be appropriate for other officeholders to model. For Bian Gun's biography and harshness, see Tuo Tuo 脫脫，et al., Songshi (Taipei: Dingwen shuju, 1983)，277. 9434-9435. 26. In several epitaphs dedicated to his fellow colleagues, Wang Anshi 王安石（io2i-io86) noted repeatedly the extreme difficulties faced by young officials in handling judicial matters. The difficulties came not only from their youth and inexperience, but also from the intentional manipulation of cunning clerks and powerful residents.

An anecdote about Liu Kai 柳開 (947-1000), one of the early Song scholars striving to revive Confucianism, is illuminating? Once, on his way to his appointed position in Quanzhou 全州(Guangxi), Liu learned of a haunted post station in Yangzhou 揚州 (Jiangsu) from a local clerk and voluntarily offered to help expel the alleged evil spirit. Because Liu often boasted that his writings and courage were powerful enough to terrify both spirits and humankind, his best friend, Pan Lang 潘閬，decided to deflate his arrogance. That night when Liu stayed in the haunted room, Pan disguised himself as a ghost with green-dyed skin, leopard clothes, a calf's nose，fangs, long disheveled hair, and a sledgehammer to terrify him. His fearsome mien，together with a loud scream, almost scared Liu to death. Although Liu immediately begged forgiveness for his audacity， the “ghost，’ castigated him for having secretly committed unlawful acts and threatened to take him to the underworld authorities. Terrified, Liu confessed his guilt in tears, hoping to propitiate the ‘‘ghost.” When he finally realized his friend had tricked him, Liu was so ashamed that he left immediately the next morning. Although there was no real ghost in this account, both protagonists were well aware of the law of supernatural order and ideas about demonic retribution. Without knowledge of these beliefs, Pan Lang would not have been able to mock Liu Kai in the guise of a ghost dispatched by the infernal authorities. By the same token, Liu would not have been so easily terrified if he had not been indoctrinated with the same sets of ideas. A similar scenario also occurred between the instructor and students at the prefectural school of Hongzhou 洪州(Jiangxi). Though slightly different, this event conveys the same impression that the existence and power of the spirit world were com monly shared convictions.29 The school instructor reportedly was very mean to students, so the latter decided to take revenge. The plan was to frighten him by having a student disguise himself as a ghost messenger. In order to make it as realistic as possible, the students forged a written summons from the infernal judiciary like the one that all ghost messengers in folk legends 28.

Later, however, before reading through the infernal document, he caught sight of the ox-like horns on the ghost's head，a typical image of infernal messengers，and only then did he realize that the ghost was no fake.30 He burst out screaming and died immediately. It was reported that a real ghost who had lost his original official summons twenty years before was finally able to catch the instructor thanks to the lifelike document, thus fulfilling his long overdue duty. Further evidence of the Song literati's immersion in the spirit world can be found in accounts of return-from-death experiences (ruming 入冥，liter ally, "entering into the world of the dead”). Given the chance to return alive from underworld sojourns，the Song literati had much to say about what they had seen and heard in the mysterious realm of the dead.31 Accounts of underworld visions generated mostly by life-threatening circumstances and dreams thus point to a supernatural reality reflected in their mental states,2 Many Song literati found their underworld adventures scary and admonitory： they witnessed the souls of the sinful being savagely tortured，and at times they themselves were put on trial or summoned for cross-examination.Others 30. The ghost messengers mentioned in the story of Zuo Liang 左良 also had curved horns on their heads by which the protagonist recognized their identities as infernal messengers. They are the so-called ox-headed runners (niutou zu 牛頭卒)or ox-headed prison wardens (niutou yuzu 牛頭獄卒)in hell. Yijian zhi, ding 丁，i. 540. 31. Only very few protagonists relate their experience in the underworld with reservation. For example, Liang Yuanming ’梁元明，a son-in-law of a friend of Hung Mai's, foresaw his death during an underworld adventure in a dream. He did not release this information to anyone else, including his spouse, as the infernal official had admonished him not to do so. Yijian zhi, yi 乙， io. 270-271. 32.

A legion of officials and clerks constituted the government and took charge of the foregoing functions in practice. The yellow-clad servants, for instance, often served as infernal messengers and prison guards广 while those attired in green or purple garments were infernal officials or leaders of each department administering the life span and fortune of the living.'6 Encounters with these infernal bureaucrats and functionaries usually heralded fantastic trips down to the underworld/ These various cases indicate that the Song literati were not only aware of the structure and functions of the spirit world, but also convinced by its powers of intervention. They firmly believed in the infallible working of the law of retri bution and the existence of an omnipotent underworld where the sinful were harshly punished and vengeful souls presented their grievances and secured justice.、Consequently, it is fair to say that religious belief, judicial anxiety， and moral discipline were all significant factors inextricably intermixed with the ghosts' assault on Song judicial officials. From a few examples it will be helpful to expound how these factors intermingled，exerting a great impact on the lives of many Song literati. We shall begin with the story about a district magistrate who had lived under the shadow of ghostly vengeance ever since he had conducted a judicial matter yeyu 齊東里f 語(Bejing: Zhonghua shuju, 1997), 7.126-129. After entering hell, the sinful souls would be sliced, roasted, pounded, or ground according to the nature of their sin. 34.

The appearance of the infernal officials and clerks in the living world may also indicate someone's imminent death. See, for example, Yijian zhi, zhiwu, 2.1067-1068. 38. For the Song literati's vision of the underworld, see Liao Hsien-huei, "Visualizing the Afterlife： The Song Elite's Obsession with Death, the Underworld, and Salvation," Hanxue yanjiu 、漢學研究(Chinese Studies) 20. 1(2002): 399-440.</page><page sequence="13">SONG ELITE improperly."'9 It is reported that during the Chunxi 淳屛巨 reign (1174-1189)，the county magistrate of Lin'an 臨安(Zhejiang), Zhu Siyan 朱'思彥，arrested a married couple for embezzlement and kept them under detention for more than a month. Under constant torturous inquisition, the couple barely survived and reportedly died right after they were released. This result worried Zhu, who believed that their crime was not serious enough to deserve death and that ghostly revenge would be visited upon him. He could not eat well or sleep well and began to see hapless, naked ghosts with disheveled hair and signs of torture all over the bodies，which made him gravely ill. The assistant magistrate, who had secretly released the couple out of mercy and lied about their death，could not but confess and prove that the couple was still alive. Only then did Zhu feel relaxed and dramatically recover from his illness. As shown in this case, ghostly vengeance was a psychologically-induced hallucination, but the fear it aroused was so real and profound as to seriously upset a persons physical and mental well-being. Clearly, this fear was neither simply supernatural nor simply judicial, but a product of interaction between the two, that is，belief in ghosts and anxiety over judicial misdeeds. The inter nalization of the former and the emergence of the latter mutually interacted. The grievance that the ghosts expressed in a hallucination to the magistrate, who was thus rendered speechless，not only reflects the magistrate s mental state, but also highlights the foregoing interaction in precise language： "Our crime was supposed to incur no more than the punishment of exile, but we ended up sinking into the realm of the dead. Furthermore, you were so ruthless to us that you even ordered the assistant magistrate to dispose of our corpses. There is no reason for us to let you go free and we intend to drag you to the underworld and put you on trial."40 In contrast to the above case where judicial and moral anxiety provoked visions of ghosts, a vast number of cases reveal that judicial misdeeds and anxi ety were exposed only when something anomalous had occurred. Although it has been noted that Confucians tended to be reticent about their offenses and wrongdoing，41 cases of ghostly retribution afford considerable insight into their 39. Yijian zhi, zhigeng, 5. 915-916. This story is told by Lii Danian 呂大年，a Southern Song scholar official who had offered Hong Mai more than four juan 卷 of anecdotes. For a discussion of Lii Danian, see Wang Nianshuang 王年雙，"Hong Mai shengping jiqi yijianzhi zhi yanjiu 洪邁生平及其夷堅志之研究” (Ph.D. diss.，National Zhengzhi University, 1988)，261. 40. Yijian zhi, zhigeng, 5. 915-916. 41. According to Pei-yi Wu, it was not until the Ming that Confucians overtly showed "a deep</page><page sequence="14">102 deep sense of guilt and self-reproach concerning administrative misdeeds. It is noteworthy that confession of guilt and sins was not simply motivated by an intrinsic sense of morality，as one might have imagined. Rather, it was often the inescapable supernatural sanctions and the ensuing suffering that drove the Song literati to disclose their secret transgressions. What happened to a certain Xinchang 新昌(Jiangxi) prefect named Huang 黃 during the Yuanfu 元符 reign (1098-1100) is a case in point.42 When he served as the administra tor for public order (sili 司理)ofYuanzhou 袁州(Jiangxi) three years earlier, Huang conspired to give an unjust sentence, which resulted in four innocent deaths. Everyone involved except him succumbed to a mysterious death one after another within forty days. It seems that the causal link between the sud den deaths and the unjust verdict they had made was unknown to the public, and that Huang alone seemed to have dodged retribution. Soon after the other malefactors died, however, vengeful ghosts appeared and told Huang that his retribution would be delayed for three years by the mercy of the supreme god (shangdi 上帝）until he would visit Yuanzhou again.4 ' Bearing this warning in mind, Huang refused to visit Yuanzhou when two colleagues, Xiang and Zhen, invited him to go along at the prophesied time of his death. Yet，under their forceful invitation，he could not but go with them, though feeling uncomfortable. By the gate of the prefecture, he tried again, in vain, not to move on. Soon after reaching Xiang's house in Yuanzhou, he started to act strangely. At first, he was absent-minded, seem ing to be possessed by something. Then, he showed great interest in one of Xiang's home ornaments, a brass plate, hoping to purchase it as his funeral furnishing.44 Shortly after retiring, he burst out screaming in pain, and then awareness of the human proclivity to evil, an urgent need to counter this proclivity, a readiness for self-disclosure, and a deep anguish over one's wrongdoing." Pei-yi Wu, "Self-examination and Confession of Sins in Traditional China," HJAS 39.1 (1979): 5-38. 42. Yijian zhi, yi, 6. 228-231. 43. The reason whv Huang alone did not face his retribution immediately, as the wronged souls explained, was because he once tried to redress the wrong, though without persistence. The supernatural authority thus accorded him an extra three years of life. 44. Each of the protagonists moves seemed to have a bidden significance. So did his pur chase of the brass plate. In traditional China, it was a general belief that a brass plate or brass (bronze) mirror niav serve the purpose of keeping awav spirits. Therefore, they were indispensable items for funeral furnishings. Huang's purchase of it indicated not only that he had foreseen his imminent death, but probably also that he wanted to get away from the wronged souls' assault after death. For a general discussion of the symbolic meaning of bronze mirrors in traditional</page><page sequence="15">103 he suffered from severe，bloody diarrhea all night long. Only on the verge of death did he confess that his illness was caused by ghostly vengeance of his wrongful adjudication, and announce that the vengeful ghosts were standing beside him waiting to take his life. In addition to the protagonists self-reproach and the enforcement of retribu tive justice by supernatural authority, this story also reveals a shared belief in demonic retribution among Song officials. Huangs conviction of supernatural power is beyond doubt since he plainly ascribed his suffering to demonic retri bution. The other two officials, though at first terrified by Huang's suffering, were likewise imbued with the idea of supernatural intervention, for they did not question Huang's explanation, but took it seriously. Upon learning that the vengeful ghosts were present, they set up an altar, burned incense, and changed into formal attire to solicit alleviation of Huang's physical torture. It turned out that their prayers did indeed work because Huang's pain and diar rhea stopped instantly. The narrator, who was the son of Xiang and was thus probably also an eyewitness，confirmed the supernatural causality involved in this story.4’ By lining up several seemingly discrete events，he was able to show persuasively the infallible working of supernatural retribution. Although the Song literati were often the narrators, eyewitnesses，or victims of ghostly vengeance，they themselves occasionally suffered unjust treatment and then deliberately invoked supernatural retribution. Believing that the underworld authorities had the power to redress the wrong more effectively than the secular government, some literati attempted to lodge their complaints with the netherworld bureaucracy. The story about Jia Chengzhi 賈成之，the controller-general (tongpari 通判）of Hengzhou 橫州（Guangxi)，serves as a good example.46 It was reported that the new prefect，Zhao Chi 趙持，did not get along with Jia. Zhao colluded with his best friend to poison Jia after he brought a false charge against Jia in vain. But on his deathbed Jia comforted China, see C. A. S. Williams, Outlines of Chinese Symbolism and Art Motives (New York： Dover Publications Inc., 1976), 61； and Komai Kikutani 駒井和愛，Chûgoku kokyô no kenkyû 中國古 鏡乃研究(Tokyo： Iwanami shoten, 1953), 7-13. 45. Born into the family of an official, the narrator, Xiang Bofen 向伯奮，also became an officeholder himself. In 1123, he assumed the post of prefect of Kaifeng 開封(Hebei). Later, he was appointed to the post of Jianzhou 建州(Fujian) prefect. For detailed information about Xiang, see Wang, "Hong Mai shengping," 245. 46. This story was told by Wang Han 王翰，the former prefect of Hengzhou，who worked harmoniously with ]ia for four years. Yijian zhi, yi, 19. 344-345.</page><page sequence="16">104 his wife b\' vowing he would take revenge： “It is unnecessary to go through the channels of secular authorities, I will appeal directly to the underworld bureaucracy for satisfaction. In three days, or no more than five days, I will first take Zhao's life and then the lives of all the other collaborators." As expected, Zhao and his partners all claimed to have seen Jia s ghost chasing after them, and afterwards they became gravely ill. Soon they all died. In similar fashion, the assistant prefect of Mingzhou 明州(Zhejiang) also turned to the underworld for justice when he was wrongly accused.4 It was reported that when he was dying, he admonished his son to prepare the docu ments for him with which he would reclaim justice in the underworld： “I die with un-rcdressed injustice. Be sure to collect all the official documents and contracts related to my case and put them in my coffin. I will try my best to lay a plaint before the underworld government in order to right the wrong." As in the previous case, all the malefactors died suddenly one after another. Apparently the victims of judicial misconduct were not limited to the com mon folk, but often included officeholders; the latter reacted to their unjust treatment in exactly the same way as the former. Many Song literati also believed that the underworld had the power to interfere in human affairs, and that the abuse of justice was punishable by supernatural authorities if the secular government failed to do so. This conviction was evident in a school instructor's lamentation, when he sighed with emotion after witnessing a fel low official suffer demonic retribution: "It is tremendously awe-inspiring to make judicial judgment."48 In conclusion, the conventional explanation of ghostly vengeance as a defensive counterattack employed by the weak and powerless and a deliberate negation of the secular law is too simplistic. Seduction by Alluring Apparitions Among the various kinds of demonic infiltration, encounters with seductive apparitions probably affected the Song literati the most. In contrast to the avenging ghosts, whose appearances were causally linked to certain prior im moral or illegal deeds of judicial officials, seductive apparitions often appeared unexpectedly. Because their emergence was unpredictable and unrelated to moral conduct, anyone might run into sexually attractive spirits in human form 47- Yijian zhi, zhiwu, 5： 1086-1088. 48. "Lingyu zhishi shen kewei zai 圏圄之事深可畏哉，” Yijian zhi, yi, 20. 354.</page><page sequence="17">105 and unknowingly develop intimate relationships with them. Such intimate contact was ostensibly quite pleasant and romantic, at least at the beginning. Yet the consequences were not necessarily benign. Some protagonists enjoyed good fortune and happy lives as a result of intimacy with ghost lovers; others were forced to bring an end to the relationship； still others became ill and died. While the positive outcomes prevailed in the lore of previous and subsequent eras, the majority of Song accounts seemed to end tragically.49 Several recent studies have shed light on the profound and detrimental im pact that seductive apparitions exerted on the Song literati. In his study of Song examination culture，John Chaffee maintains that examination candidates were vulnerable to sexual seduction of all sorts，including alluring spirits.50 As he explains，living away from home and separated from their spouses and family during the examination period, most students, presumably young and inexperienced in the ways of the world, lacked the maturity to rein in their passion. When approached by seductive apparitions, they were unable to spurn the sexual advances and so were enticed into excessive sexual activity. Except for a few cases with happy endings, most such encounters gradually undermined the human protagonists' health，even to the point of endangering their lives. Shen Zongxian points out that，in addition to students，low-ranking officials were also targets of demonic seduction and ended up becoming gravely ill or losing their lives.’1 He argues that in contrast to high officials， who sought sexual pleasure from courtesans, the lower social strata satisfied their sexual fantasies through encounters with alluring spirits. Although those who fell victim to demonic seduction were almost invariably 49. There are only a few cases in which the elite protagonists received favors from their spirit lovers. Some of them were foretold of success in the civil service examination, or in the fortune in their official career, while others obtained health and longevity. See, for example, Chen Hu 陳韻，Xitang ji qijiu xuwen 西塘集耆舊續聞(Shanghai： Shanghai guji chubanshe，1993), 7. 51-54； and Yijian zhi，bing，11.459, zhibu，13.1667, ding, 19. 692. 50. John W. Chaffee, The Thorny Gates of Learning in Sung China (New York： Cambridge University Press, 1985), 169-175. In a slightly different manner, Liu Xiangguang 劉祥光 maintains that the Song elite's extreme anxiety over their individual and family fortune in a highly mobile society led to the negative reading of seductive apparitions. Because any indulgence in lust with unknown women was deemed detrimental to their career pursuit, female apparitions turned into symbols of danger in contemporary narratives. Liu Xiangguang, "Beiqie, nugui he songdai shiren de jiaolu 婢妾，女鬼和宋代士人的焦慮，” in Zouxiang jindai： Guoshi fazhan yu quyu dongxiang 走向近代:國史發展與區域動向（Taipei: Donghua shuju, 2004)，45~^4 51. Songdai minjian de youming shijieguan, 107-113.</page><page sequence="18">106 young persons, many older literati were also deeply affected by alluring spirits, though in a different way. Older literati were less likely to fall into traps of demonic sexual seduction, as they were mostly married and surrounded by courtesans and concubines, whose existence was socially permissible and economically affordable.’2 But there was no way that they could prevent their family members, adolescent boys and girls in particular, and younger associates from entanglement by such fatal attraction. Take Cai Jing 蔡京 (1047-1126 ), the chief minister，for example. In 1120’ Cai became very worried when his granddaughter-in-law was seduced by an anomalous creature and began to behave strangely.’、In order to save her from demonic seduction, he summoned a number of Daoist priests to exorcise the demonic being. All of them were defeated with humiliation except Zhang Xujing 張虛靖，the venerable thirtieth generation of the Celestial Masters，who drove away the allegedly evil creature and cured the girl. The above case is but one of many that show how the literati could also be affected by alluring spirits even when they themselves were not the objects of demonic seduction. These tales, unlike the pre-Song ones that predominantly focus on the parties involved and their doomed liaisons, place great weight instead on the spirits’ disruptive powers and the reactions of those closely related to the victims. They contain detailed descriptions of how and why many central and local officials and school instructors were compelled to battle against the spirits with whom their boys, girls, students, subordinates, and friends had intimate contacts.'4 Given that these tales were both narrated and read by the literati, it may be concluded that the Song literati no longer confined their vision to the wondrous seduction scenario itself as previous literati did. Rather, they fully acknowledged that when such spirits appeared, 52. According to Ebrey's study, in the eyes of the Song literati, there was nothing wrong with a man taking concubines. He would be criticized for being self-indulgent and undisciplined only if he became too preoccupied with them. Besides, it was very common and affordable to take concubines for "e\ en the lowest-ranking official might well be able to scrape together the monev for such a young woman."

In other words，the existence of alluring spirits and their power to intrude in people's lives was a common conviction among many literati, whether young or old, victims or not. Why, then, was demonic seduction true and authentic in the eyes of so many Song literati? How did alluring spirits come into being? Many scholars attribute the appearance of alluring spirits to the sexual repression of the literati, expounding that sexual disaffection in this world generates compen satory fantasizing about the unseen world. The above-mentioned studies by Chaffee and Shen, for instance，are typical in this respect. Actually this explanatory model has also been widely applied to the similar seduction stories of several historical periods, such as the Six Dynasties (third-sixth centuries), Tang (618—906)，and Qing (1644-1911) era.'5 It is then necessary to ask why the Song literati fantasized their relationships with ghost lovers in tragic ways when the literati of other eras tended to romanticize them.’6 Some scholars find the answer in the Song Confucian revival, suggesting that the Song literati —imbued with the newly revived Confucianism—began to 55- To name but a few： Anthony C.

P°° Mu-chou, in contrast, contends that "one needs to be more cautious in applying the ‘male sexual fantasy theory.'" As he suggests, "the romantic, seductive and unreserved female image found in the ghosts stories might have reflected real life situations to a certain degree." See Poo Mu-chou, ‘‘The Completion of an Ideal World： The Human Ghost in Early-Medieval China," Asia Major [Third Series, parts 1-2] VX (1997)： 69-94. 56. In his study of Six Dynasties romance, Hong Shunlong 洪順隆 contends that the rela tions between humankind and their ghost companions are often full of affection, devotion, and sincerity. Hong Shunlong, "Liuchao yilei lianai xiaoshuo chulun 六朝異類戀愛小說舞論，” Wenhua daxue zhongwen xuebao 文化大學中文學報 i (1993): 25-81. It is also the case of the Tang era when many examination candidates obtained consolation and compensation from spirit lovers for their physical and psychological adversity.

This hypothesis is problematic, however, since recent scholarship has amply demonstrated that Confucian teachings did not dominate the Song literati's everyday lives.,s More importantly, neither do the extant Song encounter ac counts support this hypothesis. One may find among the various seduction occurrences only a few cases in which the literati morally reproved those enchanted by alluring spirits for indulging in sexual fantasy with non-human beings.Most cases show, however, that they seemed to be more concerned about the physical safety of the possessed than their deviation from Confucian moral-ethical discipline. This pragmatic attitude is observable, for instance, in the case of a school instructor who saved one of his students from posses sion by a fairy (xiannii 仙女）in a temple mural that came to life.60 Because this student inexplicably became weaker and weaker, the instructor became suspicious and decided to question him as to the reason. As he suspected, the student had gotten caught up in the pleasures of the flesh with an unknown woman whom the instructor believed to be an evil spirit. Rather than rebuking him, the instructor warned him about the danger of the romance in question and tried to protect him： “You are going to die. For how could it be possible for a woman to go out every evening and stay overnight at school if she came from a good family? She must be either a ghost or an evil creature. If you want to remain alive, I will examine and expel the spirit for you."6'Apparently, 57. Li Shouju's 李壽菊 study of Chinese fox belief is an example. She explains the negative image of fox-spirits and their destructive impact on people during the Song as a result of the resurgence of Confucianism. Along with the Confucian revival, contemporaries stigmatized fox-spirits and their infiltration as immoral in terms of Confucian morals and value standards.

Instead, what he cared about the most was the students personal safety and the destructive power of the lewd spirit. The tragic features that distinguished Song seduction encounters were instead profoundly shaped by the contexts within which they emerged. In addi tion to the foregoing dire consequences, there were several other new features that characterized the Song literati's sexual encounters with the denizens of the spirit world. For example，the locations of the encounters had gradually shifted from such wilderness areas as deserted gravesites and desolate shrines to Song residential areas, Buddhist monasteries and local tutelary deity temples. The objects of seduction also slowly extended from students to government officials in different echelons. Similarly, the structure of seductive beings also underwent significant transformation as the predominance of natural spirits and animate and inanimate apparitions gradually gave way to human ghosts, including many who came from the families of officials. These changes in Song seduction encounters were by no means random fabrications but the result of a complex convergence of contemporary social, religious, and po litical factors. Rather than being discrete phenomena, as some scholars have suggested，62 these new features were closely linked to one another. An examination of Song seduction encounters reveals that while largely predetermined by the contemporary notion of demonic forces, their tragic nature also reflected, and was reinforced by, disastrous experiences some literati experienced in their own lives. In many Song tales, officeholders and examination candidates had love encounters when they assumed new posts or pursued scholarly honor alone in alien cities.63 Though initially pleasurable， most of the encounters concluded with grievances just as the encounters with 62. Shen Zongxian，for instance, suggests that the recurrence of seductive events in Buddhist monasteries is a reflection of the Song Confucian elite's stigmatization of, and hostility toward， Buddhism. The low-ranking officials' intimacy with alluring spirits distinguishes the erotic fantasy of the lower social strata from that of high officials. Meanwhile, he explains the increase in the numbers of female ghosts from officials' families and their lascivious behavior as the result of male fantasy and prejudice. Songdai minjian de y owning shijieguan, 107-113. 63. For the sake of safety, those who had been assigned posts in regions of disturbance tended to assume the offices alone. See, for example, Yijian zhi, yi, 5.222； and Dongxuan bilu, 10. no-111. Occasionally, the emperor would also prohibit the officials appointed to certain districts from taking their families with them. See, for example, Song huiyao jigao, xingfa, 2.1315-143.</page><page sequence="22">I 10 LI AO HSIEN-HUEI lewd spirits did. Because love encounters with living beings often turned out to be sexual traps set by avaricious native people, or involved immoral behavior, the literati concerned suffered all kinds of losses. Being defrauded of money and personal belongings, many protagonists became so impoverished that they had to give up their ambitions, while others became so frustrated that they died of depression. Moreover, some of them failed to pass the civil service examinations or to pursue official careers as a result of supernatural retribution for their enticing innocent women into unlawful sexual intercourse.64 Though their consequences were not identical, the Song literati's sexual encounters with living and non-living beings shared much common ground, including the recurring time, space, and dire consequences. The striking similarity shows that the detrimental impact of demonic seduction was not merely grounded in religious ideas, but also socio-politically constructed. Similarly, the change of the location of seduction encounters also was related to Song contemporary religious beliefs, practices, and the literati's lifestyle. Buddhist monasteries became one of the most notorious spots for demonic seduction during the Song era. Many stories tell of educated men who were frequently attracted to ghosts in the form of pretty women when putting up for the night at monasteries. Some of them soberly rejected their sexual advances, yet many were overjoyed and impatiently threw themselves into erotic pleasure when solicited/” The ghosts in these tales were either the spirits of those who died at the monastery, or more frequently of those whose encoffined bodies were stored at the monasteries.66 Given the common 64. See Chaffee，The Thorny Gates of Learning, 174-175, and Yijian zhi, zhibu, 8.1616-1623. Earlier precedents of these themes can be found in the famous Tang story Li wa zhuan 李娃 傳.For detailed analyses of this story, see Wang Meng'ou 王夢鷗，Tcmgren xiaoshuo jiaoshi 唐人小說校釋(Taipei： Zhengzhong shuju, 1983)，165-191； and Glen Dudbridge, The Tale of Li Wa： Study and Critical Edition of a Chinese Story from the Ninth Century (London： Ithaca Press, 1983). Despite the fact that these themes had occurred before, the Song accounts often highlight the destructive side of the affairs rather than on the emotional attachment of the parties involved. Moreover, the highly mobile lifestyle of Song officials and the educated elites not only contributed to the increasing prevalence of such encounters, but also made such encounters a shared concern among the Song literati. 65. See, for example, Songren yishi huibian, 8. 324； Yijian zhi, jia, 5. 40, bing, 2. 373-374, zhiwu, 8.1117-1118； G110 Tuan 郭彖（ca. 1165), Kueiche zhi 耳癸車志(Congshu jicheng chubian), 4. 33-34; and Wang Mingqing 王明清(1127-after 1214), Touxia lu 投轄錄(SKQS, v. 1038), 1. 23a-24b. 66.

Yet, one still needs to ask why all of a sudden Buddhist monasteries were full of unburied coffins during the Song，and why their ghosts seduced so many educated men. The answers lie in contemporary funeral practices and the Song literati's sociopolitical life. Many scholars have pointed out that Buddhist temples began to play more and more significant roles in funerary activities during the Song.67 One of the major functions they served was to be used as places to store coffins until burial could be arranged. Supposedly, such coffins remained at temples only for a short period of time, because no one wanted to leave the bodies of their deceased kin unburied and untended. In practice, however，the Song state began to show grave concern over this practice, as there were various situa tions under which coffins were deposited indefinitely and the unburied coffins were thus piled up. The unknown dead, for example, were often brought to temples for encoffining and then abandoned there. Sometimes, coffins could also be retained for years, decades，or even generations simply because the living could not figure out an auspicious date and spot for burial.68 Moreover, on their frequent transfers due to short-term assignments，many Song officials unable to take deceased family members back to their hometown for burials left the coffins of the deceased at temples.69 With all these coffins stored 67.

Zhu Xi s arrangement of his son's burial ceremony was typical. In a letter to Chen Liang 陳亮(1143-1194), Zhu mentioned that he did not bury his son right away because the diviner said that the burial should not take place until a year later. The coffin was thus kept in a funeral establishment for that period of time. Huian xiansheng zhuwengong wenji 晦庵先生朱文公 文集，xuji 續集，7. 8a~9a.

As many accounts attest, the people who lodged at the compounds during the Song were not the only ones susceptible to their seduction； many monks and novices also fell into the same traps. Still, Buddhist compounds would not have become the center of demonic encounters without the match between their supply of accommodations and the Song literati's demand for lodging. Attracted to their offerings of free room, food, and a quiet environment, many individual students came to lodge at Buddhist temples during the preparation for the civil service examinations or on their way to the examination halls. " Many officeholders also considered Buddhist temples preferable alternatives for overnight stays when they were on business trips, or in transit from one post to another. 1 They became ac customed to staying overnight at Buddhist compounds as more and more temples were established during the Song, serving food and accommodations at the places in need. 2 Some of them were located at thoroughfares or on the main official highways, while others were at strategic mountain passes where travelers' facilities were scarce. Expectedly, Buddhist monasteries received many more examination candidates and scholar officials during the Song when high mobility characterized the literati's lives. That many Song literati who lodged in Buddhist monasteries not only acknowledged their services, but also often encouraged them to provide more similar facilities also serves to corroborate the close interaction between the two.、 From the above discussion of Buddhist monasteries, it is clear that those who experienced demonic seductions included both Song examination candidates and active officials. Their seductive encounters were not merely a result of their sexual fantasies, but also inextricably mixed with their mobile 70. In contrast to their Tang counterparts where students might lodge in groups for educational purposes. Song Buddhist temples mostly received individual students and officials who mainlv needed a place to stay overnight. 71. Although it is difficult to estimate how often the officials went on business trips, it is clear that Song officials traveled a lot due to the frequent alteration of their assignments. According to Miao Shumei, the term of each local office was originally set at three years. In practice, however, the duration of each term was so short that officeholders often left their posts long before they were able to familiarize themselves with the culture and customs of their jurisdictions.

Moreover, the fact that the Song literati encountered more and more female ghosts of like family background can also be exemplified by the occurrences in the Buddhist mon asteries. Since many Song literati entrusted their deceased family members — wives, concubines and daughters in particular—to Buddhist institutions, it is plausible that the ghosts of an officials family became more numerous in monasteries. In other words, it was not because of their social and cultural preference that the Song literati began to fantasize about intimate contact with females of equivalent family backgrounds and cultural dispositions. Rather, it was more likely that the increase in the cases of Song literati's encounters with ghosts of officials' families was a projection of their own socioreligious practices onto the spirit world . Wandering Specters The third kind of demonic assault that the Song literati encountered mostly occurred in such public and official places as office halls, post stations， schools, and examination halls. Though the reason for the assaults by evil spirits did not seem to be personal, the consequences could be as deadly as the ones mentioned above. Take the haunted examination hall at Jiaxing 嘉 興(Zhejiang) for example.'4 It is reported that though thousands of students and their attendants squeezed into the compound during each examination session, the spirits lurking about the quarter did not retreat accordingly, but instead viciously haunted some participants to death. In succeeding years many candidates preferred to quit the examination rather than remain if they had been assigned to a seat notorious for demonic possession. Similarly, evil spirits occupied all kinds of office buildings, inflicting sufferings on the officials in charge. The sufferings were so unbearable that many officials subsequently refrained entirely from stepping into the haunted quarters in order to escape from the same misfortune. The prefects of Chengdu 成者 (Sichuan) and Xinzhou 信州(Jiangxi), for instance, both became sick and died due to demonic assaults that occurred in their offices/5 On the other hand, the prefect of Nan'en 南；恩(Guangdong) and the district defender 74.

Rather than suppressing and regulating demonic forces with the political authority invested in them, many Song officeholders themselves ironically fell prey to assault at the very places symbolizing their political authority. Who were the agents of demonic affliction that threatened and terrified the educated people to such an extent that even their shields of mundane authority became useless? A perusal of accounts of haunted offices and public buildings reveals that the apparitions involved were of various origins, ranging from anthropomorphic or personified deities, animate and inanimate spirits, to human ghosts. Yet the ones most frequently observed and harmful were probably the ghosts of those who, having suffered violent death during a great massacre or disturbance, had not been given a proper burial. Because they died prematurely, these ghosts could not attain reincarnation but instead wandered around the place of their unexpected, or unjust, death. In both Confucian and popular perceptions, such ghosts were so inimical and vindictive that they would inflict all kinds of evil upon the living until they were given a proper burial and periodically accorded sacrifices. s Though the destructiveness of wandering ghosts was a common conviction, it only partly explains the Song literati's encounters with demonic haunting in the official domain. l, Such evidence as the historical facts that serve to verify 76.

Most of the apparitions that they encountered in anecdotal lore were the ghosts of those whose existence and violent deaths could be traced to historical figures. The above-mentioned examination hall at Jiaxing, for instance, was said to be haunted by the ghosts of a rebel group，most of whom were ultimately executed. According to Song histori cal records，a riot led by Xu Ming 徐明 took place in the second year of the Jianyan 建炎 reign (1128)，just after the Southern Song had been founded.80 Though quickly suppressed, it devastated the Jiaxing (Zhejiang) area to such an extent that not only was the prefect held captive，but also heavy casualties were inflicted. Confronted by such a disturbance that critically undermined the newly founded regime, the state decided to inflict harsh punishment on the rebellious mob. The spot where these rebels were sentenced to death was exactly the same place where the Jiaxing examination hall was later built.81 Similarly, an event which took place in the prefectural office of Guangzhou 光州(He'nan) also exemplifies that demonic haunting was easier to acknowl edge when it coincided with social and political facts.82 This anecdote records residences where funerary rites were taking place, were the places where demonic afflictions took place the most. Because these places were often associated with death and ghosts, it is expected that demonic haunting would occur. Li Jianmin, "Suibing yu ‘changsuo’： chuantong yixue dui suibing de yizhong jieshi祟病與「場所」：傳統醫學對祟病的一種解釋，” Hanxue yanjiu 12. 1 (1994): Nevertheless, while providing a general sketch on the relation between demonic haunting and sites, these medical texts did not tell much about its changes over time. Nor did they relate demonic hunting to official domains. 80. In May 1128, Xu Ming, a solider in charge of tea and wine (chajiu zu 茶酒卒)，led a group of people to catch the Prefect Zhu Fei 朱帝 and keep him in captivity due to his tyranni cal governance. They then invited the previous prefect Zhao Shujin 趙叔近 to resume control. Zhao not only came as requested, but also successfully pacified Xu and other rebels. But before the central court received the memoir he presented, armed forces commanded by Zhang Jun 張俊 were dispatched in June to pacify the riot in question. As soon as Zhang arrived, he killed Zhao Shujin due to some selfish motives, which provoked the local people to rebel again. They had burned down many buildings and looted several places before they were finally suppressed and executed. Li Xinchuan 李心傳（ii66~i243)，Jianyan yilai xinian yaolu 建炎以來繁年要 錄(Taipei： Wenhai chubanshe, 1980), 11. 25,15. 324,16. 330; Songshi, 25. 456. 81. Cases in which an examination hall was built on such a site as this one are very common during the Song period. Due to the increasing number of the examination candidates, the Song government often appropriated Buddhist temples, schools, and various official buildings for examination halls. Liang Gengyao 梁庚堯，"Nansong de gongyuan 南宋的貢院，” in his Songdai shehui jingjishi lunji 宋代社會經濟史論集(Tapiei: Yunchen chubanshe, 1997), 118-164. 82.

Early in the Chunxi 淳熙(1174-1189) reign, a newly appointed prefect, Zheng Renjie 鄭人傑， and a friend of his，defied such warnings and sneaked in, hoping to unearth hidden treasures.s' They probably did so because they were not Guangzhou natives and thus were unaware of the tragedy the local people had experienced under the Jurchen invasion in the early Southern Song era. Contrary to their expectation, they found nothing valuable inside the arsenal but some broken weapons and hundreds of silk ribbons hanging from the roof beam. Accord ing to the local people, during the Jurchen invasion many local refugees had hanged themselves in the arsenal with those silk ribbons, while the invaders slaughtered others. Some strange creatures, half-man and half-horse, dressed like cavalrymen had also appeared and haunted the living since then. Only then did Zhen and his friend realize why the arsenal was haunted and how the prefecture had been thrown into disarray. But they seemed not to be terri fied until numerous skeletons were found and the legendary hybrid creatures appeared during an excavation half a year later. The prefect's friend, who was also an educated person, became too afraid to sleep and thus soon left the prefecture. While the convergence of demonic beliefs and socio-political facts accounts for the Song literati's conviction of the reality of demonic haunting, the con vergence itself was also historically constructed. As is well known, though it reunified China after the long decline and final collapse of the Tang, the Song regime faced a devastated country awaiting almost total reconstruc tion. One of the most urgent tasks was the rebuilding of official halls and public structures. The best ways to accomplish this task efficiently were to reconstruct the buildings on sites where no one claimed ownership, or to remodel some old buildings. Many temple ruins, war-devastated structures and lands, or cursed and deserted houses were thus frequently appropriated by the government for official and public facilities. The same practice was continuously carried out in the Southern Song when the state faced similar social and political circumstances. It was this measure that foreshadowed the later demonic haunting of many official buildings, for these locations were associated with killing, death, spirits，and corpses. As can easily be observed, 83. Probably because this arsenal had been kept locked for several decades, Zheng Renjie, a person ot greed\' nature, was aroused to imagine that there were secret treasures in it.</page><page sequence="29">117 many haunted offices and public buildings were built on or next to such loca tions as the sites of shrine ruins, deserted graves, former detention houses, or great massacres.84 Judging from the above discussion of the Song literati's encounters with different kinds of spirits, we can conclude that demonic forces not only pen etrated their private lives, but also affected their public performances. The ubiquity of demonic invasion indicates that Confucian teachings and political ideology did not dominate the Song literati's beliefs and practices to such an extent that there was no room left for popular ideas. On the contrary, the lat ter, interacting with other social and political factors, became so influential that they often exerted a greater impact on the Song literati than the former did. Hence, many literati succumbed to demonic assaults rather than merely suppressing them with political authority，or explaining them away as natural phenomena.85 Though the literati shared with ordinary people the fear of ghosts and demonic forces, they encountered some demonic threats that were exclusive to themselves. The same is true for the mechanisms they employed to cope with demonic forces, which is the focus of the section that follows. Compliance or Defiance: the Literati's Reaction to Demonic Assaults Given that malicious spirits were omnipresent in the lives of the Song literati, responding to demonic beings’ assaults was a frequent task for them. From investigating the way they reacted, one can get a better understanding of both their perceptions of demonic forces and their attitudes toward the esoteric arts. Although demonic occurrences often caused misfortunes like illness and death, not all victims helplessly waited for death while being haunted by evil spirits. Actually, in only a few cases did the victims resign themselves to death； in most others, elite victims, like commoners，actively sought help from all available sources. Yet, compared to the ordinary people who had to 84. Yijian zhi, yi, 12. 285,19. 346-347, 20. 358-359； Zhangshi keshu，1. 8b; Guixin zashi, xuji, shang, 1.129. More work need to be done before we can assert its specificity in the Song. 85. Of course, there were cases in which the Song literati triumphed over demonic forces. Aside from the much emphasized political authority and natural philosophy, the Song elite pre vailed over evil spirits through recourse to various religious exorcisms. Boltz's study, for instance, demonstrated nicely that it was common for Song officeholders to cope with demonic assaults by resort to Daoist exorcism. Boltz, "Not by the Seal of Office Alone," 241-305.</page><page sequence="30">I 18 rely heavily on exorcists to combat demonic forces, the Song literati had more alternatives. They could choose among various mundane and supernatural measures. The former included using political power to suppress evil spirits, claiming self-integrity to ward off demonic forces, or naturalizing anomalies to strip spirits of their supernatural power—all of which were at the literati's disposal. Among the supernatural options, the Song literati were capable of manipulating some esoteric arts such as incantations and exorcistic rites independently, in addition to beseeching religious exorcists for aid as the common folk did. Submission to Demonic Assault Why would some literati allow demonic forces to invade their lives and harass them without even making any attempt to fight back when they had all these options available? It is not that they lacked suitable means to defend them selves, but rather that resistance would be futile. Such a submissive attitude manifested itself most frequently in the Song literati's encounters with vengeful ghosts. Although panic and terror were the instinctive responses shared by most Song literati when attacked by demonic forces, their attitude soon changed if the assaults came from vengeful spirits. Because demonic vengeance resulted primarily from their own misdeeds，most literati tended to treat the ensuing sufferings as just retribution for their wrongdoing. They regarded it as futile to challenge the causal relationship between transgression and punishment, or to try to avoid what was seen as karmic retribution. The submissive attitude is found in the case of Fu Jianzhong 符建中，the district magistrate of Guixi 貴溪(Jiangxi), who reportedly died as a result of demonic retribution for his judicial misconduct.86 In 1132, when he was sitting leisurely with his wife at home, Fu suddenly turned his head aside, seem ingly to whisper to someone who was invisible. Later, after being questioned by his wife，he revealed that he had just had a conversation with an infernal messenger who came to arrest him and two other clerks. Because a solider he had had killed illegally in jail a year before appealed to the underworld authorities for justice, he and the two clerks involved were to be put on trial in the underworld. He believed that he was definitely going to die. Even though he had foreseen his imminent death, Fu did not seek help from anyone else 86. Yijian zhi, zhigui, 3.1244.</page><page sequence="31">119 but continued his life as usual. The next day, when the two clerks involved fell critically ill and died shortly after, Fu knew that his retribution was im minent. He then went into the bedroom and retired. By the time his wife came to check on him, he had already passed away. Similarly, Li Yuanli 李 元禮，the assistant magistrate of Longxi 育■溪(Fujian), reacted passively to a vengeful ghosts assaults. In 1156, he framed an innocent person on a charge of robbery to advance his own career. As soon as he was assigned to a new post, Li saw the ghost of the wrongly executed person standing in front him. Though extremely depressed, he did not resort to any supernatural defense but packed up and decided to leave for home. It was said that the ghost continued to chase him and haunted him to death shortly after.87 What would happen if one sought help from religious practitioners without knowing that the demonic haunting he or she had suffered actually came from a vengeful ghost? Would the vengeful ghost be expelled and the culprit saved from retribution accordingly? The answer is no, because retribution seemed to be very difficult to alter by any secular or religious means. Take Cai Juhou 蔡居厚，the prefect of Qingzhou 青州（Shandong)，for example.88 Hoping to cure the ulcer that had recently developed on his back，he invited Daoist practitioners to conduct a purification ceremony with a petition written by Mr. Wang，a close friend of his. Unfortunately, not only did he die within a few days，but Wang also died unexpectedly soon after. Not until a few days later, when Wang was released by the underworld authority and revealed what he had learned during his underworld journey, was the puzzle of their deaths unraveled. Wang explained that Cai's ulcer and his ensuing demise were retribution for his ruthlessly killing five hundred bandits who had sur rendered a year earlier, which was confirmed by Cai's spouse. Wang's own death resulted from his composing a false petition for Cai to deceive Heaven. Yet because Wang had never intended to do so, the underworld authorities spared his life and sent him back to the living world. This event shows that any attempt to interfere in the working of causal retribution might lead to grave consequences. Actually, many priests shared the assumption that vengeful ghosts were difficult to exorcise，and perhaps should not be exorcised unless their injustices received proper correction. Therefore，faced with vengeful ghosts，they were inclined to retreat and accept 87. Yijian zhi, ding, 2. 554. 88. Yijian zhi, yiy 6. 232.</page><page sequence="32">120 that the demonic forces in question were not suppressible.v; The reaction of Sun Shidao 孫士道，the military inspector (xunjian 巡檢）of Fuzhou 福州 (Fujian) and also a master of great renown for ritual healing, is typical.9,1 He was summoned to cure a judicial commissioner s (fixing 提幵【j) sister-in-law, who had been possessed and for years constantly shouted curses at the judi cial commissioner. After a close examination, Sun found that the possessing ghost had come to revenge herself on the judicial commissioner, who had unjustly killed her whole family. Though he was adept in the use of magic arts, Sun confessed that his techniques were useless in this case and firmly declined any further attempt to cure her. It is said that the possessed woman did not recover until the judicial commissioner died. In this case, too, the sense of guilt，the belief in unalterable retribution, and the exorcists’ reactions together contributed to the literati's acceptance of their retribution without much resistance. Recourse to Mundane Means Compared to the general public, the Song literati seemed to occupy a more advantageous position in fighting against evil spirits because they could resort to various political, moral, or intellectual measures to which ordinary people had little access. One such method was to use the political authority with which each local governor was invested and military force with which he was equipped. Although local administrators mainly used these powers to suppress demonic forces that assaulted people under their jurisdictions, they might also employ them to expel evil spirits they themselves encountered at offices. Yue Ke 岳河(1183-1234), the grandson ofYue Fei 岳飛(1103-1142), for example, reportedly expelled five spirits from the prefectural watch tower they had occupied by using the seal of his office together with twenty well-trained soldiers. " Nevertheless, political authority and military force did not necessar 89. There were exceptions, too. Daoist priests, for instance, often were sought out to protect the living against the curse invoked by the grievance of the dead. Through ritual communications with the divine, they investigated the source of the affliction and then enlisted the aid of the gods to dispel the curse, von Clahn, The Sinister Way, 66. 90. Yijian zhi, ding, 2. 549-550. 91. Yiwen zonglu. 5. 28. For similar cases, see Shi Wei lying 釋文璧，Yu/iu qinghua 玉壶清話 (Beijing： Zhonghua shuju, 1984)，10. 98-89； and Shang Guanrong 上官融(1043-1091), Youhui tançons,反會談叢（Wanwei biecang 宛委別藏 edition), xk 下，ia-ib.</page><page sequence="33">ily yield positive results in other similar cases. As one may easily find, many Song officeholders encountered, and were haunted by, evil spirits right at the official compounds they believed were securely guarded and impenetrable to aberrant forces. Even if they defended themselves against intruding spirits with political authority and military force, misfortunes still befell them.92 Another method the Song literati appropriated for defense against demonic invasion was the personal integrity they embodied. Some literati believed that evil spirits would certainly do no harm to a righteous person, and that only those who are evil and doomed to die would be subject to demonic haunt ing.9^ Such conviction is certainly not new to the Song，yet it seems more common for the Song literati to make this sort of claim to defend against demonic assaults and other nefarious threats.94 Yet, given that many demonic occurrences did not carry any moral implication, the virtuous and the vile alike could encounter evil spirits under many different circumstances. Since the conviction that the righteous can prevail over evil is highly questionable, this method, like the preceding one, only proved to be useful in a few cases of haunted offices during the Song era.9’ The third method involved discursively refuting the practices associated with evil spirits and their supernatural power. By relegating spirits to the realm of qi 氣 and thus turning them into nothing more mysterious than processes of the natural world，96 many literati were able to show the absurdity of peoples fear of and susceptibility to them. By ascribing the power of demonic haunting to commoners’ delusions, or to a spirit medium's chicanery，they admonished others that there was no reason to be afraid of so-called demonic afflictions. Ironically, however, their actions often belied their words, as only very few 92. Yijian zhi, yi, 7. 240-241, zhigui, 6.1264; Kueiche zhi, 5. 44. 93. Kongshi zashuo, 2. 3a； Xuelin, 4.132-134. 94. A similar tendency is observable in the cases of defending against gi/-poisoning (蟲毒)， though its efficacy is not clearly documented. H. Y. Feng and J.

The answer lies in the fact that these mundane solutions served several unique functions coincident with the Song literati's needs. The concerns that the Song literati had in mind when confronted with demonic forces in the public and official domains were more complex than the mere desire to prevail over them. They also needed to consider carefully how to retain their political authority, for their ability to carry out their duty smoothly was based on this authority. It was equally important that their actions conformed to their role expectations, since any move they made under such circumstances was open to public scrutiny. These concerns and requirements were best fulfilled by the foregoing political, moral, or intellectual means. As mentioned above, these means were self-generated, so that the literati might defy evil spirits directly without the necessity to rely on religious specialists of any kind. To refrain from depending on others was a way to avoid possible erosion of their authority. Moreover, congruent with Confucian moral principles and political ideology, these means not only were acceptable to the literati, but also permitted them to maintain their public personac as politically correct Confucians. From the above discussion，it is clear that the Song literati's recourse to them could not be as simple as a spontaneous reaction, but very possibly involved a series of delicate and rational calculations. Nevertheless, the Song literati's relations with demonic forces were not confined to one specific mode, but rather constantly changed. As has already been discussed, many literati readily succumbed to the demonic afflictions put forth by the vengeful ghosts. Yet such a submissive attitude could change rapidly into hostility if they managed to eradicate aberrant forces in the public and official domains through political, moral, or intellectual methods. Their battle with evil spirits was ostensibly similar to a holy war, allowing no room for compliance or compromise. Either they successfully expelled, suppressed, 97. Li Yuanzuo 与三兀佐，the district magistrate of Yihuang 宜黃(Jiangxi), is one of the few who showed no fear of the anomalous phenomena that occurred at his office. Even though most previous and subsequent governors were too afraid to stay in the haunted room where manv people had taken refuge and died during a bandit riot, Li alone fearlessly moved in.

Although the Song literati seemed to be intolerant of demonic forces when they resorted to mundane means, uncompromising hostility rarely dominated their rela tions with evil spirits. Not infrequently were the once resolute non-believers converted into believers soon after they had personally experienced the power of the spirits.98 Moreover，as mentioned above, since none of the means they employed had any wide-ranging influence，the antagonism they pointed to thus was far from typical of the Song literati's attitude toward the demonic forces. Recourse to Supernatural Means In contrast to mundane means, a variety of supernatural methods were so popular that Song literati frequently sought out and used them to deal with demonic occurrences. The supernatural methods encompassed two major types： the esoteric arts and the use of exorcists. Theoretically, it was the lat ter who performed the former in order to solve the demon-caused troubles faced by their clients. In practice, however, many Song literati were capable of mastering some of the exorcistic arts by themselves, rather than depending on religious specialists. Boltz, for instance, noted that it was very common for Song literati to serve concomitantly in an official post and in the role of exorcist. As she demonstrated, many Song officeholders had training in Daoist exorcistic practices; those who had no relevant training called on those who did to deal with demonic occurrences." To be sure, the official privileges that Daoism received during the Song era contributed to the prevalence of Daoist exorcisms and to the presence of those who conducted them among Song officeholders. Imperial patronage and state recognition, in particular, recast Daoist practice into something that was orthodox, sacred，and powerful.100 98.

Nevertheless, the Song literati did not confine their practices to Daoist exorcism, but constantly resorted to the exorcism practices of other religious traditions as well. Buddhist and Daoist incantations were two of the exorcistic arts that Song lite rati often employed to defend themselves against diabolic forces.1"2 Extracted from individual scriptures，most incantations were so terse as to consist of only several characters (or lines of characters) that even a non-specialist could easily learn to manipulate. Though readily accessible, they were considered extremely efficacious.

Similarly, Chen Shunmin 陳舜民，asistant magistrate of Jinjiang 晉江(Fujian), drove away a wandering ghost at the post station where he stayed overnight by silently reciting the Daoist incantation of Tianpeng 天蓬.104 Using the same Daoist incantation, Liu Rong 年卯榮，the chief of assistants of the Directorate of Educa tion (guozijian xuzhang 國子監胥長)，also securely defended himself against demonic haunting at the examination hall of Lin'an (Zhejiang).105 At times，the Song literati managed to communicate with the evildoers by using some simple and convenient rites of evocation and interrogation.106 The school instructor ofYongjia 永嘉(Zhejiang), Li Zhiji 李矢口己，for instance, confidently disclosed by way of spirit writing the identity of the spirit that had been haunting his office hall.107 In 1159 when demonic phenomena repeatedly occurred in his office, Li decided to investigate the sources of the evil forces. He placed on a desk a writing brush，an inkstand, and blank papers together with a half-completed antithetical couplet in which questions about the spirits origin and reason for appearance were raised. Moreover, in order to trace the spirit's footprints, he sprinkled ashes over the ground and then securely locked the room and waited for his/her appearance. As expected，the spirit did show up and responded to his questions in great detail. The blank paper was now full of writing, though no single footprint was traceable.

Though incantations and rites of interrogation were efficacious, they were not all-powerful. The Song literati utilized them most often when demonic beings had not yet caused such tangible harm as sickness, delirium, and death. Once any of these dire afflictions occurred, assistance from religious specialists or spirit mediums usually became indispensable.108 The Song literati relied upon religious intercessors in various situations, in both official and personal affairs. Given the variety of circumstances in which exorcistic services were needed, it is important to examine whether the Song literati's choice of religious intercessors differed according to the change of demonic contexts. In other words, there might have been certain underlying principles or con cerns that helped them choose among the available intercessors of different religious traditions. As the foregoing discussion of mundane means revealed, legitimacy, pertinence, and efficacy were some of the major concerns that the Song literati had in mind when dealing with haunted offices and demonic forces in public domains. As far as legitimacy was concerned, Daoist and Buddhist specialists were more acceptable than other practitioners, such as shamans (wu 巫),lw dur ing the Song era. The disparity of their official status was closely connected to a series of religious reforms and policies enacted from the Five Dynasties (907-960) through the Song era. As is well noted, wu masters had been play ing such significant roles as imperial physicians, diviners, and ritual masters since ancient times that emperors and royal clans accorded great favor and privilege to them.110 Yet, their lofty status began to wane as the imperial 108. Su Shi's 蘇喊(1037-1101) case was exceptional. He saved his daughter-in-law from de monic affliction on one occasion, and his grandson's nanny on another all by himself.

The Song state went a step further by depriving wu masters of their legitimacy entirely. Not only were they dismissed from the imperial court for good, but their magic practices—magic healing in particular—in local society were also condemned as pernicious and thus prohibited.112 Buddhist and Daoist clergy，in contrast, gained legitimacy in the roles once occupied by wu masters, and won the favor of the imperial court from time to time. The legitimate status of religious specialists did matter under certain circumstances. For example, in their public life the Song literati were often preoccupied with whether their religious practices suited the outlook of，and seemed proper for，an educated official. Because of this concern, Daoist and Buddhist practitioners became preferable alternatives for detecting，call ing out，and exorcising the demons encountered in the public and official domains. Conversely, wu masters, who had been denounced as illicit by the government and subjected to official suppression, were least consulted under the same circumstances. There is ample evidence of the exorcistic role of Daoist and Buddhist adepts in the public and official domains, but evidence of wu masters' service is considerably rarer.11 ' Hymes, for instance, notes that the illegitimacy of wu masters had greatly deterred the Fuzhou 撫州(Jiangxi) elite from contact with them, or at least compelled the elite to conceal any evidence of association with them. For，as he points out, "no arawareta Tôdai no fu no shokunô『太平廣記』丨二务t唐代乃巫幻職能，” Taishôdaigaku daigakuin kenkyu ronshu 大正大學大學院研究論集 u (1988): 145-156. 111. Except for performing the rituals of praying for rain, wu masters could no longer exert any influence in the imperial court. Accordingly, their major clientele gradually shifted from the ruling class to the ruled. Although they remained influential to the southern regimes, by the time the Song had reunified China they were prohibited. Nakamura, Chugoku shamanizumu, 69-84. 112.

However，for the Song literati to conform their conduct to accepted dogma in certain situations was by no means tantamount to discounting other con cerns in their minds under all circumstances. Actually, except in the public sphere, the Song literati hardly treated the legitimacy of religious specialists as their primary concern. Instead, they were most concerned about their effi cacy and pertinence in dealing with a given problem. As legitimacy became secondary, such unorthodox and prohibited spirit mediums as wu masters became temporarily free from stigmatization and exclusion. So long as they were given credit for solving demonic afflictions, they would be no less com petitive than other religious practitioners in the market for exorcistic services. The Song literati did indeed consult wu masters as much as they beseeched other spirit intercessors for help in the private sphere, regardless of the wu masters' illegitimate status. Few of them had qualms about consulting spirit mediums.丨丨’ Evidence of the Song literati's pragmatic attitude toward spirit mediums is best found in the cases dealing with demon-caused illness. The belief that demons could cause illness has a long history. Such possession disorders as zhonge 中惡(attack by noxious agents) and gueiji 鬼擊(assault by demons) had been recognized in classical medicine since the first millennium.116 Relevant therapies were not confined to the use of drugs,11 but were often accompanied by various kinds of ritual practices to ward off the demons in 114. Hymes，Statesmen and Gentlemen, 185. 115. There were very few cases in which the educated person consulted the wu. Their reluc tance to do so was not because wu masters and their practices were outlawed, but because the evil spirits involved might be their deceased kin. They were afraid that the exorcistic arts the wu practiced would hurt their loved ones. Yijian zhi, zhijing, 5. 918. 116. Paul U. Unschulcl, Medicine in China： A History of Ideas (Berkeley： University of Cali fornia Press, 1985), 29-50. 117. A good number of natural or man-made drugs including aromatics, prepared animals or parts of animals, herbs and other materials had been prescribed for curing demon-caused ill nesses. Additionally, Chinese physicians often utilized acupuncture to heal demonic afflictions. For detailed analyses, see (Jnschuld, Medicine in China, 37-45.</page><page sequence="41">129 volved.118 Though the Song state made deliberate attempts to suppress such healing practices，and a split between scholarly and popular medical tradi tions began to occur,1,9 exorcistic healing remained influential throughout the era. One manifestation of their vitality was that similar descriptions and prescriptions of demonic affliction were still ubiquitous in Song medical texts and in the realm of therapeutic practices.120 Moreover, the number of people who claimed to be experts in ritual healing also significantly increased to the point where ritual healers no longer were confined to the exorcists of certain religious traditions. Rather，motivated by the rapid increase in the demands for demonic healing, almost all kinds of religious practitioners of that era threw themselves into the business.121 The prevalence of demonic beliefs and healing practices cannot be ascribed solely to the superstition of the uneducated masses, as the Song literati often contended. Rather, this phenomenon was generated by a deep-seated convic tion of the power of demonic affliction held in common by the educated elite and the illiterate masses. An examination of the Song literati's medical prac tices reveals that they not only were important patrons of contemporary ritual healing, but also displayed an eclecticism typical of lay people seeking help 118.

Daoist priests, wu masters, and some Buddhist monks had been active in ritual healing before the Song era. Yet，during the Song，priests of such established religions as Buddhism and Daoism, and many folk practitioners (such as wu masters, itinerant magicians, ritual masters, diviners, and even some Confucian-educated persons) all claimed to have exorcistic abilities.

As evident in their own testimonies, when strange illness befell thern, many Song literati anxiously consulted ritual specialists known for exorcism and healing just as the illiterate masses did. Though some literati did so only after medical doctors failed to cure the particular illnesses, many others immediately turned to spirit mediums for help. In either case, to those in need the religious background of the spirit mediums mattered less than the mediums ability to deal with the given physical or mental disorder. If one religious specialist failed to exorcise the evil spirits in question, the literati kept consulting others who had training in different ritual techniques until either the sick regained health or all available options were exhausted.1:2 Chen Zihui 陳子輝，the controller-general of Nanxiong 南雄（Guang dong), turned to a famous Daoist ritual master for aid after doctors and wu masters failed to cure his daughter, who had lost consciousness unexpectedly at a family party.m Using a ritual seal and a rite of invocation, this Daoist suc cessfully identified the possessing spirit and then healed the girl. In another case, Tao Tuan 陶彖，the district magistrate ofjiaxing (Zhejiang), went directly to religious practitioners for help when his son fell sick and began to behave strangely.124 At first, Tao summoned various \vu masters to perform numer ous rites of exorcism in hopes that they could bring his son back to normal. Unfortunately, all of them failed to accomplish this task. Tao then solicited help from a Buddhist ritual master equally renowned for ritual healing who finally cured his son of sexual addiction to a female ghost. In a third case, an educated man tried very hard to find the cause of his daughter's sudden delirium by seeking out everyone known for quelling demonic forces.12' It is reported that wu masters, Daoist priests, and whoever claimed to be expert in the rites of exorcism had all been sought out to heal her through the years. 122. Davis suggests that decisions regarding the employment of religious specialists, especially healers, generally varied according to "hierarchies of proximity and expense." Davis, Society and the Supernatural, 138. But, in their choice of therapists, the Song elite seemed not necessarily to follow the pattern that Davis suggests. 123. Yijian zhi, ding, 5. 574-575. 124.

Though various kinds of practitioners emerged who had reputations for exorcising aberrant forces，none of them could guaran tee triumph. Therefore, the Song literati and the illiterate alike constantly tried various ritual techniques. To be sure, some literati made great efforts to propagate medical therapies and suppress the ritual healing practices prevalent among the lay people. However, most of them were as significant clients of contemporary therapeutic exorcists as commoners were. In private, the literati's patronage of ritual healers often subverted the repressive actions they took in public and thus contributed to the persistence of ritual therapies.127 Explana tions of the prevalence of ritual therapies in the Song would be incomplete if one ignored the crucial role the Song literati played in the promotion and verification of demonic forces and the rites of exorcism. 126. This five-word incantation "qianyuan hengli zhen 乾元亨禾貞” is a term derived from the hexagram # î Qian 乾 of the Yijing 易經(The Book of Change) which was composed over the early centuries of the first millennium b.c.e. The meaning of this phrase underwent several changes, from an indication of the easy consultation of the Book to four qualities associated with gentlemen. For the evolution of its meaning, see Kidder Smith, et al” Sung Dynasty Uses of the IC fling (Princeton： Princeton University Press, 1990)，8. The exorcistic power of this phrase had already appeared in the Tang (618-906), as a high-ranking official，Fu Yi 傅突，used it to defeat the magic arts performed by a non-Han Buddhist monk. Because this monk tried to menace Chinese people with the magic art of spurting fire from his mouth, Fu Yi decided to launch a counterattack. Fu told the Tang emperor Gaozu 高祖(r. 618-626) that this monk was a real saint if his magic fire could cause harm to Fu. In order to examine the power of this monk, Gaozu had these two people confront each other. Soon after the monks fire touched him, Fu chanted this five-word incantation. Miraculously, the flame went backward and burned the monk to death. For more details, see Sawada, Chûgoku no juhô, 489. This five-word phrase may be perceived as a “Confucian” form of incantatory power. For more similar cases, see Wang Zhangwei 王章 偉，ILai guojia yu shehui zhijian： Songdai wuxi xingyang yanjiu 在國家與社會之間：宋代巫 親信仰研究（Hong Kong： Zhonghua shuju, 2005), 139-195. 127. Certainly, the favor shown by the literati toward ritual healing at the expense of medical treatment was not free from criticism. See, for examples, Minggong shupan qingmingji 名公書 判清明集(Beijing： Zhonghua shuju, 1987)，14. 547-548; and Zhang Bangji 張邦基(?-after 1150)，Mozhuang manlu 墨莊漫錄(Baihai 稗海 edition), 6. 116. Yet, such criticism may serve to confirm the wide-ranging acceptance of ritual healing practices among the elite circle.</page><page sequence="44">1 32 LIAO HS 丨 EN-HUEI Conclusion The demonic images of ghosts and their destructive impact on human life were not new inventions of the Song era，but had long existed in Chinese history. They can be traced as far back as the pre-imperial period. Yet it is noteworthy that the literati's relations with, and attitude toward，the denizens of the spirit world underwent significant changes during the Song that distinguish it from earlier periods. These changes did not result irom the triumph of a revived Confucianism as the intellectual creed of the elite, nor can they be attributed to state policies designed to control the spirit world. Philosophical refutation of the supernatural power of the unseen world and regulatory authority over it accounts for only one dimension of the Song literati's relations with ghosts and spirits. Many Song literati, like their commoner counterparts, not only clearly recognized the power of the unseen world, but also encountered many circumstances under which they fell prey to evil spirits. Though as susceptible to demonic assault as the illiterate masses，because of their unique socio-political status the Song literati encountered some demonic afflictions distinctive to their roles and coped with adversity differently. Since demonic occurrence was frequently a social and political construct, the Song literati's reaction to aberrant forces was also largely determined by the sociopolitical contexts within which they were situated. Judicial pressure, a mobile lifestyle, and the examination culture all gave rise to encounters with ghosts unique to the literati. Moreover, classical knowledge, political authority，and Confucian ideology provided them with more alternatives to deal with demonic forces, but also imposed more restraint as well. It is reasonable to say that the Song literati and their illiterate counterparts shared the same beliefs in the power of spirits and both played significant roles in shaping the contemporary con figuration of the demonic. However, it is crucial to recognize that there were also evident distinctions between the Song literati's religious practices and those of ordinary people.12、 Finally, a comparison of the Song literati's contact with the divine and demonic beings raises a question as yet unanswered.129 Why did they often 128. See Liao Hsien-huei, "Visualizing the Afterlife," for à similar approach. 129. For the Song literati's contact with the divine, see Hansen, Changing Gods, 79—104, 128-159； Liao Hsien-huei 廖咸惠，"Qiqiu shenqi： songdai keju kaosheng de chongbai xingvvei yii minjian xim-ang祈求神啓:宋代科舉考生的崇拜行爲與民間信仰，” Xin shixue新史學 15. 4 (2004)： 4】~92.</page><page sequence="45">133 need a religious mediums assistance to deal with ghosts and evil spirits, while similar intercessors were not necessary in their contact with gods? More specifically, what made the Song literati confident about their ability to com mand deities，130 make deals with them，131 or claim superiority over them，132 yet unable to exert similar leverage over demonic beings? If gods and ghosts emanate from the same system (i.e., the supernatural world), as customarily depicted, why would the Song literati deal with them in a totally different manner? There might be various explanations, but the most important one is that the Song state had deliberately reshaped the spirit world by drawing a line of demarcation between the divine and the demonic. Those spirits categorized as meritorious and divine were incorporated into the register of sacrifices and had official titles and state recognition conferred upon them.1" As members of the official hierarchy, these deities not only enjoyed various kinds of privileges, but also had to conform to the behavioral norms that every official was obliged to follow. They had to serve the needs of the state, obey the hierarchical order, and bring collective welfare to the populace. In doing 130. For example, Zhou Wang 周望，the pacification commissioner (xuanfushi 宣撫使） of the Liangzhe Circuit 兩浙路(Zhejiang and Jiangsu), threatened to bum down the temple of Ma'an Shan 馬鞍山 if the enshrined god failed to assist him in finding a lost official seal.

Ouyang Xiu, for instance, made a deal with the god of Shashan、沙山，an efficacious god at Longgang 捐■岡(Jiangxi). He promised to reward the god if it helped bring forth clear skies under which he could smoothly perform a funeral ceremony for his mother.

In contrast to the docile and meritorious deities, ghosts and evil spirits were so unruly that they constantly caused trouble for, and harm to, the living world. Since they did not conform to the standards of the Song state s recognition and incorporation of deities and spirits，they were labeled as “heterodox，” excluded from official sacrifices, and subjected to official suppression from time to time. Ironically, however, when they became outsiders, ostracized from the social and political structure, they also escaped the obligations and ethical norms associated with any fixed position in the human world, and thus became unpredictable and uncontrollable. Furthermore, without the reciprocal ties to the state and officials that most divine beings had, ghosts and evil spirits appeared to be more threatening and capricious in the eyes of most Song literati. Only through the power of the hierarchically superior beings in the spirit world could ghosts and evil forces be kept under control. This is part of the reason why the Song literati's confidence and sense of superiority largely diminished when they encountered evil spirits, and why they frequently relied on religious specialists to handle demonic occurrences.</page></plain_text>
