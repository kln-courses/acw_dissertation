<plain_text><page sequence="1">A New Baby Comes. Julian May. 40 pp. $3.95. Creative Educational Society, Mankato, Minn. 56001. 1970. (Grades 4-6) A simple, clear story is told about the develop- ment and birth of a baby without the usual anthropomorphic reasoning, and "birds and bees" language. The illustrations by Brendan Lynch are realistic and appealing. An inter- ested teacher could read it effectively to first- grade pupils if the illustrations are used and the difficult terms explained. M. F. Vessel</page></plain_text>
