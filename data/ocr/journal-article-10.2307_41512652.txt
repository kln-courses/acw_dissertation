<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philip L. Greene ESTABLISH YOUR CREDENTIALS When Saul Klein arrived from the Bronx, Riverdale to be exact, to start Iiis own practice on lower Fifth Avenue, he felt that he had broken an iron ring of influence. Free at last, he was ready to dilute his rancor with compassion. But no, his parents pursued him, sweeping down from the North to inundate him with food and advice. "Here, Solly, my special gefilte fish." "Now Saul, I think you ought to have a receptionist. It doesn't look good, people lying on the couch." Fur stole trailing, smoke billowing, they trapped him in his lair. In disbelief each time, Saul roared at them, "I'm thirty-three, I'm not your sonny boy any more. Are you too stupid to understand that?" "Meyer, why are you so awful to the boy?" "I want you to stop and consider, son, get your doctor of philosophy. Close the office. Here, I'll write you a check." Meyer Klein would sit down, unscrew his ancient Waterman, slowly knock the long ash from his Bering special, and open the check book. "Are you out of your mind, Pop ? I'm making SI 5,000 a year. I don't need your money." His father would launch into the up-from-slavery tale. "When Sam Rothman and I went into partnership. . ."</page><page sequence="2">92 TRANSATLANTIC REVIEW 26 Saul would sit, venom-eyed, silent, while his father paced the floor, waving his cigar, and his mother, bored, would undermine the story with short firecrackers: "You fell into it," "Sam had all the brains," "I owned that piece of property, not you." Meyer would say, pulling out a ten dollar bill, "I got money to burn. I can light cigars with these. T oday in the world you must have credentials. ' ' The word was powerfully caressed. "Take a piece of advice, my son. Establish your credentials." Saul tried to prevent them from coming, but they stole in at odd hours, Friday mornings at eleven their speciality, just before Meyer Klein headed downtown to his broker. "More important he should meet a nice girl. That Sheila whatever her name is, is common as dirt." "That would be nice," his father would concede, and the morning air became foul with doting. He wondered if his parents could conceive of the image he projec- ted outside the family circle - self-assured, naturally wise, intensely personal. But they saw none of that. They suspected him of play-acting. He was still the little boy romping in the over-sized living room - the palazzo, Saul called it - where he played hide and seek under the mon- strous hand-carved Victorian couch. "Why don't you take one of the spare rooms for your work ?" his mother urged. "What good are those rooms? It's such an empty house. Since Milton left it's quiet like a morgue." They would get on the subject of Saul's older brother, the inevitable tears, the promises exacted to do this or that - induce Milton to come home from Paris, get his degree, meet a nice girl, eat his mother's fish - and then the hearty admonitory farewells, his father already looking distantly toward his broker. When they left, Saul would gather himself for his other life, the darkened apartment-office, the elaborate high fidelity system piping Vivaldi into the foyer, the low-keyed, somnabulistic probings of his patients: "Why do you think that?" "How do you feel about that?" "Does that bother you?" Saul loved the soothing authority of his voice, the neutral tones edged with sympathy, the slow march of reason pressing toward the shock of recognition. Above his bed, alongside a Piranesi print, a blowup of Freud gazed down at him. The master, in his last years, displayed a vigorous beard and firm, wise eyes that brazenly hid his ravaged insides. Ðž wise father, Saul wanted to intone, but he was afraid that Freud might speak back in rebuke. He recalled Alicia's jibe about the cult of personality. Freud would be'the first to slap down Saul's anthropomorphism. Hadn't Saul read Moses and Monotheism ? The therapeutic dangers of quasi-religious sanctions had already threatened the profession. Of course, Alicia was right. Right-minded orthodoxy in a forty-four year old lady medical doctor psychoanalyst -</page><page sequence="3">PHILIP L. GREENE 93 a formidable combination of powers. His forty-four year old girl. But what did age matter. Age dissolves in the world of ideas. In bed Alicia seemed ageless. She became a coquette, a temptress, an active bundle of normal feminine complexes. Saul loved this in her, the ability to wash away every taint of careeritis and submit to the gross hungers of the flesh. But at the same time it bothered him. Her age did show. She loved too desperately, too consciously. He ended up by taking her punishingly. He was not aware of his abusive tactics until one night, after a particularly bad time in bed, Alicia pointed out a pattern in his actions. They had gone to the movies, a foreign film at the Art , heralded for its frank handling of sex, and Saul had boisterously declared on the sidewalk, with the Village crowd streaming by, that her criticism of the movie was based on personal motives, that obviously she was suspicious of the relationship portrayed, which happened to be about a young man in love with an older woman. "It's not the first time that has happened," she said, as they lay smoking cigarettes in the darkened room. "On every social occasion, before sex, you find some excuse for picking an argument. Last week at the Taubers you accused me of blindness toward abstract art. Do you remember how you acted?" "You are imagining things. It's your own hostility to the Taubers that set you off. Anyway, if it's true it's probably a coincidence. Was it so bad tonight?" "It wasn't bad, but it isn't good either. You are. . .leaping at me." Marvin and Belle Tauber were critical of Saul's relationship with Alicia. Marvin, himself a temperate, methodical man, saw her as a disruptive force in Saul's life. Alicia was bright, tenacious, a compulsively dominant type. She wanted to use her age as a weapon to delay Saul's career. Belle Tauber, a bony-faced, high-strung woman of opinions, dismissed the age difference as inconsequential. Belle was positive that Alicia exploited her sex. Alicia most certainly was manipulating Saul's passion. Belle questioned Alicia's success, falsely based on the pleasure her patients found in the intimate surroundings of a pretty woman. Belle imagined that they kept returning with the hope that an affair would develop. The Taubers had purchased a large oil by an unknown, which Alicia had found wanting in grace. Alert to the Taubers' esthetic uncertainties. Saul jumped to the defense. "That's a tired statement. It's an action painting. The grace, if you want to call it that, lies in its dynamic rush of color. I mean if you want pleasant, scented colors and forms, that's your problem." "I'm bored with non-representational things, that's all." "But this is a very human kind of thing. It's a canvas of the psyche." "Saul dear, you can't always drag your trade into other areas. I see random splashings hoping to find a form. It's as simple as that."</page><page sequence="4">94 TRANSATLANTIC REVIEW 26 "Why must you be superior? This is a beautiful painting. You just refuse to understand it. Why do you always wave things away? You wave a hand and everything disappears. Abstract art. No good. Wave away. Shazam. Wave. Good-bye." Boiling with anger, he took Alicia home, and it was as she had said, he had stormed at her, punishing her with what. . .with self-contempt? Alicia's comment about Saul's violence stirred in him real doubts about their relationship. He took her with a ferocity he had assumed was an energetic expression of love. The more he wrenched at her body, the greater his desire mounted. She lay under him thrashing, flushing love's juices, her eyes pinpoints of passion. Or so he thought. But perhaps she was right. Perhaps what he thought was love was really lust, or worse, a sublimated form of hatred. It did seem true that his actions were vengeful, almost sadistic. That night he decided to sleep less frequently at Alicia's. In the year that he had the apartment he had spent most of his nights at her place, despite the inconvenience. It was a bother, late sleeper that he was, to stumble out of her house at 9 :30 in the morning, heavy with sleep and beard, drag him- self home to his apartment to ready himself for the guerrilla tactics of his parents. It had happened once. "Where were you, Saul?" his mother's voice shrilled over the phone. "We came at ten o'clock. Did you stay at a friend's house?" The sarcasm was heavy, unmistakable. He said some- thing about a party at Marvin's. He couldn't stand the lies, the subterfuge. He was a grown man. Alicia agreed to the new arrangement. Yes, it would be all right if he said so. Yes, it would be better this way. Saul left laden with guilt. In a few days he adjusted himself to the celibate life. The morning ritual was a tonic. First, the FM on. Handel swept into the apartment. Saul sang along as he quickly stripped the bed and pushed it into its couch position. One of his first patients, noticing a foldaway bed, had coyly suggested opening it so that he could analyze her, both lying down. He had avoided that one by asking her, "Will that solve something for you?" "My insom- nia," she had wisecracked, and it became a running joke each time she arrived. "My insomnia's been acting up again." Once he waited for her, ready to cure her insomnia, but luckily she called, cancelling the appoint- ment. He asked Alicia about it. How did she handle seductive patients? She pointed out that her private bed was not her public couch. She was tired of his endless rumblings about professional amours. He shufiied to the window, pulled the drapes tightly closed, blocking out a beam of sunlight cutting across the living room, put up a pot of coffee, took off his pajamas, rolled them in a ball, threw them in the closet, and stepped into the bathroom for his morning shower. He closed the door,</page><page sequence="5">PHILIP L. GREENE 95 examined himself in the full-length mirror on the door, and ripped out an aria, his voice resonant against the tiles on the wall. His patients always managed to comment on the tiles. "An all black-tile bathroom. It's a pleasure to take a crap in there," said one of his male patients. Saul was happy to supply atmosphere to a man he had diagnosed as having an anal fixation. He stepped into the sliding glass door shower stall, turned on the top jet and the six side jets. The water pinged on all his parts. He falsettoed a deep baritone, "che gelida manina le lasci rescaldare." The shower stall had won him instantly when he was apartment hunting. "You could live in this bathroom," the agent had remarked. He was right. Close the door on the world and live in resonating tile luxury. He thought of the steamy spring day when he had suggested a shower to a patient, and she had stayed in the bathroom half the session. "Physical therapy is the answer," she said afterward, as the time dissolved into a social hour. He had wondered about the ethics of that, too. Freud had no such problem. Monogamous Sigmund and his good Martha. Exemplary life. But it was exactly the instant bridging of the initial hostility that was at the heart of his success. Several of his patients had left other doctors: "We don't get along," "He's a cold fish," "I can't relate to him," "I feel like I'm being punished," "There's no contact" - and with each confession Saul would drop his voice a decibel lower, and a paternal, indulgent tone would creep in. He knew that Alicia was sharp, cool, analytical. He tried that approach de- liberately once, only to discover that he actively disliked the patient. It was his one difficult encounter, a man his own age, an advertising copy- writer who had persisted in pursuing the credentials business until Saul's patience had worn thin. "Why are you coming to me?" "Frankly, Doc, I don't know. Maybe I want somebody I can feel superior to." After the shower, a brisk rubdown with a huge bathtowel. With the towel wrapped around him locker-room fashion, a lengthy lather shave, five minutes on each side, and another five for stray hair clipping. He cleared the steam from the mirror and introduced himself to himself. "How are you, Dr. Klein?" He tried the Doctor with several intonations. "How can you call yourself Doctor?" his father's voice echoed back from the mirror. "I don't call myself anything," he answered. "They call me Doctor." His first patient that day made a point of it every time she came. On her first visit she had announced the word with great force. "You mind if I say something right away. When I heard Dr. Klein I imagined a middle- aged man, sort of fat, a kind of leftover GP. You are young." She was his only Catholic patient, Terry Bellotti, an Italian girl in her mid-twenties, a would-be actress who had had a disastrous affair with a Jewish produc- tion manager of an off-Broadway show. There had been an abortion, two suicide attempts, desperation visits to her parish priest in the East Village,</page><page sequence="6">96 TRANSATLANTIC REVIEW 26 yielding nothing but warnings to cease her dissolute life. Almost completely out of touch with religion, Saul had begun reading the Bible, and had consulted several articles on the current trend toward a reconciliation between religion and psychoanalysis. He was the only one of his group who was involved in such a case. He dressed, drank his coffee, and went downstairs for the mail. He met the mailman with a package for him. One side was crushed. Upstairs he tore it open. Cashews, almonds, brazils, from a broken jar of nuts, were scattered through the box. He pulled out the other items: ajar of borscht, a jar of gefÃ¬lte fish, a honey cake, a tin of lox, a kosher salami wrapped in aluminium foil, and a package of dates, He opened the note sticking to the honey cake. A fifty dollar check fell out. "Greetings from the Fountain Blue. Meyer is taking a Sauna bath. You need some shirts and ties. Don't argue. Shop in a nice place. Write a postcard at least. Your mother." He shoved the box into the cupboard under the sink, next to the soap powder. He put the check in the desk drawer and slammed it shut. Meyer Klein in the Sauna bath. The last Roman emperor. The phone rang. Alicia wanted to know if he had slept well. She reminded him of the theater tickets for that night. "Please don't be late this time, dear." Her voice, honeyed, ironic, pinched at his stomach. "Seven-thirty sharp," he said, and then, not wanting to, "I missed you last night." She laughed, satisfied, and hung up. The morning mood was slipping away. He didn't want Alicia, he didn't want the damned check or the lousy nuts. He went into the bathroom and boomed out the "un bel di" aria. The buzzer, incessant, cut him off. His Italian girl was at the door, slim, with wide, anxious black eyes, hair pulled back in a bun. "How are you, Dr. Klein ?" She edged into the marble-floored foyer, and put her huge bag on a chair. She asked to be excused for a moment. He heard her urinating into the bowl. "I always have to go when I get here," she giggled when she came out. "What is that playing?" she asked. He listened for a moment. "Sounds like a Mozart piano concerto," he said, annoyed that he couldn't place it at once. "Don't you listen to show music?" she asked as she sat on the couch. She had been coming for several months, each time sitting guardedly on the couch as if it would attempt to fling her into a reclining position. "I can't think lying down. I black out." This led to a recollection of her affair with the Jewish production manager. Saul kept on, quietly urging her to go beyond that experience. She cried often, talking about sin until he began persuading her to understand the idea of guilt. "I know sin is an old-fashioned word, but I killed a baby inside me. That was a mortal sin." Lately she had begun talking about her father, the strict household, the punishments for staying out late, the warnings about Hell. She laced her</page><page sequence="7">PHILIP L. GREENE 97 conversations with Sunday school messages from the Bible that Saul recognized as Pauline admonitions, punishing masculine notions of celi- bacy and chastity. The girl's father had ripped off her dress once, looking for signs of violation. After a few cigarettes and an account of her recent activities, she paused in mid-sentence. "Dr. Klein, are you really a doctor?" The question was out again, but without the usual dodging he said, "No, I'm not." "Would you rather that I was?" "No, It's hard to explain. You are so young. If you were really a doctor, then I ... You know. I think of you as my adviser. If you were really a doctor, then I. . . Well, you're so sweet. You know what I mean?" "Can't doctors be that way?" "Yes, but I like you. That's all right, isn't it? A patient can have feelings about his doctor. If I have feelings about you and you are really a doctor, then it is sort of. ..." "Sort of what?" "Well, incestuous." "How is that?" "Doctors are authority figures. I never thought about this before at all. My father and the priest are authority figures. If you are a doctor then you are an authority figure, and if I like you, I mean, have feelings about you, then I am liking an authority figure. My father, you know. I can't do that. He is my father. So if you are not a doctor I can like you. I guess I think I'm beginning to feel guilt. I think I know what you mean." She left, and with an hour before his next appointment, Saul sat over coffee thinking about the session. She had done a pretty bit of self-analysis. She had understood instinctively the terrifying, constricting, and ambiva- lent attitudes one can have about authority figures. He had read somewhere that to relinquish the image of paternalism is the first step toward psycho- therapeutic wisdom. Cut through the self-deceiving role-playing, strike for the dynamic relationship, and the analyst can make contact. She wanted him not to be a doctor (father, priest, god) so that she could like him. He wanted her to like him. She promised sweet concessions. She would not plunder his manhood, spear him with influences. Yes, if he had the degree it would give him the power to be free from the fear of power. What sort of madness forced his father (what was he, East European immigrant, shrewd manipulator of a small talent) to fancy himself king of the hill, what but the gnawing fear of power? He had aced out Sam Rothman on a Florida real estate operation with a cunning and deceit that came from some deep secret hunger so primal that it had destroyed his moral strength. Doctor, father, priest, god - a holy quartet of immortality seekers. So that's what it was. Adam and Eve ate the apple so</page><page sequence="8">98 TRANSATLANTIC REVIEW 26 god could own all the immortality - and lose all the love. Fear and revere, yes. But love ? I like you because you are not a god, the girl had said. Yet if he established his credentials he could thumb his nose at Marvin and Belle and Alicia and his parents. He could be free to make the ungodly contact. He thought he might shop around in the library. Why not a dissertation on some area like this? The subject was broad, immense, but there was much to be done. Saul went to the desk drawer, took out a slip of paper and started to jot down some titles: "Authoritarian Images in Childhood Memories of Trauma," "Memory and Perception in Tradition Centered Families." He settled on a tentative title: "The Relationship Between Delayed Identity Formation and Authoritarianism." The possibilities were there, endless variations on a vital theme. Saul felt a surge of energy. A new regimen must be mapped out. He took a sheet of paper and began to write: Monday 8 - 9 Awake, wash, eat 9 - 12 To library 1 - 7 Patients 7 - 8 Dinner and relax 8 - 10 To library Repeat throughout week. No exceptions. There were many things to do: find an adviser at the college, prepare a bibliography, discuss an outline, look at other dissertations on related material. The buzzer interrupted his meditation. He went to the door, opened it with a smile, and ushered in his next patient. It was the advertis- ing man. "Well, how am I, Doc?" he asked, as he stepped into the office. Ð¸ Saul plunged into the thesis with a fierceness that surprised himself. He slept little and ate on the run. With startling ease he put off his parents' visits. They had returned from Florida with the concealing deep tan that sharply calls attention to the aging flesh underneath. He had never seen them healthier and closer to senility. Before they could unwind with their lacklustre gossip about their geriatric playmates, Saul announced his plan. "Of course," Meyer proclaimed, white showing through the brown folds in his neck, "that's the only thing to do But remember, if you will forgive a bit of advice from your old father. Do it right. All my life I had to fight with slipshod workers. Slipshod is fake. Do you remember the houses Sam Rothman put up when he broke with me? He hasn't recovered yet from the damages against him. That's why I got rid of him. Slipshod. I send them all to hell." Saul said he would be perfection itself, but they must leave him alone. No calls, no visits. "Don't call me. I'll call you."</page><page sequence="9">PHILIP L. GREENE 99 "When do we bother you?" his mother said. "I'm too busy with my own things to run after you. Go. Write. It would be nice to have a doctor a son. I'll send you packages once in a while." Alicia was more than cooperative. She planned once-a-week dates, offered to help him with his bibliography, bought him books, and even suggested doing some of the reading, with summaries of the useful items. Saul accepted everything, hardly realizing Alicia's generosity. She began to adopt special techniques of love - preparing desperate strategies to maintain the intensity of the affair. She gave him cologne baths. "To lave me is to love me," he said, urging passion into his voice to match her insistent flesh, porous with feverish embarrassment. But his day dreams of Terry increased. He found himself substituting her image as Alicia looked up at him with needy eyes. The falseness of his role weighed unbearably on him. He burned for love. But Freud said that the character of the analyst must be irreproach- able, severe, exacting. He couldn't do it. His patients were blocks in his path. He rushed the analytic sessions along, irritated by the hours squan- dered in the apartment. He had a vision of tomorrow. He wasn't sure of the shape of the vision, but he saw it in front of him, the clicking into place of the scattered bits of his life. He daydreamed of ideas of order, the random procession of act and fact pressing harmoniously, the felt weight of his presence substantial, existent. The days and nights in the library became a romance of work, a discovered passion he flung himself at with violence. The work went grandly. In a matter of weeks he gathered stacks of biblio cards, wrote notes in a neat, sure hand, digested journals, synopsized books, narrowed and shaped his thesis idea. One night, ecstatic over a piece of evidence, he dashed to the Taubers to share the news. Marvin and Belle questioned the subject. "Too much. Too big. Pick a nice little area and knock it off," was Marvin's advice. Belle assented vigorously. "You'll be at it forever. I have seen those professional graduate students." Ordinarily Saul would attack Belle's carping criticism and Marvin's opportunism, but he was onto a truth, perhaps even Truth itself. "The Word, I may have the god-damn Word. Marvin, you went through this. Am I being a nut? It's like I'm ten feet tall. Didn't Thurstone do a study on sudden euphoria and relate it to Freudian concerns with defense formations and superego? Something like that." Marvin didn't know how to handle Saul's exuberance. It embarrassed him. Dispassionate involvement was Marvin's operating slogan. He suffered most Saul's mercurial moods, and felt that Saul eventually had to fail in the profession. Saul would depress and then he and Belle would have to help him through the withdrawal period. But Marvin's smugness seemed empty of certainty. As Saul walked home, he considered</page><page sequence="10">100 TRANSATLANTIC REVIEW 26 the way in which the image of power shifts. Marvin's adherence to forms, the most accommodating kind of usable power, now seemed meretricious; Alicia's ironic control of people and ideas was a mask for uncertainly; his parents' flaunting of money was even more vulgar than he had imagined. They were all the subtle victims of doubt and anxiety, lost to the real touch of the world around them. With the basic research done and the data assembled, Saul started on a new schedule, working late into the night, with the coffee pot going and the single lamp over his desk encircling him in a diffused halo. Over late snacks of his mother's borscht, Saul swept through the introduction. Alicia came over, read the introduction, and called it superb. "Sweetheart, this is good enough to be published. But you must watch out in the next chapters for generalization. It's a bit too impressionistic. Look at the way Erikson handles the problem of identity formation. He avoids jargon, but he doesn't get romantic. You ought to look at Marvin's thesis." "I don't want to look at Marvin's thesis. Maybe it is romantic, but I think I have something here, something original. I don't want to copy Marvin's safe view of things." "All right. But I wish it was over." Saul saw the tired look at the edge of her eyes. In the lamplight she looked worn, her carefully kept prettiness straining to dissolve. He felt distaste. "When it is over, we will shoot the works, cocktails, dinner, theater, dancing." "Would you like to come to my place?" "No. I want to work some more. Why don't you stay here?" He was trapped by pity. He saw Alicia as a patient, the confused, darting look of her eyes signalling pain and fright. He made sure she was asleep before he got into bed. When the book was finished he would make the break. He thought of Terry. She could move with him. "Give it to me now, Dr. Klein." Her analysis would soon be over. Could he risk it? "Why must you pick on that girl ? An Italienische." His mother's voice seemed to come from Alicia. Was his mother that delicate and pretty twenty years ago ? He saw Meyer and Henrietta Klein, aged sixty, acting forty, writhing on a bed. He shook away the image. Alicia was snoring lightly, her mouth open. He sat up, panic gripping his chest. "Who are you, Saul Klein ?" he said to the dark room. The writing stopped abruptly after the introduction. Sensing the break, Saul's parents resumed their visits, Alicia's calls increased, Marvin dropped over to give advice. "I can't get the hook," Saul said to them. "Maybe it's too big for me. Maybe I'm dry." He saw them smile at him, pity running out of their eyes, their hermetic centres of power undisturbed for a little</page><page sequence="11">PHILIP L. GREENE 101 while longer. Saul sat and listened to them, trying to decide whether he was a failure or they were trying to destroy him. "I have an idea, don't you see?" he said once to his parents, his tone hovering between a threat and a plea. "But I'm blocked. It will work itself out." "Take your time, Saul," his father counseled. "Rome wasn't built in a day. Don't I remember those early days before I met your mother, when I worked for Seidman, chasing after two-bit prospects without a nickel in my pocket for carfare or a bowl of soup? Take your time. And if you don't write it. . . . Is it so awful? You can always come in with me. We all make mistakes." "I want to make my own mistakes, Pop," Saul said. He felt that this scene had been repeated before, the time he went away to school in Michi- gan and came back to face his parents with the news of his failure. It was in this very room. But that was impossible. He remembered too the abortive half year at UCLA, the plane zooming there and back before he had a chance to burn his eyes in the smog. How many mistakes does a man make ? Terry came into view. "I like you, Dr. Klein." The proof was there, in his patients. They loved him. They respected him. "Are you really a doctor?' Couldn't they believe him? Alicia had bought him a tape recorder for his birthday. An authentic love gift. He had it all here, down on tape, material proof from his sessions. Saul decided to go back to the library for more evidence. Something might hit him, end his confusion, point him forward again. He read and re-read everybody. While managing each afternoon to meet his patients, he sat slackly, his mind drifting, barely keeping with the talk. In the middle of his session with Terry the phone rang. Alicia, excited, said she had discovered something that he could use. That night at her place Saul read through a volume from 1864, an early treatise on phrenology and character formation, with a long section on dominant types. "This guy is remarkable," Saul said. "I haven't seen this material any- where. Where did you find it?" "In the stacks at the library. I have been going over there." "You're doing my homework." "As far as I know no modern psychologist has referred to it. Of course it is dated, but you can incorporate much of it." "I suppose I could use it. But I'm still not sure how it could fit in with my thesis." "If you arrange your thesis around some of the material in here, this book could form the foundation. Make some changes here and there. If you are worried about the ethics of it, you must remember that we all borrow from the past. The idea is to get through, isn't it?" "But it isn't my work any more. I would be faking it. Haven't we had</page><page sequence="12">102 TRANSATLANTIC REVIEW 26 enough of that kind of talk ? I want my signature on the work. That has got to mean something. Or am I kidding myself? I mean, do you think I'm kidding myself? I can't tell any more." He waited while Alicia paused to form a reply. He saw the hesitation. "You do think it, don't you? You talk to Marvin on the phone about the Problem of Saul. Saul keeps his quiet little pad and makes his tapes and tries to make a reality of his illu- sions. Isn't that it ? Don't I know me well enough ? And don't give me that bullshit about having faith in my accomplishments. What does that mean in the real world? Here is a book. I will 'write my thesis around it' and I will be Dr. Klein, stamped, certified, embossed on vellum. And you look at me with your stamped and certified medical degree, and you know that we are certified lovers. I'm sorry if I sound like a nut, but what am I certifying?" "I don't know." Alicia's voice was very soft. "Am I any better because I have what I have? I am forty-four years old, and I want you to love me." "Please don't burden me with that. How do I know what I am loving?" "Sweetheart, don't destroy yourself. Your angst is tiresome." "I may be dead in ten years." "Take the book home and read it. Perhaps it will give you an idea, a way in. Is that so terrible?" "O.K. I'll read. I'll call you tomorrow. But you ought to start thinking of putting me on your couch instead of in your bed." Saul read the book, put it away for several days, picked it up again, put it away. He hid it in the closet behind his old 78's, and turned back to the thesis. The introduction was good, but perhaps he had said it all right there. He took up the book again and made some notes. It would be easy. He could lift the thing wholesale. Who would ever know? He could get back to his patients again. The Alicia thing would end. A thing was in the air with Terry. Lately she had been coming in with a dark inside look. He picked up the phone and called the Taubers. Belle answered. "Saul, what's the matter? You sound dead." He spilled out the story. He imagined Belle would be on his side. She liked to use him against Marvin. "It isn't exactly cricket, but you may be hung up on this for years." Belle was a good wife for Marvin. They always saw things in their practicality. What did differences in temperament matter as long as your moral views coincided. Saul felt washed out, his stomach hollow and rumbling. "I was thinking I ought to junk it. Start something new. I don't want to cheat." "You put things so badly, Saul. Marvin's paper is a patchwork of other people's ideas. There isn't an original thought in it. But it is a decent piece of work. Use the book. Don't copy it" "It's crazy. Can't you tell me the truth?"</page><page sequence="13">PHILIP L. GREENE 103 "What truth?" "That it is all wrong. Do you feel obliged to me because you and Marvin steered me into this whole business? What is all this crap about taped sessions and Saul's insights? For God's sake, I'm living a lie every minute." "What are you punishing yourself for?" The tone was placating, but Belle had a way of throwing all the guilt in one direction. She liked Saul but she was a critic. "I'm punishing myself because of a compulsion to rid myself of an Oedipal fixation. How the hell do I know what I'm punishing myself for?" They talked for a few more minutes and Saul hung up, not listening to anything but the Bach organing out of the FM. Violently hungry, he sat down to his mother's borscht and fish, turned off all the lights except for the desk lamp, waited for the music to sweep through the room, rolled up his sleeves, and began typing. In the morning he called all his patients and cancelled his appointments for the week. He bought several jars of borscht and fish, came home, bolted the door, cut the telephone wires, and worked through the night. The next day he went to the corner drugstore and called everybody. "I will not be available for several days. The phone is out of order. Do not visit." At the end of the week he had smoothed out his introduction, fitting it into the context of the phrenology book, copied out the long chapter on dominant types, pausing only to modernise styUstic awkwardnesses and to footnote recent works at key spots. His conclusion was completely his own. It flowed onto the paper as effortlessly as the introduction. When he finished he announced loudly to the room: "I am the master of beginnings and endings. I leave the great middle for the world to discover. I am a man of enigmatic middles." He restored the phone service, called his parents, Alicia, and Marvin and Belle, and invited them to a party to celebrate the completion of his thesis. He submitted the manuscript to his adviser, who called Saul a few days later, calling it a fine piece of work, unusual, highly original, a genuine contribution to the field. At the party Saul read selected portions to his audience. His parents sat quietly in the corner, with disbelieving eyes. Alicia looked proudly at Saul. Marvin and Belle listened with attentiveness. That night, long after everyone had gone, he called Terry. He wanted to see her at once. She yielded to him completely, all traces of her recent trauma gone. Saul tore at her bony structure, devouring her. But in the middle of the night, he leaped from her bed and sped to Alicia's house. * 'I have a package from my mother. Borscht and fish. Will you join me ?" In the hum of the quiet apartment, with the slanting of the new light, they sat, silently, partaking of their last supper.</page></plain_text>
