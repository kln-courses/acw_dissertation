<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bare Life, Vidas secas Or; Como se morre no cinema1 Rachel Price Este artigo examina um curta de 2002, intitulado Como se morre no ci nema e dirigido por Luelane Loiola Correa, que toma como ponto de partida o filme Vidas secas (1963) de Nelson Pereira dos Santos. Como se morre no cinema focaliza nossa atençào em temas centrais tanto ao filme de Pereira dos Santos como ao romance epônimo de Graciliano Ramos, mas que sao frequentemente eclipsados por leituras que tomam ambas as produçôes como ilustraçôes de urna familia pobre de retirantes. Em particular, Como se morre no cinema chama a atençào sobre a importância de urna filosofía extra-humanista e bicho-céntrica presente em ambas as versöes de Vidas secas. Eu argumento que a presença dos animais -e, mais precisamente, da morte dos animais- no romance e no filme resulta imprescindível para enten der também as suas preocupaçôes formais e genéricas, e é 0 que tem levado a ambas as versöes de Vidas secas a ser classificadas como obras sem género fixo: ao mesmo tempo experimental (ou modernista) e realista. Concluo que a preocupaçâo sobre a representaçâo da morte da cachorra Baleia -central ao romance, ao filme e ao curta- demonstra como os desafios filosóficos de representar a subjetividade e a consciéncia animal estäo na raiz da estética ocidental, fazendo central a questäo de "como se morre no cinema"para se imaginar urna estética extra- ou pós-humanista. In 2005 New Yorker Films released a DVD edition of Vidas secas, Nelson Pereira dos Santos' 1963 classic from Cinema Novo's first phase, adapted from Graciliano Ramos' eponymous 1938 novel.2 In both the novel and the film—a fairly faithful transposition of the book—not much happens. Both 146 Luso-Brazilian Review 49:1 ISSN 0024-7413, © 2012 by the Board of Resents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">Price L4/ are often summarized as depictions of the barren, impoverished lives or a family of retirantes in the arid sertäo. Wandering across the desert, the fam ily temporarily makes a home in an abandoned farm, where it cares for a landowner's cattle and enjoys an austere version of domestic stability before a new drought drives it to migrate again towards a big city in hopes of a better life. The family of poor-devils, as one critic called them,3 is accompa nied by their faithful dog, Baleia, and, initially, by a parrot, who is quickly killed and eaten in the first scenes of both book and film.4 The animalization of humans is matched by Ramos' and Pereira's moving portraits of a dog's consciousness, the suggestion being that at the limit of life—what Giorgio Agamben might term bare life, or that life deprived of any political agency and reduced to mere survival—animal and human approach one another.5 At least, this is how Vidas secas has often been read: as depicting the bestial ization of impoverished humans, and the humanization of Baleia. But the radicalness of both the genre-bending novel and the cinema novo film lies precisely in both genres' attempts to depict a subjectivity beyond human ism, beyond the human. Typical readings of the novel and film as offering humanizing, it decid edly unsentimental representations of nordestina life was given a new twist by an extra included in the 2005 DVD edition of the film. Along with now standard features in which the director, actors and invited speakers com ment on the film, the edition includes a discrete twenty minute short mixing present-day interviews with the film crew with humorous reenactments of the filming of Vidas secas. Shot in parts to look like an old, 16 mm film, the award-winning Como se morre no cinema [translated as Baleia the Dog, or How One Dies in the Cinema], directed by Luelane Loiola Corrêa, is a comi cal "making of" Vidas secas, framed ingeniously by narration from a (very much alive, it turns out) parrot, and emphasizing the extra-diegetic life of Baleia, the surprise star of Cannes when the film premiered at the French festival in 1964.6 By focusing on the historical animal rights furor over the presumed on screen death of Baleia (which was in fact staged), Como se morre no cinema obliquely but importantly focuses the contemporary reception of Vidas se cas on the intersection of several philosophical questions foregrounded in both novel and film, questions which nevertheless have not perhaps gar nered sufficient critical attention. Como se morre no cinema highlights the ways in which animal subjectivity, language, death, (filmic) representation and debates over realism converge in a dense, compounding nexus. It calls attention to a crucial perspective often eclipsed by retirante-centered read ings of the novel and film: namely, that both film and novel remain profound</page><page sequence="3">14B Luso-Brazilian Review 49:1 meditations on the relations between animality and humanity, speech and silence, and in so doing pose questions about the nature of animal subjec tivity and theatricality.7 In this article, I analyze the ways in which Como se morre no cinema sheds light on the novel and feature-length film, to better address the following question: what is it about questions of the human/ani mal divide—and specifically, about representations of animal death—that creates aesthetic, generic innovation? The Mute Papagaio Como se morre no cinema begins as a story told by a parrot to its owner, a former migrant from Paraiba now living in a Rio apartment. The bird an nounces that, long ago, it was a film star. The man laughs at his pet incredu lously. A film star? He's not so stupid as to believe a bird could be the star of a film. The parrot dismisses these objections: "Chico, nâo entende nada do Cinema Novo!" As the parrot suggests, early Cinema Novo, with its an titheatrical and ascetic influences from Italian neorealism and an "estética da fome," blurred the line between objectivity and subjectivity, acting and "life," the human and inhuman (or subhumano). Why indeed should a bird not be the star of a Cinema Novo film?8 The parrot then launches into the history of Vidas secas, beginning with an account of his own miraculous existence. Interspersing faux "behind the scenes" shots with scenes from the actual 1963 Vidas secas, Como se morre no cinema soon cuts to the arresting scene in Pereira's film in which Sinhá Vitoria, played by Maria Ribeiro, stares glumly at the family parrot and squats below an infernal sun, the family malnourished and one son all but left for dead by Vitorias husband Fabiano. Food must somehow be procured or the family will perish. The parrot, one of the family's few belongings—a sole instance of "property" that serves to invest the family with a modicum of bourgeois humanity—is suddenly snatched up by Ribeiro. Her face con torts with the rage that she be reduced to such actions, and with the physical effort of wringing the bird's neck. Pereira's film then cuts to Sinhá Vitoria squatting beside a fire, stoking burning embers that heat the carcass of the bird skewered on a homemade spit. In Como se morre no cinema the original clip of this sequence is followed by an interview with Pereira dos Santos and Ribeiro in which director and actress vividly recall the filming of the scene some forty years before. Ri beiro had apparently not realized that she would literally, rather than merely cinematically, have to kill the bird. Pereira, impatient with Ribeiro's squea mishness, had instructed her that if killing the bird was necessary to make the scene work, then kill the bird she must. As the film began to roll, the</page><page sequence="4">Price 149 crew remained in suspense— it was a mystery. Everybody was waiting for Maria's move"—would she or wouldn't she? Neorealisms can seek an apparent transparency between subjectivity and expression; the eradication of "acting." That is, they seek an acting that is "absorbed," to use Michael Frieds concept, apparently unaware of an au dience and devoid of melodramatic conventions.9 This absorbed antithesis of acting has long been associated with animals, who are believed incapable of dissembling.10 But how is such sincere immediacy to be achieved by hu man actors: by most fully inhabiting a character, or by purging all attempts at acting? Ribeiro recalls needing to "channel" Sinhá Vitoria, to give up her own subjectivity and become the character to find the courage (or despera tion) necessary to wring the parrot's neck: "Sinhá Vitoria entrou em mini." According to Ribeiro, a struggle unto death ensued as she tried to wring the parrot's neck: "E eu e o papagaio ... Ε você nada de dizer cut'"! As Ribeiro struggled to kill the parrot, Pereira recorded it impassively, postponing the film's cut, which was effectively to mark the end of the parrot's life. The cut, as in snuff films, was therefore to transcend cinematic fiction into reality.11 Since the crew possessed only the one parrot, Pereira was resolved to cap ture the take as best he could. But, in the first of Como se morre no cinemas many surprises, the director and Maria reveal that, after Pereira finally yelled "cut," the parrot improbably righted itself and flew away to freedom, which Como se morre no cinema, playfully engaging regional narratives of migration, imagines to be Rio de Janeiro. The secret history of the animal s apparent death—in truth a mere "truque do cinema," as the parrot tells us—comments on two themes cen tral to both the novel and the film: namely, animal subjectivity, questioned in the Western philosphical tradition by the indefensible thesis that ani mals do not "die properly" because they presumably have no knowledge of death—and the value of semblance versus realism, an opposition crucial to the question of on-screen death.12 The silent struggle between Ribeiro and the parrot also allegorizes crucial themes in the book Vidas secas, in which the parrot stands in for the humans who barely speak. Upon its publication in 1938 Vidas secas was understood by some critics to be in a naturalist tradition stretching back to Eça de Queirós. But others deemed it revolutionary for its use of language (Dácio Antonio Castro has written that "desde seu lançamento, passou a ser considerado pela crítica como o ápice da mudança de rumos operada pelo Modernismo."13 The prose is spare, arid. The characters hardly speak; Ramos described the novel about "quase mudo," peasants as being "sem paisagens, sem diálogos. Ε sem amor. Nisso, pelo menos, ele deve ter alguma originalidade."14 The family's mute ness is relentlessly commented upon in the novel itself; it may indeed consti</page><page sequence="5">15° Luso-Brazilian Review 49:1 tute the single-most explored concept.15 Throughout, characters utterances are compared to the guttural sounds of animals. Thus Vitoria "afirmou com alguns sons guturais" (14); Fabiano "utilizava nas relaçoes com as pessoas a mesma lingua com que se dirigía aos brutos—exclamaçôes, onomatopéias" (23), while the youngest boy "balbuciava expressöes complicadas, repetía as sílabas, imitava os berros dos animais, o barulho do vento, o som dos ga lhos" (56). Indeed, critic Affonso Romano de Sant'anna finds "the essential dialectic" of the novel to be the use of language to describe non-language, such that the failure of language on the part of the characters can only be depicted convincingly through the "inversely proportional" verbal prowess of the author (178).16 Seeking the sources for this innovative style some critics have invoked Ramos' difficult relationship to language as a child: bouts of vision problems combined with a disciplinarian father made reading and writing fraught activities for the boy.17 And indeed in his 1945 memoir Infância, Ramos de scribes his childhood with words that would seem to consciously cite the bestiary of Vidas secas: '"Eu vivia numa grande cadeia. Nâo, vivia numa ca deia pequeña, como papagaio amarrado na gaiola.'18 Significantly, the death of the papagaio that establishes the novel's concerns in its initial scene is justified by the words of Sinhá Vitoria, later echoed in Fabianos thoughts: "resolverá de supetäo aproveitá-lo como alimento ejustificara-se declarando a si mesma que ele era mudo e inútil" (15); "[n]a beira do rio haviam comido o papagaio, que näo sabia falar. Necessidade. Fabiano também nâo sabia falar ... Via perfeitamente que tudo era besteira (37). The parrot is killed for food, but the crime is absolved because of the bird's irredeemable bestiality (i.e. muteness). Carlos Alberto Doria has documented the consistent appearance of par rots throughout Ramos' oeuvre (20).19 He reads the papagaio as a kind of fa miliar or alter ego to Ramos and his interest in language. Doria concludes: Enquanto expressäo de algo alienado, inútil, caricatural, inumano, a fala do papagaio de Graciliano Ramos sinaliza o terreno fronteiriço entre a consci ência e o meio social e projeta a linguagem como forma de perdiçâo quando desconectada da vida concreta dos homens. A 'linguagem' do papagaio é externa ao animal e carente de significaçâo; inversamente, para o entorno humano, aparece como repetidora da forma, colocando o homem diante do aspecto mecánico, maquinal da propria fala. Onde há pouca fala, o papa gaio imita a natureza (abóia e late, arremedando a cachorra); onde há muita fala, como ñas escolas, crianças papagueiam 'medonhos arcaísmos de além mar.' (20) In the muteness of the papagaio in Vidas secas we see a mirror of the speechless humans. Ramos writes that the parrot "[n]äo podia deixar de</page><page sequence="6">Price 151 ser mudo' given its silent owners (15). But the uncertain nature of the pa pagaio's sounds—that is, whether it be speech or mere mimesis—also calls into question the utterances stuttered out by the miserable family. Given the parallels which Ramos laboriously sets up between the bird and its owners, the justification for killing the parrot—its woeful muteness—implies two conclusions: 1) according to the harsh logic of the sertäo, those who do not fulfill their expected roles in a quasi-feudal society will be eliminated, and 2) lacking language is justification for a merciless death.20 This, as I will dis cuss below in greater detail, recalls Agamben's idea of "bare life": that life which may be killed without compunction and without violating otherwise applicable bans on killing. At once special and sub-human, Agamben's bare life remains beneath (or beyond) sacrifice. In Vidas secas, the animals killed (the parrot, the dog) are models for the "bare life" of the humans, whom, in letters to his editor and wife, Ramos differentiated from the novel's nonhu man animals by the term "bípedes." In recent years Agamben has revived the Roman juridical figure of Homo Sacer, who possesses only "bare life" and who is excluded from the polis. Agamben thus ties the notion of bare life back to the Aristotelian idea that language turns people from mere animals into political animals.21 Accord ing to Aristotle, Agamben writes, "only man has language. The voice is the sign of pain and pleasure, and this is why it belongs to other living beings," whereas language "is for manifesting the fitting and the unfitting and the just and the unjust" (7-8). Language, for Agamben, occupies a special place with respect to sover eignty. According to the definition offered by Carl Schmitt and borrowed by Agamben, a sovereign is he who can decide the law while remaining out side of it. For Agamben, language too is like a sovereign that "declares that there is nothing outside language and that language is always beyond itself" (21). Agamben sees the law as particularly dependent on these traits of lan guage. He goes so far as to conclude: "To speak [dire] is, in this sense, always to 'speak the law,' ius dicere" (21). This is a link Ramos also suggests via Fabianos repeated run-ins with the law, always occasioned or aggravated by Fabianos inability to express himself accurately or to exculpate himself. (Here Ramos' own stint in prison on trumped up charges, directly prior to his writing Vidas secas, would seem to directly inform the novel). For Agamben, "bare life was reinscribed in nascent European states through acts that determined who remained a political animal within the polis and who a near animal banned from the city. Just as Fabianos brushes with the law, in the form of the soldado amarelo, inevitably occur either in the city or en route to it, the Roman and medieval English laws cited by Agamben make bandits (those banned from the city) into a homo sacer, a "monstruous hybrid of human and animal, divided between the forest and</page><page sequence="7">152 Luso-Brazilian Review 49:1 the city ... a threshold of indistinction and of passage between animal and man, physis and nomos, exclusion and inclusion . . . neither man nor beast, and who dwells paradoxically within both while belonging to neither" (105). The parallels between papagaio and retirante established in the first scenes of the book therefore set up the reader for the implied parallel between animals' bare life, summarily ended in the unapologetic name of human survival, and the retirantes' barren lives. Hence the redemptive importance of the true history of the parrot-actor documented in Como se morre no cinema—the fact that in real life, the papagaio flew away from the set. Baleia the Dog, or How One Dies in the Cinema The true tale ot the parrot s intended but eluded death resonates serendipi tously with both novel and film's central theme: the fate of the dog Baleia. [auntily flashing period newspaper headlines across the screen, Como se morre no cinema reminds viewers that the presumed death of the dog that played Baleia caused a furor among European advocates of animals rights when the film premiered at Cannes. An Italian countess decried Pereira's barbarity for having killed the dog. To placate such critiques, the director reassured the international community that Baleia was alive and well. But the countess was not satisfied with mere assurances. Baleia was produced: flown from Brazil to Paris, like a true film star.22 In relating this history the producers or the extra Como se morre no cinema do more than simply reveal comic anecdotes from the making of the film. Their emphasis on Baleia underscores the striking confluence of philosophical questions that converge in the filmic death of the dog. If the novel famously raised the specter of animal subjectivity by representing the consciousness of a dog as it faces its own death, the film brings these psy chological and aesthetic problems to a new level in questioning not only how to depict animal acting but also how to represent death on film. The merits of realism—versus a certain modernism—that had accompanied reviews of Ramos' novel, spurred on by the novel's singular depiction of a dog's con sciousness, are only amplified in light of film's longstanding debates over realism, representation and theatricality. Baleia's death had, of course, already been central to Ramos' novel. Within the novel's narrative chronology, it marks the watershed moment after which the family's luck worsens decidedly. The illusion of bourgeois domesticity represented by squatting in an abandoned farm will soon end as they are forced out again by drought. Baleia's death in this sense recalls the novel's opening death of the mute parrot. But Baleia's death is, furthermore, the occasion for a dog's "subjectivity" to be represented. Pereira recalls in an interview that when he announced his intention to adapt the film, he was</page><page sequence="8">Price 153 warned that he would never be able to successfully portray Baleia s death, since "it is not the consciousness of a human being. It is the consciousness of a dog. How will you convey what Graciliano Ramos wrote?'... it was really a great challenge. Baleia exists as a character with an inner life and not only as an animal that passes through each scene once. And her presence is felt until the climax of the film—her death. She lives this scene as if she were a human ... ,"23 To convey the centrality of Baleia s death to the narrative, as it appeared in Ramos' novel, was indeed a challenge. In fact, the chapter in Ramos' novel entitled "Baleia"—significantly, this sole chapter explicitly dedicated to the dog's perspective is that one in which she dies—was more than the climax of the narrative: it was the core of the novel itself. For "Baleia" had been the name of a short story Ramos wrote in May of 1937, shortly after being re leased from a prison sentence served for false political charges. In a card to his wife, Ramos, then living in Rio de Janeiro, had written Escrevi um conto sobre a morte duma cachorra, um troço difícil, como você vê: procurei adivinhar o que se passa na alma duma cachorra. Será que há mesmo alma em cachorro? Nao me importa. O meu bicho morre desejando acordar num mundo cheio de preás. Exatamente o que todos nós desejamos. A diferença é que eu quero que eles apareçam antes do sono, e padre Zé Leite pretende que eles nos venham em sonhos, mas no fundo todos somos como a minha Baleia e esperamos preás.24 While philosophers such as Descartes believed animals to be soulless au tomatons, Ramos makes the presentation of a dog's soul into the heart of the short story that would later become the novel Vidas secas. Having begun with just "Baleia" (first published in the Argentine newspaper La Prensa in its Spanish translation by Benjamin de Garay, who had commissioned Ra mos to write a series of regionalist stories), Ramos eventually ended up "acei tando como razoáveis o bicho, o matuto, a mulher, os garotos. Habituei-me tanto a eles que resolví aproveitá-los de novo" and after writing two more chapters, thought of bringing together the five in a single "novela miúda - um casal, duas crianças e uma cachorra, todos brutos" (qtd. in Castro 29). Ramos repeatedly underscores the centrality of the dog s interiority to the project. True, he also avows an interest in writing a novel about sertane jos. But it is important that the novel begins first as an inquiry into animal interiority, and secondarily as an exploration of humans—or "bipeds":25 Em 1937 escrevi algumas linhas sobre a morte duma cachorra, um bicho que saiu inteligente demais, creio eu, e por isso um pouco diferente dos meus bí pedes. Dediquei em seguida várias páginas aos donos do animal. Quando se trata de bípedes, nem por isso, embora certos bípedes sejam ocos; mas estu dar o interior duma cachorra é realmente urna dificuldade quase täo grande</page><page sequence="9">154 Luso-Brazilian Review 49:1 como sondar o espirito dum literato alagoano. Referindo-me a animais de dois pés, jogo com as mäos deles, com os ouvidos, com os olhos. Agora é diferente. O mundo exterior revela-se a minha Baleia por intermédio do ol fato, e eu sou um bicho de péssimo faro. Enfim parece que o conto está bom. (Ramos 1981,194-195) The interiority of a dog is obscured by an absence of language. Yet the world is revealed by other senses. If human (here, Alagoan) interiority is no less, or more, accessible than an animal's, the same is true of our experience of death, Ramos suggests. In fact, if language is one of the more obvious concerns in Vidas secas, that other trait which allegedly distinguishes people from animals—death—is a second.26 Significantly, the dog's death is announced as a muteness, as the impossibility of communication, a drying up of the throat: "uma sede horrí vel queimava-lhe a garganta ... Pôs-se a latir... Realmente nâo latia: uivava baixinho, e os uivos iam diminuindo, tornavam-se quase imperceptíveis" (82). Baleias death is central to both novel and film, I believe, because in it converge the multiple strands of philosophical arguments concerned with the animal/human divide. Throughout the Western philosophical tradition, and culminating to some extent in Heidegger, animals have been judged incapable of a "proper" death because they are believed unable to compre hend death in the same way as humans. As film scholar Akira Lippit sum marizes, in order to then critique this position, "the inability of animals to know death follows from the perceived absence of language among ani mals. Language brings consciousness and with it, the consciousness of con sciousness and its absence, or death. In this light, to have language is to have death. Without language, according to this sophism, animals have neither consciousness nor death" (2002: 11-12). Ramos and Pereira challenge this anthropocentrism: Baleia, speechless, will have consciousness and she will have death.27 Ramos s Realism Death and language haunt any artistic treatment of animals. The central at tention to animals in both the novel and film Vidas secas is crucial to both works' ability to break with existing genres and attain the stature of experi mental genres: Ramos' novel occupies a liminal generic position alternately described as modernista or regionalist, and Pereira's film is known as one of the defining instances of early Cinema Novo. Concerns with animality, death and language converge in generic preoccupations of realism, both lit erary and filmic. Realism depends upon several assumptions that the ani</page><page sequence="10">Price 155 mal calls into question. To begin with, realisms traditionally have sought to depict a human canvas. Whether a Balzacian comédie humaine—in which subjectivity is important, but the wide, synthetic colorful canvas of society is the goal—or a modernist realism seeking to represent a sliver of inner most consciousness, realisms have been concerned with representing more faithfully a reality not otherwise immediately perceptible. Realism is a kind of humanism. Few have worried about not "realistically" representing veg etal "Nature" for instance. "Nature" does not contest its capture on the page or film. It seems to simply exist, available for description. The intricacies of class or shades of interiority, on the other hand, demand a discerning mind and pen and are subject to evaluation as more or less accurate. Language again becomes the site at which subjectivity is, if not created, at least represented. Realism presumes some degree of transparency be tween media (language or film) and reality—at least enough for the reader or viewer to momentarily suspend concern with the artwork's artifice. Ramos's novel enters into this debate provocatively: because of its empha sis on animals and their extra-lingual subjectivity, it complicates theories of realism that depend upon a transparency between language and reality. We might call Ramos's an ecorealism. The artifice of putting words to inte rior thoughts is exposed. Ramos's novel attempted both a realistic depiction of the sertanejo's barren lives, and a portrait so unsentimentally realistic it would exceed realism's inherent humanism. For this schism Ramos's work was hailed both as the finest achievement in a series of nordestino novels of the thirties and as experimental and "modernist."28 For the latter Ramos was pilloried by Brazil's czars of socialist realism.29 Reading Vidas secas one sometimes senses that Graciliano Ramos al ready shrewdly anticipated any critical insights his book might produce. In one notable scene Fabiano argues over language, ownership, and the defini tion of an animal when he tries to sell some parts of his slaughtered pig in town, on which he is told he needs to pay taxes. He grows indignant and ends up mocking the local bureaucrat: he will take home the parts (which, he argues, no longer constitute an integral pig) and eat them. But may he? "Podia? Podia ou näo podia?" (90). Vidas secas, which Rubem Braga fa mously called in his review a romance desmontável, is like the unrecogniz able thing in Fabianos bag. How is it to be received, consumed? May we read it as realist? As modernist? Pode ou näo pode? As Sant'anna emphasizes in his reading of the novel, the fusion of people and animals is not merely metaphoric but "esconde um processo metonímico de composiçâo do livra, que nos levará à confecçâo de um modelo de permutabilidade que atravessa toda a obra" (155). Nelson Cerqueira has skillfully interrogated such claims, in particular questioning Sant anna's extension of permutability to the very thoughts of the characters (82-85). Yet elaborating on Sant anna's more ca</page><page sequence="11">156 Luso-Brazilian Review 49:1 pacious understanding of permutability—which seems to allude to Ramos s recollection of the process of the book's evolution30—we may speculate that the genre-bending (that is, species-bending) between human and animal in the novel finds its parallel in the genre-bending between modernism and realism, and between interiority and exteriority in the novel.31 Florencia Garramuño sees the novel as realist in a way that incorporates the insights of the modernist vanguards. If, as she writes, Flaubert inaugu rates a European modernism, Ramos, "desde el otro lado del arco temporal de las vanguardias, inicia la cancelación del modernismo brasileño ... es evidente que la novela de Graciliano Ramos no abandona del todo el pa trón referencial del realismo."32 Ramos borrows from humanist realists to go beyond the limits of the human and of language. Wander Melo Miranda and Antonio Candido note prior critics' view of the book's third person voice, a departure for Ramos, as an attempt to fuse inner and outer worlds (Miranda 114). And commentaries on Ramos' form frequently reference his use of free indirect discourse.33 By blurring the line between his characters' thoughts and "reality," Ramos effects the interpénétration of interiority and exteriority. Free indirect discourse was honed by nineteenth century Eu ropean realists, but rendered in the terrain of the sertäo not to depict the interplay of thoughts refracted in urban circles but the approximation of thought and nature when both are impoverished. The innovative vacilla tion between "realism" and "modernism" attributed to the novel would echo with the subsequent film's realism as it confronted the challenge of animal representation. Filmic Realism and Pereira s Neorealism Recent years have seen significant interest in the confluence of animals and film. Some critics have traced the overlapping concerns of film studies and animal studies, emphasizing film's origins in scientific attempts at measur ing animal life (famously in Muybridge and Marey's experiments aimed at analyzing animal motion.)34 An alternate emphasis has placed animals in film within a longer tradition of aesthetics, sometimes emphasizing an an titheatrical, humanist strain of philosophy that seeks to capture animals in paint or on film precisely because they are purportedly devoid of dissimula tion or ability to act (that is, pretend). This line sees animals in film to be one more iteration in a tradition in which animals serve to underscore human subjectivity. Cinemas own antitheatricality participates in a long-standing dramatic prejudice. In this history, what precisely constitutes "theatrical" has vacil lated between theater that acknowledges its performative nature (and there fore, according to critics such as Diderot, was not realist enough) to perfor</page><page sequence="12">Price 157 manees that would hide their theatricality (and hence are guilty of deeper deception, according to a more Brechtian aesthetics).35 But whatever the di vergent points of departure for these opposing strictures against "the theat rical," animals consistently complicate notions of theatricality and realism because of their presumed inability to act. Their naturalness shows up the artifice of the human stage, breaking the spell of realism. They are "caught in an uncertain space between the natural and the contrived" (Burt 11). In Animals in Film, John Burt argues that animals on screen effect a "rupture in the field of representation" insofar as their very presence reminds the viewer of a real world outside the cinema."36 The idea of animal actors therefore becomes paradoxical. As Nico Baum bach documents, the French auteur Robert Bresson, whose filmic project centered on exorcising theatricality or "acting" from his actors,37 was even concerned when filming his movie featuring a donkey, Au Hasard Baltha zar, that ... the donkey [Balthazar] would not be a character like the others, that is to say would appear a trained donkey, a performing donkey. So I took a donkey that knew how to do absolutely nothing. Not even how to pull a cart. I even had a great deal of trouble getting him to pull the cart in the film. In fact everything I believed he would give me, he would refuse me, and everything that I believed he would refuse me ... he gave me. Pull a cart, for example, one says to oneself: a donkey will do that. Well, not at all!... And what I have said to you somewhat rejoins if you will, what I was saying about actors ... I wanted that animal to be, even as an animal, crude matter.38 As Bresson's remarks suggest, to achieve an ultimate antitheatrical realism, humans must become like animals, untrained and unaware of their audi ence. Bresson, implicitly admitting that such a thing as a trainable (acting) animal is possible, believes animals also must be "captured" by the camera, rather than mug for it. The challenge of capturing animals on film becomes that of exteriorizing an otherwise inscrutable interiority traditionally attributed to other figures denied full subjectivity: women, sertanejos, etc. Indeed, Ramos writes at one point of Fabiano, "atrapalhava-se: tinha imaginaçâo fraca e nao sabia men tir": Fabiano approaches an animal in his sincerity (31). Such exteriorizing of interiority was an explicit goal of Pereira's cinema. In an interview with Gerald O'Grady Pereira describes how he tried to bring to film the interiority possible in literature, while eschewing certain linguis tic crutches to do so—a bit like Ramos's description of muteness achieved through language. Pereira attempted "to communicate what's going on in side the character . . . the thought, the feeling. It was born of a challenge created by literature ... It was difficult to get to the psychological, to the</page><page sequence="13">158 Luso-Brazilian Review 49:1 inside, except by using the device of the voiceover... I thought that this was a rather literary device, a return to the days of radio. The action depended on the words spoken. To avoid this artifice is really a challenge" (qtd. in Sad lier 123). Pereira's adaptation thus appropriates a "mute" genre (e.g., print as opposed to radio or film). Adaptation and appropriation between media and languages—like Ben jamin de Garay's Argentine translation, which, in a strange twist on the idea of an "original," was the first published version of the story "Baleia"— describe Pereira's treatment of Ramos's film. Pereira once said of the pro cess: "It's like I managed to make an appropriation of the author. It was like the one who wrote . . . Barren Lives wasn't Graciliano. I appropriated those books because of my admiration for the work of the writer; by way of my profound connection with them, I discovered that I was the owner of the story" (qtd. in Sadlier 126).39 Not only in relation to Ramos's novel, but also in his relationship to film styles, Pereira would play with questions of appropriation. He offers an alter native understanding of appropriation and what is his (proprio) in his loose borrowings from Italian Neorealism. His own earlier Rio 40 Graus spurred film critic Ely Azeredo to coin "Cinema Novo" for that aesthetic Glauber Rocha would call "urna estética da fome," and which Vidas secas would, in later considerations of the movement, come to embody (Sadlier 29). Pereira s discussion of his adaptation in terms of appropriation echoes themes that the novel emblematizes overtly in the ranch owner's branding his own name into animals that Fabiano has raised. Such scenes manage to introduce both the question of whether Fabiano is being dispossessed of his property and whether it is possible (or just) to make property out of any liv ing being.40 The question of appropriation and ownership, predominant in the novel, is further highlighted in Como se morre no cinema; an interview with Pereira reveals a suggestive anecdote about how Baleia was acquired. The filmmakers spotted the dog (named Piaba) in a marketplace in Alagoas. Enchanted by a dog that seemed to embody their idea of Baleia, they asked the nearby vendor to whom she belonged. The man answered that Piaba belonged to his nephew, who was lingering near the stand, and added that the crew would have to bring the boy onto the set if they wished to work with the cachorra, since she answered only to him. The crew obliged. But, Pereira recalls laughing, it turned out that Piaba was a stray; she be longed to no one, and the boy was not the man's nephew: the locals had merely hoped to profit from the unlikely presence of the film crew. As Como se morre no cinemas director Loiola Corrêa astutely perceived, that Piaba (Baleia) should belong to no one but be purchased nonetheless comments on both the novel's and the film's attention to the bilking of migrants by wealthy landowners, a scene included in Corrêa's short.</page><page sequence="14">Price 159 Appropriation is also closely linked to filmic realism s vexed ideal for the relation between an actor and her character. Again, which is more "realistic": acknowledging the theatricality of the medium, or "channeling" the subjec tivity of a fictional character? What happens when the fictional character is a character purportedly deprived of subjectivity—a dog, or a sertanejo? This is the problem that Ramos would first confront in depicting the psychology of sertanejos, and that Pereira would inherit in his adaptation of Ramos's lit erariness, which he wished to render without recourse to voice-over. It is the same challenge Ribeiro faced when she channeled Sinhá Vitoria in order to kill the parrot. As Alfredo Bosi observed in the short study "Céu, inferno," this debate over "subaltern" or animal subjectivity sits squarely at the heart of Vidas secas: Há momentos em que Fabiano intuí a propria situaçâo e consegue dizê-la com o laconismo de certos predicados bruscos. 'Fabiano, você é um hörnern, exclamou em voz alta.' Mas logo depois, 'pensando bem, ele näo era homem: era apenas um cabra ocupado em guardar coisas dos outros.' . . . Pergunto agora: de quem é o comentário—'pensando bem, ele näo era homem'? Da personagem? Do narrador? Graciliano recolhe aqui a palavra e a verdade do seu vaqueiro e reforça-as com o aval do narrador, que tudo sabe. Assim, o que parece faltar na hora da empatia (por franco respeito às diferenças existenciais) resgata-se no acorde da simpatía intelectual. O historiador só se encontra à vontade com a mente do pobre no nivel de um saber que é, afinal, a consciência comum àqueles que perceberam o caráter incontornável de classe da sociedade onde vivem.41 Bosi argues here that Ramos's blurring of the boundaries between ignorant peasant and omniscient narrator permits sympathy where empathy, only possible between "equals," is lacking.42 But if a depiction of convincing peasant interiority (or its circumstantial deprivation) is important to the film's realism, Pereira grapples with a more difficult test of realism when he appeals to a filmic tradition in which ani mals stand in for an absolute realism in Vida secas' most shattering scene, the killing of Baleia. Critics have often illustrated filmic animal death as a limit case of realism with recourse to Eisensteins Strike. In Strike, human death is evoked (but not represented) by cutting from oppressed workers to murdered animals in order to avoid what Eisenstein perceived as "'the false ness that the screen will not tolerate but that is unavoidable in even the most brilliant death scene"' (Lippit 2002: 14).43 Realism, never more imperiled than in a death scene, here draws its veracity from the presumed antitheat rical sincerity of animals. Akira Lippit elucidates the charged philosophical concerns that con verge in the scene of animal death on film, including consciousness, mor</page><page sequence="15">i6o Luso-Brazilian Review 49:1 tality, language, animality. If, he argues, "according to the strained logic of Western metaphysics, the animal cannot die—to the extent that death is seen as an exclusive feature of subjectivity and is reserved for those creatures capable of reflecting on being as such in language—then the death of the animal in film, on film, marks a caesura in the flow of that philosophy of be ing. The animal dies, is seen to die, in a place beyond the reaches of language ... Representations of animal death are similarly destined to the rhetorical economy of an antimetaphor" (2002:18). Death, as Eisenstein feared, gives the lie to filmic realism because, ex cepting snuff films, in the moment of death the audience is reminded of the theatrical nature of the production. Eisenstein, Bresson, Neorealists and the directors of Cinema Novo are certainly different in their versions of antithe atricality and emphases on realism. Eisenstein desired an authenticity of his actors that the impossibility of on-screen death defies; Bresson desired to wholly banish all remnants of performativity or theatricality; Neoreal ists sought non-professional actors and gritty, impoverished themes, as did early Cinema Novo, which scorned the melodramas of a more commercial industry. Yet for each of these different approaches, the ultimate test of real ism would indeed be "como se morre no cinema." Although criticism has placed both novel and film in a tradition of humanist regionalism, the 2005 Como se morre no cinema has refocused our attention on the genre- and species- subverting reflections Ramos and Pereira produced in considering bare live, barren lives, and animal life and death as they engage the chal lenges of representation.

Nico Baumbach argues that the very notion and terminology of a film "star" involves a displacement of the human.

He cau tions, "[a]s Edgar Morin points out, we shouldn't discuss anthropomorphism with out acknowledging its corollary "cosmomorphism".

According to Affonso Romano de Sant'anna's schematic analysis of the novel, "o problema da linguagem e expressäo dos figurantes" and "o silêncio na natureza e nos personagens" are among the most recurrent themes in the novel. Sant'anna, Análise estrutural de romances brasileiros, 168. 16. Randal Johnson's excellent essay on Vidas secas adopts what might be thought of as a Marxist humanist position, contextualizing the consideration of language with reference to Brazil's social and economic conditions: "If, as Affonso Romano de Sant'Anna suggests, the novel uses language to discuss non-language (i.e. Fa biano and his family's lack of language), then the very lack of language is due, ulti mately, to the economic, political, and social structures of Brazilian society" (16). 17.

Among these references Doria finds Ramos's frequent comparisons between himself and papagaios; allusions to readers as "frivolous and loquacious" papagaios, to children "papagueando"; and to religious movements "papagueadas" by the likes of nineteenth century beato Antonio Conselheiro. 20. 'Ihus Fabiano languishes as a herdless vaqueiro just as Baleia, dying, laments most not being able to perform her job rounding up cattle. 21. Agamben, in a debatably anachronistic language, adds that "in a different yet analogous way, today's democratico-capitalist project of eliminating the poor classes through development not only reproduces within itself the people that is excluded but also transforms the entire population of the Third World into bare life. Only a politics that will have learned to take the fundamental biopolitical fracture of the West into account will be able to stop this oscillation and to put an end to the civil war that divides the peoples and the cities of the earth" (180). 22. That Cinema Novo should disrupt traditional philosophical, theatrical or cinematic positions concerning semblance and acting is echoed in a fictional "rec reation" of a 1964 conversation shot for the extra: "if they really create an animal acting award, Baleia will compete with the Japanese crow and the Russian sheeps."

Dácio Antonio de Castro reviews the reception of Vidas Secas, noting that it was read as both an example of modernismo and of neorealism, which he explicitly links to Ramos' intention to portray subaltern subjectivity. He connects the fact that, again, "desde seu lançamento, passou a ser considerado pela crítica como o ápice da mudança de rumos operada pelo Modernismo, desde que José Américo de Almeida publicara A Bagaceira, em 1928" with the subsequent analysis: "Representa também a realizaçào estética mais apurada do Neo Realismo na literatura brasi</page><page sequence="18">Price iö3 leira.

Julgo que é a primeira vez que esse sertanejo aparece em literatura.... Procurei auscultar a alma do ser rude e quase primitivo que mora na zona mais recuada do sertäo, observar a reaçâo desse espirito bronco ante o mundo exterior, isto é, a hostilidade do meio físico e da injustiça humana. Por pouco que o selvagem pense—e os meus personagens sao quase selvagens—o que ele pensa merece anotaçâo. Foi essa pesquisa psicológica que procurei fazer; pesquisa que os escritores regionalistas näo fazem nem mesmo querem fazer, porque comumente näo conhecem o sertäo, nao sao familiares do ambiente que descrevem'" (31). Al though here Ramos emphasizes a modernist effort to present the inferiority of both sertanejo and landscape, his novel reveals his interest in presenting animal con sciousness as well. 26. Language and zoopomorphism are the two most common themes in Af fonso Romano de Sant anna's table. 27. Nelson Pereira dos Santos recalls that after a visit to Czechoslovakia "my Marxist phase stopped. In reality, what happened for me was that these events opened up my thinking to other questions; it was the humanitarian aspect. Not humanitarian, but humanist. This humanist aspect of thought, which didn't come from Marxism but from some Marxists, especially in Brazil, who have the humanist tradition, was the positive side of that trip" (qtd. in Sadlier 135). Pereira is, indeed, humanist when he presents his subjectivization of Baleia in terms of her humanity. 28. In summarizing analyses of Ramos' generic position (realist and/or mod ernist), Wander Melo Miranda situates him as a modernist who differs from but shares in attributes of both other regionalist authors and the more fully modernist peers. "A questäo da linguagem" in Ramos, he writes, is "crucial para se determinar a posiçâo da obra de Graciliano em relaçâo à de seus contemporáneos e à tradiçâo literária brasileira ... A contrapelo da 'contribuiçâo milionária de todos os erros', apregoada por Oswald de Andrade e seus companheiros da geraçâo de 22, Graci liano submete a lingua oral aos rigores da norma gramatical e a uma requintada reelaboraçâo, nesse ponto distanciando-se também de seus contemporáneos re gionalistas. O resultado é uma dicçâo clássica, ao mesmo tempo que experimental, como apontou Otto Maria Carpeaux" (110). According to Garbuglio, "Graciliano Ramos requer já, como todo bom modernista, a presença do leitor para a compreen säo da obra, estabelecendo os nexos de causalidade lógica" 1987, p. 430). Nelson Cerqueira reviews the reception of Ramos' book as realist in a chapter entitled "A metamorfose do realismo"; Hermenéutica e literatura: um estudo de As I Lay Dying, de William Faulkner, e Vidas secas, de Graciliano Ramos.

Clara Ramos, "Elementos de biografía," in José Carlos Garbuglio, Alfredo Bosi e Valentim Facioli, Graciliano Ramos (Säo Paulo: Editora Ática, 1987), 329-330. 30. In Valentim Facioli's intellectual biography of Ramos, he cites an interview by Francisco de Assis Barbosa with Ramos in which the author of Vidas secas re counts the process of constructing the novel, which had begun with the "Baleia" short story and continued in piecemeal fashion. Assis Barbosa writes: "Graciliano guarda os origináis dos livras já publicados. Assim pude verificar um curioso de talhe da feitura de Vidas secas. Os capítulos datados indicaram-me a ausência de seguimento na elaboraçâo da narrativa. 'Baleia,' o nono capítulo, foi o primeiro a ser escrito, em 4-5-1937. Um mês e pouco depois, precisamente no dia 18 de junho, escreveu o quarto capítulo, 'Sinha Vitoria.' Ε assim todo o livro, que nao obedeceu a nenhum plano antecipado" (qtd. in Facioli 64). 31. Randal Johnson succinctly argues for a formal connection not only between these versions of Vidas secas but between modernismo and cinema novo more broadly: "Brazilian Cinema Novo, one of the most important film movements to appear internationally in the 1960s, is a cinematic heir of literary Modernism (1922 1930) and parallels it in many ways (Johnson, 3). 32. Florencia Garramuño, "Introducción," in Graciliano Ramos, Vidas secas, trans. Florencia Garramuño (Buenos Aires: Corregidor, 2001), 19. 33. See Castelar de Carvalho, "O discurso indireto livre em Vidas secas de Graci liano Ramos" (http://www.filologia.org.br/abf/volume3/númeroi/o5.htm, accessed August 12, 2008). Darlene Sadlier similarly points out that the same technique that was to radically inject Baleia with a hitherto proscribed subjectivity was poorly re ceived as a mode for depicting sertanejo subjectivity: "Throughout the novel... we are made privy to the thoughts of Fabiano, Sinhá Vitoria, their two young sons, and even Baleia. Ramos makes considerable use of free indirect discourse—a tech nique in which a third-person narration simulates an inner monologue or stream of consciousness. A few early reviews of Vidas Secas took issue with this approach, claiming that Ramos was giving false psychological depth to "rustic" types. Curi ously, that that same narrative technique was used to attribute complexity to Baleia seemed less problematic to critics, who apparently could imagine an animal reflect ing on the world but had difficulty believing that Fabiano had the intelligence to equate his nomadic existence with that of a wandering Jew" (41). 34. For more on this history see Mary Ann Doane, The Emergence of Cinematic Time (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2002); Akira Lippit, Electric Animal: Towards a Rhetoric of Wildlife (Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 2000), and John Burt, Animals in Film (London: Reaktion Books, 2002). Burt summarizes, "[f]rom its inception cinema projected life and vitality—the principle of animation—and assumed from early on the role of a fantastic technological zoo. Two modes of projection, filmic and psychic, bind cinema to animals, technology to life. Hervé Aubron argues for the inherent relationship of cinema to the animal, linked historically to postindus trial spectacles. "The animal inevitably questions the origins of cinema because the animal was its first model. But also because cinema was fused with animals in its earliest stages'" (12).</page><page sequence="20">Price 165 35- I am indebted to Toril Mois work on theatricality for considering these in tersections of realism and theatricality.

Randal Johnson's comprehensive "Vidas secas and the Politics of Filmic Ad aptation" analyzes those elements in the film that differ from the novel. 40. The process is described laconically in Vidas secas: "Pouco a pouco o ferro do proprietário queimava os bichos de Fabiano. Ε quando näo tinha mais nada para vender, o sertanejo endividava-se. Ao chegar a partilha, estava encalacrado, e na hora das contas davam-lhe urna ninharia" (87). 41. Alfredo Bosi, "Céu, inferno" in José Carlos Garbuglio, Alfredo Bosi e Valen tim Facioli, Graciliano Ramos (Säo Paulo: Editora Ática, 1987), 388. 42. The passage from perceiving to naming (alleged mark of the human), and from naming back to perceiving (from literature to film) itself involves a series of appropriations. As Lourival Holanda rightly notes, a striking passage in Vidas secas in which the older child wishes to turn words into things—"que a palavra virasse coisa" (55)—highlights how naming itself is a form of appropriation.
