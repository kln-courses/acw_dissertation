It was a commonplace among the Greeks and Romans that with each succeeding generation the human race became somewhat shorter. Shorter, and proportionately feebler: at Troy, Hector picked up a stone "which not even a pair of men, the best in a village, could hoist into a wagon . . . humans being what they are now" (Iliad 12.447-49). For the superior stature of early man the ancients possessed evidence of a vivid, incontrovertible sort. It would turn up in gullies after a strong rain, or in fields during plowing: bones, of recognizable form, several times human size. Although final interpretation of the find would be left to the authori- ties, nobody who saw one could possibly mistake the prove- nance of a four-foot femur or a ten-gallon skull. These were the bones of heroes, and of the giants and monsters they had battled once upon a time. Adrienne Mayor's fascinating book reexamines bone finds in classical antiquity, drawing on the numerous ac- counts left behind by writers from Xenophanes to Augustine. Beyond compiling the sources, Mayor has versed herself deeply in Mediterranean paleontology, that of Greece in particular. Through extensive travel, research, and consulta- tion with local paleontologists, she has compiled enough evidence to show that the majority of locations where so- called "giants' bones" were found correspond to areas with well-known fossil beds - many of them as rich in finds now as they were in antiquity. The bones come not from dino- saurs but from the giant mammals that ruled the earth roughly 10,000 to 30 million years ago: mastodons, mam- moths, saber-toothed tigers, as well as oversized sloths, cattle, giraffes, and cave bears. Greece unfortunately is too young, geologically speaking, to have preserved the remains of any of the creatures that appear in Jurassic Park. But the bones of the mammals are impressive enough. Moreover, they often retain a curiously anthropomorphic appearance, as several of Mayor's photographs show. Her argument is convincing: what the ancients saw as the skeletal remains of lost races of men, monsters, and gods were often in fact mammal fossils. This claim is filled out by archaeological evidence. Several ancient writers mention public exhibits of unusually large bones; Mayor's search through old excavation records accordingly turned up reports of fossils found within the precincts of ancient temples, where they seem originally to have been on display. One example (her telling of it is one of the highlights of the book) comes from Egypt, where archae- ologists uncovered fossilized "remains" of the god Set in his shrine at Qau. The investigators, Guy Brunton and Sir Flinders Petrie, dug up several tons of animal bones during the 1920s and had them shipped back to museums in Britain. There, in storage rooms, they languished for nearly a century, until Mayor's inquiries prompted the museums' curators to track down the dusty crates: inside sat piles of bones carefully wrapped in linen, fossils that in Egypt three millennia earlier had been worshipped as the remains of Set, the god of darkness. Throughout the book, Mayor questions how much the activities of ancient "fossil hunters," as she calls them, and modern paleontologists truly differ. The gap is smaller than one might expect. Both groups are engaged in recovering the bones of extinct species, and both are interpreting the bones as evidence for such species. (Remember than in Greek mythology, giants, monsters, and heroes constitute species of a sort, which for various reasons have gone extinct.) Both also attempt to measure and reconstruct their finds - though of course modern efforts in this regard are far more careful and systematic. Finally, both typically put their finds on display in public buildings whose social role has remained fairly constant over time: temples then, today museums. After noting these parallels, Mayor asks why the ancients</page><page sequence="2">Volume 78, Number 1 The Classical Outlook / Fall 2000 47 did not go further: what kept them from seeing the fossils for what they were, the bones of extinct mammals, rather than as relics of supernatural beings like heroes or monsters? Her answer, that popular tradition had an inkling of the truth, but was stymied by institutionalized science's wholesale dismissal of fossil evidence, did not convince this reader, but the evidence she has mustered to support her argument is certainly worth pondering. Much to its credit, the story told by The First Fossil Hunters remains unfinished. Despite the breadth and depth of her book, Mayor acknowledges that she has only scratched the surface as far as historical sources, archaeology, and paleontology are concerned. There is a promise of many more discoveries. The bones of Set have been relocated, but they remain in their crates, and wait to be unwrapped. Philip THiBODEAU University of Georgia</page></plain_text>
