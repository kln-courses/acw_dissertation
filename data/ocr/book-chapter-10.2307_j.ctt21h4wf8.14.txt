<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> -------------------------------------------------------------------------  posTsCRIpT  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ posTsCRIpT Readers of chapter 7 of this book will be aware that maimonides uses  two technical terms in the Sefer ha-Mitsvot when referring to the plain  meaning (peshat) of scripture: the Aramaic peshateh di-qera as well as  its equivalent, gufeh di qera, and the Arabic zahir al-nass. At the time of  writing the dissertation, and through the subsequent period of revising  it for publication, I maintained the intention to return to this matter,  since I felt that a precise definition and the relation between these  terms had eluded me (see footnote 30, chapter 7). Just as this book  goes to print, I have had the opportunity to read the recently published  (and anxiously anticipated; see chapter 7, footnote 26) monograph  opening the Gates of Interpretation: Maimonides’ Biblical Hermeneutics  in Light of His Geonic-Andalusian Heritage and Muslim Milieu (leiden:  Brill, 2011), by mordechai Cohen, in which he tries to shed light on this  question. Cohen has the great merit of having noticed and investigated  the precise contours of these two terms by which maimonides describes  the plain sense of the text. In fact, to the best of my knowledge, he may  be the first maimonidean scholar ever to have done so. space and time  considerations allow me neither to detail his arguments nor to offer my  rebuttal and my own views in more than a summarizing fashion; these  will have to await a future article. still, the main conclusions are worth  presenting as they bear on what is discussed in the second half of this  book. I beg the reader to review the analysis conducted in chapter 7  before reading this postscript, as I plan to allude or briefly refer to, but  not to repeat, some of the evidence drawn from the Sefer ha-Mitsvot.    Cohen begins by distinguishing between the meaning of a term,  i.e., its strict definition, and its use, that is, “the specific connotations  it conveys in a particular context.” He concludes that peshateh di-qera,  meaning an “unfolding of the text,” simply represents the plain and  — 337 — </page> <page sequence="2"> -------------------------------------------------------------------------  posTsCRIpT  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ straightforward sense of the verse, much as sarah Kamin describes  its Hebrew equivalent, peshuto shel miqra. Concerning the use of the  term, Cohen argues that maimonides reserves it for halakhically  authoritative readings, even when these readings depart from the  philological contextual sense of the verse. Peshateh di-qera, then, is a  marker for peshat as sanctioned by the oral sinaitic tradition. Zahir al- nass, on the other hand, denoting that which becomes visible, i.e., the  external sense, has generally been understood as the literal sense by  maimonides’ Andalusian predecessors. But maimonides uses it, pace  Cohen, in a number of ways, sometimes to express the manifestly  correct sense or the obvious sense of the text, and sometimes, by  contrast, to denote the apparent sense of the text. The latter somewhat  negative judgment of zahir al-nass — “apparent,” with the connotation  of insufficient or essentially incorrect — is primarily driven by the fact  that maimonides in the Guide faults zahir al-nass for the mistaken  conceptions of God that unsophisticated readers acquire on reading  anthropomorphic passages in the Bible (open the Gates, 105). To be sure,  Cohen maintains that “the term zahir in the Sefer ha-Mitsvot generally  connotes the contextual-philological interpretation,” a statement with  which one can whole-heartedly concur, but then adds, in line with his  thesis, that zahir may represent the apparent sense, “which would be  correct if not for an opposing authoritative rabbinic interpretation”  (opening the Gates, 118). That is, zahir is a marker for a rejected view.  Peshateh di-qera and zahir al-nass are close enough equivalents that  both Ibn Tibbon and Kafih, the two main translators of the Sefer ha- Mitsvot, rendered these terms simply as peshat. Cohen acknowledges  this very close connection when he says that “maimonides regarded  zahir al-nass as a key component in determining the correct meaning  of peshateh di-qera, and he did not ignore the close relation between the  two concepts, notwithstanding the distinction he made between them  in the Book of Commandments. In fact, in his Hebrew writings ... he  at times does use the term peshat in the sense of Arabic zahir, which  further indicates the link between the two concepts in his view”  (opening the Gates, 436 n.12). The “distinction he made between  them” is more imagined than real, as we find only one case, N165,  in which maimonides contrasts, and then only indirectly, these two  — 338 — </page> <page sequence="3"> -------------------------------------------------------------------------  posTsCRIpT  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ hermeneutics. In his summary of the nine instances in which peshateh  di-qera appears in the Sefer ha-Mitsvot, Cohen admits that in as many  as seven instances, peshateh di-qera adheres to zahir al-nass, while in  two other instances it does not (opening the Gates, 331-334). What  Cohen sees as divergence from zahir al-nass is based on a subjective  appreciation of what the contextual meaning of the verse should convey,  hardly a solid basis for such a determination. A methodological caution  is in order with respect to other writings since it is entirely possible that  maimonides used these terms differently throughout his literary career  and therefore they may not shed useful light on their usage in the Sefer  ha-Mitsvot — despite Cohen’s valiant efforts. For example, in the Guide  maimonides may have taken zahir al-nass to refer simply to the literal  sense of words, as opposed to their figurative or philosophical sense, in  the same way saadia and some of his other predecessors did, and much  as modern scholarship has understood it.   I remain unconvinced of Cohen’s precisions, as I have adumbrated  in footnote 30 of chapter 7, particularly with respect to maimonides’  use, though not the meaning, of the terms. Nevertheless, Cohen’s  thorough analysis and my own recent research on zahir al-nass as used  in the Guide have led me to make a slight and important correction  in the definition of these two terms. In my revised opinion, peshateh  di-qera stands for the straightforward sense of a verse, one that results  from being able to explain all the grammatical components of the  sentence as they are commonly used and applying to the verse the  minimum amount of force. In the Sefer ha-Mitsvot, maimonides uses  peshateh di-qera specifically to reject the fanciful, homiletic alternative  interpretations that the Talmudic rabbis offer for certain verses, i.e.,  derashot, which, in his view, do not represent scripture’s true intention.  Therefore, these interpretations cannot be said to attain the status  of scriptural law. significantly, the context in which the verses are  presented plays no role in this exegesis.  These criteria are mostly or wholly consistent with the nine  appearances of peshateh di-qera in the Sefer ha-Mitsvot. The atomistic  reading of Exodus 18:20 (see Rule 2) and deuteronomy 23:24 (p94)  proposed by some midrashim and cited by maimonides as invalid  interpretations of scriptural laws because they chop the various parts of  — 339 — </page> <page sequence="4"> -------------------------------------------------------------------------  posTsCRIpT  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ the verse into unintelligible utterances, are good examples of derashot  that violate peshateh di-qera (see my chapter 7, pages 249-250). Along  similar objections, the rabbinic derashah to deuteronomy 14:1 (cited  by maimonides at N45) that forbids the dividing of people and causing  strife works by uprooting the words lo titgodedu from the rest of the  verse and must therefore be rejected as an interpretation that does not  follow gufeh di-qera (the equivalent to peshateh di-qera). Again, by the  same token, the prohibition against eating filthy or repulsive things  derived by the rabbis homiletically from the words “ye shall not make  yourselves detestable” (leviticus 11:43) works only by reading this  sentence in isolation from the rest of the verse. As maimonides avers,  peshateh di-qera, a look at the entire verse, reveals that the prohibition  concerns itself only with creeping things (sherets). In Rule 3, maimonides  places peshateh di-qera in apposition to a textual intimation (remez) and  reveals a similar criterion. The short passage reads as follows: “Now  although (the rabbis) do say: ‘An intimation against stealing a holy  vessel (is found in the verse) “And they shall not go in to see as they  dismantle (or ruin)  (kevalla‘) the holy...”’ — it is sufficient that they  labeled it [i.e., this derashah] an intimation (remez); the peshateh di- qera does not carry this sense.” The short clause containing the difficult  kevalla‘ is homiletically read as a warning against stealing or hiding  holy vessels (see Rashi, bsanhedrin 81b). However, the entire verse,  governed by the predicate “go in to see” as well as the sense provided  by the immediately prior verse to which this verse is connected via the  conjunctive vav, makes it clear that the straightforward sense is about  the prohibition against levites seeing the holy vessels as the sanctuary  is being dismantled and moved to another location.  The historical explanation that maimonides gives, in the name of  peshateh di-qera, to harmonize the plain sense of Exodus 20:24 with  normative halakhah rather than to adopt the forced midrash of Rabbi  yishmael (at p20), is proof evident of the high regard maimonides has  for peshateh di-qera (p20). In effect, the midrash succeeds in reconciling  the text with halakhah only by assuming an unlikely and unexpected  ellipsis in a perfectly readable text and by supplying the elided term. This  type of violence to the text is inimical to peshateh di-qera hermeneutics.  And yet it is worth noting that the derashah carries the day, and it is so  — 340 — </page> <page sequence="5"> -------------------------------------------------------------------------  posTsCRIpT  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ codified in MT, Hilkhot Bet ha-Behirah 1:13. Here, then, peshateh di-qera  is not necessarily the authoritative interpretation that Cohen makes it  out to be.    one might be tempted to question maimonides’ use of peshateh  di-qera in connection with leviticus 19:14 at N299 in light of the fact  that he adopts a figurative rather than a simpler and more literal sense  for the verse. We should note, however, that peshateh di-qera does not  necessitate literal readings; a figurative interpretation can also do,  as long as the interpretation “fits” the entire verse, and in this case,  as the cited sifra makes clear, it unquestionably does. maimonides’  preference for the figurative over the literal sense on this occasion may  be a function of such things as the belief that the physical sense has  already been covered by a different proof-text (see the immediately  preceding N298), the unexpected appearance of the word “give” (titen)  where one might have expected “put” (tasim) if a physical obstacle was  being planted, or simply aesthetic considerations. The point is that the  choice between literal and figurative, all else being equal, is a matter of  subjective preference rather than the application of the hermeneutics of  an “unfolding of the text.” moreover, maimonides uses peshateh di-qera  on this occasion not to reject the literal sense but, as always, to reject  the multiple rabbinic interpretations — some of which he cites — that  are appended to this verse.  In connection with Exodus 20:20, Cohen argues that maimonides  adopts the peshateh di-qera (as substantiated by Mekhilta) that reads  the verse as a prohibition to make graven images even for non-worship  purposes, in opposition, so he argues, to the philological-contextual  construal (zahir al-nass), which sees the verse as a prohibition to  make graven images, i.e. idols, for the purposes of worship. In his  words, “In this case, the rabbinic commentary [referring to Mekhilta’s  interpretation] is an authoritative ‘transmitted interpretation’ that  overrides zahir al-nass ... that would have been correct otherwise.”  Besides committing the error of subjective preference discussed earlier,  Cohen fails perhaps to appreciate Mekhilta’s close reading of the verse  and all its parts, in this case the play on the preposition-plus-plural- pronoun lakhem, for yourselves, which follows the verb “to make” and  yields “to make for yourselves,” i.e. for your pleasure and benefit. As  — 341 — </page> <page sequence="6"> -------------------------------------------------------------------------  posTsCRIpT  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ usual, the peshateh di qera comes to disavow the reader from other  far-fetched derashot, as Cohen correctly points out, “maimonides here  invokes the rule of peshat to choose the rabbinic interpretation that is  more reasonable ... as opposed to other laws attached to the text by way  of derash” (opening the Gates, 318). The use of gufeh di-qera (equivalent to peshateh di-qera) at N165  requires a short introduction because the discarded view is not as  obvious as those we have examined earlier. The commandment that  forbids priests to leave the sanctuary while ministering is based on two  verses. The first verse addresses the common priest with the words,  “you shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting” (leviticus  10:7), while the second refers to the High priest and says, “He shall not  go outside the sanctuary and he shall not profane the sanctuary of his  God” (leviticus 21:12). In Rule 5 of the Sefer ha-Mitsvot, maimonides  deals with motive clauses framed in the form of negative injunctions,  and states that these clauses are not to be enumerated as independent  commandments. one of the examples he provides is leviticus 21:12. He  points out that the sentence “and he shall not profane the sanctuary”  must be understood as a motive clause explaining why the High priest  is prohibited from going out: the High priest must not go out of the  sanctuary lest he profane the sanctuary. This, he argues, is the correct  way of reading the verse; the negative injunction must not be read  out of context to support a second and independent prohibition, to  wit, that the High priest must not profane the sanctuary, as other  enumerators of the commandments seem to have done. It follows that  the prohibition to go out of the sanctuary is effective only when the  opportunity to profane the sanctuary presents itself, that is, while the  High priest is ministering. maimonides, with the help of sifra, extends  this rationale to all priests, thus the prohibition for priests to go out  of the sanctuary while ministering. At any rate, through the correct, or  straightforward, way of reading the “second” prohibition, maimonides  manages to add an important qualification to the prohibition against  priests leaving the sanctuary. Hence maimonides is justified in saying  that gufeh di-qera supports his reading of the verse.  In sum, peshateh di-qera in the Sefer ha-Mitsvot stands for a method  of interpreting scripture that features the straightforward, plain sense  — 342 — </page> <page sequence="7"> -------------------------------------------------------------------------  posTsCRIpT  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ reading of texts, one that requires the least amount of grammatical  and syntactical manipulation and that takes special care in reading  the verse as a whole; words or groups of words may not be taken out  of context. The interpretative unit in which peshateh di-qera operates,  however, is the individual verse and not the larger passage in which the  verse is embedded. Peshateh di-qera makes its appearance in the Sefer  ha-Mitsvot wherever fanciful and forced interpretations or derashot are  mentioned, referred to or alluded to, and it is used as a categorical foil  to these derashot.          Zahir al-nass is a creative hermeneutic with an illustrious Andalusian  pedigree, as Cohen demonstrates, that follows philologically sound  principles and takes into account both context and the logic of an entire  passage. Zahir al-nass reflects the intention of the author and therefore,  contra Cohen, is deemed to reflect the correct sense of scripture.  This is so in the Guide, as I have recently argued in “maimonides on  Anthropomorphism: should scripture be Read philosophically?” (As  a Perennial Spring: A festschrift Honoring Rabbi Dr� Norman Lamm, ed.  Bentsi Cohen, david B. Greenberg [Ny: 2013]), and this is true also in  the Sefer ha-Mitsvot. Cohen tries to show that zahir al-nass in the Sefer  ha-Mitsvot is trumped by tradition in N46, proving therefore that it  yields an incorrect, non-authoritative meaning (opening the Gates, 118- 120). However, puzzlingly, maimonides appears to contradict here his  own Rule 8, which states that the determination of whether a negative  particle stands for a prohibition or a negation can be made only by  the logic of the passage and not by tradition. In maimonides’ words,  “there is no clear-cut rule for distinguishing a negative statement  from an admonition, except by the purport of the statement.” Cohen  appears to overlook this point and therefore regards zahir al-nass here  as “incorrect.” (Tantalizingly, maimonides may in fact be protesting the  rabbinic tradition!)  This is not to deny that zahir al-nass may in fact be trumped by a  received tradition, as maimonides suggests in Rule 9 with respect to  otiose scriptural passages, where these redundancies are expected to be  taken as stylistic variations or for the purpose of emphasis. As Cohen  notes, “... where the rabbis attribute a new meaning to the seemingly  redundant verse, their interpretive tradition, in his opinion, is ‘most  — 343 — </page> <page sequence="8"> -------------------------------------------------------------------------  posTsCRIpT  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ correct’ and overrides the zahir, which would otherwise have been more  reasonable” (opening the Gates, 121). As we saw earlier, this is also true  for peshateh di-qera.  In this book, I have shown that maimonides minimizes the  number of traditional interpretations that are not compatible with  plain meaning and makes strong efforts to make the traditional  interpretation conform to the plain sense of the text. my argument is  not that zahir must at times take a backseat to tradition, but rather that  maimonides will not cite a zahir interpretation in the Sefer ha-Mitsvot  in the sense of “apparent meaning” for the purpose of rejecting it.    As we saw earlier, maimonides applies (at N165) peshateh di-qera to  leviticus 10:7 in support of a general scriptural claim that priests are  forbidden to go out of the sanctuary while ministering. In that same  comment to N165, maimonides applies a zahir al-nass interpretation to  the parallel passage (leviticus 21:12), which refers, as we saw earlier,  to the High priest and determines that the High priest is forbidden to  accompany the bier of a near relative (M Sanhedrin 2:1 attributes this  opinion to R. Judah). The exegesis is based on the fact that the verse  appears in a section discussing the manner in which the High priest  should behave when one of his relatives dies. The context is therefore  critical to this interpretation. The subsequent Talmudic discussion  attributes R. Judah’s view not to a contextual reading of the verse  but to rabbinic concerns that the grieving High priest may come to  defile himself by touching the corpse during the funeral procession.  At the same time, maimonides does not enumerate this prohibition  in his count of the 613 scriptural commandments. on this evidence,  Cohen deduces that zahir al-nass does not represent the authoritative  interpretation of the verse and therefore zahir al-nass can only be said  here to be the apparent sense of scripture (but see opening the Gates,  127 and footnote 132, where Cohen seems to waver), in glaring contrast  with peshateh di-qera, which, as we saw, yields a scriptural law. This  conclusion is unwarranted in my view. maimonides’ comments in the  Sefer ha-Mitsvot seem to indicate quite clearly that he holds the zahir  al-nass interpretation to be genuine and scriptural in nature, rather  than the product of a rabbinic precautionary decree, but that it would  not affect the enumeration of commandments because of a principle  — 344 — </page> <page sequence="9"> -------------------------------------------------------------------------  posTsCRIpT  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ enunciated in Rule 9, namely, that two verses that repeat the same  law, as in this case, must not be counted separately. moreover, in his  comment to that same mishnah, maimonides states that the halakhah  follows R. Judah’s view, suggesting that at least at an earlier stage he  adhered to the zahir al-nass (maimonides’ opinion with respect to the  scriptural status of R. Judah’s law may have changed in the later MT;  but see Kafih, Sefer ha-Mitsvot, N165 n. 17, and see Hilkhot Biat ha- Miqdash 2:6, which seems to presuppose this exegesis). At N181, maimonides clearly endorses zahir al-nass and adopts it  as the primary meaning of Exodus 22:30. Cohen’s explanation for the  reason maimonides calls this construal zahir al-nass rather than peshateh  di-qera as he should, in view of the fact that the latter term denotes  authoritative meaning, is highly convoluted and must be rejected.  Cohen wavers with respect to leviticus 19:17 (at N303), where  maimonides registers, “somewhat surprisingly” in Cohen’s words,  “his understanding of zahir al-nass.” on the one hand, Cohen renders  zahir al-nass in this gloss as “the apparent sense of the text,” meaning  the incorrect or superficial sense, but on the other he suggests that  “maimonides does not seem to relinquish the contextual (meaning),  and states that it appears to have influenced his halakhic thinking, as  implied by his formulation of p205” (123-124). I have already shown  in my book (see pages 318-320) that maimonides in the MT treats the  zahir al-nass reading as fully authoritative.  In conclusion, zahir al-nass in the Sefer ha-Mitsvot is a philological- contextual reading of the scriptural text that maimonides attempts to  incorporate into the body of scriptural law even absent an oral tradition  to this effect. Peshateh di-qera and zahir al-nass are two distinct peshat  tools that operate tangentially to each other in maimonides’ legal  scriptural hermeneutics and that accomplish different objectives.  In broad strokes, maimonides uses the former as a bulwark against  fanciful interpretations, and he uses the latter as a way to plumb  the true intentions of the law. None of these serve as markers of  authoritativeness or lack thereof as Cohen has strenuously but  unsuccessfully, in my opinion, argued.  — 345 — </page> </plain_text>
