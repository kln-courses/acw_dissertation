An annotated bibliography of literature on the Spotted Owl. 1984. R. W. Campbell, E. D. Forsman, and B. M. Van der Raay. British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Land Management Report No. 24, 116 p. (Available from Queen's Printer, Victoria, British Columbia V8V 1X4 for $7.50 Canadian.)-This bibliography covers the literature on Strix occidentalis for the period 1859 to 1983 and includes 586 citations. Citations considered of particular importance were annotated, and editorial comments are included parenthetically concerning presumed accuracy. The compilers point out that until relatively recently little has been known about this nocturnal owl, but that has changed. Growing out of our knowledge of this species has been a concern about (a) "the owl's presumed imcompatibility with intensive forest management practices which directly, and indirectly may affect its living space, prey base, and reproductive capacity," and (b) "the possible threat posed by the invasion of the Barred Owl (Strix varia) into the range of the Spotted Owl." Each citation is listed alphabetically by author and is numbered serially for indexing. The index is set up according to 39 broad subject categories with six of those categories, i.e., American Birds/Audubon Field Notes, Checklists, Distribution (Specific Location), Foods, Habitat, and Sightings having geographic subdivisions by state and province within them. All citations are complete as possible to facilitate researchers obtaining them (this is especially useful for unpublished government reports which are included). This work should be indispensable for anyone seriously interested in the Spotted Owl. It is encouraging to see bibliographies (especially those in the working category that have some sort of referencing system included within them) being published. If those that use them in researching the literature would acknowledge their use I think we would see many more of them being published.-Richard J. Clark. 44. Life of the Woodpecker. A. F. Skutch. 1985. Ibis Publ. Co., Santa Monica, California. 136 p. $49.95.-This enchanting narrative, based largely on the author's 40 years of field experience, is a popular book that summarizes much of what is known about the family Picidae. The book begins with an introduction by S. Dillon Ripley, followed by a short preface and a chapter highlighting several of the characteristics and adaptations unique to the Picidae. Subsequent chapters cover woodpecker foods and foraging, excava- tions and territories, daily activities, drumming, voice displays, and pair formation, nesting, and the fledging of young. Two final chapters deal with usurpers, parasites, and predators of woodpeckers, and the intimate but often precarious relationship between woodpeckers and man. Accompanying the text are 67 color plates by Dana Gardner, a taxonomic list of the woodpeckers of the world, and a useful bibliography. Woodpeckers range from the diminutive Olivaceous Piculet (Picumnus olivaceus) to the likely extinct 22-inch Imperial Woodpecker (Campephilus imperialis). The zygodactyl toe arrangement of woodpeckers is found in only two other bird orders. As an adaptation for feeding on prey found in cracks and crevices, many woodpeckers are equipped with a row of recurved barbs on the tip of the tongue for prey capture. Members of this family are also endowed with extraordinarily long tongues that can be extended as much as 10 cm, enabling them to reach food deep within a tree. The latter adaptation is achieved because the tongue extends around the back of the skull, over the crown, and either winds around the right eyeball or embeds in the hollow upper mandible. This structural arrangement not only benefits such species as Pileated (Dryocopus pileatus) and Lineated (D. lineatus) wood- peckers who probe deep into the crevices of tree trunks for food, but also those species that frequently feed from terrestrial ant hills such as Common Flickers (Colaptes auratus), Green Woodpeckers (Picus viridis), and Wrynecks (Jynx torquilla). Aside from gleaning and prob- ing, Skutch emphasizes other foraging methods found in the Picidae. Such methods include flycatching, perfected to an art by the Lewis' Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis), sapsucking, used extensively among the Sphyrapicus, and mast storing, most advanced in the Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus). Skutch repeatedly uses the word "drill" to describe the foraging techniques (and in referring to cavity excavation) of some woodpecker species. This term implies a twisting motion, and words such as "excavate" or "chisel" may be more appropriate.</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 57, No. 3 Recent Literature [255 Many woodpecker species live in treeless habitats. Ground Woodpeckers (Geocolaptes olivaceus) of Africa, and Andean Flickers (Colaptes rupicola) dig upward slanting burrows along roadside or stream banks in which to nest. Others, even in the presence of trees, occupy unwanted nest sites. Rufous Woodpeckers (Celeus brachyurus) of India, Ceylon, and southeastern Asia, excavate nest cavities in the oval nests of ants (Crematogaster) found in tree branches from 3-15 m above the ground. The ants, which attack other intruders, crawl over the woodpecker eggs and nestlings without harming them. Throughout the book, Skutch employs anthropomorphic phrases in describing the various habits and activities of woodpeckers. For instance he states, ". . . like us, they often seem to be impelled by an irresistible compulsion to work, carving more holes than they need, as we too often overwork ourselves to win superfluous goods." Although this is captivating prose, it leaves popular readers with false impressions about woodpeckers. Aside from his personal experiences, Skutch draws on the knowledge of such noted students of the Picid family as Lester Short, Lawrence Kilham, and L. de K. Lawrence, especially when referring to woodpeckers of North America. Nevertheless the author does present misinformation on a few of the North American species. For instance, he states that only two bird species, the Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus) and the Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), nest in all of the 49 mainland United States. Several species, including other woodpeckers, are equally wide-ranging. The range map of the major races of North- ern Flickers shows their boundaries bordering each other, but with no overlap. This is somewhat misleading since these races commonly interbreed in west-central North America. In referring to territory or range sizes of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) in the southeastern United States, Skutch's upper limit of 67 ha (167 acres) is somewhat conservative. Finally, the author, drawing on observations made by L. Kilham, states that those woodpeckers that nest in soft, rotting wood, easily accessed by predators and more apt to topple, such as Downy Woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens), have short nestling periods of about 3 weeks. On the other hand, those species that nest in firmer, more stable wood, such as Red-cockaded and Hairy (P. villosus) woodpeckers, tend to have longer nestling periods of about 4 weeks. I find this information somewhat inconsistent with my personal observations. For instance, the author states that Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) have a nestling period of 30 days, and yet this species often tends to nest in snags so rotten and unstable that they often collapse before the nesting season is complete. In the chapter on cavity usurpers, predators, and parasites, Skutch mentions the ag- gressive Tawny-winged Woodcreeper (Dendrocincla anabatina) as a threat to roosting Gold- en-naped (Melanerpes chrysauchen) and other tropical American woodpeckers. This small brown woodcreeper attacks woodpeckers flying to their roost cavities, striking them with eough force to cause feathers to fly. More often than not, a Golden-nape that encounters competition from a Tawny-winged Woodcreeper will lose its roost cavity to the latter. European Starlings (Sturna vulgaris) are probably the dominant usurper of woodpecker cavities in North America. The author mentions that Northern Flickers (yellow-shafted race) and Acorn Woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) are common victims of Starling competition for cavities, but fails to mention that Red-bellied (Melanerpes carolinus), Red- headed, and Hairy woodpeckers also frequently forfeit nest and roost sites to the persistent Starling. As brood parasites of woodpeckers, African honeyguides are very detrimental. Sharp egg teeth on both the upper and lower mandibles of honeyguide nestlings allow them to break unhatched eggs or to peck surrounding woodpecker nestlings to death, thus deriving full benefits from the woodpecker parents. In the final chapter, the author makes clear his stand on conservation. "Tree-destroying man," he states, is by far the greatest threat to the existence of many woodpecker species. Modern forestry practices do not favor woodpeckers or other cavity-nesting species since most trees are harvested long before they are habitable for nesting by the Picids. Even older dying and dead trees scattered throughout forests, parks, and suburbs are all too often cut without considering the role they play in the survival of various cavity nesting species. A world without trees and woodpeckers to inhabit them would indeed be an impoverished place. "Flourishing trees betoken a healthy environment, and woodpeckers are an index of the abundance of trees in all stages of their natural cycle of germination, growth, flowering, fruiting, and decay."</page><page sequence="3">256] Recent Literature J.

ROGER TORY PETERSON INSTITUTE CREATED The Roger Tory Peterson Institute for the Study of Natural History began full-scale operations this year with the hiring of its first President, Dr. Harold D. Mahan, former director of The Cleveland Museum of Natural History. The Institute's primary mission is to develop programs to increase the number of serious students of natural history. The Institute, located in Jamestown, New York, near Lake Chautauqua, has been des- ignated as the permanent repository for Roger Tory Peterson's artwork, correspondence, slides, movies, and other materials related to his remarkable lifetime achievements. A $5-million headquarters facility is currently being designed, with a mid-1988 opening projected. The building will contain permanent and temporary exhibit areas for wildlife art shows (Peterson and other artists), dramatic displays on world-wide natural history, a 400-seat auditorium with 70 mm film-capability, an extensive natural history library, and research collections of natural history materials. The Institute's staff will eventually include 45 scientists, program coordinators, writers, and editors, with a mission of developing a high-quality, unique program of natural history experiences and publications on a world- wide scale. Ultimately, the Institute will have facilities and programs throughout the United States. Early members will receive Field Guide to the Roger Tory Peterson Institute, a bi-monthly newsletter with articles on the progress of the Institute's construction and program devel- opment. All members will receive invitations to special events for groundbreaking and dedication of the Roger Tory Peterson Institute building, and notification of Institute pro- grams across the U.S. Information about the Institute and its membership program may be obtained by writing: Roger Tory Peterson Institute, 525 Falconer Street, Jamestown, NY 14701.
