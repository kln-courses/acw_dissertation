<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Archaeological Survey; and incorporated in Epigraphia Indo-Moslemica and its continu- ation Epigraphia Indica: Arabic and Persian Supplement. The first editor of the former periodical was in fact E. Denison Ross, the subsequent Director of SOAS. The history of Islamic epigraphy in the subcontinent is admir- ably summarized in the preface by Dr. Z. A. Desai, the retired Director (Epigraphy), ASI. Leading personalities and publications in the subject are mentioned, including manuscript works, and local Indian publications nowadays easily overlooked abroad. The story is carried down to the latest issue of EIAPS, for 1975 (issued 1983). Specially characteristic of the ASI in this field is the method of recording known as the' inked estampage '. The process, described here on p. 10, is simple and practical, easily accomplished by local helpers in out-of-the-way places, and requiring no costly and imported photographic apparatus. Yet it has been criticized, by the present reviewer amongst others, as tending to separate an inscription from its background (since the estampage will reproduce the one but not the other), and unable to record associated architecture and decoration. Such comments have some force in the study of inscribed Indian images. The estampages reproduced here are nevertheless superb specimens of the craft, and with Islamic epigraphy have the important merit that (p. 10) 'The impression thus closely approximates the original ink design that would have been prepared by the calligrapher for the stonecutter's use', and (p. 18) '... give a better idea of the calligrapher's original design than do some of the actual stone reliefs still in situ.' Indeed the examples shown here are striking, and must have been truly impressive when seen in the exhibitions at their natural size. Altogether 71 important Indo-Muslim monumental inscriptions are reproduced and described here, chosen as representative of dif- ferent calligraphic styles, historical periods, and regions. Of special value to students (since the periodicals are scarce, and laborious to work through) is Appendix I, listing authors and titles of all the articles printed in EIM and EIAPS up to the 1975 issue. There is also a list of relevant Western publications on p. 20. Appendix II gives the Arabic and Persian texts of the inscrip- tions, with English translations printed in the text. The volume is not just a beautiful produc- tion, but a real primer for the study. It provides as it were a summary 'statement of accounts' for the Indian survey of Arabic and Persian inscriptions. Recently reports have circulated that with Dr. Desai's retirement, there is danger that EIAPS could be discontinued. This volume itself shows the short-sightedness of such a policy, making evident that even without government support, the quality of the material will continue attracting scholarship. A. D. H. BIVAR GERD KREISEL: Die Siva-Bildkunst- werke der Mathurd-Kunst: ein Beitrag zur Friihhinduistischen Ikonographie. (Monographien zur Indischen Archaeologie, Kunst und Philologie, Bd. 5.) 289pp., 166 plates. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GMBH, 1986. DM 168. This is a revised and extended version of the author's thesis (Ikonographie der Siva-Bild- werke in der Kunst Mathuras, von den Anfdngen bis zur Spdtguptazeit) submitted to the Freie Universitat Berlin in 1981. Studies of the early Saivite art of Mathura have to rely mainly on material now available in museums and galleries since very few items indeed have survived as cult objects in situ, or even in what are now temple museums. The author has, however, successfully cast his net as widely as possible (London, Europe, America, even Israel, and several institutions on the sub- continent itself mainly the National Museum in Delhi, the Government Museum in Mathura and the State Museum in Lucknow) to give us a comprehensive picture of the history, the development, the iconographic significance and relevance of (as far as possible) all remaining examples (anthropomorphic and phallic) which originated in the ancient workshops of Mathura between the third century B.C. and the middle of the first Christian millennium. The book itself is well structured and thoroughly documented. It begins with an introductory part which discusses the basis and importance of image worship in Hinduism and the historical background of the concept and the figure of Siva, as well as the development of the ancient city of Mathura as a centre of gnostic bhakti worship which in turn sponsored the development of distinct artistic styles and modes of representation. The central part deals in detail with the pictorial representation of Siva; the iconographic elements and their sig- nificance; the divine figure itself, dress, hair- styles, emblems, gestures, jewellery, attributes; the various representations of the linga; and the significance and form of the sacred animals associated the Saivite cycle. Nearly half of the book is given over to the 'Katalog' consisting of some 500 excellent photographs, all preceded by detailed descriptions and analysis and very thorough bibliographical references. An excel- lent aid to the art historian as well as to the student of Indian religion. ALBERTINE GAUR DAVID J. KALUPAHANA: Ndgdrjuna. the philosophy of the middle way.
