Distributed in North America by Indiana Uni- versity Press. 155 pp., 1 color &amp; 9 blw photos, 84 b/w drawings, map, index. $50 hardcover. Reviewed by Arthur P. Bourgeois Between 1912 and 1919 the missionary Karl Edward Laman of the Swedish Covenant Church collected more than 100 minkisi objects among the Sundi Kongo, recording their indigenous names and the mission sta- tion at which they were collected. This was done within the context of Laman's research project to better understand Kongo thought and language. That project resulted in 429 manuscript notebooks written by Sundi Bakongo in their own language. Laman later edited this detailed ethnographic material and prepared a manuscript in Swedish. In turn, Sture Lagercrantz supervised the edit- ing and translation of Laman's work into English, and between 1953 and 1968 pub- lished four volumes under the title The Kongo. Wyatt MacGaffey, in the work under review, has isolated 45 minkisi (sing., nkisi) from the Laman collection at the Folkens Museum- Etnografiska in Stockholm, republished the line drawings of Lagercrantz's work and added five black-and-white photographs, and retranslated the informants' Kikongo text pertaining to the 45 minkisi objects. Ten of the Sundi authors are selected for brief biographical sketches in the introduc- tion. MacGaffey subsequently provides an overview on minkisi in general as well as discusses individual varieties at the begin- ning of each of the four chapters. Minkisi are presented as personalized forces from the land of the dead, chosen or induced to sub- mit to some degree of control through ritual performance. Control is exerted by a ritual expert termed an nganga, who may require the participation of others, varying from one person to perhaps a whole village or more. Songs, dances, behavioral restrictions, spe- cial enclosures, and material apparatus might also be required. A focal object, or nkisi, in addition to musical instruments, articles of costume, and cosmetics, becomes the embodiment of the entire context. This object is often a gourd, bag, box, pot, or snail-shell container, or a wooden figure to which a composite of medicine ingredients have been added. The composite generally contains grave dirt, white clay, or stones taken from a place where the spirit in ques- tion abides, thereby incorporating the nkisi spirit. Metaphorical materials are added whose names evoke the general capacities endowed to the nkisi as well as visual associ- ations that the nkisi is expected to produce. For example, both the tondo mushroom and the head of a viper may be used. The tondo 104</page><page sequence="2">mushroom elicits verbal associations of praise, while the viper head suggests that the nkisi strike its victim. So too, the wooden figure used as a container is part of the visu- al representation of the expected effect. Still other added materials direct the effect toward particular individuals. As MacGaffey is careful to detail, prob- lems in the classification of minkisi are readily apparent in Laman's Sundi notebooks. Because minkisi are grouped according to the animating spirit's origin in either earth, water, or air, only minkisi that embody bisimbi nature or local spirits are pertinent; those incorporat- ing spirits of ancestors or vengeful ghosts are ignored. In functional categories such as heal- ing, divination, and revenge, combinations are neglected in the effort to contrast func- tions. Categorization according to what appears to be nkisi family, as indicated by the names, is still another, but unsuccessful, approach. MacGaffey follows the classifica- tion used by Ntungu, one of Laman's infor- mants and the author of several notebooks, which mixes the principles of function and origin and ends with a miscellany. A chapter devoted to divination includes minkisi utilized to identify causes of misfor- tune attributed either to ancestral spirits, local or nature spirits, witches, or to the minkisi themselves. Divination through the nganga Mutadi, for example, entailed trem- bling, regarded as a sign of spirit possession. The mpiya flywhisk shook when the nganga Mutadi was "getting close." Identifying the nkisi responsible, the sufferer observed its rules, including food and behavioral avoid- ance, and perhaps made an offering. Generally he was initiated into a regular cult of that nkisi and admitted as its ritual spe- cialist, subsequently treating others afflicted by the same nkisi. This entitled the initiate to a valuable source of income in fees. By selecting a cause, the diviner determined a particular course of action and involved other ritual specialists. Witches identified by the diviner were subjected to an ordeal involving nkasa or mbundu vegetable poisons or the ordeal of the bau nkisi, in which a heated knife blade was applied to the sus- pect's leg. As demonstrated by the examples in this book, most Sundi divination minkisi consist of a bag of raffia cloth enclosing diverse contents, although no examination of contents is provided in this or subsequent chapters other than that reported in the Laman notebooks. Two figurative examples, mbongo nsimba and ngwima, present a mirror on the protruding stomach packet and are said to contain poisonous substances. Both minkisi derive from the Yombe rather than the Sundi. In the chapter on healing minkisi, their role in social relationships is noted: the rules for each healing nkisi specified membership in an association of those who shared similar symptoms. Initiation was the cure. For initia- tion commonly a shelter was constructed, charms were prepared, and specialized items such as bells, whistles, gongs, slit-drums, costumes, and other accoutrements intended for dramatic effect were used. Ecstatic pos- session would announce the presence and power of the spirit. Following this, the par- ticular nkisi was kept within either the owner's house or a special house of its own. The book treats twenty-one kinds of healing minkisi, most of them consisting of wrapped bundles, sacks, or necklace amulets of di- verse materials. The variety termed mbenza, associated with local bisimbi spirits, employs curiously shaped stones, and rocks only slightly modified to resemble the human form. All others are nonfigurative. Another chapter contains a discussion of minkisi used to obtain wealth and to make war. Such minkisi protected and promoted the male spheres: trade, hunting, and killing within the male domain of the forest. Ten varieties are given, ranging from beaded amulets and varied accessories carried by men expecting attack, to small bags with symbolic "guns" attached. Three examples present anthropomorphic figures. In the concluding chapter, attack minkisi, or minkisi intended to pursue unknown or suspected witches and used to sanction oaths, are treated. Visually, as objects, this variety is the most spectacular of the collec- tion. Known among the Kongo as early as 1698, attack minkisi (generally associated with the name nkondi) were more likely to include a human or animal figure. Infor- mation pertaining to five named varieties, one from the Yombe rather than Sundi, is the most complete of any in the book, including careful detail devoted to its origin, composition, utilization, accompanying ritu- als, and prayers. Basic similarities between Kongo nkisi cults as described by Laman's Sundi infor- mants and possession/curative cults further to the east in the Kwango region are strik- ing. Perhaps underlying cultural uniformity within the Kikongo linguistic subunit with regard to domestic traditions and concepts of misfortune and its remedy is to be expect- ed. Yet Laman's informants largely appeal to an etiological interpretation that attrib- utes the problem to nature spirits, malevo- lent ancestors, or the power of chiefs or elders likely reflecting the informants' mis- sionizing interests. The therapeutic and politico-judicial domains, although alluded to in the descriptions, are neglected as a stage upon which translineage nkisi cults perform. It is precisely within this sphere that current progress in medical anthropolo- gy has been made, particularly in the research of Renaat Devisch working among the Yaka and, although further afield, by Filip DeBoeck among the Lunda. The Laman collection, as presented in this work, rebalances collectors' past preoccupa- tions with only figurative examples of nkisi. Statuary may or may not have been central to the original nkisi, or may have lost significant accoutrements in the process of collecting. The Laman collection perhaps comes closer to a complete ensemble than any other collec- tion of Kongo material. Yet this slim text does not include all pertinent information provid- ed by the missionary. As noted in the intro- duction, "If a text is adequately presented in The Kongo, I-IV, it has not been repeated here" (p. 7). Similarly, a wealth of undocu- mented imagery is presented in The Kongo, now long out of print, that is not included in the work under review. MacGaffey makes no reference to stylistic relationships within Sundi material or to Raoul Lehuard's Art bakongo, Les centres de style (1989). Generally, Sundi forms have been appropriated from neighboring groups, either the Teke and Lari to the east or Yombe to the west. Lehuard's complaint about The Kongo, regarding its lack of precision in not- ing ethnic identity, is to some extent reme- died in this work. But as Lehuard notes (1989:603), Laman's attention was solely devoted to the place of use rather than the place of origin. The juxtaposition of minkisi with corre- sponding descriptive texts in Kikongo and in English translation provides unique doc- umentation of an exceptional collection and will remain a significant resource for students of African art, folklore, religion, and anthropology.
