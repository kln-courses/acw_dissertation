<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE USE AND NON-USE OF PNEUMA BY JOSEPHUS 1) BY ERNEST BEST Caledon, N. Ireland The Greek Bible normally translates the Hebrew ruach by pneuma (the principal departure is found when ruach is applied to the spirit of man). The two words ruach and pneuma, though possessing the same fundamental meaning, 'wind', differed widely in develop- ment 2); ruach possessed a range and depth of meaning not to be found in pneuma except where it had been affected by Jewish, and possibly also Iranian, influence. The equating of pneuma with ruach in the LXX must have produced a difficult concept for non-Semitic readers. How would an educated Jew have attempted to put over for Greek readers the meanings of ruach ? The LXX does not help us but Josephus, who sought in his Antiquities to interpret the Biblical history for such Greek readers, can give some assistance in answering the question. How then does he avoid or make use of the Biblical ruach/pneuma concept? The first ten books of the Antiquities are concerned with the sacred history which he re- arranges, digests or expands from time to time, but which on the whole he follows fairly closely. From I Samuel onwards he seems to have been mainly indebted to the Greek Bible, but in the earlier books he had preferred the use of the Hebrew text (or possibly an Aramaic Targum) as basis for his work 3). It must be realised that Josephus omits large portions of the Biblical history and so rewrites other parts that many instances 1) All references are to the Jewish Antiquities except where otherwise explicitly identified. The text used has been that of the LOEB edition, and where that has not yet appeared, that of NABER. 2) Cf. P. VOLZ, Der Geist Gottes; E. DE W. BURTON, Spirit, Soul, and Flesh; F.

Our concern is with those passages in which he either retains the word pneuma, or introduces it, or conveys what it means by either substituting another word or phrase or by rewriting the passage. It is obvious that some of the Biblical usages of ruach/pneuma cause him no difficulty. This is true when it means 'wind'. He retains its use in this sense in VIII, 346 - I Kings I8. 45; IX, 36 = 2 Kings 3. I7. With the LXX, he replaces ruach of the Hebrew in Dan. 2. 35 - X, 207; Dan. 8. 8 = X, 271 by &amp;vspoS 1). He uses pneuma on a number of occasions where it is not used at the precise point in Scripture, though it may occur in the context: II, 343, 349 (cf. Exod. I4. 21; I5. 8, Io); IX, 2I1 (cf. Jonah I. 4); X, 279. He uses it also in this sense in places where he is not dependent on the O.T., XII, 75; XIV, 28, XVI r7, 62; B. J. IV, 477. There is thus no tendency to avoid the use of the word in this sense. No occasions happen to arise in which Josephus is forced to decide whether to continue the use of ruach/pneumna in the sense of breath; outside the Biblically controlled passages he does so use it twice, viz, III, 29I (where he introduces it into the context of Num. io. I ff.) and XVII, I69. We postpone the discussion of I, 34 and III, 260. It is in those passages in which pneuma/ruach is referred to man that Josephus has made the greatest change. Where pneurna/ruach was equivalent to the personal pronoun in the original Josephus normally replaces it by the pronoun or by a pronominal or other phrae: VI, 360 = I Sam. 30. 12; VIII, 356-- I Kings 21. 5 (LXX 20. 5); VII, 173 2 Kdms. 13. 2I; III, 271 - Num. 5. I4, 30 (the spirit of jealousy becomes U?O -Ti -RXorutnoc); II, 75 = Gen. 4I. 8 (The M.T. text says that Pharaoh's ruach was troubled, the LXX says that his duXq was troubled, Josephus uses the parti- ciple X066(tvoq); V, 345 - I Sam. I.I5 (here the LXX has already changed the phrase). Very similar to the usage of ruach as thepersonal pronoun is its occurrence in 2 Chron. 36. 22 -- Ezra I. I, where it is said that the Lord stirred up the ruach of Cyrus; here Josephus XI, 3 follows the LXX in retaining the phrase but substitutes +uXZ for ruach. Josephus (XIII, 20I) replaces the pneuma of I Macc. 13. 7 by uXj', and in XI, 237 = Esther 5. Ie he 1) Theod. reads pneuma in Dan. 2.35 and ovsuLo in 8.8. 2I9</page><page sequence="3">ERNEST BEST uses 3LaOvoLc. We should note also at this point that the phrase recurring in DSS, 'to judge the spirits', I QS 5. 20-24; 6. 17; cf. 9. I4-I8; CD 20. 24, reappears in Josephus as -r qjOq 3ox .XLarzaL (B. J. II, 138). In one instance where ruach means 'anger' (Judges 8.3) this is made explicit by Josephus, V, 23I. In Esther 8. 12 m (16. 12) where pneuma is used of 'life' (to take a man's life) Josephus IX, 278 replaces it by uXq in accordance with Greek usage; cf. VIII, 325 = 3 Kdms. 17. 17 1). In I Chron. 28. 12 where pneuma/ ruach is used of 'mind' (the plans David had in mind), Josephus VII, 375 merely says that David gave the plans to Solomon; they are obviously David's plans and no ambiguity is left when we omit the mention of David's 'mind'. Josephus can also avoid the use of pneuma by a long or short paraphrase or by the omission of the clause in which it appears, thus showing his discomfort with it; XI, 8 = Ezra I. 5; IV, 40 = Num. I6. 22 (note his retention of the universal reference of the phrase); in VIII, I70 = I Kings Io. 5 =2 Chron. 9. 4 and IX, I02 = 2 Chron. 2I. i6 pneuma has already disappeared from the LXX. Josephus introduces pneuma at one place, XI, 240 = Esther 5. 2a, where it does not appear in our existing LXX text (= xapSoc); the usage here is undoubtedly Hebraic: sO3us uTcXCP (JLOL TO ToVEUiLoc l xoatXsL7XoLv U7O T uXfqS (cf. i Kings 10. 5 etc.). It may be that Josephus possessed a different Greek text at this point from ours or it may represent merely a lapse into a Jewish mode of thought; he was brought up a Jew and temporarily forgets his purpose to translate Jewish terms into Greek clothing. On one other occasion we find pneuma used of the human spirit, viz., B. J. III, 92,2) where he describes the Roman soldiers before battle as TLVo; ap7][ou rCVEiLooq 'UrO- TL[p7rcXL[?voL. We must remember that the Greek version of B.J. is based on an Aramaic original and this may be an oversight in the interpretative translation; it is also possible that o&amp;p'oS is to be given here its full value and understood not as 'martial', but as 'of the God, Ares'; we will see shortly that Josephus has no objection to speaking of men as possessed with the divine pneuma, and he prefers to say O0eov rxvuioa rather than 7rvecx 06so5; this may then 1) The Hebrew is here neshamah, which is in many respects equivalent to ruach; cf. BAUMGARTEL, op. cit., p. 362. 2) In B.J. III, 70-97 Josephus appears to be largely indebted to Polybius (VI, 19-42); but the precise reference to the shouting in III, 92 is not found in Polybius. 220</page><page sequence="4">THE USE AND NON-USE OF PNEUMA BY JOSEPHUS be a parallel in which he suggests that the Roman soldiers are filled with the spirit of Ares; it would not then be an example of pneuma in the human sense but in the divine. Two places into which Josephus has introduced pneuma seem to stand by themselves (i) III, 260 (-= Lev. 17. II), )uX)v acoTo (&gt;6 a4lto) xoc 7xV?U[to VOVLwoV. The Hebrew says that the nephesh of the flesh is in the blood and the LXX that the uX]? of all flesh is its blood; in both cases the reference is to all that lives, animals as well as men. In non-Biblical Greek there does not appear to be any connection of this nature between /uXq and blood, and this would be an exceedingly difficult phrase for the Greek thinker; contemporary Greek medical thought did however make a con- nection between pneuma and the blood 1). Pneuma is a corporeal term in Stoic thought and could therefore be related to blood. Probably it is then under Stoic influence that Josephus has inserted pneuma at this point and it is an attempt to explain this peculiar usage of uXj) to the Hellenistic world. (ii) I, 34 (= Gen. 2. 7), rcsu5pa o VXzV ocUTC xli UXV 2). Nephesh and PuX' appear in the Scripture in that man becomes 'a living soul' by this act of God. It was neshamah (7xvo) that God breathed into man; now nesha- mah is in large part equivalent to ruach 3) in the O.T. and this may have suggested to Josephus the use of pneuma here; further in Greek nTvoq is a purely physiological terrn without psychological over- tones like pneuma, but Gen. 2. 7 is more than a description of the physiological creation of man; hence Josephus' use of pneuma. This is re-inforced by the use of 4uuX ; to the Greek it is easier to say man has a soul than that he is one. So Josephus parallels pneuma and PuXZ hoping that they will explain each other. When the ruach/pneuma conception refers to God Josephus is more inclined to retain it than when it refers to man. We find that he has kept it in I, 27 = Gen. I. 2 4); IV, I8 = Num. 23. 7 (Josephus has here put the reference to the divine pneuma at the end of the speech rather than at the beginning as in the LXX; 1) Cf. G. VERBEKE, L'Evolution de la Doctrine du Pneuma, pp. 177 ff. Cf. Philo, Qu. in Exod. II, 59. 2) The statement of Gen. 2.7 that God breathed into the face of man dis- appears, presumably as too anthropomorphic. 3) Cf. note. 5. 4) Perhaps pneuma should be taken here as 'breath'; in the context, however, it is certainly a breath coming from God and it is thus easier to give it the full meaning 'spirit'. A Greek reader would be at liberty to take it as 'breath'. 221</page><page sequence="5">ERNEST BEST there is no reference to the Spirit at this point in the M.T. 1). VI, 222 I= Sam. 19. 20; VI, 223 = I Sam. 19. 23; X, 239 = Dan. 5.I4 (M.T. and Theod., but not LXX). We may note that in each case Josephus changes Txva[uoc 0eou to OZiov rxves5p (Except Gen. I. 2, where the possibility of change does not arise) 2). There are a number of points at which Josephus introduces pneuma where it does not occur in either M.T. or LXX at the exact point but does appear in the immediate context. (i) IV, io8 = Num. 22. I5 ff.; ruach occurs in the M.T. at 24. 2 and pneuma at 24. 2 and 23. 7 in LXX (A) 3). The part played by the divine spirit in this encounter of Balaam with the angel is difficult; Balaam riding on the ass approaches the angel; the ass is conscious of the divine pneuma; it is said that both angel and divine pneuma draw nearer to the ass; this may imply identification of the two and the divine spirit is here to be thought of as 'a spirit'; then the ass speaks with a human voice and we must assume that the divine spirit has entered it and so it has the gift of prophecy; then the angel speaks, and so appears to be regarded as distinct from the divine pneuma. The divine pneuma is in any case here connected with oracular speech. (ii) IV, II9 f. = Num. 23. 12. In Scripture Balaam attributes his prophetic speech to God; Josephus transfers the attribution to the divine pneumra; it is only on this occasion that he speaks of TO TOV 6sou rv?5toc instead of Oe0ov 7rvsUpLO, making it somewhat more personal. We may note again that Josephus emphasises more strongly than Scripture the passivity of Balaam and the compulsion to utter what is put in his mouth by the Spirit of God. (iii) VI, I66 - I Sam. I6. 14; but the reference to the divine pneuma in regard to David is found at I Sam. 16. 13. We may in passing note 1) ''his is an indication that at this point he is following the Greek rather than the Hebrew. We may observe also that he indicates here that when the Spirit seizes a man he is passive under it and his own desires and mind are overruled by it; cf. VI, 223. 2) A. SCHLATTER, Die Theologie des Judentums nach dem Bericht des Josefus, p. 58, notes this alteration as part of a general change in which Josephus avoids oyLog and substitutes OeZoq in such similar phrases as 0e6o YLosq, ?yyoq ?CytoqS. Such a general change hardly arises here as the O.T. rarely uses the phrase TrveiLa o &amp;yov though it is more common in the Rab- binic writings and in those of the Qumran Community. BURTON, op. cit., p. II6 argues that the phrase Oeiov Trveu5 was in use as early as 300 B.C. in non-Biblical Greek; cf. KLEINKNECHT, T.W.N.T. VI, p. 336 f. 3) This is one of the few places where ruach is not found in M.T. but the LXX introduces pneuma. 222</page><page sequence="6">THE USE AND NON-USE OF PNEUMA BY JOSEPHUS the disappearance from this passage of the evil ruach of Yahweh; Saul is said to be afflicted by T0rO twa v xoal 3aoLo6vLo. (iv) VIII, 408; the context of this is I Kings 22. 21-24 in which the ruach/ pneuma concept occurs. With the exception of I, 27 = Gen. I. 2 the divine pneuma is thus connected with the gift of oracular or pro- phetic speech. This was becoming an admissible usage of pneuma in Greek; it occurs frequently in Plutarch's discussion of the Delphic Oracle which is inspired by a breath coming from a cavern in the earth 1). In I, 27 pneunma plays no clear role; loyalty to such an important passage of Scripture demands its retention; a Greek could easily take it to mean 'wind' or 'breath'. The only genuinely new place into which Josephus introduces the conception of the divine pneumna comes in Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the Temple, VIII, 114 = I Kings 8. 27-30; 2 Chron. 6. 18-21; Solomon prays that Lpoo'pv TLva To ou0 7nvsU6- [ocToq may dwell in the Temple. Elsewhere Josephus refers to the dwelling of God himself in the Temple, III, Ioo, 202; VIII I02, Io6; B. J. V. 459. Judaism tended to speak of the Shekinah rather than of God as present in the Temple. Moreover in 'Jewish litera- ture the "holy spirit" frequently occurs in connections in which "the Presence" (shekinah) is elsewhere employed, without any apparent difference of meaning' 2). It is this which may have led Josephus to his choice of pneuma at this point preferring it to 'Shekinah', an even more difficult concept for the non-Jew. To the Stoic also pneuma was corporeal and hence it is possible to refer to a 'portion' of the pneuma 3). God is undoubtedly in heaven, all Solomon asks is that a portion of his spirit should dwell in the Temple. In this way Josephus attempts to overcome the gap between the conception of Heaven as God's dwelling place and his particular presence in the Temple-a difficulty which is felt particularly at this point in Solomon's prayer. However in the majority of instances Josephus has substituted some other phrase for the reference to the Spirit in the original; in most cases the substituted phrase retains a supernatural refe- rence. In a number of instances he sublimates an explicit mention of the spirit of God into a reference to prophecy, prophecy being a supernatural phenomenon well-known in the ancient world; 1) De defectu oraculorum, 432 ff. 2) G. F. MOORE, Judaism, I, p. 437. 3) Cf. SHOEMAKER, op. cit., p. 46, who argues that the quantitative con- ception is uppermost in Josephus' mind. 223</page><page sequence="7">ERNEST BEST IV, 165 = Num. 27. I8; V, 285 = Judges I3. 25 (It is odd that Samson has to be brought under the category of prophet); VIII, 295 2 Chron. 15. I; IX, 10 = 2 Chron. 20. I4; IX, I69 - 2 Chron. 24. 20. Josephus thus mentions prophets and prophecy both with and without reference to the divine spirit. The spirit is mentioned only in reference to prophets of the Biblical period; where he mentions prophecy outside that period he does not use the term pneuma 1). Where in I Sam. I0. 6; II. 6 Scripture speaks of the Spirit as coming on Saul, Josephus speaks of him as yev6VovoS ?vo0oq, VI, 56, 76. In V, I82 = Judges 3. Io Othniel is warned by an oracle. In V, 263 = Judges II. 29 Jephthah prays for victory. In Judges 15. 14 = V, 300 where Samson in the power of the spirit breaks his bonds, Josephus does not say that the spirit came on him but does attribute his strength to divine assistance (V, 30I). In I Sam. I6. 14 = VI, I66 where the M. T. and LXX speak of the Spirit of the Lord leaving Saul, Josephus says that To OZov abandoned Saul and passed over to David; we find a similar change in Dan. 6. 4 = X, 250: Josephus frequently replaces 6 0e6q by Or 0iov but the latter also represents the 'powers' which stand alongside God in the administration of the cosmos 2). It is possible to suspect that 7veu4La may have been omitted at an early stage in the development of the text. In Gen. 6. 3 = I, 75 the conception of the Spirit of God as abiding in man is written out of the text altogether: God condemns the people and then sends the flood. On a number of occasions where the ruach/pneuma conception refers to the giving of intelligence and understanding the super- natural reference completely disappears and the person described appears as wise or skilful in a purely human way (Gen. 41. 38 II, 87; Exod. 28. 3; 3I. 3; 35. 31 -- III, 200). Some references are so embarrassing that they dropped without leaving any trace: Judges 14. 6 - V, 287; Judges 14. I9 = V, 294 in which Samson 1) Cf. SCHLATTER, op. cit., p. 58. Josephus himself possessed the prophetic gift: B.J. III, 399-408; B.J. IV, 622-29. He attributes it to John Hyrcannus and to various Essenes: XIII, 299 f.; B.J. I, 69; B.J. VI, 300 ff.; B.J. I, 78-80; B.J. II, I59; Ant. XIII, 3II-313 etc. Cf. BUCHSEL, op. cit., pp. 95-8; E. FASCHER, IIPO(HTHZ, pp. 161-4; G. DELLING, Josephus und das Wunder- bare, N.T. 2 (1958) 29I-30I. Josephus also maintains that the series of pro- phets ended with the O.T.; cf. c. Ap. I, 41. This was a general position of Judaism. Yet spiritual gifts e.g. foretelling future events, continued; to meet this the Rabbis introduced the conception of the Bath Qol. 2) Cf. SCHLATTER, op. cit., p. 24. We may compare the use of VO6eoq of the prophets; VI, 56; B.J. III, 353. 224</page><page sequence="8">THE USE AND NON-USE OF PNEUMA BY JOSEPHUS is portrayed in the original as a charismatic hero; there is no means of transforming him into a prophet at this point. Likewise the reference to the transportation of Elijah by the spirit goes out: I Kings I8. 12 = VIII, 333. We may note however that when Saul appeared as a charismatic hero in i Sam. II.6 Josephus describes him as evOsoq yov6p[VOS, VI, 76; at IX, I83 Elisha is described as having 8uvaELLv OEicv. Josephus does not thus drop the idea that God can assist men other than by the enlightening of their under- standing, though he uses pneuma only of the latter. The increasing tendency in Judaism after the Persian period to use pneuma of disembodied spirits is also found in Josephus; this usage also appears in non-Biblical Greek 1). For the evil spirit which came on Saul Josephus retains pneuma (VI, 214 = I Sam. 19. 9 cf. VI, 2II, though he qualifies it with CXL,6VL0ov 2). At VI, I66, 8 = I Sam. I4-I6 the evil pneuma becomes r0QO Lvac xoc 8ayL6ovLa. In both cases he does not go along with the Bible in stating that the evil spirit came from God. At VI, 2II he introduces a reference to -To UTov7]poo 7?Ut Cvx TO xOC Tr&amp;V 8aLOVLcOV. In B.J. VII, I85, &amp;a apL6oVL are spoken of as the 7cv[laToc of the wicked dead which enter into the living; and in B.J. I, 69 he traces prophecy to TO 3olp6vlovv indicating how closely 8Oay6vLov and xveupa were asso- ciated in his mind. Micah's vision of the lying spirit entering the false prophets (I Kings 22. 21-23 = 2 Chron. I8. 20-23) is rewritten without mention of pneuma, the prophets being explicitly called 'false' (VIII, 406). Judges 9. 23 is also rewritten in V, 240 to remove the mention of pneuma. In conclusion we may say that pneuma is retained in the meanings which a Greek would easily accept, e.g. wind, breath. It virtually disappears where it is applied to the spirit of man; this is an ex- tension of a tendency already found in the LXX; the same occurs in Philo. When it applies to God we find Oeiov -XmveOc rather than xnrUva O9o 5; its usage here is almost completely restricted to prophecy and oracular speech and is used only of such within the Biblical period; when prophecy is discussed outside that period pneuma is never used. This restriction to prophecy both follows the general tendecy of post-Biblical Judaism and links up with Greek usage in Plutarch. 1) Cf. BURTON, Op. cit., p. 81. 2) On the use of the root a,cutov. with reference to good and evil spirits see H. St. J. THACKERAY and R. MARCUS, A Lexicon to Josephus, p. II9.
