De Gruyter/Herder, Berlin 2010, xxv + 341 pp. ISBN De Gruyter 9783110193442; ISBN Herder 9783451329012. €89.95. The promising series, "Orígenes: Werke mit deutscher Übersetzung" (OWD), opens with the volume here under review. Yet before examining this work, it might be helpful to orient readers to the leading contours of this series that, when complete, will have a lasting contribution on the field of Origenian studies. Under the editorial auspices of Alfons Fiirst and Christoph Markschies, the OWD aims to put into our hands a diglot of Origen's extant corpus. Each volume will reprint the corresponding text (less apparatus) of the editio critica maior. Most of these critical editions can already be found in the "Griech ischen Christlichen Schriftsteller" (GCS) series. Each volume in the OWD will also include a facing German translation, brief commentary on the text, and substantial introductions to the philological, historical, and theological aspects of the treatise in question (note the editorial plan for forthcoming volumes on p. xxv). The OWD forms a counterpart to the Italian diglot of Origen's writings begun nearly a decade ago under the supervision of the "Studi del Gruppo Italiano di Ricerca su Origene e la Tradizione Alessan drina." Now to the volume here under review. Origen composed homilies, a com mentary, and scholia (exegetical notes) on the book of Genesis. Rufinus's Latin translation of the Homilies on Genesis was first critically edited by W.A. Baeh rens for the GCS in 1920, and subsequently reprinted by L. Doutreleau in Sources Chrétiennes (SC 7bis). Metzler's book thus focuses principally on Ori gen's commentary and scholia. Our knowledge of the circumstances surround ing the composition of both of these works is modest. Origen began his thirteen-volume Commentary on Genesis while still in Alexandria. He com pleted the first eight books there, before moving to Caesarea Maritima in 231/232 where he shortly thereafter finished the remaining four books. The exegetical scope of the Commentary on Genesis was narrow: Origen interpreted only Gen. 1,1—5,1. As for his scholia on Genesis, they were presumably com posed after he completed the aforementioned commentary since they dealt with passages in Genesis not addressed in that work (we have fragments from the scholia on Gen. 5,3 through 49,9). Thus, the mostly Greek fragments Metzler gathers in this volume come principally from Origen's commentary and scholia on Genesis (with the distinct possibility that some come from the original Greek homilies on Genesis). At any rate, it is important to note the © Koninldijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012 DOI: 10.1163/18712428-09220009</page><page sequence="2">316 Book Reviews / CHRC 92 (2012) ioy-494 intentional ambiguity in the title of Metzlers book: it is devoted to Origen's "Genesiskommentierung" that is, to his exegetical work on Genesis drawn prin cipally from both his commentary and scholia on this book (incidentally, the publication of Origens Homilies on Genesis in the OWD occurred in summer 2011). In the Commentary Origen was mainly concerned with the themes raised in its opening chapters, namely the creation of the cosmos, the formation of humanity, and the Fall. He addressed a wide-range of theological topics, from astrology and determinism, to anthropomorphic depictions of God, to the relationships between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The format of the treatise was the well-established genre of questions-and-answers, in which he probed the text with queries (e.g. what precisely did the phrase, "In the beginning" [Gen. 1,1] mean, or to what did the "garments of skin" [Gen. 3,21] refer?). Not surprisingly, we find Origen displaying his vast philological acumen in his commentary, including proposing allegorical interpretations of the opening chapters of Genesis. Here his figurative renderings of paradise are particularly interesting (though as later readers such as Epiphanius would insist, also especially deficient). Metzler writes a 25-page introduction that orients readers to Origens exeget ical work on Genesis and the editions she relies upon in constructing her text. This is followed by her own edition, which sorts passages into two broad cat egories of evidence: testimonies (A-C) and fragments (D-E). The testimonies in A discuss the genres, titles, and designations of Origen's exegetical writ ings on Genesis; the testimonies in B concern the compositional history and scope of the Commentary on Genesis; the testimonies in C refer to the content of this work. The actual fragments gathered in D concern Gen. 1,1-5,1, and thus stem principally from the Commentary. The fragments in E concern Gen. 5,3—49,9, and thus come primarily from the scholia. Metzler also prints one fragment on Gen. 1,28 that she considers spurious (section F—see p. xxiv in her introduction for more on her criteria for establishing the authentic Orige nian provenance of a fragment). Metzlers volume closes with a bibliography and several useful indices. Metzlers edition and translation mark a notable advance in Origenian scholarship. To begin with, she offers us the most comprehensive compilation of fragments on Origen's commentary and scholia on Genesis (cf. Patrología Graeca (PG) 12, 45-145 and PG 17, 11-16 for the last such attempt). Next, the testimonies and fragments gathered in this volume are all critically edited. Here Metzler completes the editorial work already begun by others.

Finally, Metzler offers a new translation into German, a most welcome facet of the OWD project since it will surely help alleviate the driving concern behind this commendable series: to promote the actual reading of Origen.
