Copyright Â© 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT The frontal crash standard in the USA specifies that the full front of a vehicle impact a rigid barrier. Subsequently, the European Union developed a frontal crash standard that requires 40 percent of the front of a vehicle to impact a deformable barrier. The present study conducted paired crashes of vehicles using the full-frontal barrier procedure and the 40 percent offset deformable barrier procedure. In part, the study was to examine the feasibil- ity of adding an offset test procedure to the frontal crash standard in the USA. Frontal-offset and full-frontal testing was conducted using both the mid-size (50th percentile male Hybrid III) and the small stature (5th percentile female Hybrid III) dummies. Five vehicle models were used in the testing: Dodge Neon, Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Venture and Ford Contour. In the crash tests, all dummies were restrained with the available safety belt systems and fron- tal air bags. Both dummy sizes often exceeded the allowable lower leg injury criteria both in the offset tests and the full-fron- tal tests. Lower leg injury occurrences in real world crashes, based on National Automotive Sampling System data, show that many lower leg injuries occur in both full- frontal and offset type crashes. The results also showed that vehicles with a stiffer occupant cage did well in the offset test. In addition, the test data suggested that the small female dummy may be exposed to a high risk of neck injury if positioned close to the deploying air bag. INTRODUCTION For frontal crashes, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) assesses the occupant protec- tion capabilities of a vehicle under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208, Occupant Crash Pro- tection. This standard typically involves a full-frontal bar- rier impact at 48 kmph to evaluate the injury risk to the occupant's head, chest, and femurs. In addition, in 1978, NHTSA established a consumer information program, called the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). The NCAP assesses any additional reserve of occupant pro- tection by conducting a frontal crash test at 56 kmph. [1] Over the years, occupant crash protection has been sig- nificantly increased. Based on FMVSS No. 208 and NCAP, the average head injury criterion (HIC) and chest readings have been significantly reduced. These lower HIC and chest readings suggest a reduction in the proba- bility of serious head injury. Similarly, a reduction in fatal- ity rates (fatalities per 1 00 million vehicle miles traveled) was observed in the USA from 1979 through 1996. [2] Currently, neither FMVSS No. 208 nor NCAP assesses injury risks to the lower leg. Safety experts have noted that lower-extremity trauma is strongly associated with disability. Luchter found that - in police-reported towaway motor vehicles crashes in the USA - lower extremity injuries resulted in 41 percent of life-years lost to injury and 17 percent of total societal costs. [3] Miller et al. estimated that lower limb injuries are the second largest component of nonfatal highway crash costs. They found that for drivers and right front seat passengers in frontal collisions with no rollover or ejection, lower limb injuries cost $8.2 billion per year. [4] In addition, Pletchen et al. studied the trauma of 143 belted drivers of Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and found that the trauma of the lower extremities was ranked second highest in injury costs. [5] Morgan et al. exam- ined the 1979 - 1986 NASS files for frontal crashes and determined that lower extremity traumas are about 26 percent of the total moderate or greater injuries (AIS 2) for both belted and unbelted occupants. [6] Stucki et al. studied the NASS crash data files for the years 1988 - 1993 and again found that in frontal crashes, approxi- mately 25 percent of AIS 2 injuries are to the lower extremities. [7] 1483</page><page sequence="2">Mercedes-Benz and Volvo have evaluated various fron- tal-offset tests. Grosch et al., of Daimler-Benz, studied passenger car intrusion in frontal crashes. For a passen- ger car to withstand vehicle intrusion, they believed that an occupant cage must be sufficiently stiff. They sug- gested that, to reduce injury related to vehicle intrusion, it is essential to conduct appropriate crash tests such as offset collisions with an overlap of less than 40%. [8] Planath-Skogsmo et al., of Volvo, studied the differences in various types of frontal crash tests. From their study, they found that to assess the vehicle structural proper- ties, either a severe partial overlap collision or Offset Deformable Barrier (ODB) tests can be used to comple- ment the existing full-frontal barrier test. [9] Investigators suggested that a frontal-offset test would be a suitable test protocol to assess vehicle structural integ- rity and that the offset test complements the full-frontal test. In the United Kingdom, the Transport and Road Research laboratory conducted an investigation based on real world crashes. They said that despite the use of seat belts, frontal impacts pose the greatest threat to car occupants due to vehicle intrusion. The U.K. study sug- gested that there is a need for a test in which the barrier is offset and a deformable impact face is used. [10] In the USA, beginning in 1995, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (MHS) initiated a program using a frontal- offset test to rate safety in cars. This ongoing frontal-off- set testing program evaluates the crashworthiness of new model vehicles crashed at 64 kmph (40 mph) into a deformable barrier. Based on their experience, IIHS indi- cated that a full-width frontal test and a frontal-offset test complement each other; a full-width test is especially demanding of restraints, while the offset test is demand- ing of the structural integrity of a vehicle. [11] Recently Australia and Japan have both studied the European Union (EU) offset test protocol. In 1996, Aus- tralia studied the benefits of a frontal-offset regulation. In their study, they found that adding the EEVC frontal-offset requirement to Australia's Federal Office of Road Safety (FORS) dynamic full-frontal crash standard (ADR 69, similar to FMVSS No. 208), would be highly beneficial and cost effective. [12] Also in Japan, since April 1993, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) has been researching a frontal-offset test procedure similar to Directive 96/79 EC. Under the current EU offset protocol, Directive 96/79 EC, a vehicle is crash tested at 56 kmph. However, many safety experts have recommended a higher impact speed. In 1997, the Canadian Government carried out a test program to validate the 40% offset test procedure designated in Directive 96/79 EC. Four separate passen- ger cars were crashed at a speed of 56 kmph and at a higher speed of 60 kmph. For that study, at the impact speed of 60 kmph, the lower leg readings exceeded the allowed tibia criteria of the EU Directive three times out of eight. [13] REAL WORLD FULL-FRONTAL AND OFFSET- FRONTAL CRASHES The National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) col- lects detailed data on a statistical sample of light passen- ger vehicles (passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles) towed because of damage received in a police-reported traffic crash. [14] During the eleven years from 1988 to 1998, NASS researchers investigated 29,664 light passenger vehicles towed from the scene because of damage received in a nonrollover frontal crash (which was identified in terms of the general area of damage for the most severe impact to that vehicle). The NASS data can be used to describe the national dis- tribution of frontal crash types in the United States. Fron- tal crash types were defined from the fourth column of the Collision Deformation Classification (CDC), the Spe- cific Horizontal Location (SHL), following the guidelines of the Society of Automotive Engineer's Recommended Practice SAE J224 MAR80. "Full-frontal impacts" were defined as those that involve damage distributed across the front of the vehicle (SHL = "D"). "Narrow impacts" were defined as those that involve no more than the cen- ter third of the vehicle's front face (SHL = "C"). "Frontal- offset crashes" were defined as all other types of frontal crashes. NASS produces estimates that 42 percent of towaway frontal crashes are full-frontal, 56 percent are frontal-off- set (either left-offset or right-offset), and 2 percent are narrow impacts to the center of the vehicle front (Figure 1). NASS estimates include both sampling and nonsam- pling errors. The national estimates presented here should be considered preliminary because confidence intervals have not been calculated for these estimates. Figure 1 . Distribution of frontal crashes in the USA by type (weighted data) 1484</page><page sequence="3">A subset of frontal crashes was selected to study injury patterns among belted occupants. The data were restricted to belted front seat occupants who were at least fifteen years old (and so, "adult-sized") and who were not ejected from the vehicle. The study used 21 ,51 7 investigated NASS cases that met these criteria. For the full-frontal and the offset crashes in Figure 1 , what is the risk of trauma to the parts of the body? Five body regions were considered in the analysis: (1) Head (head, face), (2) Neck, (3) Thorax (abdomen, chest, back, and shoulder), (4) Arm (wrist, hand, elbow, upper arms, and forearm) and (5) Lower extremity (pelvis, knee, lower leg, thigh and ankle/foot). The trauma risk was compared using the idea of injury risk. The injury risk is defined as: Injury Risk = occupants with injury to the specified body region divided by total no. of occupants in that type of crash Figure 2 shows the injury risk for AIS (Abbreviated Injury Scale) injury 2, for both the full-frontal and offset crashes. [1 5] Figure 3 shows similar results for AIS 3 injury risk. These data suggest that head/face, thorax and lower extremity generally have the highest risk of occupant injury. Injury risk for the full-frontal is often greater than the injury risk for the offset crash. (On the other hand, changing the statistic slightly for the offset crashes gives a different picture. Calculate the frequency of injury to occupants on the offset side divided by the total number of occupants on the offset side. Then the likelihood of receiving an AIS 2 or AIS 3 injury in the offset crash is the same order of magnitude as in the full-frontal crash.) Figure 2. AIS 2 or greater injury for belted occupants in full frontal and offset crashes (weighted NASS data) Figure 3. AIS 3 or greater injury for belted occupants in full frontal and offset crashes (weighted NASS data) Both Figure 2 and 3 indicate the neck is not frequently injured. Sometimes there is a special health problem that is not illustrated by the national real world crash statistics. Since early 1970, the NHTSA has gathered detailed engineering information on real world crashes of special interest. By 1 997, the Special Crash Investigations had documented 22 crashes in which the deploying air bag likely contributed to the fatality of the driver. [16, 17, 18] Many of the 22 cases involved a small stature female sit- ting close to the driver air bag at the time of deployment. The air bag was associated with basilar skull fracture and associated brainstem laceration. Hopper et al. have sug- gested basilar skull fracture and upper cervical injuries are correlated with neck tension and an extension moment calculated at the occipital condyle. [19] Figures 2 and 3 show that thorax injuries are common in towaway frontal crashes. An estimated 2.9 percent of drivers in full-frontal crashes receive at least one AIS 2 thorax injury. The injury rate is estimated as 1 .6 percent for AIS 2 in offset crashes, 1.2 percent for AIS 3 in full- frontal crashes, and 0.5 percent for AIS 3 in offset crashes. The FMVSS 208 compliance test measures the chest acceleration and the central chest deflection. This instrumentation is designed to address the torso trauma. For the lower extremities, the FMVSS 208 test measures the femur loads. FMVSS 208 does not address the lower leg portion of the lower extremity at all. Figures 2 and 3 show the estimated risk of injury, but do not indicate the total size of the injury problem associated with each frontal crash type. Figure 4 shows that an esti- mated 61 percent of AIS 2 lower extremity injuries occur in full-frontal crashes. Figure 5 shows that for AIS 3 inju- ries, 59% are full-frontal. 1485</page><page sequence="4">Figure 4. AIS 2 Lower extremity injuries (weighted NASS data) Figure 5. AIS 3 Lower extremity injuries (weighted NASS data) Many of the NASS cases record the V of the crash. Fig- ures 6 and 7 show the injury risk (AIS 2) the V as determined by the NASS investigators using a recon- struction computer program(CRASH3). For full-frontal crashes, the risk of AIS 2 trauma is roughly 19 percent for the lower extremity at a V of 48 kmph. Before inter- preting the risk of offset-frontal, a word of caution is due. Some researchers have concluded that - for offset crashes - the V estimates systematically underestimate the actual change in velocity. This underestimation is an artifact of using the CRASH3 computer program. For six- teen mid-size passenger cars, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (MHS) conducted 40 percent offset crashes into a deformable barrier at 64 kmph. [20] IIHS then calculated the V using the procedures specified for CRASH3. They found that the CRASH3 V was lower than the actual V by about 25 percent. Subsequently, Stucki and Fessahaie investigated both car-to-car and car-to-deformable barrier impacts of IIHS and NHTSA crash tests. [21] Stucki and Fessahaie found that the CRASH3 V in a 40 percent frontal-offset crash was lower than the actual V by about 28 percent. When the offset was 75 - 100 percent, Stucki and Fessahaie found the CRASH3 V and the actual V to be the same. Nolan et al. cautioned ". . . it is imperative that investigators study- ing the relationship between such tests be aware of the CRASH3 bias." [22] For offset-frontal crashes, the risk of AIS 2 trauma is roughly 20 percent for the lower extrem- ity at 45 kmph.

Offset-frontal NASS data for belted front- outboard occupants For the past twenty years or so, most crash testing for standards and consumer information has been done with a mid-size adult crash test dummy (50th percentile male Hybrid III). Occupant injury in relation to stature was examined for real world crash data. Height was known for 1 7,954 front seat occupants in the NASS study. Fig- ure 8 shows that injury risk is distributed evenly across the short, medium, and tall stature adult. (This figure does not distinguish between full-frontal and offset crashes but aggregates them together as frontal crashes.) 1486</page><page sequence="5">8 1 A 7 Ã§o &lt; 6 - JZ 'I 5 - Tall I 4 Short Driver g- Driver Driver 8 3 - o o 2 - -o 0s 1 J - I 1 - I - I 1 - I - I 1 - I 141-160 161-180 181-200 Front Seat Occupant Height (cm) Figure 8.

The data in Figure 9 suggests that injury risk to the five body regions is similar for short and medium occupants. If one size occupant accounts for most of the trauma, then logic would lead the safety community to test with just that size dummy. The real world crash data tell us that is not the case. The small stature occupant has roughly the same risk as the mid-size occupant. Figure 9. Distribution of AIS 2+ Injuries for belted front seat occupants of different stature NHTSA'S FRONTAL-OFFSET HARMONIZATION STUDY In September of 1996, Congress directed NHTSA to con- duct a feasibility study toward establishing a Federal motor vehicle safety standard for frontal-offset crash test- ing. [23] To follow this directive, NHTSA evaluated the European frontal-offset protocol, Directive 96/79/EC. The configurations of the FMVSS No. 208-belted test and the European Parliament adopted Directive 96/79 EC frontal 40% offset test are shown in Figures 10 and 11. In short, "208" is a full-frontal crash into a rigid barrier test and "EU" is an offset-frontal crash into a deformable bar- rier. The test conditions and injury criteria prescribed in the FMVSS No. 208 standard and the EU Directive 96/ 79/EC often differ. These differences and similarities are listed in Table A1 of Appendix A. Figure 1 0. FMVSS No. 208 full frontal test Figure 1 1 . EU Offset test Previous research into frontal crash protection has sug- gested that the size of the occupant may be important in determining the safety value of different frontal crash pro- cedures. [7] In August 1996, the agency was petitioned to change the testing specifications of FMVSS No. 208. Among other items, the petition requested the use of the small stature adult dummy (5th percentile female Hybrid III dummy) in FMVSS No. 208. [24, 25] Subsequently, a seating procedure was established for the small female dummy. [26] 1487</page><page sequence="6">The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate potential benefits of adopting the frontal-offset test as a supple- ment to FMVSS No. 208 and (2) evaluate the use of the fully restrained small stature dummy in both the full-fron- tal test and the offset-frontal test. Testing began in 1997. In June 1998, about half way through the testing, a status report was presented. [27] All testing was completed in 1999. CRASH TESTS CONDUCTED FOR THIS STUDY Comparison of the frontal-offset test was performed for five different make and models. Tested vehicles were the 1996 Ford Taurus, 1996 Toyota Camry, 1998 Chevrolet Venture, 1998 Ford Contour, and the 1998 Dodge Neon. All model year1998 vehicles came equipped with rede- signed air bags. In all crash tests, dummies were restrained with available safety belt systems and frontal air bags. In each test of their respective vehicle, engi- neers from Chrysler, Ford, Toyota, and GM helped NHTSA with the seating of the small stature dummy and actively participated in the test setup. To meet the objectives of this study, the test matrix shown in Figure 12 was followed. Each of the five vehicles was tested in a full-frontal crash and in an offset-frontal crash, for a total of ten crashes. These ten crashes were done with a fully restrained mid-size dummy in the driver and right front seat passenger position. Each test was then conducted again with a small stature dummy in the driver and right front seat passenger position, for a final total of twenty crash tests.

Test matrix used for the frontal crash study MEASUREMENT OF DUMMY RESPONSES All laboratory testing used the full instrumentation pack- age for both the mid-size male and small female Hybrid III dummies. For the reader not familiar with the Hybrid III dummy, the Society of Automotive Engineers has written a book on the subject. [28] Figure 13 shows a schematic of some instrumentation. The lower tibia load cell was important to this study. The instrumentation for the neck loads is described in both Reference 28 and in Park et al., which analyzed the neck responses of the mid-size dummy in the frontal NCAP testing. [29] To compare the various crash tests, the dummy readings were evaluated using the Injury Assessment Reference Values (IARV) and injury criteria developed for measure- ments made with the Hybrid III family of adult dummies. [30, 31] The lARVs for the small stature and mid-size dummies are listed in Table 1. (Research and analysis activities are continuing to examine existing biomechani- cal data and to develop additional data which may lead to changes and improvements in methods of determining injury risks.)

No dummy readings exceeded the IARV in either test type. This was true for both the small stature and mid-size dummy. (All dummy readings, for the test matrix shown in Figure 12 are tabu- lated in Tables A3 through A6 of Appendix A.) Lower leg readings for the full-frontal test were compared with the offset test results for both dummy types. Figurei 4 shows lower leg reading comparisons for the full-frontal test. The values recorded for the Camry and Taurus were very low. By contrast, the Neon, Contour and Venture exhibited high tibia moments. Figure 15 shows lower leg reading comparisons for the offset test. Only the Taurus exhibited low tibia readings. The other four vehicles had high tibia readings. For the full-frontal and offset-frontal crash tests, leg readings exceeded the allowable limit The results from the full-frontal crash test results were compared with the real world crashes. The rate at which the lower leg readings exceed the IARV is (in the five makes and models tested in the laboratory) slightly more than twice the rate at which occupants are injured in real world crashes. In Figure 6, NASS data suggested ( by linear interpolation) that the risk of AIS 2 trauma is roughlyl 9 percent for the lower leg at 48 kmph. Forty-two percent (eight occupants out of nineteen) of lower leg readings for the occupants (both dummy types) exceeded the IARV when the vehicles were crash tested at 48 kmph. In short, the full-frontal laboratory tests with the five make and models, several of which were chosen to produce high lower leg readings, show a definite risk at a slightly higher level than the real world data. Similarly, the results of the offset crash tests were com- pared with the real world crashes. Laboratory crash test data showed that about 41% (seven occupants out of seventeen) exceeded the allowable limits. As shown in Figure 7, 20% is the risk, for offset crashes, at 45 kmph, if a correction factor (increase the CRASH3 V by about 33% as recommended by Reference 20, 21 , and 22) is used. In short, at an equivalent V, the injury predicted in the laboratory is a little more than twice the AIS two injury rate in the NASS. Figure 14. Comparison of lower tibia bending moments of the mid-size dummy and the small stature dummy in the FMVSS No. 208 test. Figure 1 5. Comparison of lower tibia bending moment of the mid-size dummy and the small stature dummy in the offset test. 1489</page><page sequence="8">In summary, the analysis showed that lower limb injuries occur in the real world in great numbers, in both full-fron- tal and offset crashes. In the laboratory testing, the lower legs of the dummies in the full-frontal crashes often exceeded the IARV (for the five makes and models tested) about twice as often as in the real world crashes. In the offset barrier crashes, the dummy's lower legs exceeded the IARV (for the five makes and models tested) aboout twice as often as in the real world crashes. Based on the results of the agency's testing, it appears that adding the offset test protocol to FMVSS No. 208 could yield important benefits. Accordingly, the agency should proceed quickly to resolve the remaing issues identified in its 1997 report to Congress. [32] IDE PAN INTRUSION IN THE FULL-FRONTAL AND OFFSET-FRONTAL CRASHES - Measurements of static intrusion were compared with the lower leg read- ings. Figure 16 shows the normalized values of the lower tibia bending moment and the axial force with the corre- sponding static intrusion. The data in Figure 16 shows various lower leg readings at three different levels of intrusion. (The details of the toe pan measurement are shown in Figure A2 and the values are tabulated in Table A7 of Appendix A.) The balance of this section discusses these three different levels of intrusion as three regions. Figure 1 6. Normalized lower tibia bending moments and normalized axial forces versus corresponding averaged static intrusions. In the first region, vehicles with very low intrusion (less than 60 mm), such as in the Taurus, had low leg readings in the lower leg assessment. Lower leg readings for Tau- rus were also very low for both dummy sizes. The magni- tude of intrusion (into the occupant compartment) for the Taurus was significantly lower relative to others. The structural crush in the Taurus was in the front, between the front bumper and the firewall. The crush of the occu- pant cage was small. The authors feel that the Taurus did well in the full-frontal crash because the front was soft and the Taurus did well in the offset crash test because of the stiffer occupant cage. In the second region, vehicles with moderate intrusion (100 mm to 150 mm) had high tibia bending moments above the IARV; mainly these high readings came from the full-frontal tests. These moderate intrusions were observed from the four vehicles except the Taurus. Because the occupant compartment intrusion does not appear to be large enough to crush or severely bend the legs, the bending moment may be due to impact forces being translated through the front structure to the lower legs. One interpretation to put on the behavior of these full-frontal barrier tests (in the middle region) is that if the front-end had been softer and absorbed enough energy, these tibia bending moments would have been lower. Then, these data points would have moved to region one. In the third region, vehicles with severe intrusion (greater than 150 mm) generally performed poorly in the lower leg assessment. The vehicles that had high intrusion, such as the Neon, the Contour and the Venture, exhibited high tibia bending moments. The lower leg readings above the IARV were from the offset tests. In these cases, the intrusion was so large that, in many cases, the dummy legs were trapped and were physically damaged from the intrusion. One interpretion to put on the lower leg bend- ing moments that failed in the offset crashes is that the occupant cage needed to be stiffer relative to the front structure. In summary, high lower leg readings (above the allowable limit) occur in regions of moderate and high intrusion. Lower leg injuries can be avoided, in either the full-frontal or the offset crashes, if the dummy readings can be shifted to region one. This study suggests that a vehicle had a soft front design with a stiffer occupant cage will shift to region one. In other words, these data suggest that both the full-frontal and the offset-frontal can be used together to guide the vehicle design that will give lower leg readings in the crash test dummy. MID-SIZE DUMMY VERSUS SMALL STATURE DUMMY - The mid-size dummy readings were com- pared with the small stature dummy to see whether differ- ent injury risks exist. As discussed before, for the HIC, 1490</page><page sequence="9">chest acceleration, chest deformation and femur evalua- tion, no reading exceeded the IARV. Lower leg readings of the small stature dummy were compared with the mid-size dummy. As discussed ear- lier, (in Figures 14 and 15) many lower tibia readings exceeded the allowable limit in both the mid-size dummy and the small stature dummy. Neck readings for the driver and right front passenger dummies were examined for the frontal tests. Both mid- size and small stature dummy neck readings were nor- malized in accordance with the lARVs in Table 1. Table A8 of the Appendix tabulated the distance of driver's chest to the steering wheel and the distance for passen- ger's chest to the dash. After comparing the neck data against the five neck criteria, it was found that most of high neck readings were due to neck extension. Figure 17 shows normalized neck extension readings for the driver dummy versus the distance from the driver's chest to the center of the steering wheel. The data showed that nine female neck readings out of ten exceeded the allowable limit. In addition, two male (mid- size dummy) neck readings out of eight exceeded the allowable limit from both test types. The small stature dummy was typically seated closer to the air bag than the mid-size dummy. Film analysis showed that many of the female high neck loading occurred when the head and neck of the small stature dummy was in close proximity to the air bag at deployment. (Film review showed no evi- dence of the air bag getting caught in the dummy's chin during air bag deployment.) Figure 17. Normalized neck moment vs. the distance from driver's chest to the center of the steering wheel. Figure 18 shows the passenger dummy normalized neck extension readings versus the distance from the chest to the dash. The data showed that three small stature pas- senger dummy readings were above the IARV. Con- versely no male dummy readings exceeded the allowable limit. (Film review revealed no evidence of the air bag get- ting caught in the dummy's chin during air bag deploy- ment.) Figure 1 8. Normalized neck moment vs. the distance from driver's chest to the center of the steering wheel. In short, the small stature dummy had normalized neck extension readings above the IARV. The high neck read- ings occured when the dummy was close to an air bag at deployment. Small stature dummies were positioned based on the SAE seating procedure discussed earlier. The small stature dummy was seated in the full forward position of the seat with the seat back angle set to the manufacturer's recommended design value. These seat- ing positions, especially for the driver of small stature, are often close to the air bag at deployment. As discussed in the section on real world crash statistics, small stature occupants seated too close to the air bag do suffer severe neck trauma, just as the neck readings for the small stature dummy in the laboratory tests exceeded the IARV. In the real world, a small stature occupants may sit differ- ently than the small stature test dummy in this study. Manary et al. reported that the small stature dummy seat- ing procedure typically puts the small stature female too far forward relative to humans. [33] In addition, NHTSA has been advocating that drivers should seat themselves with at least ten inches distance between their chest and the hub of the steering wheel (center of the air bag mod- ule), in order to prevent potential injuries from a deploying air bag. In summary, for Head Injury Criteria, chest acceleration, chest deformation, and femur loading, no big difference was found for the two dummy sizes. In the lower leg com- parison, many readings from both dummy sizes exceeded the IARV. In the comparison of neck readings, many small stature driver readings exceeded the IARV. These laboratory findings are consistent with the real world crash experience ( Special Crash Investigations) for the small stature occupants. These findings suggest that adding the small stature dummy to normal laboratory testing will work to protect a greater part of our popula- tion. 1491</page><page sequence="10">V. CONCLUSIONS In the real world frontal crashes, the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) data showed that an estimated 42 percent of frontal crashes are full-frontal crashes, and 56 percent are offset crashes. A study of injury patterns among belted occupants suggest that the head/face, tho- rax and lower extremities generally have a higher fre- quency of injury than other body parts in frontal crashes. For lower extremity AIS 3 injuries , 59% occured in full- frontal and 40% occured in offset-frontal crashes. How- ever, these data show that the neck has a low frequency of trauma. Distribution of injuries to short, medium, and tall occupants (broken down by whole body or by the five body regions) suggest that injury risk is the same for short stature and mid-size occupants. The frontal crash standard in the USA specifies that the full front of a vehicle impact a rigid barrier. The European Union developed a frontal crash standard that requires forty percent of the front of a vehicle to impact a deform- able barrier. The present study conducted paired crashes of five vehicles using the belted full-frontal bar- rier procedure and the forty percent offset deformadle barrier procedure. In part, the study was to examine the feasibility of adding an offset test procedure to the frontal crash standard in the USA. The results for the full-frontal test were compared with the offset-frontal test. For the HIC, chest acceleration, chest deformation, and femur evaluation, no readings exceeded the IARV. However, in the evaluation of lower leg readings , many lower leg readings exceeded the allowable limit in both full-frontal and the offset tests. The lower leg readings in the crash test showed a definite risk of injury as in the real world data. For the injury rate of the lower leg, in the full-frontal crashes, NASS sug- gested that 19% of cumulative AIS 2 trauma can occur at a delta v of 48 kmph. The laboratory crash test results for five makes and models showed 42 percent exceeded the Injury Assessment Reference Value (IARV). For the off- set type crashes, NASS data suggested that 20% of AIS 2 trauma can occur at a delta v (corrected) of roughly 60 kmph. The laboratory crash data showed 41% exceeded the IARV. The small stature dummy readings were compared with the mid-size dummy. Again, HIC, chest, and femur read- ings were below the IARV for both dummy sizes. In the lower leg evaluation, again, many lower leg readings from both dummy sizes exceeded the allowable limit. How- ever, neck comparison showed that 90% of small stature driver dummy's neck reading exceeded the limit. Film analysis showed that the small stature dummy was seated close to the air bag deployment. Based on real world crash data and laboratory testing of five makes and models, this study suggests three changes to frontal testing could yield import benefits. First, the lower leg instrumentation and criteria could be incorporated into both full-frontal and offset-frontal crash testing. Second, the offset-frontal crash test could be used to complement the full-frontal crash test. Third, the small stature dummy could be used in both the frontal crash tests to evaluate risk to that part of the overall pop- ulation.

Unlike the current separate injury criteria, this injury criteria account for the superposition of loads and moments and additive effect on injury risk. Table A9 shows calculated Nij value for driver and passenger for all tests. Nij was calculated as follows. Nlj=Fz/Fint + My/Mint where Fz is the axial load, Fint Is the critical intercept value of load used for normalization, My is the flexion / extension bending moment, and Mint is the critical intercept value for moment used for normalization. Detail description and a computer program for calculating Nij is currently in the NHTSA web site (www.NHTSA.dot.gov). 1501</page></plain_text>
