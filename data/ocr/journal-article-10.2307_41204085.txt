<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shelley: Values and Imagination BENNETT WEAVER Assistant Prof essor y Department of English Language and Literature y University of Michigan contemplating our world, which in simple faith we have given over to the administration of practical men and men of com- mon sense, we have come to know either that these men have not been practical enough, have not used enough common sense, or that they have actually lacked certain qualities of mind which are necessary to our corporate safety and satisfaction. As individuals we are being driven to seek the old and perhaps eternal centers of power within ourselves} as nations, in our more desperate moments, we seem to be wallowing our way toward chaos and the illimitable abyss. We have been sweeping forward with such fearful speed that neither as persons nor as peoples have we had time to pitch our tents before the watch-towers of the dawn. We have seen many a strong knight lying upon his broken lance beside some fort of folly and we have gone on in our weariness, sick with the chatter of the battlements, dead sick with the long contention about swans and geese. Still it is the faith of some of us that in poetry of that imaginative sort which perceives values "our race will find an ever surer and surer stay." There seems to be a high reasonableness in such words as these from Shelley's Defence of Poetry: We have more moral, political, and historical wisdom than we know how to reduce into practice , we have more scientific and economical knowledge than we can accommodate to the just distribution of the produce which it multiplies. The poetry in these systems of thought, is concealed by the ac- cumulation of facts and calculating processes. There is no want of knowledge respecting what is wisest and best in morals, government and political econ- omy, or at least, what is wiser and better than what men now practise and endure. But we let I dare not wait upon / would, like the poor cat in the adage. We want the creative faculty to imagine that which we know 5 we want the generous impulse to act that which we imagine ; we want the poetry of life: our calculations have outrun our conception •&gt; we have eaten more than we can digest. The cultivation of those sciences which have enlarged the empire 404</page><page sequence="2">Shelley : Values and Imagination of man over the eternal world, has, for want of the poetical faculty, propor- tionally circumscribed those of the internal world , and man, having enslaved the elements, remains himself a slave. These words in themselves may seem to us a little strange as coming from "a beautiful and ineffectual angel beating in a void his luminous wings in vain." I need not say in passing that I believe Matthew Arnold's rather anomalous opinion of angels, arising out of what may have been a certain Victorian want of familiarity with such creatures, must long since have been corrected by the blasts of Gabriel sum- moning an effective escort to lead the great critic to his mansion near seas of faith forever at the full. And it may seem more than a little strange that one should associate with political and economic prob- lems those values which may be perceived through imagination. But it was Shelley's conviction that there is at last only one utility, that which in the highest sense assures men of abiding happiness. He was poet enough to know that man is overset by a great reality and a final need - the "on earth" reality and the "Thy will" need. He, more than most poets, opens to the American scholar the privilege of be- ing interested, graciously or sternly interested in the affairs of men. Here in America where the calculating faculty has outrun the po- etical faculty, and where because of this fact we face the deserts ahead with only the waters of Marah in our canteens, Shelley would declare the function of the imaginative man. As scholars we must turn from indulging in the mannerisms of those who potter over dusty inconsiderables and we must accept this higher function with dignity and with energy. I wish to submit, further, that it was out of direct familiarity with the conditions of his day that Shelley's philosophy grew. He was born on a farm in Sussex and grew up observing that it is a silly and an evil business to pay poor rates to farm laborers, thereby depriving them of an opportunity to earn an honest living. Near his Sussex home were camps of soldiers offering him evidence, as the ruined villages of France later did, of the tragic stupidity of war. While he was yet a boy he learned the ways of a university, sister to that institution which Professor Thomas Gray called by the name of Babylon, insisting with a delicious whimsicality that it was the place of which the prophet spoke when he said, "Their houses shall be full of doleful creatures, and owls shall build there, and satyrs shall dance there; their towers 405</page><page sequence="3">The American Scholar shall be a den forever, a joy of wild asses." Shelley lived in Edin- burgh and York, in the northwest and southwest counties. He en- tered English politics through the wild alleys of Dublin. He shared his substance with the poor people of Marlow who were being starved by the power looms. And he himself starved and suffered from the law in the London of "Lawyers- judges-old hobnobbers." Much, much more of Shelley's writing has come from a first-hand famili- arity with facts than has sometimes been supposed. A modern critic of this poet fails beyond censure if he leaves the impression that the values which Shelley sought were abstract, void-born intellectuali- sations unassociated with human realities, that by speaking of this poet's imagination he refers to some faery faculty which produces only delicate lyrics of the wind. Since Shelley has been so often misunderstood, and misunderstood by worthy men like Matthew Arnold who should have brothered him in wisdom, I wish to call attention to what I think is a very im- portant thing. That thing is this: the first six years of Shelley's literary life were mainly given to prose. His interests were not in- definite, and they were largely social and political. He thought of himself as taking a hand in English affairs. None of the poets of England, not even John Milton, has left us evidence of such clear understanding and sound sense, at the age of twenty, as did Shelley in his Irish documents. Maugre the Pauline attitude and phraseology of those documents and the fusion of French lemmata in them, we have now to observe that all of those things for which Shelley spoke, in so far as England and Ireland have become well adjusted, have been written into law. I may say that I believe the adjustment would have been still more happy had the English heeded the first of his principles, which was that moral righteousness and political trans- actions should not be separated; and had the Irish heeded the second, which was that all political rights gained and changes wrought can be insured only by the worthiness of the people to enjoy them. Among his other prose writings we must remember his Letter to Lord Ellen- borough, a trenchant appeal for judicial justice; his treatise upon the public crime of capital punishment, a document which today might be read with applause; his plea for the poor of England, written at the time of the death of Princess Charlotte; his Proposal for Putting Reform to a Vote, a work which has been called the most 406</page><page sequence="4">Shelley : Values and Imagination sane and sensible political writing of the era. We remember, also, his Refutation of Deisrn&gt; a Socratic attempt to argue away those por- tions of the Old Testament which now few of us care to retain; and his Essay on Christianity of which Stopf ord Brooke has said, "There is no more remarkable vindication of Jesus, and no more remarkable anticipation of the position Jesus will take in the future." Finally we remember his Philosophical View of Reform, the ultimate criti- cism of which lives in the invitation to read it; and the exquisite Defence of Poetry which not to read is an ultimate criticism of our- selves. Whether it be because they were his or not, the principles of Shelley are being driven through and through the consciousness of Europe. What an ingenious paradox it is that Matthew Arnold, hav- ing failed to see that Shelley's poetry and prose are of one piece, ßhould have felt that his "delightful Essays" would "come to stand higher than his poetry." I have already said what I regard as primary and fundamental if Shelley is to be understood, namely, that his poetry and his prose are largely of one piece and essentially of one purpose. That purpose you have heard Shelley himself say is to bring wisdom into our political, economic, and moral practice; to center man within himself and to make him master of the external world; to quicken all that we know by the creative power of imagination until we put the highest and the best truth into deeds and make it real. In short, the grand purpose of Shelley's work is, through the power of imagination, to determine and to release into human living those ultimate values without which "how poor a thing is man." This young man growing into a mastery of many languages and a familiarity with many literatures and philosophies moved forward in his maturity toward Athens and Jerusalem. The maturity of Shel- ley, like that of most men who escape the dizzy raptures and animal appetites of youth, began in agony. The workings of this maturing force in him we shall not attempt to trace. I merely wish to recall the fact that in his twenty-fourth year the body of the lovely Harriet Westbrook was found in the Serpentine river. Whether it be true or not that "the heart of an honest man is horrible" I cannot know, since the lanthorn I carry is a simple one such as Stevenson kept under his coat, not a savage machine fitted with the X-ray bulbs of Joubert. But of this I am sure, that the death of his first wife and the loss of 407</page><page sequence="5">The American Scholar his children affected Shelley deeply. It was then - and we should mark this - that in the main Shelley turned from prose to poetry. He did not change his purpose, he changed his medium. He did not shift his values, he sought them with surer genius. Within him the quicks of pain had been torn open 5 about him he saw the bitter misery of the poor; death he believed to be near, and wanting desperately to get something done, he turned to poetry. This was the natural re- sponse of his genius to a drastic situation. Make of it what we will, Shelley insisted that it is "poets - those who imagine" - who "are the institutors of laws and the founders of civil society," it is poets, imaginative men, who are "the unacknowledged legislators of the world." This is an enormous claim, and it brings us to the very front of our problem. In simple words we have now to consider values and imagination as Shelley conceived them; and, guided by his mind, we have to determine how values may be discerned by the imagination and secured by it. We are accepting his assumption that there are values, and that the mind does have the power to know and to cherish them - an "awful power" which rises "from the mind's abyss," a power which "Through sad incompetence of human speech" we call Imagination. Since nothing would have satisfied Shelley more than the quoting of Wordsworth to illume his meaning, I wish to con- tinue - T . 1 • i • , Imagination, T which, 1 i in truth, , Is but another name for absolute power And clearest insight, amplitude of mind, And Reason in her most exalted mood. In using the word in no other way than I conceive Shelley to have used it I am taking no issue with the Greek distrust of phantasie; and I especially would avoid that issue because I am convinced that that distrust lived in the mind of the most imaginative of the Greeks. That the greatest poet of Greece, and the man whom Shelley ad- mired more than any other except the greater poet of Galilee, warned us against a certain seething temper should be sufficient. Remember- ing that Chaucer assures us that Men may dye of imaginacioun I naturally do not in Shelley's name refer to that deadly intervolv- ing torquacity of mists which arises from the boiling brains of frenzy. 408</page><page sequence="6">Shelley : Values and Imagination I prefer rather to indulge in Shakespeare's mischievous laughter, the wise laughter of an initiate. I do not refer to the self-deceiving power which Pascal reduced mathematically to miserable integers of zero, or to that cowardly thing with cataracts on its eyes, bowing ever with its back toward truth, the thing which Spinoza had imagination enough to destroy. But I do refer, as I believe Shelley would have me do, to that absolute power, ample and exalted, which dwells most intimately within the mind of man. The grand assumption from which Shelley's idea of the imagination depends is that moving above us and among us there is an "overruling Spirit of all the energy and wisdom included within the circle of existing things." This Spirit is not the mere anthropomorphic projection of the mind of man, con- jured by fear, determined by need. It is the true ultimate and absolute. Between the mind of man and this Spirit, between the will of man and this Spirit there may exist the most exquisite consentaniety. Within the human being lives an imperial principle which may harmonize him with this Intellectual Beauty, continuing his life upward, above himself erecting himself. In turn this Spirit of Beauty being in need of our need consecrates all that it shines upon of human thought or form. In short, says Shelley, "This Power is God." Now a greater than Shelley said, "In Him we live and move and have our being," and the world was not offended. And again one whom Matthew Arnold thought greater than Shelley said, "In la sua voluntade e nostra face^ and the world was not offended. But Shelley, striving for a perfect suggestion of the vital one-ness of man exalted with the Infinite and the One, quoted a greater poet than either Paul or Dante, and said, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." If, by means of paraphrase, I might relate this beatitude to our study and in that relationship give it clear and inevitable meaning I would say, "Blessed are the imaginative, for they shall see God." For Shelley, then, there was an Infinite Spirit of Beauty and the mind was charged with a divine puissance by which it might com- mune with that Spirit. It is not to be wondered at that he looked upon that puissance with awe and acknowledged its workings with rapture, for thus did and ever shall the prophets. All of us employ such means as we can to assure ourselves of some value. We may give ourselves in noble sadness to animal faith. Knowing that we are poor pieces of agglutinated dust, we yet lift ourselves from the sure foundations of 409</page><page sequence="7">The American Scholar unyielding despair. If we be strong men we shall cry out all bloody of brow that we are still the masters of our fate. Others of us seek silence quickly. But for Shelley the power that redeemed "from decay the visitations of the Divinity in man/' the power that turned all things to loveliness, the power that made "immortal all that is best and most beautiful in the world, the living power and prime agent" by means of which he participated in the activity of the Infinite was imagination. As contradistinguished from mere Reason, not "Reason in her most exalted mood," Imagination is the imperial and creative power which imparts to its proper thought or deed something of that ever-pristine Genius which "creates anew the universe." Says Shelley: "Reason is the enumeration of quantities already known ; imagination is the per- ception of the value of those quantities. Reason is to the imagination as the instrument to the agenty as the body to the spirity as the shadow to the substance." And the expression of the imagination which per- ceives value is poetry. When Shelley says, then, that "Poets are those who imagine" he means that poets are those who perceive values with clearest insight ; and secondly when he says that "Poets are the institutors of laws, the founders of civil society, the teachers and the legislators of the world" he means that poets are those who make available to man the values which they perceive. Shelley would qualify Emerson. The Concord sage with great justice and cool sense states that "All institutions are but the lengthened shadows of a few imaginative men." The English poet would say, "All institutions of value are the spreading light of those who through imagination have drawn into propinquity with the Beautiful and the True." We may be sure, then, that Shelley is not indulging in a rhapsody of words when he speaks of the high nature of poetry and when he expects that it is the poet who will come close home to men's bosoms and their business with the values which they need. For, as Words- worth has said, the poet breathes out the breath and the finer spirit of all knowledge. "He is the rock of defence for human nature. He binds together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society." Refining and extending the thought of the man who in re- spect of poetry might justly be called his master, the younger genius goes on to say that "Poetry is indeed something divine. It is at once 410</page><page sequence="8">Shelley : Values and Imagination the center and the circumference of knowledge"; and, being that which comprehends all science, it "creates new materials of knowl- edge and power and pleasure" and arranges them "according to a cer- tain order which may be called the beautiful and the good. It is as it were the interpénétration of a diviner nature through our own" j or, to change the figure, "it arrests the vanishing apparitions which haunt the interlunations of life. Poetry is the record of the best and the hap- piest moments of the happiest and best minds." It expresses life in its eternal truth. It would now seem palpable and open that if poets are imaginative men, and that if "Poetry is the record of the best and happiest mo- ments of the happiest and best minds," the highest values we can know are those revealed in this supreme imaginative record. Surely it were a wayward seeker for values who would turn either to the unhappy moments of the best minds or to the happiest moments of the second best. And we are the more willing to accept the urgency of Shelley when we remember that among the ancients he puts first the minds of Plato and Jesus, and among the moderns the minds of Dante, Bacon, Shakespeare, and Milton. Again it were wayward indeed to try to better the choice. But in the philosophy of Shelley there is a service imagination may perform for men more immediate than in expressing itself through poetry. Imagination may release values into life directly. If I may offer a paraphrase of his thinking I can draw the matter into a para- graph. A man to be greatly good must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another; the pains and pleasures of his species must be his own. The great instrument of moral good is imagination, the presence or absence of which in its most perfect and universal form has been found to be connected with good and evil in conduct and habit. When imag- ination goes blind, men become calculating and selfish. They sell life for money, they sell love for money. They send nightmare armies down into the saffron marshes of death to glut some incubus king. It is not for want of admirable doctrines that men hate and despise and censure and deceive and subjugate one another. But imagination acts in another and a diviner manner. It awakens and enlarges the mind. It reveals to us that the great secret of morals is love or a going out of our own nature and an identification of our- selves which exists in some thought, action, or person not our own. It is indeed, for these reasons, past comprehension how much value and how much of the 411</page><page sequence="9">The American Scholar very life of being men have drawn from such poets as Plato and Jesus, and from that power which lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the mind and this goodly universe to which the mind is wedded. Indeed, as Quiller-Couch has said, Our true poets are prophets. And of all our prophets, amid our present discontents Shelley still exerts over the mass of Englishmen an incomparable power. He has much to teach us yet. If he can teach us the root of his matter - that human society will never be reformed but on some law of love and understanding - he will come in time to an even greater kingdom than he yet inherits. Shelley's is a far stiffer, more positive genius than Shakespere's. Shelley preached, as Shakespere did not. Nevertheless a preacher of genius, if he be sincere, in the right sense poetical - that is, creative - will find the world come round to him. This has happened again and again to Isaiah. It has happened to Shelley. Either there are values in life or there are not. Shelley assumed that there are. If there are, then there must be some faculty of the mind most suited to discern them. That faculty or power Shelley took to be imagination. The imagination, then, being imperial becomes the means through which man experiences the Infinite. In proportion as man becomes more imaginative he experiences more of the Infinite and becomes more God-like ; and in proportion as he becomes more God-like he becomes more creative; and as he becomes more creative he knows more certainly the values of life; and as he knows more cer- tainly the values of life, he would save that which is lost, and love all. Love, from its awful throne of patient power In the wise heart, from the last giddy hour Of dread endurance, from the slippery, steep And narrow verge of crag-like agony, springs And folds over the world its healing wings. To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite; To forgive wrongs darker than death or night; To defy Power, which seems omnipotent; To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates From its own wreck the thing it contemplates; Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent; This, like thy glory, Titan, is to be Good, great and joyous, beautiful and free; This is alone Life, Joy, Empire, and Victory. 412</page></plain_text>
