<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion: Otherness in History and in Text RobertJohn Shefler Manning / QuincyCollege In the autumn of 1915 at Princeton, the graduate student Charles Hendel and the professor Norman Kemp Smith went for a walk. Hendel thought the time auspicious to announce his desire to write a dissertation on Rousseau. As happens not infrequently between an adviser and a student, Kemp Smith attempted to dissuade his student from his intention and advised him to look into David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Reli- gion instead. The professor noted that a "deadlock" had long existed between those who thought the skeptic, Philo, spoke for Hume and those who thought the theistic views of Cleanthes most nearly echoed Hume's true opinions on religion. Perhaps through researching the problem, Kemp Smith suggested, Hendel could "resolve that impasse and establish Hume's position on the religious question."' Hendel took his mentor's advice and concluded that what Hume was really doing in The Dialogues was giving vent to the uncertainties in his own mind, so that not any one of the characters but only the narrator, Pamphilus, who expresses the views of all the characters, can be identified as Hume. As to how Hume actually did finally answer the religious ques- tion, Hendel modified the traditional "Cleanthes is Hume" argument by stating that we may take Pamphilus's endorsement of Cleanthes to mean that Hume himself agreed with the "anthropomorphic theism" expressed by that character.2 Not only did Hendel's clever solution fail to settle the issue, but it actu- ally stimulated further debate in that it provoked Kemp Smith's quite dif- ferent answer to the problem. In the introduction to his 1935 edition of The Dialogues, Kemp Smith insisted that the answers to the unresolved I Charles Hendel, Studies in the Philosophy ofDavid Hume (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1925), p. vii. 2 Ibid, p. 347. ? 1990 by The University of Chicago.

More than this, however, I shall analyze the history of reception of Hume's text to explore why nearly all interpreters of The Dia- logues have resisted the notion that Hume's own historical situation affected how he wrote his text. This will lead us to analyze our most com- mon presuppositions about how texts are written, how they are to be interpreted, and how they are related to history. It is my hope that this will enable us to perform what Gadamer called the truly critical task of hermeneutics, which is to distinguish "the true prejudices by which we understand, from the false ones by which we misunderstand."6 The his- tory of reception of The Dialogues can reveal to us, I believe, what our prej- udices regarding the relation between history and text enable us to see and what they prevent us from seeing. Hume's Dialogues are a three-way conversation among Demea, Clean- thes, and Philo narrated by Cleanthes' young student, Pamphilus. Demea represents Christian orthodoxy in that he maintains that, although God's existence is obvious to all, his essence and his attributes are so far supe- rior to those possessed by humans that we would never know of them were we not aided by revelation: "The essence of that mind, his attri- butes, the manner of his existence, the very nature of his duration; these and every particular, which regards so divine a Being, are mysterious to men" (p. 141). To Cleanthes this is mere mysticism, for his faith is not in revelation but in the power of human reason, which regards design in the universe and correctly concludes therefrom the existence and nature of the designer. Thus, the basis of his anthropomorphic theism is the argument for God's existence from the design in the universe: "The curious adapting of means 3 Norman Kemp Smith, ed., Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1935; 2d ed., New York and London: Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, 1947), p. 25.

Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble, and that the Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man.... By this argument a posteriori, and by this argument alone, do we prove at once the existence of a Deity and his similarity to human mind and intelli- gence" (p. 143). It is much more problematic to determine Philo's position. In the first eleven dialogues he voices skeptical views opposed to Cleanthes' argu- ment from design. However, at the beginning of the twelfth and last dia- logue he says he is actually in agreement with Cleanthes and gives his assent with great enthusiasm to the argument from design. By the end of the twelfth dialogue, however, he has changed again and concludes that we can deduce from the universe only the most dubious and nebulous the- ism, which only makes more pronounced our need, not for philosophical reasoning, but for revelation: "A person, seasoned with a just sense of the imperfections of natural reason, will fly to revealed truth with the greatest avidity" (p. 227). At this point in our discussion, suffice it to say that Philo either is, or pretends to be, a philosophical skeptic, and at least in the first eleven dialogues all the rhetorical cleverness he can muster is directed against Cleanthes' use of the argument from design: "Is the world, consid- ered in general and as it appears to us in this life, different from what a man or such a limited being would, beforehand, expect from a very pow- erful, wise, and benevolent Deity? It must be strange prejudice to assert the contrary. And from thence I conclude that, however consistent the world may be, allowing certain suppositions and conjectures, with the idea of such a Deity, it can never afford us an inference concerning his exis- tence" (p. 205). The battle lines seem to be fairly clearly drawn. Hume is either support- ing the positive and theistic arguments of Cleanthes or the much more neg- ative and skeptical arguments of Philo. Since The Dialogues are Hume's last word on religion, they have always been thought to provide the secret as to what Hume himself really believed, and this is why for the last two hundred years the question has been asked over and over again, but always with urgency: which views did Hume himself really hold, Cleanthes' positive and theistic beliefs or Philo's negative and skeptical ones?7 A first reading of The Dialogues all but forces us to agree with Hendel 7James Noxon, e.g., in his essay "Hume's Agnosticism" (in Hume, ed. V. C. Chappell [Notre Dame, Ind.: Notre Dame University Press, 1968], p. 363), writes that, unless the question of who speaks for Hume can be answered, "Hume's last philosophical testament provides us with no clue to his own religious convictions." 591</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion that Cleanthes expresses Hume's true views. There are four obvious rea- sons why it is immediately apparent that this must be. These four reasons are all textual, all clearly based on and supported by the text itself: (1) As The Dialogues are in the form of a letter from Pamphilus to his friend, Hermippus, they are a more elaborate account of what Pamphilus has already discussed with his friend. Since Hermippus has already been exposed to the conversation, he has already judged the arguments, and Pamphilus presents to us Hermippus'sjudgment-Demea's views amount to "rigid inflexible orthodoxy," while Philo's skepticism is judged to be "careless," but Cleanthes' views are said to illustrate his "accurate philo- sophical turn" (p. 128). Thus, at the very beginning of The Dialogues, we are presented with Hermippus's judgment that affirms Cleanthes' views over those of Philo. (2) Philo's arguments seem to contend not only with the belief in God's nature and attributes but also with the belief in God's existence, even though Hume himself in The Natural History of Religion and the narrator and both Philo and Demea in The Dialogues have already stated that the existence of God is self-evident and beyond dispute. Since much of Philo's polemic is directed toward questioning what even he has agreed is beyond question, it appears as though Philo is only pretending to be opposed to Cleanthes' position. (3) After his arguments grow to such a pitch of impiety that they send Demea out of the room, Philo admits that he was really just jesting, and he confesses his belief in the argument from design. Even though you know I love to argue, Philo says to his friend Cleanthes, you also know that "no one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind, or pays more profound adoration to the divine Being, as he discovers himself to reason, in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature" (p. 214).8 (4) At the very end of The Dialogues, Pamphilus confirms Hermippus's view that Cleanthes' arguments are to be most highly esteemed: "I cannot but think, that Philo's principles are more probable than Demea's; but that those of Cleanthes approach still nearer to the truth" (p. 228). In arguments for identifying Cleanthes' views as Hume's own, one or more of these reasons is certain to appear. B. M. Laing, for instance, con- cludes on the basis of reasons 2 and 4 that there is no difficulty in deciding that Cleanthes is Hume-Hume in an earlier work, The Natural History of Religion, and in The Dialogues says that the existence of God cannot be questioned, and at the conclusion of The Dialogues Pamphilus endorses Cleanthes' views.9 Although Gabriel Campayre admits that at times Philo 8 T. E. Jessop rightly points out in his essay, "The Present-Day Relevance of Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion" (Aristotelian Supplement 18 [1939]: 1-46), that Philo's conversion in the last dialogue is the primary problem in explaining the work as a whole. 9 B. M. Laing, David Hume (London: Ernest Benn, 1932), pp. 174-82. 592</page><page sequence="5">Hume's Dialogues sounds like Hume, he too invokes the fourth reason. "The last words of the book," says he, "do not permit any doubt" that Cleanthes is actually Hume.'0 Similarly, Bruce McEwen refers to Pamphilus's endorsement of Cleanthes as Hume's "last utterance in speculation" concerning religion." The conclusion of Charles Hendel and, following Hendel, Rudolf Metz and most recently Jeffrey Wieand, that it is Cleanthes who primarily speaks for Hume, depends to a very great extent on Pamphilus's endorse- ment of Cleanthes at the end of The Dialogues. It is, in fact, Jeffrey Wieand who presents most clearly the hermeneu- tical presuppositions on which the "Cleanthes is Hume" interpretation must depend. In his article entitled "Pamphilus in Hume's Dialogues," Wieand discusses the deadlock over the question of which character expresses the views of Hume, and he presents two hermeneutical options employed to resolve the deadlock. We may be able to solve the problem by consulting Hume's other writings on religion, or Hume's letters, or the works Hume might have consulted in constructing The Dialogues. Thus, the key to the correct interpretation of The Dialogues may lie in the intertextual relation between The Dialogues and other texts. This hermeneutical option is employed quite often by the "Cleanthes is Hume" proponents. In fact, they nearly always appeal both to Hume's Natural History of Religion, in which he states that no reasonable person can doubt "the primary principles of genuine religion," and to a letter Hume wrote in 1751 to his very good friend Gilbert Elliot, declaring, "You wou'd per- ceive by the sample I have given you, that I make Cleanthes the hero of the dialogue."''2 The second hermeneutical option Wieand outlines entails that the real clue to understanding The Dialogues is entirely within the text itself. Wieand recommends this hermeneutical option when he dismisses other texts by saying that, if we "return to the text," it will become appar- ent that "the text supports the view advocated by Charles Hendel."'3 Wieand then argues for Hendel's reading by employing some of the four obvious textual reasons we have already advanced. Whatever else might be said about The Dialogues, it must be said that Wieand's statement is absolutely correct: the text does support the view that Cleanthes' views are superior to Philo's in that they are "nearer to the truth." This is, after all, exactly what the text says. It also says that Cleanthes exhibits an "accurate philosophical turn" and that Philo retracts all his arguments against his good and learned friend, Cleanthes. This is '0 Gabriel Campayre, La Philosophie de David Hume (Paris: Ernest Thorin, 1873), p. 324. 1 Quoted in Kemp Smith, p. 59. 12 David Hume, The Natural History of Religion, ed. H. E.

However, the problem with this straight or purely textual interpreta- tion of The Dialogues is that there are many other aspects within the text that throw into serious question the legitimacy of a purely textual inter- pretation. If Cleanthes' views are really to be preferred, then why are The Dialogues given over so predominantly to the voice, not of Cleanthes, but of Philo? Is it not true, as Kemp Smith has labored to show,14 that Philo consistently counters Cleanthes arguments, whereas Cleanthes' responses to Philo often amount to repeating what he has already stated? And if the last dialogue is decisive for demonstrating that Cleanthes' views are Hume's own, then why is Philo so dominant here to the extent that in the last dialogue Hume gives Pamphilus 8 lines, Cleanthes 66, and Philo 458? And if Philo really does recant in dialogue 12 all of his arguments made in the preceding eleven dialogues, thereby giving Cleanthes the victory and admitting that Cleanthes has been right all along, then why does he express in his concluding statement a very obscure and minimalist theism with which Cleanthes would certainly not agree? If the whole of natural theology, as some people seem to maintain, resolves itself into one simple, though somewhat ambiguous, at least undefined proposi- tion, that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence: If this proposition be not capable of extension, variation, or more particular explication: If it afford no inference that affects human life, or can be the source of any action or forbearance: And if the analogy, imperfect as it is, can be carried no farther than to the human intelligence; and cannot be transferred, with any appearance of probability, to the other qualities of the mind: If this really be the case, what can the most inquisitive, contempla- tive, and religious man do more than give a plain, philosophical assent to the proposition as often as it occurs; and believe that the arguments on which it is established, exceed the objections which lie against it? [P. 227] Certainly we can agree with Hendel, Wieand, and the "Cleanthes is Hume" proponents that the text itself does support the notion that Hume is recommending Cleanthes' use of the argument from design. In fact, from Hermippus's judgment with which the text commences, to Pamphilus's verdict, which serves as its conclusion, The Dialogues have cre- ated the expectation that Cleanthes' views are triumphant. The problem is, however, that expectations The Dialogues create they also frustrate; the text leads us to expect that Cleanthes will have the better of the argument, 14 Kemp Smith (n. 3 above), pp. 69-76. 594</page><page sequence="7">Hume's Dialogues but that is precisely what does not occur. That is why in reading The Dia- logues we have the feeling that something strange is going on here, that we are being played with. We have that unusual experience of having the text build up expectations only to confound them, which Gadamer so aptly describes as the experience of "being brought up short by the text."'5 Since Philo's cavils often go unanswered by Cleanthes, we are led to ask whether Philo is really sincere when he says he is only jesting in arguing against Cleanthes. Might this be one place where Hume is being ironic? And how can we take Pamphilus's endorsement of Cleanthes seriously as a reflection of Hume's true views, and can Cleanthes truly be the hero of The Dialogues since it is Philo who dominates the discussion and always gets the better of the argument? AsJohn Nelson puts it, "how can the loser in every match be in truth the hero of a tournament?"'6 Might this not be another instance of Hume's irony? Even Wieand recognizes this is a possi- bility when he admits that "clearly, there is some irony in The Dialogues. The question is where and how much.""7 The moment Wieand admits that there is some irony in The Dialogues, he immerses himself in a dilemma from which the hermeneutical strategy he recommends is by no means equipped to extricate him. How can we both take seriously the possibility of irony in the text and also return with Wieand to the text and put our trust in the interpretation that the text supports? If we concede to Wieand that the key to the correct interpreta- tion of The Dialogues is within the text, then what else can we do but listen to the text closely and hope that it is being straight with us? If our reading of The Dialogues is purely textual, then on what grounds can we evaluate just where and exactly how much irony is in The Dialogues? A straight or purely textual reading must proceed from the confidence that, even though the text may be ironic, it is not so ironic that it is untrustworthy. A straight reading proceeds from the confidence that the true meaning of the text is still discernible within the text itself. But it is precisely this confidence that our feeling of being played with, of being brought up short by the text, robs from us. Without this confidence, we cannot be nearly so sanguine as is Wieand about returning to the text, doing a purely textual reading, and trusting the results of that reading. After all, how much confidence can we have in a straight reading of what we sus- pect is a crooked text? The other possible way of interpreting The Dialogues that Wieand points out, that is, by consulting Hume's other works on religion and his '5 Gadamer, p. 237. '6 John Nelson, "The Role of Part XII in Hume's Dialogues," Hume Studies, 14, no. 2 (Novem- ber 1988): 361. 17 Wieand (n. 5 above), p. 37, n. 8. 595</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion letters, appears to be a much more reliable way to evaluate the irony in the text than is a purely textual interpretation. Perhaps we may be more secure in trusting that Hume really is recommending the theistic views of Cleanthes since he endorses the argument from design in The Natural History of Religion. The problem with this, however, is that we cannot be sure that Hume is not being ironic when he says this in The Natural His- tory of Religion. We cannot solve the problem of how ironic The Dialogues are by resorting to The Natural History of Religion until we have solved the problem of how ironic The Natural History of Religion is. The move to other Hume texts may seem like it puts us on more solid footing, and many are the critics who have made this move,'8 but in reality it only puts us on ever thinner ice. Neither of Wieand's two possible hermeneutical options-the textual and the intertextual-offer much help in solving the problems of just where The Dialogues are ironic and just how much irony they include. A more fruitful and helpful way to approach the question of irony in The Dialogues is to ask not where and how much, but why. Why might Hume in The Dialogues be ironic when he has the characters say certain things? Might Hume have had any reason for being ironic when composing The Dialogues so that they appear to be supporting Cleanthes and making him the hero while actually giving Philo the better of the argument? This is to ask, Is it possible that we can find in Hume's own particular place and time a reasonable explanation for why he employed irony in The Dialogues, and can we thereby gain some clue as to where and how much? The question of why The Dialogues are ironic leads to a third hermeneutical option, a third way to interpret the text and to come to some reasonable conclusion about who speaks for Hume. Perhaps the key to interpreting The Dialogues is not in the text itself, or in its relation to other texts, but is in its own unique historical context. This third hermeneutical option, the contextual or historical approach, is not even mentioned by Wieand. This oversight is in keeping with the work of Hendel and of the other "Cleanthes is Hume" proponents, for whom his- torical considerations have no place in the interpretation of The Dialogues. In fact, those who think that it is Cleanthes who speaks for Hume never, or almost never, mention the specific historical situation in which Hume wrote, and in interpreting The Dialogues straightforwardly they treat them as if they were just like any other text. 18James Noxon states in his Hume's Philosophical Development (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973), p. 175, that "the reservations which many commentators on The Dialogues have felt about identifying Philo's position as Hume's are mainly owing to the difficulty of reconciling the sceptic's damaging analysis of the design argument with Hume's own endorsement of it elsewhere." 596</page><page sequence="9">Hume's Dialogues If we look into the historical situation in which The Dialogues were writ- ten, however, it is evident that they are not at all exactly like any other text. The fact that they are a posthumously published work, even though Hume completed them fifteen years before his death, is indicative of the many ways in which The Dialogues are different and unusual. A text sub- stantially completed by 1761 at the latest but withheld from publication until 1779, three years after Hume's death, because it wasjudged too sub- versive to appear during the author's lifetime, is decidedly not like every other text. A fact always to keep in mind when interpreting The Dialogues is that, even though there is no agreement about which character speaks for Hume, still they were considered so threatening to the society in which they were written that Hume never dared to publish them in his lifetime. The facts surrounding the composition and the long-delayed publica- tion of The Dialogues are well known, thanks largely to Kemp Smith, but are rarely mentioned by those who argue that Cleanthes expresses Hume's true views on religion. Hume completed a shorter version of The Dialogues by 1751 and circulated it among his friends, every one of whom, so far as we know, urged him to suppress it for fear of the abuse and per- haps even criminal prosecution it might bring on its author. Dr. Hugh Blair, for instance, wrote from Paris in 1763 that, if Hume in his writings had gone "one step farther" and openly declared his lack of religious beliefs, the atheistic French philosophes would have erected a statue in his honor. Blair then shrewdly cautions: "If you showed them the MSS of cer- tain Dialogues perhaps that honour may still be done you. But for God's sake let that be a posthumous work, if ever it shall see the light: Tho' I really think it had better not."19 That same year Hume complained in a letter to Sir Gilbert Elliot: "Is it not hard and tyrannical in you, more hard and tyrannical than any act of the Stuarts, not to allow me to publish my Dialogues? Pray, do you not think a proper dedication may atone for what is exceptionable in them?"20 Hume heeded his friends' advice and refrained from publishing The Dialogues. He did not desire to offend those members of the moderate clergy whom he considered friends, and he did not want to increase the controversy his earlier writings on religion had already caused. "Scotland is too narrow a place for me," he wrote to Adam Smith in 1759, "and it mortifies me that I sometimes hurt my friends."21 He hints at the contro- versy his writings have caused in a letter to his publisher in 1762: "I am 19 Raymond Klibansky and Ernest C. Mossner, eds., New Letters ofDavid Hume (New York: Gar- land, 1983), 1:72-73, n. 4. 20 Burton, 1:146-47. 21 Quoted in E. C. Mossner, The Life of David Hume (New York: Nelson, 1934), p. 354. 597</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion beginning to love peace very much, and resolve to be more cautious than formerly in creating myself enemies."22 To ensure that The Dialogues would eventually be published appears to have been one of Hume's primary concerns during the last few years of his life. In 1776, when Hume knew his life to be nearing its end, he stipulated in his will that to Adam Smith "I leave all my manuscripts without excep- tion, desiring to publish my Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion."'23 Smith still maintained that The Dialogues should not be published, so Hume determined to publish them himself. By this time, however, the illness that claimed his life was too far advanced, and he knew he would never live to see his Dialogues come to light. Anxious to make certain that The Dialogues would not be suppressed after his death, Hume altered his will and left the manuscript to his publisher. Hume had the foresight to stipulate that, if The Dialogues were not published within two and a half years of his death, they would become the property of his nephew, "whose Duty in publishing them as the last Request of his Uncle, must be approved by all the World."24 If Hume had not made this last stipulation just before he died, we might never have had The Dialogues in our litera- ture, for as Hume suspected, none of Hume's friends nor his publisher would sponsor their publication, and they went unpublished until they became the possession of Hume's nephew in 1779. We may better understand the reluctance of Hume's friends to become associated with The Dialogues if we remember the experiences of Adam Smith. His antipathy toward The Dialogues was such that after Hume died he confessed that, if the manuscript had been left to him, "it never should have been published in my lifetime." Perhaps to relieve some guilt about this, Smith published the well-known "Letter to William Strahan," where he describes the admirable qualities of his very good friend, David Hume. What is not so well known, however, is the great regret the author of The Wealth of Nations expressed for having done so: "A single, and as I thought, a very harmless Sheet of Paper, which I happened to write con- cerning the death of our late friend, Mr. Hume, brought upon me ten times more abuse than the very violent attack I had made upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain."25 Bearing in mind the controversy Hume caused in his own place and time by his writings on religion, and the fact that Hume twice applied for professorships and twice was denied because of his unorthodox religious views, and the fact that, while Hume was circulating the manuscript 22 Burton (n. 12 above), 1:130. 23 Quoted in Kemp Smith, p. 88. 24 Ibid., p. 90. 25 Mossner, p. 605. 598</page><page sequence="11">Hume's Dialogues among his friends in the 1750s, the General Assembly was debating whether or not to censor his writings,26 and the fact that while Hume was writing The Dialogues his friends among the moderate clergy were being attacked for defending him,27 and if we note the quite unusual circum- stances surrounding the publication of The Dialogues, we deem it quite plausible that Hume may not only have wanted The Dialogues to look like Cleanthes' views are triumphant, but that he even may have had to do this. Kemp Smith has pointed out that attacks on belief in God and on Christianity were not permitted by eighteenth-century British society.28 Thus, when historical considerations are taken into account, it seems fairly certain that Philo's views must be defeated and that Cleanthes' views must be judged "nearer to the truth" if The Dialogues are to remain dans le vrai, as Foucault has it, within the boundaries of what a society permits to be said and written.29 It may not, in fact, be too much to say that The Dia- logues are in dialogue form, not because Hume liked the genre, but because he had to use it. The dialogue form afforded him the best chance at being permitted to say ironically what he wanted to say. And The Dia- logues are ironic, not because of some inveterate but accidental trait of Hume's character,30 but because they had to be. Since Hume could not have said straightforwardly what he said ironically in The Dialogues, it seems likely that he did not choose the irony as much as he had it forced on him. Historical considerations suggest that the irony in The Dialogues exists not for the literary reason of preserving the dramatic interest, but for the practical and ultimately political reason that The Dialogues had to be presented ironically if Hume were to have any chance of publishing them without bringing on himself more calumny and perhaps even crimi- nal prosecution. As we have already said, the historical data concerning both Hume's life and The Dialogues are well known. The fact is, however, that critics have exhibited a curious reluctance and, at times, hostility toward believing that Hume's historical situation might have influenced the manner in 26 See Anand Chitnis, The Scottish Enlightenment: A Social History (London: Croom Helm, 1976), p. 57. When the General Assembly of 1755 did not censor him by name, Hume wrote to Allan Ramsay: "My damnation is postponed for a twelvemonth. But next Assembly will surely be upon me" (quoted in Richard Cher, Church and University in the Scottish Enlightenment [Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1985], p. 66). 27 According to Cher, p. 67, "The primary targets of the infidelity campaign of 1755-1756 were not Hume and Kames but their best friends among the Presbyterian clergy-the Moderate literati of Edinburgh." 28 Kemp Smith (n. 3 above), p. 39. 29 Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge (New York: Pantheon, 1972), p. 224. 3o See John Price, The Ironic Hume (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1956). In an otherwise excellent work, Price explains the irony in The Dialogues primarily as a literary device and as an aspect of Hume's character, at the expense of seeing how the irony was forced on Hume by the societal constraints under which he wrote. 599</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion which he composed The Dialogues. James Noxon, for instance, contends that Hume did not craft The Dialogues to conform with social conventions because he had not done it in any other work."' This is a curious remark in light of some interesting historical facts: Hume omitted his essay "Of Mir- acles" from A Treatise of Human Nature for fear it would offend the reli- gious; he agreed to suppress his essays "On Suicide" and "On the Immortality of the Soul," which were not published until 1783; he sup- pressed his 1757 open letter to John Home praising Home's controversial play Douglas because he decided that the group of moderate literati of which Home was a member would be more hurt than helped if he publicly associated himself with them;32 and when he criticized the argument from design in "Of A Particular Providence and A Future State," he used the oldest and most obvious trick in the book, "I was lately engaged in conver- sation with a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes ..."33 Noxon also won- ders why Hume would "pay so much deference to social convention in a work planned for posthumous publication"34 even though there is no evi- dence that Hume wrote The Dialogues intending to publish them posthumously. Quite to the contrary, he queried his friends for a number of years as to whether it would be wise to publish them and seems to have always retained some hope despite the controversy that they would evoke that someday he himself would be able to publish them. In fact, three months before his death, he wrote to Adam Smith, "If I live a few Years longer, I shall Publish them myself."35 John Nelson writes that, if Hume "ever was in fact concerned to placate his religious opponents, he had long since ceased to be" by the time he began writing The Dialogues. 36 As we have seen, there is a great deal of evi- dence that Hume was concerned about his writings creating enemies for himself. There is no evidence, however, to support Nelson's claim that Hume's concern for this ceased. In fact, the letters suggest that Hume actually became more concerned about not making enemies and not injuring his friends as he tired of controversy in the last two decades of his life.37 Also, since Nelson contends that Hume was not at all concerned to 31See Noxon, "Hume's Agnosticism" (n. 7 above), p. 375. 32 Cher, p. 80. 33 David Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (LaSalle, Ill.: Open Court, 1958), p. 146. 34 See Noxon, "Hume's Agnosticism," p. 375. 35J.

Hume's growing concern for the controversy his writings embroiled him in is also seen in his 1755 letter to Dr.John Cleophance, in which he declares that the treatment of religion in the first volume of his History of Great Britain "should have received more softenings" (quoted in Cher, p. 66). 600</page><page sequence="13">Hume's Dialogues placate his religious opponents, the onus is on him to explain then why Hume opted not to publish The Dialogues when he finished them in 1761. Nelson Pike provides another very interesting reason for not believing that Hume would craft The Dialogues to make them more acceptable to society. He says that this would amount to "intellectual subterfuge" and that it is "a big step to accuse any author" of this.38 If Hume's historical sit- uation were such that the only way he could publish what he wished to publish was to make Cleanthes, rather than Philo, look like the hero of The Dialogues, it is hard to understand how this necessary action can be taken as "intellectual subterfuge." If Hume did in fact make Cleanthes his hero not because he really believed in that character's views but because he had to to get The Dialogues published-which is at least possible considering that even so he still never published them-this provides us with no grounds for accusing Hume of anything. If anything, it bestows on us not the right to accuse, but the responsibility in our interpreting to penetrate beyond the mere textual meaning to the historical exigencies that bur- dened the author when he wrote. It bestows on us the responsibility to take seriously the historical context of the text and to respond to the text out of, as Gadamer has it, "the ethic of the historical consciousness, the conscientiousness of the historical mind."39 Even those critics who believe that Hume did compose The Dialogues to look like they support Cleanthes even though Philo actually voices Hume's true views have shown an inability to take seriously the exigencies of Hume's historical situation. James Orr, for instance, writes that Hume often included in his writings certain pious passages that certainly did not reflect his own beliefs. He did this, Orr thinks, not because he had to to get his work published, but because he had a penchant for mocking Chris- tianity, which Orr calls "reprehensible."40 Greig says Hume made The Dia- logues look less subversive because "he was desperately anxious to get the book published." According to Greig, this amounted to "weakness" on Hume's part.41 Even John Price, who notes that, when one is criticizing a society's most cherished beliefs, "irony is frequently the best method of keeping one's skin," still says quite naively: "Hume could have easily con- structed an ending in which Philo's superiority was announced." Hume made Cleanthes the hero of The Dialogues, Pricejudges, not out of a desire to keep his skin but, rather, to exhibit "admirable artistic economy.'"42 38 See Nelson Pike's commentary in his edition of The Dialogues (New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1970), p. 223. 39 Hans-Georg Gadamer, Philosophical Hermeneutics (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977), p. 204. 4oJames Orr, David Hume (New York: Scribner's, 1903), p. 207. 41 Greig, ed., pp. 237-38. 42 Price (n. 30 above), pp. 131 ff. 601</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion The question we are pressed to ask is, Why have the critics found it so difficult to believe that Hume's historical situation affected how he com- posed The Dialogues? Why have they been reluctant to believe that Hume made Cleanthes the hero because this was the only way he could even try to get his work published, and why have they preferred to believe instead either that Hume did this because he was malicious, or weak, or because he really did believe that Cleanthes' views are "nearer to the truth?" In other words, why is there in the history of reception of Hume's text such an obvious resistance to believe that historical forces actually impinged on and affected the writing of the text? Perhaps we can find a clue to this in Roland Barthes's critique of tradi- tional literary history in his On Racine.43 Here, Barthes attacks traditional historicism not only for being "author centered" but also for viewing the author as a great man who rises above the limitations of his own historical situation to produce the timeless text.44 The great writer, the author of the classic, is not one who is immersed in his own time, but one who tran- scends his own time. The belief that great writers transcend time rather than make concessions to it and are affected by it perhaps explains why some critics have thought that to say that in some way Hume had to com- pose The Dialogues so as to conform to the accepted conventions of his own place and time is really to attack him or to accuse him of something. Another plausible reason why critics have resisted the notion that his- torical forces impinged on and affected the writing of Hume's text has to do with the way in which we as twentieth-century readers most often understand the meaning of a text. The meaning of a text, we most often contend, is accessible to us precisely because it is not locked up back in the past, in the relation between author and his or her historical situation, but is present in the words of the text. The past of the author is irretrievably past, gone, dead. But the text is never past, is always present in that it is always quickened with the life of language. The life of language gives the text its meaning. This is, of course, the view of texts that was certainly not originated by, but canonized by the New Critics. For them, the text is an autonomous artifact with a life of its own, cut off from the historical situation out of which it comes.45 Although the heyday of New Criticism is now long past, 43 Roland Barthes, On Racine, trans. Richard Howard (New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 1964). 44 Frank Lentricchia, in commenting on On Racine in his After the New Criticism (Chicago: Uni- versity of Chicago Press, 1980), p. 135, notes that "even the most casual perusal of the tables of contents of books that are presented as literary histories will confirm his [Barthes's] point that traditional historicism, in its granting of privilege to the author, is largely driven by the idealist notion that the so-called major writer is one who transcends his times." 45 See Lentricchia's treatment of New Criticism in his After the New Criticism. Also, Terry Eagleton in his Literary Theory (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983), p. 48, states 602</page><page sequence="15">Hume's Dialogues the various literary theories that have since arisen to take its place have accepted much more than they have challenged the notion that the mean- ing of a text is to be found, not in the relation between text and author, but in the text itself. For example, the meaning of a text for Derrida and the Yale deconstructionists is within the play of the signifiers, a fact that has led Frank Lentricchia to label the deconstructionists "the newest gene- ration of New Critics"46 and has led Terry Eagleton to suggest that in a sense "Anglo-American deconstruction is no more than the return of the old New Critical formalism."47 Similarly, even a discourse analyst such as Paul Ricoeur declares his agreement with the view of a text as "a kind of atemporal object, which has, so to speak, cut its ties from all historical development."48 Understanding the meaning of a text, writes Ricoeur, "has less than ever to do with the author and his situation."49 Perhaps not surprisingly, it is the harshest critic of contemporary liter- ary theory's New Critical inheritance who reminds us of what our ten- dency to view authors as somehow transcendent to history and texts as cut off from history causes us to forget. In his The World, the Text, and the Critic, Edward Said declares: "nearly everyone producing literary or cul- tural studies makes no allowance for the truth that all intellectual work occurs somewhere, at some time, on some previously mapped-out and permissible terrain, which is ultimately contained by the state."50 It is pre- cisely this truth that The Dialogues force us to confront. Wieand's call for a return to the text reveals the inadequacy of a purely textual interpretation and the need for a hermeneutical strategy that considers the text's histori- cal context. The Dialogues force on the reader, not a return to the text, as Wieand and so many others recommend, but a return to context, a return to history, to that "previously mapped-out and permissible terrain, which is ultimately contained by the state." Frank Lentricchia argues that an antihistorical view of texts is actually tied to an idealistic conception of history that sees history, not as the scene of disruption and change, but of continuity and sameness.5' One ramifica- that for the New Critics "rescuing the text from author and reader went hand in hand with disen- tangling it from any social or historical context. ... The poem must be plucked free of the wreck- age of history and hoisted into a sublime space above it." 46 Frank Lentricchia, Criticism and Social Change (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 39. 47Eagleton, p. 146. 48 Paul Ricoeur, Interpretation Theory: Discourse and the Surplus of Meaning (Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press, 1976), p. 91. 49 Paul Ricoeur, "The Model of the Text: Meaningful Action Considered as a Text," Social Research 38, no. 3 (Fall 1971): 557-58. 50 Edward Said, The World, the Text, and the Critic (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1983), p. 169. 51 See Lentricchia's After the New Criticism, pp. 109 ff. 603</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion tion of conceiving of history as the repetition of the same is that the texts coming to us from the past are regarded as equally free, equally permit- ted. History as the repetition of the same means that all times and all places grant all authors the freedom to write what they wish and to inscribe their meaning within the words of the text, there to be discerned by the reader. What is forgotten when history is viewed as the repetition of the same is difference, otherness within both history and text. The inadequacy of an ahistorical, purely textual interpretation of The Dialogues enables us to recover otherness in history and in text. The Dia- logues are not at all just like any other text, and their difference results from their rootedness in another time and another place very different from our own. A place and a time in which Hume was not permitted to write whatever he wished about religion, in which he had to use the dia- logue form and irony to make the character who expresses views accepta- ble to society at the time appear to be the hero of the work to even have a chance of getting it published, is genuinely other than our own, perhaps more so than we most often realize. The Dialogues are different because they are a product of this otherness in history. The otherness of the text results from and, if our reading will allow it, testifies to the otherness of the past, the otherness within history. If The Dialogues return us to history, by doing so they also bestow on us the responsibility and the obligation to try to decipher as best we can the difference between the historical context in which Hume wrote and the one in which we read and interpret. If we are correct in thinking that his- torical considerations are decisive in determining which character speaks for Hume, then we have the responsibility and the obligation to be consci- entious in our historical research. This responsibility and this obligation mean that there is an aspect of our interpreting which could rightly be called ethical. Gadamer points us toward this when he writes of "the ethic of the historical consciousness, the conscientiousness of the historical mind."52 Wayne Booth, in his recent book on ethical criticism, entitled The Com- pany We Keep, asks if the reader is obligated in any way to the author, owes the author "any special kind of reading conduct."53 To really answer this question, Booth readily admits, "would require a different kind of book, one that would come back with the good news that obligations to others, dead or alive, have rational force."54 Doubtless, no contemporary philosopher has insisted more strongly on 52 Gadamer, Philosophical Hermeneutics (n. 37 above), p. 204. 5 Wayne Booth, The Company We Keep (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1988), p. 165. 54 Ibid. 604</page><page sequence="17">Hume's Dialogues our obligations to others than Emmanuel Levinas. He, too, has been con- cerned with the ethical aspect of interpretation. For Levinas, the primary task of interpretation is, not to echo the meaning of the text, but to link the text to the real history of the person who created it.55 Only by doing this, says Levinas, can we hope to discover that in the process of interpre- tation, not only is there within the words of the text a meaning to be dis- cerned, but there is also an obligation to and responsibility for another person, for the person who, across the miles and the years, first gave life to the text. Hume's Dialogues are particularly illuminative of this obligation and this responsibility. By revealing the inadequacy of a purely textual inter- pretation, they return us to the text's context in place and time, to history. They also reveal and return us to the ethical aspect of interpretation, to what Gadamer calls the "ethic of the historical consciousness," which springs, as Levinas always reminds us, from our ethical obligation to and responsibility for the other person. For it is ultimately this obligation and this responsibility that drives us beyond what the text merely says in order to come to the most plausible interpretation as to what Hume himself really thought regarding the religious question, so as to fulfill our obliga- tion to him and to render a just interpretation of his (and our) text. 55See Emmanuel Levinas's 1948 essay, "Reality and Its Shadow" in his Collected Philosophical Papers, trans.
