<plain_text><page sequence="1">changed the Greco-Roman idea of happiness by defining it in, and confining it to, a Christian context: Deum qui habet beatus est (De Beata Vita 2. 11). Furthermore, man can only 'have' God by grace, through the mediation of Christ. If man, in his fallen condition, still has some sense of and desire for true happiness, it is because of God's initiative (De Trin. 4. 1. 2: ac per hoc egit nobiscum) and not because of any natural divinity in human nature. Furthermore Augustine, in contrast to much ancient thought, insists that true happiness is unobtainable in this life; we are happy in this world only in spe, not in re; and Augustine's definition of happiness in his letter to Proba: Ille igitur beatus est, qui omnia quae vult habet, nec aliquid vult quod non decet (Ep. 130. 5. 11) must be understood in an eschatological sense: Tunc erit vera vita post mortem, verumque solatium post desolationem (ibid., 2. 5). B. lists his conclusion about Augustine's view of happiness under five headings (pp. 23-43): (1) Augustine's idea of the happy life is characterised by its unlikeness to the life of the present world; (2) it consists in having God; (3) it pertains to the future, in the visio beatifica; (4) the manner of 'having' God is by loving: Beata quippe vita si non amatur, non habetur (Civ. Dei 14. 25); (5) the happy life is one of the highest spiritual and emotional intensity, but the emotion is always the result of the action of the Holy Spirit. Thus there can be no reduction of happiness to the level of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World: 'They get what they want, and they never want what they can't get'. Here, the author might have made more of the Augustinian notion of participation in God (briefly noticed on p. 35 in connexion with Trin. 4. 2.4: Illuminatio quippe nostra participatio Verbi est, illius scilicet vitae quae lux est hominum) and his doctrine of Deification (see Victorino Capanaga in Augustinus Magister II [1954], 745-54). This is an interesting essay. The style is, however, not an easy one for the foreign reader and English-speaking scholars may find it helpful to consult the translation in the Augustine Lecture.

London: The Warburg Institute, 1983 (1982 on title page). Paper, ?18. The Secret of Secrets, a Fiirstenspiegel enriched with occult speculation, is genetically connected with the ever productive genre of letters between Aristotle and Alexander. Hence its attribution to Aristotle. In itself it is of none but antiquarian interest. But its immense popularity in the Middle Ages and beyond claims the attention of the historian of literature and culture. The present tightly-packed and well-produced collection of articles on the Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, French, and Russian versions caters for most needs. Some Arabic version is first attested in 941. The work purports to have been translated into Arabic from classical Greek via Byzantine Greek or Syriac. But there is no need to believe in the existence of a Greek or Syriac original. The Arabic evidence is complex and confused. No major breakthrough has been made since Manzalaoui's comprehensive account in Oriens 23-24 (1974), 146-257. Oxford F. W. ZIMMERMANN A. WARDMAN: Religion and Statecraft among the Romans. Pp. vi + 217. London: Granada, 1982. ?12.50. The history of Roman religion used to be straightforward. Primitive Rome was marked by simple piety towards the gods of nature, an idyllic state of innocence which was shattered first by the importation of Hellenic, anthropomorphic deities with their alien mythology and then by the increasing interference of politics in the sphere of religion. By the late Republic religion counted for little; manipulation and scepticism were rife. The restoration by Augustus may have stemmed this melancholy decline temporarily, but state cults had little power under the empire. True religion lay in the personal cults of oriental origin and in Christianity. In the past twenty years a new wave of scholarly work has countered the traditional view at every stage. Notions of primitivism, decline, manipulation, scepticism and personal (as against collective) religion are now rightly viewed with suspicion. Instead, we are beginning to get a more 6-2 139 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">complex and interesting picture which tries to make sense of the religious practices of the late Republic and the Empire. W. offers an introduction to this revaluation of Roman religion, aimed at those with some knowledge of the period. The book stands or falls on its argument, not on its presentation of sources or of secondary material. Unfortunately the central idea is both borrowed without acknowledgement and also grossly overstated. The book runs from 200 B.C. to A.D. 400. Wisely eschewing, for the most part, speculation on early Rome, W. starts with a sketch of the gods, temples and priesthoods of Republican Rome, which formed the framework of the traditional religion (see also H. H. Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic [1981]). His second chapter, on the late Republic, argues that the changes in the religious system should not be seen as decline, but as characteristics of Roman traditionalism which, paradoxically, welcomed innovation. The argument forms the core of the book, but W. fails to enlighten the reader that credit for this important idea is due to J. A. North (PBSR 44 [1976], 1-12). W. argues that manipulation is perfectly compatible with belief, that there was only some decline ('disruption' would be a better term), that philosophy was not a corrosive force and that the senate did not set out to deny true spiritual fare to the people. (On this last issue more could have been made of the Bacchanalia affair in the light of North, PCPhS [1979], 85-103.) After a helpful chapter on the Augustan period (ch. 3), W. turns to the later imperial period (chs. 4-6), continuing to apply his model of tradition/innovation. However, he runs into serious difficulties. He argues, implausibly, that the Roman religious system was not 'mainly defensive towards the eastern religions' (p. 109) and that these oriental cults mostly conformed 'with the existing gods of the public order' (p. 120). If that was true, what was their attraction? W. should have taken account of the work of R. L. Gordon (e.g. Religion 2 [1972], 92-121), who stresses the discontinuities between traditional cults and Mithraism. The theory of innovative polytheism also induces W. to present an implausible picture of the rise of Christianity. 'The key to understanding the move from polytheism to Christianity is to remember that some of the practices and cult-acts were alike...' (p. 103). Neither Paul nor Porphyry would have agreed with this view. It is surely also wrong to suggest that Constantine at first turned to the Christian god simply as another 'deity who could be reliable in war' (p. 173). A religion which had been subject to systematic imperial persecution was not just one more cult. W. asks why the Roman religious system failed in the end. In addition to social and economic changes W. suggests that the system had 'exhausted the possible supply of strange or new gods' (p. 102; cf, p. 110). This curious view arises from W.'s general theory that paganism has an 'acquisitive dynamic' (p. 27). 'The polytheon (a better term than pantheon) is entirely open, like a temple with an infinite number of niches' (p. 3); similarly, 'it was in the nature of the polytheistic state to accept new gods, not to decline them' (p. 123). This is a reductio ad absurdum of North's view of the place of innovation in Roman religion: innovation was dangerous, not desirable in itself, and needed traditional sanction. This book is less easy to follow than it might have been (though it helps if the 'conclusions' are read first). This is partly because of a failure to unify individual chapters and partly because individual paragraphs contain too many throw-away lines. More seriously, W. produces what is almost a parody of someone else's fruitful idea. Nonetheless, the first three chapters of the book will not seriously mislead the novice.

Lyon: Institut d'etudes indo-europeennes de l'Universite Jean Moulin (Lyon III), 1982. Paper. The attempt to penetrate by internal reconstruction into the remoter prehistory of a proto- language is an intriguing but not always profitable occupation. The author of this short monograph strives to avoid the pitfalls of 'glottogonie' by careful attention to the functions as well as the forms of the elements under consideration, and by the use of developmental parallels from the history of recorded Indo-European languages. Starting from the so-called ' syncopated finals' of the Vedic language (more properly to be regarded as old uninflected forms) he develops a theory of the origin of the case-endings, which are traced to earlier postpositional elements still sometimes found occurring elsewhere in a free state. 140 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW</page></plain_text>
