Reviewed by Karen Kurczynski We are witnessing the apotheosis of Eva Hesse. Hesse's work in sculpture as well as drawing and painting was long recognized by artists and critics. But until recently it was known primarily through a long interview by Cindy Nemser from 1970, and Lucy Lippard's 1976 monograph, which remains the single extant monograph of the artist (until Elisabeth Sussman completes her own volume in progress).1 As the essays in the anthology Encountering Eva Hesse describe in detail, these early writings shaped for three decades our conception of Hesse as a particular kind of woman artist struggling to establish her autonomy?from her traumatic past, from her chauvinist husband, the sculptor Tom Doyle, and from the general structure of the 1960s New York art world, avowedly male-dominated in both its established social hierarchies and an aggressively anti-humanist formal rigor, which left no room for personal concerns then labeled "feminine." Hesse's tragic early death from a brain tumor made her an art martyr in 1970.2 The possibility that this illness might have been caused directly or indirectly by the experimental materials of her art?the toxicity of resin or fiberglass?makes her the ultimate martyr (beyond even Van Gogh) because she could have literally died for her art. All five recent publications on Hesse make valuable contributions. The three anthologies (abbreviated in page references as DR for Drawing, SC for Sculpture, EN for Encountering) contribute insights into process and interpretation, and the Catalogue Raisonn? (CR in page references) is an indispensable resource. Nevertheless, the facsimile datebooks (DB in page references) and the accounts of the problems of making Hesse's most well known, now highly fragile works available for exhibition (described by several different authors) point to a historiographie situation of overt canonization in the most traditional, individualist terms. Anne Wagner's 1994 account, "Another Hesse," provides the most sophisticated attempt thus far to separate the complex meanings embodied in Hesse's work from the overdetermined understanding of Hesse herself resulting from precisely this sort of art-historical hagiography, developed over the past thirty years in relation to an attractive, female, seemingly self-absorbed and traumatized artist, who died young, tragically and innocently.3 Unlike some contemporary scholars, I welcome the accounts of thorough and engaging writers like Anna Chave to explore the relationship of Hesse's long series of illnesses to a broader history of feminine identity in her controversial 1992 essay,4 or Griselda Pollock in Encountering Eva Hesse, to relate the tragedy of Hesse's family losses in the Holocaust and its aftermath to her work's iconology. Yet I remain acutely wary of the danger of further reifying Hesse as a special kind of saint?the singularly victimized persona which such texts still inescapably imply, even those as mindful and deliberate as Pollock's?when the reason we care about Hesse in the first place is because of her creative work. Hesse would have been the first to laugh at such a prospect of heroization.5 As Pollock notes in Encountering Eva Hesse, the "sacralization" of Hesse began immediately with the articles published just after her death (EN32). Hesse's own extensive personal writings led critics to focus on her person, and thus narrow the possible readings of her art. Hesse herself asserted in the Nemser interview, for example, that "I have confidence in my understanding of the formal to the point that I don't play with it. [...] So it is inevitable that it is my life, my feelings, my thoughts...." (EN217). Such unam biguous assertions that Hesse's process related intimately to her personal subjec tivity set in motion a particularly feminist tendency to conflate her life and art in the 1970s, despite the obvious problem that without Hesse to formulate what that sub jectivity is or was, we are left only with our own interpretations arising inevitably from our own psychic dramas. Such inter pretations hardly relate on the universal level, where her abstract sculpture speaks so eloquently. The notorious fragility and insistent decay of her deliberately experi mental processes, moreover, have led collectors to an unusual degree of protec tiveness over what Renate Petzinger refers to as their "fragile treasures" (EN162), compounding the fetishization which normally accrues to unique, non functional objects. The apotheosis of Eva Hesse in the academic and museological discourses of art history seems complete now that we can hold in our hands that foundational canonizing document, the Catalogue Raisonn?, produced in a beautiful edition of glossy color pages encased in a silvery silk sheen; and even more deliciously, two facsimiles of her tiny personal datebooks. These records of her years with Tom Doyle in Kettwig-on-the Ruhr, Germany, in 1964-65, are replete with notations in blue "pen" and script so ingeniously messy it needed decoding in a separate typed transcript, of all Hesse's daily meetings and impressions in these formative years. Hesse was a perfect candidate for sainthood, not only FALL / WINTER 2007 O</page><page sequence="2">because she was an art martyr but also because, as a particularly fragile and characteristically feminine creature (according to her diaries and to readings by Nemser, Lippard, Chave, and Pollock), perhaps she perfectly evokes the absolute benevolence of the female saint. How can Hesse's life help us now? Could we be comforted in some way by flipping through her datebooks with our own all-too-human hands as she, herself, once did? Why we need this fetishistic facsimile of her daybooks is beyond me. They are replete with highly important details like a trip to see the movie Marriage Italian Style (March 14, 1964); "all day in Scarsdale" (September 29, 1964); references to her repeated cramps, anxiety, and other maladies; and cryptic observations like "on my birthday all the workers celebrated with us" (January 11, 1965). Actually, perhaps I do understand: a saint requires relics. But art is, after all, a fetish in our soci ety. I have never joined the camp of icon oclasts like Guy Debord who insist solely on decrying this situation; a bit of pleas ure is always in order. The datebooks impart some of the excitement of original archival research worthy of the recent tel evision series "History Detectives." They also have a particular relevance consider ing not only the historical tendency to pin Hesse's self to her work, but also contem poraneous observations by both Mel Bochner and Robert Smithson that, in Smithson's words, "She had no external notion of a world out side hers. I saw her as a very interior person making psychic models" (DB1). After Hesse's psychoanalyst advised her to keep a diary in her teenage years, she devel oped what Lippard called a "near obsession with autobiography" (DB2). The juicy person al details have a prob lematic tendency to make us believe we know the artist or, worse, understand her as a person. Yet the date books also contain con structive art-historical insights, providing real food for thought, for example in the fact that Hesse saw Kenneth Noland's work on June 9, 1964; or particularly liked Pierre Alechinsky, Asger J?rn, and Alain Davie at Documenta III on June 29; or began a work (now lost) in lead wire but changed to plaster when she ran out of metal on December 4. While the diaries of this period (now archived at the Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin College, and microfilmed in the Archives of American Art) reveal a Hesse "inwardly torn up, bitterly rejecting and yet opti mistically clinging to her problematic relationship with Doyle" (DB4), one is hard put to find any direct evidence of these or any feelings other than illnesses in Hesse's laconic notations of people who came to dinner, movies she saw, dates she got her period, and monu ments studied on her travels.6 In fact, the entries become driest at the very nadir of her breakup with Doyle in August 1965. Anne Wagner observes that the diaries are not mirrors of Hesse's inner life but in fact profoundly performative, as noted by Sabine Folie (DB7).7 Folie takes pains to assert that the diaries "offer a self-presentation in fragmented form" (DB10) and that we must then resist the tendency to read into Hesse the very physically and psychologically tortured personality which manifests there. Such a consciousness is requisite in the histor ical researcher, but not necessarily pres ent in the average museumgoer or book collector. I, for one, find it not only beside the point but distinctly unpleas ant to read Hesse's repeated notations of her doctor visits, colds, cramps, boils, and broken toes. Hesse's public statements often frankly contradicted her private ones regarding the relation of her emotional history to her work. In public texts such as the gallery statement for her landmark 1968 show, "Chain Polymers," Hesse did not describe any personal expressive intentions but rather the opposite, stating for example that her goal was a "non logical self" and a sculpture that is "nothing" (SC9). This contradiction presents a compelling paradox for a woman artist whose public and private personas seemed so at odds, a traumatic personal history marked by Jewish and feminine identity publicly silenced by Hesse herself in the context of the explicitly masculine field of minimalist inspired sculpture, with its absolute rejection of the personal, and only brought to light later as part of the feminist reaction against that culture. Benjamin Buchloh perhaps best expresses the social dimension of this problem, which it must be remembered faces any artist, male or female, in a mass-mediated society. In Eva Hesse Drawing, he refers to Hesse's "deeply seated epistemological skepticism (and her awareness of the necessity of resisting the instant spectacularization of all public declamations of subjective autonomy)" (DR150), thus portraying her as an active historical agent and not a victim of feminine circumstance. Given her deliberate choice to maintain this strict separation between her public and private personae in her lifetime, one wonders what Hesse herself would have made of this overt spectacularization of her personal effects by contemporary fans insistent on making public her entire persona as the stuff of genius. The Catalogue Raisonn? project has published the first two of four planned volumes. Volumes I and II cover painting and sculpture, respectively, while Volumes III and IV will focus on drawings.

The Paintings volume provides a lush record of Hesse's student work, begin ning at Pratt Institute in the early 1950s, demonstrating her facility with styles ranging from Abstract Expressionism to monochromes made under Josef Albers at Yale, to the distinctive, emphatically material and playful, bold, deliberately mechanical figurai paintings she made in the 1960s. In Encountering Eva Hesse, Alison Rowley considers some of these works, in particular seeming one-offs like P 105 (No Title) (1961; Fig. 1). Rowley makes an excellent case for considering this work in relation to Pablo Picasso as well as Helen Frankenthaler, an artist equally concerned with problems of sen timent and intellect, materiality and con ceptual structure, issues much closer than previously thought to Hesse's own con cerns at the time. The Sculpture volume includes both test pieces and the more familiar canonized sculptures, plus sever al previously unknown works such as the diminutive, hybrid painted objects made in 1964 which open the sequence. The major perplexing aspect of the catalogue is the inexplicable substitution of old black and-white photographs for several major works which appear nowhere in color. Obviously due to the extreme brittleness and fragility of pieces like Vertiginous Detour (1966) (S 29), or Expanded Expansion (1969) (S 148; Fig. 2), the owning institu tions (in this case the Hirschhorn and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museums, respectively) refused to allow the works to be photographed in their current delicate state. Although the editors were able to at least find multiple images of the works from historic exhibitions, including a few in color, the result is a fetishization of the works in their "original" (or at least earli er) permutations, which goes directly against the wishes of the artist herself, according to contemporary colleagues like fabricator Doug Johns (EN92). In the case of works currently on view, such as Vinculum II (1969) (S 147), at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the substitution of a historical image seems perplexing. Griselda Pollock's essay "A Very Long Engagement: Singularity and Difference in the Critical Writing on Eva Hesse" makes a strong case for the relevance of biographical detail and the possibilities of subjective interpretation in expand ing the contemporary rele vance of Eva Hesse's work. Taking direct issue with viewers who prefer to leave Hesse's female and Jewish identities "at the door," Pollock begins her essay with a careful recounting of what overtly feminist schol arship willing to investigate the relevance of the personal has illuminated about Hesse. Her account provides iUuminating perspectives on the often unfairly maligned writings of Nemser, Lippard, and Chave, as well as the less controver sial interpretations of Linda Norden, Briony Fer, and Anne Wagner. Pollock argues that January was a particularly bleak month for Hesse, particularly in 1966, when her mother had been dead for twenty years as of January 9, and by her birthday on January 11, she had been alive for thirty. This was precisely the month when Hesse made the sculpture Hang Up, consisting of a carefully wrapped frame shaded from grey to white, with a ca. 11-foot cord looping diagonally out into the viewer's space. Hang Up was a turning point in her work; Hesse referred to it in conversation with Nemser as "the most important sculpture I made" (EN38). Although, like Wagner before her, Pollock argues for the maximum openness and complexity in interpreting Hesse, she winds up policing the interpretive field in relation to Hang Up when she asserts that Wagner's reading of the sculpture as a window, recalling the one out of which Hesse's mother committed suicide, cannot be right, because Hang Up is horizontal, not vertical (39). Nevertheless, she builds on Wagner's conscientious interweaving of biography and formal analysis in relat ing not only Hang Up but also Hesse's series of late "window drawings" to the trauma of death conceived more broadly than merely the maternal loss. Pollock explores the Holocaust as a major person al and historical cause of that sense of loss, one which has been overlooked in femi nist criticism. While this interpretation seems apt, her comparison of Hesse's win dow iconography to that of the overtly expressionist, insistently figurative Holocaust survivor and self-taught artist Charlotte Salomon pushes too far. The unnecessary and misleading comparison implies that Hesse's windows were noth ing more than that, when in fact their material construction is much more open ended, evocative, and iconographically complex, as Wagner herself demonstrated in the earlier essay. Pollock both argues for the availability of all possible read ings of Hesse and develops her particular account focused on "the urgency of a sin gle life lived in relation to loss" (EN52). In this way, the difficulty for even such a subtle scholar as Pollock?one of the most significant feminist art historians writing today?to maintain an open minded tolerance for disagreement while advancing a specific reading becomes apparent. Pollock's essay ends by mar ginalizing the resilient and vital humor that defined both Hesse's personality and her art at least as much as her wounded ness. Lippard's early monograph remains one of the texts which does most justice to the particular combination of Fig. 2.

FALL / WINTER 2007 f?k</page><page sequence="4">tragedy and comedy Hesse's work entails. This complementary disruption of social convention through a seeming excess of both trauma and humor allies it to the irreverent tradition of the grotesque.9 Perhaps Maurice Berger said it best in his own discussion of Hang Up in the 1992 Yale retrospective: In its humor and optimism, the work alludes not only to the "hang ups" associated with "mastering" the act of painting but to the broad er cultural relationship between sexual and social hang-ups and the lack of personal freedom. [...] In the process of breaking these rules [of formalist painting], [Hesse] extend ed modern sculpture toward "what is yet not known"?an abstract field where humor, eroticism, and discovery were permitted and ulti mately celebrated.10 Aside from Pollock's engaging intro duction and essay, and the important interview with fabricator Doug Johns (which I address below), Encountering Eva Hesse appears in some respects self-indul gent. It opens with a lavish collection of photographs of Hesse herself, looking cute at openings and posing in her studio, where she appears alternately contempla tive, distracted, forthright, or mysterious; such an opening immediately situates Hesse as important because she was young and attractive (a situation lamented by Wagner in "Another Hesse"). The images of Hesse's work in the volume, while lush and wide-ranging, are aggra vating in their complete disregard to medium, chronology, relevance to the articles, or any other discernible order.11 The rest of the texts are inconsistent in quality. Accounts by Vanessa Corby, Phyllida Barlow, and Joanna Greenhill of the authors' original encounters with Hesse's work in the 1970s illuminate the context of the authors' personal develop ment more than they provide any real insight into Hesse's work. Greenhill's text, for one, provides significant insight into the gendered nature of British sculp tural training in the 1970s. Corby, on the other hand, begins with a cringe-worthy account of her student assignment to study Hesse's drawings, punctuated by irrelevant details. Corby decides halfway into the essay what she actually wants to say, eventually focusing on Hesse's iden tity as a Holocaust refugee. Although she makes some problematic assumptions about Hesse's personal response to sur viving the Holocaust by examining unrelated accounts by other survivors in New York, her insight into both the like lihood of how the events of Hesse's childhood affected her as an artist and the methodological shifts affecting Hesse scholarship provides a significant correc tive to the exclusive focus on gender?and the relative suppression of Jewish identity?established by Nemser and Lippard. Eva Hesse: Sculpture catalogues a small show at the Jewish Museum, the first Hesse show in New York in thirty years. It brought together most of the work from Hesse's sole one-woman sculpture exhibi tion of 1968, "Chain Polymers" at Fischbach Gallery, plus supporting draw ings and test pieces, a few later works, and a selection of archival documents from the Allen Memorial Art Museum, including diaries by both Hesse and her father. The documents were presented in a small sep arate room along with films of Hesse in her studio. At the exhibition, people tend ed to spend as much time in the cramped documents room as they did in the exhibi tion galleries, which indicates at once the relevance of Hesse's story to the audience of the Jewish museum, and the fact that Hesse's art would benefit from a much greater emphasis on the description of the works themselves, which in their singular materials and evocative abstraction require particularly adept explanation for the average museumgoer. The essays in Eva Hesse: Sculpture accomplish this deli cate balance well, with Elisabeth Sussman, Yve-Alain Bois, and Mark Godfrey addressing the particularities of Hesse's sculpture, and Fred Wasserman examin ing in detail the diaries of Hesse and her father in a separate section following the color plates of the catalogue. Wasserman's text provides, for those interested in Hesse's family history, the most in-depth account thus far of Hesse's father's Tageb?cher, recording her family origins in Hamburg, difficult emigration, and child hood in New York, where she lost her mother. The catalogue closes with a biog raphical chronology, and photographs of the artist are thankfully confined to these latter two sections of the book. The three articles addressing Hesse's sculpture are brief but to the point, supplementing the existing Hesse literature with specific insights. Sussman establishes the social context of Hesse's work around the time of her "Chain Polymers" exhibition and details the preparation and reception of the exhibition, which is the primary focus of the Jewish Museum show. Sussman's straightforward account ends with a useful discussion of the "aftermath" of the sculptures Hesse showed at Fischbach Gallery, including their subsequent whereabouts and their current physical condition. The Jewish Museum exhibition included some rarely seen latex works including Aught (1968), a landmark work consisting of four large, textured, roughly rectangular slabs hanging from metal grommets (whose history and unpredictable material volatility Sussman discusses in Encountering Eva Hesse [EN173]). Here she describes how Hesse was ambivalent about the inevitable deterioration of her sculpture, wondering whether she should "write [collectors] a letter and say it's not going to last" (SC15). Yet she refused to even consider using more traditional, permanent materials, asserting that "Life doesn't last; art doesn't last" (SC15). Perhaps because Sussman already faced this issue head on in 2002, arranging the roundtable discussion on the conservation of Hesse's sculpture which accompanied the San Francisco retrospective,12 Sussman takes no position on the issue, leaving it up to collectors to decide what to do with their property. She again leaves unanswered the questions she had already raised in her essay for the 2002 catalogue.13 More illuminating on this point is the interview in Encountering Eva Hesse with Doug Johns, who fabricated many of Hesse's sculptures. Johns was not present at the 2002 roundtable, but ran a workshop in Leeds that year on working with latex and fiberglass which proved immensely illuminating to many of the volume's authors who were present. Although opinions will continue to ?f| WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="5">diverge on this matter, I cannot but agree with Johns when he laments that major works like Contingent (1969) will never be seen again because of their fragility. We should take seriously Johns's suggestion to mount an exhibition in which the original works in their varying states of decomposition would be paired with temporary newly-fabricated versions under the supervision of himself and Hesse's later assistants. Such a show would powerfully illuminate the material effects of texture and light that characterized the works when Hesse created them. Mark Godfrey's essay on Hesse's hang ing works takes a similar straightforward approach, combining the historical with a detailed formal analysis focusing on Hesse's two late hanging pieces: Right After, the delicate fiberglass piece of 1969, and Untitled (Rope Piece) of 1970. Godfrey considers Hesse's hanging sculpture in the context of other suspended works by both Hesse's contemporaries and later artists of the 1990s, in order to draw out its unique qualities of irregularity, delicacy, and implications of both protective cover ing and entrapment or netting. His detailed examination of Right After proves illuminating, considering the work's unique qualities: its unexpected material, fiberglass coated almost invisibly with resin; its deathlike refusal of movement; and its singular combination of the cate naries hanging gracefully from support ing S-hooks with the working over of the material by Hesse and Johns that resulted in frayed and messy ends disrupting its graceful sequence. Godfrey's account of 1960s hanging sculptures by artists like Robert Grosvenor, Robert Morris, Louise Bourgeois, and others provides a useful reminder that sculpture in that decade was not, in fact, all about horizontality and the floor, as overemphasized in the recent scholarship of Rosalind Krauss. Yet his litany of contemporary hanging pieces by Cornelia Parker, Eva Rothschild, and others seems superfluous. At the end of his essay, Godfrey mentions in passing a highly relevant work, Reticul?rea by the Venezuelan artist Gego, shown in a New York gallery the same year as Right After and sharing its netlike quality and domi nation of a space through an arguably feminine, delicate and transparent, expandable medium. He would have done better to eliminate some of the superfluous contemporary descriptions in favor of an in-depth exploration of the for mal similarities and, perhaps, historical encounter of these two works by German refugee artists on different continents? how fascinating that both works appeared in openings in New York within days of each other! By passing over this opportu nity, Godfrey maintains the unfortunately widespread institutional separation of contemporary European and American from Latin American art that has kept us from understanding such connections for too long. Yve-Alain Bois's essay draws on art historical accounts by Annette Michelson, Rosalind Krauss, Mignon Nixon, and Briony Fer relating Hesse's sculpture to the psychoanalytic theory of the part-object defined by the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein. The part object is a form that belongs to a body but is read by the infant as a semi separate entity (the prime example being the breast). The infant projects onto the part-object her boundless desire but also her rage and envy, so that it later comes to signify infantile subjectivity at a moment of traumatic lack of control and differentiation.14 Bois wants to contribute to this literature by suggesting that while the part-object theory aptly describes Hesse's early work until around 1966, her work of ca. 1966-70 constitutes a "late style" which rejects its earlier relationship to the organic, the sexual, and the anthropomorphic. The late sculpture moves beyond these qualities, according to Bois, by making use of serial structures and rejecting the internal relationalism of its earlier reliance on "appendages" such as the cords that dangle from her sculptural units or link separate parts (SC24). Thus, while the 1967 model for Accretion consists of cardboard and sculpmetal tubes on a pedestal with vinyl cords dangling down from the tubes to the floor, the final sculpture of 1968 (one of the most powerful elements of the Jewish Museum show, which did not include the model) eliminated the vinyl cords and moved the tubes, now enlarged in fiberglass and resin, to a vertical position set directly on the floor in a potentially expandable accumulation. Bois's explicitly formalist model inscribes an explicitly artificial teleology onto an oeuvre Hesse herself repeatedly described as organic, non-linear, non hierarchical, and absurd. I see little point in trying to shape Hesse's brief career into such a traditional art-historical category as the "late style." To do so, Bois depends on identifying "transitional" works such as Schema and Sequel of 1967-68 , which de-locate the part-object by serializing it, and he is forced to sidestep works like Vinculum I-II, which distort this lineage with their inclusion of both serial parts and "appendages" hanging down. Bois's account also privileges the minimalist aspects of Hesse's "late" work?its large scale, direct relationship to the confines of the room, and seriality?while disregarding the very departures from minimalism that make it unique: its intuitive or random compositional arrangements, its symbolic bodily references so aptly described by the theory of the part-object even in the later phase, and its visceral relationship in texture, color, and form to the body of the viewer. Bois ends with an evocative comparison of Accession III, the large cubic metal piece pierced with holes in which Hesse inserted strips of fiberglass tubing, to the idea of "a nail that has just been cut, a bit glistening, but already destined to dust" (SC27). This overt bodily reference recalls if not the part-object itself, the disjecta identified by Julia Kristeva in her classic account of abjection, describing elements once part of the body but now made separate which destabilize our conscious distinction between self and other, thus uncannily recalling the pre-subjective oceanic state to which Klein's theory of the part-object also refers.15 Bois is an expert at the subtleties of evocative and precise visual description and iconology, but his reliance on linear chronology limits the usefulness of this formalist treatment of Hesse's sculpture. The most valuable new contribution to the Hesse scholarship in depth and perspective is Eva Hesse Drawing, both for what it illuminates about her work and for what it reveals about the practice and iconology of contemporary drawing in FALL / WINTER 2007 ?</page><page sequence="6">general. The project catalogues a 2006 exhibition co-organized by The Drawing Center, New York City, and the Menil Collection, Houston, and curated by Catherine de Zegher and Elisabeth Sussman. The bulk of the catalogue is devoted to significant new scholarly insights on Hesse's previously overlooked drawing practice by art historians and Hesse scholars, including de Zegher, Sussman, Wagner, Buchloh, Briony Fer, Mignon Nixon, Bracha Ettinger, and Kathryn Tuma. Hesse's drawing was intimately related to her sculpture?in fact, this volume makes clear that in many ways line and surface were driving forces for both and bound the two purportedly separate media intimately together in Hesse's artistic dialogue. As she herself stated in the Nemser interview, to translate her drawings into painting "was not natural and I thought to translate it in some other way. So I started working with relief and with line?using the cords and ropes that are now so commonly used. I literally translated the line" (DR145). Catherine de Zegher perhaps best describes this intimate situation in her insightful comparison of Hesse's use of line and knotwork to the drawing, painting, and weaving practices of Anni Albers, whose husband, Josef Albers, was Hesse's teacher. The relationship between "Anni" and "Eva" becomes for de Zegher not a personal or historical one but a potential "matrilineal kinship within the Modernist legacy" (DR74). De Zegher makes the plausible case that while Hesse would have consciously suppressed any such maternal influences out of her personally traumatic separations, both literal and psychic, from her emotionally troubled mother, an evident retrospective dialogue links the two artists. The work of both artists emphasized operations of materiality and touch, as activated by sinuous linear form as well as overt connections to craft, which are marginalized even today in the discourse of modernism. De Zegher's elegant approach focuses on form without suppressing biography, and develops in the process new insights into the relationalist aspects of drawing. Reading about Hesse's approach to, as the artist described in her working notes, line as a "link, that which binds; bond, tie, connecting medium" (93), I was struck by the profundity of this function in the sculpture Hang Up: how the long cord jutting out from the wrapped frame is a kind of lasso radically reaching into our literal space, as if trying to draw us into Hesse's world in an overt if abstract call (not a cry but a call) for psychic connection? whether we view that world as one of trauma and loss or of exuberant (and ambivalent) optimism embodied in the modernist legacy of abstraction.16 This relational aspect remains primary for me, even if the sculpture, with its closed loop, refuses as much as it solicits our approach?a typical Hesse paradox.17 "Drawing," as de Zegher observes, "is a form of intimacy as much as of conver sation" (DR99). She draws out the impli cations of this profoundly feminist knowl edge without the alienating jargon typical of Bracha Ettinger, whose contribution, "Gaze-and-Touching the Not Enough Mother," overtly addresses the desires for reconcilation with the maternal inherent in Hesse's work, but in such a way as to read more like a manifesto of Ettinger's matrixial theory than a detailed engage ment with Hesse's art. Ettinger's theory, a feminist response to the Lacanian empha sis on the phallus as primary symbol of lack and thus a significant contribution to psychoanalytic discourse, is all-encom passing in its universalist approach and thus demands belief or total rejection from anyone not iinmersed in her disciplinary language.18 It is precisely the rigor of her psychoanalytic terms, though, that initial ly reads as jargon (although it is not) and I welcome the presence of such overtly non art-historical readings for such a complex artist as Hesse. Ettinger's theory requires belief because, like many psychoanalytic approaches, it proposes universal struc tures impossible to "verify" or deny on any rational grounds because they are pre conscious. Reading various texts by Ettinger over the years, I have come to believe that her inventive critical terminol ogy, as off-putting as it first appears, con tributes profound insight into the human condition as I experience it. Despite its totalizing tendency, I consider deeply illu minating her description of Hesse's endless search for cording, perforating, and "nippling" as in part a kind of borderlinking to a combination of a Not Enough Mother psychic thread, a dead mother thread, a Dead Mother thread, and an "ideal mother" thread combined with strings of gaze-and-touching in repetition and strings of virtual not-enoughness that supply copoeietic energy for repetition-in-difference and for matrixial transference between the traumatic, the phantasmatic, and the virtual (DR206-8). My reference to Ettinger's theory as a belief system does not negate its legiti macy in any way; it simply means that my own assertion of belief will not help the reader one way or another through the personal but necessary process of working through her complex and provocative psychoanalytic framework in order to comprehend it?alternately to accept it as possible, or to reject it.19 Another profound contribution which illuminates not only Hesse's work but our understanding of the meaning of drawing in the 1960s is Benjamin Buchloh's essay, "Hesse's Endgame: Facing the Diagram." As both the title and the author's past writing suggest, Buchloh's perspective is monolithic, teleological, and melancholic, but nevertheless contributes a critical new (actually, classic and modernist) interpre tation of the relationship of drawing in Hesse's oeuvre to its function in a number of key modernist predecessors and col leagues, including Duchamp, Malevich, Oldenburg, LeWitt, and Johns. (The fact that all of his examples are male must not have seemed relevant to the author, but it glares). For Buchloh, Eva Hesse's drawing continues a "project" begun by the machine diagrams of Duchamp and Picabia, an all-encompassing attempt to place the body in relation to the preexist ing structures ("matricial orders") of con temporary liberal-capitalist society. Thus, Hesse's task is "to operate, on the one hand, within a system of bodily innerva tions that internalize the matrices of advanced forms of reification and, on the other, to pursue an articulation of subjec tivity (of the artist as much as of the view er) that insists on recording the residual ? WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="7">and resistant forms of bodily authenticity and psychic autonomy" (DR122). Buchloh dismisses the drawings before ca. 1964 and privileges the grid drawings from 1966 onwards as exemplifying Hesse's ultimate contribution to this problematic. In a teleology that at times echoes Bois's formalism, he identifies these grid draw ings, the most minimalist works of Hesse's career, as her ultimate contribu tion: "Hesse had finally understood that the diagrammatic would have to become central to the future of her drawings" (DR135). As in his previous writings, Buchloh presents a substantial number of historical pairings which appear as a com plete map of the historical and technical "possibilities" available to modern artists. Thus, Hesse's friends Claes Oldenburg and Sol LeWitt embody the twin poles of sculptural possibility: sculpture must either present bodily plenitude in the very form of the commodity which alienates it (Oldenburg), or withdraw all bodily refer ence in order to constitute the "final dis embodiment and total deskilling" (LeWitt) which alone makes art able to register an ideological critique of the socially imposed alienation from the body in contemporary society that makes draw ing in the traditional sense outmoded (140). Buchloh's description of Hesse's late grid drawings as her unique contribution to the necessary "resistance and remem brance" of drawing not only subsumes Hesse into a minimalism akin to the proj ects of LeWitt and Hanne Darboeven, but also completely discounts the symbolic associations overtly explored in her late "window" drawings of the same time. Buchloh's account is valuable both for its rich insights, however schematic, into the history of drawing from Dada to Conceptualism, and for its refreshing positioning of Hesse's art as ideological critique?the trauma, for once, relates to contemporary social life rather than to femininity, the trauma of the Holocaust, or psychic lack. The most significant prob lem with Buchloh's account, however, is its tendency toward melancholy, which limits Hesse's art to a retrospective nostal gia for some lost bodily plenitude (one wonders in which historical period Buchloh would locate such an Eden, or if he would be forced to turn to psychoana lytic theories of a universal lack). Could we not equally read Hesse's drawing as forward-looking rather than retrospec tive?evoking, for example, the liberating qualities of the contemporary cyborg as discussed by Donna Haraway in the poly mechanomorphic perversity of her 1964-65 drawing experiments?20 When Buchloh asserts that Hesse's "endgame" announces "drawing's decisive tendency towards historical disappearance" (DR146) we must ask in turn whether it remains productive to talk about the "dis appearance" of a medium so obviously thriving in contemporary art?or whether the expressivity of drawing is only irrele vant to a select group of melancholic crit ics marked by the utter political cynicism and ultimate refusal of historical agency formulated by postwar writers like Theodor Adorno or Guy Debord in theo ries questionable in their applicability for contemporary Ufe. I doubt it was with deliberate irony that the editors of Eva Hesse Drawing placed Elisabeth Sussman's essay on Hesse's "Works on Paper/Works in the Paper" just after Buchloh's intepretation of Hesse's drawing project as a deliberate "resistance" to a totally administered world (DR145). Yet this placement under scores the problems inherent in Sussman's approach, despite the fact that she is per haps our most knowledgeable contempo rary Hesse scholar, with unmatched understanding of her subject's oeuvre and unequaled clarity in her verbal presenta tion of it. However, it is precisely this clar ity that I find as much troubling as illumi nating in Sussman's writing, because its objective tone masks an ideological invest ment (whether conscious or not) in certain reified aspects of the discipline of art his tory: namely its tendencies to elevate an individual artist as extraordinarily talent ed and to exhaustively organize in a com partmentalized linear trajectory every aspect of that individual's work?in other words, to administer it. The art historian in this traditional situation becomes a safe keeper of the information that bolsters the value both cultural (often national) and economic of an artist's body of work, and literally makes it marketable by organiz ing it. What bothers me about Sussman's essay here is that her normally laudatory attention to detail becomes overtly admin istrative and retrograde in the context of separating for discussion a body of Hesse's drawings that belong to those tra ditional art-historical categories of the preparatory sketch and/or the artist's own administrative post-production records. Sussman's title is a coy way of avoiding the phrase "working drawings" in the context of Mel Bochner's famous conceptual art exhibition of 1966, "Working Drawings and Other Visible Tilings on Paper Not Necessarily Meant To Be Viewed As Art," precisely because that exhibition overtly challenged the tra ditional art-historical positioning of draw ing which Sussman inadvertently restores. She does this through a series of close readings of diaristic and process-oriented drawings in which Hesse works out her (unique, unprecedented) artistic plans and perspectives for the (unique, implicitly more valuable) sculptures. In fact, Kathryn Tuma discusses in her text in the same volume that Hesse never really made direct sketches, but drew in an intu itive and explorative way, with an open ended and experimental process that shifted not only between media, but also between objects and words (DR232). Sussman's essay distinctly contrasts with the other contributions to Eva Hesse Drawings, all of which break open the standard art-historical category of draw ing in ways which hint at the reasons why drawing has in fact taken on such unprecedented importance in contempo rary culture. Rejecting the art-historical tendency to mobilize drawing as a reifica tion of the unique perspective of a privi leged and fetishized artistic subjectivity, the other essays re-situate it as a critical inter-media practice in relation to various themes, whether in Mignon Nixon's exploration of the psychic drive toward pre-subjective emotional territory in Hesse's relationship to children's draw ing, or in Buchloh's examination of Hesse's diagrammatic tendencies as criti cal of the loss of bodily plenitude in the overt antihumanism of a rationally organ ized and consumption-driven society. In this context, Sussman's perspective unfor tunately reads as a clear manifestation of that tendency toward the total adminis tration of art decried by Buchloh and oth ers, which utterly separates each human subject from the creative potential within ourselves by reifying it in the carefully FALL / WINTER 2007 O</page><page sequence="8">guarded histories of a few select artists. I believe it is crucial for art historians and curators to maintain a critical perspective toward our discipline in order to avoid these inherent ideological pitfalls in the drive toward clarity. Otherwise, such accounts unwittingly support the fetishization of the individual artist inher ent in projects such as the publication of Hesse's Datebooks. All five of these books present some sort of insight, if at times flawed or fetishized, into the life and the artistic practice of what Griselda Pollock refers to as "Eva Hesse" in quotation marks (EN14), an acknowledgement that while we have inevitably lost the artist, we continue to engage in contemporary dialogues which shape the "space in culture" that represents her life and work. What becomes clear upon reading the wealth of perspectives opened up by these new contributions in dialogue with those of decades prior is that what appear to be two "camps" in the Hesse scholarship?those concerned above all with biography and thus identity, and those focused more or less exclusively on form?actually circle in their explorations around the same small number of (infinitely large) themes: the wound, loss, trauma, resistance, autonomy, humor, resilience, pleasure, pain, paradox, the absurd. While some writers foreground the biographical sources of these themes, others consider them universal psychic states, or inevitable responses to our particular contemporary society. Really only Buchloh addresses the latter at all adequately, and further scholarship would do well to explore the social and economic politics, in addition to the identity politics, of Hesse's art. We may have lost a valuable artist and an incredible potential cut short by the cruelty of illness, but what a richness of understanding and material engagement we continue to gain.

This impression of counterproductive chaos persists even given its relationship to a par ticular presentation style practiced by Pollock (and others). In public engagements, Pollock often reads a highly complex text while playing an independent slide presen tation of relatively unrelated ?mages and text, presumably in order to break the audi ence's identification with the speaker's authority, but which often in my experience results in a simple headache.
