It seems to me that the question he actually raises is that of the taxonomic level at which contrasts exist within this culture, and between it and other entities similarly conceived. The real thrust of his argument is simply that the relationship between the local cultures subsumed under the term Fremont is more distant than others have implied. Clearly a recognizable Fremont entity does ex- ist, simply definable as those complexes north of the Anasazi area that share a distinctive grayware pottery tradition, anthropomorphic clay figurines, half-rod-and-bundle basketry, and maize cultivation (Wormington 1955; Marwitt 1970). That this entity has in practice been defined comparatively, by focusing on the ways in which it contrasts with the Anasazi, does not mean that it has no real existence, nor does it mean that our belief in its existence is a mere accident of the history of archaeological research. Surely comparison and contrast are still to be reckoned among the respected tools of our discipline. Madsen's use of this argument does, however, serve to emphasize his conviction that the local cultures that have been grouped under the term Fre- C.

I share this belief and feel that it opens up a line of inquiry well worth pursuing. The most exciting part of his paper is that in which Madsen presents evidence and argument for the use of wild plant foods by some Great Basin Sevier-Fremont villagers on a scale heretofore unimagined. The suggestion that wild foods, especially cattail, backed up the horticultural system and made possible a degree of stability and village growth exceeding that attested in the Colorado Plateau part of the Fremont range makes instant sense. Madsen's success in documenting the great importance of wild plant food resources at Backhoe Village will no doubt inspire other at- tempts, and his recognition of an overall food resource base in the Great Basin portion of the Fre- mont range that is both broader and deeper than that available on the Colorado Plateau will sure- ly spark new and interesting attempts to model and compare patterns of settlement and exploita- tion in the two areas. This new information suggesting a very stable resource base for the Great Basin Sevier- Fremont people also provides new food for thought on the question of the late twelfth or thir- teenth-century disintegration of the Fremont culture. Apparently, so far as is now known, the dis- integration took place at roughly the same time in both the Colorado Plateau and the Great Basin. Madsen's new data suggest that no simplistic model of worsening conditions for maize agriculture will suffice as an explanation, at least for the Great Basin side of the Fremont territory. We may be forced to come to grips with the difficult problem of devising analytical schemes capable of testing hypotheses of sociopolitically induced, rather than environmentally induced, cultural change. It is of interest, too, to consider that the exploitation of marsh and lakeshore resources is of an- cient standing over a very broad area of the Great Basin, and that in certain favored situations, the exploitation of wild plants and animals supported sedentary or semisedentary village settle- ments as long as 6,000 or 7,000 years ago (Aikens 1978:81-85). It begins to appear that the Fre- mont culture area may have important things to tell us about protoagricultural subsistence and the conditions precedent to the adoption of village agriculture.
