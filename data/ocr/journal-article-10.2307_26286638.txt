<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ends of a Genre1 R. Lane Kauffmann What we call his work was, for him, only an essay, an approach . . . —Maurice Merleau-Ponty, "Cézanne's Doubt" I. WHAT ARE THE "ENDS" of the essay? The question—phrased in the manner of Jean-François Lyotard's The Différend,2— was perhaps implicit in the opening words of Merleau-Ponty's famous essay on Cézanne.3 That essay already contained the seed of what may be seen as both a debt and a différend pending between Merleau-Ponty and Lyotard. A debt, insofar as Merleau-Ponty's phrase, "only an essay, an approach"—the "only" recalling Montaigne's ironic modesty in using the term—betrays a feeling, to be shared by Lyotard, that the stakes of the essay are high indeed. Its application to a painter shows that Merleau-Ponty does not consider the term (any more than does Lyotard) simply the name of a literary genre. Instead he takes the word essai (there and in another famous text) in its broader sense, as an experiment or project aiming beyond the self toward the unknown, the not-yet-thought; as a "thought in act" which renounces any intention of mastery or appropriation of its objects.4 It is this sense that thinkers such as Adorno and Lyotard draw upon in taking the essay as a genre of philosophical discourse. Lyotard will thus identity I he Vijjerend, his "book of philosophy," as "a discontinuous form of the Essay" (xiv). But Merleau-Ponty's gambit also prefigures a "différend" between his thought and that of Lyotard, insofar as it suggests that genres may be experienced differently by those who work in them (as one says) and by those who receive works shaped under their sign. The very category of experience, implying the existence of a "subject," lies near the center of that "humanism" and "anthropocentrism" whose refutation Lyotard lists among the chief stakes of The Différend: "To refute the prejudice anchored in the reader by centuries of humanism and of 'human sci ences' that there is 'man,' that there is 'language,' that the former makes use of the latter for its own ends. . (xiii). It is not this debt or this différend per se that I want to explore here— 62 Spring 1991</page><page sequence="2">Kauffmann though I will return to them—as much as it is the questions they raise: that of how the ends of a genre are determined and, more specifically, that of how the stakes of the essay are defined in Lyotard's works. In the idiom of The Différend, "phrases" from distinct "regimens" are not intertranslatable; they can only be "linked one onto the other in accor dance with an end fixed by a genre of discourse" (xii). Each genre is said to "imprint a unique finality onto a multiplicity of heterogeneous phrases by linkings that aim to procure the success proper to that genre" (129). "Do ends show up right along with genres? . . . They certainly do, and they take hold of phrases and instances they present, especially 'us.' 'We' do not intend them. Our 'intentions' are tensions (to link in a cer tain way) exerted by genres upon the addressors and addressees of phrases. . ." (136). Lyotard distinguishes between the rules of linkage that determine phrase regimens, and optional "modes" or "strategies" of linking through which to attain the specific finality or "end" of a genre. Related to Wittgenstein's "language games," Lyotard's genres of discourse are distinct insofar as they are "de-anthropomorphized" and declared to be "strategies—of no-one" (137). A question or two to orient this inquiry: Does each genre then have a fixed, singular or "unique" end? Or are there genres whose ends are multiple and overdetermined? Let us suppose that the question with which this essay began, con cerning the ends of the essay, forms the "canonical [interrogative] phrase" (137) defining the object of a particular discourse genre or (as I prefer for the moment) language game: namely, that subgenre (meta genre?) which is the essay on the essay. The undisputed master of that game, if Aldous Huxley is right, would be Montaigne himself—the rare case of a genre inventor who achieved "perfection" on the first try.5 If Montaigne got it right the first time, why should subsequent essayists keep trying? That they do suggests that the ends of genres mutate over time. If the object of this game were to "rewrite" the aims of the genre according to the terms of one's own philosophical program, the clear winner, among twentieth-century philosophical essayists, would be Theodor W. Adorno. Without affixing the label, Adorno persuasively defines the ends of the essay as those of negative dialectics ("victory" for Adorno).6 The "stakes" of the essay could be shown to be multiple and nonidentical in the two cases. Montaigne's skeptical critique of human reason did not preclude his pursuit of stoic wisdom and self-knowledge. Adorno's agenda did not include self-representation, but the essay's aims, in his version, were at once cognitive, ethical and aesthetic in Vol. XXXI, No. 1 63</page><page sequence="3">L'Esprit Créatêur nature. Which takes us back to the question of how genres and their ends are given: how do the values, interests and "ends" of essayists mesh with those embodied in constituted genres? The question may be broken into two parts: What have those ends been heretofore? And what can (and ought) they to be now? The first question is retrospective and "cognitive"—a matter for literary history. The other is prospective, ethical and experimental—a matter of practice. Analytically separate and heterogeneous, these questions tend to be in play at the same time, indeed to merge, in the practice of writers and genre theorists. As received from cultural tradition, genres are con structs, abstractions from sedimented forms. Insofar as the vital projects that once mobilized them are no longer effective but must be recon structed, they belong to what Merleau-Ponty calls "constituted" or "established" speech. Insofar as its project is still vital, a genre com prises a demand and a challenge to devise new modes of discourse—or what he calls "expressive" or "creative" speech.7 Lyotard will link onto Merleau-Ponty by criticizing the phenomenological-perceptual model, and by exchanging the (anthropomorphic) terminology of "expression" and "creation," first for "language games," and then for an ontology of phrases. He will call genres "modes of forgetting the nothingness or . . . the occurrence, [which] fill the void between phrases" (138). He will hold on to the opposition between expressive and established discourse, if not in those terms. "Art is not imitation, ... It is a process of expressing" ("Cézanne's Doubt" 17). Art is not expression; it is a process of experi menting, will be Lyotard's reply. The notion of art as a critical and experimental practice, at once questioning inherited forms and trying out new ones, is part of the debt to Merleau-Ponty. Lyotard hides neither the debt nor the différend. Cézanne avoided "ready-made alternatives" and preferred "to search for the true meaning of painting, which is always to question tradition," notes Merleau-Ponty (13). The formulation becomes canonical in Lyotard: "When Cézanne picks up his paint brush, what is at stake in painting is put into question." In this passage, the stakes of genres are not seen as arriving ready-made, affixed to genres, but are presented as being themselves in dispute: "Not only are new strategies for 'gaining' tried out, but the nature of the 'success' is questioned." Ultimately, the stakes of painting, music and literature will be "analogous ... to those that orient the philosophical genre" (Dif férend 139). For each of these genres, it will be a matter of inventing new modes of linking, new idioms, in order to "bear witness" to différends (xiii). 64 Spring 1991</page><page sequence="4">Kauffmann What is Lyotard's "strategy" for engaging the "canonical phrases" of Montaigne, Adorno, and others concerning the ends of the essay? Admittedly, the question is itself an "impertinent" linkage, not author ized by The Différend, according to which "you don't play around with language," and genres are "strategies—of no-one" (137). Lyotard does not link onto Adorno's phrasing of the essay's stakes by devising a full blown alternative theory of the genre to trump Adorno's. He does respond—parodically—to Adorno's negative dialectics.8 But to write a "sequel" to Adorno's "Der Essay als Form" would be to fix the stakes of the genre "once and for all," to "transcribe" or "imprint" his own theoretical "ends" onto the genre, giving it a final rule; whereas the only "rule" he ascribes to the essay is that of philosophical discourse itself, which "has as its rule to discover its rule: its a priori is what it has at stake" (60). Hence the paradox of the essay (and of philosophical dis course), that its only "rule" is that of indeterminacy with respect to its own ends. Its destiny or "finality" is to be always looking for its rule, but never to find it (or to do so only at the cost of ceasing to be): One always "begins" by phrasing without knowing if what one phrases is legitimate. For, as long as the rule is what is at stake in the discourse, then the rule is not the rule of that dis course, and the discourse makes links any way it can, it tries itself out [il s'essaie]. And when the rule is "identified" as the rule of the genre one was trying out, what is at stake in that genre ceases to be its rule, and the genre ceases to be an essay or a critique (Différend 97). It is almost as though Picasso's boast, je ne cherche pas, je trouve, were to be reversed and rewritten as a generic injunction: seek, but do not find. Next to the "teleologies of fulfillment" and "melancholia for the unfulfilled," a teleology of unfulfillmenf! (see Différend 80). The essay's indeterminacy is noted, but interpreted differently, by Merleau-Ponty, when he speaks of Montaigne's writings as a "hunt without a kill," or an "inquiry without discovery" (202). II. Instead of offering a full-blown theory of the essay to counter Adorno's, Lyotard redefines the stakes of genres, including the essay. He does so, first of all, by experimenting—both with modes of linkage and with generic ends themselves. His field of experimentation includes: philosophical essay, dissertation, "instruction," report, dialogue, frag Vol. XXXI, No. 1 65</page><page sequence="5">L'Esprit Créateur ment, récit, travel narrative, lecture, intervention, tombeau, commen tary, review, memoir, causerie, and political critique. Each of his experi ments tests the rules, boundaries, and stakes of genres and their phrase regimens. Given that diversity, it may seem odd to ask whether his writ ings may be said in any sense to follow a single generic principle or rule. Lyotard's explicit rejection of hegemonic genres would seem to rule out such a hypothesis: "There is no genre whose hegemony over the others would be just" (.Différend 158). If such a generic principle were nonethe less to be found operative in his writings, it would have to be one with respect for justice, heterogeneity, and indeterminacy of ends built into its regime. Let us listen to some of these experiments. My commentary must acknowledge in advance the inevitable "wrong" that will be done to the texts discussed. Its diachronic format merits Lyotard's skepticism toward narrative. Such discourse risks forgetting différends, hetero geneity, the "abysses" between phrases; narrative " 'swallows up' the event" (Différend 152). My intent is to give a sense of the diversity of generic ends attributed by Lyotard to his own projects. In Economie libidinale (1974),9 Lyotard denounces "critique" for being too pious and religious in its negativity, and calls instead for an affirmative, "pagan" mode of discourse, one displaying an "atheism of the libidinal band" (15). The theoretical text is described as a libidinal apparatus, "an immobilized organic body" producing effects of unity and totality in its own discourse.10 That texts can be bodies, and bodies texts, "can trouble none but silly materialists," claims Lyotard, "and proves that everything is material for the libido." The pleasure of theory is based on mimetic repetition: its "tautologous perfection induces the enthusiasm of faithfulness in replication." The "organic theoretical body" is a "good and proper form," a closed "system of utterances" derivable from its axioms and implying the denial of disparities, hetero geneities, and polymorphous libidinal intensities. To counter theory's frozen mimesis—which Lyotard traces to the Freudian "death-instinct" (Todestrieb)—he calls, not for "anti-theory," but for a "discourse of dissimulation" at the very heart of theory. Such discourse would not aim to get more power, but to divest itself of power, and to become "bodies" that would be good conductors of unpredictable intensities and effects, following no "law of concatenation," "final word," or other "guaran tees." It would be, writes Lyotard, "neither a Treatise, as in the (Neo-) Classical Age, nor even an Essay or Enquiry as advanced by Montaigne 66 Spring 1991</page><page sequence="6">Kauffmann or Hume: not only will this discourse not be the treatment of a definite object, it will not even be the search for this object, nor the search for a statement suitable to its purpose" (116-22). This discourse of dissimula tion searches for nothing, finally, but "anonymous singularities" (.Economie libidinale 307). Lyotard does not call for "anti-theoretical theory," which would marginalize intensities by locating them in a specialized (anti-theoretical) genre: "There is no special place for inten sities, no such thing as the intense genre. . ." ("Pseudo-Theory" 125). He comments on the genre of Economie libidinale: "The present writing would not be a book, but miscellaneous pieces . . . only bundles ... of libido..." (123). In this provocative work, Lyotard eschews the totality and homogeneity to which traditional theory, in his view, unjustifiably lays claim. Lyotard's attentiveness to genre is equally evident in Rudiments païens: genre dissertatif (1977),11 a collection that continues his project for inventing an impious, "pagan" way of doing theory. Lyotard announces at the outset that "it is time to interrupt theoretical terror. . . . [t]he desire for truth, which feeds terrorism everywhere. . . ." It is not a question of inventing new theories or interpretations, but of some thing more radical: "what we lack is a devilry [diablerie] or an apathy such that the theoretical genre itself be subverted. . . ; that it good and well become once more a genre and be dislodged from the position of mastery and domination which it has occupied at least since Plato; that truth become an affair of style" (pp. 9-10; my emphasis). From "One of the Things at Stake in Women's Struggles" (1978)12 we get a dramatic sense of the philosophical and political stakes of genre for Lyotard—this time with reference to gender (both meanings, genre and gender, covered by the French "genre"): "It may be that you are forced to be a man from the moment that you write. . . . Even if you write as a woman, 'femininely.' Perhaps what we call feminine writing is only a variation on a genre that is masculine and remains so: the essay." What is at stake, not only in women's struggles but at the heart of philos ophy, is the question of metalanguage, which makes of the philosopher, according to Lyotard, "a secret accomplice of the phallocrat. For philos ophy is not just any discipline. It is a search for a constituting order that gives meaning to the world, society, and discourse." What matters, he continues, is that the question of gender opposition, and the possibility of an answer, can be posed "only in the metalanguage... of philosophy. For such a metalanguage is already the language of masculinity in the Vol. XXXI, No. 1 67</page><page sequence="7">L'Esprit Créateur western, and particularly Greek, sense" (118-19). Small wonder that the rejection of metalanguage will be an integral premise in Lyotard's subse quent formulations of the "rules" of both (heretofore "masculine") genres, essay and philosophy (see Différend 158). Lyotard's work of the late seventies and early eighties further compli cates the stakes of both genres by tying them to the question of post modernity. In "Answering the Question: What is Postmodernism?" (1982),13 Lyotard asks how art and philosophy ought to respond to the contemporary situation of knowledge. He defines the postmodern condi tion as a loss of faith in "metanarratives of emancipation," combined with the general "flight from reality" that accompanies modernity from its inception, and that is intensified with each scientific "revolution" (Copernican, Industrial, Cybernetic...). As against those who, in a reac tionary spirit, demand artistic and philosophical works that would restore a comforting sense of reality and unity of experience, Lyotard sides with avant-garde art and its restless experimentation, its quest tor new rules, new effects, and creative instabilities—a spirit he finds to be operative in advanced scientific research as well. Having posited that modernity in general is characterized by a "withdrawal of the real," Lyotard appeals to Kant's analysis of the sublime to draw a distinction between the "modern" and the "postmodern" as two modes of response to that vanishing sense of reality. The dynamic of the sublime in Kant was premised on an asymmetry between the faculties of reason, under standing and imagination, such that there results an inevitable dis crepancy between what human beings can conceive and what they can present or instantiate—between the conceivable and the presentable. Lyotard defines and defends the postmodern as "that which, in the modern, puts forward the unpresentable in presentation itself." Denying itself the ("modern") consolations of good form and consensus of taste based on "nostalgia for the unattainable," the "postmodern" for Lyotard would be that which searches for new presentations, not in order to enjoy them but in order to impart a stronger sense of the unpresentable. A postmodern artist or writer is in the position of a philosopher: the text he writes, the work he produces, are not in principle governed by pre established rules, and they cannot be judged according to a determining judgment, by applying familiar categories to the text or to the work. Those rules and categories are what the work of art itself is looking for. Then he adds, almost as a throwaway, "It seems to me that the essay 68 Spring 1991</page><page sequence="8">Kauffmann (Montaigne) is postmodern, while the fragment (The Athaeneum) is modern" (81). Countering nostalgic appeals to consensus, realism, or unity of experience, the business of the postmodern writer or artist is, in Lyotard's words, "not to supply reality but to invent allusions to the conceivable which cannot be presented." He concludes by calling for "a war on totality; let us be witnesses to the unpresentable ... let us activate the differences and save the honor of the name" (82)—thus invoking no longer the anonymous singularities of Economie libidinale, but singulari ties, nonetheless. In another text from the same period, "Philosophy and Painting in the Age of their Experimentation: Contribution to an Idea of Post modernity" (1981),14 Lyotard continues to expand the functions pre viously associated with the essay. This important statement sketches a poetics for the postmodern essay. Addressing the question of genre in the contemporary arts and their commentary, he holds that their common task "consists in exploring things unsayable, and things invisible." "What do we want of art today? Well, for it to experiment, to stop being only modern. By saying this, we're experimenting. And what do we want of philosophy? For it to analyze these experimentations by means of reflexive experimentations" (193). Lyotard places the essay on the side of avant-garde aesthetics and of satire, renouncing romantic or "modern" nostalgia for Being, meaning, unity of experience, classical aesthetics or "speculative metaphysics," and seeking instead, through reversibility, metamorphic shifts, and experimentations, to try out new aesthetic and social possibilities, to become "answerable to an ontology and a politics that are satirical." Lyotard acknowledges his debts to Merleau-Ponty, Benjamin and Adorno, each of whom anticipated aspects of postmodern aesthetics. He also points out how each—whether by remaining "mono theistic" (Merleau-Ponty) or too "modern" (Benjamin, Adorno: their residual "passion of meaning" betraying nostalgia for a subject)—failed to realize the sociocritical, avantgardistic functions (those of a "general ized satire") required of a postmodern essay. Lyotard reactualizes the sense of risk and experimentation that was always part of the essay's semantic heritage, while generalizing the stakes of the genre to encom pass virtually the entire cultural field. "Experiments are made. This is our postmodernity's entire vocation, and commentary has infinite possi bilities open to it" (190-93). The Différend (1983) takes its place among these experiments, first and most evidently, as a new form of presentation: that of numbered Vol. XXXI, No. 1 69</page><page sequence="9">L'Esprit Créateur fragments with interspersed reading "notices" on classical philosophical texts. A new form, one should specify, for Lyotard. The numbered frag ments and laconic style of these thought experiments recall Wittgen stein's Philosophical Investigations, while certain texts of Nietzsche and Adorno are evident influences as well. The title of the book, glossed in the remarkable "Preface: Reading Dossier," announces the thesis echoed at various levels (structural, modal, graphic, thematic, syntactical) of the work: "that a universal rule of judgment between heterogeneous genres is lacking in general" (xi). The rhetorical stakes of the genre: "To convince the reader (including the first one, the A.) that thought, cogni tion, ethics, politics, history or being, depending on the case, are in play when one phrase is linked onto another" (xii-xiii). This theme is carried over to the work's genre: "In the sense of poetics, the genre is that of Observations, Remarks, Thoughts, and Notes which are relative to an object; in other words, a discontinuous form of the Essay" (xiv). Is The Différend an essay, as the author suggests? To accept his apparently straightforward genre description at face value would be paradoxical, given his insistence on the contingency of linkage between phrases. With its cross-referenced, numbered fragments, this text looks less like a con ventional essay than most of Lyotard's previous writings. Moreover, to answer too quickly in the affirmative would ignore an alternative implied in Lyotard's initial phrase, "In the sense of poetics. . . ." Is one to infer another sense in which the book is not an essay? Could it be the sense in which it is less an essay than a "book"—books being subject in part to the "finalities" of philosophy's twin adversaries: the academic and the economic genres (xiii, xv)? Or (less trivially) the sense in which it is a complex philosophical work—the outcome of discipline and method spanning a decade (xv)? Its genesis and rhythm, its askêsis, are not those of a coup d'essai. "Poetics," moreover, is apt to employ generic cate gories as taxonomic devices—retrospectively, as Lyotard uses the term "Essay" here, to identify a closed text or corpus—thus positing rules and linkages whose necessity and consistency may not (according to the book's thesis, must not) have been so clearly determined in the act of writing. Each act of phrasing necessarily gives rise to différends, we are told, because only one of the various possible linkages is actualizable at a given time in a given context. A phrase that comes along is put into play within a conflict between genres of discourse. . . . The multiplicity of stakes, on a par with the multiplicity of genres, turns every linkage 70 Spring 1991</page><page sequence="10">Kauffmann into a kind of "victory" of one of them over the others. These others remain neglected, for gotten, or repressed possibilities. There is no need to adduce some will or intention to describe that. It suffices to pay attention to this: there is only one phrase "at a time." (136) If The Différend is an essay, it is only so in a new sense inaugurated by that work. Is it "successful" on its own terms? According to the criterion set down in that work, a painting (whose stakes are said to be "analogous ... to those that orient the 'philosophical' genre") will be "good (will have realized its ends, come near them) if it obliges the addressee to ask what it consists in" (Diff. 139). That is, of course, the question with which this essay began. Lyotard's statements on the essay suggest the multiple and changing stakes of that genre. From his renunciation of the essay in Economie libidinale to his open adoption of the form in The Différend, the ends of the essay undergo gradual reformulation and expansion, its rhetorical stakes becoming almost equal to the stakes of postmodern art and philos ophy. The mutation of genres and ends in Lyotard attests to a sveltesse and a "metamorphic capacity" of his writing—qualities that he recom mends as being apt for resisting capital's universal criterion of "per formativity."15 Genre experiments are his way of judging without cri teria, of respecting the contingency of linkage, and of thereby remaining faithful to différends, events, and singularities. III. In "The Sign of History" (1982),16 Lyotard takes as the Begebenheit or sign of the times a certain "fission" that sunders the unity of the "great discourses of modernity." Can it be accidental that the essay is not listed among the genres or "ways of proceeding" of philosophical discourse that "seem to the philosopher to damp the echo of this fission with the deafness of established forms?" If the essay is conspicuously absent from his list, is it not because, unlike those forms, it does not have specific "rules for the formation and linking of phrases and ... for the presentation of objects (examples) which can validate their phrases"? An absence that obliges the essayist, like the philosopher, "to judge without any criterion (in the absence of established rules)" (163). For Lyotard, the times call for an essay, rather than for a system, from philosophers ("Philosophy and Painting" 181-82). So much was already argued (or witnessed) by, inter alia, Bloch, Benjamin, and Adorno. But Lyotard Vol. XXXI, No. 1 71</page><page sequence="11">L'Esprit Créateur will add: and for "a philosophy of phrases rather than for a philosophy of the faculties of a subject" ("Sign" 180). "No need to adduce some will or intention to describe that. ..." This marks the real stakes of Lyotard's experiment in The Différend, setting the "ends" of the genre as mandated by the times. The critical separation of the faculties by Kant, and the "disentanglement" of language games by Wittgenstein, laid the groundwork for the "thought of dispersion (diaspora, writes Kant). . . which, according to the A[uthor], shapes our context." Now their "legacy" is to be disencumbered of its debt to "anthropomorphism . . . transcendental in Kant, empirical in Wittgen stein" (xiii). This task entails a paradigm shift: "In the matter of lan guage, the revolution of relativity and quantum theory remains to be made" (137). Lyotard is urging in effect that the "crisis of the subject" in modern thought since Kant be taken seriously, that the critique of the subject be accepted as the "situation of thought today." He stated the challenge simply in an interview: "Can we think without the subject?'"7 Lyotard notes and assumes the paradox inherent in phrasing with the Kantian idiom: the language of the "faculties" implies a subject (Dif férend 61-62). If Lyotard does not resolve but maintains the aporia that there could be generic aims and strategies without a subject, the persis tence of that aporia may not simply be cited as an argument against The Différend. If his diagnosis is correct, the aporia is no mere dialectical construct, but the condition of contemporary thought. The stakes of the philosophical essay are redefined accordingly. This aporia is also the site of his "différend" with Adorno regarding the ends of the essay (a différend requiring the careful articulation, impossible here, of their many affinities).18 Both thinkers recognize the dissolution of "experience" as conceived under humanism; the difference hinges on whether that is to be counted a loss or a gain, and on how to respond. Both renounce transcendental pretensions to totality or identity; both recognize the essay as a discontinuous form and an "art of transition" that resists mere "communication" and the "rules" of traditional dis cursive thought; a form whose object would be—to go on with Adorno's phrasing for a moment—"the new as something genuinely new, as some thing not translatable back into the staleness of already existing forms" ("Essay as Form" 169). These affinities will suffice to show that Lyotard is phrasing the ends of the essay not only "after" Merleau-Ponty but also after Adorno (who phrased after Benjamin...)- They also confirm the authenticity of what is 72 Spring 1991</page><page sequence="12">Kauffmann at stake in Lyotard's experiments on the essay. The role and place of the subject—and its formal correlative, the question of discursive transitions —were also the stakes between Benjamin and Adorno in their correspon dence of the thirties. Where Lyotard parts company with Adorno is over the latter's nostalgic (or tenacious) hold on the philosophy of the subject, which he inherits from idealist philosophies of consciousness—and over Adorno's nostalgic "modernist" aesthetics, to which Lyotard opposes his own postmodern aesthetics of the sublime. The ends that Adorno will transcribe onto the genre—the essay as the resistance of the negative, and as Utopian rescue of an attenuated subject—will fall under Lyotard's critique in several ways. Adorno's is no naive affirmation of the subject. The essay in his terms eschews standpoints and "tends toward the liquid ation of opinion [Meinung], including its own" (166). There is, however, what Lyotard would call a hegemony of the cognitive phrase in Adorno's subordination of the aesthetic to the conceptual moment of the essay: "If the essay struggles aesthetically ... it is obeying an epistemological motive" (164). And his appeal to the categories of individual experience and consciousness—albeit "mediated by the all-encompassing experience of historical humanity" (158)—incur Lyotard's corrosive analysis. "The category of the human subject remains uncriticized. ... It is the nucleus not only of the interpretation of society as alienation and of art as its martyred witness, but of all theory of expression" ("Adorno as Devil" 127-28). Where Lyotard goes beyond Adorno incontestably is not on the level of argumentation, but on another level. Adorno does not risk or revise his positions; he elaborates. He does not experiment with or put his own ends back into play, as Lyotard often does. Lyotard's experiments are at once affirmative and critical, trying out linkages, but also breaking through the old ones. Lyotard is the better experimenter, showing greater "metamorphic" capacity. Keeping his own ends in play, he exacerbates gaps and aporias, even those that threaten his positions. He answers nostalgia with pagan laughter. Lyotard's philosophy is, as he would wish, "popular, humorous" (Diff. 144, 158). "Victory" for Lyotard. This différend is too complex and too important to be resolved quick ly at the end of an essay. To do so would be to leave the "philosophic mode" and to enter a mode—"theoretical" or "speculative"—which would pretend to "settle" such matters {Diff. xiv). So for now I will stay with interrogative phrases. Can one really be finished with the question of the human subject? This is the underlying question of Lyotard's dif Vol. XXXI, No. 1 73</page><page sequence="13">L'Esprit Créateur ferend, not only with Adorno, but also with Merleau-Ponty. To put it another way: can the critique of the subject, which Lyotard takes as the situation of thought today, be accepted as such a horizon, without its turning into a sedimented thought, an instance of "established speech," an absolute presupposition that needs to be challenged? Precisely to the extent that it becomes a normal paradigm or background assumption, the thinker, the essayist, the experimenter would seem obliged to reopen the matter, to broach the question anew. Nor is it a matter of resurrect ing a particular form of humanity or constituting subject. "As the author is for Valéry the impostor of the writer, constituting consciousness is the philosopher's professional impostor.'"9 Lyotard is determined—by inclination and by the times—to eschew all impostor subjects. Can one dismiss the philosopher qua thinking subject, however, without also eclipsing his "shadow"—the "unthought" dimension that one does not get away from, and that conditions thought whether it is thematized or not? To proscribe as a metaphysical illusion any talk of the human sub ject, consciousness, will or intention—isn't that to close off some possi ble linkages and phrases by laying down a rule for judgment: namely, that the human subject may not legitimately be situated on the "referent" instance, or serve as an object of reflection? Castoriadis wrote: "One cannot think the being of language without thinking the being of the thinking subject."20 The Différend is one reply. For us it remains an open question. Might there still be a way of phrasing the human which would not entail nostalgia or illusion but honest experiments, in keeping with those of Montaigne? The stakes for Montaigne—like Cézanne, "never at the center of himself"—were scarcely those of coming to an end, or an answer, in the matter. "So there cannot in all good conscience be any question of solving the human problem; there can only be a question of describing man as problematic. Hence this idea of an inquiry without dis covery, a hunt without a kill. . ("Reading Montaigne" 202). The project there, what Merleau-Ponty calls Montaigne's "movement," was not toward self-possession or "absolute understanding," but toward "thought in act, as the only possible thought." When Montaigne turns to the "ambiguous self" as an object of reflection, ". . . it is a question addressed to the opaque being he is and awaits a response from. It is like 'essaying' or 'experimenting' on himself" (199). Far from being obsolete experiments, are these not the questions that still supply the impetus and half the stakes, and thus the continuity of the genre—what continuity 74 Spring 1991</page><page sequence="14">Kauffmann there is—from his time to ours, whatever time that turns out to be? Lyotard knows these "canonical" sentences. Perhaps that is why, at the risk of self-contradiction, he has not stopped phrasing the human. Now he phrases it as a différend between the "human" and (in its two modes) the "inhuman."21 That he continues to experiment, and some times to contradict himself, to write "after" his previous works, without concern to maintain doctrinal consistency—a trait he admires in Witt genstein22—is the best evidence of his fidelity to what is continuous in the ends of the essay. Montaigne's restless motion is Lyotard's motion, too. If, now, suspending for a moment the necessary caveats raised earlier, the essay were to be considered the "definitive" genre of Lyotard's writ ings, it would be less "in the sense of poetics" than in the paradoxical sense enacted by his own work: the essay as ceaseless questioning, as per manent experimentation.
