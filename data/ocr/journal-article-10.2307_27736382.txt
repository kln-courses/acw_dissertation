Cornutus and Allegorical Mythology: the 'Etci?qouii In the first century AD, the Roman philosopher and grammarian Annaeus Cornutus wrote, in Greek, a manual of allegorical mythology, entitled A Sur vey of the Theological Traditions of the Greeks CE7ii8pouTi T^&gt;v Korea xr\v 'EMtnviicriv GeoXoyiav Ttapa?e?oji?vcov).^ In this work, which has a didactic purpose, Cor nutus makes a survey of the principal gods of Greece, for the benefit of a young disciple from Rome. By means of more-or-less imaginative etymolo gies, Cornutus attempts to decipher the allegorical meanings that are hidden in myths, following a theory that he shares with a good number of Stoic thinkers.2) What we discover is that in the immense majority of cases within the 'E7ti8pour|, the interpretations of the gods are made in a physicalist vein. This is the way in which the figure of Zeus is studied, on whom Cornutus focuses in the second chapter of his work: cocmep ?? rpei? xmb yoxi?? ?ioiKouueBa, orneo Kai ? koouo? \|ruxnv e%ei xfiv ouvexouoav a?x?v, Kai avvi\ Kata?xai Ze\)?, 7ipcoxco?

ND 2.3.3-6) In the opinion of Cornutus and the ancient allegorists, a single name may be open to several distinct allegorical interpretations, without implying mutual exclusivity among them. Therefore, after saying that Zeus is the living soul of the cosmos, Cornutus adds a new explanation, according to which the supreme god is the cause par excellence. The first interpretation was based on the nominative of the name of Zeus; in the second case, Cornutus derives his interpretation from the *} This work forms part of the research project "Graecia capta.

(Corn. ND 2.3.8-9) 2. Aeo? in Cornutus: A Dialectal Form? I would like to draw attention to the third explanation of the meaning of Zeus s name proposed by Cornutus. After describing Zeus as cause, the author states the following: jcapa ?? tigi Kai Ae?? X?yexai, x?%a ano xov deveiv xr\v yfjv r\ u?xa?i?ovai xo?? ?cogi ?cotncfi? iKua?o?. (Corn. ND 2.3.10-1) It should be noted that, in order to pass from the theonym to the notion of wet ness, Cornutus has to change the name of the god, which ceases to be the habitual Zevq in order to become Aeu?, a form which is clearly relatable to Se\)(0 (wet, drench', according to LSf). If we look up Aeu? in this lexicon, we see that it informs us that Aeu? is the Boeotian variant of Zr?c, and is a variant which is testified to in such literary sources as Aristophanes, Corinna and the grammarian Herodian; in inscriptions, this form is also found in the Laconian and Rhodian dialects. It is also found in Corinthian, although this dialectal cognate is not found in LSf.4) LSf expressly references the passage in the second chapter of Cornutus in the entry for Ae?c. Since all other references to Aet&gt;? proposed by this work have a dialectal character, it can be assumed that LSf interpret Cornutus as relying on a dialectal, probably Boeotian, variant in the analyzed passage. Such an explana tion is theoretically possible. However, I see difficulties with this position; in addition, it is neither the only nor the best explanation which can be proposed for this form. 3. Plausibility of the Hypothesis An initial theoretical difficulty which has to be faced by those who believe that Cornutus is employing a dialectal variant involves the manner by which Cornutus would have been able, in the first century AD, to have knowledge of such an unusual dialectal form as Aeu?, Boeotian or not. A priori, it does not seem very 3) A?a and ?ia are already seen as related in PI. Cra. 396a. 4) Cf. Schwyzer41968, 91, 331, 414, 576.</page><page sequence="3">630 Miscelknea I f.B. Torres I Mnemosyne 62 (2009) 628-634 likely that Cornutus, a Roman author living in Rome, would have been able to have discovered the form through directly reading Greek inscriptions. Could he have discovered this variant of Zeu? through reading the available literature? (1) The Boeotian form of the theonym, Aevq, is attested for the first time (within the literary texts we still conserve) in Ar. Ach. 910-1, on the lips of a char acter who is imitating the speech of Boeotia: xcoS' ?ucc / 0ei?a0?v, ?xxco ?erj?. We do not know whether Aristophanes was present in Cornutus's library. But it is not necessary that he have read ?xxco Aev? in Aristophanes: it is a typical Boeotian expression, and was used as such by Plato in his Phaedo (62a8) in order to high light the speech style of Cebes, the Theban disciple of Socrates. However, it is equally certain that in the Platonic codices the form appears as ?xxco Ze\)?.5) (2) If the traditional dating of Corinna is correct (fifth century BC), the first appearance of Ae\)? in the literature would be that which we encounter in the frag ments of this poet: Aex&gt;q 7iaxei[p rc?vxco]v ?aotleuc (fr. 654 PMG, col. 3, v. 13). However, today^ it is generally thought that Corinna was a well-educated poet of the Hellenistic period who wrote imitating the Boeotian dialectal variant. In either case, it is chronologically possible that Cornutus could have encountered ?eu? in Corinna. The question is rather whether our author would have been so interested in the archaically-written and strongly localist poetry of Corinna, to the point of reserving a place for her among his readings. (3) The grammarian Herodian also employs the form which we are analyzing: Ae\)? vito Boicoxcov ? Zr?c (1.400 Lentz). Given the chronology (we are dealing with an author of the second century AD) it is impossible that Cornutus would have been able to encounter the form ?eu? through Herodian. But the discussion should not focus on the person of Herodian, but rather on the literary genre which he represents, i.e. that of grammarians. While in the case of Aristophanes and Corinna there is a doubt as to whether Cornutus would have read them, in the case of the authors of grammatical writings all doubt disappears: it is perfectly understandable that the grammarian Cornutus might have encountered Aeu? via the lost works of the Greek grammarians writing prior to Herodian. In regard to this point, it should be remembered that the scholia Londinensia of Dionysius Thrax state: ? Ze?? ?tapcx xo?? Acxkcogi Ae?? ?iyexai (493 Hilgard). Finally, it should be noted that the lexicographer Hesychius (fifth century AD?) also cites this form: Ar?c/ Zeu? (2.421 Latte). 5) The substitution of Aetx; for Zevq in this Platonic passage is a conjecture formulated by W.A. Rennie in his commentary on the text of Aristophanes. Cf. Rennie 1909 (ad 911). 6) Since the publication of Lobel 1930.</page><page sequence="4">Miscelknea I J.B. Torres I Mnemosyne 62 (2009) 628-634 631 4. Difficulties for the Hypothesis: Dialectal Variants in the 'Em?ooy-'n? Under the previous point I concluded that it cannot be excluded that Cornutus could have encountered the Greek dialectal form Ae\&gt;? through the works of the grammarians: therefore, the hypothesis according to which Aeu? in the Survey is a dialectal variant is, at least, a plausible thesis. However, this apparently plausible hypothesis becomes more doubtful when we attend to a peculiarity of the 'ETti?pouTj: leaving aside for the moment the case of Ae\)?, the manual of Cornutus does not depend on dialectal variants in order to propose new interpretations of theonyms. It is certainly the case that Cornutus enriches his etymological game via recourse to alternative forms of the names he is discussing. He does so in the three following cases: (1) KotA,?Vcai 8e 'AiS-n? r\ oxi koc0' ?amov a?pax?c ?axiv, ?Oev Kai Siaipowce? Ai?nv a?x?v ?vou?Co\)oiv... (Corn. ND 5.5.2-4) (2) xa%a S' ei AOrvva?a, ?? oi nahxi?i xr?v Af}nvav etayov, ai?epovaia ?axiv. (Corn. ND 20.36.7-8) (3) Si? ?? x? urixpo? xp?rcov (pueiv xe Kai xp?cpetv rc?vxa Afiurjxpav oiovei yiyv uryc?pa ouaav r\ An&lt;x&gt; ur|x?pa xco Kai aurnv Kai x? etc' auxfj? ?cpGovco? ?ipe?o?ai xo?? ?vGpamoi? ?axe?aoai Kai Sa?vuaGai. (Corn. ND 28.52.9-13) However, neither Aiorjc nor A?nvaia (-r|) nor Ar|c? should be regarded properly as dialectalisms within Cornutus' text. Rather, they are easier explained as literary variants. A?Sn?, A0T|vair| and Anco are alternating forms corresponding to the epic literary norm, i.e. they are variants which are chosen within Homer, Hesiod or the Homeric Hymns according to the metric conditions of the dactylic hexameter and the necessities of composition.^ The case of AOrjvaia (the form in the text of the 'Erci?pouri, 20.36.7) is somewhat different, since this theonym could be either an atticized epicism (constructed upon A&amp;nvair|) or an Attic archaism (not a dialec talism!) which Cornutus could have read in Attic tragedy (cf. e.g. A Eu. 288). Thus, it can be assumed that Cornutus does not generally employ dialectal vari ants in his manual; if Ar?c were such a variant, it would be an unicum which would need justification. This reduces the plausibility of the hypothesis that Ae?c is a dialectal variant, and invites us to seek out an alternative explanation for the form. 7) Concerning Ai?n? and AOnva?ri, cf. the evidence collected in the LfgrE (ss.w. A0r|vair| and 'A??o?). Aric? is a hypochoristic of the name of Demeter, in relation to which the LfgrE (s.v.) refers to Richardson 1974, 167 (ad 47).</page><page sequence="5">632 Miscelknea I J.B. Torres I Mnemosyne 62 (2009) 628-634 5. An Alternative Hypothesis If we must abandon the thesis that Ae?c is a dialectal form in Cornutus, the most probable explanation is that we have encountered a Latinism, and that Ae?c is nothing other than the Latin word for god', deus.8) In regard to this interpreta tion, I would like to draw attention to the following three points: (1) Both the author and the recipient of the text in which the term under dis cussion appears are Romans. We know that the unidentified recipient is a Roman, because the work presupposes knowledge of Roman realities such as the Vestal Virgins and the custom of the triumph.9) On pronouncing, writing or hearing the Greek proper name Ae?c, both the author as well as the text's recipient would have to have had in mind the Latin common noun deus, independently of the fact that the Greek form is monosyllabic and the Latin form is bisyllabic: discrepancies of this sort are leveled in other parts of Cornutus's text.10) (2) The author indicates that the term Aet&gt;? is that which is used rcocp? xiat, among some'. The meaning of the expression is ambiguous, and it could be sup posed that it fits poorly with our hypothesis: if Ae\&gt;? (Greek) were really deus (Latin), we would expect that in place of rcocp? xigi the author would have stated more precisely rcocp' f]u?v (among us'), or else Ttcxpoc xo?? Tcoumoi? (among the Romans'). However, the difficulty can be overcome if we take into consideration the fact that Roman authors who write in Greek, such as Cornutus, are always very restrictive in their references to Rome, its cultural realities and literature.n) In my opinion, this consideration justifies Cornutus's use of an expression which to modern readers appears quite ambiguous (icapa xiat, among some') to refer to those who use Ar?c to name Zet)?. (3) It should be noted that, while Cornutus identifies Zeus with deus, he nev ertheless converts the anthropomorphic god of the Greeks into God in an absolute 8) As far as I know, this hypothesis was proposed for the first time by Hays (1983; cf. 135: "Deus: in both Doric and Latin"); but unfortunately he did not offer justification or further development for his suggestion. 9) In regard to the Vestal Virgins, cf. 28.52.14-7: TtapeiGayexa? te i] u?v 'EGT?a rcapO?vo? ?i? x? xrjv aKivnG?av jrnoev?c eivai yevvnxiKfiv?Kai xot&gt;xo\) %?piv Kai vito Tcap6?vcov vecoKope?xai.

This is coherent with the monotheistic attitude of this Stoic grammarian and philosopher, which can be seen throughout the Survey and which is also insin uated in Chapter 2, upon which I am basing my analysis: koci ?aoiA,e\)?iv ?

Two Positive Conclusions As a result of the preceding analysis, it appears possible to propose two positive conclusions: (1) The form Aet)? in Cornutus (ND 2.3.10-1) need not be taken as a dialectal variant, but rather should be seen as a Latinism to which the author recurs in order to enrich his allegorical interpretations of the name of Zeus.
