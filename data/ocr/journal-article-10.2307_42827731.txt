<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCHLEIERMACHER, SPINOZA, AND ELIOT: HERMENEUTICS AND BIBLICAL CRITICISM IN ADAM BEDE by ANDREW LYNN University of Glasgow In the mid-nineteenth-century, the problem of hermeneutics extended beyond the problems of literary and biblical interpretation; it concerned the very possibility of knowledge and understanding in general. This provoked what David Carroll describes as a 'crisis of interpretation', a desperate attempt to find 'that Victorian Holy Grail, a comprehensive synthetic philosophy'. As a polymath, Eliot was particularly suited to this task, Carroll claims, as each of her intellectual interests - biblical criticism, philosophy, biology - was concerned at a fundamental level with 'the problem of interpretation'.1 For Eliot, interpretation was more than a literary-critical act; it became an act of perceiving the depth or sense of totality in particulars, a kind of 'divination'. This process was at once an idea within her work, as well being a formative aesthetic principle, expressed through the 'organic' form of the novel. Reading, according to the model we are exploring, is seeing into the life of things.2 The paradigmatic metaphor for this hermeneutic quest is that of the circle, and I shall discuss this in relation to one of the founding fathers of hermeneutics, Friedrich Schleiermacher, whom it is probable that Eliot read.3 She would certainly have been aware of his ideas, ranging from his early Romanticism to his later hermeneutics, as these were intimately related to various ideas that were part of the intellectual cut and thrust of the mid-Victorian period. For Schleiermacher, understanding is an unending task, so the search for meaning, or what he terms the 'inner unity', is only to be achieved in an approximate and provisional sense. However, we can find a substitute for this sense of completeness that is sought; for Schleiermacher this is located in 'feeling':4 The sum total of religion is to feel that, in the highest unity, all that moves us in feeling is one; to feel that aught single 47</page><page sequence="2">and particular is only possible by means of this unity; to feel, that is to say, that our being and living is a being and living in and through God. But it is not necessary that the Deity should be presented as one distinct object.5 It appears that, for Schleiermacher, the concept of God is secondary to the essence of religious feeling. A cognitive relation to God is finite and objectifying, whereas feeling is directed towards a sympathy with the divine infinite. Certainly Schleiermacher seems to suggest this, when he stresses that religion is not knowledge and science, either of the world or of God. Without being knowledge, it recognises knowledge and science. It is itself an affection, a revelation of the Infinite in the finite, God being seen in it and it in God.6 Religion for Schleiermacher is not about ethics or metaphysics, or even, strictly speaking, theology. This invites an immediate comparison with Spinoza, whose Tractatus Theologico-Politicus established principles of biblical criticism that would inspire the later German 'higher' critics.7 Both Spinoza and Schleiermacher wrote within a tradition of immanent philosophy: each point in the infinite has an apprehension of the whole. There is no point, such as a transcendent God, outside the totality, and each point bears its own feeling or interpretation of the whole. Inspired by Spinoza's approach, if not by his rigorous philosophy of immanence, Schleiermacher radically historicised and demythologised the Scriptures in a manner akin to his revered predecessor.8 According to Schleiermacher, recognising the poetic nature of Scripture also means seeing beyond the literal 'vehicle' to the higher nature: The sacred writings were not for perfect believers alone, but rather for children in belief, for novices, for those who are standing at the entrance and would be invited in, and how could they go to work except as I am now doing with you. [...] As you can easily see, a communication of this sort could be nothing other than poetical or rhetorical. Akin to the rhetorical is the dialectic, and what method has from old been more brilliantly or more successfully employed in revealing the higher nature, not only of knowledge, but of the deeper feelings? But if the vehicle alone satisfies, this end will not be reached. Wherefore, as it has become so common 48</page><page sequence="3">to seek metaphysics and ethics chiefly, in the sacred writings, and to appraise them accordingly, it seems time to approach the matter from the other end, and to begin with the clear-cut distinction between our faith and your ethics and metaphysics, between our piety and what you call morality.9 As the founder of modern hermeneutics, Schleiermacher has the distinction of establishing a general philosophical hermeneutics, which at the same time freed theological hermeneutics from its ecclesiastical shackles.10 Hermeneutics now became concerned with the understanding not only of biblical texts, but about all texts; indeed, about the 'art' of understanding anything at all.11 It goes without saying that the Bible would now be read as any other text; that is, using general hermeneutical principles rather than narrow biblical exegesis.12 Understanding became 'a dynamic process' between the universal and the subjective, between 'comparison' and 'divination': that is, not only the comparison of authors and texts, but also an intuitive 'feeling' or 'divination' as to 'how language as a living thing has affected the fabric of thought and the mode of presentation'. And importantly for Schleiermacher, 'also necessary is some insight into the kind of person who writes in order to descry how qualities unique to the author shaped the production.'13 The problem which is immediately apparent is, as Schleiermacher himself says: 'One must already know a man in order to understand what he says, and yet one first becomes acquainted with him by what he says.'14 This is just one instance of the circular nature of all of our understanding, the classic hermeneutic circle: the apparent paradox that 'the whole is understood from the parts, so the parts can be understood only from the whole'. This principle is central to Schleiermacher's thought, and the consequence of this paradox is that a text can never be understood completely: 'understanding is an unending task.'15 The 'art' of hermeneutics requires agility, an ability to weave from the grammatical to psychological side and from the comparative to divinatory method. Furthermore, interpretation involves constant movement back and forth, for it is always open to revision and supplementation. Since the life of the language and the life of the person form an infinite horizon, perfect 49</page><page sequence="4">understanding is an ideal ever approximated but never attained.16 In his ground-breaking work, Aesthetics and Subjectivity from Kant to Nietzsche , Andrew Bowie makes a careful study of the relationship between Schleiermacher's Hermeneutics and Critique and the Aesthetics . He argues that the term 'divination', which as we have seen in the above example is the counterpoint to the 'comparative', has been wrongly taken to mean Einfiihlung, or "'feeling one's way into" another person's thought via their writings'. This has resulted in a 'psychologist' interpretation of 'divination', which Schleiermacher did not intend, and which is an absurdity anyway because Schleiermacher never used the term Einfiihlung in the first place.17 By making the term personal and psychological in this way, we fail to see how divination, immanence, and interpretation are entwined. Divination is not just a human activity of reading Scripture, and reading is part of a general hermeneutic activity of life as such: from each point in the infinite we can read some apprehension of the whole. Schleiermacher's formulation of the aesthetic act of 'divination' implies 'production' and 'creation' ( Erzeugung ), and far from being a 'mystical act of identification' with another author or speaker, is actually part of immediate self- consciousness itself. Thus the 'art' of divination is 'a necessary component of our everyday, and always incomplete praxis of understanding each other and the world.'18 The apparent paradox of subjectivity and meaning is central to George Eliot's work, and perhaps especially Adam Bede, whose central characters, Dinah and Hetty, dramatise this search for a coherent world view. In many ways all the other characters in the novel try to understand or assimilate or indeed synthesise the 'extremes' represented by Dinah and Hetty.19 David Carroll points out that the very language of Adam Bede - that of 'optics, perspective, focus' - already makes the problem of hermeneutics the central one in the novel.20 Hetty and Dinah are unable to grasp each other's meaning, and the narrator is in no doubt that the blame should be shared equally, and that Dinah, for all her 'divinity', has yet to learn the 'art' of divination: It is our habit to say that while the lower nature can never understand the higher, the higher nature commands a 50</page><page sequence="5">complete view of the lower. But I think the higher nature has to learn this comprehension, as we learn the art of vision, by a good deal of hard experience, often with bruises and gashes incurred in taking things up by the wrong end, and fancying our space wider than it is.21 Stephen Prickett also reads the 'Two-Bed Chambers' scene in terms of Schleiermacher's hermeneutics, in his analysis of the 'typology' of Adam Bede. The open-endedness of interpretation, and the need for sympathetic 'divination', mean that while each girl's 'vision' is flawed, what becomes important, is the relationship between that vision and the unrepeatable context of the personal circumstances from which it arises. Both must be understood with sympathy and imagination - even though in the end judgement must be made. Seen thus this contrast between the two girls' acts of worship becomes one of the most subtle and penetrating hermeneutical exercises in Victorian fiction.22 This is an extremely helpful reading because it establishes the key issue here to be modalities of self-consciousness. Obviously, the bad model is Hetty's narcissistic variety. Her self-regard is purely aesthetic and personal: using Kant's terminology we might say that she suffers from a failure of the categories, treating herself as an external object than a self-detenxiining subject. Her self-love is directed to what she is, and she does not recognise herself as a relation to others. She has self-regard - an ability to look at her physical being - but no self-consciousness - a recognition of her subjectivity that would tie her to others: No eyelashes could be more beautiful than Hetty's, and now, while she walks with her pigeon-like stateliness along the room and looks down on her shoulders bordered by the old black lace, the dark fringe shows to perfection on her pink cheek. They are but dim ill-defined pictures that her narrow bit of an imagination can make of the future; but of every picture she is the central figure, in fine clothes (199). Conversely, Dinah's negation of the human world in favour of theological knowledge is just as limiting but in the other direction. Her 'divine' is elevated above this world, and she cannot 'accommodate' herself 51</page><page sequence="6">to the discovery that some of those cunningly-fashioned instruments we call human souls have only a very limited range of music, and will not vibrate in the least under a touch that fills others with tremendous rapture or quivering agony (141). Dinah's 'window' is just as much a self-deceiving mirror as Hetty's glass:23 She closed her eyes, that she might feel more intensely the presence of a Love and Sympathy deeper and more tender than was breathed from ¿he earth and sky. That was often Dinah's mode of praying in solitude. Simple to close her eyes, and feel herself enclosed by the Divine Presence; then gradually her fears, yearning anxieties for others, melted away like ice-crystals in a warm ocean. She had sat in this way perfectly still, with her hands crossed on her lap, and the pale light resting on her calm face, for at least ten minutes, when she was startled by a loud sound, apparently of something falling in Hetty's room. But like all sounds that fall on our ears in a state of abstraction, it had no distinct character, but was simply loud and startling, so she felt uncertain whether she had interpreted it rightly (202). Dinah cannot interpret the noises, and can only rely on opening the Bible at random to make the choice between her conflicting impulses. Her literal interpretation of the parable of Paul at Ephesus leads her totally to misjudge the situation and Hetty's needs.24 Dinah's advice to Hetty is too 'metaphysical' and 'anthropomorphic', telling her in vague terms that she may well be in trouble one day, the trouble that 'comes to us all in this life: we set our hearts on things which it isn't God's will for us to have, and then we go sorrowing. [...] And I desire for you, that while you are young you should seek for strength from your Heavenly Father, that you may have a support which will not fail you in the evil day' (205) Within both the Spinozist and Kantian traditions to which Schleiermacher responded, anthropomorphism was the failure to think of human life in anything other than atomised, personal units. Even God is just a separate elevated 'person', rather than an infinite 52</page><page sequence="7">divinity suffused through life. Dinah's anthropomorphic conceptions make her a flawed character, and contrary to received wisdom which suggests that she is the idealised vehicle for George Eliot's Feuerbachian religion of humanity, she actually receives very little narrative sympathy.25 Mrs Poyser, who stands midway between Dinah and Hetty, and who is, despite herself, fascinated by one (Hetty) and critical of the other (Dinah), comes closest to achieving some sort of synthesis.26 Mrs Poyser is a corrective to Hetty's materialism as well as Dinah's asceticism. She approaches the Bible Spinozistically:27 that is, by the spirit and not the letter of the text, and by the light of natural knowledge. For Spinoza: true religion, is Divinely inscribed in human hearts, that is, in the human mind, and that this is the true original of God's covenant, stamped with his own seal, namely, the idea of Himself, as it were, with the image of his Godhead.28 Mrs Poyser and Dinah engage in set-piece (and very one-sided) Socratic dialogues, where Dinah's interpretation of the Scriptures and spiritual life is seen to be contrary to logic, and against the spirit of the text, not to mention to feed her desire for martyrdom and social alienation: 'I never saw the like to you, Dinah', Mrs Poyser was saying, 'when you've once took anything into your head: there's no more moving you than the rooted tree. You may say what you like, but I don't believe that's religion: for what's the Sermon on the Mount about, as you're so fond o' reading to the boys, but doing what other folks 'ud have you do? But if it was anything unreasonable they wanted you to do, like taking your cloak off and giving it to 'em, or letting 'em slap you ï the face, I dare say you'd be ready enough: it's only when one 'ud have you do what's plain common-sense and good for yourself, as you're obstinate th' other way' (518). Schleiermacher's hermeneutics provided a way of tying everyday bible reading to the Spinozist critique of a religion that has become merely cognitive. Good interpretation is not just reading: it is an act of responsive self-transformation in relation to a spirit that exceeds one's self. Spinoza tells us in the Tractatus that the Divine Law has 'come down to us uncorrupted' and that this 53</page><page sequence="8">admits of no dispute. For from the Bible itself we learn, without the smallest difficulty or ambiguity, that its cardinal precept is: To love God above all things, and one's neighbour as one's self. This cannot be a spurious passage, nor due to a hasty or mistaken scribe, for if the Bible ever put forth a different doctrine it would have had to change the whole of its teaching, for this is the corner-stone of religion, without which the whole fabric would fall to the ground.29 Accordingly, Mrs Poyser doesn't require that the Bible as a whole be divinely inspired, relying on the standard books of the Anglican liturgy for moral guidance. In terms of the Tractatus, these books provide her with the fundamental moral precepts which ensure against the dissolution of society:30 'And all because you've got notions i' your head about religion more nor what's i' the Catechism and the Prayer- Book.' 'But not more than what's in the Bible, aunt,' said Dinah. 'Yes, and the Bible too for that matter,' Mrs Poyser rejoined, rather sharply; 'else why shouldn't them as know best what's in the Bible - the parsons and people as have got nothing to do but learn it - do the same as you do? But, for the matter o' that, if everybody was to do like you, the world must come to a standstill; for if everybody tried to do without house and home, and with poor eating and drinking, and was allays talking as we must despise the things o' the world, as you say, I should like to know where the pick o' the stock, and the corn, and the best new milk cheeses 'ud have to go? everybody 'ud be wanting bread made o' tail ends, and everybody 'ud be running after everybody else to preach to 'em, instead o' bringing up their families, and laying by against a bad harvest. It stands to sense as that can't be the right religion ' (my italics, 122). Adam shares with Mrs Poyser many Spinozistic assumptions. He uses the Bible just as any other text, 'as a holiday book, serving him for history, biography, and poetry', and from which to glean fundamental moral doctrines. This method is deemed far more effective than the literal interpretation of Dinah and Seth. Adam even 'enjoyed the freedom of occasionally differing from an Apocryphal 54</page><page sequence="9">writer' (542). 31 He shows that his approach to the Scriptures is every bit as rational and oriented towards this world as Mrs Poyser's: "'They that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of those that are weak, and not to please themselves/' There's a text wants no candle to show 't: it shines by its own light' (93). In fact, Adam's method is picked up by Lisbeth, who frequently holds theological discussions with Seth which parallel those of Mrs Poyser and Dinah: 'An' when the Bible's such a big book, an' thee canst read all thro 't, an' ha' the pick o' the texes, I canna think why thee dostna pick words as donna mean so much more nor they say. Adam doesna pick a that 'n; I can understan' the tex as he's allays a-sayin', "God helps them as helps theirsen s.'" 'Nay, mother,' said Seth, 'that's no text o' the Bible. It comes out of a book as Adam picked up at the stall at Treddles'on. It was wrote by a knowing man, but overworldly, I doubt. However, that saying's partly true; for the Bible tells us we must be workers together with God.' 'Well, how'm I to know? It sounds like a tex' (90). Again, this shows the importance of accepting other sources of knowledge and inspiration than that of the Bible; and this is because the Bible is already part of a larger web of meaning. This extension of meaning and divination beyond sacred texts is dramatised on a larger scale when Dinah marries Adam and gives up the preaching, thereby implicitly rejecting the Bible as the only source of guidance.32 Adam predicates his moral sense on the truths of mathematics: "There's nothing but what's bearable as long as a man can work,' he said to himself: 'the natur o' things doesn't change, though it seems as if one's own life was nothing but change. The square o' four is sixteen, and you must lengthen your lever in proportion to your weight, is as true when a man's miserable as when he's happy; and the best o' working is, it gives you a grip hold o' things outside your own lot' (160). Adam's demonstration of proportionality is similar to that in the Ethics , where Spinoza explains the three kinds of knowledge through the example of finding a fourth proportional. Adam demonstrates his grasp of this by virtue of the second kind of knowledge, referring to a universal rule based on 'the ground of a common property of 55</page><page sequence="10">proportionals', and not by the vagaries of the first kind of knowledge, with its 'confused, unorderly manner'; that is, 'cognition from vague experience'.33 But Adam clearly still has a lot to learn, even in terms of the Spinozistic model, because the third kind of knowledge which eludes him is 'capable of containing the claims of knowledge and feeling'.34 It is this quality that he is shown to be peculiarly lacking for most of the novel. This is seen particularly in relation to his father, whose narrative function seems to be to throw light on Adam's development, a transition from moral 'hardness' to a position which recognises the claims of sympathy and intersubjectivity.35 Indeed, it is only at the death of his father that he begins to learn the 'alphabet' of this language, through which he must first learn to recognise the 'inward suffering' of others:36 Whenever Adam was strongly convinced of any proposition, it took the form of a principle in his mind: it was a knowledge to be acted on, as much as the knowledge that damp will cause rust. Perhaps here lay the secret of the hardness he had accused himself of: he had too little fellow-feeling with the weakness that errs in spite of foreseen consequences. Without this fellow- feeling, how are we to get enough patience and charity towards our stumbling, falling companions in the long and changeful journey? And there is but one way in a which a strong determined soul can learn it - by getting his heart-strings bound by the weak and erring, so that he must share not only in the outward consequence of their error, but their inward suffering. That is a long and hard lesson, and Adam had at present only learnt the alphabet of it in his father's sudden death, which, by annihilating in an instant all that had stimulated his indignation, had sent a sudden rush of thought and memory over what had claimed his pity and tenderness (255-6). Adam is equally as deceived by Hetty as Arthur is, and although they typify different moral perspectives, both men are unable to understand Hetty or read the language of her soul, and equally fail to detect the narrowness of her imagination and her lack of moral and aesthetic sense. We are left in no doubt as to the difficulty of the hermeneutic process: After all, I believe the wisest of us must be beguiled in this way sometimes, and must think both better and worse of people than 56</page><page sequence="11">they deserve. Nature has her language, and she is not unveracious; but we don't know all the intricacies of her syntax just yet, and in a hasty reading we may happen to extract the very opposite of her real meaning. Long dark eyelashes, now: what could be more exquisite? I find it impossible not to expect some depth of soul behind a deep grey eye with a long dark eyelash, in spite of an experience which shows to me that they may go along with deceit, peculation, and stupidity. But if, in the reaction of disgust, I have betaken myself of a fishy eye, there is a surprising similarity of result. One begins to suspect at length that there is no direct correlation between eyelashes and morals; or else, that the eyelashes expresses the disposition of the fair one's grandmother, which is on the whole less important to us (198-9). Even though he is mistaken about Hetty's character, and his own love for her, there is something about Adam's 'aesthetic appreciation' of Hetty that 'enables him to see beyond her material reality to a higher order'.37 The narrator cannot describe this beauty, preferring to compare it to music: For the beauty of a lovely woman is like music: what can one say more? Beauty has an expression beyond and far above the one woman's soul that it clothes, as the words of genius have a wider meaning than the thought that prompted them (400). Adam, too, has 'no fine words into which he could put his feeling for Hetty' (400). The 'schism' between the concrete and the abstract, and the inability of language to bridge this gap thus 'emphasise the ineffability of the experience'. And it is Adam's inability to articulate these feelings, that brings him, paradoxically, closer to 'the truth of feeling'.38 This reinforces the sense in which interpretation, according to Schleiermacher's model, goes beyond text and language in the narrow sense. Reading is divination - seeing meaning and spirit beyond the letter - but this process extends into the ethical recognition of other persons of nature. The symbolic regeneration of Adam begins when he renounces his previous hardness, and agrees to go to the courthouse for Hetty's trial. Adam shares the bread and wine, the resonances of which are 57</page><page sequence="12">meant to be obvious, and finally begins to accept the claims of sympathy and intersubjectivity: 'Mr Massey/ he said at last, pushing the hair off his forehead, 'I'll go back with you. I'll go into court. It's cowardly of me to keep away. I'll stand by her - I'll own her - for all she's been deceitful. They oughtn't to cast her off - her own flesh and blood. We hand folks over to God's mercy, and show none ourselves. I used to be hard sometimes: I'll never be hard again. I'll go with you, Mr Massey - I'll go with you' (475). And this acceptance of his previous moral hardness is further reinforced by Adam's second meeting in the wood with Arthur. Adam is now able to master his emotions and commune with Arthur, but he also begins to learn the language of suffering: There was silence for several minutes, for the struggle in Adam's mind was not easily decided. Facile natures, whose emotions have little permanence, can hardly understand how much inward resistance he overcame before he rose from his seat and turned towards Arthur. Arthur heard the movement, and turning round, met the sad but softened look with which Adam said, 'It's true what you say, sir: I'm hard - it's in my nature. I was too hard with my father for doing wrong. I've been a bit hard to everybody but her. I felt as if nobody pitied her enough - her suffering cut into me so! and when I thought the folks at the Farm were too hard with her, I said I'd never be hard to anybody myself again' (514). Adam's sense of sorrow and suffering gradually transmute into submission and sympathy, and allow him to commune with Dinah - not however through theology or divine grace, but through imperceptible 'signs' of sympathy and intersubjectivity. These intuitive, unspeakable 'signs' demonstrate the incapacity of words, but paradoxically at the same time demonstrate the inescapability of narrative and the pressing need for human 'divination' and true understanding. This tentative way out of the 'infinite regress' of the hermeneutic circle has a 'musical' aspect, disrupting semantic logic, and demanding meaning not by a reference from sign to world, but 58</page><page sequence="13">by its own internal coherence and the ability of the aesthetic act to represent the unrepresentable:39 Those slight words and looks and touches are part of the soul's language; and the finest language, I believe, is chiefly made up of unimposing words, such as 'light', 'sound', 'stars', 'music' - words really not worth looking at, or hearing, in themselves, any more than 'chips' or 'sawdust': it is only that they happen to be signs of something unspeakably great and beautiful. I am of the opinion that love is a great and beautiful thing too; and if you agree with me, the smallest signs of it will not be chips and sawdust to you: they will rather be like those little words, 'light' and 'music', stirring the long-winding fibres of your memory, and enriching your present with your most precious past (537). Indeed, Adam's love for Dinah has 'a new sacredness' precisely because it had 'grown out of that past: it was the noon of that morning' (546). It is often overlooked that it is Adam who persuades Dinah to embrace community and to dismiss the competing claims of dogmatic theology. In the midst of Dinah's prevarication and struggle with the bondage of temptation, Adam's arguments - which the narrator and the reader know he could not have made at the 'start' of the narrative - centre on the claims of feeling and intersubjectivity: 'Yes, Dinah/ said Adam, sadly, 'I'll never be the man ť urge you against your conscience. But I can't give up hope that you may come to see different. I don't believe your loving me could shut up your heart; it's only adding to what you've been before, not taking away from it; for it seems to me it's the same with love and happiness as with sorrow - the more we know of it the better we can feel what other people's lives are or might be, and so we shall only be more tender to 'em, and wishful to help 'em. The more knowledge a man has the better he'll do 's work; and feeling's a sort of knowledge' (553). 40 Dinah, in considering Adam's arguments, now uses as her guide, not the Bible, but 'the ultimate guiding voice from within' (572). And as Adam waits for Dinah's decision, the narrator reminds us that the 59</page><page sequence="14">hermeneutic process is inextricably bound up with narrative, which shapes the future from an imaginative recasting of the past: But no story is the same to us after a lapse of time; or rather, we who read it are no longer the same interpreters; and Adam this morning brought with him new thoughts through that grey country - thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of the past (573). Adam's love for Dinah is different from his love for Hetty, because 'it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him through acquaintance with deep sorrow'. This 'higher feeling' is a sort of freedom, a 'liberty', which nonetheless demands selflessness and the awareness of the bonds of community and intersubjectivity. The imperatives of the narrative of his life make a return to his earlier narrowness and moral hardness impossible: The growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty, bringing with it a sense of added strength: we can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy, than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his crude manner, or a philosopher to his less complete formula (574). Adam now calls Dinah down from the mountain, ending her 'spiritual isolation' and drawing her 'into the human community of Hayslope'.41 That they should marry at the expense of Hetty and Arthur is not only artistically valid, but a narrative and ethical necessity. And far from being a contrivance, this episode can be seen to represent a partial (albeit provisional), reconciliation of the different world-views in the novel, as well as registering the suffering that lies uneasily and darkly with love and sympathy at the root of the hermeneutic quest. NOTES *David Carroll, George Eliot and the Conflict of Interpretations (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 2-3. I am much indebted to this excellent study. 2I paraphrase Wordsworth's 'Tintern Abbey', 1. 49. On the 2nd of November, 1851, George Eliot wrote to Sarah Hennell, asking her to send 'the MS translation of Schleiermacher's little book and also the book itself'. The George Eliot Letters , ed. 60</page><page sequence="15">Gordon Haight, 9 vols. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1954-78), 1, 157-58. Haight says in a note that he cannot identify the book 'with certainty'. The only works of Schleiermacher's that appear to have been translated into English before and during this time are the Brief Outline of the Study of Theology (Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1851), and Schleiermacher's Introductions to the Dialogues of Plato, translated by William Dobson (Cambridge, 1836). However, given that Eliot was only requesting an MS translation, and not a published translation, we may have to rule them out (reluctantly in the case of the Brief Outline, as it contains some hermeneutics). Otherwise, the book which immediately suggests itself is the famous On Religion : Speeches to its Cultured Despisers (1799), which appeared in numerous editions during the nineteenth century, but not in an English edition, although it is certainly possible that a translation of some sort was in circulation. Julia A. Lamm notes the importance of feeling ( Gefühl ) for Schleiermacher, and locates this in the fact 'that he was deeply troubled by the unbridgeable gap that Kant had established between freedom and desire, a gap that Schleiermacher interpreted as a further reification of the gulf between phenomena and noumena found in the Critique of Pure Reason '.

See The Divinity of Jesus Christ: A Study in the History of Christian Doctrine since Kant (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1938), p. 41. 7Eliot was profoundly influenced by Spinoza, and while her translation of the Ethics has been discussed by critics, her translation of the Tractatus - which has never been found - has been largely neglected. In his Biographical History of Philosophy (London, 1857), G. H. Lewes cites Schleiermacher's tribute to Spinoza: 'Offer up with me a 61</page><page sequence="16">lock of hair to the manes of the holy but repudiated Spinoza! [...] The great spirit of the world penetrated him; the Infinite was his beginning and his end; the universe his only and eternal love. He was filled with religion and religious feeling; and therefore it is that he stands alone, unapproachable; the master in his art, but elevated above the profane world, without adherents, and without citizenship' (p. 394). 9Schleiermacher, Speeches , p. 34. 10Werner Jeanrond, Theological Hermeneutics: Development and Significance (London: Macmillan, 1991), p. 44.
