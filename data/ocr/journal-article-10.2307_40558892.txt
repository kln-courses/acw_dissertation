HPHE inter-tropical South Pacific Ocean is studded with innumer- able islands which become larger and are set closer together towards the west. The Philippines and Papua consist of long moun- tain ranges with their flanks sloping to the sea. East of Papua are island groups which are in many cases the outstanding portions of submarine mountain chains, and the larger ones are, therefore, ^__^ &lt;=__ 145° 150° 155^ i6C£ 165^ &lt;=__ I | ^Orx new I I äi^i SeP !

The individual islands are often quite near one another, but sometimes the chains are, under present conditions, separated by a fair stretch of sea. The Solomon Islands are rather widely separated from the Santa Cruz group, and the Southern New Hebrides are some distance from the Loyalty Islands, but otherwise the distances are not such as to present grave difficulties to the canoe- voyagers, who have peopled these islands by maritime migrations that have also brought to the islands a varied assortment of arts and crafts, of custom and ritual. It is probable that in the days of their first peopling, the sea lay lower or the land stood higher, and that, therefore, migration from island to island was easier than it would be now for people with primitive equipment. The</page><page sequence="2">188 GEOGRAPHY. fact that some Melanesians in the mountainous interiors are very short is less indicative of a pygmy race than of the difficulties of a warm forest-environment. A native living inland may know but a narrow belt around his village and a few tortuous paths to the outer world. Arts and crafts may decline and disappear in these isolated groups, but canoe- voyages help to maintain and develop cultured tradition. Any decline of the art of canoe-building has, therefore, been a severe blow to standards of life. Beyond the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides eastwards the majority of the islands are smaller and lower, and the sea-spaces are far wider, so that much better equipment was needed by migrants to reach them than to reach the western ones. The latter are called Melanesia from the dark colouring of their people ; the islands farther out in the ocean, from their vast number, are collectively called Polynesia, while the name Mieronesia is often given to a few small ones on the north side of Polynesia in the vicinity of the equator. The Fiji Islands are volcanic mountain islands that are in several senses transitional between Melanesia and Polynesia. New Zealand, with a long mountain back- bone, is so remote from the other south Pacific islands that, as regards the life of its native people, it ranks with Polynesia and not with Melanesia, but there is a contrast here in that New Zealand lies in the temperate zone, and native life has undergone some important adaptational changes as a consequence of migration from inter- tropical to these cooler surroundings. In the western parts of Melanesia the sago -palm gives a great food supply, easily obtained by felling, grinding the pith, and washing out the starch. Coconut, banana, sugar-cane, and pineapple have been introduced, and tobacco has spread apparently from New Guinea. Several of these crops grow on the high islands of Melanesia, but not on the low ones of Polynesia. There are no important native mammals, so the native lacks leather, but abundant birds feed his cooking -pot and furnish feathers for head-dresses. There are crocodiles as far away from New Guinea as the Santa Cruz Islands. Fish are abundant, and the dugong is caught. As poisonous snakes and centipedes are absent from eastern Melanesia, the native has to fear very few animal dangers - -even the danger from sharks can easily be exaggerated ; but the mosquito, probably recently introduced, is a dreaded plague. Indonesian immigrants at some period have introduced the pig, which, however, has not reached New Caledonia. The pig serves as money and is related to many matters of ritual. The dog is another introduction, but is of little importance in this environment. The fowl is important domestically. The ordinary eastern Melanesian is dark-skinned (but not so dark as the people of the Western Solomons), heavily built, with much body-hair in the male, especially on thighs, back, and face. The short broad nose has open nostrils and a concave profile ; the eyes are deep-set, the brow ridges strong, the chin weak, and the head long and narrow. This type is old-established in the islands, and is</page><page sequence="3">MELANESIAN PEOPLES. 189 very pronounced in New Caledonia, which fact suggests that this rather isolated island cannot have received as many of the later immigrations as have the more centrally placed groups. New Caledonia would represent for these early types an ultimate home, and they doubtless reached it by movements from island to island, so that in many of the islands one finds, mixed with less rough types, individuals of this early variety of Homo sapiens. He is to be dis- tinguished from the black, wavy-haired Australian, wl*o lacks interest in navigation, and whose type, doubtless a very early variety of Homo sapiens, is probably not represented in Melanesia. The skull type and the brow ridges, the deep-set nose, and so on, are not unlike those of the Australians, but the hair is contrasted. In Melanesia, as in inter- tropical Africa, kinky hair dominates, but the hair in these two regions differs considerably. Light-skinned Mieronesians and wavy-haired, narrow-nosed, and sometimes light- skinned Polynesians must have passed through Melanesia and influenced types among the natives and Malays, and even Chinese have played a part too. Often one finds a rather slender figure, long-faced, narrow-nosed, and even light- skinned. New Guinea gives examples of immigrant coastal peoples with Melanesian languages and types, but Sidney Ray has shown that there is also a Papuan family of languages very distinct from the Melanesian, so the two groups of people should not be considered too closely related. Among the Papuans are some with big curved noses, whose type has been observed by native artists and used as a feature in carvings and the like in parts of Melanesia. Papuan languages also occur in Melanesia, for example, in the Baining District and among the Solomons, so there have been distinctively Papuan migrations into the island chains. In cases where these Papuan languages are in use on an island, culture seems often to be on a low level. But there are higher-grade Papuan cultures, belonging to the basin of the Sepik river, that have had great influence in Melanesia, especially in the Arué district on the western and southern coast of New Britain, and in Malekula in the New Hebrides. There are strong indications of Malay blood in the physique of the people of the Trobriand islands, and the Louisiade archipelago in general. The main stream of movements into Melanesia has been via the Molucca Islands, the north coast of New Guinea, New Britain, and New Ireland to the Solomons, but while some of these immigrations may be traced back far into Indonesia, others have come from the Philippines. The greater part of the inhospitable south coast of New Guinea was not touched by these movements. Some movements are doubtless relatively recent ; bronze cannon have been found on the coasts of New Guinea, the blow-pipe appears to be a recent intro- duction into New Britain, some wooden clubs in New Guinea are imitated from Chinese iron swords. In the interior of New Guinea are found big stone mortars which the present-day people can no longer make, and the pestles have now become charms, like the ancient</page><page sequence="4">190 GEOGRAPHY. axes of polished stone among the European peasantries. This stone- working culture spread through Melanesia, and Perry ascribed it to Egyptian influences, but the evidence is not convincing. It is probable that pressure from the Asiatic continent was a potent factor of the migrations, and some day it may become possible to link up periods of special pressure with periods of Melanesian migration. In the longer movements canoes would move in files, each boat trying to keep just in sight of the one in front and the one behind, and they moved against the trade wind and the related sea-drift, so they had the possibility of return. The canoe with outrigger could hold as many as 500 persons when built by Polynesians, but 100 would be about the limit for Melanesians. Decline in building- skill has reduced the size of these boats to about a half, but one sometimes finds the rotting remains of the older, larger ones. Interest in the sea tended to diminish when people found themselves well settled, and the death of a few craftsmen in a small population has often led to the loss of an art. We can imagine at what cost in life these movements were carried through, and what must have been the difficulties of commissariat, especially in some long voyages such as those which apparently took men from New Guinea to New Caledonia direct ; on such long direct voyages the men might fish for food, but obviously could not carry provender for pigs. The later people who spread into eastern Melanesia, beyond the region of the sago, must have had well -developed agricultural methods and a correspondingly rich material culture, but we find, in the southern New Hebrides and in south New Caledonia, a relatively poor develop- ment of rites and ceremonies. There is likely, therefore, to have been an early drift of man on a low level of culture, and we naturally find these men and this lowly culture in the marginal islands of our region. (a) This lowly culture lacked ideas of initiation and circumcision, and the people were naked at first. Ritual was poor, and there was a rudimentary belief in soul- substance. This, apparently with some patrilineal features of social organization, seems to have spread via Arué and Malekula to the southern New Hebrides and southern New Caledonia. (6) The introduction of circumcision led to the invention of a penis wrapper (Nambas) for the men ; a fringe skirt for the women was introduced too. In Arué the perinseal band was introduced as man's clothing from New Guinea, though this and circumcision and the nambas are not at all widespread in New Guinea. (c) The next spread of ideas into Melanesia seems to have brought conical masks, bone daggers, the bull roarer, true initiation ceremonies, and the reverencing of ancestors. The two last go together in many cases, for initiation seems to be essentially the admission of the young into the social heritage. The boys to be initiated are put on a miserable diet of what they can collect in the wild, and all the traditional foods are tabu, but one by one these traditional foods are offered to them " in first communion " by masked men representing the ancestors.</page><page sequence="5">MELANESIAN PEOPLES. 191 Circumcision and the knocking out of teeth are frequent accom- paniments of initiation, and one can see their analogies with changes that occur naturally during adolescence. Most of this ritual spread fairly widely in the Solomon Islands as well as to Malekula. The latter island stands out largely because of the well-protected landings on its south coast inside a reef with many islets. (d) Another wave of ideas has come to Malekula, but has left no trace in Arué. Instead, it touched Umboi or Rook Island nearby. Its contributions included the modelled head, which was later combined with the idea of the wooden statue of the ancestor and became in this way the skull-statue. There was also the rite of making a model crocodile swallow the boys at the initiation ceremony and then eject them. Pottery, wooden masks, monoliths, wooden birds on the houses, and a slit-gong of anthropomorphic type were other features of this culture. (e) Another wave of culture came from New Guinea to Arué, but did not go on to Malekula. It brought drums, the use of betel, and a patriarchal system. Betel- chewing spread far and wide in the Solomons. (/) Then must have come the elements which may be traced back to Nias, an island west of Sumatra. The bearers of these were probably the mythological Ambat, no doubt light-skinned Malays, and it is likely that they moved from Nias to Arué, and either they themselves deformed their heads or so impressed the natives by their high fore- heads as to give rise to a custom of head deformation producing high foreheads. They had masks with great curved tusks of the lower jaws of specially-kept boars, a deformation secured by removal of the tusks of the upper jaw. Ritual became attached to the killing of such boars, and the breeding and killing of these animals was the exclusive right of the chiefs of Arué. In Malekula, immigrants from New Guinea had developed elaborate initiation rites (c and d above), and secret societies with kava-drinking and the pig-killing idea fused with this scheme, giving rise to a scheme of social gradation and related ceremonial called Menggi. Pig -killing has spread all over the northern New Hebrides, and the Menggi with it. The latter is old in Aoba and in the Banks Islands, but it came to Espiritu Santo recently, and it is only now spreading inland there ; the mountain tribes have few of the special tusked boars, and the Menggi ceremonies are poor there. The farther one gets from southern Malekula the poorer these cere- monies become, but of course one must interpret " farther " with discretion ; difficulty may count for more than distance. In Santo there are usually but five grades in the Menggi, whereas in Malekula as many as thirty have been mentioned, with heavy payments at every promotion. The Melanesians' minds are much attracted by ritual, and the Menggi has spread beyond the region that uses the nambas. In the Banks Islands, the name suqué takes the place of Menggi, and there is here a rich development of men's societies, also a special</page><page sequence="6">192 GEOGRAPHY. feature - namely, monumental statues of tree-fern. The upright slit-gong has not been introduced into the Banks Islands. (g) From New Guinea to the north of New Caledonia there came direct, and probably about the same time as the movement to Arué and Malekula, ceremonial with masks, statues, a cult of skulls and other features showing partial analogies with what is found in Malekula. The New Guinea elements in both Malekula and north New Caledonia cultures seem to be derived from one of the cultures of the lower Sepik basin in northern New Guinea, which in its turn owed much to stimuli from Indonesia. It must have been a vigorous culture, because it influenced all Melanesia, north as well as south, save the southern New Hebrides and south New Caledonia. These remained at a low level of life and had apparently soon lost their inter- communications. The dates of these migrations, of culture and sometimes of peoples, are difficult to estimate. The lowly culture (a) of the New Hebrides and south New Caledonia must be very old. The culture using the Nambas (b above) is also of some age. As the coming of the Ambat is still in the tradition of Malekula, it is likely that it occurred ten generations ago at the most ; there is an analogous tradition in northern New Caledonia: Cook (1774) found head deformation in Malekula, and that is about five generations ago. Secret societies, elaborate ritual of payments for promotion in social grades with secret ceremonies all suggest the incoming of small groups dominating the older inhabitants, but ultimately fusing more or less into the general population, because the men took to them- selves native women. They had arrived in small groups, often com- posed of close relatives, and there was a feeling against marriage of such relatives. The population and native life of Melanesia is in process of rapid decay. In part this is no doubt due to the decline and disappearance of arts and crafts when the few practitioners of these in a small group have moved on or have died. In part, it is due to the interference of Europeans with the native life, and especially with its rituals, which are considered of such importance by the natives. For them the motives associated with maintenance of ritual and of schemes of social status on a ritual basis are more potent than the more directly economic and commercial motives so widespread among Europeans. The " Kula " scheme of ceremonial trade described by Malinowski for the Trobriand Isles in his " Argonauts of the Western Pacific," not only demonstrates that the ritual and courtesy aspect of the Kula is more important in the people's minds than the economic aspect, it also reveals an elaborate ritual that has probably evolved in large measure in relation to the local circumstances of a chain of islands near one another, and not large enough to possess an economie fermée within each. The study of the varieties of culture, and especially of ritual found in the different islands, hints at the complicated tangle of movements that have probably occurred within recent centuries, while the oldest</page><page sequence="7">MELANESIEN PEOPLES. 193 features may date back even some thousands of years. It is through Melanesia that much of the Polynesian population has reached its present homes, and Rivers made a special study of Tucopia as a gateway station on the route from Melanesia to Polynesia, preserving an early phase of Polynesian culture. Polynesia, as one would expect, lacks the lowly ancient element noted for Melanesia, and this difference works out all through the lives and rituals of the people. It would be interesting, but it is beyond the special purpose of this study, to try to estimate which features of the life of a particular island or group of islands are introductions from afar, and which, like the ceremonial trading above mentioned, and perhaps also the ceremonial fishing as a part of initiation rites in some cases, may be mainly local developments. Rivers thought that the early Melanesian peoples had a social organization of intermarrying groups with matrilineal descent, but there seems to be a patrilineal element in the culture described under (a) and (b) above. He noted that the drinking of kava was widespread in both Melanesia and Polynesia, and, in the former, it is associated especially with secret societies of the men. On the other hand, betel- chewing (see (e) above) is confined to northern Melanesia, and is thought to be merely a special development among some peoples who use, or used, kava and who acquired betel. The scheme of Rivers is thus in some points in accord, and in some points in contradiction, with the one sketched out in this article. Both are built upon the idea of migratory groups spreading from Indonesia via northern New Guinea into the far Pacific via Melanesia, which latter region had already received migrants of darker colour from the region of New Guinea. The present article has not gone into the question of the disposal of the dead which Rivers emphasised, nor has it taken up the study of the great stone monuments so widespread in Indonesia and the Pacific. These and other lines of evidence could be followed out to trace in still more detail the complex inter- weaving of threads of cultural tradition that has brought about divergence of custom, with nevertheless deep-lying similarities among the peoples of the myriad isles of Melanesia. Readers who wish to follow out this line of thought and to compare Melanesia with Polynesia may conveniently use Professor CD. Forde's new book, Habitat, Economy and Society, as a guide. They will find that kava drinking in Polynesia, while of great ceremonial consequence, is not there a secret rite, and that betel-chewing is unknown. Pigs are carefully reared, and taro and bread-fruit are more important than yams in the work of cultivation. Fishing is of outstanding importance, and ceremony gathers around this and every other aspect of economic and social life. The descendants of old canoe -leaders, or those who have replaced them, form a sacred aristocracy. Apart from the Fijians, the Polynesians made no pottery and could not weave, but they might stamp tapa cloth and could use coconut fibres effec- tively. The Maori, of New Zealand, highly skilled in many ways,</page><page sequence="8">194 GEOGRAPHY. found themselves in a land where most of the traditional foods would not grow, but they managed to cultivate some crops in the north of North Island and sweet potato rather more widely. In a good deal of the South Island they had to revert to a food gatherng and hunting system, and they depended largely on fish and on tree-fern roots, but the New Zealand flax gave them a valuable weaving material. The fact that, in spite of difficulties in agriculture, the Maori maintained so much of his culture is interesting evidence of Man's power to fight environmental difficulties. ♦ • » Will members please take note that the office of the Association will be glad to buy, in some cases for its own use, in some cases for the use of members who have made requests, copies of the following numbers of The Geographical Teacher and Geography : - No. 3 (June, 1902) ; No. 14 (Spring, 1906) ; No. 17 (Spring, 1907) ; No. 18 (Summer, 1907) ; No. 20 (Spring, 1908) ; No. 22 (Autumn, 1908) ; No. 23 (Spring, 1909) ; No. 34 (Autumn, 1912) ; No. 41 (Spring, 1915) ; No. 51 (Summer, 1918) ; No. 79 (Autumn, 1927).

The governing body of University College, Nottingham, decided early in the summer to create a separate department of Geography. The subject has developed steadily during past years under the direction of Professor H. H. Swinnerton, who has accomplished a great deal on its behalf, both in the College and generally throughout the East Midlands. Geography in this area owes a heavy debt to Professor Swinnerton for his pioneer labours in connection with the teaching of the subject, as well as for his work in geomorphology. In recent years the need for improved facilities has become urgent, and developments have proceeded rapidly, first with the co-operation of Mr. C. G. Beasley, M.A. (now Professor of Geography at the University of Rangoon), and latterly with that of Mr. K. C. Edwards, M.A. The new depart- ment will be in the charge of Mr. Edwards, with Mr. N. V. Scarfe, M.A., as his assistant. Our grateful thanks are due to Miss S. Haines, Messrs. G. W. Pirie, Charles Reed, P. C. L. Thorne, T. C.
