Pp. viii + 181. $15.50. Reviewed by August J. Fry, The Free University , Amsterdam At the outset of The Word's Body, Alia Bozarth-Campbell states with deceptive clarity that her "study will proceed by means of a sustained metaphor in which the art of inter- pretation is yoked with the act of incarnation in its theo- logical sense" (p. 2). Further on in the Introduction she adds, "Metaphor has always been the main linguistic tool of theology" (p. 11) . With these two statements the seeds of the confusion which follows have been sown, and the basic methodological argument from which all of the excesses of the book flow has been clearly revealed. It is possible, then, for her to conclude: This process [the process of interpretation] has been studied in the light of a metaphor: the original metaphor expressive of the Incar- nation and revelation of the Divine Word in Christian theology placed side by side with the metaphor of the human word becoming flesh and showing itself in the incarnational act of interpretation through performance, (p. 136) But is this a viable way to conduct an argument? To put the matter very simply, is it possible to take the human metaphor upon which the theological one has been based and compare the contents of the two without moving in circles? Speculation based upon the "content" of Christian theology can be very misleading when the nature of theologi- cal argumentation is overlooked or denied. Such speculation can be even more precarious when it is based, as it appears to be in this instance, upon a systematic misunderstanding of the nature of theological assertion, for there is no awareness here of the logic of our words about God or Review / 81</page><page sequence="2">of the place and function of a particular doctrine within the greater whole of Christian theology. Theology is not a wilderness of arbitrary symbols and metaphors, certainly not for the religious aesthetician any more than for the simple believer. The theological world of meaning and of discourse is restricted by the believer's understanding of the revelation of God which took place through Jesus Christ; and, except for the deed-word event of Jesus Christ, the God among us, no final statement may be made about the nature of God at all. Within these limits placed upon our speculation by Jesus, however, there is a wide variety of imagery to be considered. His many acts of love, together with his com- ments upon them, give us a wealth of metaphor with which to work. The image of God as father has proven to be a remark- ably fruitful metaphor, just as the parable of the Prodigal Son has revealed, within a very limited compass, how such a metaphor can be filled with meaning. The only restriction placed upon us is that of our living knowledge of the reve- lation itself, the active life of Christ within us. From the foregoing, which is necessarily brief, a few general conclusions may be drawn. All our talk about God is anthropomorphic; it cannot be otherwise. Such talk, then, will move from our knowledge of ourselves, outward and upward (to use the standard spatial metaphor of theology) toward God, whom we will never, I hope, presume to entrap in our frail cage of words. The imagery most central to our under- standing of the Deity is that which was first used by Jesus to describe our relation to him, and any images or metaphors which have subsequently entered our theology must be tested against those which he has given us. There is a sort of hierarchy of imagery, then, with the life of Jesus at the very top. Thus, the metaphorical statement "the Word became Flesh" is subject to the restrictions noted above. Because it is not one of the central images of the revelation, it must be treated with a certain reserve; and, because it is so very metaphorical, even greater caution ought to be taken. For words do not become flesh. And, having seen how problematic this metaphor is, it can only bring great confusion when it is turned back upon itself and the original metaphorical thrust is disregarded. Indeed, all talk about God is like this; it is little more than a complimentary way of talking about ourselves. To put the problem in a slightly different way, a meta- phor based upon the way in which words become real and effective in human life, the way in which "words become flesh," is taken as the most significant descriptive metaphor for revealing the meaning of the "act of interpretation." Review / 82</page><page sequence="3">And this complex of metaphorical meanings is to be compared to the theological context. And the key fact is that in this instance both the interpretational and the theological are based upon precisely the same metaphorical act. From my point of view, this is courting disaster; it is an invitation to enter a metaphorical hall of mirrors. Dis- cussions of the act of interpretation ultimately turn back upon the original metaphor, but the contributions from theology are merely examples of another way in which the same metaphor has been used. And, because the argument is so firmly in metaphor, there is no point at which one can say, this is a factual statement about a state of affairs. There can only be the state of the metaphor at any given time. Even a summary reading of the text reveals that this is the case. Where Bozarth-Campbell is not churning out the heady jargon of American academe, she is hopelessly entangled in the tentacles of her own methodological errors . In her- meneutics, for example, one has a "meeting," is "seized," and of course "enters into dialogue," while we are assured that "as the poem expresses itself it acts, feels, and thinks" (p. 28) . And, further, "in interpretation the poem and the human body move toward each other" (p. 31) . And yet, when the argument is continued in a certain way, it is not empty of truth until the jargon once again takes over: Literature in all cases can come to life only within the human body, whether it is read silently, seen and heard strictly from within, or read or performed aloud. Performance is, rather, the transformation of literature into its true, vital nature, from a potential state to actualization through the entelechy of in- carnation. (p. 120) It is truly unfortunate that the author has felt it necessary to repeat the mistake of Dorothy Sayers, whose The Mind of the Maker (1941) is based upon precisely the same theological error. Somewhere at the heart of the energies of this argument, there are the basic insights necessary to produce a significant statement about man's use of metaphor, both theological and interpretational; but, until the author has understood the nature of theological method and its relation to human experience, she is incapable of creating more than the confusion we have here. The book proves, finally, in a most vivid manner that man is the metaphorical animal. But who is to protect him from his many metaphors? Review /83</page></plain_text>
