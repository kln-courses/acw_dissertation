ABSTRACT The performance of three different six-year old dum- mies, the new Hybrid III six-year-old from First Tech- nology Safety Systems, the Part 572 Subpart I and the TNO P6, was compared in a series of HYGE sled tests. The dummies were tested on aftermarket booster cushions in a Volvo 850 sled buck. Two different sled pulses were used: a Volvo 850 30 mph frontal crash pulse and an ECE R.44 pulse. The behavior of the dummies was compared for these two sled pulses. Motion analysis from high speed film was performed, showing the trajectories of the dummy heads. All dummies were fitted with triaxial accelerometers in the head, chest and pelvis. The Hybrid III was also equipped with a chest deflection transducer and Denton six-channel upper neck and five-channel lumbar spine load cells. The signals from a number of these sensors were compared. INTRODUCTION The development of child dummies has been much slower than the development of adult size dummies. Furthermore, child dummies have fewer data channels available for injury assessment, and their biofidelity is less validated. This is mainly due to the lack of biome- chanical and anthropometrical data for children. Now, the situation is improving due to extensive development effort (1). One of the dummies addressed in (1) is the Hybrid III six-year-old, which is being tested in this pro- gram. The Hybrid III six-year-old child dummy was de- veloped in 1993 by the SAE Hybrid III Family Task Group in cooperation with First Technology Safety Sys- tems. The anthropometry of this dummy was derived by scaling the Hybrid III 50th percentile dummy. Two other six-year-old dummies are in common use. These are the CFR Part 572, Subpart I, 6-Year-Old Child and the TNO P6. The former has recently been included in the US test procedure FMVSS 213 (2). The ECE Regu- lation 44, which came into force in 1982, states the use of the P6 (3). There is an increasing demand for the assessment of neck loads in child dummies (4, 5). Although smaller children in forward facing child seats have been mostly focused on, the neck loads of older children on booster cushions are also of great interest. The Hybrid III six- year-old is the first child dummy where a six-channel neck transducer is included in the original design. In addition to the necessity of appropriate certification tools for child restraints, there is need for biofidelic, re- peatable and robust dummies for research and develop- ment. Ideally, this device would be one and the same. However, this is rarely the truth, since the development of test dummies is currently years ahead of the inclusion of new dummies within the legal test procedures. In the meantime, the developers of child restraints have to rely on the best dummy available, when it comes to instrumentation and biofidelity. In order not to sub- optimize in the development process, the behavior of this dummy also has to be consistent for various impact situations. Previous studies of child dummies have focused on the kinematics of the dummy in comparison with child ca- davers (6), or by means of an instrumented PMTO (Post Mortem Test Object) compare acceleration levels (7, 8). This study aims at the comparison of both the kine- matics and signal output from the sensors of these three dummies. Included is also the comparison of the behavior of the dummies in the presence of two different crash pulses. The goal is an evaluation of their practicability for the development of child restraints. Figure 1: 6-year old dummies: Hybrid III, Part 572, P6 1997</page><page sequence="2">MATERIALS AND METHODS The performance of the three dummies was compared in a series of HYGE sled tests. For efficiency, two dum- mies at a time were tested side by side. The dummies were seated face forward on aftermarket booster cushions in the rear seat of a Volvo 850 sled buck. They were re- strained by the standard three point belts, which were exchanged between each test, as were the booster cushions. Table 1 lists the test program. The right and left side of the seat was regarded as equal, so each dummy re- mained on the same side in consecutive tests. DUMMY DESIGN - Two different approaches in the design of child dummies can be distinguished. The US child dummies, 3 and 6 years of age, included in CFR Part 572, are fitted with a steel skeleton, covered with foam flesh and vinyl skin. The TNO child dummies, to the contrary, include fewer metal parts, but the molded plastic body parts are reinforced by metal structures. The pelvis of the Hybrid ΙΠ is clearly different from the other pelves, since it comprises the buttocks and top- most parts of the thighs. This design gives the Hybrid III a steadier seated position. While the dimensions of the body parts correspond quite well between the dummies, the stiffness of the spine and neck is very different. The P6 has the softest spine and neck, and also the shortest rigid back between the lumbar spine and the neck. The lumbar spine of the Part 572 is very stiff, which forces this dummy to bend at the pelvis-to-femur joint instead. Table 2 lists the princi- pal dimensions of the dummies. The placement of the chest accelerometer, in terms of height above the seat varies between the dummies. In the Part 572, the chest accelerometer is located 6 cm above that in the Hybrid HI. There is also a notable difference in head and neck mass, with the Part 572 having the lightest head and neck and the Hybrid III the heaviest. SLED PULSE - Two different sled pulses were used: a Volvo 850 30 mph rigid barrier frontal crash pulse and an ECE R.44 frontal crash pulse, used for child seat certification in Europe. The motive for the use of two pulses was to study the dummy behavior under different loading conditions. The maximum acceleration and deltaV is equal in both pulses. The peak occurs between 10 and 30 ms for the 850-pulse, but around 55 ms for the R.44-pulse. The shapes of the pulses are outlined in figure 2, which also shows the boundaries for the R.44- pulse. INSTRUMENTATION - All dummies were fitted with triaxial accelerometers in the head, chest and pelvis. The accelerometers were Endevco 7264-2000 for the Part 572 and the P6, while the Hybrid III utilized Endevco 7267. The pelvis accelerometers in the P6 were mounted to a specially designed bracket in the pelvis cavity. In addition, the Hybrid III dummy was equipped Table 1: Test program Te* ικ», 1 850 Part 572 Hybrid III 2 850 Part 572 Hybrid III 3 850 Part 572 P6 4 850 Hybrid III P6 5 850 Hybrid III P6 6 R.44 Hybrid III P6 7 R.44 Hybrid III P6 8 R.44 Hybrid III Part 572 with a chest deflection transducer and Denton six- channel upper neck and five-channel lumbar spine load cells. Only the head and chest accelerations of all dummies, and the neck loads of the Hybrid III, were analyzed in this study. The data channels were sampled at 8000 Hz and fil- tered in accordance with the SAE Recommended Practice J211 Oct.-88. CALIBRATION - The Part 572 and the P6 dummies were calibrated before the test series as prescribed (2, 3). Table 2: Dummy dimensions. Measures in centimeters.

The dummies were checked between tests and their joints were adjusted as prescribed. FILM ANALYSIS - High speed cameras, shooting 1000 frames/second, were placed laterally on each side of the sled buck. The films were analyzed using manual tracking of targets on the heads of the dummies. One point was recorded every fifth millisecond. RESULTS MOTION ANALYSIS - Due to the relatively late peak sled acceleration in the R.44-pulse, the behavior of the dummies during this test is quite different from the 850-pulse test. The heads of the Hybrid III and P6 dum- mies show greater downward displacement when the R.44-pulse is applied. The trajectories of the dummy heads are pictured in figures 3 and 4, where the times for the end of the for- ward and downward motion are indicated. The horizontal excursion is smallest with the Hy- brid III, as small with the Part 572 in the R.44-tests, and largest with the P6 in both test configurations. The P6 also shows the largest vertical displacement, followed by the Hybrid III, with 10 to 100 mm less displacement. The large downward motion of the P6-head often results in hard contact with its thighs. Such impacts are not refer- enced in previous studies with human subjects (7, 8). The Part 572 shows a quite different motion pattern, with less than 40 mm vertical distance between the forward and return path. The differences in motion can mainly be attributed to the design of the spine and neck. The soft lumbar spine and neck of the P6 allows much greater motion, including bending of the torso, which is not seen in the Part 572. The lumbar spine of the Hybrid III works better together with its molded pelvis, which is not tilted as much as the pelvis of the Part 572, during the forward motion. The neck-stiffness of the Part 572 produces a swifter rebound of the head than is the case with the other dum- mies, where the head lags behind the torso in the re- bound. The smaller mass of the Part 572-head most likely plays a role in the different motion of this dummy. ACCELERATIONS - Table 3 lists descriptive statis- tics for Hr (Head resultant acceleration), Q (3ms) (Chest resultant acceleration, 3ms clip), C, (3ms) (Chest vertical acceleration, 3ms clip), and HIC. Head acceleration and HIC - With the 850-pulse the Hybrid ΠΙ showed the lowest values of Hr (3ms) and HIC. The Hr (3ms) for the Part 572 was 17 percent higher and for the P6, 23 percent higher than for the Hybrid III. The corresponding HIC for the P6 was 48 percent higher. The Part 572 experienced hard contact between the chin and the chest with the 850-pulse, resulting in a high negative spike in the vertical acceleration. This short Figure 2: Comparison 850-pulse/R44-pulse. Filtered CFC60. The grey lines denote the ECER-44 frontal impact pulse corridor spike did not affect Hr (3ms), but increases Gmax (maximum resultant head acceleration) for the head by some 30 percent. In all but one test with the P6 the head struck the knee or thigh, causing a high peak in the head acceleration at 90 and 120 ms for 850- and R.44-pulse respectively. This is clearly visible in figures 5 and 6. A similar head-thigh contact was seen with the Hybrid III in one test, but its duration was not long enough to affect Hr (3ms). With the R.44-pulse, the Hybrid III- and Part 572 head signals were quite similar, but the above-mentioned hard head-knee contact for the P6 caused 70 percent higher Hr (3 ms) and 68 percent higher HIC than the Hybrid III. Since no impact of the head into interior structures were seen, the relevance of HIC as an injury criterion can be questioned. Impacts to the head from other body parts of the dummy itself, should be excluded from the HIC- calculation, according to the legal test procedures (FMVSS 213). No signs of ringing in the head or neck could be found in the Hybrid III or Part 572, but the head channels of the P6 were contaminated with high frequency noise. These disturbances are not attenuated by the SAE class 1000 filter, and thus increase the maximum readings. The rebound of the head against the backrest caused horizontal head acceleration peaks with both the 850- and R.44-pulse, when the Part 572 and Hybrid Ill-dummies were used. This is due to their stiff spine, which articu- lates only in the lumbar region. The peak can be seen at 140 to 160 ms for the Part 572 in figure 5. The P6 was less affected by a hard rebound. Chest Acceleration - Figures 7 and 8 show Cr, and figures 9 and 10 show Cv. In the 850-tests, the Cr (3ms) for the Hybrid III was 15 percent higher than for the Part 572, but 20 percent lower than the corresponding value for the P6. The chin- to-chest contact in the Part 572 caused a peak with sub- stantial magnitude at 70 ms, as can be seen in figure 7. A similar peak occurs with the P6, but the cause of this is not as clear, since the head of the P6 has no chin. 1999</page><page sequence="4">Table 3: Descriptive statistics. Acceleration values in [gl. The Cy (3ms)-values were comparable, except for the higher readings for the P6 with the R.44-pulse. However, the shapes of the curves show dramatic differences. While the Part 572 and the Hybrid III almost only show negative Cy-values, the P6 shows mostly positive values.The reason for this is that the P6 bends at the lumbar spine and folds almost like a jack-knife, but the other dummies keep the same torso-inclination during the forward motion. With the 850-pulse, the bending of the P6 spine starts at 50 ms, and when its head strikes its thighs, at 65 ms, a negative Cv- peak is induced. Repeatability - The variability in the results between repeated tests is due to performance differences in the ac- celerator sled, booster cushion, belt system, test-setup including dummy positioning and, finally, the repeat- ability of the test dummy itself. The repeatability of the former items, except for the HYGE-sled-pulse, has not been established. With a serious attempt to keep the test- setup identical, it is reasonable to address the variation of the test results to the dummy. The repeatability (coefficient of variation, c.v.) for the Hybrid III was between 1.5 and 13 percent, with 1 1 per- cent for Hr (3ms) in the 850-tests, and 13 percent for Cy (3ms) in R.44 tests as the least repeatable values. More than three similar tests would have been required, to pro- duce more reliable c.v.-calculations. The results were similar for the Part 572, but too few tests were carried out with the R.44-pulse to estimate c.v. Slightly lower c.v.-values were achieved in a previous study (9). The sled pulse utilized in this test was, how- ever, different from those being used here. The head-to-thigh contacts caused greater variability with the P6 in the 850-tests. The c.v. for HIC was 27 per- cent, and for Hr (3 ms) and Cv (3ms) it was above 20 per- cent. Figures 1 1 through 13 show the traces for head resul- tant acceleration for the 850-pulse tests. It can be seen here that not only the maximum values vary for the P6, but there is also a great variability at all times, due to the pronounced noise in the signals. NECK LOADS - Since only the Hybrid III was equipped with a neck load cell, only a comparison be- tween the different pulses can be made. Figures 14 through 16 show the neck load signals. When the dummy starts to load the belt at 40 ms in the 850-pulse, Fx increases to the negative direction, which indicates a forward pulling shear force. This force is pre- sent until the beginning of the rebound. The dip at 65 ms corresponds to the point where the head is at its most forward position. The My-signal shows that there is first a phase where the head lags behind the forward motion of the torso, between 35 and 65 ms for the 850-pulse. At 65 ms, the neck moment crosses zero, indicating that the head after this point in time rotates forward, until the rebound starts. The maximum values of the Fz, coincides with a 90- degrees tilting of the head, and a high sled acceleration. When the head tilt-angle is more than 90-degrees, the Fz is lowered, which occurs at 65 ms for the 850-pulse. The peak Fx and My values are reached approximately 40 ms later with the R.44-pulse than with the 850-pulse. The mechanism for the neck loads is the same for the R.44- pulse, but its longer duration attenuates the peaks. My shows the greatest difference in maximum values, with the R.44-pulse producing only 30 percent of the maximum load in the 850-pulse. For Fx and Fz, the rela- tionship is 50 percent and 65 percent. DURABILITY - From these few tests no certain statements can be made about the durability of any of the dummies. It is obvious that with the smaller dimensions of the limbs of the Hybrid III compared to the Part 572, it is more prone to break at weak points. Three damaged parts were found after the test series: the chest bib had a 5 cm crack at the top, the extension stop screw at the elbow 2000 Hybrid III Part 572 P6 850- HIC Hr(3ms) G,(3ms) C*(3ms)i HfC Hr(3ms) C$ms) Cv(3ms) HIC Harris) C,{3ms) Cy(3ms) pulse * ; Mean lOll 81.6 63.3 31.7 1083 95.3 54.0 30.7 1602 117.3 65.0 28.7 59.8 9.0 0.9 2.6 37.5 5.2 1.6 6.1 435.6 25.0 5.1 6.0 dev.

This shows that some parts of the Hybrid III are underesti- mated in size. As a comparison, from a number of previ- ous test series carried out at Volvo, the Part 572 has proved to be very robust, whereas the P6 may unex- pectedly break the neck or a joint. The absence of a dynamic calibration procedure for the P6 retards the detection of worn out parts. Instead of indicating aging during the calibration, through non-con- formance with the specification, the worn parts may fail during test. DISCUSSION The anthropometry of the three dummies differ slightly, with the mass of the heads as the most notable difference. The spine of the Hybrid III is more flexible than the Part 572-dummy, but more rigid than the P6. Previous investigators (6, 10), argue that the kinematics of a three year old child is best simulated by a flexible spine as in the TNO-dummies. It is probable that if the spine of the Hybrid III was flexible also in the thoracic region, the motion-pattern would be different. The maximum acceleration values of the Hybrid III and Part 572-dummies were so similar, that they could replace each other, without changing proposed injury criteria. The P6, on the other hand, produced con- siderably higher head accelerations, which makes test results with this dummy difficult to compare with results from the other. The higher head accelerations found with the P6 is in agreement with a previous comparison be- tween 3-year old dummies (6). A more detailed compari- son of results obtained in other studies was not fruitful, due to differences in either the pulse (shape, energy con- tent and delta V), dummy size, or child restraint configu- ration. Although only a few tests with each test-setup was performed, the repeatability for the Hybrid III and the Part 572 is judged good, except for Cv (3ms). The P6 per- forms well with the R.44-pulse, but with the 850-pulse its repeatability deteriorates, due to its variability in motion. It is obvious, also from earlier tests (1 1), that the freedom of movement in the P-series child dummies may lead to a less repeatable test device. This is an apparent disadvan- tage during development testing of child restraint sys- tems, since results can be difficult to interpret. The data channels from the Hybrid III did not exhibit visible noise from mechanical deficiencies of the dummy, which is apparent in the P6. Also in comparison with the Part 572, the signals of the Hybrid III are smoother, and the maximum values do not originate from several sharp local maxima, but from one distinct maximum. SUMMARY The Hybrid III six-year-old dummy proves to be a re- peatable test device as is the Part 572. The P6 lacks in repeatability when a faster pulse than the R.44-pulse is applied, due to an unfavorable movement pattern, where the head strikes the thighs. The Hybrid III six year old, with its extended meas- urement capabilities, is clearly a useful addition to the family of six-year-old child dummies. A careful investi- gation of its biofidelity, leading to commonly accepted injury criteria, would further extend its applicability. REFERENCES 1 . Mertz, H.
