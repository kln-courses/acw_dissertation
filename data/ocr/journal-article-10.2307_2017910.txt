Such a task has been repeatedly undertaken throughout the history of philosophy, but seldom, one imagines, with the thoroughness of M. Gherea. Starting with simple "intuitions," he admits only two sorts of "simple existence": processes (des de- venirs) and "ideas." The rest is constructed from them. The writer of this notice would quarrel with M. Ghere'a's in- terpretation of "intuition" which probably has a history of its own and is therefore not the simple and unanalysable apprehension of something which it is taken to be. But if one grants his start- ing point and method, one will find much to ruminate upon in this singularly penetrating essay. The great difficulty of all such idealistic theories is the discrepancy between them and what one might call our practical life. If everything is constructed by the "spirit," why should the appearance of objectivity arise? This is not, of course, a fatal question by any means, since there is no reason why the world should not be absurd and tragic. M. Gherea has enough of the poet in him to admit such a possibility. His book is rather a challenge to the rest of us to give good reasons for our beliefs than an attempt to justify them. G. B.</page></plain_text>
