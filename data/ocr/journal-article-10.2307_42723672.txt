<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN THE NURSERY AND KINDERGARTEN Paul B. Irwin, Assistant Professor of Religious Education School of Religion, University of Southern California The assumption with which this article commences is that nursery and kindergarten education to serve the whole child must include religion« It is the very nature of religion to unify - to make whole, healthy and free. As the ligament makes it possible for the body to operate with oneness and economy, so religion is essential if the person is to live with moral integrity and spiritual power. But does religion really function in an integrative way at the practical, everyday level? For many teachers, their own experience with religion on its formal side has not been convinc- ing. Many teachers have rejected religion, consciously or unconsciously, because their own religious education as child and youth had been so un- satisfactory» With such persons in mind a writer of religion and psycho- therapy, David E. Roberts, states: "Many of us reach maturity with social, moral and religious assumptions which we have either passively accepted or had forced down our throats, instead of having found an opportunity to work them out and verify them for ourselves." (l) For a host of adults, among them many teachers, this is putting the matter in a "nut-shell." It states their dissatisfaction with religion and in a few words explains why. Religion for theye people has been something superimposed. It has had no meaningful rootage in experience. It has not been integral to their growing up. The seriousness of the charge prompts further analysis of the problem. What are the psychodynamic results when religion is taught as verbally conveyed abstractions to be accepted because they come from a sacred book or because an adult arbitrarily claims them to be true? As Roberts suggests there are essentially two ways of reacting to such religious educa- tion. The first is for the child to remain "docile and subservient." He may get along without much trouble with his inherited beliefs. Religion is largely a matter of habit with him. But his position is vulnerable. Let a crisis arise and the growing person finds little strength or faith to face it. A blind clinging will serve only to leave him in despair. A second way is for the child or youth to rebel. The rebellion can be one of open conflict with parent or teacher, and with things and persons in general. Frequently the reaction includes a "deep-seated revulsion for the Church" because "it is pervasively associated with oppressive restrictions." (2) of course the revolt is often covert. The child represses his rebellion but subsequently expresses it unconsciously through deviant behavior that frequently leaves him with painful guilt feelings and sometimes with impaired emotional health. The indictment stands J The alternative, however, is not to reject religion but to substitute for authoritarian imposition an approach that draws upon the best insights from religion itself and from the sciences of learning and personality development. It is important to understand that the modern student of religion utilizes the same sociological, psychological, anthropological and philosophical disciplines as his colleagues in other fields of critical study. He approaches religion as a function of the culture- - 5 -</page><page sequence="2">a phenomenon of man's total experience with his fellow man, himself, the world of nature and of artifacts, and the whole of the environing universe. Historically, man first interpreted the impact of his experience through the primitive symbols of mana and anthropomorphic "spirits" or "gods"; then with cultural advancement he learned to understand the "divine" in teims of moral and spiritual values in cosmic context. It was the awareness of the spiritual significance of social and political events and the ethical sensitivity to human need of the prophet or religious genius that helped the peoples to see life in perspective, to see it from the vantage of the universal and ultimate. The prophet who could say "Thus saith the Lord!" first "heard" the "voice" in and through the impact of hi6 own experience. Confronted by the suffering of the underprivileged, the herdsman Amos could cry out in the name of the Lord, "Let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness like an everf lowing stream." (Amos 2i*) Hosea, having loved and forgiven a hapless woman - his wife - could speak to his people of the Eternal love and mercy by which life is renewed and made whole again. How often Jesus drew upon the events of his time and the little everyday happen- ings of his fellow-folk to interpret the inherent divine intention for men and the conditions of the good life I The story of all the world religions makes it clear that religion is not extraneous to life to be superimposed but an emerging quality of life, holding together and organizing the multi- plicity of experiences into a total pattern of meaning and worth whereby man can venture forth in faith and creativity, judge his personal and communal life, and find the resources for self-renewal and social recon- struction. For the adult teacher who finds his religious emancipation in such an orientation, religious education will begin with this understanding of religion as a natural thing with natural beginnings and developments. But the natural and developmental concept of religion applies equally to the present and the growing person. Like his forefathers, so the little child of every generation must find his religion, first of all, in the experience world about him. Modem educational theory supports this claim. Learning by or in and through experience is fundamental to an adequate philosophy of education. A philosophy of religious education is no exception. This has been hard for parents and teachers in church and synagogue to understand. How logically right it seems to take the lofty and refined expressions of religion as they are found in the sacred writings and to present them to the child. Is it not sound to conserve and transmit the values by which a culture lives and maintains itself? But how psychologically unsound to assume that a little child can learn at second-hand what his adult fore- fathers learned at first-hand i Tobe sure he can memorize verses and repeat phrases. But his emotional reaction in the long run to this mechanical and additive approach is clearly defined in the Robert's analysis above. This position of course must be modified to make a place for vicarious learning. The time comes when the older child can with profit read or listen to stories of old, but these will have functional meaning for him only if he has had in his own experience that to which the past may speak. So a religious education that is true to the nature of religion itself and to learning theory will begin with the child at the experiential level. It is further proposed that a religious education will exploit the insights accruing to the study of personality development. The - 6 -</page><page sequence="3">data of such stucty, especially from clinical practice and research, are much a part now of the typical nurs e ry-kinde rgart en teacher's fund of knowledge. Moreover, she has acquired many of the techniques of a mental hygiene approach and uses these as expressions of her own personal-social maturity. She knows and can implement the importance of human relations in education. Now those in religion who assume the ftame of reference which this discussion has sought to develop briefly and who have made a study of the processes by which religious development takes place have come to state their task in terms of spiritual hygiene. More than that, they believe that spiritual hygiene and mental hygiene are "inseparably linked together." Mrs. Sophia Iyons Fahs states the position succinctly: The foundations for the development of one are the same as the foundations for the development of the other. Whether in the home or in the church school nursery, whether the adults in charge be trained psychologists or religious workers, the processes of growth and the condi- tions of growth are one and the same. (3) What does such an educational philosophy, a mental and spiritual hygiene approach, look like in terms of specific goals? How does it actually operate in the school? The answer is suggested by a case study made in a well known nurseiy-kindergarten school. The observation is of a three-year-old girl suffering from extreme myopia. Her clinging, with- drawn behavior meant to the trained worker serious emotional insecurity, feelings of anxiety, social ru alad j ustment , and inhibited creative self- expression. The attitude and approach of the staff - what every clinically oriented worker assumes to be sound and desirable- was one of acceptance. There was no verbalizing of "oughts" or "don'ts." There was no "pushing forward," no manipulating, no instructing. How unsound and utterly out of place are moralizing, exhortation, demanding and contriving in the modern nursery school! No, the approach was to supply a warm social climate - rapport, attention and affection, but affection without anxious solicitude. It was through this relationship, providing acceptance and permitting honest emotional expression, that the child felt, first of all, wanted, and secondly, free to be herself as she felt it, even her sick self. It is in this re- lationship that the first principle of emotional and social growth is to be found. When such conditions are met, when this principle becomes operative, then the child is psychologically ready to take the next step, to find a healthier or more mature self concept. This is the response made by the little myopic child. At the time this writer made his visit to the school, she was still having problems. But she was no longer an isolate. She was now at play and making real strides toward peer group participation at the three-and-a-half developmental level. At one point she courageously mounted one of those lengthy oblong blocks and walked it with remarkable balance, even leaping from one block to another across a "chasm" of four or five inches. This the modern nursery school teacher acknowledges is what a mental hygiene approach can do for a child. This the worker knows is not only the approach to the exceptional child but the normative approach re- quired of «11 children. For every child has the same fundamental need to be accepted and loved, to feel he genuinely belongs. - 7 -</page><page sequence="4">For the trained nursery school worker this observation and interpretive comment may no doubt be concluded with a Q.E.D. written after it. There is no argument about its story. But where does religion or religious education fit in? How frequently this question is asked by parents observing in the church nursery school where a mental hygiene approach is practiced. "I am fascinated by what I find here. I want my child to "have this kind of guidance. But when do you start teaching re- ligion?" The answer, perhaps, depends on what is meant by "teaching." If by teaching is meant the telling of Bible stories and the memorizing of scripture verses or building a Palestinian house of blocks, then religious teaching in such a school has not begun and will not be under- taken during the nursery years. But for those who see the interrelated nature of mental and spiritual hygiene, religious teaching is precisely what has been done all along. What could be more clearly symbolic of the religious growth of the myopic child than her leap from one block to another i If faith may be interpreted back into its original Hebraic meaning "to trust and be entrusted," then hers was indeed a "leap of faith." Religious education in both private and public nursery education means drawing upon the everyday experiences of the home and school environ- ment to meet the fundamental emotional-spiritual needs inherent in human striving. It means translating the insights of prophet and saint into dynamic and developmental processes and following their educational leads as the child makes his way in his own world. It means providing a relation- ship of acceptance, of self-giving love whereby the child can accept and trust himself and in turn accept and trust his fellows. Jesus lifted up the first law of life and called attention to the importance of loving one 's neighbor as oneself. Today's psychiatrist offers convincing clinical evidence of the interrelatedness of self-acceptance and acceptance of others. Self-affirmation and feelings of self-worth seem to be the emotional con- ditions for a spontaneous expression of interest, love and concern toward others. It means, further, providing full play opportunity whereby the child can give expression to ripening imagination and emerging mental- manual abilities in free and honest ways. Such activity develops a sense of achievement, integrity and self -worth. It means allowing for the sharing of things and privileges to encourage give-and-take attitudes, social consciousness and responsibility. In the quality of such experience lies the foundations of the child's mental-spiritual growth. There is an additional aspect to religious education especially at the kindergarten age. Up to this point in the discussion the emphasis has been upon emotional and social development. But religion also brings meaning and purpose out of experience. Feeling, attitude and social skill are interwoven with intelligent awareness and understanding. Encouraging the child to explore his experiences for their meanings is therefore another essential of religious education in the nursery school and kindergarten. The inherent questing spirit of the child and the developing facility with language calls attention to the naturalness of the teacher's task. She need only follow her young aroundj the questions about this and that and everything abound. There are "wonder" questions about nature and human relations, about birth and death, about the human body and the "self." - e -</page><page sequence="5">Werner Wolff has discerned from his research that behind all the young child's questioning, behind all expressions of his behavior is the fundamental inquiry: "Who am I? What am I for?" w) His search for his self, his origin and place in the scheme of things is pervasive. This, of course, is precisely the central concera of the religious quest. In its classic form it is the Psalmist reflecting upon the expanse and beauty of the world about him, standing reverently before its ultimate mystery, yet asking, "0 Lord I what is man that thou art mindful of him. ..." And then answering, "Thou has made him little less than God, and dost crown him with glory and honor. Thou has given him dominion over the works of thy hands..." (Psalm 8s U-6.) Many of the questions asked by the child are no less profound. It is just this underlying profoundness of the questioning, however, that causes some uncertainty for the conscientious teacher. "How can I deal with the child at this level of his experience? Does this not call for a mature understanding of philosophy and religion on the part of the teacher?" To be sure a teacher will want to pursue the study of religion as an educational resource, to say nothing of its use in meeting personal needs. But the teacher's knowledge of child development and the educational task in general should be reassuring in this regard. If she is imaginative and relaxed she can talk it over with the child, or with the several who may be gathered about. The whole "discussion^ may take but a moment, giving all the satisfacfcion desired for the present. The only rightness of answer is in honest answering, in the good judgment of the mature teacher, in the teacher's trust of the child's creative capacity. A systematic theological knowledge is not at all essential. It may only serve to make communication less meaningful and thwart the child's effort at creative thinking. In this regard it is important to keep in mind that the child not only asks questions but delights in answering them for himself. Why not reflect the question and let the child venture his own answer? Just as the Psalmist did. The Psalmist of course was religiously sophisticated* He was "grown-up" at the business. But is it not the spontaneity of feeling, the integrity of self-expression in open inquiry, and the oourage and capacity to venture an answer that makes the 8th Psalm so appealing to the searching mind? Is this not, moreover, the objective Roberts has in mind in complaining that so many adults have not had opportunity to work out social, moral and religious ideas and to verify them for themselves? The * A story approach is also helpful. Written for this very purpose were the "Martin and Judy" series by Verna Hills and Sophia L. Fahs (Boston: Beacon Press, 1939-19U3. ) These do not set forth moral principles or biblical lessons, but tell of interesting everyday experiences which provoke the natural wonder and thought of the child. The volume Consider the Children - How They Grow (revised in 1951) by Manwell and Fahs is intended as a guide for parent and teacher. See also Mrs. Fahs' more recent volume Today's Children and Yesterday's Heritage (Boston: Beacon Press, 1952) for further discussion of a hygiene approach but with more attention given to the biblical and theological. - 9 -</page><page sequence="6">emotional freedom and intellectual ability to reflect upon the "infinitely great and interesting world without and within," the courage to affirm one's purposeful position in the uni ve irse, and the will to acknowledge the moral responsibility of man's cosmic related and value with the maturity of the Psalmist are fruits of long years of nurture and de- velopment. If these are among the objectives of a religious education, foundations must be laid in the early years. The task of a nursery-kindergarten education that would serve the whole child is to build the foundations of this mental and spiritual destiny. Let others working with older boys and girls, adolescents and youth explore with them the religious cultures of past and present for systems of value and meanings let others introduce growing persons to the techniques and practices of formal religion. Let the teacher of nursery and kindergarten - whether public or private, church related or not - build "community" - a social climate of permissive warmth and belongingness; let her stimulate imaginative play and healthy peer association; let her guide "turn-taking" and sharing activities; let her encourage reflection and honest inquiry; let her invite inventive answer-giving and discussion; let her give opportunity for the child to feel the sustaining and re- newing "presence," and to stand for the moment in his own way reverently before the mystery of it all. This is to enjoy at tender age one 's re- ligious birth-right. It is for the child to grow full-rounded and free; to know wholeness of selfhood through holiness of experience. It is what many religious persons have meant by the knowledge and the love of God.
