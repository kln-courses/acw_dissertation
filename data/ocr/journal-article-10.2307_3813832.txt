<plain_text><page sequence="1">IVAR PAULSON Outline of Permian Folk Religion I According to Finno-Ugric philology, the so-called Finno-Ugric lin- guistic period (third pre-Christian millennium) is followed by the Finno- Permian period.' During this period the ancestors of the later Ugric peoples (Hungarians, Voguls, and Ostyaks) must have already separated from the linguistic community of the Finno-Ugric peoples. The sub- sequent Finno-Permian period with a so-called Finno-Permian common language is placed by philologists in the second pre-Christian millen- nium. While the ancestors of the later Ugric peoples formed an inde- pendent linguistic branch at that time, the Finno-Permian peoples formed a western branch to which the ancestors of the later Permian, Volga- Finnic, and Balto-Finnic peoples belonged. Culturally and historically this period belongs to the end of the Neolithicum and the beginning of the Bronze Age with a type of economy, social order, and religion greatly different from that of the preceding centuries. While the cultural pattern of the Finno-Ugric period, based on the common vocabulary, still in- dicates a predominantly hunter-collector economy with fishing in par- ticular as the most important means of livelihood, the Finno-Permian peoples, according to the linguistic and prehistoric data, were already occupied with cattle breeding and a primitive cultivation of fields. This presupposes a more settled way of life and a concentration of settlements 1 Jozsef Szinnyei, Finnisch-ugrische Sprachwissenschaft (Berlin &amp; Leipzig, 1922); Uuno T.

Today they form the so-called Permian group of the Finno-Ugric ethnic family, consisting of two peoples very closely related linguistically, namely the Zyrians and Votyaks. So far, Western research has learned as little about their folk religion as about their old folk cul- ture in general, since for this part of Finno-Ugric ethnography and folklore - in contrast to the Volga-Finnic and Balto-Finnic peoples - the literature as well as some of the published sources are not available in the great Western languages.3 A clear orientation in this matter is all the more necessary in the interest of international folkloristic exchange, since the Permian peoples have preserved interesting archaic features in their antiquated folk religion, in which both the ecotypically basic agrar- 2 Ilmari Manninen, Die finnisch-ugrischen Volker (Leipzig, 1932), p. 229 ff.; Toivo Vuorela, Suomensukuiset kansat (Helsinki, 1960), p. 7 ff., pp. 245 ff.; Richard In- dreko, Origin and Area of Settlement of the Finno-Ugrian Peoples (= Publications of the Scientific Quarterly "Scholar," No. 1) (Heidelberg, 1948). 3 The folk-religion of the Permian peoples has been clearly presented only in a Fin- nish summary by Uno Harva, Permalaisten uskonto (Porvoo &amp; Helsinki, 1914).

The Zyrians (Komi) live today in the autonomous Soviet Republic of the Komi in northeastern European Russia, as well as in contiguous areas of the Russian Soviet Republic. According to the latest figures they number 431,000 people. The North Zyrians live mainly in the area of the great rivers of the Vychegda, Mezen, Izhma, and Pechora (former provinces of Vologda and Arkangelsk); the South Zyrians (Permyaks) live at the upper course of the Kama River in the Permyak district (area of Perm, formerly Molotov). The Votyaks (Udmurts), their southern neighbors and closest linguistic relatives, live today in the autonomous Soviet Republic of the Udmurts between the Kama River and the Vyatka River and number 623,000 people. In contrast to the Zyrians, who are scattered over wide areas, they form a relatively uniform group of settle- ments, and only a small number of the Votyaks live outside of their Soviet Republic in the areas that border on it (former provinces of Kazan, Perm, Ufa, and Samara). The original Permian people, that is, the ancestors of the present-day Zyrians and Votyaks, still occupied very wide areas of the northeastern part of European Russia up to one thousand years ago, and were ob- viously the bearers of the prehistoric Permian culture of the Bronze Age, and especially of the later Iron Age. The proximity of the neighboring Turkish-Tatar peoples, however, especially the Bolgars who founded the center of Bolgary in the eighth century A. D. on the middle Volga which was so important for East-West trade at that time, had a very lasting effect socially and historically on the Votyaks, who were included in the region of authority of Greater Bolgary. The separation of the two Permian languages did not take place until the 9th or 10th century A.D.; this is why they are very close to each other. Zyrian is divided today into three provincially differentiated dialects: Komi-Zyrian (North Zyrian), Komi-Permyak, and Komi-Jazvan. The Bessermans or Bussur- mans, who live in the former province of Vyatka, district of Glazov, and who speak Votyak, are included among the more linguistically uniform Votyaks, although they were originally of Turkish-Tatar ethnic descent and did not exchange their mother tongue for Votyak until later. In 1926 they numbered 10,035. The Zyrians came under Russian influence as early as the end of the 11th century A.D., when the Novgorod fur traders began to tax them. 150</page><page sequence="4">OUTLINE OF PERMIAN FOLK RELIGION After the end of the 14th century they were christianized by the Russian Orthodox Church. The Votyaks, on the other hand, after the conquest of Greater Bolgary by the Mongols in the middle of the 13th century, came under Tatar rule, which did not end until the fall of the Tatar Fort of Kazan to the Russians in 1552. Therefore they have been less influ- enced by the Russians than were the Zyrians. Moreover, the same is true of the Christianization of these people, which did not begin until the 17th and 18th centuries. As recently as 1897, 7.5 percent of the Votyaks were counted as heathens (i.e. they were unbaptized at that time). In addition to the official Russian Orthodox creed, the Zyrians as well as the Votyaks, but particularly the latter, have preserved much of their old folk belief up until the most recent times. A folk culture, markedly rural up until the First World War, also helped to preserve many archaic features in their folklore and folk belief. In wooded areas with many large and small rivers the Permian peoples still hunted and fished extensively almost to the present day. With the North Zyrians, hunting, along with reindeer breeding carried on in some places, was the most important source of income until the First World War. All this is reflected in the religious ideas and customs of these people whose religious situation till recently can be characterized as a double religion. The old pagan folk religion continued to live uninterrupted everywhere alongside the syncretistically-viewed Christian faith. The Permian peoples who cultivated their fields as their main source of income for more than three millennia, and whose folk religion contains very strong agrarian elements, saw in the sacred, cosmically powerful concerted action of heaven and earth the main source of fertility for plants, animals, and human beings. In the Permian languages the Heaven God is designated with words which also mean "heaven": Zyrian Jen, Votyak Inmar (from in, inm "heaven"). Since there are also etymo- logically corresponding instances in other Finnish languages for "heaven" and "Heaven God" (e.g. Estonian ilm "weather, world, heaven," and Finnish ilma; cf. also Ilmarinen, Kalevala hero of the Finno-Karelian folk literature - perhaps an old wind and weather god),4 philologists 4 Cf. Harva, Suomalaisten muinaisusko (Porvoo &amp; Helsinki, 1948), pp. 137 ff. 151</page><page sequence="5">IVAR PAULSON consider these words to be derivatives of a Finno-Permian root, that is, from the Finno-Permian linguistic period when, according to the lin- guistic and archaeological data, agriculture began to spread with the ancestors of this ethnic family.5 The close connection of the religion of the heaven with agriculture among all Finnish peoples has been emphasized by historians of religion. Thus, for instance, Uno Harva (Holmberg) writes with regard to the deities of the heaven and the air: "The worship of the Heaven God is more closely connected with agriculture, which more often than any other occupation raises its glance to the sky. That he is a god of agricul- ture is shown plainly by the fact that sacrifices are made to him chiefly that the fields may become fruitful."6 Until very recently the Votyaks have preserved many memories and living folk-religious ideas and cus- toms in their folk belief which refer to the Heaven God and his close connection to agriculture. However, the Zyrians have lost their old religion of the heaven almost completely, partly because of the minor role of the agrarian complex in their homeland which lies further north and is partially subpolar, and especially because of their early and thorough Christianization and subsequent Russianization.7 Inmar, the Heaven God of the Votyaks, has been worshipped partially as heaven itself thought of animatistically as a living being, partially as a personal being living in heaven. Memories of the former conception of the Heaven God have been retained, for instance, in expressions such as inmar zore "inmar [i.e. the heavens] rain" among others, or in the assertion of the Votyaks that they call "everything light that we see inmar," that is, they consider the day-sky as an outward form of the Heaven God.8 The Votyaks in the former district of Sarapul called the Heaven God, whom, as all Votyaks, they generally called Inmar, also simply "heaven" (in) as late as the end of the past century.9 And along with in and inmar (about "the heavenly one") the Votyaks also 6 Vuorela, Suomensukuiset kansat, p. 12. 6 Harva, Finno-ugric, Siberian, p. 219. 7 Short reports about the mythological position of the Zyrian Heaven God Jen in the cosmogonic myths (with dualistic creative activity of the god and the devil) are given by V.

Tura, Tat. Tangere.12 The Turkish-Tatar influence on the Votyak religion of the heavens is also expressed among other things in the fact that they sacrifice a horse to the Heaven God, a sacrifice which occurs infrequently among the Finnish peoples except for the Cheremis who have lived under the same foreign influence. In the great sacrificial ceremonies of the Votyaks this sacrifice offered to Inmar is a foreign and late feature.'3 These foreign components in the Votyak sacrifice to heaven, of course, can only prove that it was enriched through borrowed features. They cannot prove its foreign origin in general. As everywhere with the Altaic and Uralic peoples, in northern and middle Asia as well as in East Europe, the Votyaks sacrificed mainly white or at least light animals to the Heaven God, turned toward the east ("toward the day," i.e. the sun) during the sacrificial practice, and chose preferably elevated locations (hills) as the place of sacrifice. If the sacrifice was made in sacred groves (Voty. lud "grove"),14 those with deciduous trees ("light trees," birches among others) were preferred. The Votyaks called the sacrifice to heaven an "upwardly directed sacrifice" (vallan vandon) in contrast to the "down- wardly directed sacrifice" (ullan vandon) offered to chthonic natural beings, as well as to dead ancestors with black or dark sacrificial animals 10 Wichmann, loc. cit. 11 I.

These two types of sacrifices in which no burning of the sacrificial animals originally seems to have taken place, were, according to old accounts, also formerly known among the Zyrians. According to an account of Verescagin, the Votyaks in the former district of Sarapul still sacrificed to the Heaven God on hills in the manner described above as recently as the past century.15 In the case of the Permian peoples the worship of the Heaven God was very closely connected with agriculture. The Votyaks offered sac- rifices to Inmar mainly for the sake of the fertility of their fields because, according to their unanimous opinion, he fertilizes the soil and the field, as is said in an account of Ryckov from the eighteenth century.16 Because of this main function they also gave the Heaven God such epithets as "Creator" (kildis) and "Nourisher" (vordis). These often occur in sac- rifical prayers addressed to the Heaven God in which he is invoked, for instance, as the "Creator Inmar" or the "Nourisher Inmar."17 The worship of the Heaven God is confined mainly to the summer half of the year. It is reported that the Votyaks firmly believed that sacrifices to Inmar were meaningful only up to Pokrov day (October 1, O.S., which is a holiday of the Russian Orthodox Church), and after that date it was not worth the effort to make them any more.18 All this clearly shows the emphatically agrarian religious position of the Heaven God in the folk belief of the Votyaks; this, however, must not be under- stood to mean that his origin was connected with the beginning of agri- culture. One of the oldest written accounts of the Votyak worship of the Heaven God is contained in Ryckov's travel diary of the years 1769-1770. There it says: The central god Ilmer lives in heaven and has created everything. His feast is celebrated in the spring and takes place in the middle of the fields. Men as 15 G.

The sacrificial animals, horses, cows, sheep, or calves must be of a white color.19 Later on the Votyaks no longer adhered so strictly to the requirement of white sacrificial animals but also took animals of another light color for the sacrifice to heaven. However, these animals were not allowed to be black in any case; often, for instance, brown colts were used.20 Information about images of the Heaven God of the Votyaks is scarce and not very reliable. Kosurnikov has reported (1880) that the Votyaks supposedly kept images of Inmar in their houses, which are believed to have been made in an anthropomorphic shape, either from wood or dough, and kept in little wooden containers. The nature and the type of worship of these figures, however, caused Harva to remark that it was probably not the Heaven God at all who was represented but the house spirit (vorsud).21 The confusion might possibly have been brought about by the fact that the house spirit played a very large role in the religious and social life of the Votyaks and may be compared in impor- tance with the Heaven God.22 As is known, other North Eurasian peoples, among them those of the Finno-Ugric-Uralic linguistic family, also did not represent their Heaven Gods anywhere in images either. After the Christianization which, as indicated above, has always remained superficial and mixed with pagan elements (syncretistic in the sense of a "double religion"), the Votyaks identified Inmar more and more with the Christian God and begged his indulgence to a growing degree in all matters of life. However, the thought of his care for material welfare outweighed the spiritual and ethical functions of god. This fact becomes clear, for instance, from a communication of 1861 which appeared in the provincial paper of the former province of Vyatka: "Inmar is in their (the Votyaks) opinion only a good spirit who guards their life by giving them food and clothes but who does not concern himself with the relations existing between men." Harva, who quotes the communication, concludes from this that the Votyaks did not originally ascribe the function of watching over customs and manners to the Heaven God which, for instance, the dead (ancestors) fulfilled in 19 Ryckov, loc. cit. 20 Wichmann, "Tietoja votjakkien mytologiiasta," 26; Harva, Permalaisten, p. 170. 21 Harva, loc. cit. 22 Cf. A. Hamalainen, "Der vorgud-mudor-Kult der Wotjaken," Eurasia Septen- trionalia Antiqua, VI (1931). 155</page><page sequence="9">their folk belief.23 As the supreme owner and essence of the cosmic natural phenomena between heaven and earth, the Heaven God has remained distant and not pertinent for the social life of men. His main function was seen in the agrarian religious complex of ideas and cus- toms, above all in the furthering of the fertility of the fields, and thereby the fertility of animals as well as human beings. In addition to the fusion with the Christian god, Inmar was also iden- tified with Allah among the Votyaks that were influenced by Islam. This is indicated for instance by his name of budzim Inmar "great Inmar" (cf. Allah akbar "Allah is great," in Islam) which occurs frequently in the Votyak prayers following the pattern of the Islamic prayer ritual. We find evidence of the Christian influence in ideas such as Inmar-atai (I. - Father) and Inmar-anai (I. - Mother, i.e. the Godmother of the Russian Orthodox Church). In the sacrificial prayer of the Votyaks in the former district of Glazov their concept of the Trinity occurs as Inmar- kildisin-kuaz ("air, heaven," "donor") the Holy Ghost.24 The Christ figure has, however, also been conceived of as the assistant of the Heaven God, kiltsin-inmar ("Creator-I.") or alak-inmar ("Mediator-I.") and kaba-inmar ("Fate-I."). It is believed that he can determine the good and ill fortune of men by reporting their good and bad deeds to God. The Votyak word inmar also has the semantic meaning "God" in those compounds which designate the saints of the Orthodox Church, for instance Ilya-inmar (Elias) and Nikolai-inmar (St. Nikolai). The Zyrians use the epithet Jen ("God") with the same meaning for the Christian Saints.25 In addition to the Heaven God, the Votyaks also offered sacrifices to other heavenly deities in order to obtain fertility for their fields. Thus sacrifices were offered to the "Sun Mother" (sundi-mumi) and to the "Thunderstorm Mother" (gudiri-mumu) who, as heaven, were also con- ceived of as animated atmospheric natural beings (the sun and thun- derstorm) and which could be considered as hypostases of the Heaven God.26 23 Harva, Pernialaisten, p. 171.

In the Votyak prayers for the fertility of the fields it is often invoked together with the Heaven God Inmar as the "Earth Mother," muziem-mumi.27 The Votyaks imagined the earth itself to be an animated female being, the Earth Mother, and worshipped her especially in an agrarian religious connection (field sacrifices). Aside from the Earth Mother, the deity of the earth was also called "The Old Earth Lady," muziem-anai. According to one report the Old Earth Lady was even the "Central god of agriculture." The Votyaks assumed that the deity lived in the earth itself and therefore placed their offerings for her in its bowels. In the former district of Mamadys, some of them told Harva that the Earth Mother lives in earth mounds and therefore they did not like to dig in them.28 This and the fact that the deity of the earth in the imagination of the Votyaks does not have personal human-like features indicate her complete identity with the earth itself, precisely as was the case with the animatistic con- ception of heaven and the Heaven God. In the sacrificial prayers the deity of the earth is also addressed as mu-kiltsin, "Creator of the Earth," or mu-kiltsin-mumi "Mother Creator of the Earth." However, the sacrificial ritual is the same in all cases except for the name of the deity of the earth. Old Votyak sacrificial priests, therefore, also declared that "Creator of the Earth" and "Mother Creator of the Earth" are nothing else than "Earth Mother."29 The sacrifice to the earth may only be offered in the summer half of the year because "the earth sleeps afterwards and can no longer receive any sacrifices."30 This conception determined by the agrarian cycle thus corresponds exactly to the one described in connection with the sacrifice offered to heaven. In the sacrifice to the earth, however, only black or dark sacrificial animals are used; "animals of the color of the earth," 27 Wichmann, "Tietoja votjakkien mytologiiasta," 26; Harva, Permalaisten, pp. 177 ff. 28 Harva, Permalaisten, p. 177. 29 Wichmann,"Tietoja votjakkien mytologiiasta," 7, 26 f.; Harva, Permalaisten, p. 178. 30 Harva, loc. cit. Cf. also the same concept with regard to heaven as above. 157</page><page sequence="11">as the Votyaks say themselves. Their bones were put in the earth after the sacrificial meat had been eaten by the participants in the sacrifice. The blood of the sacrificial animals was conducted to holes in the earth which were dug out specifically for this purpose and in which at times also parts of the meat and the intestines of the animal were buried together with the bones. Most frequently black oxen and sheep are mentioned in the accounts as the sacrificial animals for the earth. Judging from some data, horses were never offered to the Earth Mother. Spring, the period of the beginning of the work in the fields, is mentioned most frequently as a suitable time for offering sacrifices to the earth.31 In 1854 a Votyak prayer was recorded which was said during a spring sacrifice to the earth in the former district of Glazov and which should be typical for the prayers at the sacrifices to the earth: "O Earth Mother, we thank you, that you have nourished us during the past year. Be gen- erous now, too, with your gifts and also make grain for us this summer."32 The great importance of the earth deity for agriculture and her central role in the agrarian religion is thus summarized in a few words. Aside from fertility for the fields, one also expected good health from the earth deity. Harva has recorded a Votyak tradition in the former district of Birsk according to which mu-kiltsin, "Creator of the Earth," becomes angry when men dig and plow in the ground and she there- fore sends them diseases. At other places the illness coming from the earth, which is considered as a punishment of men by the earth, is known by the name of "Earth Creator Disease" (mu-kiltsin-miz) and clings to the sick person as a particularly disastrous power of revenge.33 A power which is beneficent to men, on the other hand, is the "Earth Luck" (mu-sud) which brings about the fertility of the fields. The Zyrians believe that one can steal the Earth Luck from another man's field if one has not enough of it oneself. The thief secretly sneaks to the field of the more fortunate neighbor, takes a handful of earth, and while doing this says "Good luck, follow me, give me a good harvest."34 Just as with the earth deity, the "Earth Luck" has been imagined concretely as an impersonal power in the earth itself. 31 Wichmann, "Tietoja votjakkien mytologiiasta," 25 ff.; Harva, Permalaisten, pp. 177 f. 32 Harva, Permalaisten, p. 179. 33 Ibid., p. 178. 34 V.

When Harva visited the Votyaks before the First World War these conceptions were still known only by the eastern Votyaks. In the remaining Votyak area the "Creator of the Grain" (du- kiltsin) was worshipped instead as the protecting deity of the field and the grain. At the time of the great agrarian ceremonies (field sacrifices) in the spring, summer, and fall, white sheep, geese, or ducks were offered to him in the common sacrificial fire.35 We do not hear anything about the outer shape of the "Creator of the Grain"; however, we do know some things about those of the "Field Soul" and the "Grain Soul." The latter has been partially considered as the animated grain itself (like the earth as earth deity and the heaven as heaven deity). For instance, the farmer fills a wooden container with grain and addresses his prayer to it in order to obtain a good harvest.36 However, Harva was also able to observe that the Votyaks thought of the "Grain Soul" as having the form of a white butterfly. If a field did not yield a good crop any more, then they believed that the "Grain Soul" had vanished from it. The magician thereupon began searching for the vanished "Grain Soul." This ceremony was called "Searching for the Grain Soul" (du-urt-kuton). Once the "Grain Soul" was discovered somewhere in the forest or in the field with the help of the magician, it (i.e. the white butterfly) was wrapped carefully in a white cloth and was brought back to the field and freed there. After this, so it was believed, the field would thrive again and bear rich crops.37 In order to be sure of a good hay harvest the Votyaks offered sacrifices every spring "in honor of the grass." A bowl of potatoes was taken to a spot where the young grass first appeared after ice and snow had melted. While doing this a prayer was said to the Heaven God Inmar asking for a good hay harvest. The Votyaks of Glazov even sacrificed a white ox on this occasion.38 An ox and a sheep were also offered as a sacrifice at the time the cattle were first taken out to the pastures in the spring.

As everywhere in northeastern Europe, the cultivation of the fields and cattle breeding go hand in hand in the agricultural economy of the Permian peoples.40 Aside from these natural deities of the earth and heaven which played a great agrarian-religious role in the agricultural economy of the Permian peoples and who must be considered as autochthonous and deeply rooted in the old folk religion, there are other supernatural beings, usually demonized natural beings of different forms and origins, that were bor- rowed from their neighbors, which continued to exist in folk belief for a long time. One example would be Plezniitsa of the Zyrians (cf. Russian poludnitsa, a malefic "noon goddess") who lives, according to the conception of the Zyrians, in the rye field and punishes anyone severely who damages the rye ears while they are in bloom, or who goes into the rye field.41 According to other reports Peleznitsa can also live in the water and appears in this connection as an evil nymph (compare with Russian Rusalka and other demonized nature or water spirits).42 IV The Nordic forest with its coniferous trees and birches has played with all Finnish peoples an ecologically dominating role as a natural back- ground for their folk culture, as well as their folk religion. Hunting and fishing also continued to exist strongly as economic and spiritual factors with the Permian peoples in their recent folk culture either in that they gave the farmer an additional source of food, or that they were followed 39 Wichmann, "Tietoja," p. 27. 40 See for instance Manninen, Die finnisch-ugrischen Volker, pp. 244 ff. 41 Nalimov, Zagrobnyj, p. 21; and Nalimov, "Zur Frage nach den urspriinglichen Be- ziehungen der Geschlechter bei den Syrjanen," Journal de la Societe Finno-ougrienne, 25:4 (Helsinki, 1908), 14; Fuchs, "Eine Studienreise zu den Syrjanen," 243; Harva, Permalaisten, p. 175. 42 Cf.

Aside from this, the wilderness as the outer region did not lose its importance for the cultivator of the soil and breeder of cattle for a long time. The forest as an outer region filled with a strange and sinister power sur- rounded the fields which had been wrested away from wild nature and made arable through hard work. The farmer led his cattle into the forest to the summer pasture, and for this reason both the cultivation of the fields, and especially the primitive way of pasturing the cattle in the forest from spring until late in the fall, were intimately connected with the religious conceptions and customs which developed from forest and game. From the viewpoint of religious phenomenology it can be established that one or the other conceptual element predominates in the forest spirit and game spirit belief,43 although the experiences of power incited by forest and game must often have been a holistic complex including forest and game in homogenous hierophanies and theophanies. With the Finnish peoples in northeastern Europe, who for the most part have cultivated their fields for a long time as their main source of income, the religious conceptions and customs in the sphere of forest culture seem to have grown more out of the experiences inspired by the forest itself than those coming from the game, that is, the wild beasts of the forest. The Finnish peoples therefore basically provide a different case than that of the purely hunting peoples in North Eurasia (especially Siberia) where one finds a richly differentiated world of conceptions of the various protecting spirits and deities of the game.44 In the folk belief of the Permian peoples, as with the other rural Finnish linguistic relatives in general, the forest spirit, the central figure of their forest belief and game belief, was repeatedly referred to simply as "forest." The forest as such is conceived as an animated being that is endowed with a will, activity, 43 Paulson, Schutzgeister und Gottheiten des Wildes (der Jagdtiere und Fische) in Nordeurasien (= Acta Universitatis Stockholmiensis, Stockholm Studies in Comparative Religion, 2) (Stockholm, 1961); "Wald- und Wildgeister im Volksglauben der fin- nischen Volker," Zeitschrift fur Volkskunde, 57:1 (Stuttgart, 1961); and "Wildgeist- vorstellungen in Nordeurasien," Paideuma, 8:2 (Wiesbaden, 1962); and Paulson, "The Animal Guardian: a critical and synthetic review," "History of Religions - An Inter- national Journal for Comparative Historical Studies, Vol. 3, No. 2 (Chicago, 1964), 202-219. 44 Paulson, Schutzgeister und Gottheiten, pp. 48 if., 115 ff., and 224 if.

In the following pages we can describe only briefly the religious concep- tions and customs of the Permian peoples which revolve around the forest and game. Information about the forest spirit, or the various forest spirits, in the folk belief of the Zyrians is found in the works of a number of Russian, Hungarian, and Finnish authors who dealt both with the figure of the forest spirit and the religious customs and conceptions grouped around it.45 The Zyrians usually call the forest spirit vorsa "forest," or vorsa- mort "Forest Man" (also lesak-mort, from Russ. les "forest," and Zyr. mort "man"). However, since they were afraid of saying the proper name of the forest spirit aloud, they also gave him many pseudonyms, for example djadja (Russ. "uncle"). The Zyrians imagine the forest spirit in human form, as his name shows. He is supposed to have his farm and his family in the forest and be very tall, taller than the tallest trees; for this reason he is sometimes also called kuz djadja "big uncle." However, the forest spirit can also manifest himself in a violent whirl- wind which rages in the forest and does harm to human beings as well as the cattle. Since the forest spirit likes to indulge in love adventures he is greatly feared by the women. Generally, however, the Zyrians consider the forest spirit to be a good creature who can help human beings in various situations. He shows the paths through the wilderness to the hunter who is on good terms with him. At times he is said to come to the campfires of the hunters to warm himself there. It is also he who drives the game into the traps and snares of the hunter. In return, at times the Zyrian hunters offer small sacrifices to the forest spirit, for instance in the form of a little tobacco which is placed on a tree stump in the forest, for the Zyrians and some other North Eurasian peoples assume that the forest spirit loves tobacco. However, there are also other types of sacrifices for the forest spirit, for instance the fur of a squirrel 45 Smirnov, "Permjaki," Izvestija Obscestva Archeologii, Istorii i Etnografii pri Kazanskom Universitete, 8:2, 268 if.; N.

The Zyrian forest spirit is wor- shipped as an animal guardian, for the sake of good hunting, as well as the protector of the herds in the forest who is able to guard the cattle from the wild beasts such as wolves and bears. In both functions his position as "Master of the Forest Animals" is shown.46 Among the wild beasts of the forest the Zyrians as well as the Votyaks honor the bear in particular. They believe that the bear is a creature that resembles human beings but is smarter and stronger. He can under- stand the language of human beings but is not able to speak himself. One is not to call the bear by his proper name - just as in the case of the forest spirit - but by various pseudonyms. Therefore he is often called, for example, "Old Man." When one meets a bear in the forest one is supposed to bare one's head and kneel down before him since he is the "Lord of the Forest."47 It is generally believed by the Permian peoples that the bear does not harm you if you show the proper respect. Sup- posedly, however, the bear recognizes his enemies even after he is dead and takes revenge on them. Therefore one is not allowed to laugh and joke in the presence of a killed and skinned bear. Actual bear ceremonies, as they have been lavishly staged by the Ob-Ugrian peoples in North- western Siberia (Ostyaks and Voguls) as well as by the old Finns and Lapps, nevertheless are not definitely known to have been practiced by the Permian peoples.48 Among the various North Eurasian peoples the position of the bear as "Lord of the Forest" reminds us greatly of the close connections of this important animal of the Nordic forests with the game spirit.49 The view that the killed bear may take revenge is probably based on the conception of a surviving soul of the animal.50 Thus the belief of the Votyaks and Zyrians in the forest spirit and animal guardian has retained a central religious motif from the hunting stage. The hunter's bone ritual with the killed game is also connected with the belief that the soul survives the dead animal; the Zyrian hunters buried bones and skulls of the animals they had killed on platforms in the forest "because otherwise these animals would have turned into evil spirits 46 Paulson, Schutzgeister und Gottheiten, pp. 124 ff. 47 Harva, Permalaisten, p. 156. 48 Harva, Finno-ugric, Siberian, pp. 83 ff. 49 Cf.

His appearance is described by the Votyaks as that of a human being. However, he is said to have only one eye (Polyphemus motif). The Votyaks also attribute to the forest spirit the ability to make himself smaller or larger according to his own will. However, it is believed that he cannot make himself smaller than the smallest human being. As a rule he was considered to be as tall as the tallest trees in the forest. Therefore he has also been called "Big Uncle" (bidzim nuna) in places. The forest is where he lives with his great wealth in cattle, gold, and silver. He can move invisibly from place to place as a whirlwind. According to the conception of the Votyaks and Zyrians the forest spirits celebrate their wedding twice a year. Then the wind rages in the forest and throws strong trees over. As a whirlwind the forest spirit is able to do much harm to human beings and the cattle in the forest, lead them astray, and destroy them. In general, however, the Votyaks considered the forest spirit to be a very strong but also stupid creature, and he was therefore not greatly to be feared. Frequently he was also able to be of much benefit to men. He sent game to the hunter and protected herds from wild beasts.52 The Votyak forest spirit is thus, as the Zyrian one, a game spirit, a "Master of the Wild Beasts." In this function he occasionally received small sacrifices from the Votyak hunters. Nevertheless, as time went by they became smaller and smaller, as the Votyaks had said themselves before the First World War. The forests in their region had at that time been greatly reduced, and with it the importance of the forest culture and of huntsmanship. As late as 1733, however, Gmelin describes hunting as the second major trade next to the cultivation of the fields in some areas of settlement of the Votyaks. Aside from the smaller forest animals, the Votyaks at that time are said to have often hunted large game (bears, wolves, and foxes) in many cases.53 51 Nalimov, Zagrobnyj mir po verovanijam zyrjan, pp. 4, 13.

All hunters who were present took part in it. Bread, brandy, an ox, or a ram are mentioned as sacrificial gifts. Through these animal sacrifices the importance of the forest sacrifice is revealed. These offerings to the forest spirit were formerly performed by several sacrificial officials together: there were leaders in prayer, butchers, and cooks. Their ceremonies were similar to the great field sacrifices and the sacrifices in the sacred grove (lud). Later on, however, the individual was contented in most cases with placing a piece of bread for the forest spirit on the branches of a tree.54 A typical prayer to the forest spirit reads as fol- lows: "Give me, Lord of the Forest, forest animals, squirrels, foxes, and bears. Give me also bees, drive them into my hives. If you do it, I will give you gifts."55 The mentioning of the bees in this prayer points to the role of the forest spirit with regard to the antiquated bee-culture formerly pursued so actively by the Votyaks (and the Volga-Finnic peoples as well as their neighbors).56 In some places the forest spirit was offered sacrifices twice a year, in the spring and the fall. In the spring a gray sheep and a goose were slain, and at the same time prayers were said asking that there not be too strong a wind in the summer (cf. the conception about the forest spirits as whirlwinds). The fall sacrifice was aimed at good game as we have already heard.57 Thus the Permian peoples considered the forest itself to be an animated creature endowed with a supernatural power, but they also personified it in the anthropomorphically imagined figure of the forest spirit.58 As time went by this latter view came more and more under the influence of the Russian conception of the forest spirit where this being (Russ. lesij) often appears as a demonized goblin.59 Through this influence as 54 N.

In connection with this process the forest sacrifices naturally also de- creased. Along with the forest spirit as the central figure of the forest belief, the Permian tradition, and particularly the Votyak tradition, has retained a number of other forest creatures - terrifying as well as impish figures of the wilderness, which may have been partly borrowed from their neigh- bors (Russians and Tatars) and which did not play a great religious role. As goblins who led people astray in the forest these creatures "hid" human beings in the forest, terrified those who gathered berries and mushrooms, and did other mischief, especially to women and children.60 v In addition to the experiences of power connected with the forest and the game, the innumerable inland waters of the land, above all the big and small rivers which cross the northeastern forest zone, were ecotypical central points of their religious conceptions and customs. Economic ethnology characterized the oldest culture of the Finno-Ugric-Uralic peoples as a culture of fishermen and hunters. The prehistoric findings allow us to place this cultural phase in the middle Stone Age (Mesoli- thicum),6' when the ancestors of all later peoples of this linguistic com- munity must have been occupied with hunting and fishing to the same extent. In a somewhat later phase of development of their culture, in the later Stone Age (Neolithicum), fishing even seems to have predo- dominated over hunting, as the archaeological evidence as well as the historical linguistic material (from the Finno-Ugric period) shows.62 Even in the most recent past the eastern neighbors and linguistic relatives of the Permian peoples, the Ob-Ugrian peoples, earned their livelihood in large part by fishing; inland fishing in the large northwestern rivers 60 Wichmann, "Tietoja votjakkien mytologiiasta," 9 f.; Harva, Permalaisten, pp. 154 iff. 61 Indreko, Origin and area of settlement of the Fenno-Ugrian peoples; Vuorela, Suomensukuiset kansat, pp. 10 ff. 62 Setala, Suomen suku, I, 120 ff.; Vuorela, Suomensukuiset kansat, pp. 10 ff. 166</page><page sequence="20">OUTLINE OF PERMIAN FOLK RELIGION of Siberia provided the most important source of their income.63 But also the rural Finnish peoples, not the least among them the Permian peoples in northeastern Europe, intensively pursued fishing everywhere as an additional source of income just a short time ago. In some places professional fishermen among them still exist today. Naturally all this has also had an influence on the folk belief of these peoples. Just as with the religious conceptions and customs which grew out of the contact with forest and game, there is ample evidence with regard to the Permian peoples that they were aware of supernatural power incited by the water and the fish. In the total picture of their folk religion they form a more or less closed complex which we shall describe here briefly. Just as the forest spirit was considered the owner of the forest animals so was the water spirit thought of as the owner of the fish. With the Zyrians the most frequent name of the water spirit is kul or va-kul "Water-kul"; in addition, according to a few data, the female water spirit in particular is called vais or vasa.64 The water spirit appears in the Zyrian folk tradition as a long-haired, human-like being and is thought of as part male and part female. At times he also appears in the form of a fish, usually a large pike, which points to his close connec- tion with these fish. Pike-shaped water spirits are, however, also known by the neighboring peoples of the Zyrians and Votyaks, above all the Russians.65 Among the Zyrians it is told, for instance, that once some fishermen wounded a large, long pike that had appeared in the mill- brook with their fishing fork, and as a result the vais-kul, or water spirit, came at night in order to complain on account of his son.66 In Nalimov's unpublished collections a water spirit (kul-pijan) is mentioned who could speak and had long white hair.67 Thus the pike is conceived of by the Zyrians partially as the son of the water spirit and partially as a form or manifestation of the water spirit himself. 63 Manninen, Die finnisch-ugrischen Volker, pp. 321 ff. 64 Harva, Die Wassergottheiten der finnisch-ugrischen Volker (= Memoires de la Societe Finno-ougrienne, 32) (Helwinki, 1913), pp. 96ff.; Harva, Permalaisten, pp. 161 iff.

A comparison with the Russian water spirit (vodjanoj) shows that the Zyrian water spirit, and that of the neighboring Finnish peoples in Russia, have borrowed many features from him, including the demonic ones.69 Harva, who has devoted a detailed monograph to the water spirits of the Finno-Ugric peoples, remarks that with these peoples the water spirit was not necessarily an evil being. This is proven above all by the fact that it is worthwhile to offer him sacrifices. In answer to the question of the Russian researcher Z;akov, as to whether he was not afraid of the water spirit, an old Zyrian once said that the water spirit did not bother him while fishing if he gave it bread.70 At another place Zakov reports that the water spirit gives fish and allows humans to travel safely on the rivers if he is worshipped with sacrifices.71 From the notes of the Finnish researcher Wichmann it can be seen that the Zyrians offered butter and bread to the lake spirit, that is, the local water spirit of a certain lake, so that he might give them fish. While fishing one also had to be careful not to say ugly words because this annoyed the water spirit, and he would grasp the nets so firmly in his anger that the fishermen could not move them from the spot.72 All this indicates the role of the water spirit as the owner of the fish and sponsor of fishing. In addition to worshiping the spirits that are thought of as persons which live in the water, the Zyrians at times also turned to the water itself with sacrifices and prayers. "However, whenever sacrifices are made to the water, it cannot be determined with certainty whether it is a matter of worship of the water itself or of the spirit living in the water," Harva remarks.73 Nalimov reports that the Zyrians would sacrifice money to 68 Ibid., pp. 267 ff.; Paulson, Die Wassergeister als Schutzwesen der Fische im Volks- glauben der finnisch-ugrischen Volker (= Studies in Estonian Language and Poetry) (Stockholm, 1965). 69 Harva, Die Wassergottheiten der finnisch-ugrischen Volker, pp. 100 f., 104 f. 70 Zakov, Na severe, v poiskach za Pamom Burmortom (St. Peterburg, 1905), p. 55. 71 Zakov, "Jazyceskoe mirosozercanie zyrjan," p. 73. 72 Wichmann, "Tietoja votjakkien mytologiiasta," pp. 10 f.; Harva, Permalaisten, p. 102. 73 Harva, Die Wassergottheiten, p. 110. 168</page><page sequence="22">OUTLINE OF PERMIAN FOLK RELIGION the water before every fishing season, of which he enumerates five (spring, summer, fall, late fall, and early spring). Some Zyrians, moreover, also made a sacrifice every day during the fishing season, if not with money then with bread.74 Furthermore, a very general custom was to throw the first fish caught back into the water (primitial sacrifice) and if it were caught again to conclude that the water did not want any gift and therefore did not want to give any fish either.75 According to Zakov the Zyrians at the Vym river prepared a butter sandwich when they went fishing and threw it into the water as a sacrifice while saying, "Mother (Russ. matuska) Vorik-va (the Zyrian name of the Vym river) carry us safely, care for us, protect us, and give us many fish, our whole boat full."76 In addition to the anthropomorphically conceived water spirit the Zyrians also imagined water itself, which was considered to be animated, as female beings, as "Mothers" of the individual rivers and lakes, and offered sacrifices to them for various reasons, among others for the sake of good fishing. Harva speaks of a "deity developed from the worship of the water itself," although not clearly defined, which he found among the Zyrians, and also various other Finnic peoples.77 From the point of view of religious phenomenology one could also represent this animatistic conception of nature which we described above for the heaven, the earth, and the forest as a parallel phenomenon to the animatistic concepts of personal natural beings with human-like figures. However, it will hardly ever be possible for the history of religion to prove a satis- factory genetic or historic relationship between the two.78 The water spirit generally known in the entire area of settlement of the Votyaks is vu-murt "Water Man" who is mentioned as early as the eighteenth century by Georgi.79 As is clear from his name, we are con- cerned here with a human-like being who according to the Votyak traditional belief resides by preference in deep waters, large rivers, and lakes, but also in small brooks and particularly in mill brooks.80 He is 74 Harva, loc. cit. 75 Harva, loc. cit. 76 Zakov, "Jazyceskoe mirosozercanie zyrjan," p. 72. 77 Harva, Die Wassergottheiten, p. 113. 78 Cf.

The Votyak water spirit may, however, also appear as a fish. According to Verescagin it was formerly believed that at times the water spirit turned into a pike; the fishermen are said to have seen him often in that form when spearing fish. The water spirit pike is distinguished from other pikes by the fact that it is large in size and that while sleeping it keeps its head turned toward the shore, in contrast to ordinary pikes. If it is wounded by the fishermen some kind of misfortune will occur.81 The pike shape of the water spirit, which we have already encountered among the Zyrians, returns here and confirms the close connection of the water spirit with the fish in the folk belief of the Permian peoples (as well as their neigh- bors). The Votyak conception of the water spirit, like that of the Zyrian, shows many points of contact with the water spirit of the Russians.82 In the southern and eastern regions of the Votyaks, on the other hand, the conceptions of the water spirit were also influenced by their Turkish- Tatar neighbors. The Eastern Votyak concept of the water-spirit vu- murt, as well as vu-kuzo "Water Lord," probably shows Turkish-Tatar influence.83 The water spirit is at the same time lord of the fish and water birds, as we shall see presently. Although the water spirit of the Votyaks - similar to the Zyrian and Russian water spirits with whom it has many characteristics in com- mon - is an evil and feared being rather than a good one, it is still worth- while to offer it sacrifices and worship because when in a friendly mood it can also be of benefit to humans. It can help the fisherman, for in- stance, by driving the fish into his net, the hunter by sending water birds to him, and the farmer by protecting his poultry in the water.84 Thus sacrifices to the water spirit were customary up until most recent times in most Votyak areas. According to Verescagin, sacrifices were made to the water spirit for the sake of a rich catch.85 In his previously men- tioned study, Harva summarizes the data about the sacrifices by the Votyaks to the water spirit in the statement that sacrifices were made to 81 Buch, Die Wotjaken, p. 604; Verescagin, "Votjaki Sosnovskago kraja," 77 f. 82 Harva, Die Wassergottheiten, pp. 66 f.

In addition to sacrificing to the spirit who lives in the water, the Vot- yaks, just like the Zyrians, also turn to the water itself. Often both the "Mother" of the respective waters (i.e., the animatistically personified water itself, as well as the water spirit with a human-like figure) are in- voked in the same prayer. However, there are sacrificial practices which refer exclusively to a river or a lake as such, without making mention of the water spirit at all.87 Such sacrificial practices aim at rain and at fertility of the fields, humans, and animals. In the case of illnesses, sacrifices were made to the water itself, partially because it was assumed that the illnesses came from the water (cf. illnesses from the earth, as described above), and partially because the water was considered a healing and fertilizing element ("Water of Life").88 Wichmann has written down a prayer of the Votyaks which asks the river itself for fish: "My mother (Russ. matuska) Ibit (Ibit River), give us of your fish!"89 Wichmann reported still another prayer which was said before catching fish in which the river or the water itself was also invoked at the same time as the personal water spirit: "My mother Tsuptsi (Tsuptsi river!) Do not be angry! I have come to fish. My vu- murt! Here I give you my bread crust. Give me a great big fish! The far ones bring closer, bring them all the way to shore!

Do not scoff at our nets, our drum nets and drag nets, my vu-murt!"90 From this we can see how varying the conceptions of the mighty water (river) on the one hand and of the water spirit with a human form and strength on the other can be. The animatistic and animistic conceptions of nature go hand in hand against the ecotypical background of the special dominance of an interest (here of the fishermen), hence they become of immediate concern for the folk religion.91 86 Harva, Die Wassergottheiten, p. 73. 87 Ibid., p. 74. 88 Ibid., p. 83. 89 Wichmann, "Wotjakische Sprachproben," I-II, Journal de la Societe Finno- ougrienne, XI (1893), p. 64. 90 Wichmann, op. cit., pp. 163 f. 91 Cf.

They can be regarded as his inner living circle to which he feels himself most closely attached in his life. The sanctification of house and home, of the human dwelling and its nearest surroundings with the farm buildings, is strongly reflected in religious ideas of all Finnic peoples, and in customs and manners which can be summarized and represented as house cult.92 In the living rooms of the farmhouses the sacredness of the building is concentrated in the so-called sacred rear corner. In the case of the orthodox population the image of the saint (Russ. ikona, obraz) hangs there. In the death ritual as well as in the ancestor cult, in the entire life cycle of the human being, as well as in the agrarian rites in the rural calendar, this place plays an important role as the gathering place for worshiping for all orthodox peoples.93 All Finnic peoples in East Russia, including the Permian groups, worshipped an anthropomorphic house spirit which at times reminds us greatly of the corresponding spirit of the Russians (domovoj),94 but which also has other features that are autochthonously peculiar to the folk religion of these peoples. The close relationship between the build- ing and its protecting spirit indicates that the figure of the house spirit originally cannot have belonged so exclusively to the death cult as dif- ferent researchers formerly believed, but that it must represent a super- natural conception of its own in the house and family cult.95 The Votyaks call the house spirit ruling in their homes korka-murt ("House Man") or korka-kuzu ("House Lord" or "House Ruler"). According to their view he resides under the floor and rarely appears. 92 Harva, Finno-ugric, Siberian, pp. 113 if., 159 ff.; G.

In his function and form the house spirit reminds us vividly of the conceptions of doubles of the human being that have grown out of the conception of free souls.96 Otherwise the Votyak considers the house spirit a good helpful being who protects his house and its inhabi- tants from foreign spirits and may aid the household in various ways, such as by finishing at night the spinning work of the women that did not get completed during the day. But when the spirit is annoyed he bothers the sleeping people by causing nightmares and he likes to ex- change small children for changelings. The latter instances in the Votyak conception of the house spirit lead us to assume that he was not only conceived in a masculine shape, but also in a feminine form.97 The cult of the Votyak house spirit includes various ritual practices, above all sacrifices. Reconciliation sacrifices - usually the slaying of a black sheep - are offered to the house spirit in the cellar where he is believed to reside. In the fall after the work in the field is completed he is likewise offered sacrifices, but then a goose or a duck or a little porridge (perhaps as a primitial sacrifice of the new harvest). Sacrifices have also been made to the house spirit in order to obtain luck with sheep, as generally was done in various matters of the management and household. Above all he is worshipped when moving into a new home. Such cele- brations of moving have been called "House-marriages" (korka-suan), which is reminiscent of the old hut cult which we will describe below.98 In addition to the house spirit the Votyaks also have various farm spirits: the "Lord of the Cattle-shed" (gid-kuzo), the "Bathhouse Man" (muntso-murt) or "Bathhouse Lord" (mun[so-kuzo), and the "Grain-kiln Man" (obin-murt), among others. Every building of the farm has its protecting spirit who is responsible for it and also for the work or manage- ment connected with it.99 Thus it is a matter of functional owners of cult places which - perhaps following the model of the Russian folk 96 For the concept of the soul among the Permian peoples see Paulson, Die primi- tiven Seelenvorstellungen der nordeurasischen Volker (Stockholm, 1958), pp. 69 ff., 75 ff.; for the free-soul as the "double," Ibid., pp. 304 ff. 97 Cf.

The "Lord of the Cattle-shed" is imagined by the Votyaks as a small old man who tends and protects the animals in the shed, especially the horses. However, when he is somehow annoyed he can also bother the animals, for instance, by riding the horses all through the night as a nightmare so that they are completely exhausted in the morning. His cult practices with other sacrifices, among them slaying sacrifices, were celebrated in the spring when the cattle were driven to the summer pas- ture.101 The "Bathhouse Man" dwells in the dark corner of the bath- house and - in contrast to the house and farm spirits dealt with up till now - is a thoroughly evil being who likes to play tricks on those taking a bath. He is hardly ever worshipped in a cult.102 The protecting spirit of the grain-kiln is addressed by the Votyaks mainly in the fall at the beginning of threshing, by sacrificing a sheep, a goose, or a duck to him in order that he will protect the kiln from fire hazards and further the work there.103 The Zyrians had similar house and farm spirits who, however, under the even stronger influence of Russian folk belief had even received Russian names in some parts; for instance, they called the house spirit susetka which is reminiscent of a surname of the Russian house spirit (domovoj), etc. But their general shape and functions as well as the cult rites performed for them are the same with the Zyrian house and farm spirits as with the Votyaks.104 The antiquated so-called hut cult is distinguished from the house cult mentioned above. The Votyaks retained this cult for a long time to- gether with their Volga-Finnic linguistic relatives and southern neigh- bors, the Cheremis, while it has fallen into oblivion with the Zyrians. At this place we can only touch briefly on the interestingly rich, archaic hut cult because its complex nature requires a treatment of its own for the Votyaks and the Cheremis together.105 100 Cf.

In connection with the house and family cult and also village and clan cult, they served as important shrines. The researchers agree that they were formerly dwel- lings and can be considered as the intermediary link or intermediate stage between the primitive tent constructions of the original nomadic way of life and the later firmly constructed farm dwellings.'06 Just a very short time ago they were still used as summer residences in some places. Their furnishings are simple and correspond to these functions. The part of the room at the rear wall which was used not only for house- hold purposes but also for the purpose of ritual deserves special atten- tion. As late as the beginning of our century at the rear wall in Votyak huts a stand made of boards was found, which formerly served as the cult place of the hut spirit vorsud (also sudvordis or vordis sud from vordini "nourish, bring up, support," and sud "prosperity"; thus approx- imately "prosperity furthering growth" or "supporter of the prosperity" - or "giver of prosperity of the household"), 107 but which was used later merely as a place for storing kitchen dishes and dining dishes. The Votyaks also gave the hut spirit the name of mudor (Zyrian mudor "ground, flour"; cf. Lapp madder and Finnish mantere or manner "earth")108 which refers to the conception of a protecting being of the hut which is connected with the ground and furthers the prosperity of the household. The hut spirit was usually imagined anthropomorphically, at times, however, also theriomorphically (e.g., as a bird). There are no clear reports about its sex; it mostly seems as though it is a masculine being, but some cult practices lead us to think that it was a feminine figure.109 The cult practices in the sacrificial huts show a very close social in- trionalia Antiqua, 6 (Helsinki, 1931); Harva, Der Ursprung des kuola-Kultes bei den Wotjaken (= Finnisch-ugrische Forschungen, 22) (Helsinki, 1934); Rank, Die Heilige Hinterecke, pp. 87 if.; Harva, Permalaisten, pp. 55 ff. 106 See, for instance, A.

It is a house cult confined to the shrines (huts) of the family and clan which were used in former times as dwellings and later on as annexes to the house- hold and as cult buildings. The offerings to the hut spirit were placed most of the time unburnt on the previously mentioned stand in the rear sacred corner, which was considered both as a "house altar" and as an abode of the hut spirit. The Votyaks referred to it directly as "the seat of the hut spirit" (pukon mudor) or even as mudor or vorsud, i.e. the spirit itself.110 The latter name may be due to the fact that the figures of the hut spirit which were presumably kept on this stand at one time dis- appeared as time went by, while the stand itself took their place in peop- le's imagination. Up until the last, branches of the fir tree, linden, or birch which were also called "hut spirit" by the Cheremis were still placed on this stand. Most of the time, however, a container (box) stood on these branches which was likewise called "hut spirit" (mudor or vorsud) by the Votyaks.111 These containers in which probably at one time idols of the hut spirit were kept served later on as sacrificial containers in which food leftovers, bones, pieces of fur, pieces of cloth, and coins were laid.112 The sacrificial practices in the huts took place at the most important turning points of the agrarian economic year: in the spring, midsummer, and fall. In addition to this, sacrifices were sometimes made on different occasions, especially in the case of illnesses which were attributed to the anger of the hut spirit.113 However, the economic functions of the hut spirit seem to be more deeply rooted in the customs connected with the sacrificial huts than the medical ones. In the prayers addressed to the hut spirit during the sacrifices most wish for a good harvest, protec- tion for the cattle and the bees, but also prosperity and health for the people.114 According to Harva's view, the Votyak-Cheremis hut cult and its 110 Rank, Die heilige Hinterecke, pp. 92 f. 1 Hamalainen, "Der vorsud-mudor-Kult," pp. 70 ff.

It is firmly rooted in the clan order of these peoples who were formerly divided in exogamous patrilineal clans."8 The organization of the hut cult according to clans is shown most clearly in the fact that every clan has its own clan hut which was at the same time a uniting symbol in social life. The Votyak clans were named directly after the corresponding sacrificial huts, and the term vorsud was identified with "family" or "suc- cession of families."119 Every clan worshipped its own protecting spirit under this name. The house cult was at the same time a family and clan cult. The members who had parted from the family or clan, sons as well as daughters, remained in close ritual dependence upon the sac- rificial hut of their family. Even after they either established their own sacrificial hut (men with a new household of their own) or lived in the sphere of another family's sacrificial hut (married women) they sac- rificed occasionally in the hut of their old family.120 Since the Votyak villages in older times in many cases were clan vil- lages, that is, the inhabitants were members of a large family or clan, there were in many instances so-called sacrificial huts of the village ("large huts"). In addition the individual farms could also have their "small huts" which were inferior to the village hut in rank and impor- 115 Ibid., pp. 134 f.; Harva, "Der Ursprung des kuola-Kultes." 116 Cf.

The sacrificial rites connected with a smaller family circle were per- formed in the small family huts, while more important acts which con- cerned the interest of the entire village were performed in the common village shrine of the clan. These could last for several days and involve abundant slaying sacrifices.121 On his trip in the eighteenth century Georgi was able to watch such sacrificial feasts of the Votyaks at the time of Easter. Men and women gathered in great numbers after having first washed themselves in the bathhouse because the feast required ritual cleanliness. Each one brought offerings which were handed over to the administrator of the village shrine. After the sacrificial meat was cooked, the sacrificial priest put parts of it, together with beer, on the cult stand at the rear wall of the hut where green branches were spread out. While doing this he begged vorsud for prosperity, health, many children, and protection of the cattle, bread, and honey for the entire village.122 Later on slaying sacrifices, especially in the individual family huts, became rare; most of the time one was contented with sacrifices of food (such as bread, porridge, beverage) and sacrifices of objects (cloth, fur, feather) as well as coins which afterwards could be taken back for the purchase of new sacrificial gifts.123 Just as with the house cult, so the hut cult also has come under the influence of the church. The worship of saints with the images of the saints entered the old sacrificial huts. In the sacred rear corner where formerly the sacrificial box had been on the cult stand, later images of the saints found their place. However, at times these are referred to with the name of the old hut spirit mudor.124 Certain important basic features in the old folk religion of the Permian peoples have been briefly presented here. These religious conceptions and customs are connected with different spheres of the environment and life. They form the background for the diverse beliefs in souls and in the dead (death ritual, image of the next life, ancestor cult) of these peoples which I have described in detail in other works.'25 The excerpts 121 Hamalainen, "Der vorsud-mudor-Kult"; Harva, Finno-ugric, Siberian, pp. 129 if. 122 Georgi, Beschreibung aller Nationen des Russischen Reiches, pp. 60 ff. 123 Harva, Finno-ugric, Siberian, pp. 119 f. 124 Buch, Die Wotjdken, pp. 172 f. 125 Paulson, "Seelenvorstellungen und Totenglaube der permischen und wolga- finnischen Volker," Numen - International Review for the History of Religions, Vol. XI (1964), 212-242; Paulson, "Jenseitsglaube der finnischen Volker, I: In der wolga- 178 IVAR PAULSON</page><page sequence="32">OUTLINE OF PERMIAN FOLK RELIGION reproduced above cover the most important (but not all) aspects in the religious life of these peoples.
