Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, GR 9-1917. Just as we cherish Grandmother's turkey platter, drink coffee from mugs commemorating sports events, and bring out the fine china for festive dinners, so did the ancient Greeks use the painted pottery which we now install as artifacts in museum cases. The shapes of these red clay vessels were tailored for specific uses. Their decora tions sometimes reflect those functions, illustrate historical or mytho logical scenes, or recall important family celebrations. The figures on the earlier pottery, beginning ca. seventh century BC, were black (painted with slip which turned black when fired), giving rise to the term black-figure. The pottery of later centuries bore figures in the color of the red clay of the vessel itself (red-figure), with background and outlines in the black slip. A glimpse into the china cabinet of ancient Greece reveals a pa rade of figures whose influence has lasted for millennia. Who would imagine that the melody of "The Star Spangled Banner" was inspired by a poet portrayed on Greek vases? Or that a dancing nude male painted on a Greek vase would inspire an Italian Renaissance artist to repeat the image on the wall of a villa? Two Greek red-figure column kraters (vessels in which wine and water were mixed) in The Cleveland Museum of Art supply the answers to these questions.' THE PIG PAINTER AND THE MANNERIST WORKSHOP Both Cleveland vessels (see Covers and Figures 6-7) are the work of the Pig Painter, a lesser-known master of the fifth century BC. He was one of the earliest members of the Mannerist workshop, orga nized by the respected artist Myson in the Potters' Quarter of Athens around 480 BC and lasting until the end of the century.2 The Pig Painter received his less than flattering name from a pelike (a storage jar), now in Cambridge, on which he painted two pigs in a scene representing the Greek hero Odysseus and his faithful swineherd, Eumaios (Figure 1).3 On this, his name vase, the Pig Painter's in volvement with the prosaic aspect of the curly-tailed pigs exempli fies the Mannerists' interest in genre detail. The expressions on the pigs' faces are compellingly human as they investigate each other's noses. The Pig Painter was less certain, however, of how to draw Eumaios' hands, indicative of this pelike's early position among the examples of his works discussed here.4 83</page><page sequence="2">84 Figure 2. Hydria. Earthenware with slip decoration, H. 32 cm. The Leningrad Painter, Greek, Attic, fifth century BC. Milan, Torno Collection, C.278. Mannerist vessels are especially interesting because the painters periodically selected unusual subjects, such as obscure events from mythology, theater performances, or detailed genre scenes. On a hydria (a water jar) now in Milan (Figure 2), the Leningrad Painter provided a view of the Mannerists, the companions of the Pig Painter, at work.5 The Leningrad Painter praised his own workshop by commemorating a special imagined event, the goddess Athena appearing in the workshop to award laurel crowns to the three male artists (while ignoring the female painter). We can recognize the work of Mannerist vase painters by a char acteristic figure style: thinned proportions and exaggerated, but not awkward, gestures.6 The identifying characteristics of the Pig Painter's work include clavicles ending in little hooks, a chest area with the curve of one side of the clavicle forming the median line and then recurving to define the pectorals, and the junction of the pectorals often forming a small triangle at the base (see Figure 3). He drew stylized ears in the shape of a question mark, small eyes (with solidly painted pupils) placed near the nose, and a line below</page><page sequence="3">the eye that curves slightly downward at the outer edge (see Figure 8). Many of his figures have thin mustaches. They move in a rhythmic dance, sometimes looking backward or down or over their shoul ders. The figures on Cleveland's vases share these idiosyncrasies. Favorite vase shapes and certain conservative choices of acces sory ornament also distinguish Mannerist products.7 These painters selected vases that were mid-range in size, like the hydria and pelike shapes (Figures 2 and 1), but the larger column krater was also a particular favorite. In fact, column kraters (Cover) with a flat rim and handle-plates, and an angular foot profile with an upper degree at least equal in height to the lower degree, are seen so consistently, especially around 470-460 BC, that a single potter or specific group of potters probably produced them.8 Over half of the Pig Painter's identified works are column kraters.9 The similarity of the subsidiary decoration on Mannerist pots is not accidental and almost serves as a trademark; its consistency suggests that one painter worked on just the subsidiary decoration.10 The black-figure ivy pattern, for instance, frequently appears as a border with a chain of lotus buds on the neck, black tongues near the joining of body to neck, and a large frieze of black rays at the base of their vessels. Much of this ornament came from the earlier black-figure era. Perhaps because the workshop catered to more conservative tastes, its products were popular and successful. The vessels shown here represent their typical stock. The Pig Painter thus operated in a milieu in which many different artists painted figures in a similar style on similar vessel types, which strengthens the possibility that many Mannerist products resembled his. Even the leading authority on Greek vase-painting, J. D. Beazley, found it difficult to separate the work of the Pig Painter from that of other Mannerists, especially Myson, and considered the possibility that the Pig Painter was the late Myson. Originally calling the Pig Painter the See-Saw Painter, because of the image on a fragment in Boston, Beazley later gave that piece to the Leningrad Painter and renamed our painter the Pig Painter.11 One of Cleveland's column kraters is a handsome example of the Pig Painter's talent; for convenience I call it the Party vase (Covers). Its main composition is an elegant study of a man and a youth.12 The man, a guest at a drinking party, has overindulged in wine. Not able to drain all the wine from the kylix (a stemmed wine cup) in his left hand, he vomits onto the floor, while a nude serving boy, holding the man's lyre, backs away to a safe distance.13 85</page><page sequence="4">86 That a vase painter would poke fun at those who could not hold their drink, and would do so specifically on a column krater, under lines both the major role of the symposium drinking party in Greek social life and the part this vase shape played in it. The symposium was the planned time after a banquet in which the guests, all male, followed a course of entertainment structured by the host. They re clined on couches placed around the periphery of the room with the column krater in the central space. The guests drank, played music, recited poetry, and participated in learned and witty conversation on topics of the host's choosing.14 Both the conversation and the wine were free-flowing. The images on the krater often illustrated the on-going party or, as here, the results of the merrymaking.15 By the time the Pig Painter decorated this vase, the symposium had evolved from a Dionysiac ritual to a less structured event. Although the wives of the host and guests were not allowed to attend, profes sional female entertainers were. Pleasure was the focus. The krater played a major role at the drinking party, functioning as a large, handsome punch bowl in which water and wine were mixed in proportions dictated by the symposium host,16 who also prescribed the quantity to be consumed.17 The Cleveland column krater is a standard variation of the krater shape; its name comes from the handles that form a double column rising from the shoulder to join the extended lip. Servants used a kyathos, or dipper, to ladle the properly mixed wine from the krater into the kylix. This special shape of cup held by the Pig Painter's inelegant reveler was intended only for use by a man. (His wife, at home, would have used a differ ent, more ordinary drinking cup with two handles and no stem, a skyphos.) Clearly aware that this column krater would be used at a drinking party, the Pig Painter tailored his message to his audience. Smaller details also reinforce the idea of feasting and revelry. The young boy attending the man is a cupbearer or wine server. He holds two objects important at parties: a basket with animal-paw feet and a lyre, a musical instrument popular at drinking parties.18 On the reverse of the Party vase the festivities are in full swing. A man, expressing the gala spirit, is shown with his himation falling off his left shoulder and his left shoe missing (Back Cover). The ev eryday household skyphos in his left hand tilts precariously: in the next moment he will raise his chin to catch the cascading wine. The lighthearted abandon of these after-dinner dances challenged the vase painters to produce endless variations of gesture and</page><page sequence="5">movement. Here, the Pig Painter seems to understand better how folds of cloth would drape on a human body, and his figures are rendered in motion, a more challenging task. Thus, this vase was probably created slightly later in his career than his name vase, the Cambridge pelike (Figure 1).19 In making the Party krater, the Pig Painter first sketched out his figures using a blunt instrument to make incisions in the unfired clay (Figure 3).20 Thus the figure of the single reveler, and the two figures on the obverse, especially on their right sides and arms, bear the strong impressions of his rapid first thoughts. He even sketched the outline of both sides of the single reveler's upraised left arm, although it was covered by the himation (Back Cover).21 Although traces of preliminary sketches are often present on vessels, they are Figure 3.

The nature of his mate rials caused the Pig Painter to give the man's red staff a black handle on the obverse, because a red one would not have been visible against the man's red body. "Ghost" images, vestiges of borders framing the feet of two danc ing figures and the feet of a man wearing a himation, appear inside the vase's neck (Figure 4). They transferred from another vase, placed inside the Cleveland vase for firing. The glaze on the second vase absorbed enough heat during the firing to transfer as a "ghost" to the Party vase which, because of the other's proximity, did not become hot enough to render this part of its glaze black.22 The graf fito Simonos scratched through the fired glaze on the reverse of the Party krater probably identifies a later owner or commemorates a gift and is unrelated to the Pig Painter and the original production of this pot (Figure 5).23 Cleveland's other red-figure column krater by the Pig Painter, nicknamed here the Poet vase, continues the theme of revelry (Fig ures 6-7). Although close in shape to the Party krater, this vessel has more profuse subsidiary ornamentation, almost the standard for Mannerist column kraters. An intriguing Mannerist trait reveals itself: the arms of the lyre and the big toe of the left man on the obverse side intrude into this decoration (Figure 8).24 The Poet krater was probably made later in the Pig Painter's career than the Party vase. Its compositions involve figures that turn in space, which requires skill in foreshortening.</page><page sequence="7">Figures 6-7. Obverse and reverse of Column Krater.

The obverse side shows merrymakers in action (Figures 6, 8), as did the Party vase, though the subject is more richly treated here. Three bearded men are dancing, each wearing a long chiton, a himation, and on his head a sakkos. Two, with curly beards, wear earrings as well. The left man twirls a parasol and holds a pair of sound-making krotala.25 The central figure plays the barbitos, the same type of lyre that appears on the Party vase, as he walks and sings.26 His song is signified by the string of letters coming from his mouth. The right man, with straight, fringed beard, holds a large symposium kylix, familiar from the Party vase. The number of unusual accessories, rendered in such detail, indicates that this is more than an ordinary party scene.</page><page sequence="9">Dressed in what could be considered feminine apparel, these bearded revelers on the Poet vase are obviously engaged in a special type of revelry. But is it what we, in the late twentieth century AD, immediately think? Clearly this is not a "feast of parasols" or a religious procession, as some scholars have considered.27 By 1942 Martin Nilsson realized that the kylix and the krotala would be out of place in a sacred procession and concluded that the Poet krater showed men in women's attire participating in the usual post banquet frolic.28 Andreas Rumpf concurred, stressing that their full beards made it plain that they were wearing borrowed fancy-dress.29 Beazley also believed that these were men dressed up as women, not women disguised as men, given the lack of breasts and the natural-looking beards.30 He found the source for this frivolity in the time spent in Athens by the Ionian lyric poet Anakreon, a well known playboy. A similar scene by the Kleophrades Painter is in scribed Anakreon on the lyre, which identifies it with Anakreon and his convivial companions.31 Beazley thought that these scenes illus trated a special komos, with Anakreon himself playing the lyre.32 Born about 572 BC in lonia in East Greece, Anakreon belonged to the carefree world of wine, women, and song or-to be more exact-wine, women, boys, and song.33 His sophistication and style were extraordinary, making him the favorite guest of powerful aristo crats. Polykrates summoned Anakreon to Samos, where he taught music to the tyrant's son. Polykrates' ruin has been attributed to his softening under the influence of this extravagant and sensual poet. At the height of his fame Anakreon was called to Athens in 522 BC by Hipparchos. After the poet's death there in the 480s, the Athe nians placed a statue of him on the Acropolis.34 In his own lifetime Anakreon was painted on vases, one of only two lyric poets to be so honored. His fame was long-lasting and widespread-in fact, the tune of "The Star-Spangled Banner" is actually the melody for a song honoring this Greek poet.35 91</page><page sequence="10">92 Preferring peace and pleasure, Anakreon composed poetry that combined the lyrical and the witty, the passionate and the fanciful. Meant to be sung after dinner, examples of his verse include: I like not him, who, when he quaffs wine over a full bowl, talks of strifes and tearful war, but him who mixes the glorious gifts of the Muses and Aphrodite and recalls the good times which he loves.36 and Again golden-haired Eros hits me with his purple ball and challenges me to sport with a girl of many-colored sandals. But no, she's from well-built Lesbos, my white hair she scorns, and at another girl she stares with mouth agape.37 Anakreon set the style for fashionable Athenian revels. He favored the barbitos lyre, mentioning it in his poetry.38 Depicted on both the Poet vase and the Party vase, it appears on Greek pottery after ca. 520 BC. The art historian John Boardman affirmed that Anakreon himself introduced the barbitos, an East Greek invention, to Athens.39 According to another art historian, H. A. Shapiro, the costume worn by Anakreonic revelers was not thought effeminate in Athens but was merely an exotic reflection of Anakreon's East Greek con nections. Its foreignness appealed visually to vase painters, and it highlighted the interests of the eastward-looking Athenian aristoc racy, who appreciated Anakreon's polished wit, refinement, and cultivated Ionian ways.40 Boardman concurred with Shapiro that these "booners," or boon companions of Anakreon, were fashion ably dressed in orientalizing clothing made popular by the Ionian Anakreon.41 He traced the evolution of the sakkos seen on the Poet vase from the practice of men wearing turbans, a principally male eastern headdress. In the sixth century BC, however, women as well as men began to wear the turban, and by the end of that century, men wore the headgear only for revels. Boardman placed no conno tation of femininity on this practice.</page><page sequence="11">At the time the Cleveland vase was painted, women, senior citi zens, and Dionysos properly wore the chiton, while in eastern Greece (also the source for the turban) men, including male dancers, favored the chiton.42 The peplos was more strictly worn only by women, so if these dressed-up men had intended to impersonate women, they would have donned that garment instead. The revelers wear earrings on two of the Anakreonic vases, the Poet vase and a cup in Basel by the Dokimasia Painter.43 Boardman traced this additional feminine element in dress to Lydia in eastern Greece and suggested that earrings were an acceptable component of revelry apparel, if perhaps a bit foppish. Boardman also debunked the feminine implication of the parasol. In the east it indicated status and was held over the king to symbolize the manner in which he casts the shadow of his protection over his people. The parasol ap peared first to the Greeks as the oriental insignia of a male dignitary. Thus, Boardman found no reason to believe that these men, whose beards solidified their sexual identity, meant to impersonate women. The change from the typical nearly nude reveler at a symposium to one dressed in the fashion depicted on this Pig Painter vase can be traced to Anakreon's influence. What looks like feminine imperson ation to our modern eyes is merely the infiltration of eastern habits into Athenian life. Although the painting on the reverse of the krater (Figure 7) lacks a close association with a Greek poet or American history, it com pensates by presenting a clue to the antique sources of an Italian Renaissance artist. The merrymaking of three revelers on the reverse of the vase is less explicit than on the obverse. Attributes describing the environment of the figures are absent. In the scene, the nude youth on the left capers playfully; the right nude turns back toward him and prepares to repeat the frolicsome movement. The center youth, enveloped in a himation, is not accepting their invitation to join the fun. 93</page><page sequence="12">94 ?s?P Figures 9-10. Reverse and obverse of Column Krater.

Huntington Museum Fund and The James R. Dougherty, Jr., Foundation, 1980, 1980.39. The revelers on the Poet vase are only a small contingent of a veritable legion of dancers and athletes by the Pig Painter that are so similar in appearance as to be blood relations. To select only two examples, vessels in Austin and Brussels bear figures that belong in the family portrait gallery with the Poet dancers. On a column krater by the Pig Painter in the Huntington Gallery at the University of Texas at Austin, the athletes are recognizably the work of the Pig Painter (Figure 9).44 The empty discus-bag hanging on the wall places the scene in the palestra. Two figures hold a javelin and halteres (hand weights used in gymnastics), while the central figure grasps a trainer's forked wand. They bear a family resemblance to the Poet revelers, with the same proportions and characteristic style. Although the Pig Painter is working with difficult ways of represent ing the figure on the Austin krater, the bodies do not yet have the sophisticated foreshortening of the Poet vase revelers. He renders the two left figures from the back, while the upper torso of the right figure is in three-quarter view. This pose is more ambitious than the combination of frontal and profile views on the single figure on the reverse side of the Party vase. The Austin vessel was therefore probably painted after the Party vase, but before the Poet vase.45 The intricate mythological scene of Dionysos with Ariadne and her four-horse chariot on the obverse of the Austin krater (Figure 1 0) is richer in detail and complexity than the moment with Odysseus and Eumaios on the Cambridge pelike (Figure 1) or the obverse Party</page><page sequence="13"> Figures 11-12. Reverse and obverse of Column Krater. Earthenware with slip decoration and added red, H. 40.5 cm. The Pig Painter. Brussels, Musees Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire, R305. vase incident (Front Cover).46 Yet, as his skill increased, the Pig Painter did not abandon his "family portraits": compare the heads of Dionysos, the trainer on Austin's reverse, and the central figure on the reverse of the Poet vase (cf., Figures 1 0, 9, and 7). Familiar forms also populate the reverse of a column krater in Brussels by the Pig Painter (Figure 11 ).47 From the waist up, the left figure is almost identical with the left Poet reveler (Figure 7). As on the Austin vase, the Pig Painter included details to specify the setting, and the athletes hold halteres, while the central figure, the trainer, grasps the forked wand, the training baton. The Brussels krater is chronologically the latest of the Pig Painter vessels illus trated here. Differences from earlier vessels are especially apparent in the ambitious and successful composition on its obverse side, on which Theseus is depicted killing the minotaur in the presence of King Minos (Figure 1 2). The narrow folds of Theseus' drapery repre sent a later development, the vigorous action intrudes more deeply into the subsidiary decoration than on the earlier vases, and the krater shape is less bulbous and more graceful. In the scene, Theseus grasps his sword firmly and convincingly. The wounded minotaur, with blood streaming from his armpit, raises his arms as he asks for mercy. His face retains the anthropomorphic quality of the pigs of the Cambridge pelike. Despite the memorable spots, the minotaur's body is unmistakably human, with sophisticated biceps and deltoids. 95</page><page sequence="14">96 Figure 13. Reverse of Column Krater. Earthenware with slip decoration and added red, H. 40 cm, 470-465 BC. The Leningrad Painter. The Detroit Institute of Arts, City of Detroit Purchase, 24.120. The artist has not solved the problem of the tail, but has attached it at the side of the minotaur's hip. The minotaur's challenging position required skill in the drawing of foreshortened limbs twisted at angles and reaffirms Pig Painter's strong interest in the convincing portrayal of figures in active, complex poses. The Poet vase revelers and their kin are also closely related to the Leningrad Painter's family of images. A column krater in the Detroit Institute of Arts, attributed to the Leningrad Painter but originally assigned by Beazley to the Pig Painter, portrays on its reverse a draped trainer standing between two nude athletes (Figure 1 3).48 The Leningrad Painter's right athlete is almost identical with the right reveler from the Poet vase (Figure 7), and only the proportions differentiate the Leningrad Painter's left athlete (Figure 1 3) from the Pig Painter's left athlete on the Brussels krater (Figure 11). This un derscores the closeness of imagery between painters in the Manner ist workshop. In fact, the figures on the four vessels in Cleveland, Austin, Brussels, and Detroit (Back Cover, Figures 9, 11, and 1 3) appear to have the same ancestry, which suggests that a survey of additional Pig Painter, Leningrad Painter, and Mannerist vessels would reveal others with this family resemblance.</page><page sequence="15">POLLAIUOLO AND THE PIG PAINTER The Florentine artist Antonio Pollaiuolo (1431/2-1498) had an in tense respect for and knowledge of the sculpture of classical antiq uity, which resounds throughout much of his work. Did Pollaiuolo also study Greek vases and reflect the vase painters' analysis of the movement of human form in his paintings? Comparison of the Pig Painter's revelers on the Poet vase with a fresco painted by Pollaiu olo in the Villa La Gallina at Pian dei Giullari near Florence, as well as other evidence, suggests that he did (cf., Figures 7 and 1 5-1 7).49 Pollaiuolo's fresco adorns a medium-sized, vaulted room in the villa.50 It presents a frieze of five nude dancers, nearly two-thirds life size (Figures 15 and 1 7). The figures command the viewer's attention with their vigorous and skillfully described movement. The figure third from the right, with his left leg raised suggestively in the aban don of dance, parallels the left figure from the reverse of Cleveland's Poet krater so nearly as to raise the conjecture that Pollaiuolo stud ied the striking and erotic action captured by the ancient Greek artist and repeated it in his fresco. Although it is a recognized fact that Renaissance artists studied antique sculpture, whether Greek ceramics were of interest to Italian Renaissance artists is a controversial topic.51 Some scholars have compared vase-paintings with Renaissance works of art and have concluded that a visual relationship does exist. According to art historian Cornelius Vermeule, subsidiary detail from Greek vases (especially kraters of ca. 500 to 465 BC) became a part of frame decoration in the Florentine quattrocento.52 This is important evi dence that Renaissance artists carefully studied Greek vases. Exca vation of Etruscan tombs brought to light both Greek and Etruscan vessels, and fifteenth-century artists adapted motifs found on them for use in their own work.53 Some scholars, however, still categori cally deny any connection between antique vases and Renaissance art.54 Nevertheless, Greek vases were available in Pollaiuolo's Flo rence; the difficulty lies in determining which ones were known.55 97</page><page sequence="16">98 Records of interchanges with Lorenzo de'Medici, one of Pollaiuolo's major patrons, document this wealthy and powerful Florentine's interest in antique ceramics.56 Such antiquities were unfortunately not included in the inventory of his holdings, though; the primary evidence for their presence comes from anecdotes and letters. In 1475 Giorgio Vasari, the grandfather of the famous biographer, presented Lorenzo with gifts of Aretine pottery.57 In 1491 Zaccaria Barbero of Venice offered Lorenzo three vases, one of which was described as being large in size and from Greece. Angelo Poliziano wrote Lorenzo about the offer, observing that he believed Lorenzo did not have a vase of this kind that was so beautiful.58 This implies not only a collection, but also Poliziano's knowledge of it. Additionally, two experts on the Medici collections, Laurie Fusco (also a Pollaiuolo specialist) and Gino Corti (the foremost archivist working in Italy today), have discovered a new document giving more insight into Lorenzo's collecting habits, a 1489 letter from Nofri Tornabuoni to Lorenzo listing items found in an excavation at San Lorenzo in Panisperna in Rome.59 Tornabuoni, who was negoti ating the acquisition of objects for Lorenzo, mentioned both works in marble and many pieces of vases. Tornabuoni would not have mentioned the potsherds had he not been aware of Lorenzo's inter est in ancient vessels. These sources suggest the presence of Greek vases in the Medici collection. Although Greek vessels probably belonged to other collections, Pollaiuolo surely had access to those owned by the Medici. The Villa La Gallina fresco is not the only composition by Pollaiuolo whose appearance suggests Greek vase-painting as a source.60 One of Pollaiuolo's key works and his only engraving, The Battle of the Nudes-of which The Cleveland Museum of Art owns a unique impression-provides prime evidence in the debate regarding his classical sources (Figure 14).61 Strong similarities exist between figural motifs in this composition and those in antique sculpture.62 Convincing comparisons between the engraving and antique vase-painting have also been pointed out by perceptive scholars. Fern Shapley, the expert on Italian painting who in 1920 set the stage for the discussion of Pollaiuolo's study of Greek vases, observed in relation to a drawing for the Battle that both his reliance on outline and his silhouetting of the light figures against a dark background proclaim a familiarity with Greek red-figure vase</page><page sequence="17">I r Figure 14.

CMA 67.127 painting.63 The Italian Renaissance specialist Andre Chastel similarly associated Pollaiuolo's concern for line, contour, and anatomy in the Battle of the Nudes with descriptions of vases found in Etruscan tombs.64 Most recently, a specific relationship has been proposed between Pollaiuolo's Battle and a vase by the Niobid Painter, now in the Louvre.65 Analogies between the figures in the Battle engraving and those in the Villa La Gallina fresco have led scholars to propose comparable types of sources for the two works.66 That a relationship between Greek vase-painting and the engraving has been consid ered and that a similarity in figure-type between the engraving and the fresco has been noted lend credence to the idea that a vase painting's composition inspired the fresco of dancers. 99</page><page sequence="18">100 Figure 1 5. Frieze of Dancers. Fresco, , ca. 1460-1475. Antonio Pollaiuolo. Pian dei Giullari (near Florence), Villa Like the figures in the Battle engraving, Pollaiuolo's Villa La Gallina fresco of dancing nudes evokes classical inspiration, without explicitly disclosing its derivation from a specific work of art from antiquity (Figure 15). According to experts on Italian art, both classi cal sculpture and vase-painting could serve as possible sources for the fresco figures. Eve Borsook, who has published extensively on fresco cycles in Italy, observed the relationship of the dancing fig ures to the sequence of figure types on a Dionysiac sarcophagus. The distinguished scholar Fritz SaxI proposed that the frescoes refer to a Hellenistic bronze. To Chastel, Pollaiuolo's figures with their turbulent expressions of gaiety evoked the imagery found in Etruscan tomb paintings.67 The most persuasive parallels to Pollaiuolo's nude dancers, how ever, are those found in Greek vase-painting. Shapley, the first to propose that the vigorous, exhilarating movement of the figures in the fresco originated in Greek vase-paintings, presented several ex amples as evidence of the affinity between the two.68 The renowned art historian Erwin Panofsky felt in 1972 that these Bacchic dancers showed Pollaiuolo's familiarity with Greek vases, while Kenneth Clark in 1959 had related them to Etruscan pottery.69 A satyr on a volute krater by the Painter of Bologna 279 has been cited as a pre cedent for Pollaiuolo's figure on the far right in the frieze of danc ers.70 Although these carefully selected possible prototypes bear</page><page sequence="19">Left: Figure 1 6. Detail of the Poet vase (CMA 26.549). Right: Figure 17. Detail of Figure 15, Frieze of Dancers. I~~~~~~~~~~~hl affinities to the Pollaiuolo nudes, the Pig Painter's dancers on Cleveland's Poet vase seem to be closer kin (Figure 7) and appar ently foreshadow Pollaiuolo's interest in jerky, unusual movement. While it is impossible to say that Pollaiuolo actually knew the Poet vase, the convincing parallel between the revelers on the Poet vase and Pollaiuolo's fresco in the Villa La Gallina (Figures 7 and 1 5) can be noted. Despite the differences in scale of the works, both portray a frieze of dancers and explore the theme of male nudes in action. Compare the Pig Painter's left reveler with Pollaiuolo's dancer, third from right (Figures 1 6 and 1 7): the two painters share a sharp interest in the foreshortening of the identical upraised leg. In Pollaiuolo's search for a convincing way to render perspective and movement, this provocative pose arrested his attention. The dancer's head turns to his left; his chest is frontal, with the legs and lower torso rotated at an angle to the viewer. The figure balances firmly with the right foot on the axis extending from the head, as the left knee rises to match the upward direction of the left arm. This pecu liarity of movement shows the artist's sophisticated exploration of a complex figure turning in space. Both the pose of the figure and the foreshortened viewpoint are unorthodox. Vase painters generally rendered this type of movement from a strictly frontal position.7' Versions of the motion appear particularly in Dionysiac revels but seldom with the combination of body tor sion, foreshortening in the raised leg, and the alternation of raising and lowering arms.72 That Pollaiuolo would have developed such a 101</page><page sequence="20">102 pose independently, so similar in all its components, pushes coinci dence very far indeed. Although the fresco figure's right arm has vanished, the direction of its shoulder indicates that at least the up per arm would have been extended downward in the manner of the Pig Painter's figure. The action of the other limbs mirrors that of the figure on the vase, while differences appear in Pollaiuolo's exaggera tion of the bend in his figure's left arm and his rendering of the head in three-quarter view.73 Pollaiuolo's fresco dancer shows a strong visual correspondence with the antique reveler, whether from the Poet vase or a similar one. The figures share formal parallels in the use of silhouette, contour, and expressive line. Pollaiuolo's silhouetting of his dancers against a darker background immediately signals the importance of red-figure vase-painting to the fresco.74 Pollaiuolo incised the outline of the fresco figures into the plaster in a manner similar to the preliminary sketch technique especially evident on Cleveland's Party vase.75 The delicate use of faint traces of color is also familiar from vase-paint ing. The contours of the fresco figures express the general action, rather than internal delineated movement, of the muscles; the Pig Painter's figures also depend on contour to convey their motion. The refined lines of the widespread fingers of Pollaiuolo's figures recall the open fingers of the Pig Painter revelers. Both groupings of figures depend on the expressiveness of line rather than on descriptive de tail. These shared formal devices reinforce the impression of the im portance to Pollaiuolo of a composition on a Greek vase. In addition to the formal parallels and the close conjunction of position between the two figures with upraised legs, the overall ar rangements of both sets of three revelers have affinities. Pollaiuolo grouped his three figures on the right side of the fresco in the same pattern as the Pig Painter's revelers (cf., Figures 7 and 1 7). In both cases the two outer participants are strongly involved in the dance while the more static central figure acts as a pivot around which the others balance. In both cases the bodies of the two outer figures move at an angle away from the central one, while their heads turn inward. And, despite the differences in drapery, the gesture of the Pig Painter's non-participatory figure evokes that of Pollaiuolo's central female figure. As did the Pig Painter, Pollaiuolo places the figure with upraised leg at the left of the group. Had he composed this complex dancer without reference to a vase composition, it would have been more logical for this figure to form the focal point of the group.</page><page sequence="21">The two paintings share a similarity of spirit, as well as the close connection between the motifs. The Dionysiac revel of the fresco is the compositional equivalent of the dancers on the vase: both are scenes of action that tell no story.76 Despite the evidence of striking visual correspondence between the Pig Painter's reveler and Pollaiuolo's dancer, the use of this particular Greek vase as a source for Pollaiuolo's fresco cannot be established with certainty. Documentation of the presence of the Poet vase in Italy during Pollaiuolo's lifetime is difficult.77 It is pos sible, however, that other vases existed with figures resembling the revelers on the Poet vase and that Pollaiuolo saw one of them. Close similarities exist in both composition and figure style between vases produced in the Mannerist workshop: witness the throng of revelers and athletes, all seemingly of the same ancestry, which populate the Mannerist vessels in Cleveland, Austin, Brussels, and Detroit (Figures 7, 9, 1 1, and 1 3). The comparison could be extended to include many more Mannerist works that together would illustrate a virtual family genealogy. Thus, even lacking a direct link between the Pig Painter's Poet krater and the work of Antonio Pollaiuolo, the possibility is strong that Pollaiuolo examined similar Greek red figure vases of the Mannerist school. The strength of the visual relationship between the Pig Painter's figures of revelers on the Cleveland Poet krater and Pollaiuolo's fresco of dancing nudes in the Villa La Gallina enriches the signifi cance of the Poet vase for viewers today. The Pig Painter has prepared for us a party feast-serving insight into Greek culture and glimpses into the process of vase-painting, and as a seductive dessert, a key to understanding a Renaissance artist's fascination with antiquity.

Beazley (The Pan Painter [Mainz: Verlag Philipp von Zabern, 1974], pp. 8-9) explains that he so named the workshop because its mix of old forms with new reminded him of the Antwerp Mannerists of the early six teenth century. One of the members of the workshop, the Pan Painter, quickly surpassed the master Myson, while the Pig Painter and others, such as the Leningrad Painter and the Agrigento Painter, missed the mark. Beazley (ARV2, p. 562) evaluated the workshop as third-rate. Gisela M. A. Richter (Red Figured Athenian Vases in the Metro politan Museum of Art, 2 vols. [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1936], 1: 97) praised the Pig Painter's rhythmi cal compositions and considered him to be one of the best of the Mannerists. See also Boardman, Archaic, pp. 1 79 196, for Mannerist quality. 3. Cambridge, the Fitzwilliam Museum, GR 9-1917, ARV2 564.27. Boardman ("Booners," p. 35 n. 1) reports that Beazley, in his notes, referred familiarly to the painter as "Pigger" but published the name in more dignified form. 4. The Pig Painter's later vases show less stylized poses, more understanding of drapery, and greater exploration of movement. For the Cambridge pelike, see Winifred Lamb, Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, fasc. 1 (Great Britain 6) (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1930), pp. 34-35.</page><page sequence="23">5. Torno Collection, Milan, ARV2 571.73. The iconography is controver sial. Richard Green (in "The Caputi Hydria," Journal of Hellenic Studies 81 [1961]: 73-75) proposes that the paint ing depicts the decorators of metal ves sels and discusses Beazley's objections to this theory. Noble (Techniques, pp. 116-1 18, 205-206 n. 11 ) holds that it shows vase painters at work. 6. Being able to distinguish the hand of a specific vase painter from his associ ates' adds to the pleasure of studying Greek vases. For additional idiosyncra sies of the Pig Painter, see Richter, Met ropolitan, 1: 97, and Diana M.

J. D. Beazley attributed about fifty one vases, including the Cleveland column kraters, to the Pig Painter; see Beazley, ARV2, pp. 562-566. The Pig Painter's pots include thirty column kraters, nine pelikes, two type B amphorae, four neck amphorae, and five hydriae. 10. For this division of labor, refer to Moon, Midwestern, p. 167. 11. J. D. Beazley, Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums (Cam bridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1918), pp. 118-120. Moon (Midwestern, p. 167) comments on the Pig Painter's identity. 12. The inscription kalos, or beautiful, is painted above the man's head. Kalos, unaccompanied by the proper name of a person or god, addresses praise to one of several possible people: the person painted on the vase, a popular youth noted for his beauty, the intended re cipient of the vase, or someone favored by the painter. David M. Robinson and Edward J. Fluck (A Study of the Greek Love-Names [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1937], pp. 2-7) explain the kalos inscriptions. According to Lissarrague (Aesthetics of the Greek Banquet, p. 33) the inscription expresses the aesthetic pleasure derived from looking at a hu man body. 13. Howard ("Wine Bowl," p. 67) re marks that the Greek motto "Nothing too much" found limited application regarding the use of wine at parties. These scenes were neither uncommon nor considered distasteful. Similar mo tifs decorate kylikes, such as ARV2 373.32 by the Brygos Painter. 14. Lissarrague (Aesthetics of the Greek Banquet, pp. 7-9) describes the sympo sium and emphasizes wine's place in it. 15. Boardman (Archaic, p. 218) stresses the importance of this drinking party iconography in the Archaic red-figure period. Lissarrague (Greek Banquet, pp. 21-43) discusses the iconography of wine on the symposium vessels and the significance of the central placement of the krater at the symposium. 1 6. The name of the vase shape comes from the Greek verb for "to mix"; see Gisela M. A. Richter and Marjorie J. Milne, Shapes and Names of Athenian Vases (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1935), pp. 6-7. The column krater probably originated in Corinth in the late seventh century BC. Moon (Mid western, p. 1 67) traces the shape from its origins to the Mannerist workshop. 1 7. According to Lissarrague, Aesthetics of the Greek Banquet, p. 8. 105</page><page sequence="24">106 18. D. A. Amyx writes on the types of baskets associated with food and ban queting in "The Attic Stelai," pt. 3, Hesperia, 27 (1958): 268-271. Our basket approximates but does not dupli cate his type-drawings of footed baskets in pl. 51 b. See also Amyx's discussion of ceramic water pots with metal handles, ibid., pp. 186-190. Boulter (CVA Cleveland, p. 18) calls it a situla, a deep, somewhat cylindrical container, but suggests that the bindings are more typical of a basket. Amyx ("A New Pelike by the Geras Painter," American Journal of Archaeology 49, no. 4 [1945]: 514) states that situlas are rarely painted on Attic vases and (p. 514 n.24) allows that those on Italian vases often resemble baskets. 19. Boulter (CVA Cleveland, p. 18) dates CMA 24.197 (the Party vase) to ca. 470-460 BC; Lamb (CVA Cambridge, p. 35) places the Cambridge pelike at ca. 475-465 BC. 20. Exactly what tool was used is not known. P. E. Corbett (in "Preliminary Sketch in Greek Vase-Painting," Journal of Hellenic Studies 85 [1965]: 16-28) explores this aspect of vase-painting. 21. He drew the fingers in the same position as those of the man holding a kylix on the obverse side. According to Boulter (CVA Cleveland, p. 18), he probably first intended to paint a kylix rather than a skyphos. 22. On types and causes of ghost im ages, including this one, consult Noble, Techniques, pp. 162-164. 23. The name Simonos occurs often; for it, see J. D. Beazley, The Develop ment of Attic Black-Figure (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986), pp. 72-73. Dorothy Burr Thompson ("The House of Simon the Shoemaker," Archaeology 13, no. 4 [December 19601: 234-240) discusses a Simon's presence in Athens ca. 450-410 BC; his house in the Agora has been excavated. The form of the letters in the graffito, particularly the triple-barred sigma, was used in the 5th century. L. H. Jeffery analyzes letter forms in Local Scripts of Archaic Greece: A Study of the Origin of the Greek Alphabet and Its Develop ment from the Eighth to the Fifth Centu ries BC (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1 961 ); refer to the "Table of Letters" at end. For a shortened chart of Athenian letters, consult John Boardman, Athe nian Black Figure Vases (London: Thames and Hudson, 1988), p. 202. 24. For the interrupted frame, see Jeffrey Hurwit, "Image and Frame in Greek Art," American Journal of Archaeology 81, no. 1 (Winter 1977): 9-10. 25. For the krotala, which are similar to castanets, and the possibility that their presence indicates a mythical follower of Dionysos, see Maas, Stringed Instru ments, p. 69. 26. The man's right hand finishes a stroke with the plektron, which is at tached to the barbitos with a red cord. The distinctive shape of the lyre, with long inward-curving arms and tortoise shell sounding box, identifies it as the barbitos, which came into Athens near the end of the sixth century from eastern Greece. For the origins of the barbitos, see Maas, Stringed Instruments, pp. 39 40; for its iconography, pp. 11 3-1 28. 27. For a brief review of these theories, consult Nilsson, "Krater," p. 225. 28. Nilsson ("Krater," p. 225) quotes from Philostratos: "The revel (after a banquet) allows a woman to appear as a man and a man to put on a woman's dress and walk as a woman." Jones ("Four Vases," p. 8) suggests that any connection with Dionysiac ritual, rather than informal merrymaking in his honor, came from the painter's or the revelers' parody of the ritual. 29. Rumpf, "Robinson," pp. 84-89, compares CMA 26.549 with another Anakreonic Pig Painter vase. 30. Caskey and Beazley, Boston, pp. 55-56, discount the "disguise" theory. 31. For the calyx krater by the Kleophrades Painter (Rome, coll. Curtius), see Caskey and Beazley, Boston, p. 57.</page><page sequence="25">32. Beazley compiled a list of twenty seven Anakreonic images, mostly painted between 490 and 450 BC. Anakreon is present on thirteen of them and named on three. Beazley's list (in Caskey and Beazley, Boston, pp. 58-60) actually contains twenty-eight items. The last, known only by description, was either lost or duplicated a vase already listed. The list includes our Cleveland Poet vase, a Pig Painter pelike in Rhodes, two in the manner of the Pig Painter, several by the school of Myson, and one by the Agrigento Painter. 33. H. A. Shapiro ("Courtship Scenes in Attic Vase-Painting," American Journal of Archaeology 85, no. 2 [April 1981]: 1 37-1 39) discusses this new practice in Greek society. 34. Boardman, "Booners," p. 67. On pp. 65-67, he gives a brief account of Anakreon's life. 35. An eighteenth-century social club in London, the Anacreonic Society, commissioned John Stafford Smith to compose a musical score for a poem "To Anacreon in Heaven," glorifying the delights of wine, music, and love. In 1 814 Francis Scott Key wrote the lyrics to "The Star-Spangled Banner," setting them to Smith's 1 777 Anakreonic melody, which Key had also used for an earlier poem. By the early 1 800s at least eighty-four different poems had been set to it in the United States. Academic American Encyclopedia, s.v. "Star Spangled Banner," gives the history of John Stafford Smith's melody. Luigi Cherubini's opera Anacreon reflects the Greek poet's importance to the world of opera as well. 36. C. M. Bowra, Greek Lyric Poetry: From Alcman to Simonides (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1961), p. 303, by permission of Oxford University Press; for a helpful examination of Anakreon's poetry, consult pp. 268-307. 37.

Maas (Stringed Instruments, p. 124) describes it as a type of tenor lyre. 39. Boardman ("Booners," pp. 62-64) differentiates the construction of the barbitos lyre and points out that it is the only type carried by dressed Anakreonic revelers. Maas (Stringed Instruments, pp. 116-120) cites fifth-century sources to support its Anakreonic origin and speculates regarding festivals in which men dress as women. 40. Shapiro ("Courtship Scenes," pp. 140, 143) states that calling this dress "effeminate" is to impose a modern prejudice. 41. Boardman ("Booners," pp. 47-50) increased the number of vases display ing Anakreonic iconography to forty-six. His list identifies vases included by Beazley and adds several Mannerist works. Cleveland's vase, CMA 26.549, is no. 33 (no. 21 on Beazley's list). For the headdress, see pp. 50-56. De Vries ("East Meets West," pp. 32-39) suggests that Anakreon adopted this mode of dress while on Samos with Polykrates. 42. Boardman, "Booners," pp. 56-61. 43. The Basel cup (ARV2 414.30) is no. 19 on Boardman's list. He analyzes earrings and Greek parasols ("Booners," pp. 61-62, 64-65). He also points out (ibid., p. 65) that the men do not don garments or accessories that are known to be strictly feminine, warning of the errors an uninformed person might make in interpreting a picture of a bearded Scotsman in kilts. 44. Concerning the Austin Pig Painter vase (1980.39, ARV2 562.1), consult J. D. Beazley, "Notes on the Vases in Castle Ashby," Papers of the British School at Rome 11 (1929): 21-23; and John Boardman and Martin Robertson, Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum.

Boardman and Robertson (CVA Castle Ashby, p. 30) date it ca. 470 BC. 46. On the Austin vessel, the Pig Painter now works with a group of three, rather than two, main characters. Although the block of horses includes two tails and three heads, the number of legs tells us that four horses pull the chariot. The drawing of hands holding objects is more believable than that on the Cam bridge pelike. 47. For the Brussels krater (R 305, ARV2 563.5), see F. Mayence and V. Verhoogen, Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum. Belgium, fasc. 2 (Brussels: Musees Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire, n.d.), p. 8. 48. Detroit, 24.120, ARV2 569.43, ca. 470-465 BC. Beazley originally attrib uted the Cleveland Poet vase to the Leningrad Painter. Moon (Midwestern, p. 1 67) explains that similarities in the work of the two artists occurred early in their careers when they were closely associated with Myson. Generally, the proportions of the Pig Painter's figures are more elongated and attenuated. He defined ankle bones with tiny circles, as the Leningrad Painter sometimes did. 49. Eve Borsook (The Mural Painters of Tuscany: From Cimabue to Andrea del Sarto, 2d ed. [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980], pp. 111-1 13) dates the fresco between ca. 1460 and ca. 1475 and documents the interest in Roman antiquities shared by Pollaiuolo and Giovanni Lanfredini, one of the owners of the villa. She describes in detail the room in which the fresco is located and analyzes its condition. Uncovered beneath plaster in 1897, the fresco suffered a disastrous restoration. For important pre-restoration descriptions, see Mary Logan Berenson, "Decouverte d'une fresque de Pollaiuolo," Chronique des arts 36 (1897): 343-344; and Maud Cruttwell, Antonio Pollaiuolo (London: Duckworth, 1907), pp. 117-120. 50. The fresco today is in abysmal con dition. It extends around a low doorway approximately six feet in height, smaller than a standard American door. The figures are roughly four feet tall and set only slightly above eye level. Illusionis tic architectural decoration fills the dado below the figures, while above them stretches a decorative frieze of ribbonlike swags below garlands of fruit. The composition perhaps ran along the length of the wall. 51. For the relationship between the Renaissance artists and particular works of antique sculpture, the best compendium is Phyllis Pray Bober and Ruth Rubinstein, Renaissance Artists and Antique Sculpture: A Handbook of Sources (London: Harvey Miller Pub lishers, 1986). For specifics regarding Pollaiuolo and the antique, see Laurie Fusco, "Antonio Pollaiuolo's Use of the Antique," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 42 (1979): 257 n. 2. 52. Cornelius Vermeule (in European Art and the Classical Past [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1964], pp. 1 5, 181 n. 42) makes this important observation and gives examples. He then notes that this contradicts his ear lier statement (p. 14) regarding the scarcity of Greek painted vases in Italy before 1600. E. H. Gombrich docu ments the beginning of this dialogue to the dugento, analyzing the relationship between the ornament in a Berlinghieri panel painting and the subsidiary deco ration on Greek vases in "Bonaventura Berlinghieri's Palmettes," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 39 (1976): 234-236. 53. The humanist Antonio Ivano da Sarzana, writing in 1 466, reported spe cific finds of numerous partially broken clay vases with pleasing appearances. For an English translation, see Creighton E. Gilbert, Italian Art 1400-1500, Sources and Documents (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1922), 181; the original text is in Art Bulletin 48 (1966): 96. The sentence could refer to either Etruscan or Greek vases. Andre Chastel ("L"Etruscan Revival' du XVe Siecle," Revue arch6ologique 1 [1959]: 167-1 72) considers the availability and influence of Greek and Etruscan vases.</page><page sequence="27">Both he and Fern Rusk Shapley ("A Student of Ancient Ceramics, Antonio Pollajuolo," Art Bulletin 2 [Sept. 1919 June 1920]: 78-79) stress the impor tance of the 1282 writing by Ristoro d'Arezzo, in which he describes ceram ics excavated near Arezzo, some of which were Greek painted vases. 54. Leopold Ettlinger (Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo [Oxford: Phaidon, 1978], pp. 36 and 145) refutes the possible relationship, stating that the Renais sance masters did not study red-figure vase-painting, and that in the fifteenth century Greek vases were not used for models. His evidence is Vermeule's statement in Classical Past (p. 14), contradicted by Vermeule himself (ibid., pp. 15, 181 n. 42). 55. Noble (Techniques, p. 146) remarks that some Attic vases have been marked with Etruscan graffiti, which emphasizes the wide exportation of the vases. 56. Chastel ("'Etruscan Revival,'" p. 1 71) explains that both Greek red figure ceramics and Aretine relief pot tery were attributed to the Etruscans and entered the Medici collections as Tuscan antiquities. For the belief that the Greek vases were Etruscan, see R. M. Cook, Greek Painted Pottery (London: Metheun, 1972), p. 289. 57. Concerning the Vasari gift, see Shapley, "Student," p. 79; and Chastel, "'Etruscan Revival,"' p. 172, who sug gests the date. Giorgio, a potter, worked at reproducing the Aretine technique of low relief. The family name is from "Vasajo," the vase maker; refer to Giorgio Vasari, Vasari on Technique, trans. Louisa S. Maclehose (New York: Dover, 1960), p. 156 n. 4. 58. Eugene Muntz (Les collections des M6dicis au XVe siecle [Paris: Jules Rouam, 1888], pp. 57-58) documents the Barbero offer, presenting part of the text of this letter from Poliziano to Lorenzo. Michael Vickers ("A Greek Source for Antonio Pollaiuolo's Battle of the Nudes and Hercules and the Twelve Giants," Art Bulletin 59, no. 2 [June 1977]: 187) interprets the size of the vase to mean that it is a large column krater. 59. Drs. Fusco and Corti have most generously allowed me to mention their discovery, which is forthcoming in an essay about Lorenzo de' Medici. 60. Fusco ("Pallaiuolo's Use of the An tique," pp. 259-260) comments on problems in a comparison of a fallen warrior from a Greek vase with Pollaiuolo's Hercules and the Giants. Richard Cocke ("Art and Politics in a Drawing by Antonio Pollaiuolo," Master Drawings 22 [1984]: 1 74-1 75) states that the composition of Pollaiuolo's drawing Prisoner before a Judge de pends on those from Etruscan vases. 61. Louise S. Richards ("Antonio Pollaiuolo: Battle of Naked Men," CMA Bulletin 55 [March 1968]: 62-70) analyzes the technical quality of Cleveland's engraving, the only existing impression printed from Pollaiuolo's original unchanged plate. Ettlinger (Pollaiuolo, pp. 146-147) gives addi tional bibliography.

Mauro Natale [Milan: Electa, 1984], pp. 196-199) presents a convinc ing analogy between a figure in the engraving and one in an antique marble satyr group. 109</page><page sequence="28">110 63. Shapley ("Student," pp. 78-86) pro poses the Battle relationship as well as several others. Alfred H. Barr, Jr. ("A Drawing by Antonio Pollaiuolo," in Art Studies: Medieval, Renaissance, and Modern [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1926], p. 74) agrees with Shapley that Greek vase-painting is the source for the style of the figures. Maurizio Lorber ("L'anatomia dinamica del Pollajuolo ed il problema dei codici visivi," Critica d'arte, 6th ser., 55, nos. 2-3 [1990]: 46, fig. 9a-c) affirms the source with a comparative illustration. 64. Chastel ("'Etruscan Revival,"' p. 170) compares the image with descriptions of vases in the writings of Ristoro d'Arezzo. 65. Vickers ("Greek Source," p. 1 85) illustrates figures on a calyx krater by the Niobid Painter (Louvre G 341) that have clear parallels in Pollaiuolo's compositions. This krater was found in Orvieto; for the Italian provenance of many of the Niobid Painter's kraters, see ibid., p. 187. 66. Borsook (Mural Painters, p. 111) connects the figures in the Battle of the Nudes with the revelers in the Villa La Gallina, emphasizing that both works are accurately observed studies of the nude in violent action, drawn with electric vitality. Emison ("Word Made Naked," p. 264) sees major differences in action, expression of emotion, and physiognomy between them. 67. Fusco agrees that the figure/ground contrast and the lively action on vases could have been studied by Pollaiuolo, but feels that convincing comparisons are lacking; see her entry in Jay A. Levenson, Konrad Oberhuber, and Jacquelyn L. Sheehan, Early Italian Engravings from the National Gallery of Art (Washington: National Gallery of Art, 1973), p. 78 n. 34. For an affirma tion of the Dionysiac character of the fresco and correlation of figure types, see Borsook, Mural Painters, pp. 112 11 3. Werner Meinhof ("Leonardos Hieronymus," Repertorium fur kunst wissenschaft 52 [1931]: 105) proposes as precedent for the fresco an antique relief in the Medici-Riccardi Palace. Fritz Saxl ("Rinascimento dell'Antichita," Repertorium fur Kunstwissenschaft 43 [1922]: 222) illustrates his comparison. Chastel ("'Etruscan Revival,"' pp. 167 1 69) compares the fresco imagery with Etruscan prototypes. He suggests specific affinities with painted images in the tombs of Tarquinia, realizing, however, that these tombs were discovered much later. He describes Pollaiuolo's contact with the Florentine humanists who could have familiarized him with antique ceramics and recently discovered Etruscan tombs. He suggests references to vase-painting in humanist writings on p. 171. Emison ("Word Made Naked," p. 265) affirms Pollaiuolo's access to the humanists, especially Marsilio Ficino. 68. Shapley ("Student," pp. 80-83) pro poses not a specific vase but types of figures which often appear on vases in scenes of Bacchic revels. Barr ("Draw ing," p. 74) agrees that Greek vase-paint ing is the source for the figurative style of the fresco. Others reject Shapley's suggested connection with vase-painting. Ettlinger (Pollaiuolo, p. 36) holds that the appearance of the original fresco with flesh-coloured and modeled figures would have been closer to that of an ancient relief than a Greek vase. He submits (p. 145) that the current state of preservation of the frescoes, retaining mainly the outlines of figures and traces of architecture, misled Shapley into supposing a derivation from Greek vase-painting. Roberto Weiss (The Re naissance Discovery of Classical Antiq uity [Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1969], p. 189 n. 7) finds Shapley's theories unconvincing. 69. Erwin Panofsky, Renaissance and Renascenses in Western Art (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 1 76; see also p. 152 n. 2. Kenneth Clark (The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form [Garden City: Doubleday, 1959], p. 379) believes that they represent figures from Etruscan pottery enlarged to the scale of wall painting. Cocke ("Art and Politics," pp. 1 74-1 75) agrees that the composition of the La Gallina frescoes was intended to emulate those found on Etruscan vases.</page><page sequence="29">70. Vickers, "Greek Source," pp. 186 187; this painter is a follower of the Niobid Painter. The volute krater comes from the excavations at the necropolis of Spina, discovered in 1922. Also from the same excavation, which is particu larly rich in fifth-century BC vases, are column kraters by the Pig Painter and the Leningrad Painter. For the Spina finds, consult Nereo Alfieri, Spina: Museo archeologico nazionale di Ferrara, 1 (Bologna: Calderini, 1979). 71. For illustrations, see Shapley, "Stu dent," pi. V, fig. 4. Cook (Painted Pot tery, p. 287) considers that Renaissance artists may have thought vase-painting primitive because many examples lacked both oblique views and model ing with light and shade, but the Pig Painter's concern for foreshortening might have been of great interest. 72. The closest parallels that I have found for Pollaiuolo's dancer with up raised leg, other than the Cleveland Poet vase reveler, are also on red-figure vases. The volute krater T.579 from Spina, from which Vickers cites a satyr as precedent for the far right fresco dancer, bears the figure of another satyr with an upraised leg. Neither of the arms are raised and, while the body is frontal, the leg resting on the ground shows an attempt at foreshortening. The figure is not convincingly balanced; the foot is not placed under the head. For an illustration, see P. E. Arias, Cor pus Vasorum Antiquorum: Ferrara, Museo nazionale 1 (Italy 37) (Rome: Istituto Poligrafico dello Stato, 1963), pl. 10. A column krater by a painter of the Mannerist school (Lecce 602) fea tures a scene of satyrs crushing grapes; one satyr raises his left leg with a sharp bend in the knee and attempted fore shortening similar to the Cleveland dancer; his lower body does not show the torsion of the Cleveland reveler. Both arms are raised; the right foot ap pears to be positioned directly under the head. It is reproduced in P. Romanelli, Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum: Lecce, Museo provinciale Castromediano 1 (Italy 4) (Rome: L'Erma di Bretschneider, 1979), pi. 6. 73. Fusco ("Use of the Antique," pp. 257-263) makes a helpful analysis of Pollaiuolo's manner of working with antique motifs: he did not copy a motif exactly but habitually varied the motifs he repeated; the figures he selected were those with directional thrust and rhythmic flexion. Vickers ("Greek Source," p. 184) reports that the Niobid Painter often showed faces in three quarter view. Perhaps the head of the dancer was influenced by a figure of the Niobid Painter, while the body resulted from a study of the Pig Painter's work. 74. At present the background is a lively, delicate, slightly grayed green. According to Cruttwell (Pollaiuolo, p. 117) the restorer added the colored background; the original background color is not described. 75. Cruttwell (ibid., p. 117) described the incised outlines before their restora tion and reported that the restorer coars ened them. The condition of the work today makes the incisings very difficult to see. 76. The bunches of grapes in the frieze above the fresco reinforce the Dionysiac context of Pollaiuolo's danc ers. Emison ("Word Made Naked," p. 261) reminds us that in Pollaiuolo's era limited precedent existed for action scenes with no recognizable story. The Poet vase furnishes a strong paradigm. 77. According to the curatorial files for CMA 26.549, the Museum purchased the Poet vase in 1926 from an Italian dealer in Naples; no additional information is known regarding its provenance. A number of the Pig Painter's vases have findspots in Italy. 111</page></plain_text>
