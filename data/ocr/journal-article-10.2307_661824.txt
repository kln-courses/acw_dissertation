BEALS INTRODUCTION (By ECP) THE Pueblo clowns or, in Bandelier's not altogether adequate terms, the Delight makers are well known figures; outside of Sonora the Mayo and Yaqui clowns were unknown until Dr Beals made their acquaintance in 1931 in the course of his study of the Cahita-speaking peoples. The Sonora clowns come out during the Lenten season and at that time in 1932 I had joined Beals at Navojoa for a glimpse at the Cahita culture as it might be compared with that of the Pueblos. It was the Fifth Friday, the Fiesteros were making the stations of the Cross at San Ignacio, and we had just joined the procession of the image- carrying women, the rezador and his acolytes, and the group dedicated to the annual service, when the Fariseos appeared on the scene to burlesque the devout and "play" around them. These masked men teased one an- other; they fell over dogs and rolled in the dust; they displayed mock fear; they set a doll on the ground to venerate it as a saint; and they simulated eating and drinking the excreta they would pretend to catch in their wooden machete from the body of passing burro or horse or man or woman, even of one kneeling in prayer. This last diversion was a variant on the filth eat- ing and drinking practices of the Pueblo clowns, otherwise every new trick or bedevilment that was enacted on the outskirt of that religious procession was one I had seen in our Southwest. The Fariseos behaved just as would the Koyemshi were there Catholic processionals at Zufii which the Koyem- shi had to attend. I gasped in amazement, inwardly-the dust was smother- ing. Before Dr Beals gives a fuller account of the behavior of the Fariseos or Chapaiyeka and of their organization let us survey briefly what we know of the clowning groups of the Pueblos,' as a convenience for compari- 1 Principal sources are: Hopi: A.

The groups vary considerably in each Pueblo tribe. PUEBLO CLOWNS (By ECP) Among the Hopi of First and Third Mesas and the Tewa of First Mesa -we are not well informed about Second Mesa2-there are four distinct clown groups, five if we include the Nata'shka and Cha'vaiyo kachinas-the Chiirkii'wimkya3 who wear their hair like the young girls, bunched on each side, or who wear a wig, and paint black around eyes and mouth or red stripes across the 'face (these reddened ones with red stained rabbit fur at their ears are called Hopi Chiirkii'wimkya); the Pai'yakyamii or Koyala (Kossa) of the immigrant Tewa, who paint in black and white bands with black circles around mouth and eyes and wear their hair in two vertical pokes or horns bound with corn husk; the Koyi'msi (also called Ta'chfikt) who wear a knobby cotton mask smeared with red clay with turkey feathers tied to the knobs, and a shabby black woolen loin cloth, hardly a kilt, over their reddened body; and the Pi'ptiiyakyamii or "ar- Notes on Zufti, AAA-M 4: 153, 172, 173, 229-37, 1917; The Zuiii Adoshl6 and Suuk', AA 18 338-47, 1916; Winter and Summer Dance Series in Zufii in 1918, UC-PAAE 17, No. 3: 179' 181, 182, 184, 189, 191, 193, 194, 1922.

At Shipau'lovi, Fewkes de- scribes the Chiirkii'wTmkya as painted yellow, body and face, with two parallels of red across the face. They wear a wig of sheepskin (A Few Summer Ceremonials at the Tusayan Pueblos, 11). 3 The Third Mesa picture of the clowns is in general similar to that of First Mesa but de- tails and, in one case, nomenclature vary. I am giving these as of First Mesa. Curiously enough one type of clown, who is called Chiirkii'wimkya on First Mesa (striped yellow and black, wearing a sheepskin cape), on Third Mesa are called Pai'yakyamii.</page><page sequence="3">PARSONS-BEALS] SACRED CLOWNS 493 rivals" who wear all kinds of grotesque masks and clothes or appear with- out masks, according to the rbles they are for the time being enacting. These Pi'ptiiyakaymii are mummers who perform improvised farces or come- dies at the kachina dances. The Pi'ptiiyakyamii and Koyi'msI are without permanent organization (the Koyi'msI have a chief in whose house they may assemble); kiva members volunteer; they appear during dances or ceremonies which have been borrowed from Zufii, the Koyi'msI being of course the Zufii Koyemshi and the Pi'ptii probably carrying on the bur- lesque activities of the other Zufii clown group, the Ne'wekwe. The Pai'ya- kyamii (Keresan: Paiyatyamu, youths) are the Kossa or Koshare of the Eastern Tewa or Keres. Formerly they had a permanent organization, a chieftaincy, and they are possessed of altar paraphernalia. They consider themselves the leaders and fathers of the kachina. The Chiirkii have a sort of indirect organization;4 the parts may be taken by members of the Singers or of the Wii'wiichim societies, two of the four town groups into which every male Hopi is initiated. All Singers and WiU'wiichIm function as clowns5 in the joint ceremony of the initiation of the youths to the extent of singing obscene and taunting songs against the society women' and now and again smearing them with filth, to be in turn drenched with urine or foul water.7 The Singers carry vulva shaped sticks. This quasi-relationship to the women's societies is found again between the clown groups and women's societies of Jemez (one of the two non-Hopi pueblos which are possessed of women's societies), only at Jemez the relationship is the more sober one of prayer-stick making; the clown groups make the prayer-sticks the women deposit. The Nata'shka are a group of kachinas who figure as bogeys to discipline the children in the Powamu ceremony.8 Cha'vaiyo is a 4 Formerly they had a ti'poni or chiefly fetich and inferably a chief (Stephen, 182) but even in Stephen's day this organization had lapsed. 6 The Singers are also seen burlesquing a dance episode in the women's Mamzrau cere- mony (E. C. Parsons, The Hopi W6w6chim Ceremony in 1920, AA 25: 171, 1923). Singers and Wii'wtichtmtti talk in a high falsetto and make jests when they distribute rabbits to certain houses (Stephen, 984). 6 On Third Mesa only the Wii'wiichim society did this and only against the Mamzrau society women (Titiev). SOn one occasion three women were trapped and made to play clown with the men clowns. Their obscene humor was quite up to the men's (Stephen, 365 ff.). Hopi society women perform a dance burlesque of the men's war dance and many other burlesques. 8 On third Mesa they may come out at other times, as do their homologues at Zufii. Among the Hopi there are several other kachina (more numerous on Third Mesa than on First Mesa) who play clown, presenting comic interludes in their sober kachina per- formances and playing with the regular clowns. Hehe'ya might be described as the Kachina clown.</page><page sequence="4">494 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.s., 36, 1934 slayer kachina who once lived with his offspring, the Nata'shka, in the San Francisco mountains. Corresponding to the Nata'shka and Cha'vaiyo are the Zufii Natashku, the Atoshle couple, and the more dreadful and less commonly impersonated Suyuki who are to be identified with the Hopi Suyuk and Natashku. Bogey kachinas aside, we get a picture of Zufii clowns which is quite different from the Hopi picture, not so much in behavior as in functions and organization. Among the Hopi the clowns do not cure; they have no distinctive weather ritual;9 what permanent organization they once had has been allowed to lapse; they are little but comedians or attendants upon the kachina. But the Zufii Koyemshi and Ne'wekwe are vital organizations closely integrated into the ceremonial life. The Koyemshi are ten men selected from society or kiva to serve for one year. After the lapse of a few years the same group may serve again. The Koyemshi make monthly prayer-stick offerings for moisture; they have to attend the summer kachina dances for rain; they "play" and perform rituals at the November ceremonial of Koko awia or Advent of the gods, generally known as Shalako, when their "retreat" is the longest observed by any of the ceremonial groups and concludes with exacting privations of speech, sleep, and food. Their masks are in the cus- tody of one of the high priesthoods, the rain priesthood of the west. They make domiciliary visits to receive gifts of food in their fawnskin bag; at the close of Advent or Shalako each is given a great number of presents by his father's clanspeople. The Koyemshi do not cure, but they have supernatu- ral powers and are held in awe by all the townspeople. "They are the most feared and the most beloved of all Zufii impersonations."'1 The Zufii Ne'wekwe are also possessed of black magic, but they are a regular curing society. Only a part of the society act as clowns. They have a ceremony of initiation, held in winter, and they are expected to attend the winter kachina dances. They are in charge of a set of grotesque kachina masks, the Hewahewa masks," and when these are worn by a dance group a 9 At Oraibi they are said to bring wind; formerly they performed a ceremony against wind, in March (Titiev). At Walpi they may be asked to bring rain (Stephen, 370). On First Mesa a dream of clowns being whipped by kachina is a sign of cold; a dream of clowns danc- ing is a sign of rain. 10 R. L. Bunzel, Introduction to Zuffi Ceremonialism, BAE-R47: 521, 1929-1930. 11 Of the making, wearing and care of grotesque or burlesque masks at Zufli and other pueblos we have scant information; but it seems probable that they are not considered danger- ous and so are lacking in taboo. (See E. C. Parsons, Hopi and Zufii Ceremonialism, AAA-M 39: 84, f.n. 319, 1933.) This does not apply to the Zuffi Koyemshi masks; but then there is a false set of Koyemshi masks which are used at the less important dances, a practice applied to other potent kachina masks. At Santo Domingo there is a large group of kachina masks which, like</page><page sequence="5">PARSONS-BEALS] SACRED CLOWNS 495 Ne'wekwe is leader. The farces and burlesques of the Ne'wekwe are im- provised, whereas the games and buffoonery of the Koyemshi are for the most part ritualistic or stereotype. The chief of the Ne'wekwe has to make monthly prayer-stick offerings for moisture; without mask he impersonates the supernatural patron of the society in the dramatization of the Return of the Corn Maidens enacted at the close of Advent. In appearance and behavior the Ne'wekwe are to be equated with the Koshare of the Eastern pueblos.12 But the Koshare or Kossa of the Keres or Tewa do not cure." They play the clown, they attend upon the kachina and upon Saint's day dancers, and in some pueblos they take charge of field work for the Town chief and of ritual hunts. The Koshare (and Kurena) of Cochiti have even been called managing societies.'4 The Kurena have often been referred to as a clowning society; they may alternate as managers with the Koshare and they have a close relationship with the kachina, but they do not clown.' The seasonal alternation of Koshare and Kurenal' and the association of the two groups with the double kiva system of the Keres, the Koshare with Turquoise kiva and the Kurena with Squash kiva, would appear to fill what need of moiety expression the Eastern Keres have borrowed from their neighbors, the Tewa. In myth the Tewa associate Kossa with both moieties, with both Sum- mer People and Winter People, and the Kossa act as clowns and as scouts. Actually there is but a single Kossa organization and a single supernatural patron who is represented by a small anthropomorphic image of stone. the Hewahewa, are kept by the clown societies. They do not require the preliminary rite of emesis in order to be worn and they may be seen by white people. These kachina live in the south, at Gowawaima. One of them is called Rik'us, el Rico. Kachina masks from Mexico! 12 See Stephen, 945, 947-48, for a comparison between Ne'wekwe who are visiting First Mesa, and the Singers. The Koyemshi appear in some of the Eastern pueblos, but merely as kachina dancers or scouts. 13 Except in Laguna where they cure for lightning shock and possibly for other disasters or for disease. But the ceremonial life of Laguna is so disintegrated that various functions have had to be undertaken by makeshift groups. An analogous situation is found at Namb6 where Santa Clara Kossa have been called upon in curing. 14 Goldfrank, Cochiti, 42-43. 16 However I have included the Kurena in our comparative table because their activities are so close to the non-clowning activities of the clowning group. The Kurena have been equated with the Shi'wannakwe society of Zufii (E. C. Parsons, Census of the Shi'wannakwe Society of Zufii, AA 21: 333-34, 1919). 18 At Santo Domingo, the Koshare hold their annual ceremony, also initiation, in Febru- ary; the Quiraina, in September. At Laguna, "the Kurena lead the people back from the harvest," which is why at Jemez they are called Ice society.</page><page sequence="6">496 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.s., 36, 1934 Originally the image was of dough, a not insignificant detail in view of the dough images of the Aztecs. The prototypes or supernatural patrons of the Zufii Ne'wekwe and of the Keresan Koshare were created from human cuticle or from Corn Mother cuticle, i.e., from corn meal. The supernatural patrons of all the Pueblo clown groups are anthropomorphic. With one exception the groups have no relationship with the spirit animals, the animals of the curing and hunt- ing societies and Rattlesnake. The Horned or Plumed serpent is a water snake and with him the clowns do have dealings. Koyi'msi figure in the Horned water serpent dramatization by the Hopi, and the Tewa Kossa perform ritual to control Avanyo, the sender of flood in the Rio Grande valley. Membership in the Kossa or Koshare (Kurena) group is primarily through parental dedication in childhood, a sick infant or little boy will be "given to them." Trespass past or within an ash or meal line or circle, "their house," is another widespread means of recruiting, sometimes merely for the immediate ceremonial occasion. Dedication of sick boy babies is customary also at Taos in recruiting the Black Eyes. The chieftaincy of the Taos Black Eyes belongs within one of the north side kivas and the membership is largely from the same kiva; but an infant whose membership in another kiva is already established may be given to the Black Eyes-. The dedication is made on either of the two ceremonial occasions at which Black Eyes "come out," on Saint Geronimo's day, the patron saint's day, when the Black Eyes climb the pole they have brought in and erected,"1 and on the day the Deer dance is given, Christmas or Kings' day. At the Deer dance throughout the morning Black Eyes are running from house to house collecting food presents; in their courses out- side they shout and gesture, they also gather together to sing. They may throw one of their men into the river where the ice is thin or they may dramatize a deer hunt, stalking a Black Eye wearing deerhide and horns, killing him and loading him on the back of another Black Eye. At the after- noon dance they burlesque the dancers, even the sacred Deer Mothers, and they seize the smaller deer impersonations, the little boys, throw them across their shoulders and try to reach their kiva before being caught by the lookers-on. They also give small bits of venison to the women dancers of the Saint's day dance as they stand around on the edge of the Deer dance. During this day no war captains are in evidence; the Black Eyes police. 17 Pole climbing is practiced by the Koshare of the Tewan pueblo of San Ildefonso; it has not been noted in the other eastern pueblos and it does not figure in the ritual games of the western pueblos.</page><page sequence="7">PARSONS-BEALS] SACRED CLOWNS 497 The Black Eyes paint in black and white bands like the Koshare, but wear their hair tied up each side, something like the Hopi Chiirkii. Formerly the organization was possessed of two masks, perhaps more, which are kept in a cave, in charge of the family that was then and still is in charge of the Turtle dance, a maskless kachina dance. The masks are of deer hide with two erect points, probably with little decoration. These are the only masks known to the Taos people. It seems probable that they were once worn as clown masks in connection with the Turtle dance, possibly by that one of the paramount chiefs who was in charge of masks and dance. The masks are sacrosanct and the town was racked when one of them was "lost." The Isletans have similar masks which are worn by the six Te'en or Grandfathers, three Black Eyes, three Red Eyes, representing each moiety and including the Town chief. The Grandfathers are a permanent group that comes out to play at maskless kachina dances. We may note that the Town chiefs of San Ildefonso are Kossa and that the chief of the some- time winter moiety of the Tewa of First Mesa was chief of the Kossa or Koyala. Prominent townsmen in various pueblos have been observed play- ing Kossa or Koshare. Except at Isleta this would seem to be not a set political function, merely a trend, possibly based on the part once played by the clown groups in war, possibly because the politically minded are quick to take advantage of the fear always inspired by the clowns as a means of social control. The obscene behavior of the clowns may be considered as a war trait, particularly their formal obscenity towards women and their eating or drinking of filth and stereotype gluttony. Also their backward speech, saying the contrary of what they mean. Backward speech, eating or drink- ing in excess or things ordinarily repugnant, and playing "practical jokes" on old women, etc., were all items in the foolhardy behavior of certain Plains warrior societies. One of the war chiefs of Isleta is characterized by backward speech, and the warrior among the Zufii Koyemshi does the re- verse of what would be expected of a war chief. Ducking in water is an- other trait common to the clowns and the military societies of the Plains.18 The Pueblo war groups or chieftaincies have disintegrated more than any other part of the social organization, due to the passing of war. But there are still positive relics or memories in some pueblos of the sometime war or associated war activities of the clowns. The K'ashale of Acoma, now almost extinct, were managers of the Scalp ceremony and the Gumeyoichi today act as scouts in the dramatization of the fight with the kachina. The 18 R. H. Lowie, The Tobacco Society of the Crow Indians, AMNH-AP 21: 113, 1919; Military Societies of the Crow Indians, AMNH-AP 11: 205, 1913.</page><page sequence="8">498 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.s., 36, 1934 Kashare of Laguna helped prepare the scalp, they attended on the scalp- takers and they performed a general exorcism in the Scalp dance by shooting off arrows after the people spat into their quivers. In the dance of the war- riors the Kashare were in charge of one kiva, the Kurena in charge of the other, and they led the dance groups.19 The extinct Red Eyes of Taos had the function of getting people out to take part in the Scalp dance. Hopi and Zufii clowns have sometimes killed the dogs they chased, the Zufii clowns referring to their victims as Navaho. The scalps of Isleta are kept in the ceremonial houses of the moiety chiefs whose organizations furnish the Grandfathers and the impromptu K'apyo who play clown parts in the Spruce dance, the maskless kachina dance borrowed from Zufii. We may note that these K'apyo sing improvised satirical songs against townspeople. The term K'apyo appears to be related to Chapio, Tsabiyo, the term applied by the Keres to a mask which comes out on Saint's days and is reputed to come from the south. At Laguna in burlesquing a Mexican, Chapio may.ride a horse; he carries whip or lariat; on his mask is painted a cross.20 The Tsabiyo, or Abuelos, grandfathers, come out with the Mata- china dancers at Cochiti and at San Juan. At San Juan most of their by- play is with a little boy who wears horns and is called Torito, little bull. Abuelo leads Torito by a cord and finally kills and quarters him. Abuelo wears a hide mask,21 painted with American designs or words. He carries a whip. Two Abuelos come out in the Matachina given at Alcalde, a Mexi- can settlement three miles distant. They play just like the Abuelos of San Juan. This Matachina mask does not speak, he carries on purely in panto- mime. There is a burlesque of the Matachina at Santo Domingo including a burlesque bull and bull fighter, which is probably performed by the Chapios, although Dumarest does not so state.22 The Tewa and the Tanoans of Isleta and Taos apply the same term to a mountain dwelling cannibal giant who preyed on people, particularly on children. The Cha'vaiyo and 19 Boas, 293, 294. 20 Goldfrank, Two Pueblo Feasts, 189-91. 21 Similar to the Abuelo mask figured at Cochiti (Dumarest, pl. VII). 22 Sundaro (Sp., Soldado) is an elaborate annual dramatization of the arrival of the Span- iards which includes dances, songs, a bull fight and horse masks called Santiago and San Geronimo. Sundaro is comparable with the bull performance at the fiesta of Porcingula at Jemez and with the comedies of the Hopi Pi'ptiiyakyamii. Sundaro is well integrated into the whole ceremonial life, but the clown societies appear to have no connection with it. Compare a saint's day celebration in the Aztec Huaxteca in which appear Santiago's hobby horse, a bull mask, los Negros or two masked clowns, and los Viejos, an old couple in masks (F. Starr, Notes upon the Ethnography of Southern Mexico, Proc. Davenport Acad. Sciences 9: 70- 72, 1901-1903).</page><page sequence="9">PARSONS-BEALS] SACRED CLOWNS 499 Nata'shka kachina of the Hopi, impersonations of the early monsters, and the Zufii Atoshle (grandfather) and Nata'shku masks are related in function to those eastern impersonations. All are child bogeys or disciplinarians23 rather than clowns, but in some cases their behavior corresponds to that of the clowns. (In Table 1 are given details necessarily omitted in the fore- going survey.) In general the clowns have a punitive and policing function in cere- monial matters and through their license in speech and song a somewhat similar function in domestic matters, ridicule being a strong weapon among the Pueblos. Probably most Pueblos would rather be ducked than mocked. One of the foremost supernatural sanctions at Zufii is drought; if you break a taboo, rain will not fall on your field. The flood-sending water serpent in the Rio Grande valley has a punitive character. So it is quite consistent that the clowns should be associated with the water serpent and with the rain-sending and crop-bringing kachina. But the clown groups have direct weather-control and fertility functions, they themselves impersonate kachina or other supernaturals who live in springs or lakes. As scouts or war dance assistants the clowns have war functions. In short, through their police power, their magical power and their license in conduct, all fear-inspiring characters, social regulation is an outstanding function of the clown groups. Leadership for the kachina, including general attendance, is another important function. Last and not least, today certainly, the clowns amuse the people; they clown in our modern sense of the word. They attract more attention and arouse more interest than any other public performers. Dances and dramatizations are often held in a pueblo with few lookers-on, but almost everybody comes out to watch and enjoy the clowns. Their practical jokes or "horse-play" and their "personalities" and indecencies violate all ordinary rules of conduct in communities where casual bodily contacts are uncommon, where people are timid about gossiping, and where sexual expression in public is very restrained. The appeal to sexual emotion made by the clowns might be inferred from the myths about them-their supernatural patrons, Taiowa and Paiyetemu, are handsome seducers, "their father" Koyemshi is another Adam, his sister-wife another Eve; but clown play, obscene though it may appear, is so ritualistic, so stereo- type, that the anthropologist has usually interpreted it as phallic magic. It was not until I found Stephen's account of the Hopi burlesques that I 2 A striking case of discipline occurred on First Mesa in 1924. Some children who had just been whipped by the kachina were telling the younger children about it, so Cha'bio came out, dragging a man by a rope around his neck to demonstrate how an indiscreet child might be made off with (E. C. Parsons, The Ceremonial Calendar at Tewa, AA 28: 227 n. 45, 1926).</page><page sequence="10">500 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.s., 36, 1934 realized that here was no merely phallic representation like the dignified phallic kachina of Zufii called Ololowishkya, but a deliberate intention to give as outright a representation of sex as possible, for fun. Phallic magic is involved but the sex play or pantomime is probably also a stimulation, not to direct license, as the friars and the school teachers have ever thought, but to sex consciousness of a general sort, in groups where sex expression is very limited and sexual emotion is never openly manifested.24 Another form of emotional release through clown comedy or satire are the take-offs on other tribes or races-Navaho, Mexicans, Americans. It must be quite as gratifying to the Pueblo to ridicule the Navaho shaman, the Mexican bull fighter or the American tourist as it is for us to ridicule the obtuse Britisher, the French sport or the Negro. MAYO-YAQUI CLOWNS (By RLB) The most striking external manifestation of the life of the Indian communities of southern Sonora is the appearance of the clowns during Lent. Wearing grotesque masks and performing ridiculous antics, they run in small groups from house to house through the fields and woods, begging for food, money, or even a few gay flowers to adorn their already brightly painted masks. The many Mexicans who live among them, however, are unaware of the ramifications and significances of this behavior. These Sonoran clowns are part of a complex organization centering about extensive ceremonies culminating in a week-long dramatization of the life and death of Christ. Essentially the same, Mayo and Yaqui clowns yet differ in costume and especially in organization. Probably the less complex organization of the Mayo is largely due to greater cultural dis- integration. In Spanish discourse both peoples refer to the clowns as Fariseos (Phari- sees) or, at times, Diablos (devils). On certain occasions the Mayo call them Soldados del Pilato (soldiers of Pilate). The Yaqui call them natively Chapai- yeka (yeka, nose: chapai, no etymology), a word applied by the Mayo to the mask only. Organization.25 Membership is recruited through vows as a result of 24 This interpretation has been well expressed by Dr Bunzel in connection with Zulii lowning: "Undoubtedly the great delight in the antics of the clowns springs from the sense of release in vicarious participations in the forbidden" (Bunzel, Introduction to Zufii Ceremonial- ism, 521, n. 59). 1 Space limitations forbid more than the briefest r6sum6 of features most significant for comparative purposes. It is hoped to publish a complete account as part of a general study of the two peoples.</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, N.S., VOL. 36 Hoi (First Mesa) ORGANIZATION Ch1urku'wImkya: all members of Singers and W6w6chim societies may perform, Singers' chief acting as their chief; recruited by trap- ping; temporary performers from any kiva; disused tiponi kept in maternal house of Kachina clan.

Infrequently children are dedicated by their parents. Some members are acquired temporarily through capture. Membership is entirely male except for one woman member in the Yaqui village of Bican. Mayo clowns remain members for the duration of their vow, one or more years, usually three. Yaqui clowns are members for life, although not masking every year. Among the Mayo a newly pledged member goes to the Fariseo yaut (yaut, chief), who usually provides the goatskin for the mask. There is no initiation but if any of the Fariseos know a man has made the vow, he may be flogged by the chief if he fails to appear. He may not leave the group without permission even to secure food. The Yaqui have a simple initiation at a meeting beside the church the first Friday of Lent. Absent members are brought by force if necessary. Each new member sits in turn between two lines to be instructed in his duties. Later he is taken into the church by a godfather from among the clowns and a godmother from a woman's society. Mayo clowns have an annually elected chief (Fariseo yaut) with ex- tensive powers. Usually he is not a Fariseo and does not appear in costume. He carries a steel machete and braided rawhide whip. Theoretically he should be a "good" man; without vices, elderly, and capable of preserving order and obedience. His house is the meeting place of the group. A boy is usually selected as a drummer to accompany public appearances. The Yaqui chief, itom costumba yaut (our customs chief), is a perma- nent or semi-permanent official theoretically elected from within the clown group. Actually he is chosen by the maestro or singer and prayer leader. He is unmasked, carries a painted wooden sword and no whip. His qualifi- cations and functions are similar to those of the Mayo chiefs. Among the Mayo, Pilate appears during Holy Week at appropriate times. His assistants are Fariseos, called during this week Pilate's soldiers. The position changes annually. The Yaqui Pilate serves for life and boys are dedicated to the office. Consequently two or more Pilates may appear at once. There is a body of assistants including Kaifas (Kaifax, the judge), sergeants, corporals, a drummer, and two or three flute players. Some of these are unmarried men of the clown society (who may not wear a mask), others serve because of vows or infant dedication. Pilate also commands a group of "soldiers" divided into infantry and cavalry, men who have vowed to serve three years. Their only connection with the clowns is indirect. Costume. Outstanding are the masks; usually of goatskin, occasionally of peccary hide. Essentially they are squarish sacks with hair left for</page><page sequence="20">502 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.s., 36, 1934 moustache, beard, and sometimes on the face and back. Exaggerated fea- tures are painted on the front. A long thin nose of hide is sewn between the painted eyes, projecting straight forward. Large ovoid ears attached to the outer side and erect horns of hide, twelve inches or more long, complete the mask. Scroll designs cover the hairless portions and the Yaqui attach tufts of downy feathers to the tips of the horns and other parts. Yaqui masks diverge more from type than do Mayo masks. Some are "bull" masks; while two or three in each group wear "grandfather" masks with white hair all over except for indications of eyes, nose, and mouth. Both Yaqui and Mayo wear blankets over their ordinary clothing, folded and wrapped about the body with supporting cords over the should- ers. The Viejos (grandfathers; old men) mentioned affect old United States army overcoats. About the waist is a wide leather belt with pendant bits of metal on strips of rawhide, imitating belts worn by Pascolas dancers. Some Yaqui belts of plaited leather with pendant deer hoofs are identical with those of the Deer dancer. The ankles and lower legs are wrapped with strings of cocoon rattles like those of both Pascolas and Deer dancers. Regular accessories for the Mayo are a double pointed stick or lance and a wooden machete or sword, both painted red and green in wide bands. The Yaqui carry a wooden sword and a dagger. The Yaqui chief's wooden sword is broader bladed and is distinctly an emblem of authority, always picked up when a command is given or carried by a deputy executing orders. Extra paraphernalia includes dolls, often elaborately dressed as women, crudely carved human-like wooden figures, stuffed animals (burlesquing tobacco pouches of fiesta officials), improvised rattles imitating various kinds of dance rattles, prayer books, etc. With few exceptions all the equip- ment and costume except blankets and deer hoof belts is burned the morn- ing of Easter Saturday.26 When not in use Mayo masks are kept at the house of the owner. Yaqui masks are kept in a room of the church: here also are kept two masks which are preserved from one year to the next. Behavior. In most respects Yaqui and Mayo are identical. They may not speak when masked. Yaqui clowns (perhaps Mayo also) must carry the crucifix of a special rosary in their mouths27 and pray continually while 26 Compare the burning of the effigy of Judas on Sabado de Gloria in Spain and Mexico. At Jacaltenango, Guatemala, the effigy which is to be hanged wears a dance mask (0. La Farge and D. Byers.

The Mayo mask or unmask in the brush or behind a building; if this is impossible, they turn their backs. Yaqui clowns mask lying down, supporting themselves on one elbow. As the clowns beg and act as messengers while masked, they have many conventionalized signs. For example: Clapping sticks together lengthwise while holding them before the body-it is over. Finger tips to forehead, then bring forearm to horizontal-thanks. Pass both hands down torso-I am hungry. In taking a proffered gift, the left hand is used. The left hand "belongs to the devil."28 In general all possible actions are performed the reverse of normal. Other activities of clownish nature include: Imitating the various dancers in burlesque; reversing actions; taking fright at inconsequential things; running away; falling down; elaborate burlesques in pantomime; mock filth eating and drinking, etc. There is much variation among individual clowns in the fervor and originality displayed in their horseplay. Although no direct statement was made, sexual abstinence is effectively required of clowns as they may not leave the group at certain times and among the Yaqui may not even receive food directly from their wives or other women. Even small girls may not approach them. Clowns may do nothing "bad" during Lent; even bad language is banned. Violation of taboos causes the mask to stick permanently to the face and the ghosts may wander masked about the village after death. Functions. Primarily clowns are guardians of the image of Christ and his special servitors during Lent. Clowns accompany the image whenever it is taken from church. They are messengers, wood cutters, and water carriers at all small household fiestas. Yaqui clowns urge people from their houses to church and endeavor to prevent departure before the ceremonies ,conclude. They enforce all taboos as to costume, behavior, etc., during ceremonies. At household fiestas they take part in an elaborate ceremony point under the tongue when exposed to witchcraft. At Zufli kernels of black corn are also placed under the tongue against witches or ghosts (R. L. Bunzel, Zufii Ritual Poetry, BAE-R 47: 683).-ECP. 28 At Zufli and Isleta the use of the left hand (or foot) is habitual in connection with rites for the dead. Here it would be said "the left hand belongs to the dead." Among the Hopi all offerings are habitually made with the left hand and masks are put on and taken off with the left hand.-ECP.</page><page sequence="22">504 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.s., 36, 1934 including a lengthy burlesque of Pascolas or Deer dancers. During these fiestas they punish misbehavior. Yaqui moral functions are more pronounced. During Lent civil govern- ment is suspended and the clowns punish severely all crimes with particular emphasis on sexual irregularity. They also are in charge of the Christ image, normally in the care of the military society. During Lent all dead are buried by the clowns. Among the Yaqui relatives of persons dying during Lent are forced to give three annual mourn- ing feasts instead of the customary single anniversary observance. All members of the Yaqui clown society, no matter when they die, are buried by the clowns. For the "wake," corpses of members are dressed in full regalia, including one of the two masks preserved throughout the year. The mask is burned after burial of the corpse. These and other data suggest members remain Fariseos after death. In addition to the already mentioned functions in the Passion play of Holy week, Yaqui clowns, in conjunction with Pilate and his group, per- form a dance on several occasions. The final performance is on Easter Saturday when they advance gradually to a curtain before the altar. There Pilate demands to see the "tomb" of Christ. When the curtain is raised showing the image gone, the group rushes from the church, pelted with leaves and confetti by Pascolas and Deer dancers. After three repetitions, the masks and paraphernalia are burned. (The Mayo also make three flights from church but do not dance.) Both peoples subsequently re-bap- tize the clowns, choosing new godparents. After the services all gather in a circle near the door of the church and a speech is made (by their leader or the maestro?) and they thank one an- other. Mayo clowns give their godparents a bottle of mescal, pouring some upon the church floor. The Yaqui hold this ceremony after the fiesta finish on Sunday morning. Clowning Behavior by Dancers. The Pascolas dancers also indulge in clowning behavior of a different sort. Between periods of dancing they tell jokes and stories, often lewd. "How well you danced," a spectator may say. "Surely, that was because I slept with your wife last night," may be the reply. Individuals are addressed by relationship terms. Satirical comments are made on personal behavior and community affairs. Yaqui Pascolas dancers indulge in horseplay with the Deer dancer, imitating the dance, hunting the "deer," simulating sexual intercourse with each other or mas- turbation.29 This "play" is said to have been formerly performed by the Mayo also. 29 The clowning of the Yaqui Pascolas is especially like that of the Hopi Pi'ptiiyakyamti.</page><page sequence="23">PARSONS-BEALS] SACRED CLOWNS 505 Yaqui fiestas usually conclude, so far as dancing goes, with either the Badger Dance or the Deer Hunt. Each is an elaborate pantomime of hunting the animal of the dance with more or less stereotyped but informal dialogue with some obscenity. In both the "animal" is killed. At the beginning of each fiesta among both Yaqui and Mayo the prin- cipal Pascolas dancer is led into the dance place, masked and uttering shrill falsetto cries, "the cry of the Pascolas." An elaborate ritual includes a prayer to the animals of the woods, crosses made to the directions, speeches to each musician, and a formal prayer to the saint asking "per- mission for what we are going to do." At the conclusion the Saint's pardon is asked. General Remarks. The obscene behavior of both clowns and dancers is quite contrary to the ordinary conduct of life. Both Yaqui and Mayo are extremely modest, shy, and reticent concerning sex. They are not given to joking, the Mayo even less than the Yaqui. Clown behavior during cere- monies is not closely watched by adults. The dancers, on the other hand, have good audiences and their reputations hinge primarily on their abilities as jokesters. Appreciation is never boisterous, however. Police functions of the clowns are especially evident among the Yaqui. Everyone is forced to join in processions, participate in church services, etc., so that, strictly speaking, there are no real spectators. This is not true during begging trips and errands. Then the clown is at his best and gets most attention.30 The relation of Yaqui clowns to the soldier group of Pilate suggests a possible former war connection perhaps also expressed in the view that the wooden sticks are weapons. Against this is the lack of direct connection today with the regular war society. Of course all clowns are members of the war group-but so is practically every other man of the village. Clown obligations, moreover, supercede all others during Lent. A soldier may perform the soldier's dance: ten minutes later he may dance with the Matachines if he be a member of that group. This duality of function is denied the clown. During Lent a member is a clown and nothing else for the time being. It should be noted, too, that certain Hopi kachina will clown or "play" with clown groups. One kachina performs mock copulation with the townswomen who get the gifts he distributes. -ECP. 30 That the obscenity and clownishness are in part a vicarious outlet for a rather emotion- ally inhibited community is quite possible. This is especially evident with the dancers. The Pascolas may say and do, and the crowd may laugh at, things which are never said or done in everyday life. Ordinarily they would be not only offensive but grossly insulting.</page><page sequence="24">506 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.s., 36, 1934 The contemporary clown groups of the Yaqui and Mayo most prob- ably are a modified survival of an aboriginal institution which the mission- aries found easier to adapt than suppress. The record of the Jesuit missions in the region indicates a tendency towards assimilation of this sort. The aboriginal organization may have been quite similar. Membership was probably by dedication, trespass, or capture, and as the result of sickness. We may infer masks, rattle belts, cocoon rattles, and some sort of stick as parts of the costume. A vague war connection is to be suspected. Curing was almost certainly a primary function and by Pueblo analogies the group may have been associated with weather control, although this feature of Pueblo life almost certainly was little developed by the Yaqui-Mayo. Nothing in the present status of the clowns suggest weather control, but the horned water serpent is still a Yaqui-Mayo supernatural with close relations to the floods which are an essential but dangerous part of Cahita life.31 TABLE 2.

Among the Hopi the images of Water serpent may not be touched by young men lest they suffer disease, which suggests that Water serpent causes venereal disease in men.

In evidence are the association in New Mexico with the Matachina dance, the type of mask, the whip, and the association with Church fiestas. Probably Mexi- can colonists around San Juan32 introduced the beclowned Matachina which spread to Taos33 and to some of the southern pueblos. But even given this probability many other queries arise; queries about the provenience of the Chapaiyeka in Sonora, about their earliest relation- ship to the Pueblo clowns or rather clowning elements, and about the his- tory of the other clown types of the Pueblos. The Chapio or Grandfather clowns are associated with the Matachina in New Mexico-traits borrowed from the same source are readily com- bined; in Sonora the Chapaiyeka are seen on many of the same occasions as are the Matachina, but they are quite distinct, they do not "play" with the Matachina although they may burlesque them just as they burlesque the Deer dancer or the masked Pascola dancers. Now the Matachina dance we believe to be the same dance as is called La Conquista in Nayarit, Jalisco, and Oaxaca, perhaps elsewhere, in Yucatan, Xtoles,34 and in the Plateau, Los Moros, a European country dance introduced by the friars with vary- ing degrees of dramatization and with or without colloquies according to the degree of hispanicization of the peoples they were dealing with. In all these dances appear two clowns, variously called los Negros, los Negritos, los Diablos, los Viejos, los Mal Viejos, los Pilatos. They usually wear wood- en masks, with grotesque features or tusks, and usually painted black. They carry a whip with which they lay on, and frighten the children. They may carry a doll or a small stuffed animal with which they play various pranks. They gesture and do not speak. In the valley of Oaxaca35 the Negritos tease 32 In 1598, to celebrate the building of the church at San Juan, Ofiate presented a sham battle between Moors and Christians, i.e., Los Moros! (G. P. Hammond, Ofiate and the Founding of New Mexico, New Mexico Historical Review 1: 321, 1926). S3 As Matachina was formerly danced at Los Ranchos, an early Spanish-Indian pueblo five miles from Taos, Mexican colonists may have carried it there directly. u Starr, 11: 80-82. a The Mixe of eastern Oaxaca perform a burlesque of the masked Negrito dance given at some of their towns. The Negrito dance is a serious dance performed on the occasion of im- portant fiestas. The burlesquers are the Viejos, who elsewhere in Mexico would be known as Negritos, and men dressed as nearly as possible in the costume of city dwelling Mexican women. The Viejo is himself burlesqued by an unmasked clown with face blackened with charcoal. Still more significant is the custom at very primitive Mixistlan where, as part of a</page><page sequence="27">PARSONS-BEALS] SACRED CLOWNS 509 the women by rubbing their faces upward with a neckerchief none to clean. If a chair is to be fetched for a visiting sefiora, or a dancer needs something, the Negritos look after it. Like the dancers the Negritos function por promesa, for a vow, often made for sickness, usually for one year, sometimes longer. These clowns must be equated with the Chapaiyeka. But were they all Spanish and introduced along with the country dance or were they pre-Spanish figures combined with the dance and the church fiesta? The Aztecs used "ugly" or "frightful" masks in some of their ceremonial celebrations.36 The dance itself may have been based on a pre-Spanish dance, for Bernal Diaz writes that the Aztecs had a dance similar to the dance in Italy called Matachines,37 and the Chamuscado account in Obreg6n mentions that in Chihuahua the Indians danced an imitation of the Matachina ("imitan al baile de los Matachines," says the Spanish version) with what was apparently a leather rattle and pottery drum, by which he meant no doubt that their dance suggested the European country dance.38 From now on our conclusions or discussion we keep separate. Our general bias differs. One of us inclines to see in the Mexican and New Mexican clowns the devil-clown of the European medieval miracle play and religious folk dances, the fellow himself introduced by Spanish friars and devotees to Indian peoples sensitive to ridicule or being talked about and familiar with travesty or doing the opposite of the customary in order to feel brave and defiant in war or sexually stimulated or masterful in domestic or political life. The other of us inclines to discount the Spanish influence and believes that out and out clowning, buffoonery for amuse- ment, was a far-flung pre-Conquest Indian trait. (ECP Writing) The Matachina Grandfathers of San Juan (Pueblo) compared with those distinctly non-Christian ceremony for good harvests involving the sacrifice of dogs and chickens in the church, men dressed in burlesques of male and female Spanish costume dance jarabes before drinking liquor and leaving the church to attend the feast provided by the spon- sor of the ceremony. And at the other extreme of the area considered the mountain Nisenan of California burlesqued the sacred dances of their foothill neighbors. Burlesque is surely not confined to Europeans!-RLB. 38 Bernardino de Sahagun (Tr. by Fanny R.

If the other clown types of the Pueblos are derived from or have been affected by Spanish clowns the acculturation is much more profound, and of an earlier period. At one time I inclined to posit such early acculturation, deriving the bogey masks (and the Koyemshi) from the Spanish clown or devil or death masks.39 The theory is involved of course with that of the origin and development of the kachina mask, and latterly in view of the evidence I find in Sahagiin of the use of masks by the Aztecs in procession and dramatization in their mountain rain spirit cult, essentially a Kachina cult,40 I believe the theory of Spanish influence must be greatly modified. The western bogey kachina mask, Atoshle, Natashka, Chavaiyo, may well have been pre-Spanish and the Hopi term Chavaiyo4' extended to the clown impersonation derived from Sonora or Chihuahua42 or southern Arizona.43 Whether or not they 39 E.

For discussion of a possible relationship between Hopi bogey dramatization and the child sacrifice of the Aztecs, see Some Aztec and Pueblo Parallels, 616. Dr Bennett suggests that chape6n, the clown term among the Tarahuamara, and the related terms among the Pueblos are derived from the Spanish term cape6n, one who plays with the cape. "Los Capeos was a Spanish fiesta in which men used to take chances with the bull, without weapons." Note the bull masks among the Yaqui Chapaiyeka. In Spanish sources Dr Bennett has found the term Matachin applied to a masquerading group who used wooden swords and inflated bladders. 4 The Tarahuamara chape6nes show both Mayo-Yaqui and Pueblo clown traits. The chape6nes are in charge of the Matachine dancers who perform at church fiestas, valeting them, getting them out to dance, filling vacancies in the dance group. The chape6nes stand in line to one side of the Matachine dancers, marking time and at changes in the figures shouting in falsetto. The head chape6n wears a wooden mask, painted with white lines, with a white wig and beard. During the dancing he shifts the mask to the back of his head. Two chape6nes use inflated bull bladders. The head chape6n has a position of social distinction: he dedicates the liquor at the house of the fiesteros and he sits with the judges at law trials (W. C. Bennett, The Tarahuamara, ms.). 43 The occurrence of the Lententide Fariseo or "devil" among the Papago, together with the more formal type of clown who cures as well as entertains the people (see following paper by Dr Underhill), bears evidence to the Spanish character of the Fariseo of Mayo-Yaqui and Tarahuamare. Compare Fariseos of Tepoztln, Morelos (R. Redfield, Tepoztlan, University of Chicago Publications in Anthropology, 1930, p. 111, n.1). The Mescalero and Chiricahua Apache clown who entertains, cures, polices, and speaks for the other masked dancers (personal communication from Dr Opler) parallels in several ways the clown kachina of the western Pueblos.</page><page sequence="29">PARSONS-BEALS] SACRED CLOWNS 511 wore masks or merely animal pelts as at Taos, the mountain dwelling kid- napping cannibals were presumably pre-Spanish. As for the non-mask-wearing clowns of the Pueblos I suggest that many of their traits were those of the organized groups, weather-control or curing or war groups, particularly war groups, whence the clowns were drawn to enact the burlesques or farces that the Pueblos, like the Aztecs, Maya and Zapoteca44 (%nd presumably the Mayo-Yaqui and the people of Nayarit)45 considered part of ceremonial celebration. From war groups would come such traits as policing or managerial behavior, scouting, "making the road" or leading, foolhardy or perverse conduct like filth eating or gluttony, backward speech.46 Through functions in connection with scalp ceremonial, the enemy dead becoming rain makers, weather-control functions might be associated with clown groups, also rain rituals such as dousing with water or whipping against wind or cold or dancing for rain. The conception of contrary be- havior might lead to the idea that the clowns connected with curing societies were possessed also of black magic. Pueblo clown or near clown types are so varied that various sources 4 In the Aztec rain ceremony of every eight years there were impersonations of "poor people," wood carriers and peddlers, and sick persons (Sahagun, 146). These suggest the cast of the Hopi Pi'ptii comedies. At the "feast of merchants" in Cholula there were games and comedies in the courts of the temples in which many appeared lame, deaf, or blind; others as snails, toads, lizards, but- terflies and birds. Later they made a "mask or mummery with all these personages" (J. De Acosta. [Ed. by Clements R. Markham], The Natural and Moral History of the Indies, Publica- tions of the Hakluyt Society [London], 60-61: 387-88, 1880). Citing Landa, La Farge points out that comic dances were held in Yucatan before the Conquest, in the houses of those who wished to pay the dancers, as burlesque dances are per- formed today, by the Quich6 of Guatemala, burlesques of the Deer dance and the Cort6s dance (La Conquista or Matachina) during Carnival. The Mayan term for burlesque means old, referring here to the old clothes or rags that are worn (0. La Farge and D. Byers, The Year Bearer's People, Middle American Research Series, Publ. No. 3. Tulane University of Louisiana, 1931, pp. 109-110). A burlesque of La Conquista is performed by the Mal Viejos, the Bad Old Men, in the Zapoteca town of Zaachila, at Carnival, and in other Zapoteca towns. At this season the Mal Viejos make domiciliary begging trips. The independent burlesque of the priests at Zaacalia is even-more complete than such a burlesque would be among the Pueblos. Possibly Indian and Spaniard converged in their sense of burlesque and Indian notions fitted readily into the Spanish Carnival. 4 Clowning behavior is described at Tepic, in 1580 (Alonso Ponce, Relacion, etc., in Colecci6n de documentos ineditos para la historia de la Espafia, vols. 12-13 [Madrid], 13: 76). 46 See some of the Plains war societies. We should not overlook the fact that fully de- veloped clown traits are found among Plains tribes independently of war societies (Spanish Elements in the Kachina Cult of the Pueblos, 596, n.53).</page><page sequence="30">512 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.s., 36, 1934 and processes of development must be considered. Mexican clowns on the other hand are more or less alike, and it seems strange that there should be so much similarity in the Spanish-Indian clown complex unless that complex was carried by the Spaniards. On the other hand more knowledge of both contemporary and ancient Mexican peoples may show an unexpect- ed degree of cultural homogeneity in the pre-Spanish period. Burlesque, impersonation of supernaturals, rites of all kinds, political arxd ceremonial organization, may appear parts of a cultural system so submerged that as yet we have seen but a few of its peaks among scattering conservative peoples. (RLB Writing) If I were to modify the joint statement of conclusions in any important particular it would be to say that the Negritos or Mal Viejos of the Mexican Conquista dance are not to be equated directly to the Chapaiyeka or Sonoran clown: rather certain elements of their behavior are to be equated with the facets of Cahita (and Pueblo) clown behavior. Other aspects, particularly their masks and falsetto call, resemble those of the Cahita Pascolas dancer. Probably some of these traits, or at least their present forms and associations, are due to Spanish influence. On the other hand, Dr Julian Steward's analysis of the clown in North America (in ms.) makes it evident that clowning was a widely spread complex in most of North America which, while it had many varying associations in different areas, carried with it a number of relatively uniform behavioristic and functional traits. When all Dr Steward's evidence is available, I believe it will be plain that many of the behavior traits and functions of even the clowns associated with the Mexican Conquista and Moros dances have a distribution far beyond the areas of Spanish influence and in associations making it reason- ably certain they represent part of the original American clowning com- plex.47 As a theoretical position I prefer Dr Parsons' second alternative, that the basic similarities of Mexican clowns are in large part elements from a general cultural system once widely diffused throughout Mexico. The presence of this cultural stratum has to some extent been obscured: first, by our lack of knowledge of northern Mexico; secondly, by its peculiar distribution owing to the non-agricultural or but partially agricultural peoples which at the time of the conquest and before formed a more or 4 See also Julian H.

As has been pointed out, Yaqui-Mayo clowns are not specifically associated with the Cahita Matachin dances. Clearly the Abuelo or grand- father mask type of clown, a relatively unimportant Yaqui type, and the Matachine dance reached the Cahita separately and do not explain all inter-areal similarities. It might be argued that those similarities which are not traceable to the Matachin association are also due to Spanish influence. However, they may equally well be similarities established in pre-Caucasian times. This latter view is strengthened by the presence of other striking similarities in the field of non-material culture. An example is the occurrence of sand- paintings which, despite the inadequacy of the early missionary account, have their every feature duplicated at some point among the Pueblos. Of unquestionable significance to historical deductions is also the fact that these resemblances are not established for any one Pueblo group: rather they are to be found, like many of the clown similarities, one feature in one group, one in another. Because of the functional integration and importance of the organiza- tional aspects of Cahita clowns we have assumed that in general if there has been borrowing it has been from Cahita to Pueblos rather than the reverse. But to assume that the clowns were an indigenous development of the Cahita-speaking peoples would controvert the general lack of original- ity in Cahita culture.49 This type of argument is very unsatisfactory but it poses the possibility that the similarities of Pueblo and Cahita clowns are of a generalized type which were derived by both peoples from some third source as yet unknown. We come again to the hypothetical general- ized Mexican culture of which the two groups under consideration repre- sent specialized adaptations.50 48 This situation is revealed and the outline of the general cultural stratum suggested in R. L. Beals, Comparative Ethnology of Northern Mexico (Ibero-Americana 2, 1932). 49 The general account of the Cahita will give further material on this subject when it is finally published. Although complex and rather rich on the non-material side, Cahita culture contains very little not to be found in more developed form among neighboring peoples. Much of its complexity seems due to the fact the culture exhibits derivations from both north and south which have here fused. o0 A few suggestive data may be mentioned in this regard. At Cuynacaro, Jalisco, at the time of the Conquest some of the Indians wore "many straws before the face in the manner</page><page sequence="32">514 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.S., 36, 1934 To carry this hypothesis one step further, it seems likely that it was from this generalized cultural stratum that the Spanish influenced Mata- chin and associated dances, whose Indian precursors have been suggested, and the attendant clowns, derived their evidently deep-rooted hold on the Indian. Likewise it was on this widespread basis the dances gained their extensive distribution, either as a making over of existing traits which had diffused previously or as a closely analogous substitute. Among the Cahita and Pueblos, however, we find surviving evidence of the pre-Caucasian traits themselves.

(See Joaquin Garcia Icazbalceta, Collecci6n de Documentos para la Historia de Mexico [Mexico], 2 v., 1858-1866, 2: 440.) In Tepic masked individuals performed clowning actions according to Ponce, who visited there in 1580 (Alonso Ponce, Relacion breve y verdadera de algunas cosas, etc., in Collecci6n de documentos ineditos para la historia de la Espafia, vols. 12-13 [Madrid], 13: 76.
