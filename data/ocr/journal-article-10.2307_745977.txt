Reviewed by Fred Everett Maus Robert P. Morgan's selection of essays by Edward T. Cone is valuable partly because it draws attention to excel- lent writings that admirers of Cone's work may not have encountered. Probably few theorists have been regular read- ers of The Georgia Review or The Musical Newsletter; two of Cone's best essays, "Three Ways of Reading a Detective Story-or a Brahms Intermezzo," and "Inside the Saint's Head: The Music of Berlioz," first appeared in those peri- odicals, and their inclusion in Music: A View from Delft will undoubtedly enlarge their audience. But more generally, by bringing together essays on many topics, written at many different times, Morgan's collection invites readers to consider the continuity and diversity of Cone's thought, and perhaps to attempt a unified image of what Morgan calls Cone's "remarkably individual, and un- mistakably creative, voice" (p. ix). Cone's previous books, Musical Form and Musical Performance and The Composer's Voice, each address a specific topic (though in each case Cone construes the topic broadly).' Not surprisingly, aspects of Cone's work that are not represented in the earlier books emerge clearly from the new collection; these essays also supplement and, in some cases, modify the claims of the book-length studies. 'Musical Form and Musical Performance (New York: W. W. Norton, 1968): The Composer's Voice (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1974). Each derives from a series of lectures. The collection covers Cone's entire career as a writer.2 The earliest of the essays, a study of Verdi's late operas, dates from 1954; the most recent is a general essay on the medium of opera, first published in this volume. The essays cover a wide range of subject matter-pitch structure in Schoenberg's songs, temporal structure in music by Stravin- sky, text-setting in song and opera, methods of creating and resolving suspense in music and fiction, the tasks of various kinds of music critic, and so on. Morgan anticipates that readers may disagree with his choice of essays: "Those familiar with Cone's work will no doubt be disappointed to find some of their favorite essays missing" (p. viii). In my case, Morgan is right. I think the collection should have included "Schubert's Promissory Note: An Essay in Musical Hermeneutics."3 An important, provocative study, bearing on issues of musical narrative or drama, "Schubert's Promissory Note" will certainly remain one of Cone's most influential essays, and it should be avail- able in the context of Cone's other writings. (Curiously, Mor- gan does include a conceptually less ambitious companion essay, "Schubert's Unfinished Business.") But this is a minor reservation. The important point is that this fine collection will make it easier to think about and respond to many of Cone's best essays, and will encourage musical scholars to consider these essays in relation to each other. Readers of Musical Form and Musical Performance are aware of Cone's concern for the rhythmic and temporal as- pects of musical unity. Several essays in Music: A View from 'It certainly does not collect all of his essays. Cone has been an ex- traordinarily prolific writer. Music: A View from Delft includes a helpful bibliography of Cone's writings (it takes up about three pages of rather small type).

Cone conceives rhythmic issues primarily in terms of motion toward goals, or, as he puts it in "Analysis Today," in tel- eological terms (p. 42). "Analysis Today" explores Cone's well-known concept of the "structural downbeat," a goal of preparatory motion; many of the examples are from twentieth-century music. Similar concepts permit him an apt description of Berlioz's structures (p. 223): His elastic sense of phrase works hand in hand with his highly developed aptitude for sustaining long lines in order to create a special type of large-scale construction, conceived less as the de- velopment of one or more motivic or thematic ideas than as a wave-like series of motions toward a succession of proximate goals, each of which in turn initiates a further motion-and so on, until the final goal is reached. As an intriguing elaboration of this concern with goals and continuity, Cone offers several analyses that center on non- consecutive continuations-forms of continuity across gaps. His account of such patterns in music by Stravinsky, espe- cially the Symphonies of Wind Instruments, is well known. He finds similar structures-"long-range projects" that "in- evitably involve what seem to be interruptions of the prin- cipal musical line or interpolations within it" (p. 151)-in music of Berlioz; for instance, the separate entries of the brass choirs in the Requiem, taken together, constitute a coherent progression. And an essay is devoted to various "commitments to the future" in Schubert's music, passages that eventually lead to a "long-postponed fulfillment" (p. 201).4 Though Cone often describes teleological structures, his sensitivity to the issue also allows him to characterize a contrasting sense of time in Stravinsky's Symphony in C, 4Curiously, Cone introduces the notion of teleological structure, in "Analysis Today," with a brief example of such an interrupted succession in Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E Major, Op. 109 (p. 42). where "Stravinsky's sections-rhythmically persistent, har- monically static, melodically circular" (p. 288) provide ap- propriate material for a structure that manipulates propor- tional relations among large sections. The title essay, also the first essay in the book, articulates a more general conception of artistic unity. "Music: A View from Delft" begins by narrating the development of Cone's relation to a particular work of art-a painting, rather than a composition. Cone reports that he was fascinated and puz- zled by his response to Vermeer's "A View of Delft"- puzzled because he "was unable to account for my reaction to this apparently objective, realistically detailed represen- tation that, without obvious sentimental or personal asso- ciations, was nevertheless deeply moving" (p. 13). In re- flecting on the painting, Cone, as he tells it, eventually realized that the Vermeer "embraces the complexities of the scene and relates them in an all-pervading unity. The artistic value of the representation is the result of the tension be- tween these two poles . . . the tension between the two has been brought into balance by the vision of the artist" (p. 14). More generally, there are "numerous possible tensions" in art, and "the artist's job is to create a perceptible unity out of the complexity resulting from just this multiplicity of ten- sions" (p. 14). Developing the point, he notes that the two elements that create such tension-the "polar couple"- should be "satisfied together organically, so that each mem- ber of the pair grows out of the other." The elements that create tension must be "fused by mutual analogy," and the work must be "saturated" with such elements (pp. 14-15). The procedure of starting from a concrete example is characteristic of Cone's work. Some of his best writing ad- dresses particular works in detailed, insightful analysis, while sustaining a sense that larger theoretical issues are contin- uously, if sometimes implicitly, under discussion. (This effect is especially pronounced in The Composer's Voice.) How-</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 101 ever, the account of the Vermeer painting is brief and vague, and Cone moves remarkably quickly to his broad general- izations about tension in art. The book contains no repro- duction of the painting, and probably few readers feel any need to consult a reproduction. For once, Cone's habit of working between concrete instances and generalities does not lead to the fusion that he seeks.5 Cone continues by applying these concepts to music, re- maining at a highly abstract level. The essay moves rapidly through many genres and, fleetingly, mentions a number of compositions. Cone depends heavily on his special vocab- ulary of fusion, mutual analogy, and saturation: "Beethov- en's Diabelli Variations is a triumphant example of a com- pletely saturated form arising from an unpromising hypothesis" (p. 16); "The successful song . . . is one more example of the principle of analogical fusion" (p. 20); "It is not simply the combination of elements that gives opera its peculiar fascination; it is the fusion produced by the mutual analogy of words and music" (p. 21). Since the essay depends heavily on these terms, it is noteworthy that they are rare elsewhere in the collection. On the other hand, the con- ception of a unity that incorporates and balances tension is one of Cone's guiding principles, and other essays give ex- tended applications. The idea appears already in the early essay "The Old Man's Toys: Verdi's Last Operas" (p. 167): -For a splendid account of Vermeer's paintings, see Lawrence Gowing, Vermeer (New York: Harper and Row, 1970). Gowing treats Vermeer's paintings as a sustained reflection on the distance between a painting and what it depicts, and as a rejection of the fantasy of painterly domination of the represented subject. The "View of Delft," he writes, "presents us with our most memorable image of the remoteness which is the essence of Ver- meer's world. In the reflecting expanse of this canal we look upon the very symbol of that cool zone, penetrable only by the light, which separates the artist from the matter of life" (p. 129). This beautiful description brings out qualities of the painting that are quite different from those Cone describes. It is Verdi's achievement of emphatic moment without sacrifice of temporal span which today attracts the attention of those composers for whom sheer sound is not enough . . . The colorful detail must take its place in the complete musical phrase, and the phrase must contribute to the unfolding of the complete line. "Stravinsky: The Progress of a Method" identifies the technique of "stratification," which "sets up a tension be- tween successive time segments," and specifies that this ten- sion must be resolved: "Some sort of unification is the nec- essary goal toward which the entire composition points, for without it there is no cogency in the association of the com- ponent areas" (p. 295). After commenting on several pas- sages by Sessions, Cone writes that "In every case one finds that the detail vitalizes the progression, the progression im- parts significance to the whole" (p. 314). In the Classical period, the "constant interplay of meter and rhythm" con- stitutes a "tension between the abstract and the concrete," and contributes greatly to the "vitality" of the music (p. 49). So much concern with unity may seem untimely. In a recent survey of opinions about "The Future of Theory," one can find Nicholas Cook complaining about "the fixation on musical unity," and Jonathan Kramer predicting that "music theory will depose from its position of false universality the obsessive quest for unity."6 But perhaps Cone's conceptions of unity, emphasizing temporality, tension, and conflict, are livelier than the approaches that Cook and Kramer have in mind. That is, objections to the "obsessive quest for unity" may concern particular conceptions of unity (for instance, conceptions that govern academic Schenkerian, motivic, se- rial, or set-theoretical analysis), and Cone's discussions may remain pertinent in that they can offer alternatives to familiar 6"The Future of Theory," Indiana Theory Review 10 (1989). 72, 86.</page><page sequence="4">102 Music Theory Spectrum conceptions of unity.7 It is also possible, of course, that one can benefit from Cone's identification of various tensions among elements of music without insisting that analysis dis- cover a final resolution or balance in every case. Cone is not known only, or primarily, as a theorist of unity. On the back cover of Music: A View from Delft, one reads that Cone's work can be called 'humane formalism" (Joseph Kerman), and that his work "stands out as inhabiting an almost no-man's land of broad and humane studies of music" (Leo Treitler). Robert Morgan's Preface observes that Cone's "readings of individual compositions . . possess 7Cone's general approach, with its attention to the integration of con- flicting elements, may strike scholars in other disciplines as familiar, even to the point of banality. For instance, there are analogues for Cone's position in literary criticism, particularly New Criticism. Cleanth Brooks, after stating that he is concerned with structure in poetry, attempts to specify the relevant notion of structure: "The structure meant is a structure of meanings, eval- uations, and interpretations: and the principle of unity which informs it seems to be one of balancing and harmonizing connotations, attitudes, and mean- ings . . . the principle is not one which involves the arrangement of the various elements into homogeneous groupings, pairing like with like. It unites the like with the unlike. It does not unite them, however, by the simple process of allowing one connotation to cancel out another nor does it reduce the contradictory attitudes to harmony by a process of subtraction. The unity is not a unity of the sort to be achieved by the reduction and simplification appropriate to an algebraic formula. It is a positive unity, not a negative: it represents not a residue but an achieved harmony" (Tle Well Wrolught Urn [San Diego: Harcourt Brace Johanovich. 1947], p. 195.) One could appropriately summarize Cone's claims as an insistence on the "balance" that comes from "uniting the like with the unlike," leading to "an achieved harmony," and Cone's value of "saturation" can stand as a positive alter- native to the unity that comes from "reduction and simplification." But, whatever may be true of other disciplines, it cannot be said that musical analysis has fully explored tensions and conflicting tendencies in music. (However, an interesting example of such an emphasis can be found in Arnold Schoenberg. Fndamentalr s of lMusical Composition [London: Faber and Faber. 1967]. which treats musical structure as a compromise between conflicting tendencies toward contrast and repetition.) a humanistic dimension all too rare in recent musical dis- course" (p. vii). There are various aspects of Cone's writing that invite these descriptions-his willingness to write about music in the context of other arts, his style of persuasive commentary rather than belligerent argument, and his ex- plicit, articulate praise for the music he admires. But Music: A View from Delft clarifies another "human- istic" aspect of Cone's work, one that emerges more clearly here than in his other books. Of the 18 essays in the col- lection, ten either characterize important features of a single composer's music or interpret individual compositions in ways that bear on other pieces by the same composer. (The other essays are mostly general studies of issues in aesthetics, criticism, or analysis.) Much of Cone's work consists of a kind of portraiture. It is as though, in certain of his essays, the basic object of critical thought is not the individual piece, not the style or repertory, but the composer. The portraits do not depict the actual writers of the music, in all their biographical contingency, but rather the composers as they emerge from the music itself.8 Cone's evocation of an image of the composer is most comprehensive in the two essays on Berlioz, but the book also presents intriguing, if partial, images of Schubert, Verdi, Schoenberg, Webern, Stravinsky, and Sessions. And the es- say on Beethoven's late Bagatelles, though not aspiring to generalities about Beethoven, places those pieces in the con- text of more ambitious compositions (as "experiments"). The ability to conjure up a personality-a human but pri- marily musical personality-from a group of compositions, a concatenation of notes, can seem almost magical. One SAlexander Nehamus presents a sophisticated and pertinent account of the notion of an "author"-a figure constructed from a group of literary works-in "Writer, Text, Work, Author," in Literature and the Question of Philosophy, ed. A. J. Cascadi (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 1987). 267-291.</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 103 name for the magic might be prosopopoeia. Prosopopoeia is, specifically, the trope of attributing a face or voice to an absent or inanimate entity; more generally, it is personifi- cation or animation. Prosopopoeia is one of the dominant devices of Cone's writing, not only in his portraiture, but in his claims about the "persona" and "agents" of music, even in the implicit anthropomorphism of his teleological ap- proach.9 The essay "In Defense of Song: The Contribution of Roger Sessions" gives especially fascinating, complex evi- dence of the workings of prosopopoeia. Early in the essay, Cone states that "Sessions the man and Sessions the musician are indistinguishable" (p. 305). This is, of course, a report, by someone who knew and studied with Sessions, of the continuity between Sessions's qualities as a composer and Sessions's character in other contexts. But the sentence can also be read as a specification of the particular meaning of "Sessions" in the essay: the essay is primarily about the Sessions that can be elicited from the music, and other facts about Sessions are mostly not pertinent. The elision of the person and the music takes a startling turn when Cone introduces a play on words: "His compo- sitions, which have often been praised for their 'long line,' take their place in what he calls the 'great line of Western tradition' " (p. 306). Somehow, Sessions's role in musical history is being conflated with the continuity of his individual works, as though the composer were being identified with the music. Amazingly, Cone continues the conflation. He cites Sessions's own view of the predicament of a composer in the 9I have discussed prosopopoeia with particular attention to The Com- poser's Voice in "Agency in Instrumental Music and Song," College Music Symposium 29 (1989), 31-43. The essay is part of a set devoted to The Composer's Voice. J. Hillis Miller, Versions of Pygmalion (Cambridge: Har- vard University Press, 1990) is a fine study of prosopopoeia, combining theoretical material and careful readings of several works of fiction. early twentieth century, when "the constantly increasing re- finement of detail, the increasingly static quality of musical language" had led to an impasse (p. 308). I Cone then cites several passages in Sessions's compositions where the music seems to reach a point of stasis, as if stuck on a particular harmony, but then overcomes the resistance to forward mo- tion: "The propulsive power of the line defeats the temp- tation to overemphasize the detail" (p. 312). The music seems to replicate the development of music history up to and beyond the beginning of Sessions's career. After this extended troping between Sessions's position in history and the continuity of his music, Cone apparently changes the subject, elaborating Sessions's notion of "song" as a clarification of musical "line." As Cone writes, "In a word-Sessions's word-the composer must sing . . . the composer's conviction that music is essentially song has in- formed his work during all periods of activity" (p. 317). The discussion of song can be regarded, not as a change of sub- ject, but as the culmination of Cone's elision of composer and composition. To regard instrumental music as song is to give it a voice (the composer's voice, perhaps), supplying it with a full human presence. After moving explicitly between observations about Sessions and observations about his mu- sic, Cone now moves to a fully humanized musical object, as though the music is finally independent of, while somehow embodying, the historical person who wrote it. Prosopopoeia is a fragile form of language. It humanizes, but at the cost of displaying the artifice of the humanization. In the essay on Sessions, the artifice is apparent in Cone's troping between Sessions and Sessions's compositions: one doesn't know whether to admire the revelation of the man "'Sessions's view of the situation. which Cone quotes without dissent, resembles positions that Leo Treitler has criticized aptly in "The Present as History." in Music and the Historical Imagination (Cambridge: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1989), 95-156.</page><page sequence="6">104 Music Theory Spectrum in the music or Cone's ingenuity and boldness as a writer. The artifice is also apparent in Cone's overly persistent evo- cation of song, a concept that rarely appears elsewhere in the collection and, thus, cannot be as fundamental as this essay suggests. 11 The title of the essay "Music: A View from Delft" fore- casts its troping between visual art and music, but also im- plies a subtler relation to Vermeer's "View of Delft." The title alters the name of the painting. What the title promises is, so to speak, a view of music as seen from Delft: the implication is not just that visual art and music share some general aesthetic principles, but also that Cone might occupy Vermeer's position, grasping the "bewildering multiplicity" of the arts in a single coherent view while retaining the rich- ness of differentiated detail. The painting serves as both an instance of artistic success and a model for the comprehen- sive perspective of successful criticism. "Music: A View from Delft" is an essay about the unity of works of art and about the unity of the critic's view of art. By entitling this volume Music: A View from Delft, Mor- gan and Cone imply that the collection as a whole is unified by the coherent vision of its author. Morgan's Preface em- phasizes the unity of Cone's thought: "All the articles in- cluded are reflections of a single, integral conception of mu- sic" (p. ix). Relatedly, Morgan sustains Cone's language of visual perception: "Cone has viewed the field from an un- "Similarly. in "Stravinsky: The Progress of a Method." Cone argues against the claim that Stravinsky has "embraced a series of manners" rather than "achieving a personal style." To argue for the continuity of Stravinsky's development, he offers an analysis of "the apparent discontinuities that so often interrupt the musical flow" (p. 293). Again, the essay transfers qualities between the musician and the music, and it is hard to know whether one is perceiving the integrity of Stravinsky's career or the clever integration of Cone's essay. usually comprehensive perspective" (p. vii). Perhaps, then, a reader should aspire to sharing this integral perspective. But Cone's Introduction, unlike Morgan's Preface, sug- gests a somewhat different emphasis. There, Cone mentions the "inconsistencies and even outright contradictions" that appear among the essays (and he states: "I am not ashamed"). This remark suggests that while one will note the recurring patterns of Cone's thought, it is also valuable to develop a sense of the distinctness of these essays. In some cases, the differences among the essays reflect changes in Cone's beliefs on various issues-something that one would expect in a set of essays written over some 35 years. But there is another, more interesting way that the essays diverge. I noted that some of Cone's terms-the physical meta- phors of "fusion" and "saturation," the implied prosopo- poeia of "song"-are confined to individual essays. In fact, Cone often develops a small set of privileged terms within an individual essay; the essay makes extensive use of its distinctive vocabulary, testing it in a variety of contexts, but then the special terms do not reappear, or do not receive comparable emphasis, in other writings. "Three Ways of Reading a Detective Story" develops an account of "first, second, and third readings." "The Authority of Music Crit- icism" relies heavily on a distinction between "conception" and "perception." That essay also draws extensively on re- ligious discourse, using the term "faith" repeatedly, and clos- ing with this account of the critic's task: "The critic succeeds, not by uncovering eternal truths about a work, but by helping his readers establish closer contact with it. If the music stands in ultimate judgment over him, great art stands in judgment over us all" (p. 112). "Beyond Analysis," in contrast, seems to trope on the existentialist and prescriptivist ethical the- ories that were current in the 1960s, theories that dramatize a contrast between factual knowledge and evaluative deci-</page><page sequence="7">Reviews 105 sions.'2 In "Stravinsky: The Progress of a Method," one learns about "stratification, interlock, and synthesis" (p. 294). "Sound and Syntax: An Introduction to Schoenberg's Harmony" identifies a variety of "normals" that govern Schoenberg's pitch structures.13 Perhaps, then, the unity of a single coherent perspective does not provide the best model for some aspects of this set of essays. One might turn, instead, to "Inside the Saint's Head: The Music of Berlioz," where Cone describes Ber- lioz's music as "a music of multiple perspective . . . of shift- ing points of view shown in succession" (p. 237). Or, doing without the visual analogies, one could characterize Cone's work as, in part, the vigorous exploration of a wide range of alternative vocabularies for describing music, some of them metaphorical. In this aspect of his work, then, Cone is anti-systematic. These divergent vocabularies give his work an aspect of "be- wildering multiplicity," perhaps sufficient to defuse any im- pression of an "all-pervading unity" in his writings. These last remarks are not meant as an objection to Cone's writ- ings. On the contrary: his willingness to explore alternative ''Iris Murdoch, in an excellent critical discussion of this philosophy, writes vividly that it depicts "the fearful solitude of the individual marooned upon a tiny island in the middle of a sea of scientific facts, and morality escaping from science only by a wild leap of the will" (The Sovereignty of Good [London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. 1970], 27). 3Not only are these vocabularies mostly confined to single essays. but also, within those essays. they typically begin to show a bit of strain, as though the essay really does "use up" its most distinctive terms. vocabularies may be one of the most valuable and prophetic aspects of his writing. Such explorations show an attractively pragmatic approach to music criticism, a sense of theoretical or analytical terms as tools that should be used as long as they are helpful, abandoned when other tools seem better. The several common features and points of divergence among the essays in Music: A View from Delft are much easier to notice now that the essays have been collected. Over the next few years, musicians will make many discov- eries about Cone's thought, and about music, by pondering this volume. I should not end without mentioning another unifying aspect of Cone's work, perhaps the one that is most frequently admired: his graceful, direct style, which makes the essays a pleasure to read. And, of course, the rather conceptually oriented observations that I have made are worth making only because these essays are distinguished, again and again, by Cone's musicality-his ability to draw attention to salient qualities of the music he discusses. Cone's general study of Berlioz, "Inside the Saint's Head," which offers a series of superb observations about many aspects of Berlioz's style, deserves to be singled out as a particularly concentrated and sustained example of this musicality.14 14Cone has discussed Berlioz in various contexts. always insightfully. Taken as a whole, his work on Berlioz-the two essays in this collection, the fine Critical Edition of the Fantastic Symphony (New York: W. W. Norton, 1971), and the chapter "A Lesson from Berlioz" in The Composer's Voice (pp. 81-114)-constitutes his most impressive achievement as a critic, not least because of the diversity of approach that these writings represent.</page></plain_text>
