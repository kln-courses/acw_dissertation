<plain_text><page sequence="1">To a Fellow Professor or Two Don't you feel, sometimes, As you stand there Pontificating prophet-like with your feet planted firmly On the tenured center of the universe, And with your unused hands clenched possessively Upon the purple pulpit whose roots are fixed firmly In the very core of essence- Don't you feel, sometimes, Like Christ himself Standing on the barren bleached shores among the multi- tude As you split a loaf or two of the staff of life Called knowledge- (Though you dispense both chaff and grain For them to winnow)- Toward those hungry, silent faces Behind the upturned palms of eyes and ears and minds, And motionless lips murmuring, "I accept your tiny crumbs."- Don't you feel, sometimes, Like Christ himself Standing on the barren bleached shores among the multitude As you divide the small remains of some single tiny fish Called critic, (Or perhaps split a tiny hare or two from your own per- sonal hutch) Into a feast For those hungry, silent faces Behind the upturned palms of eyes and ears and minds, And motionless lips murmuring, "I accept your tiny piece of fishbone; I accept your tiny square of hairshirt."- Don't you feel, sometimes, As you stand there At that very private anthropomorphic center of the uni- verse, At the very vortex of that intellectual sea of life From whence your stentorian tones Move outward into ever-growing pie-wedged ripples Of baptismal waters, Surging forward to inundate and to wash clean Those hungry, silent faces (Filthy with the grime of nonknowledge) Behind the upturned palms of eyes and ears and minds, And motionless lips murmuring. "I accept your cleansing action."- Tell me, now, in strictest confidence, Dear colleague. Tell me, now, please do. Don't you feel, sometimes: MY GOD! HOW GREAT IT IS TO MAKE WAVES!
