<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dushan Bednarsky Blood and Tears, Love and Death: Seventeenth-Century Devotional Homoeroticism and Tuptalo's "Verses on the Lord's Passion"* The "Verses on the Lord's Passion" by Dmytro Tuptalo (St. Dimitrii, Metropolitan of Rostov, 1651-1709) is a little-known masterpiece of Early Modern Ukrainian poetry. A bibliographic rarity, the "Verses" present the twentieth-century reader with an extravagantly sensuous expression of a poet's desire for the body of Jesus. They celebrate the humanity of the incarnate God, and explore the possibilities offered by the flesh of Christ. Tuptalo's desire for carnal and spiritual communion with God is couched in a Ukrainian Orthodox version of devotio moderna - an early modern spiritual exercise involving meditation on Jesus' sufferings as a means of spiritual edification. The "Verses" marshal libidinal sexuality, and reveal a seventeenth-century Ukrainian poet's ability to harmoniously conjoin the world of the flesh with that of the soul. Tuptalo is a preeminent figure in East Slavic, and especially Ukrainian, literature. His enormous talent was recognized in his own lifetime throughout the Orthodox Slavic world. After his death, his work was read by leading Ukrainian authors - including Taras Shevchenko.1 Tuptalo's literary productivity was massive: his magnum opus Reading Menaion (Chet'i-Minei - Lives of the Saints for daily reading), his Bedewed Fleece (Runo oroshennoe), his Apologia, and his Deliberations on the Image and Likeness of God in the Human Being (Rassuzhdenie o obrazi bozhii i podobii ν chelovitsï) were printed and reprinted in his own lifetime and continued to be republished in the three centuries following his death.2 His polemic against the Old Believers, Rozysk ο raskolnycheskoi brynskoi viri (Examination of the Schismatic Brynian Sect) and his historical chronicle (Litopys) circulated in manuscript form in his lifetime, and were published posthumously in numerous editions throughout the eighteenth century. During the course of the nineteenth and the early twentieth * This paper was first presented at the Canadian Association of Slavists' Conference in Calgary, June 9-11, 1994.

This article will focus only on his "Verses on the Lord's Passion." It is argued here that the carnal, libidinal quality of Tuptalo' s passion imagery deserves the attention of scholars. It seems that Tuptalo' s use of erotic imagery, far from being accidental, has a solid theological foundation. The text celebrates the incarnation of God, and expresses the author's desire for carnal and spiritual communion with God's Son - a loving, intimate relationship that is personal and mutually responsive. The eroticization of the human being's relationship with the sacred is common to many religions. In Christianity the prayer life of mystical writers, often women, has frequently drawn on the sexual libido's potential to bring the devotee into an intimate communion with the divine.3 Marilyn May Mallory, in her study of Juan de la Cruz, points out that the sexualization of the Christian mystic's relationship to a masculine God is nothing new, but rather, follows in the footsteps of women mystics who have been doing so for centuries. But according to Mallory, we need to challenge women's exclusive dominion over this theme.4 Men, too, have a libidinal need for the erotic dimension of prayer that such symbolism opens up. Mallory concludes that, "it is men who are short-changed, at least those who are not homosexual. They have great difficulty in establishing the affective motivation which would serve as the basis for a rich, libidinal approach to God."5 Contemporary scholars of Renaissance literature, particularly Richard Rambuss, have recently argued that, throughout Christian history, male 3 See José Maria Poveda Arino, La psicologia de Santa Teresa de Jesus (Madrid, 1984). Robert T. Petersson, in The Art of Ecstasy: Teresa, Bernini, and Crashaw (New York, 1974) does a comparative study in which St. Teresa's Vida, Bernini's Cornaro Chapel in Rome, and Richard Crashaw' s poem "A Hymn to the Name and Honour of the Admirable Saint Teresa" are discussed against a common theme of carnal and spiritual ecstasy. 4 Marilyn May Mallory, Christian Mysticism: Transcending Techniques (Amsterdam, 1977) 173. Mallory' s research is particularly interesting because it approaches the subject from the perspective of a psychologist. D Mallory, Christian Mysticism 172-173. Mallory avoids dealing with the obviously homoerotic aspects of Juan de la Cruz's desire for God's Son. At first she argues for the feminization of Jesus as the Divine Spouse in Juan's devotional writings. As her book progresses, however, she then proceeds to desexualize the relationship altogether. Although Mallory raises the homosexual possibility, she avoids dealing with the obviously homoerotic aspects of Juan de la Cruz's poems of desire for the Son of God. Instead, she substitutes the feminine Sophia (God's Wisdom), rather than the masculine Christ, for the object of Juan de la Cruz's mystical union.</page><page sequence="3">TUPTALO' S "VERSES ON THE LORD' S PASSION" 63 believers indeed have been eroticizing their relationship with Jesus.6 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick explores the paradoxical attitude of Christianity toward sexuality: although Christianity fears and prohibits sexual - especially homosexual - desire, it nevertheless features at its core an iconic display of Jesus as an unclothed or unclothable male, in a state of ecstasy, prescriptively meant to be gazed at and adored.7 Rambuss proposes that erotic desire for a male body - the body of Jesus - occupies a privileged position in the religious art and poetry of the seventeenth century. In his study of the body of Jesus and the Renaissance religious lyric, Rambuss argues that the canonical religious poetry of the seventeenth-century - devoutly fixated on the incarnation of its deity as fully human and indicatively male - is fundamentally homoerotic in ways that prevailing criticism has refused to acknowledge or has obscured.9 E.K. Sedgwick poses the question "What does it mean - what difference does it make - when a social or political relationship is sexualized?" She explores the ways in which the shapes of sexuality and what counts as sexuality depend on and affect historical power relationships. Similarly, a question can be asked, namely, "What happens to a spiritual relationship between a male religious believer and the masculine God that he worships - when this relationship is sexualized?" To explore the erotic possibilities of seventeenth-century Ukrainian Orthodox prayer life, it is necessary to situate Tuptalo's "Verses on the Lord's Passion" within the larger context of Early Modern sexuality and religious devotion. Challenged by Sedgwick' s deliberation - "if the relation of homosocial to homosexual bonds is so shifty, then what theoretical framework do we have for drawing any links between sexual and power relationships?" - an attempt is made here to apply a theoretical framework linking same-sex desire with Early Modern Ukrainian Orthodox devotional life. When considering the case of Dmytro Tuptalo, we need to acknowledge a crucial difference between Early Modern European society and our own. During the seventeenth-century emotional loyalties were far more important than they are today. Twentieth-century notions of friendship appear cold compared to the passionate devotion seventeenth-century men displayed toward their friends. 6 Richard Rambuss, "Pleasure and Devotion: The Body of Jesus and Seventeenth- century Religious Lyric," in Queering the Renaissance, Jonathan Goldberg, editor (Durham and London, 1994). 7 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Epistemology of the Closet (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1990) 140. ° Rambuss, "Pleasure and Devotion," 253-279. 9 Rambuss, "Pleasure and Devotion," 253. 10 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire (New York, 1985) 5. H Sedgwick, Between Men, 5.</page><page sequence="4">64 DUSHAN BEDNARSKY Among the educated Renaissance elite, the idea of friendship owed much to classical Greek and Roman idealization of friendship between men, especially as expressed by Cicero in De amicitia} During the Renaissance it was far more important for a man to decide where his emotional loyalties lay than to think in terms of genital sexuality. As Bruce Smith has pointed out, the question confronting a young man at sexual maturity in Shakespeare's day was not, "am I heterosexual or am I homosexual?," but "where do my greater emotional loyalties lie, with other men or with women?" It was usual for a seventeenth- century gentry man to spend virtually his entire life in same-sex company (e.g. the grammar school, the university, the church, the military) and it was typical of seventeenth-century men to favor strong emotional attachments with companions of the same sex.14 For Tuptalo, as for any other European intellectual of his time, all forms of friendship would have been considered in some way carnal - i.e. some sort of physical action is required for friendship to take place: the feet must carry a person to the place where he sees his friend, his tongue must speak words of friendship to him, and so on. On a sexual level, most seventeenth-century men viewed personal relationships as at least potentially erotic. Thus, it is possible to consider Tuptalo' s relationships with other men in the context of what 12 Cicero, [Laelius de amicitia] (Milan, 1985). See the English translation by John Harington in Ruth Willard Hughey, John Harington of Stepney, Tudor Gentleman: His Life and Works (Columbus, Ohio, 1971). 13 Bruce R. Smith, Homosexual Desire in Shakespeare's England: A Cultural Poetics (Chicago, 1991) 32. 14 The subjects of homosexuality, homosociality, and same-sex relationships in Early Modern Ukraine have not yet been subjected to a systematic study. D. Iavornyts'kyi's monumental study on the Ukrainian Cossacks contains his interpretation of same-sex relations in the Cossack society. He describes a ritual service known as pobratymstvo - "making of brothers" (see the order of this ritual i η Iavornyts'kyi, Istoriia zaporiz'kykh kozakiv [L'viv, 1990] vol. 1, 182). Two Cossacks, having formed a close relationship, swore a ritual oath of brotherhood to one another in the Sich church. The ritual began with an oath to love one another, which was then signed by the two men. This was followed by a prayer, or the appointed Gospel reading. The two men exchanged crosses, kissed each other three times, and then exited the church as brothers, to the end of life. In explaining the motivation for such a ritual, Iavornyts'kyi points to the needs of Cossacks to form close, emotional attachments to one another: "The Sich Cossack, as a human being, possessed soul and heart, and felt the need to love someone, to draw close to someone, but was not permitted to love women..." (cíhobhh KO3aK λκ jiioAHHa Mae flyiuy η cepue, BiflHyeaB noTpeóy Korocb jik)6hth, no Korocb npHXHJiHTHCJi; ajie jiioóhth &gt;KÍHKy He Mir-Iavornyts'kyi, 182) i.e. women were banned from the Sich. Hence, as Iavornyts'kyi proposes, the Cossack would turn to another man to satisfy his emotional needs. On the other hand, Iavornyts'kyi lists "relations with women" and "the sodomite sin" as sexual activités that were forbidden among the Cossacks (Iavornyts'kyi, 150). Iavornts'kyi does not explain the category of "sodomite sin"; whether this included all homosexual acts - or whether it included only certain sexual positions - is not known.</page><page sequence="5">TUPTALO' S "VERSES ON THE LORD' S PASSION" 65 Sedgwick terms "homosociality." Sedgwick describes homosociality as a social continuum through which homoerotic desire flows in socially useful ways distinct from homosexuality per se. The same-sex social organization of the seventeenth-century Ukrainian gentry, including the monastic clergy, can be situated on a social continuum where the two activities of men loving men, and men serving the interests of men, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The non-existence of heterosexual and homosexual identities in Early Modern Europe allowed the possibility of every man seeing his relationships with other men as potentially erotic. Orthodox Church laws operated on the supposition that all men may be tempted to engage in homosexual acts, just as all may be tempted to participate in heterosexual acts.15 What creates further complexity is the blur between friendship and erotic love during the Renaissance - these two ideas were not as hierarchically established as they are today. It is not the intention here to drag the Metropolitan of Rostov out of the sexual closet; it is very likely that he was a celibate man. However, one is tempted to posit that his emotional loyalties were clearly toward his own sex, and emotional loyalty was far more important in the seventeenth century than it is today. A letter written to Tuptalo when he was metropolitan of Rostov by one of his students - a Ukrainian or Belarusan - is preserved in the 1842 Sochinenie (i.e. "Collected Works"). The letter demonstrates a young man's devotion to his teacher. In describing his feelings toward the metropolitan, the author, identified only as "a young gentry man" (molodyi panych), writes: cero pa^H λκο MJiaaeHeub cocua CBOÔoflHaro yneHia cymifi, aito oena κτ&gt; pyicaM-b nacTbipa CBoero TeKymifi, ko CeaTHTejibCTBy Bameviy OTuy FocnoflHHy h ApxHnacTbipK) MoeMy πρΗτεκτ&gt;, noa npenecTH-EHiiibifl BaiiiH ceõe noeepraio Hcot, ΛΚΟ OTLja CblHOBCKH FlOHHTafl, ΛΚΟ pa6l&gt; rOCnOAHHy CBOeMy nOBHHyJICfl, ΛΚΟ OBHa nacTbipa Moero 3Haa η rjiaca ero cjiyiua eziHHT&gt; cuh οτ MemiiHX-b OBHarb nacTBH Baiuea ApxHnacTbipcKla, eroxe òjiarocjiOBJifliomyK) μλ /jecHHuy Jiio6e3HO, ÓJiaroroB-BHHO η ycepaHO Jio6bi3aio. 1 7 For this sake, I being like an infant, a suckling of the liberal arts, like a lamb running to the arms of his shepherd, I run to you my Lord Father Hierarch and Archpastor, I fall at your most honourable feet, like a son honouring his father, like a servant obeying his master, like a lamb knowing the voice of my shepherd, listening as one of the smallest lambs of the flock of the Archpastor, whose blessing right hand I piously and sincerely kiss. 15 See Eve Levin's Sex and Society in the World of the Orthodox Slavs 900-1700 (Ithaca and London, 1989). 10 See Joseph Pequigney, Such is my Love: A Study of Shakespear s Sonnets (Chicago and London, 1985). 1' Tuptalo, Sochinenie (Moscow, 1842), bk. 5, 136.</page><page sequence="6">66 DUSHAN BEDNARSKY The young man's representation of himself as an infant in the hands of the metropolitan, suggests a close relationship between the two men. However, we should not dismiss extravagant expressions of personal affection as rhetorical ornament, but Baroque excess should not distract our eyes from the fact that there was undeniably a close attachment between Tuptalo and the author of this letter. Tuptalo even died in the company of one of his young attendants - a youth by the name of Savva, who remained with the dying metropolitan after all others had been dismissed from his bedchamber. The sexuality of seventeenth-century Ukrainian Orthodox clerical society, and the homoeroticism of its devotional life, is a subject that has not been touched by scholars. Dmytro Tuptalo' s "Verses on the Lord's Passion" challenges twentieth-century constructs of human sexuality, and requires that we re-examine the subject of same-sex desire as it was understood in the context of 1 R seventeenth-century Christian Europe. Early modern concepts of love, sex and desire were fundamentally different from our own in that heterosexual and 1 Q homosexual identities did not exist during the Early Modern period. Tuptalo would never have based his identity on his sexual orientation because such an identity was inconceivable, at least until recently, in Western civilization. In the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas held that homosexual desire was innate to all men, and therefore naturally occurring. For seventeenth-century European men, educated in Aristotelian logic, love between a man and a man on the one hand, and between a man and a woman on the other, represented but two distinct species of emotions within one genus of human affections.21 Randolph 18 See James M.

It is difficult, and sometimes dangerous, to apply these notions of homosexuality for the whole of Europe. This is especially true of Eastern Europe, whose cultural practises have not been studied from this perspective. It is reasonable to suggest that in seventeenth-century Ukraine, at least two traditions, the Medieval Byzantine and the post-Renaissance West European, governed the intellectual elite's attitudes to sexuality. Eve Levin has argued that among Slavs, especially among East Slavs, attitudes to homosexuality prior to 1700 were much more tolerant than in Western Europe. Orthodox Church laws were not concerned with sexual identities, but rather with clearly proscribed sexual positions.23 According to Levin, Slavic churchmen, particularly East Slavic, were less hostile to homosexual acts than their counterparts in the West.24 From the late fifteenth to the early seventeenth century, homosexual activity was visible in East Slavic society. Being more open at that time and tolerated than in England, such activity did not attract particular vituperation.25 In the case of the Ukrainian elite, Eastern Church laws forbidding certain sexual activities were likely supplemented by Western Medieval and post- Renaissance approaches to human sexuality. The dominant view on human sexuality in the West is represented by the thought of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas 22 Trumbach, "Sodomitical Subculture," 121. 23 See Levin 200. Levin suggests that Byzantine society inherited two attitudes to homosexuality: the Judaic condemnation of all homosexual acts, and the Hellenic attitude that condemned only some homosexual activities and at the same time considered others acceptable. The Eastern Church Fathers retained this latter distinction, considering some homosexual acts to be serious offences, i.e. those that appeared to subvert a male's dominance, while at the same considering others to be less serious, i.e. those that did not appear to subvert a male's dominant status. 2* Levin 203. 25 As Levin points out, minor homosexual offences received mild penances, similar, and often identical, to the ones given to individuals who practised heterosexual versions of the same activities. Levin offers a model of sexual ethics based on the medieval East Slavic idea of social order: the act of a married woman sexually submitting herself to her husband was desirable because it reinforced the proper order of society. Sex acts that inverted the social order were deemed unnatural. Sexual transgressions that did not appear to subvert social order were considered to be less offensive - whether these acts were between opposite-sex or same-sex partners was of minor concern.</page><page sequence="8">68 DUSHAN BEDNARSKY derived from Aristotle the two categories of natural and unnatural sex acts.26 Natural sex acts did not preclude conception, unnatural sex acts did. Thus late Medieval and Renaissance theologians placed homosexual activities in the category of the unnatural. At the same time, however, Aquinas' s categorization placed rape and incest in the category of natural practices, inasmuch as such cases did not preclude conception. Even if such a categorization was known to the Ukrainian elite, it would likely have been as problematic in Kyiv as it was in the rest of Europe. When it comes to the question of sexuality and Early Modern literary texts, Richard Rambuss and Jonathan Goldberg argue that we cannot speak of sexuality in Renaissance texts in terms of the modern categories of heterosexuality and homosexuality. However, they also argue that the refusal of the term "sexuality" for these texts amounts to a desexualization of them.27 Rambuss points out that while the Renaissance does not differentiate (as we tend to do today) between two types of sexual subjectivizations; he nonetheless finds what Goldberg terms "sites of sexual possibility" outside those engaged in by the married or marriageable couple." One is tempted to suspect that one such site, hitherto unexplored, is the seventeenth-century Ukrainian Orthodox devotional poem. What creates difficulties for today's scholar, removed from this society by three centuries and relying on written texts, is the sometimes immense disparity between what seventeenth-century men said and believed, and what in truth they did.28 Dmytro Tuptalo's concern with chastity, and his disapproval of sexual transgressions (namely, fornication and adultery) are clear. But one can question those scholars who describe his attitudes towards sin, including sexual sin, as "extreme - almost maniacal." Tuptalo's attitudes to sexual transgressions were likely no different from those of the clerical society in which he lived. The 26 For a comparative analysis of Western European and East Slavic notions of "natural" versus "unnatural sex acts" see Levin 198-199. 27 Goldberg, 22; Rambuss, "Homodevotion" in Cruising the Performative: Interventions into the Representation of Ethnicity, Nationality, and Sexuality ■, ed.

In the Ukrainian homilies, however, sexual sins are mentioned almost as often.</page><page sequence="9">TUPTALO' S "VERSES ON THE LORD' S PASSION" 69 sins most frequently mentioned in Tuptalo's sermons are the seven mortal sins: pride, greed, sexual transgression, envy, gluttony, anger and indolence. He fashions entire sermons around this group of seven. ] The two sexual offences mentioned most frequently in his sermons are adultery (npeAíoâodrbucmeo - i.e. sex with another man's wife) and fornication (&lt;5&gt;ryd7&gt;-usually referring to a sexual act with a prostitute, or with any unmarried woman). Both activities violated social codes regulating the sexuality of women. It is within this context that Tuptalo's "Verses on the Lord's Passion" are to be considered. This composition, devoutly fixated on the indicatively male body of Christ, is fundamentally an erotic poem of desire by a male (the author Tuptalo) of another, the divine object of desire Jesus. Tuptalo's ecstatic pinings for union with Christ constitute a love poem that celebrates the author's desire for the unclothed, ravished, male body of Jesus. To avoid misunderstanding, it is necessary to clarify the use of the words "homoerotic" and "homoeroticism." Richard Rambuss, in his study of the devotional poetry of John Donne, George Herbert and Richard Crashaw, argues that the effectively pitched pinings of male poets for union with Christ constitute a body of erotic verse that in the domain of the prayer closet makes the male form visible to desire.33 In Tuptalo's own devotional closet the indicative maleness of Jesus' body functions as a similar kind of cynosure to which the poet is drawn and around which he entwines his poetic imagery. Although a case could be made for the queerness or gayness of the present reading of Tuptalo, this article is conceptualized in terms of two ideas that the Metropolitan of Rostov, as a grammarian and poet, would have clearly understood: gender and erotic desire. Hence, "homo-" or same-sex eros. This paper is concerned with the maleness of the incarnate God, and how the interest of the male poet is aroused by the sight of the naked, wounded body of Christ. Erotic desire between Tuptalo and Jesus is a same-sex desire - a "homo- eros." Both the poet and the object of his desire are male. What is more, this relationship is both personal and responsive, and is physically consummated in the sacrament of Holy Communion. Christianity, in its Orthodox and Roman Catholic forms, offers the possibility of carnal intercourse with God, i.e. to open one's mouth and to allow the flesh and blood of God's Son to be placed into 31 For example, Tuptalo's Sermon of the Feast of St. Michael, coinciding with the 23rd Sunday after Pentecost 1697. See the Ukrainian original in Andrei Titov, Propovedi Sviatitelia Dimitriia Mitropolita Rostovskogo na ukrainskom narechii (Moscow, 1909) 93-107. 32 In Church Slavonic the word oaydnuuß can mean both "prostitute" and ' any woman who voluntarily has sex with a man she is not married to, without financial gain."

In the case of Tuptalo's Passion text, the two principal players, author and subject, possess indicatively male bodies, and male sexualities. The question arises, why would a poet pay such attention to the physical aspect of Jesus, and why should it be important to us today as readers of this work? The answer is theological: the sexuality of Jesus is an essential part of his humanity, and the humanity of Jesus is a fundamental tenet of Christian faith. As Leo Steinberg points out, the sexuality of Jesus is an issue to Christian artists because the virginity of Jesus is an issue.34 Chastity consists not in impotent abstinence, but in potency under check. Jesus was not a eunuch, but a sexual being. To deny Christ's sexuality, to release of him of its temptations, is to decarnify the incarnation. As Steinberg points out, the artistic representation of Christ's body centers on an ostensive act, a palpable truth of Christian theology: God's descent into manhood. In the religious art of the Renaissance and Baroque there is something that the artist expects his audience to take for granted: that the divinity of the incarnate Word needs no demonstration. For Tuptalo, as for any other person nurtured in post-Mohylanian Ukrainian Orthodoxy, the objective in presenting Jesus' body is not so much to proclaim the divinity of the man, but to declare the incarnation of God. In an atmosphere of Catholic Orthodoxy, the preacher is not to waste words persuading believers to believe36 - rather, his office is to stir men to gratitude and delight. The sermons of Tuptalo, as those of other seventeenth-century European preachers, is not so much to teach the divinity of Jesus, but to "dwell on the boon conferred by the Incarnation, to which the Christian's proper response is admiration and praise."37 As is the case with most of Tuptalo's poetry, we know little about his "Verses." If we accept Riezanov's hypothesis that most of Tuptalo's poetic works were written while he was a young monk in Kyiv, these verses would have been composed sometime between the years 1668 and 1675.38 Following Tuptalo's death in 1709, the manuscript, in the author's own handwriting, remained in the collection of the Holy Transfiguration-St. Iakov Monastery in Rostov.39 In 1889 Bishop Amfilokhii of Iaroslavl' published a facsimile of the autograph under the title, Stikhi na Strasti Gospodni Hi Stikhi Strastnye 34 Leo Steinberg, The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and Modern Oblivion (New York) 17. 35 Steinberg 9. 36 Steinberg 9. 37 Bandolini (15th century).

It does not appear to have been intended for the stage: aside from the eleven youths appearing with their passion instruments, it lacks movement. Moreover, we have no record that the text was ever performed on stage. We should not, however, exclude the possibility of a stage performance. Tuptalo wrote many dramas, despite the fact that he never taught rhetoric - a role that normally would have required him to write and produce school dramas. But his dramas could have been performed by students from schools in various locations in Ukraine and Lithuania where he traveled, lived and worked throughout his life: the Kyiv and Vilnius Orthodox Colleges are possible candidates. As well, at the end of his life, Tuptalo founded a grammar school in Rostov - where it is plausible that his own students of Latin and Slavonic could have presented this drama. Whatever the case, let us note that one of the most popular forms of private devotion in the Early Modern period - the devotio moderna - was to meditate, one by one, on the instruments of the Lord's suffering.42 Tuptalo' s poetic legacy 40 Amfilokhii, Bishop of Uglich, Stikhi na Strasti Gospodni Hi Stikhi Strastnye sochinennye Preosviashchennym Amfilokhiem Episkopom Uglichskim, vikariem Iaroslavskoi eparkhii (Iaroslavl1, 1889).

Although Passion poetry per se does not automatically identify the author as a practicer of the devotio moderna, in Tuptalo's case a substantial argument may be made that this kind of prayer occupied a central position in his devotional life. In his "Prayer, or Short Commemoration of the Passion of Christ" (MojiHTBa hjih KpaTKoe CTpacTefi XpHCTOBbix-b BocnoMHHaHie), Tuptalo meditates on the lance that pierces the side of Jesus, and at the same time, he reveals the basic idea of the devotio moderna: KpecTOMT&gt; TBOHMT&gt; aKH KonïeMT&gt; npoH3H OKajiHHoe cepaue Moe, λκο jxà κροΜ-b Te6e ^CHBOTOAaBua Moero hhhto&gt;k hho bo3jho6htt&gt;, η mo aa Ha Te6e pacnaTaro Beer/ja B3Hpaerb, cocTpaacaaa η yMMJumca, rp-fexoM aKH Mep3CKOK) ÓJieBOTHHOio rHymaflCH, bojik) cboio OTCBiia.» η λκο ceo-fc Ha tboh npoMucjn&gt; BO3Jiaraü, h orry/jy Π0Λβ3Η0 ΒΟΟΠρΪΉΤΗ VIIOBafl. ^ Penetrate my wretched heart with your cross, like a lance, so that my heart may love you, my Giver of Life, and [so that it may] - more than anything else - always gaze upon you, crucified; suffer with you; and be moved to compassion; to despise my sin, like despicable vomit; to sever my will and place upon you my worldly cares; and from that place hope to receive that which is beneficial. The central idea represented in the above quote is that of meditation on the sufferings of Jesus as a means of spiritual édification. The Passion of Jesus, represented by the cross, pierces the author's sinful heart like a lance. The response of the heart is loving and personal - it loves Jesus the Giver of Life more than anything else. Rather than being a momentary sensation, this is the response of a continuing relationship: Tuptalo prays that he may always gaze upon the crucified Jesus, co-suffering with his Saviour, and being emotionally moved.44 He seeks to despise his sinfulness, to overcome his will, and to direct his thoughts to Jesus - in this he finds his spiritual refuge. Illia Shliapkin notes that Tuptalo instructed his students in Rostov to remember Christ's Passion during times of suffering, and to say the Lord's Prayer five times in commemoration of the five wounds of Jesus.45 Shliapkin also records one of Tuptalo's dreams, which the metropolitan related to a priest in Rostov. Tuptalo dreamt that he was praying before the cross, and as he prayed, the living body of Christ appeared upon the cross. In his dream, Tuptalo kissed the wounds of Jesus, but then, alarmed by an advancing darkness, awoke. 43 TuDtalo.

St. Demetrius was Tuptalo' s patron saint, and thus, in this poem, he doubtless represents the author himself and his desire to participate in the sufferings of Jesus. In the poem, the bodies of Jesus and Demetrius are respectively wounded by the lances of passion and martyrdom. The relationship between the two men is a tender one: Jesus' relationship to Demetrius is that of mylyi ("dear one, beloved") a standard reference to Christ in devotional literature, the erotic possibilities of which have often been overlooked. Tuptalo's devotion to the sufferings of Jesus is evident in many of his poetic works. Among them are his verses "The Kissing of the Sores or the Wounds of Our Lord Jesus Christ," (U-fcjiOBame yAOBT&gt; hjih pam&gt; Focnoaa Hamero iHcyca XpHCTa), whose title alone is extraordinary.48 Several other passion works are attributed to Tuptalo, including the "Counsel and Pronouncement of Judgement by the Faithless Judges upon Jesus of Nazareth the Saviour of the World," (Co6opi&gt; h cyaa H3peneHie οττ&gt; HeBtpHbixT&gt; cyaefi Ha IHcyca Ha3apflHHHa, CnacHTejia Mipa); and "The Grateful Commemoration of the Sufferings of Christ, and Prayerful Meditation and Lament on the Entombment of his God-carrying Flesh," (EjiaroaapcTBeHHoe CTpacTefi XpHCTOBbixi» BOcnoMHHaHÎe, h MOJiHTBeHHoe pa3MbiimieHÍe η njiam&gt; Ha norpeóeme EoroHOCHaro TtjiecHe).50 Other, shorter passion poems by Tuptalo include the "Garland of Twelve Stars to the Passion of Christ" (B-BHeu, OT ABaHaziecflT 3BfeA CTpacTCM Xphctobum); the "Garland of Twelve Stars, Shining in the Midst of Suffering Inflicted by the Crown of Thorns" (BtHeu, οτ 3β^3α flBaHazjecíiTH, bo CTpaßamH οτ B^Hija TepHoearo bo3cíubuihx); and several smaller works.51 Within this larger context, the "Verses on the Lord's Passion" is but one example of Tuptalo's extraordinary devotion to Jesus' sufferings. In terms of content and structure, however, this text is unique. It is the longest of his passion works, it is the most fully developed, and it follows the three-part 4?

The introduction presents eleven characters, each bearing an object from the passion story (ropes, shackles, nails, etc.). The narrative section consists of ten of these characters elaborating upon the torture of Jesus, each character using the object that he bears as the core around which he builds his monologue. The conclusion is spoken by the eleventh character, who bears the cross upon which Jesus dies.52 The introduction consists of two parts: (1) a thirty-four line monologue delivered by an unidentified speaker, followed by (2) ten couplets spoken by eleven characters, identified as otroky (i.e. youths). The introductory monologue serves a similar function to that of the prelude that would have been recited by the professor of rhetoric at the performance of a school play. As is requisite to a good seventeenth-century sermon, the speaker uses the introduction to inform the audience of exactly what is to unfold: the terrifying - and sensibly (i.e. to the eyes and ears) arousing - spectacle of the Lord's passion: ΟτΜ-BHa 3tjio CTpaiiiHa, οτΜ-BHa HanpacHa, ax, rjiarojioM, 3ptHiio h cjiyxy yacacHa.

The king of heaven and all the earth, the creator of all the world, is handed over by the cruel beast to the cruel ones". Blood and fluids will be featured in the performance that follows: the speaker compares Judas Iscariot and his conspirators to a wolf that thirsts for blood; the lamb of God, upon beholding the cup of death, weeps blood for the sake of our transgression: Οτ lOflbi TpeKjiüTaro η loaeficKHM nojiKOM, arHeu, npeHe3Jio6HBbiH KpoBo^caAHbiM BOJiKOM... njianeT KpbiBaBbiM ποτομ, ax, 3a 3Jio6y Hauiy (311); "From the thrice-damned Judas to the Judean cohort, the most innocent lamb is delivered by the wolf to the blood-thirsty ones... [the lamb] weeps a bloody perspiration - Ah! - because of our wickedness." Thus, the stage performers, the audience, and we the readers of this text, are identified as co-conspirators in Jesus' suffering and death. Bondage, too, will also be part of this display, followed by the piercing of the body through crucifixion: €ro ;»ce, 52 This 10 + 1 = 11 structure for a devotional text is typical of Tuptalo. Another Passion work, Tuptalo' s "Divine Meditation on the Most Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ" (EoroMbicjieHHoe pa3Mbiiujieme ο npecüTbix-b cipacTexT* Focnoaa Haiiiero Incyca XpHCTa) bears the same structure: the Gospel narrative is divided into eleven segments. Ten times, i.e. once after each of the first ten narrative segments, the devotion pauses, the Lord's prayer (Orme naiwb) is recited, and a prostration is made. After the eleventh and final narrative segment, the prayer "Virgin Mother of God, Rejoice" (Eozopoòuu,e Rrbeo padyücH) is recited, and an eleventh prostration is made. This 10 + 1= 11 structure is identical to a Roman Catholic Rosary: on a rosary, the beads are divided into groups of ten, and each group of ten is interrupted by a single bead, making eleven.</page><page sequence="15">TUPTALO' S "VERSES ON THE LORD' S PASSION" 75 BepHraMH CBinaHHa... no npeMHorax MyKax Ha KpecT npHrBO3flHiua (311); "He is bound with ropes. . . and after a multitude of sufferings he is nailed upon a cross." The speaker commands the audience to look upon the instruments of torture and death - rope, scourge, pillar, lance, shackles - thus placing us in the position of voyeurs: Ce Bem 3pH opyzùa yÔHHCTBa h mvkh: BepBb, 6hh, cTOJin, Konie, ^ejitoHbie pyKH (311); "Let everyone behold the instruments of killing and torture: rope, scourge, pillar, lance, shackles." The speaker concludes his monologue requesting that the young boys step forward one by one and receive the instruments of passion. The boys reply, presumably in chorus, saying "having received them, let us approach the most pure body" (IlpieMiiiH, npeMHCTOMy τ-fejiy npezrbHZjtMo) - an invitation to a personal encounter with the incarnate God (31 1-312). To conclude the introduction, each of the eleven youths delivers a rhyming couplet identifying himself with a particular instrument of passion: (1) ropes (2) shackles (3) scourge (4) pillar (5) crown of thorns (6) reed (7) nails (8) hammer (9) sponge with vinegar (10) lance (1 1) cross. These objects, invested with what Sedgwick calls the work of the fetish,53 will move the author's imagination and constitute the basic structure upon which Tuptalo will layer his imagery. The boys again repeat to themselves, "Take the fierce instruments of passion. . .let us approach the most pure body of Christ." Together they sing the Hymn of the Feast (Troparion) in the second tone from Good Friday Vespers, "Noble Joseph, when he had taken thy pure body from the tree. . ,."54 Thus ends the introduction. First Youth: Rope Tuptalo' s narrative discourse begins with the first youth. The young man, bearing a rope, describes the bondage of Jesus at the hands of a Roman soldier. The subject of bondage in Tuptalo is played against a counterpoint of soft, tender images. The youth extols Jesus, the flower of Jesse and the fruit of Mary's womb: Βάκζίοά iecteoB ijb-et cpezj oropoaa, Ba^eTca npHHHCTaro KJiac MapiH njioaa (313); "Bound is the flower of Jesse in the midst of the garden, bound is the most pure fruit of Mary's womb."55 Instead of the soft swaddling clothes with which his mother wrapped him as a babe, a rope is now firmly tied around him by a soldier: Croate nejieHaMH μηγκο noBHBajia, BOHHCica pyica BepBOM TBepA-fefiiiiHM CBinajia (313); "She softly swaddled him in swaddling 53 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Epistemology of the Closet (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1990), 140. 54 The inclusion of this liturgical hymn may suggest that these Verses could have been intended as a public theater performance for Good Friday. 55 In Slavonic the word KJiac literally means "ear of grain."</page><page sequence="16">76 DUSHAN BEDNARSKY clothes, the hand of the soldier binds him with a coarse rope."56 He associates this rope with another frightful object from the Passion story - the rope with which Judas hangs himself: O, 3Jibift IOao, Ha Focnozja tu eepea BO3Jiaraeui, CKopo Ha TBoefi bum caM Bepea zj03Haem (313); "O, wicked Judas, you place a rope upon the Lord, soon you will come to know the rope upon your own neck." After eloquently describing the rope that begines the sufferings of Jesus, the first youth concludes his verse by exclaiming: O Icyce, BepeaMH /jHecb jiiOTE CBfl3áHHbiH, zja a3 τη κ jiioób-e 6yAy Bcenja npHBjreáHHLiH (313); 'Ό Jesus, today with ropes you are fiercely bound, Grant that you and I, forever, in love, together will be bound." In this manner, Tuptalo ties this image of bondage with his idea of love. At the beginning of the poem, Tuptalo reminded us that the body of Christ is a pure body (the most innocent lamb - arHeij, npeHe3Jio6HBi&gt;iH). This theme of Jesus' innocence dominates this first youth's speech (Pope! CBjreajiH arHija, He3Jio6HBa cyma: "Alas, they have tied up the lamb, innocent is he" [312]). The Virgin Mary observes her son's bondage, and the poet mentions the swaddling clothes with which she wrapped her innocent child's flesh (Gro&gt;Ke nejieHaMH μλγκο noBHBajia, 313). Stylistically, of course, the softness the swaddling clothes serves as a counterpoint to the coarseness of the ropes the soldier uses to tie Jesus - the second line of the first youth's couplet on the swaddling clothes accomplishes this: Gro^ce nejieHaMH μλγκο noBHBajia, BOHHCKa pyica BepBOM TBepA^HiiiHM CB.H3ajia; "Swaddling clothes softly swaddled him, the hand of the soldier bound him with coarse rope." What is going on here, however, is not just a stylistic contrast - there is theology at work. When the poet places swaddling clothes in the midst of passion imagery, he is reminding us that there is no shame in Jesus' incarnation. The innocence of Jesus' flesh is central to Christian devotion, for this allows men and women to desire his body. The first youth elaborates on this theme by using flower and fruit imagery: "bound is the flower of Jesse in the midst of a garden, bound is the most pure fruit of Mary's womb" (BaaceTCfl iecbceoB ijb^t cpeA oropOAa, BiUKeTCfl npeHHCTaro KJiac MapiH njiofla, 313) and at the same time Tuptalo is taking advantage of the fact that the arrest of Jesus takes place in 56 The 1992 Kyi ν edition has eepxou cexxiAa - "bound with the upper part." Dl We may compare this bondage theme with several or luptalo s other Passion poems. In his "With Instruments of Passion'* (Co opyAiH cTpacTHbiMH) he says: Ποητο Teo'fc cBfl3aHHbi, Icyce moh, pyirfc? fla He BO36paHHuiH jih cü MynHTejieM β MviTB? Hh!

(Kyiv, 1992) 297.</page><page sequence="17">TUPTALO' S "VERSES ON THE LORD' S PASSION" 77 a garden - Gethsemane. The central point, however, is the innocence of Jesus. For Tuptalo - as for any other European of his time - a man's maleness resides in his flesh, and the manhood of Jesus differs only from that of all other men in one respect - he is without sin. To an early-modern thinker, to turn one's gaze away from the carnality of Jesus' flesh is to demonstrate a lack of faith, for to turn away is to deny the humanity of God's Son. Tuptalo does not resist the desire to look upon Jesus' body - for this body is the blameless, sinless male body of the child born in Bethlehem. It is this vulnerable, innocent, naked male flesh that commands the poet's attention and moves his desire. Second Youth: Shackles The breaking and wounding of this sinless flesh continues when the second youth brings forth the shackles: five rings, which are chained around Jesus' neck, hands, and feet. The shackles accomplish two objectives: they control their victim's movements, and they inflict wounds. The luminous beauty of Jesus' face contrasts with the dark bruises on his flesh left by the iron rings: Gro ^ce CB.HTO jiHue, λκ cojiHue, ciiieT, chhoctíio ^ejifeHa pyica ποτβΜΗϋετ (313); "His holy countenance shines like the sun; the iron shackle makes [it] dark with a blueness." At this point Tuptalo introduces an image that he will repeat throughout the work: Jesus' body is a field, and the metal instruments, like ploughs, open up Jesus' flesh. The idea of representing Jesus' body as landscape is not new to Christian symbolism, the youth reminds us that one of the church's epithets for the son of God is "furrow of goodness": Hnea 6jiara XpHCTOC ecT - TaK ijepKOB BtiuaeT, opeT pyica ^cejiteHa, CMepTy yjBBJiaeT (313); "A furrow of goodness is Christ - thus proclaims the church; the iron shackle ploughs, wounding death." It is interesting, however, that Tuptalo associates of the plough with death - death of course, is followed by rebirth. He will elaborate upon this in the monologues that follow in which Jesus becomes food, i.e. bread (third youth) and seed (sixth youth). Both bread and seed are items connected with the soil and its fruits, and thus they function as extensions of Tuptalo' s landscape topos. The idea of representing the human body as a landscape is 58 Steinberg 17. ■&gt;* Tuptalo' s portrayal Jesus body as a surface of numerous, erotically suffused openings is comparable with that of Richard Crashaw's In vulnera Dei Pendentis {On the wounds of God hanging [on the cross]). This work offers a similar constitution of Jesus' displayed, male body as a landscape of secreting orifices. See the English translation of Crashaw's Latin original in George Walton Williams, The Complete Poetry of Richard Crashaw (Garden City, N.Y., 1970).</page><page sequence="18">78 DUSHAN BEDNARSKY typical of Renaissance love poetry.60 The sources for such a model reach back into antiquity, and this strategy is employed in the Song of Songs. Like a furrowed landscape, the body of Jesus silently submits to the instruments, and the open wounds become a garment, clothing the naked flesh: Bcero τ-fcjia MOJinajiHB Bor £3Bbi Houiaiue, h6o Ta oaeacaoio npHKpHTH He Moacaiiie (313); 'The silent God bore wounds on all his body, for it was impossible to cover them with garments." The idea of the body as fertile ground is central to medieval devotion. As Caroline Walker Bynum has demonstrated, medieval devotional writers did not equate the body with sexual sin or reject the body as evil - rather they saw the flesh as fertile and vulnerable. The enfleshing of God - the incarnation - was the occasion for celebration.62 Bynum argues that the extravagant endeavors of medieval saints to discipline and manipulate the body are not so much flights from physicality as they are elaborate charges rung from the possibilities provided by the flesh.63 Something similar is at work in Tuptalo's poetry - the carnality of Jesus' passion, replete with penetrable body openings and permeable blood, tears and bodily fluid - excites the poet's imagination with all the possibilities offered by the Son of God's flesh. Even in the midst of torture, however, the flesh of Jesus remains a beautiful object of desire. Tuptalo's second youth tells us that the most radiant face of God's son cannot be obscured by godlessly inflicted wounds: ripecB^TJiaro &gt;Ke jiHija κρυτΗ HeBO3MO^KHO, eroxte Ta pyica, ax, vjbbh 6e3(xx&gt;KHo (313); "It is impossible to cover that most luminous countenance; that shackle - Ah! - it wounds him most godlessly." The youth began his speech by directing our attention to the beautiful countenance of Christ, shining like sun in the midst of torture: Cro ace cbjito jiHije, λκ cojiHue, ciaeT (313); "His holy countenance, like the sun, shines." For Tuptalo, the bleeding, macerated face of Jesus is an object of beauty, and his youth expresses his desire to adore it, saying: "O, sweetest Jesus... y ou did not refuse to allow your most holy countenance to be beaten, do not refuse us to gaze upon your face in heaven (O, GnaanaHiiiHH 60 See Gregory Woods, Articulate Flesh: Male Homo- Eroticism And Modern Poetry (New Haven and London, 1987), esp. the first chapter, "The Male Body" in which he deals with the landscape topos of the nude male in Western literature. 61 The 1992 Kyiv edition has Mootcaiue without the negative ne, i.e. "it was possible" - likely a copyist's error. 62 Caroline Walker Bynum, Fragmentation and Redemption.

JlHua th npecBflTaro He BO36paHHJi 6hth, He BO36paHH HaM β Heót jiHije TBoe sp^TH, 313). Third Youth: the Scourge The third youth moves our attention away from the adorable face of Jesus, to his torso. A lash with many points is brought out and the body of Jesus is scourged. The youth elaborates further on the landscape topos, as each point on the lash is like a plough, opening up the soft flesh beneath, until the entire body is rendered a furrowed landscape of bleeding wounds: Pyica jiHije XpHCTOBO noopajia atjio, 6hh h po3ra Bee cb^to noopajiH t-bjio (313); 'The shackle ploughed the face of Christ deeply; the scourge and the switch ploughed all the holy body." Like St. Birgitta of Sweden, Tuptalo imagines Jesus fully disrobed during flagellation.64 From the top of his noble head, to the bottom of his sacred foot, not a single spot on Christ's body is left unscourged: Οτ Bepxy rjiaBbi HecTHoft jxo cBüTyio Hory, He ocTaBHjiH M-fecTa irtjia XpHCTy Bory (314); "From the top of his honourable head to his holy feet; Not a single spot of Christ God they left untouched". At this point, however, the landscape topos presents the idea of Jesus as food. From the ploughed furrows in Jesus' flesh will grow bread, and of this bread we shall partake in heaven: mu ace OTTOJib HeóecHbiH xjitó 6yaeM BKyuiaTH (313); "We, then, from that time, will taste heavenly bread." The third youth implores us to gaze upon Jesus. This exhortation, which of course echoes Pontius Pilate's own "ecce homo, " is a call to voyeurism repeated elsewhere in Tuptalo' s text. This call to voyeurism has an echo in another of Tuptalo' s passion dramas, the "The Counsel and Pronouncement of Judgement of the Faithless Judges Upon Jesus of Nazareth the Saviour of the World" Co6opi&gt; h cyzja H3peneHie οττ&gt; HeB'bpHbix'b cy/jefi Ha iHcyca Ha3apüHHHa, CnacHTejiJi Mipa.65 This unusual text depicts a silent Jesus on trial. Tuptalo gives the following instructions for the staging of this drama: Jesus sits in the (accused's) seat; he wears a crown of thorns; his upper body is naked; his lower body is covered in a red robe; his hands are bound. Obviously he is describing the iconographie representation of the Ecce homo. While Jesus is displayed in this manner, we in the audience look at him, and the members of the counsel speak and pronounce their judgement. 64 St. Birgitta had a profound effect on the depiction of the Passion in European art. See Stephanie Brown, Religious Painting. Christ's Passion and Crucifixion (Oxford, 1979), 25. 65 The work does not survive. Shliapkin (72-76) gives only an outline of this text. 66 See examples in Brown Religious Painting.</page><page sequence="20">80 DUSHAN BEDNARSKY Following the youth's instructions to look, in our imaginations we behold Jesus standing up to his knees in a pool of his own innocent blood: 3pH yMOM, nejiOB-fene, Ha Boäiü cbma, KaKO β hhctoh ch κροΒΗ ctoht no KOJitHa (314); "Look with your mind, Ο man, on God's Son - how he stands up to his knees in his pure blood." The flow of blood assumes epic proportions, and the youth compares it to the flood of the Red Sea overwhelming not only Pharaoh and his army, but our multitude of sins: 3a mh, He6jiaroaapHa, rope, yew, rope, pa3JiHCü, icpoee npeHHCTa, aKH HepMHO Mope. IIorpy3HBbiH bo MopH 4&gt;apaoHa porH, ποτοπη β tbogh κροΒΗ Hama rptxH μηογη (314); "For me the ungrateful one - Ο woe! Ο sorrow! Ο woe! It is spilled, the most pure blood, like the Red Sea. You, who drowned the trumpets of Pharaoh in the sea, drown our many transgressions in your blood." At this point we see a dynamic reversal: Jesus is no longer a ravished object: the torrent of blood erupting from his body drowns a physical army of Egyptians, and a spiritual legion of transgressions. Fourth Youth: the Pillar After marveling at the ocean of warm liquid flowing from Jesus' openings, Tuptalo then moves to a different sensory experience: the hardness of the pillar against which Jesus is scourged. The fourth youth speaks: Ctojui TBepabifi, rjiaea UepKBH, XpHCTOC, Bor Ha3BaHHbiH, κ ceMy hcmhjiocthbho CTOJiny npHBii3aHHbiH (314); God is called a firm pillar, the head of the church, Christ; he is mercilessly tied to this pillar." The idea of Jesus as food reappears: Tuptalo alludes to Judas dipping his hand in the dish with Jesus at the Last Supper. He invites Judas to eat bread and salt, and to drink the blood of Christ: ΠρίΗΑΗ CBMO, IlOflO, HM *Ce OMOHHCfl XJltó Β COJ1HJIO Η CHtfleH, ΚρΟΒβ XpHCTa βπηηοη (314); "Come here, Judas - he who dipped the bread in the brine and ate - become intoxicated on the blood of Christ." The poet thus reverses Jesus' role as the penetrated, for now his bodily liquid enters another man's body, as Judas drinks the blood of the teacher he loved, and then betrayed. The act of Judas drinking the blood of Jesus represents the sacrament of Communion - indeed, the central act of Christian worship involves the ceremonial eating of this body and the drinking of this blood. But on a another level, Tuptalo, like other educated European of his day, would have associated the blood of Jesus with another fluid: milk. Caroline Walker Bynum has pointed out that, for late medieval and Early Modern intellectuals, there were four categories of bodily fluids corresponding to the four humours.69 In the category 67 The 1992 Kyiv edition has naMUAocmueno , "most mercifully." 68 The 1992 Kyiv edition has enucn "he became intoxicated" rather than the imperative enuücn "become intoxicated!" 69 Bynum, Fragmentation and Redemption, 109.</page><page sequence="21">TUPTALO' S "VERSES ON THE LORD' S PASSION" 8 1 of blood there were three substances: blood itself, mother's milk, and semen. Milk was a kind of blood, transformed by a woman's breast into food for her child. Hence, medieval art intertwined images of the milk that flowed from the Virgin Mary's breast with the blood that flowed from her son's wounds at Golgotha. Hence the idea of blood - by extension, milk - as nourishment intertwines the idea of holy sacrament with the fleshly properties of human secretions. Although we do not know whether Tuptalo was familiar with the physionomies of Aristotle and Galen, the fact that he associates one bodily fluid - blood - with the act of nourishing oneself - indicates a categorical way of thinking that permeates Christian thought. Tuptalo' s association of blood with seed is not surprising, when we keep in mind that medieval physicians considered semen, like mother's milk, to be a kind of blood. In Tuptalo' s passion imagery these bodily fluids intersect along the lines of what Richard Rambuss calls the chiasma of erotic and religious devotion.70 Blood becomes milk, for Jesus' blood is offered to us a nourishment in the sacrament of Communion. Blood becomes seed, for the blood of Jesus brings life to the earth. As is the case in Richard Crashaw's poetry, Tuptalo's longing for redemption is corporealized in terms of a thematics of bodily permeability and penetration. The portal for drawing near to Christ is a bodily orifice - one enters Christ, or is entered by him, and then is engulfed in the salvific liquids that flow from his body.71 Not only does Tuptalo fill Judas' mouth with Jesus' blood, but Jesus himself becomes invaded by his own bodily fluid. The youth observes: JIioa, H^ce zjpeBjie β cmnn-fc rjiac οτ Bora cjibima aa He cjiijiiiht, κροΒίΐο ycTa 3arpaAHiua, 314; The people that in ancient times heard the voice of God from a pillar; let them not hear [it], His mouth has been stopped with blood"). The dynamic of flowing blood reverses itself as Jesus' mouth is filled, overwhelmed and rendered powerless by the very liquid emanating from his own wounds. The youth concludes his verse with a prayer, urging the naked Jesus to destroy his enemies: H3pHHH CTOJin cefi, noóifi τβολ eparn, aa norHÓHyT mhjiocth tbogh bob'bk HarH (314); "Strike down this pillar, defeat your enemies, let them perish forever by your naked loving-kindness." Fifth Youth: Crown of Thorns The fifth youth brings forth the crown of thorns. The thorns represent the sins of the world, and they inflict further sufferings on God's son. The theme of 70 Rambuss, "Homodevotion," 85 71 Rambuss, "Homodevotion," 85 /z Instead ot no?uõnym, the lyyz Kyiv edition nas noPMoum - grammatically impossible.</page><page sequence="22">82 DUSHAN BEDNARSKY penetration returns, as each thorn plunges and pierces into the flesh of Jesus: Ho noHiiace TepH β rjiaey rjiyóoKO yioaeT... κτο B-fccTb: Tepme jih Ty hjih Mip npoH3aeT? (314); "But the thorns are worn on the head and [they] deeply wound... who can tell: is it thorns, or is it the world that punctures [his head]?' The image of the earth being ploughed is repeated, as each thorn carves a furrow into Jesus' face: He 3eMJia jih npopacTH Tepme Ha rjiaey? (315); "Is it not the earth that sprouts forth thorns on [his] head?' But penetration is not the only action we observe. More bodily fluids flow from Jesus' body: blood from his wounds, and tears from his eyes. The eruption of bodily fluids assumes deluge- like proportions as an ocean of tears streams from the holy countenance. Blood flows everywhere, and Jesus is once again ravished by his own blood, as his remaining orifices - eyes, ears and mouth - drown in the sea of blood: Ax, CBflT-EHLlliH OH Η Β KpOBH yTOÍiaiOT, JIHIje CBÜTO Η V11IH KpOß'lO 3anJIbIBaiOT (314); Ah! - the most holy eyes drown in blood, the holy countenance and ears swim in blood." In the midst of this extravagant horror, Tuptalo proclaims Jesus' beauty, a rose amid thorns: TepH apeeecaM cct uapeM, rjiaea, npecTOJi Bo^a, oKpoeaBJieHHa β TepHH, Bor KpacH-feeT po^ca (314); 'The thorn is the king of trees, the head - the throne of God; all bloodied amid thorns, God blushes like a rose."73 Amid the overwhelming flood of blood and tears, Tuptalo recalls the story of the sower from the Gospels: the liquids of Jesus are a heavenly seed that falls upon the earth: HcnoßtcTb, H^ce BtcTb ο eeaHrejicKOM 3épHH, XpncToc, 3épHO HeóeceHO, nazie huh-b β TepHH (315); "He who knows of the seed of the Gospels will confess Christ, the heavenly seed, [who] now falls amongst the thorns." Thus Jesus' role is again reversed: he is no longer a furrow, an object to be penetrated, he becomes the seed itself that penetrates the soil. He is the source of the emanating fluids and he is the receptacle into which the precious life- giving liquid flows. 73 Jesus appears as a flower elsewhere in Tuptalo' s passion works. For example, the following line from Tuptalo's "Garland of Twelve Stars to the Passion of Christ" (B-feHeu OT ßBaHcweciiT 3β^λ crpacTeM Xphctobmm): ICYCE, TepHOB B-fcHeu. HOCHBbiH yacacHbiH, β ΗβΜ κροΒίκ) öarpeH 6mb, aKH poac uB-fcT KpacHbiH ("JESUS, wearing a frightening garland of thorns, in it [he] became scarlet, like the red flower of a rose."( (Ukrains'ka poeziia. Seredyna XVII st. 287). Compare also Tuptalo's poem, "Why did you condescend to walk, your head crowned in thorns?" (Ποητο rjiaea β TepHiH h3bojih χολητη?): flocTOü [fi]uie, ho ποηοκ Xphctoc ecTb nepBJieHHa Poaca, BJiacHOio KpOB [bi]io β CTpacTex oõarpeHHa, A npH poacfc oõbiHH-fe Tepme 6bmaeT, TtM b3üji τβρΗ, aa, λκ poaca, β TepmH npouetTaeT ("It was fitting, because Christ is a red rose, made scarlet by His own blood of passion. But a rose usually has thorns. [Christ] took the [crown of] thorns, so that like a rose he should flower amidst thorns") (Ukrains'ka poeziia. Seredyna XVII st. 294). The idea of calling Jesus a flower is not new: the twelfth ikos of the Akathistos hymn to Jesus describes him as "sweet-scented flower" (u,erbme ÔAazoeóuHbiu).</page><page sequence="23">TUPTALO' S "VERSES ON THE LORD' S PASSION" 83 Erotic role reversals are not unique to Tuptalo. Rambuss indicates that in Crashaw's poetry such reversals are common. In Crashaw's "Hymn to St. Theresa," Teresa of Avila, having been ravished by her angelic visitor, grasps the shaft of his dart and proceeds to penetrate his body. In Tuptalo' s devotion the male body of Christ is in turn penetrating and penetrable. There is a risk that a modern reader may perceive a kind of feminization in the penetrated body of Christ, based on a modern assumption that those who penetrate perform a male function, and those who are penetrated, a female. Rambuss points out that this not the case: a male body that is penetrated remains a male body, just as female body that penetrates remains female. Examples of erotic role-reversal in devotional poetry are too numerous to cite here, but the maleness of Jesus' penetrated, ravished flesh in the works of Donne, Crashaw, and Herbert is never doubted. Indeed, Jesus is a versatile performer in the erotics of devotional poetry, being able to himself be penetrated, and to ravish his devotees. To a seventeenth- century European, a man's maleness was constituted by his male flesh, it was not dependant on sexual activity. As has been argued above, seventeenth-century male identities survived intact, even when a man invited another man to penetrate him. Hence a religious poet may express his desire to penetrate Jesus' flesh (Crashaw) or he may express his desire to be sexually ravished by Jesus (Donne). In the case of devotional practise, there can be no accusation of sin. In Tuptalo' s "Verses" there is no doubt concerning the masculinity of the subject for the manhood of Jesus is a doctrine of Orthodox faith. This desire is consummated in the sacrament of Communion. Seventeenth- century worshippers were as much aware of the carnality of this sacrament, as they were of its spiritual meaning. The act of Holy Communion has a carnal requirement: two bodies are necessary to perform this kind of intercourse - the body of the communicant, and the body of Jesus. The act of Communion is constituted by the physical insertion of the body of Jesus into the body of the communicant. Medieval and Early Modern religious thinkers were not blind to the sexual connotations of this action, nor did they avert their eyes away from it.74 Sixth Youth: Reed and Garment The opening and piercing of Jesus' body is interrupted by the sixth youth, who brings forth the reed and purple robe in which the Roman soldiers dress Jesus. He describes how the soldiers mock Jesus and strike him. In addition to preserving the continuity of the gospel narrative, this scene elaborates upon another precious fluid that flows from the body of Jesus - tears: 74 See Mary E. Giles, The Poetics of Love (New York-Berne-Frankfurt am Main, 1986).</page><page sequence="24">84 DUSHAN BEDNARSKY riecTpHiu, aKH ÓHcepoM, cjie3MH óarpaHHuy, njioBymHMH cnjianjiHBy CBüTyio s^HHiry.

Why do you weep, when they cry 'Rejoice' to you? [Christ] weeps, because, together with these words, [the men] spit upon him. Seventh Youth: Nails After the shedding of tears, Tuptalo's narrative returns to the rituals of torture and death. The seventh youth brings forth the nails to crucify him. The erotic symbolism of these objects is obvious when the poet compares them to keys, i.e. something that is inserted into something else. In the original manuscript the line containing this reference is fragmented - it lacks a verb. The subject of the sentence is wounds, the word "nails" is in the instrumental case, and "nails" is modified by the phrase "like keys," i.e., Γβο3ζγμη, aKH KjnonaMH, ü3bh - (316); "Nails, like keys, [puncturing] the wounds."75 The text that follows is missing. The usual action of keys, of course, is to unlock or to open. Keys may unlock various objects, containers, doors. Jesus' body is thus presented as a penetrable object, something to be opened up. Tuptalo, like any Baroque artist, would not have failed to see such a convention as anything but a sign of erotic communion, carnal and spiritual.77 Eighth Youth: Hammer In Tuptalo's poetics, however, the act of penetration is followed by release of fluids. The eighth youth bears the hammer that drives the nails into Jesus' flesh, and this action is followed by an eruption of four rivers of blood. The landscape topos returns as the four rivers flow from the four wounds, and they remind us of the four last things to be remembered "Death," "Judgement," "Hell," and 'The Kingdom." But the erotic imagery becomes entangled as the eruption of these rivers coincides with the return of the topos of Jesus as food, as the poet identifies Jesus as the giver of eternal fruit: Paß MbicjieHHbiH, Icyc Ham, ziajiH 75 The editors of the 1992 Kyi ν edition suggest for the missing word, npoõodouta, "puncturing." 76 The idea of Jesus as a container is comparable with George Herbert s Passion discerpta" in which he imagines the wound opened up by the soldier's spear as transforming Jesus' body into a pouch in which love letters are deposited and sent to heaven. See the English translation in Mark MacCloskey and Paul R. Murphy, The Latin Poetry of George Herbert: A Bilingual Edition (Athens, Ohio, 1965). 77 Steinberg makes such a case for recognizing gestures of erotic communion ι η Renaissance sacred art (Steinberg 3).</page><page sequence="25">TUPTALO' S "VERSES ON THE LORD' S PASSION" 85 njiojx bob^kh, c MeTbipex Λ3Β neTbipe hctohhji HaM p^kh (316); "Paradise of the intellect, our Jesus, giving fruit forever; from [his] four wounds he pours four rivers to us." Once again we observe the movement between Jesus' penetrability, and his emanation of fluids, and now to the edible fruit that he provides.78 The theme of penetration becomes further entangled with the presence of the Virgin Mary at this scene. As the iron hammer drives the nails into the body of Jesus, the heart of Mary is pierced by swords: CoKpyuieHHO η cepaue Mara HM-feuie, eraa 3ByK cero MJiaTa rB03flame cjibiuiauie, Cicojib yzjapOB, cTOJib Meneft HM^jmie β cepzjijH, erzja hcmmjiocthbho pacnauia Mopaepubi (316); "The mother's heart was broken, when she heard the sound of the nailing hammer. So many strikes, each one was like a sword to [her] heart, as the torturers mercilessly cricified [him]." Mary's wounds, however, allow 7Q penetration only, she does not unleash a torrent of emissions as does her son. Ninth Youth: Sponge with Vinegar The ninth youth brings forth the sponge with vinegar for Jesus to drink. He contrasts the bitterness of the drink with the desirability of the one who drinks, addressing Jesus as "All-sweetness, desire, beloved Jesus:" B[e]ecb cjiaaocTb, ^cejiaHie, Icyc BO3Jiio6jieHHbiH, ropecriio npe3 ciio TpocTb ecT HanoeHHbift (316); "All-sweetness, desire, beloved Jesus, is given bitterness to drink by this reed." Not only does Jesus drink, but he spurts forth his own liquid, as an ocean of sweetness in the form of tears flows from his eyes: Mope yriHBaüftcfl cjiazjocTH ποτοκομ, OT oÓHJiia aoMy, ero ace β ^kcctokom (316); "The sea, becoming intoxicated by the stream of sweetness from the abundance of his house, in suffering." The self-ravishing element returns when the thirsting Jesus 78 Compare the iconographie representation of the unclothed, or at least semi-clad Jesus as wine-master, in which a vine of grapes grows out of the orifice in his side and into the winepress that he operates. The State Museum of Ukrainian Fine Arts in Kyiv has on display two well-known examples of this icon: the "Icon of Christ The Grape Vine" and the "Icon of Christ Shedding Blood." See Spirit of Ukraine: 500 Years of Painting (Winnipeg, 1991), 130 (fig.9) and 140 (fig. 14).

Tenth Youth: Lance The tenth youth appears, bearing the lance that pierces Jesus' side. He calls upon us to gaze at the figure of God hanging upon the cross, and to observe the soldier who pulls out his lance and inserts it into our beloved Jesus. Once again the topos of Jesus as food returns as out of the wound flows sweetness, an indescribable sweetness, the sweetness that is Jesus, who is the source of all sweetness: FopKyio Bflara £3By XpHcry, po3T&gt;üpeHHUH, cjia/jocTH HcnojiHHCfl, cyujH npocB-BmeHHbiH.

Eleventh Youth: the Cross The eleventh and final youth, bearing the cross, speaks. His oration serves as the text's conclusion. He invites the bystanders on Golgotha (and we the readers are included) to gaze upon the crucified God and to meditate upon his sufferings: Bcfe MMMOxozmmiH, óojitoHb XpHCTa sp^Te, ame óojitoHb, m õojiteHb ero ecT, CMOTp-BTe.

Say with your mind, Jesus rests upon the cross; how he expired upon it, who can deny [this]?" Once again his nakedness is indicated, as the youth asks the unclothed Jesus, "You who are naked, cover me, and clothe yourself with light" (τω, Har, mh OKpbiBaeui, ozj-bjihcji cb^tom! 317). The instruments of torture and death are again listed, and once again the youth commands us to look upon Jesus. He praises the Passion of Christ, asking how anyone can deny the frightful pain and suffering endured by God. The final words of the eleventh youth, and of Tuptalo's work, echo the crux sola est theologia nostra of Martin Luther - Ha KpecT'fe cnaceme Haiue yMHpaeT, icpovrfc KpecTa cnaceHiü zja Hwcmace naeT (318); "Our salvation dies upon the cross; no one has hope of salvation except by the cross."81 The interplay between Jesus' body as penetrable and penetrating, ravished and ravishing, is evident from this analysis. However, one can argue for the possibility of an alternative reading of this text. Tuptalo's devotion to the body of Christ may represent a more abstract, Platonic notion of erotic love for the divine. In such a case one would reiterate the crucial distinction made by Mallory: the basic difference between the erotic love of the "One" in Platonism and the Christian erotic love of God is not so much the actual physical basis of the love, but rather the object of that love. In Platonism, the object of erotic love is impersonal and unresponsive, whereas the object of Christian erotic love, Jesus, is personal and responsive. Another problem with a purely abstract interpretation of this work is the extravagance of the carnal imagery that is present. Tuptalo starts with a vulnerable, naked male body and proceeds to elaborate upon the numerous ways in which this body is opened up by various instruments of torture. After rendering Jesus' body penetrated and ravished, he then reverses the dynamic: the macerated body becomes a source of streaming fluids, as a sea of blood, tears and water erupts, flooding the scene and overwhelming the readers' imaginations. And then, the erotic interplay becomes further complex, as Jesus himself is ravished by the very fluids erupting from his body. Such an astonishing display of the carnal possibilities offered by Jesus' flesh is very much in keeping with the Baroque sensibilities of Tuptalo's time. 81 Luther's Confession of Faith was indeed found on Tuptalo's library shelf, but the question of Martin Luther's influence on Tuptalo's theology is yet to be explored. For more on Luther's theology see: Alistair McGrath, Luther's Theology of the Cross (Oxford, 1985); Jan D. Kingston Siggins, Martin Luther's Doctrine of Christ (New Haven and London, 1970). For Tuptalo's library see: Shliapkin, Sv. Dimitrii, appendix, 54-58.</page><page sequence="28">88 DUSHAN BEDNARSKY The presence of blood and bodily fluids in Tuptalo's "Verses" bears theological consideration - for it serves as testimony to God's humanation - and it indicates an understanding of the world that is as much carnal as it is spiritual. For a Christian artist of the Baroque this kind of ceremonial display of Christ's body and blood serves as a touchstone for spiritual life. The most sublime moment in the life of a Christian is when his body becomes one with the body of Christ in the sacrament of Communion. A seventeenth-century European writer would not have failed to see the connection between the sacrament of Holy Communion and erotic discourse. As Bynum and Steinberg point out the symbols contained in the art of the Middle Ages - and of the Baroque - were far more complex, or polysémie as anthropologists say, than modern people are aware.82 They are rooted in theology and piety. Tuptalo's work represents a symbolic richness that Western art and literature in the modern period have lost. There is a danger in approaching Tuptalo's work from the perspective of modern dichotomies. Modern minds are accustomed to thinking of the sexual and the spiritual as mutually exclusive categories. Clearly this is not the case with Tuptalo. In her discussion of medieval devotion, Caroline Walker Bynum demonstrates that medieval devotional writers did not reject the body as evil, but saw flesh as fertile and vulnerable, and God's incarnation as something wonderful and astonishing. Tuptalo's response to Christ's passion is in harmony with the piety of other European mystic poets. The thirteenth-century Italian mystic Angela of Foligno (1248-1309) considered all of Christ's members - his eyes, nipples, lips, and so on - as testimony to his humanation.84 The devout soul responds to this enfleshing with all it bodily capabilities. Tuptalo demonstrates a conviction that those who love Christ should respond to all of his body with all of theirs. Tuptalo's "Verses on the Lord's Passion" reveal the poet's sense of astonishment and wonder at the incarnation of God, and a desire for spiritual and carnal communion with God's Son. Herein lies our understanding of the poet and his sexuality. The Gospels command the believer to love God with all his strength. The body is the most immediate object that the believer posseses with which to love his God. Sexual possibilities are innate to the body - if Tuptalo is to love God with all his body, then his sexuality can not be ignored. The devotional homoeroticism of Tuptalo's "Verses on the Lord's Passion" is not an anomaly. It is in harmony with the tradition of Medieval and Early Modern devotional poetry. The instructions of Tuptalo's eleventh youth, to gaze 82 Bynum, Fragmentation and Redemption, 116. 83 Bynum, Fragmentation and Redemption, 116. 84 See Angela Foligno, Complete Works, translated with introduction by Paul Lachance (New Yorl, 1993), series = The Classics of Western Sprituality.</page><page sequence="29">TUPTALO' S "VERSES ON THE LORD' S PASSION" 89 at the wounds of Jesus and meditate on his sufferings, reveal this text as a modern devotion - the devotio moderna of Renaissance humanism. Mary Giles, in her study of the sonnets of Juan de la Cruz, explores the erotic imagery of Renaissance devotional poetry, and proposes that eroticizing the sufferings of Jesus is an essential feature of the humanist modern devotion. Tuptalo's ecstatic pinings on the Passiones Christi are therefore to be approached from within the context of the devotio moderna and its effects on the Early Modern religious lyric. His "Verses" display a poetics of homoeroticism comparable to that found in the devotional works of the English humanists Crashaw, Donne and Herbert.86 The possible link between Dmytro Tuptalo and the humanist devotio moderna deserves to be explored further. In the metropolitan's library we find at least two titles that suggest he consulted the modern devotion: Historia passionis 87 Christi (possibly that of Thomas More), and Carmen de passione Christi. According to Shliapkin, the latter text - in Tuptalo's own writing - was similar to a medieval sermon for Good Friday by Cyril of Turov, containing an encomium for Joseph of Arimathea.88 Tuptalo's "Verses on the Lord's Passion" bears many features of the devotio moderna, including the structural division of the work into a sequential progression, based on the passion narratives from the Gospels, and meditating upon each sequence in order. This is the same dispositional strategy employed by Thomas More in his Historia passionis Christi*9 The influence of the Renaissance via moderna on Ukrainian devotional 85 See Mary E. Giles, The Poetics of Love (New York-Berne-Frankfurt am Main, 1986). See also: Eugene A.

In conclusion, it can be said that an erotic interplay exists between the Tuptalo and the object of his desire. The interplay is erotic because the desire is as much carnal as it is spiritual: the body of the poet seeks the flesh of Jesus. Tuptalo's eroticization of the body of Jesus is conscious; he was aware of what he was doing. The reason for this is theological: Tuptalo's writing celebrates the incarnation of God's Son, and affirms the personal, responsive relationship between the individual Christian and Jesus. The "Verses on the Lord's Passion" constitute a homoerotic devotional poem: one in which male desire for a male deity is expressed in the form of a love lyric on the naked and ravished body of Jesus. Tuptalo's spirituallife is anthropomorphic and libidinal: his emphasis on love and joy, his erotic desire for a personal and responsive relationship with Jesus, place him within a continuum of European mystical writers and poets that include Terea of Avila and John Donne. The point at which Tuptalo's "Verses on the Lord's Passion" intersect with the erotic devotional poetry of other writers of the Baroque is the devotio moderna - the devotional movement, which profoundly changed Christian spirituality in the Early Modern period. RESUME Les "Vers sur la Passion de Notre Seigneur" de Dmytro Tuptalo présentent à outrance une manifestation voluptueuse du désir du poète pour le corps de Jésus. Le texte célèbre l'humanité du Dieu Incarné, et explore les possibilités offertes par la chair du Christ. Le désir de Tuptalo pour une communion charnelle et spirituelle avec Dieu est une version ukrainienne orthodoxe du dix-septième siècle de l'exercise spirituelle connue comme devotio moderna - la méditation sur les souffrances de Jésus comme moyen d'édification spirituelle - qui a commencée au début de la Modernité. Ce texte montre la capacité d'un poète text was never completed - he composed the work while imprisoned in the Tower of London, and was executed before he could finish it. It ends with the naked young man fleeing from the garden of Gethsemane as Jesus is arrested (Mark 14: 51-52). 90 Ruth Burrows describes Teresa as "an obessed, enamoured creature, ravaged with desire, a hungry emptiness nothing can satisfy" (Ruth Burrows, Interior Castle Explored: St. Teresa's Teaching on the Life of Deep Union with God [London, 1981], 109). In this same book Burrows presents Teresa's idea of Jesus as marriage partner (111) and Teresa's mystery of passionate love and union with Jesus in mystical union (117ff.)</page><page sequence="31">TUPTALO'S "VERSES ON THE LORD'S PASSION" 91 ukrainien du dix-septième siècle d'utiliser la sexualité libidinale dans sa vie de prière, et d'unir harmonieusement le monde de la chair avec celui de l'âme.
